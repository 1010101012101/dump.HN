Programmers all hate women!), especially from a position of power and political influence,  people will start to believe it. Encouraging and (in some cases, like donglegate) inducing both an atmosphere of fear and paranoia in and towards women is incredibly detrimental towards the general humanitarian goal of bettering society.<p>There are isolated instances of sexism,  but women don&#x27;t really have it hard at all in tech. I&#x27;d say the sex discrimination in favor of women (&quot;affirmative action&quot;) massively outweighs any lingering discrimination against women.",1390345178

Maintaining this ratio, and the reputation of the site as a <i>resource</i> rather than a <i>discussion board</i> is important.<p>I personally jump to StackOverflow results on Google pages because they almost always solve my problem exactly. If the results start being polluted by a bunch of less relevant discussions--which, being popular, are likely to rank well--I would probably stop using SO results as much.<p>On top of this, just leaving a question like this open hurts the question itself as well. There is no reason to want 100 different answers all pointing out the missing space in different words!

This obviously isn&#x27;t representative of all feminisms, but it&#x27;s a pretty common viewpoint here on HN, and it&#x27;s often accepted uncritically. Note I qualified my talk of feminisms in the previous post with &quot;much of feminism says X&quot;, deliberately avoiding saying &quot;feminism says X&quot;.<p>It is not wrong for a women&#x27;s movement to pursue women&#x27;s issues. It is wrong for a women&#x27;s movement to pursue women&#x27;s issues exclusively while lying that it also addresses men&#x27;s issues, subsequently advocating the prohibition of groups that address men&#x27;s issues.<p>There <i>are</i> streams of feminism that are orthogonal to addressing the needs of men. And I&#x27;m addressing those streams specifically. People who say things like &quot;you can&#x27;t have men&#x27;s organizations because every other organization is a men&#x27;s organization&quot; are contributing to these streams.",1390345113

While we&#x27;re huge fans of technology and innovation, wearing a device that has the capability to record video is not appropriate at the movie theatre. At AMC Easton 30 last weekend, a guest was questioned for possible movie theft after he was identified wearing a recording device during a film. The presence of this recording device prompted an investigation by the MPAA, which was on site. The MPAA then contacted Homeland Security, <i>which oversees movie theft</i>.

I ran a virtual car dealership for a while and then started a similar site to carwoo, before carwoo.  It was absolutely crazy.  Six months into it, both my cofounder and I decided it was best to shut it down (amid concerns that his employer might just end up getting all or a significant chunk of our work).<p>The auto industry is a very weird one.  Entrenched in their own way, and I learned that it&#x27;s a zero sum type game where the one willing to stoop the lowest will win.  Going to a few &quot;dealer workshops&quot; I learned psychological tactics to make the customer feel like crap to get them to pay you more money and sign contracts that they would inevitably regret later.  Eventually I realized that in the back it&#x27;s really a financing industry (at least for new cars) and for used cars it&#x27;s a zero sum, get the most you can scenario or bloodsucking buy here pay here deals.<p>After a significant amount of time and money, I was humbled at how much of an uphill battle it was to try to innovate in the industry.  Have been watching CarWoo & TrueCar with a lot of interest (I&#x27;m a fan) since I can feel what they&#x27;re up against.  I&#x27;d like to know why CarWoo feels it&#x27;s time to shut it down.  Tesla has, IMHO, disrupted the new car market to some degree and the industry is dire need of change.  Here&#x27;s to hoping the folks at CarWoo go on to bigger and better things!",1390344562

Some believe it to be due to the damaging effects of medical experiments conducted on African Americans -- eg. the Tuskegee experiment where many were purposefully left untreated for syphilis despite the existence of a simple treatment (read: penicillin). Other reasons include the lack of African American physicians in the media, peer-pressure to pursue other career paths, and financial constraints. Bottom line: there is a racial disparity in the medical field, and those that are underrepresented have some very legitimate reservations for entering that industry.<p>So, the question: Would you be against movements targeted towards Blacks/African Americans meant to both encourage them as well as address their many concerns regarding entering a career in medicine?",1390344519

If this were the case I would have mentioned video games as well as half a dozen other things.<p>The question is this. Why are people in the US wealthier then they have ever been, yet they act poorer and more depressed than ever? Comparing quality of life access to education and health care and relative wealth, &quot;poor&quot; people today would be considered in the middle (or even upper middle) class during the first third of 19th century. They ARE considered upper class compared to the majority of the people in the world today. Why they are they the laziest and have far more self pity then the fore mentioned groups?<p>The answer is that they FEEL disadvantaged and lacking opportunity relative to what they perceive as &quot;everybody else&quot;. They FEEL helpless and hopeless. But this is really an illusion. This perception is formed mostly by watching visual media (television, movies, news ETC).<p>See really the stipend is a bailout of sorts. Something causes them to pity themselves (the false reality of media), and the money causes them to feel better about themselves. More aligned with that illusion.<p>What i am saying is - rather than a bailout, I wonder if just eliminating what caused the problem in the first place would be even better. I know that this is a fantasy because you can&#x27;t just tell people to stop watching television.<p>The television thing is really just a symptom of a larger problem though. The main problem is the loss of Christianity and family. Even atheists cannot disagree with the fact that every legitimate study ever done about those with a strong belief in God concludes that they are harder working, far less depressed, commit far less crime, and stick with their spouses more ETC. (the same types of thing that this stipend seemed to help with). Take that away and of course there will be a big difference in crime, employment, divorce rate ETC. and how that affects future generations (the kids).",1390344299

I probably need to cut down on my sarcasm, especially online, but I&#x27;ve found it to be the most effective &quot;shutup&quot; tool in my bag when dealing with this extreme mindset. As an example, two weeks ago I was at dinner with some folks including a Catholic seminarian and a young USAF officer. The seminarian was commenting on topics related to social justice, something he&#x27;s devoted most of his adult life to, and the need for government involvement. Young officer says he believes taxation is &quot;immoral&quot;, as it&#x27;s taking money from other people by force. My response, &quot;But you&#x27;re paid with tax dollars...&quot;. I didn&#x27;t have to continue that line of thought before he switched topics. I guess the really unfortunate thing is that I&#x27;ve had to use that same line on a number of civil servants and government contractors in this area. They don&#x27;t seem to appreciate the hypocrisy of denouncing the government for taxing them, while being paid with tax dollars, until someone else calls them out on it.

7099022,comment,7097254,7098710,13,0,obstacle1,,,"I didn&#x27;t say that most institutional structures aren&#x27;t dominated by men. I don&#x27;t know whether &quot;most&quot; are or aren&#x27;t -- neither do you. If you figure out a way to quantify that, let me know. Seems like a research grant in the making.<p>I do know, however, that &quot;every other organization is a men&#x27;s organization&quot; is a ridiculous statement. <i>Every other organization</i>? Seriously? In order for that to be true, &quot;men&#x27;s organization&quot; has to be defined in some absolutely meaningless manner where organizations which include women and have women as administrators and are run by women are somehow oppressive &quot;men&#x27;s organizations&quot;. Otherwise the statement is provably false and anyone caught saying it should be instantly discredited.<p>>It&#x27;s the positions of power being dominated by men that makes the institution for men<p>First off, very few men have access to those positions of power. Men who don&#x27;t have access to powerful offices still have issues and need protection. If you weren&#x27;t born rich and to parents with connections, you likely aren&#x27;t becoming a surgeon general or president or even university president. So in what universe can the entire university be termed a &quot;men&#x27;s club&quot;? Where do the men without access to institutional power turn for relief? They are not only excluded from what feminists term the &quot;men&#x27;s club&quot;, feminists fight to disallow them from forming groups to fight for their own interests. Double whammy. Lower-class men get universally screwed over in the blind drive to bring &quot;equality&quot; to positions of power.<p>Second, much of feminism ignores the question of why one-to-one gender representation is desirable in the first place for each and every position of power. Why is it a goal in and of itself? In hiring someone to lead an organization, I want the person with the qualifications that best match the job description to be hired. If that turns out to be a man, great. A woman, great. I don&#x27;t care. There is a job that needs to be done and it should be done well, free from political or ideological influence.<p>There is the argument that even if hiring is completely gender-neutral, if the most qualified people turn out disproportionally men then it is inevitable that male interests will be baked into the system. Well, the man is still the most objectively skilled person for the job maybe you should figure out how to build control mechanisms that prevent male ideologies from perpetuating insidious effects throughout the system, rather than just scream about how men should be barred from the position. Just saying &quot;let&#x27;s hire more women because they&#x27;re women&quot; seems like the laziest possible pseudo-solution and doesn&#x27;t seem to lead to desirable long-term effects. Do we want people running our society who are qualified to do so, or do we want people running society because of gender quotas?<p>Third, there is the question of whether or not these inequalities are systemic because of male oppression or female behavior. It is likely a mix of the two, but feminists completely discount the latter. For example having children is a pretty strong biological drive in human beings. I&#x27;m not saying <i>all</i> women want to have children, but a lot do. So maybe some females aren&#x27;t taking high-powered high-strung positions because they&#x27;d rather have kids. The vast majority of high-responsibility positions can&#x27;t cope with the candidate taking 5 months off for mat leave.<p>There&#x27;s the issue of &quot;oh the females only want kids because they&#x27;re socially programmed to slave away as subservient housewives&quot;. I don&#x27;t know, the nuclear family is a pretty strong element of culture and socialization for sure. But it seems unlikely that given our million-plus-year history of a biological drive to have kids that it&#x27;s all a social construct. Further, that females only have kids because they&#x27;re brainwashed seems unprovable.<p>There are innumerable other issues I could list but what&#x27;s common to all of them, in my view, is that they focus so intently on the end goal of elevating women&#x27;s power status that they bulldoze over all other considerations indiscriminately.<p>We need nuance in order to achieve an actual egalitarian society, which much of feminism -- <i>especially</i> statements like &quot;all other organizations are men&#x27;s organizations&quot; -- beats into the ground with a thousand-pound shovel.",1390343167

The salesman took the offer to his manager. He returned with a counter offer. My roommate didn&#x27;t budge. After three trips to talk to the manager (each time their offer came down), my roommate remained stuck in his price. On the last trip, their offer was just $500 higher than the desired price. Roommate still held his ground. We watched as the two men were discussing the check in hand. The salesman kept pointing at the check.

Sometimes is a historical gap in fields that have a self-perpetuating cycle of dominance (such as women in politics). It is tough to address such underrepresentation, and it take generations to make any change (as it took generations and generations to create the initial gap).<p>This is not the case for black founders. Here we have a much simples issue: stigmatization. At least, this is how most people in this field, including the organizers of this event, seems to classify it. It is easier to address because a cultural perception is easier to change than institutionalized cycles of power (as in politics).<p>And, as I see it, this is the only goal of this event. No one is claiming that blacks are better than whites or asians in founding startups. Or the opposite, that blacks are worse than whites in founding startups and that they need special treatment. This event is only trying inspire blacks, and that founding startups shouldn&#x27;t be stigmatized as a white and asian club. Blacks can have a good life in founding one if they give this thought a chance.<p>So there the only assumptions I see in this event are that: (i) founding a startup is a good thing that they should inspire people to do (something largely supported by HN audience I would guess) and (ii) that blacks aren&#x27;t currently being correctly or ideally presented, attracted and inspired to these opportunities of founding a startup.<p>These two assumptions may be contested. If you disagree with assumption (i) you a have a much bigger fight to pick, basically the whole illusion that Sillicon Valley sells to the world, this event isn&#x27;t particular relevant in this broader debate.<p>And if you disagree with assumption (ii), that this event is not necessary, it means that is no harm done by such an event occurring. It would by useless at most, but not particularly harmful.<p>This is my perception of this, and I am writing it hoping to avoid a thread full of heated debate based on false assumptions.

It&#x27;s so direct that it doesn&#x27;t really qualify as an argument, but merely a restatement of the original position.<p>It&#x27;s like saying that spheres are good, and when asked why, saying that they&#x27;re three-dimensional and round, and three-dimensional round things are good. Is that an argument? I don&#x27;t really think so. An argument is where you state your reasoning in such a way that it could, at least potentially, convince the other person. Merely stating one of your opinions that happens to be related to another of your opinions doesn&#x27;t qualify.<p>Personally, for #1, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything good or bad about a birth. More or fewer births, by themselves, don&#x27;t matter. They take on good or bad qualities based on the context in which they happen. Preventing a birth before anything related even happens is not by itself good or bad, it&#x27;s just something that happens. I&#x27;d wager most of the others on the &quot;pro-contraception&quot; side think likewise.",1390341659

Technically, you can talk about such issue in isolation, but if you really care about your health, you should first solve the bombing problem and then worry about your teeth.<p>My argument is about priorities. If the entire point of blaming Snowden at all is &quot;because national security&quot;, then it&#x27;s important to start solving the problem of &quot;national security&quot; with the most important issues first. The issue number one: the people who supposedly provide you with national security 1) require blind trust from you 2) were abusing that trust 3) always lie 4) have guns and you don&#x27;t 5) immune to the consequences of their actions and you aren&#x27;t.

Here&#x27;s a direct quote [0] from Leslie Lamport, the author of the Paxos algorithm.<p><pre><code>    Assume that agents can communicate with one another by sending messages. \n    We use the customary asynchronous, non-Byzantine model, in which:\n    \n    • Agents operate at arbitrary speed, may fail by stopping, and may restart. \n    Since all agents may fail after a value is chosen and then restart, \n    a solution is impossible unless some information can be remembered by an agent\n     that has failed and restarted.\n    \n    • Messages can take arbitrarily long to be delivered, can be duplicated, \n    and can be lost, but they are not corrupted.\n</code></pre>\nSo, to be clear, Paxos tolerates processes that crash arbitrarily, but not processes that send malicious or incorrect messages.<p>For a consensus algorithm that <i></i>does<i></i> tolerate Byzantine faults, see Liskov&#x27;s Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance [1].<p>[0] - <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/p...</a><p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf</a>",1390341639

(And maybe that&#x27;s enough; maybe the college-educated need their megachurches as well).<p>Like megachurches, TED offers highly-produced &quot;public speaking as entertainment&quot;, but the purported content of the talks isn&#x27;t entertainment, but $SERIOUS_ISSUE being told to you by $PERSON_WHO_KNOWS_BEST.<p>This grates because TED events are inherently artificial; everyone knows that they&#x27;re there to be entertained, despite the <i>trappings</i> of importance. Contrast with political speech, which is (usually) ugly, but has the solidity that comes from serving real (if often equally ugly) purposes.<p>Once might say, hang on -- what&#x27;s so bad about public speaking at TED and megachurches? What&#x27;s the difference between TED/megachurches and, say, standup comedy, or storytelling, or politics?<p>The difference is both 1) honesty, and 2) the role of the audience.<p>Honesty: Speech at TED or a megachurch comes with almost suffocating trappings of weight and import. In contrast, storytelling and standup and all sorts of ordinary entertainment are much more honest and down-to-earth: they don&#x27;t claim to present anything more than a good yarn, some ear-tickling.<p>Audience: In both TED and megachurches, their audience does not expect to think critically, or to in any way hold the speaker to account. They do not expect to ply the speaker with questions later. In contrast, the audience keeps standup comics honest and can turn on them viciously; and politics invites constant comment and criticism from all quarters, of a kind that mostly keeps politicians from indulging in extravagant and exalted speech that could distance them from the everyman.<p>Could we make it more honest? That&#x27;s tough without making TED itself have more of a functional purpose than just entertainment. The world does need exploration and discovery and curated content, but TED&#x27;s format is clearly &quot;preaching as entertainment&quot;, not discussion, and not journalism. It&#x27;s like a Church devoted to episodes of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;.<p>But apart from TED developing its own &#x27;platform&#x27; for change in the world and becoming a more functional organization, to go along with the views it invites ... as a thought experiment, I can imagine for instance having 2 experts on the <i>same</i> subject, each presenting it through their own lens. This would complicate preaching tremendously and keep it much more honest, but it would probably be far more instructive and nourishing to the audience.",1432095909

The comment which spawned your first statement was one that complained about rendering speed. Many people in this thread have noted that by the time an image or document (XML or otherwise) gets to the do-layout-and-render-pixels-on-the-screen stage of the process, it <i>DOESN&#x27;T MATTER</i> how malformed that document was or what format that image was when it came over the wire.<p>Why? Because when we&#x27;re at <i>this</i> stage of the process, that data has been converted into whatever representation is most convenient for the web browser to use while rendering its screen. Just like in a video game, support for a new image type or document type is as &quot;simple&quot; as adding on a converter from $NEW_FORMAT to $BROWSER_INTERNAL_FORMAT.<p>> &quot;Scripted elements&quot; is very, very different from, say, loading an arbitrary IDE into the browser<p>No. It&#x27;s a difference of size, not of complexity. The interpretation and validation tasks are the same in both examples.<p>> On the average, most game scripting languages don&#x27;t support running Ruby, Python, or Erlang interpreters.<p>Heh. Nice of you to ignore my Crash Bandicoot, Jax & Daxter, and every-game-which-supports-lua-scripting examples. Lisp, Scheme, and Lua are every bit as complex as Ruby, Python, JavaScript and -to some degree- Erlang.<p>I&#x27;ve read your other replies in this thread.

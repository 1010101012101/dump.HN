It is identical in spirit to the musician's dilemma.<p>Usually it comes out to something like this, ""Do we take pleasure in our art and pursue the art, or do we take pleasure in selling our art in pursuing that?""<p>It's painfully obvious that good businesses pay people to create a positive value proposition for them.  Therefore, if you are running your career like a business, you need to be seeking to maximize your value proposition. Part of that is passing yourself off as a maximal value creator.  That is one half of the essence of patio11's point.<p>A lot of the artists I've dealt with are content to seek their art and to work in badly paid jobs to maximize their pursuit of their art. As someone who can program computers, we can draw value from our art. We do not <i>need</i> to hack at night and work as a barista during the day. That is the other half of the essence of patio11's point.<p>No one has to take patio11's advice, and their priorities may not align with his priorities.<p>But if you're maximizing wealth creation through being a programmer, you need to stop 'being a programmer/hacker/ninja/rock star/operator' and start 'being a person who creates wealth for other people via technology'.",1320166486

However, that may not mean the initial URL fetching is usually (or even often) by a Chrome-like process.<p>My guess would be there are a mixture of processes which all collect page captures into a working area. (Which process is used for a particular site/URL might vary over time based on feature-detection  for example an initial old-style survey collection might be followed by a more browser-like collection later. The 'working area' is whatever serves the BigTable role in 2011.) All captures can then be further analyzed (virtually re-crawled from the working area) as necessary, by an even larger collection of analysis processes. That many of these analysis processes  share code with other Google projects is to be expected, but to say that they are actually 'GoogleBot' (once they're not doing the initial fetching) or 'Chrome' (when they're processing bulk working-area data after-the-fact) is likely an oversimplification that obscures more than it is illuminates.<p>The strongest external evidence that Google's main crawling was using a Chrome-like engine would be if the pattern of URL-fetching, as observed in logs, became more like a browser: everything needed to render one page fetched in rapid succession (unless it's already previously cached).

3182869,comment,3181177,3182486,4,0,DanielStraight,,,"""Make people understand what exactly I do"" is exactly the attitude I think Patrick is arguing <i>against</i>. That's why you don't call yourself a programmer or talk about what technologies you use. Because it doesn't matter to non-software companies. What matters is whether you can save the company money or increase their revenue.<p>Calling yourself a programmer is telling what you do. Describing how many hours of work you can save is telling how you can provide value.<p>When presented with a bunch of employees manually copying information from spreadsheet into a database, you can tell them, ""I know Excel interop and SQL,"" or you can tell them, ""I can make it so you never have to manually copy this information again."" Only one of these statements is interesting to a non-programmer. The first implies the second to us, but not to a non-programmer, so you need to be explicit. You can't expect them to make the inference and present you with a spec for a spreadsheet-parsing, database-updating program.<p>The reason programmers have to learn this and not CNC operators is that the benefit of a CNC operator is much better understood in their sphere (manufacturing) than the benefit of a programmer is understood in their sphere (almost anywhere computers are used extensively). Most people who can benefit from a CNC operator know it and know how. Most people (outside of the software industry) who can benefit from a programmer don't know it and even if they did, wouldn't know how.<p>Programming is by no means the only field in which this applies though. It also applies in design, copy-writing, SEO, ergonomics, preventative medicine, and many other fields. Anywhere where the people who can benefit from a field's work don't understand the field's work, but do understand impact to their bottom line.<p>If you pitch a business with, ""I increased productivity at another business by 10%,"" you'll have better results (at least this is the conjecture at hand) than if you pitch with, ""I'm an ergonomics expert,"" even though the actual work being offered is the same. Either way, the business owners will probably never understand that ergonomics is more than adjusting desk height. But they don't, and shouldn't, need to. They just need to appreciate how it helps their bottom line and trust the experts to apply the expertise where it should be applied.<p>Trying to make people understand what you do is exactly the problem. Programmers naturally seem to want people to understand how computers work and what they can do. We want people to understand what code is, why it's important that it's written well, and so many other things that business owners simply shouldn't need to care about. That's why we tell people we're programmers, or that we know certain languages or frameworks. These things are only relevant to other programmers though. Business owners care about making money, so tell them how you can do <i>that</i>.",1320165461

For example, the U.S. Constitution has written into it a prohibition on federal officeholders accepting titles of nobility, no matter how much voters like or dislike the politician in question; they just decided not to leave that question for the voters, but thought it would lead to less corruptible politics if politicians were completely banned from accepting noble titles.

3182814,comment,3181681,3181681,10,0,fleitz,,,"""a realtime system must have a deterministic time to complete a task"".<p>Incorrect, a realtime system must only have execution times below a certain threshold. malloc/free is just as non-deterministic as GC allocated memory (in practical systems). If you put effort into it you can make malloc/free do really stupid things too. If I wrote a program that allocated and freed the right size strings the program would eventually crash.<p>With any sort of modern CPU it would be almost impossible to produce non-trivial programs with deterministic execution times. I'd hazard a guess that there are very few 'realtime' programs that couldn't be written using the JVM. If you can do HFT on the JVM it's realtime enough.<p>To make systems with deterministic execution times you'd have to start looking at extremely limited processors that lack RAM (or have really exotic ram that doesn't refresh), as well as removing other resources that are essential to building software the modern way.<p>All this proves is that for this particular problem the JVM is probably unsuitable for a realtime system. The fortunate thing is that I don't think any real time program actually needs to allocate strings in this manner.<p>In all seriousness most of the reason that the JVM is not used on realtime systems is because there aren't very many cheap CPUs capable of executing java byte code that are certified for operation in the harsh environments that a lot of realtime systems operate in. My friend builds realtime systems and he codes in C because that's the only compiler available for the CPU.<p>He'd start using Netduino in a heartbeat if it could survive being next to an electric generator inside the Hoover dam.",1320164954

Avoiding having to route high-speed DRAM lines on the PCB itself not only saves space but it further reduces memory latency.</i><p>Uh... come again?  DRAM latency is a function of the analog circuit inside the chip, not the wires you connect to it.  At best, you might be able to drive the chips at a higher transfer frequency (but even then, the limit is probably on-package in the DRAM, not due to board trace problems).  But that has at best a minimal effect on latency (you're shrinking the handful of transfer cycles at the end of the read).<p>The advantage of the PoP configuration is <i>precisely</i> that it saves space -- quite a bit of space, and it's a great trick.  But this bit is just way off.",1320164656

What I mean is that a gadget reviewer's experience is so far different from a normal consumer's as to be almost informationless. Gadget reviewers are always looking at new things, never have to use the old things for very long, and their use is probably not representative of most people's use. (For example, when reviewing an Android phone, why does it matter that the UI is different from another Android phone? This only matters for a gadget reviewer who has to switch between phones all the time. Most people will choose a phone and stick with it for at least 2 years. They'll learn to use that UI. They will rarely encounter other UIs.)<p>I think Brian Lam's Wirecutter[0] takes a step in the right direction.

That's the reason why it's difficult to raise your prices. App developers could easily find alternatives to your service quite easily... they can go to myGengo or tens of other services (including the company I work for), and they could probably get it at a cheaper price. When you have a situation like that, then you have no leverage.<p>You need to find your differentiation. For example, a good niche some translation companies we work with specialize in medical translation. You can't easily substitute translators with medical expertise... They have more price leverage than your regular run-of-the-mill translator. I'm not sure what specialties you have in your skillset, but you need to find a niche that you can serve.<p>Another differentiator is speed. The translation industry is changing rapidly. In the past, most translation jobs were completed in the order of months (think documentation for Microsoft). Nowadays, most jobs require translations to be done in less than a few days (think blog posts). Running an efficient and scalable operation is quite difficult.<p>I have much more to say, but I'm at work, so I'll reply later.",1320164044

USPTO doesn't have the authority to unilaterally cease issuing entire classes of patents when Congress and the courts have, so far, directed otherwise; what they can do, however, is seek to improve patent quality & decrease vague patents.  I'm not sure how successful they will be, especially given funding issues, but this stance seems to be about as far as they can go at present. We need change to come from elsewhere, including the law schools (so lawyers get disabused of this notion that software + computer results in a new machine).",1320163213

2413128,comment,2411858,2412164,3,0,antiterra,,,"You might argue that they don't fit your definition of ""good schools,"" but plenty of schools let you skim by with only the lightest introduction into things like set theory, probability, Turing machines, and automata. The math requirements are also pretty shallow, usually only requiring you to take some level of calculus, but not requiring linear algebra or analysis. Theory courses that scratch the surface a bit deeper are often electives. Some schools force you on tracks, but others let you choose and you can basically glue javascript and ruby together for the rest of your degree.<p>The tracks allow a similar siloing. If you take an applications track, it's likely you won't be learning fourier transforms that you'd get in the graphics and vision track. In either of those cases, you may not get the functional programming experience that you would get in the AI or theory tracks. Those two wouldn't require you to take the database courses you'd need for info science.<p>There's only so much that classes can cover in the course of an undergraduate education. Teaching yourself advanced topics is likely essential in taking on a project of a different nature than what you learned in school.",1302043930

2413124,comment,2411348,2412248,2,0,Laments,,,"To add an unrelated reply to a crowded discussion: I think that what we've seen from Googler manager skillset article in the Times is that Google has had to learn basic managerial attributes organically since that's the Google way -- from this outsider's perspective, it almost sounded like if they didn't invent it, it's hard-to-impossible to adopt given the startup culture.<p>I think that this board in particular has given Facebook a lot of praise; by this, I mean that there's a fascination/silent cheering for their engineering-driven culture. But I think that we're seeing a transition by Google from a startup (Facebook) to a real company (Microsoft); as much as a ""management"" layer is derided, a lot of Google's projects seem to have little business value; while they may eventually become valuable, it seems like their strategy has been to shy away from placing limits and directing units towards hard business goals (profitability).<p>But I'd argue that the rise of ""business"" being more important than passion-projects (which is what we implicitly view Google as) has been very visible, just ignored. Android's device manufacturers producing under anti-fragmentation clauses  comes to mind as a sterling example of a unit posing to follow Google's motto but in reality has them running in the opposite direction (e.g. away from openness).<p>So, to round back: sure, anything could happen in regard to managers; but Google's in the middle of growing pains, and those pains I believe will end in an increased managerial presence/layer rather than ignored outright.",1302043819

Well the system needs to change but the problem here is caused by the proliferation of engineering colleges (and other technical degree colleges). Its too easy to start a engineering college in India. There are way too many ""engineers"" and degree holders pushed out that don't deserve to get that degree. The schools only care about getting money and are really shitty. That is what is making for the influx of poor candidates into the employment pool.",1302040989

But a college where every other week there's a test stacked up for the 6 subjects,  syllabi is mixed up the way it should not be, even the last semester has two useless subjects lined up, and attendance is compulsory, it hardly leaves you with much time to answer the ""how""s you've been wondering about.<p>This overburdened-ness hardly leaves students the time to think about what they'd love to do in life & any kind of self-improvement. Tired of such a monotonous routine for 3-4 years the escape route turns into getting a job asap -> hence your observation of ""how little enthusiasm most people have about the work they'd end up doing"" <- for they really never got a time to think & discuss about how they wish to drive their lives.",1302040982

2412926,comment,2411695,2411695,7,0,Stormbringer,,,"To me the most disturbing thing as described in the article is that despite an emphasis on rote learning, they can't even teach how to read.<p>To me it seems that reading and 'thinking' are such fundamental skills in IT that they would just be assumed elsewhere... but an educational system that fails to teach reading is really enormously broken.<p>That said, I have actually worked with two lots of people in Bangalore.  One lot got flown out to my country, and they were nice if a little lazy.  On the other hand, they put up with some shit that the 'white natives' wouldn't have, like ridiculously long compile times because some idiot (most likely a well educated white person) had thrown the kitchen sink at their ant script.  <i>I</i> wouldn't have put up with a 30 minute build, I'd have lost my nut.  They were at least as smart as the 'white natives', they could converse, their English was at least as good (and better in some cases) than the native English speakers.<p>However, they said that in Bangalore working for companies is very stratified.  Everyone wants to work at the large American companies (e.g. IBM) so they are the top tier and get to pick the best candidates, and then you get this trickle down effect, till you get to relatively small non-US foreign companies (like us).  From the article, it seems there are even lower tiers, e.g. presumably the good candidates don't apply to the smaller Indian companies.<p>Funnily enough, later on I got the opportunity to work with some guys in Bangalore who were employed by IBM, and they were completely, atrociously bad.  The only time I've seen worse is deliberate sabotage.  These guys got on the excuse merry-go-round and never got off, and would keep recycling excuses why they hadn't done any work, even though you'd think ""didn't we already deal with this the previous two times it came up?"".  These guys did nothing.<p>Naturally, I cheated.  :D  I took a page out of the  managers handbook, declared 'victory' and ended the programming phase.  Now we were into the testing/bugfix phase.  My 'white native†' colleagues who had also been frustrated by lack of progress in Bangalore were puzzled by this.  They said how can it go into testing, they haven't done anything?  So I said ""run the tests and if you find any problems, fix them"" so they said ""but there's nothing to run!"" and I said ""well, that is the first problem to fix then isn't it?"".  And suddenly the lightbulb went on and they 'got it'.  We actually made up all the lost time and then some.<p>So I'm not particularly impressed with these so called 'top tier' candidates either.<p>†Not necessarily white or 'native', but naturalised citizens of an English speaking country",1302040873

That is, they will attend to the needs of the team, make sure people don't leave, and make sure they attract more people when they need them.<p>In other words, HR. The central HR department at Google has no reason to really care about the success of your unit over another, so your manager becomes the person who takes responsibility for the human resources of the unit.<p>This frees the engineers/designers to be able to focus on creating a great product. And as a side benefit, they happier and their jobs are easier because the manager is doing what it takes to keep them in the unit.",1302040817

6565337,comment,6565038,6565038,9,0,acheron,,,"Much of the so-called &quot;gerrymandering&quot; is required by the VRA, which this proposal would certainly violate. <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/10/15/how_mich_rebuts_redistrictingpolarization_claims_120323.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/10/15/how_mic...</a><p><i>This looks like a terrible gerrymander. But there is actually something of a method to this madness. The GOP actually didnt have much choice but to pack voters into Detroit- and Flint-based districts. Detroit has had two African-American-majority districts since the 1960s, and Republicans were probably required under the Voting Rights Act to retain both of them.<p>This was no easy task. The 13th and 14th districts had both seen their African-American populations drop below 60 percent, and both had suffered severe population losses in the 2000s, requiring them to take on quite a few additional citizens. Making matters worse, there were barely enough African-Americans in all of Wayne County to create two African-American-majority districts entirely within that countys borders.<p>Since it was impossible (and possibly unconstitutional) to draw lines to make sure every African-American in the county was in the minority-majority district, redistricters needed to add those voters from Oakland County, which has a growing African-American population. This is actually the source of the odd appendage we see jutting northward from Detroit; it crosses Oakland County to take in heavily minority Pontiac. Even with all this, both districts are only 56 percent African-American and the 14th still elected a white Democrat over an African-American incumbent in the 2012 primaries.<p>The neighboring districts were then all pushed toward Republicans, as the most loyal Democratic constituents were removed to comply with the VRA. Even a Democratic legislature would have drawn something akin to these districts; there just arent many other options. No neighboring district is left with an African-American population in excess of 11 percent under this map, suggesting that the heavily African-American precincts in the state were pretty well gobbled up.</i>",1382018269

I did some development to port an AIR/AS application written on OSX to Windows.

MS and Apple will get there in some form, but I suspect their visions of convergence will be somewhat more restrictive in terms of what I can do.<p>Whether or not they need Mir for that vision, I&#x27;ve no idea. However, I remember people talking about X11 replacements clear back in the long ago, and being disappointed for years. Canonical seems pretty close to delivering something that they say will enable them to do something that I think will be cool. And, I believe they&#x27;ve said it will be open source.

Therefore, if we could create a near-frictionless method of automatically calling our friends to remind them to leave early, maybe we could improve their reliability. The calendar seemed like a natural place to  do this - Just invite a ringreminder.com email address to the calendar entry, and a telephone call reminder is set. Also, us organized folks already used our calendar apps to keep track of when we were meeting said friends.<p>On the back end, its built in Java (spring framework) - we basically poll a mail account at regular intervals checking for calendar invites (Google/iCal or Outlook format) - we then parse out the necessary information to schedule the reminder call from the invite, and call Twilio to make the outgoing call. Any changes to the event (including cancellation) are automatically processed, assuming that you let your calendar app notify all guests to the event of the change. There is also a web CRUD interface for manually managing reminders.<p>Let me know if you have any questions!",1382016895

That&#x27;s fine, but I don&#x27;t see that it makes sense to switch distribution because you don&#x27;t like the defaults, given that all the other options are available inside Debian and/or Ubuntu as well. There&#x27;s Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu GNOME, Kubuntu etc. all of which have different desktop environment defaults, enthusiastic developers who look after it. Some intend to switch to Mir, and some do not. Switching distribution because you don&#x27;t like the main Ubuntu flavour&#x27;s defaults is just fragmentation when there&#x27;s no need for it. There may be plenty of valid reasons, but not liking the defaults is not one of them.<p>> Millions is spent on Ubuntu but seems like little makes it upstream.<p>I don&#x27;t think you appreciate how much work does go upstream.

Driver work for new hardware enablements go to the upstream kernel so that Ubuntu developers don&#x27;t have to maintain it. And Canonical <i>is</i> upstream for a number of projects (eg. they pioneered faster boot speeds with upstart, which went into RHEL). You just don&#x27;t see this in action because the community works, and work done in one distribution ends up in all the others.

6565151,story,,,1,1,kitcar,"Show HN: Schedule phone call reminders from within your favorite calendar app -",http://www.ringreminder.com,"Some friends and I built RingReminder over a few nights / weekends as a side project - the core problem we were trying to solve was &quot;how can we improve the reliability of our friends/family, so they do the things they are supposed to?&quot;, like show up to social plans on time, take their medications, etc...<p>The solution we landed on was a telephone-based automated reminder service - controlled from your calendar app.<p>The hypothesis driving our solution was while many people may check their email every few seconds / view upcoming events in their calendars, everyone we know picks up calls to their phones. Therefore, if we could create a near-frictionless method of automatically calling our friends to remind them to leave early, maybe we could improve their reliability. The calendar seemed like a natural place to  do this - Just invite a ringreminder.com email address to the calendar entry, and a telephone call reminder is set. Also, us organized folks already used our calendar apps to keep track of when we were meeting said friends.<p>On the back end, its built in Java (spring framework) - we basically poll a mail account at regular intervals checking for calendar invites (Google/iCal or Outlook format) - we then parse out the necessary information to schedule the reminder call from the invite, and call Twilio to make the outgoing call. Any changes to the event (including cancellation) are automatically processed, assuming that you let your calendar app notify all guests to the event of the change. There is also a web CRUD interface for manually managing reminders.<p>Let me know if you have any questions!",1382016310

Now you have an idle developer and an overloaded developer holding the process up. If you have a process whereby the idle developer can&#x27;t share some of the workload of the other you are going to have very inefficient development.<p>You also run into problems if one developer is on holiday , off sick or leaves the company since nobody else has ever looked at their code.<p>There&#x27;s also a risk of bringing politics into re-factoring decisions. &quot;This functionality should be part of your API&quot;.",1382016306

Oracle is embracing and offering open source solutions as a viable way to complete simple software projects and as an adjunct to the development and deployment of more complex projects that are based on commercial software.<p>- Open source for tiny projects. Oracle for the real work. Got it.<p>2. Another key issue facing government acquisition executives is the issue of indemnification. When a software company provides a product to its customers, it is expected to stand by its product, and is legally required to do so. In the case of open source, there are remarkably few companies willing or able to offer indemnification for their products.<p>- There are several open source companies, which stand by their &quot;products&quot;, and offer support contracts.<p>3. Load testing, system performance tuning, and system optimization are also expensive tasks. Commercial software companies have developed highly refined methodologies to 
perform these tasks.<p>- I&#x27;ve worked some with Oracle databases. Most organizations are paying through the nose for little benefit; management loves whitepapers like this.<p>4. Oracle licenses commercial software to fill the gaps where open source does not fully address enterprise capability requirements. Automated Deployment & Provisioning ...Extreme Performance, High Availability, & Scalability<p>- Ok.<p>5. If you are concerned with vendor lock-in, and you see open source solutions as a means of owning the code you want to run, a quick glance at the Open Source Initiative (OSI) can be daunting. Nearly 100 licensing regimes have gone through the license approval process. Open source is not free, nor is it easy to understand the strict legal terms and conditions associated with its use.<p>- I&#x27;ve found the popular OSS licenses quite simple to understand and there are excellent explanations available; Most Open Source apps use one of these, though there might be 100 which are OSI approved.<p>6.

6565053,comment,6560214,6564929,3,0,pron,,,"> Does there need to be a handw-written integration to every kind of blocking resource, or is there magic happening here?<p>Yes (to handwritten integration), but it&#x27;s incredibly simple. We can transform any callback-based API to a fiber-blocking API within hours of work.<p>> What happens if a thread loads from a MappedByteBuffer, and the OS needs to read from disk to satisfy the load? What happens if a thread loads from some far corner of main memory that has been paged out, and the OS needs to read from disk to satisfy the load?<p>The thread will be blocked, but it isn&#x27;t likely to be much of a problem. It&#x27;s perfectly OK for the fiber to block the thread occasionally (hopefully rarely)  the work-stealing scheduler can deal with that because it runs in a thread-pool; if one thread blocks other will steal its work and do it. It&#x27;s just not OK for fibers to block their thread very often. The scenarios you&#x27;ve described involve missed caches and so are rare by design.<p>> Those situations go beyond the power of lightweight threading systems i have seen before. They&#x27;re not fatal problems, nor even serious ones for most programs, but they&#x27;re part of the reason that lightweight threading hasn&#x27;t, and can&#x27;t, become the general solution to threading.<p>I agree. Quasar fibers are by no means meant to serve as a replacement for threads. They are specifically targeted for cases when you want lots of concurrent &quot;threads&quot; that interact very often by passing information (either via messages or a shared data structures), and so block and wait for each other a lot.<p>If you have a long-running computation: use a plain thread.<p>Actually, one of the cool things in Quasar is an abstraction called a strand. A strand is simply either a thread or a fiber. All of the synchronization mechanisms (channels, condition variables etc.) provided by Quasar work with strands - not directly with fibers - 
so you can use them both in fibers or threads. In fact, you can run a Quasar actor in a thread rather than a fiber.",1382015192

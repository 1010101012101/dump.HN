I was skeptical at first, as I find books like this pretty shallow  (like Freakonomics),  but this one is actually good, and backed by real data in many of his points.  Especially the hockey players one.  The data is right there, the elephant in  the room nobody really noticed it.<p>I have had this saying: You like what are you good at, and you become good at what you like.<p>When you start an activity/sport or something like chess at an early age, the differences between you and other kids are minor, and if you have even a small 2%-5% edge, you end up winning.  And you endup liking it, and work/study/practice harder on that, and you end up really good at it later on, and your performance will be a magnitude better from those kids that were only little bit behind you.<p>And in sports the day you were born is very important.  I guess the school you go (elementary/middle school) is very important too.",1237351816

521206,story,,,6,3,jackelpdw,"Cell phone wardriving/hacking?",,"So this morning at around 2:30am I was driving back home for my lunch break, and was pulling off Augusta's ring road when I ended up behind a blue sedan with Washington(state) plates. It was moving fairly slow considering there was zero traffic and it was 2:30 in the morning. As I inevitably got right behind it, I noticed that there were six identical cell phones tied to the driver's side head rest, one on either side and 4 along the back, all facing outwards. The rack was connected to a wire that ran out of the car to an ipod-sized antenna on the roof. One after the other each cell phone would dial a random number and then hold the call for about 40 seconds before dropping it and going black for a few seconds. Call, hangup, black, call, hangup, black...repeat. It was rather eerie to watch, and the passenger sitting in the back behind the passenger-side seat seemed to look up and back down every once in a while like he was either controlling them or recording what was going on with them. I was behind them for about 6 minutes before I reached my apartment complex and turned off the road. Has anyone ever seen or heard of anything like this? It just seemed extremely weird and I still haven't come up with any sort of explanation for it that doesn't sound whack.",1237351146

521199,comment,519554,519554,0,0,oomkiller,,,"I think this article is close, but misses an important player, SSDs.  SSDs bring super-fast data rates that can be amplified by traditional techniques (striping etc), but work enough like disk systems so that applications don't have to be rewritten.  I believe that we will see SSD speeds continue to increase, along with widespread adoption and price reduction.  On the software side, I believe that many commonly used applications will begin to detect SSDs and (un)optimize their code for them.  In my opinion, memory will always be the fastest, but SSD gives the reliability and backwards computability that will cause mass-adoption.<p>I think we'll see (and have already seen) the early-adopters and power users start adopting SSDs at a high rate.  Business adoption usually follows after a few years.  So my prediction is that we'll see 1TB or larger sized SSDs, that are increasingly faster, within a few years.  I think we'll start seeing DB arrays with multiple SSDs in a Raid0+1 or similar, probably up to 10TB or larger.<p>Does anyone else feel this way.",1237350646

The business peaked in 2006 and revenues fell for two years running - so it started declining before the owner fell ill.<p>It looks like it is recovering in the first two months of 2009, but it could also be a spike.<p>It also looks like it needs a fair amount of work to make that much money. So you pay somewhere between $120,000 and $160,000, give up your current job, take the risks entailed, work hard and you might make $100,000+ a year in revenues (not profits!). That does not sound like such a good deal.<p>In general, the difficulty of verifying the profitability of small sites means that no one will risk paying a high multiple for them. No one with a decent site will sell it at a low multiple, so if it is for sale, expect it to have poor prospects.",1237349254

521153,comment,520189,520883,0,0,icefox,,,"Yah and that ""handful"" happens to be the hand picked team that used to be the Google Firefox development team.  Not exactly a random group of developers hacking on their free time.  These guys have been doing Browser work for a long time and knew exactly what they were getting into.<p>Chrome is a project that is over two and a half years old.  Not many would say that is an ""incredibly short period of time"".  It is going to take another year before Linux/OS X support is stable.  That is more then three years.  Take a look at the Linux code.  They are reworking strings, keyboard events, clipboard, window management, pretty much everything.  It is like starting work on a whole new application.  There is a reason why so many people buy Qt licenses (or use the lgpl version these days), cross platform isn't exactly easy.<p>From conversations I have had with hackers:<p>- Google acts like they are all Linux developers, but at least the Chrome team used Visual Studio and use Windows primarily.  They don't seem to care about my platform so why should I care about their app?<p>- Google ports webkit to Android and then separately to Chrome, clearly they have extra resources to burn, but not for a Linux/OS X port so it must be <i>really</i> low on their list.<p>- Internally all the Linux Google devs knew about Chrome for two years, but didn't bother to help in their 20% free time.  Not even to help make it <i>compile</i>.  If all of them didn't find Chrome worth their time (and they are all really smart guys) they must know something.<p>- Apple, the company that locks you down to their platform more then Microsoft has a cross platform browser!  Opera and Firefox are on all three.  Even the little Arora browser is cross platform.  A new browser that wants to be big cannot have cross platform be an afterthought as it clearly was with Chrome.<p>Chrome is cool yes, I have hacked on the code and even submitted patches to help get it compiling on Linux.  It has a lot of nice things going for it design wise and it will do ok in the long run, but as it is today sitting only on Windows it is very hard to attract the early adopters, the ones who buy every new geek toy and tells all their friends about it.  Once it can get past this hump it will do ok.  The marketing seems to indicate that this early adopter group the very group they are trying to attract and yet the product as it is today is really for mainstream joe average users.  It really is no surprise when the early adopter group trashes a product that isn't useable for them.  HackerNews isn't exactly known for being a Windows hangout.<p>There is a lot to cleanup in the Chrome source and I wouldn't be surprised if the next twelve months (minimum) was spent cleaning up all the windows specific code before they can really start on new and innovative features.  They decided their technical debt would be Windows during initial development and now they are paying it.  But they are a good team with smart developers.  Or as I heard from someone else: Chrome is a snowball at the top of a hill.  It might be not much now, but with google's cash behind it Chrome will keep on rolling down the hill and getting bigger and eventually you will have to deal with it.",1237349151

We just like talking with smart people. The only thing I downvote people for constantly are the people who talk about getting downvoted (but you replied to me, so you're safe there).<p>Evil has more implications than the dictionary definitions. The dictionary defines ""sacred"" as ""connected with God (or the gods) or dedicated to a religious purpose and so deserving veneration"" but there's meaning lost in such a bland definition. Similarly, evil means more than ""not good"".<p><i>It isn't all abuse? Oh, well, fine, I'm so glad that is cleared up because some sick fuck says that ""its not all abuse"". I can't wait for my kids to hear ""Not all methamphetamine will cause you harm"" from a speed freak. That logic makes infinite sense.</i><p>I love people who put words in my mouth. I suggested that life is complicated - that, say, a speed freak isn't an inherently bad person even if he's addicted to something that's very bad, and that I dislike people who look at something and call it Evil dwelling in man's heart.<p>There's a whole argument about the nature of ""evil"" and ""profane"" in religion studies, where the argument goes that evil or profane things refer to things that are naturally inhuman (or lacking the empathy with God or other human beings that humanity seems to be defined by). Essentially, when you call something ""evil"" the implication is that it is without ration or excuse and that it is something that a ""good"" human is inherently incapable of doing. Big-E Evil in  particular goes by those rules.<p>I believe that the world and human nature is too complex to quickly call evil. It's why I hate that a post like this, long and complex and fascinating, gets called ""Evil"" in a single-sentence condemnation. It's almost certainly horrible. I think the entire trade is sickening. But I'll give it some level of respect, because these are human beings we're talking about, and because no human being deserves to be judged with a single sentence, especially not when he makes the effort to explain himself in a more complex way.<p><i>Whether you like it or not, Evil most certainly exists in this world, regardless of whether or not there is a reason that it came in to existence.</i><p>The idea of Evil suggests that there's no reason to evil, that it's original sin and that we are inherently flawed. That follows the ration that there's a such thing as inherent good. I subscribe instead to the belief that good and evil are both a part of human logic, and that the really awful thing is that evil is a part of nature (and not just human nature). As a result, I dislike the people who would assume that evil is an illogical, spontaneous thing, and I think that the best way to combat evil is to give it as much respect as possible. If you reject it outright, you're no better in a way, because you offer it no comprehension.",1237349057

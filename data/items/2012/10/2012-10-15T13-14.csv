You made all the fallacious claims I pointed out.<p>As for evolution, no you did not evolve to do anything.  Evolution is a process, it does not have goals.  It is not aiming to get somewhere, or accomplish something.  Which is why claiming you ""evolved to eat X"" is nonsense.  Your ancestors evolved the ability to gain nutrition from X, that doesn't mean X is good for you.  It means in prehistoric times, the short term gain from being able to gain nutrition from X was greater than any downsides to it (it could cause cancer 100% guaranteed, but if it lets you survive in the short term long enough to reproduce and rear offspring, it will still end up selected for).",1350309499

I do have my eyes on the prize (which would be working in a faced paced and supportive environment) but I'm still building my skill set.

From Theodosius I declaring Christianity mandatory and destroying the pagan temples, to Icelanders being held hostage to put pressure on them to convert (which they eventually voted to do, under that pressure), to colonial militias spreading Christianity in Africa and Asia, the religion basically spread by the sword. And it was maintained for hundreds of years thereafter through state violence: in most of Europe, if you attempted to convert to another religion, or declare yourself an atheist, you'd be executed as an apostate or a heretic.

Ideas do not exist in a vacuum, they exist among all other ideas and opinions and among data and personal anecdote and so on.<p>Without critique, ideas fail.<p>Edit: If you think someone is wrong, you should tell them (if you can articulate it in a well-reasoned, well-supported manner). Controversial ideas <i>especially</i> shouldn't get a free pass from critique just because they're on the dubside of mainstream thought. How does that even make any sense? Mainstream ideas are, by definition, more popular. While this popularity could lead to less (direct) critique, it still leads to more people thinking about the idea, refining it, etc. There's more brainpower behind a mainstream idea than behind a controversial one. All ideas are deserving of critique, but the ones that have been built with less human hours should probably be looked at a little more closely.",1350307147

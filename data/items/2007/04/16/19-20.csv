13373,comment,6302,6702,0,0,Harj,,,"No.  Only the second part of my statement ""best startups will be formed"" can be labeled as an assertion of my opinion.<p>The first part is fact.  SV has produced more great startups than any other area in the world.  Arguing with that fact is futile.<p>It's not just VC that SV has as an advantage.  Its a high density of angel investors and young people wiling to take a risk and launch startups.<p>As for the assumption of taking venture capital not holding any longer, venture capital in the narrow sense i.e. VC firms - possibly but in the general sense of needing to raise investment at some point, name me a successful startup that hasn't.",1176753536

13371,comment,13218,13304,0,0,jey,,,"I agree, up to the last part that ""at the same time reducing the amount of actual work they are able to do on a day to day basis"". It is well known that time is not directly proportional to productivity. It's more like  time x skill = productivity. So the most productive people probably work fewer hours, but are more productive than the average person working 8 hours a day.

13369,comment,13260,13260,0,0,Tichy,,,"What does he mean by burning ships, though? Quitting your day job? Or quitting your day job and doing something so outrageous to make sure you will never ever get employed again (can't even imagine what that would be)? The latter would be kind of stupid, but quitting your day job doesn't seem so bad. Don't they say that younger people can afford to take more risks in their investments, because if they fail, they have enough time to make up for it? That seems sensible to me - I think it is far more dangerous to not take any risks and then regret it later when it is (seemingly) too late, like when you have a family support. <p>So no, I don't think I agree with that article at all.\n",1176752772
13368,comment,13312,13367,0,0,blader,,,"I think what Daniel is saying is that on social news sites, popular posts tend be popular because they're popular.<p>I don't think we can attribute Google's success to cumulative effects:<p>I suspect that you can see cumulative advantage effects only when objective quality is difficult or impossible to measure. Taste in music is extremely subjective - it's very difficult to measure the quality of music independent of its popularity. <p>On the other hand, the objective quality of search results can be measured by independent testing and feedback - it's not perfect - but you can get a much better measurement of quality for search than you can for music.",1176752681
13367,comment,13312,13350,0,0,Benja,,,"Your point is that news.yc and other social news sites are actually <i>more useful</i> when more people use them, right? I agree with that. But IMHO, that's missing the point of the article.<p>Music doesn't <i>objectively</i> get better just because more people listen to it; and yet, the authors' research appears to show that people's opinions of music is hugely influenced by what other people like. Recall their main result: They had one group of users who they didn't show any information about how often a song was downloaded, and then eight independent groups who were shown the download count of each song inside that group. ""The song 'Lockdown,' by 52metro, for example, ranked 26th out of 48 in [the group not shown download counts]; yet it was the No. 1 song in one social-influence world, and 40th in another. Overall, a song in the Top 5 in [the group not shown counts] had only a 50 percent chance of finishing in the Top 5 of success."" Their conclusion is that the reason why predicting the success of media products is shaky is that what's a success is hugely influenced by an unpredictable feedback process.<p>Thus, my question: Can we assume that Google's success is due in a large part not to anything that Google did, but to the (random) feedback process of people liking Google because they see other people liking Google?<p>Of course, one could argue that this is simply the truism that one needs luck as well as talent to succeed. But I come away from reading the article with the feeling that I've learned something that goes deeper than that, and I'm trying to figure out how to apply it to the tech world.",1176752182

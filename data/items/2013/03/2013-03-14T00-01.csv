5372405,comment,5371253,5371253,46,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is accurate. Being poor is expensive (paradoxically?) in a lot of ways. One of them is the amount of attention that you have to give to stupid details, and the amount of stuff you end up lugging around. It clutters your life to be poor.<p>That NYT article was just douche-tastic. As someone who genuinely detests consumerism, I can't tolerate that whole ""I'm rich and enlightened so I've given up stuff"" braggadocio. That <i>is</i> consumerism. Only an idiot wouldn't see that. (Of course, there are genuine minimalists out there and I have no problem with that.)<p>I also hate the people who think <i>travel</i> makes them more interesting and virtuous. Most people, most cases? No, not at all. You might become more interesting if you spend a month in an Indian monastery, or building schools in Africa. However, going to clubs and getting drunk doesn't count. You can do that here. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's recreation, not automatically a promotion of the spirit.",1363222796

5372355,comment,5369778,5369778,4,0,mbubb,,,"Fascinating. The discussion as well. Surprised at how few comments there were about the culture of eating.<p>Part of the reason Soylent makes sense is that we are already eating 'food-like substances' (to paraphrase Michael Pollen) much of the time. 
He is just doing it in a controlled instrumental way.<p>When I go to the datacenter (5 miles from the Lincoln tunnel in the godforsaken New Jersey Meadowlands). I generally pack the same food. kefir, beef jerky and an almond cranberry mix. Purely functional food so I can stay there and concentrate. Is it balanced and nutritional? probably not really.<p>I am American and the soylent thing feels very American to me.  Which is not a bad thing.  I love food and good eating but when I compare my relationship with food and eating with my wife's it is totally different. I was raised on frozen stringbeans with a sauce made of canned mushroom soup next to pot roast cooked to medium well...<p>My wife is Korean and food is totally different - more like what I would associate with someone from Italy or the south of France, etc. Ingredients and process. Her kimchi or the way she cooks rice (6 kinds of grains) - the innumerable side dishes all complementing one another, table grilled meat. Friends, wine. Strong coffee afterwards.<p>I could not imagine life without that - even though much of the preparation is time consuming. When she roasts seaweed over an open fire it takes hours. My boys seem to eat it in minutes...<p>Homemade dumplings involves the whole family and flour all over the place and a few hours of work to make about a gross of dumplings...<p>All of that is not something I would like to replace.<p>However - how often do you have a meal like that? 10 - 20 times a year.<p>What happens the rest of the time? There is an element of drudgery to daily eating. I use a hand grinder and a moka stovetop pot for my coffee. A pain in the ass - but I am addicted to the result.<p>Maybe a routine where you ate soylent for the instrumental times and had festive meals when desired (or when you really craved something).",1363222114

Okay, in this case one could (convincingly) argue that advertisers are the real customers of Google Reader, but I would have gladly just paid for the service. Apple is another such company for me, and I dumped considerable amounts of money into them, and they similarly just let me know with every single action that I'm not their kind of customer.<p>So the question becomes not ""why is everyone using them?"" or even ""why are they doing things like this?"", it starts with people like me who got to ask themselves honestly ""why do I keep relying on these guys?"".<p>Gmail is my main email account and it makes me deeply uncomfortable. I love OS X, despite its ever-increasing flaws, and that makes me feel like a hostage experiencing Stockholm syndrome. Facebook is the only thing in this category I actually stopped caring about on my own, but if I'm being honest that's more my friends' fault for re-enacting soap opera scripts online and offline, and less because Facebook is a data-grabbing virus that screws its users over at every turn (which it is).<p>My only face-saving answer to that conundrum is those products offer me some things that others don't, they have features that large companies are better positioned to deliver on. However, that's not a permanent state of things, as the complex features of yesterday become increasingly more feasible for smaller developers to tackle tomorrow. Maybe it's a good thing that Google and others are finally straight-up bent on filtering nerds like me out of their customer base, maybe that's the kick needed to overcome inertia and complacency.",1363221868

Generally speaking, you'd need to create at least two pressure vessels (main cabin, and cockpit), which would have to be joined by a hermetically sealed passage.<p>Between the inner pod, and the outer skin, you'd need to make sure that doors would work in almost any condition. Sure, you can blow the bolts holding the tail on and use parachutes to make the pod descend, though without the pilots since they're in a separate pressure vessel. But what if there's a fire when the plane is on the ground? Parachutes won't work in that situation, and neither would ejection rockets (unless you want to crush the passenger's spines by launching a multi-ton pod high enough for parachutes to deploy).<p>The main problem facing airlines is simple. How to pack in as many people as possible onto a flight in order to cover it's costs (airport fees, fuel, food, wages, etc.). More people who can cover the flight's costs means more profit for the airline, or lower costs for the passengers.<p>The real question with the Pod idea is this. Either way people have to board through a door and go to their seats, so that remains the same. But consider this, would people have to board a pod immediately at the gate, or would they wait in a lounge until the plane arrives? Because if they board the pod immediately, it may save time, but passengers will be sitting in cramped seats, with only airline food, and the limited toilet facilities available for possibly HOURS (if the plane is delayed or the flight cancelled in the end. Since these passengers are not physically ON the plane, the passengers' rights would be questionable in these situations.<p>Technically you could also fill out a pod and have it wait in a holding area on the airport tarmac while the plane arrives, freeing up gates for other airlines. But this impacts the airport retail system (restaurants & stores), which all pay rent to airports. If you eliminate passengers waiting in gates, you eliminate the need for retail. You eliminate retail, you make it that airports would increase fees for airline operations at the airport. And in the end, it would impact ticket prices negatively.",1363221215

Why Google would want to abandon this extremely rich source of behavorial data and trend emergence is beyond me; it suggests a loss of direction, for which short-term reactivity is no substitute. Put another way, you can't lead the herd by following it faster. I am shocked.<p>As I say, I've used Newsblur before and thought it OK - at the time I just somewhat preferred Reader's cosmetics. So the above is not just a reaction to the necessity to switch platforms.",1363219910

I bet if they didn't update their satellite images and road data, Maps usage would decline as well.<p>They could have been working with the community to define new standards - tags, markup, etc - to allow richer interaction between rss readers and sites (thinking geoloc micro format work, and other semantic markup work in recent years).

Maybe even find someone else to bring on that can contribute equal to the cuts I make. But I'm worried that it would damage our relationship to a point of no coming back.<p>I feel like this startup is my best chance for making it, and I absolutely refuse to let it go in order to move on. So the question is, do I just deal with the resentment and be grateful for what I have, make some sort of monetary change, or fire them all together and rebuild the team?<p>Surely this resentment will boil into something even more negative, and I want to act before it gets to that point.",1363219254

We honestly feel like there is a lot of surface left uncovered when it comes to personalized/streamlined content and it just doesn't seem to be part of Google's refocusing (this has been seen with the shutting down of a lot of their lab projects as well).",1363219230

Currently, GPUs can still mine their share (but running a GPU miner on a botnet is a risk; computers become very noisy, hot and slow, which increases the detection rate).

Might be very basic, and perhaps I should understand this already, but...<p>How is it possible for the <i>""value</i> of all the bitcoins in the world"" to be anything, in truth?<p>I understand that this comes from saying ""1 BTC is selling on average for $X USD, and there are X Bitcoins in circulation, therefore the total market size is $1BN""<p>But... knowing that they are not underwritten or backed, surely they're only ""worth"" what somebody will pay for them. Nobody would pay $1BN for all of them, because that would render them all worthless.<p>Even if 10% of them were sold in one day, surely the value would drop precipitously, therefore slashing the total ""value"" of all the bitcoins to maybe half or a tenth of its current estimation.<p>So I ask again, how can the ""value of all the bitcoins in the world"" be any figure, let alone $1BN?",1365001091

The way that the money supply grows, in the bitcoin system, is by people harnessing the power of hundreds or thousands of computers to solve very complicated mathematical tasks, earning bitcoins for doing so along the way. And the easiest and cheapest way of doing that is to do so illegally, by stealth: set up a botnet of hacked computers to do your bidding for you. The incentives, here, are very bad indeed.<p>I'm not an expert, but I thought that these days you basically need specialized hardware/GPUs and a traditional botnet isn't going to get you that far.

Also like current money BTC would be anonymous with the exception that the transactions chain permit governments to see all transactions that happened (since this is necessary by the currency), coupled with double book accounting for businesses this would for me create a very different world than what people believe bitcoin will lead.<p>EDIT: I do not see how political beliefs are at all important if you use/mine a cryptocurrency or not, really the political aspect of bitcoin users gets me baffled, although I see how it developed the impetus for the currency initial diffusion.",1364999583

They pay their employees so little that many live below the poverty line, a situation that forces them to forgo health insurance.

From a technological standpoint it's very cool, but I was wondering what value it adds for the business and customer satisfaction?<p>If I understand your product correctly, 3D may bog down your customer service channels because people will pay more attention to the accuracy of your model (when it may not matter) instead of the metrics you are trying to convey.<p>There are also some logistic issues that I'm wondering how you will overcome:<p>-If I'm a local technician, this will be a great tool to spot check the receiver locations. But I have no way to (accurately and easily) measure if it's 4 feet or 6 feet off the ground.<p>-If I'm a school admin, I need a quick graphic where the only change is the metrics I'm trying to analyze. Making me zoom/move around to see different classrooms / buildings on campus is time I probably don't have. Even pre-made locked 3D views distract me with extra information about the building when I'm really trying assess classroom attendance. And while showing the flow of students from classroom to classroom in 3D would be cool, it would again be much more useful as an analytical tool in 2D where the information being displayed is limited and focused on the task at hand.<p>3D is typically used to engage someone emotionally or show a highly detailed item. Emotionally, it allows us to connect to  an event (such as the SailBoat Race) by filling our eyes with information that can only be gleaned at that time/space in reality. Analytically, it is a great tool to convey and compare important minute details, such as light coming into a room or organs wrapping around each other.<p>It's a great tool when used appropriately and I do see some value added by making an admin see/feel the cramped musky hallways of a building to explain emotionally why students go to class less often in certain buildings. But I equally wonder if you won't find yourself in uphill battle as people focus more on the problems with your model instead of the problems with their attendance?<p>On top of all that, what happens if:<p>-I have a Netbook/Chromebook with too little horsepower for 3D?<p>-I have to install flash just to use your product and can't (Mac)?<p>-My internet connection is slow, intermittent or a combo?",1364998921

Therefore, secondary memory must result from some actual alterations of the synapses, either physical or chemical.  Textbook of Medical Physiology by Arthur C. Guyton (W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1986), page 658.

    Procedural and declarative memories differ dramatically. They use a different logic (unconscious vs. conscious recall) and they are stored in different areas of the brain. Nevertheless, these two disparate memory processes share several molecular steps and an overall molecular logic. Both are created in at least two stages: one that does not require the synthesis of new proteins and one that does. In both, short-term memory involves covalent modification of preexisting proteins and changes in the strength of preexisting synaptic connections, whereas long-term memory requires the synthesis of new proteins and the growth of new connections. Moreover, both forms of memory use PKA, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), CREB-1, and CREB-2 signaling pathways to convert short-term to long-term memory. Finally, both forms appear to use morphological changes at synapses to stabilize long-term memory.  Synapses and Memory Storage by Mayford M, Siegelbaum SA, and Kandel ER.

If you think you can, then please argue how you can retrive information from a completely decomposed brain.

If you agree that the probability is non-zero, then you agree with the cryopreservation advocates. In addition, if you agree that it's non-zero, you must agree that it's better than doing nothing (which clearly has a zero chance of revival).<p>Cryopreservation advocates do not claim that the process is proven to be work, they claim that the chance may be small, but it's non-zero.<p>>""Nature""/""The universe""/""God"" is NOT on our side on this path, so there's no room for optimistic thinking, we can only rely on cold (literally) hard science and math!<p>I don't even know where you're going with this discourse. If you're a utilitarian rationalist you can estimate the chance of success for cryopreservation and revival. It's quite easy to show that if the probability is non-zero, then it's beneficial to make such a bet, as the possible positive utility can be huge if the cryopreservation is succesful.<p>If you think that probability estimates are ""not science"" and therefore ""irrational"", you don't know what you're talking about. If you think that current scientific evidence shows that the chance of revival is zero, then you're clearly wrong (and that would contradict your own claims, as zero chance would mean there's no need to make any new experiments).",1364997691

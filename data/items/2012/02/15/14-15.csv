Lots of people are looking for something just like this.<p>As a user though, you lost me at the first screen.  I run my browser at full screen, so dragging a photo over is a bit of a hassle.  Plus, I'm not ready to trust your app just yet with one of my photos - is my photo being uploaded to your servers?  Is it staying client-side?  I could go looking for a photo that I don't mind uploading but... meh, too much hassle.  Adding a couple of example images would let me play with the app immediately.<p>I like your app philosophy, though.  I look forward to seeing the app evolve.",1329317981

3594413,comment,3593748,3594308,5,0,freehunter,,,"In the Linux world more so than anywhere else, you have an odd and ""at-odds"" mix of users. There exists the ""1993 was a great year for Linux"" crowd, and the ""Linux on the desktop"" crowd. And somehow, you have major overlap between the two. While there are distros and packages contributing to both mindsets (meaning the two can coexist just fine), the biggest problem I see in the Linux world is the users who outright reject experimentation and change.<p>Personally I love where Gnome and KDE (and even Unity) are going. I might not use them daily, I might not find all their features helpful or productive, and I sure as hell am not using them on my server, but there is nothing preventing any Linux user from simply not using the new software. It's easy to find a distro that uses Gnome 2 or KDE 3 or doesn't have PulseAudio. But it's hard to use modern day software without modern day packages or backends. Without this rote experimentation that is at the heart of open source, I wouldn't be using Linux on my desktop. There are a lot of very controversial ideas put forth in the mainstream distros over the years which have contributed more to the adoption of Linux than they've taken away from the traditional users.<p>If someone doesn't like Unity, doesn't like Gnome 3, doesn't like KDE Plasma, doesn't like bleeding-edge distributions... there is a choice. Debian, Slackware, Arch, Gentoo, the list goes on. I don't much like the interface of OSX, but I don't create mailing lists to pooh-pooh it, I simply don't use it. If you have a point, make it.

3594408,comment,3593662,3593662,22,0,dctoedt,,,"Some observations:<p>1.  If the studio had filed a lawsuit, there's a very good chance that, after seeing the Asimov estate's permission, the judge would have quickly tossed the case on summary judgment --- and quite possibly awarded the student his attorneys' fees under section 505 of the Copyright Act,[1] as happened recently in several of the <i>Righthaven</i> copyright-troll cases.[2]<p>2.  A copyright lawyer might have been willing, for little or no money, to explain the facts of life to the studio lawyer on behalf of the student.  The student then might have been able to respond to the studio lawyer (with utmost politeness, of course), ""do what you gotta do.""  He could then have started making his movie and waited to see what the studio did.<p>3.  It's likely that any lawsuit by the studio would have been quickly resolved one way or another, without much in the way of legal expense:<p>  If the student had won quickly on summary judgment, the odds are that his lawyer would have been paid by the judge.<p>  If the student had found he wasn't going to win quickly on summary judgment, <i>then</i> he could have caved to avoid further expense. The odds are that the studio would have gone along --- and might even have been willing to pay the student's legal fees just to get rid of the matter.<p>4.  Either way, both the student and his lawyer would have gotten at least some reputational benefit from the resulting publicity.<p>5.  Heck, they could have proposed settling the case along the lines that Southwest Airline's CEO settled a trademark dispute years ago over the term ""Just Plane Smart"":  Herb Kelleher arm-wrestled the other side's CEO for charity, resulting in good PR for both sides.[3]<p>6.  All this assumes, of course, that the article accurately states all the relevant facts. Lawyers know from hard experience that this always has to be confirmed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/505"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/505</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.copyrighttrademarkmatters.com/2011/11/01/righthaven-loses-another-battle-over-attorneys-fees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyrighttrademarkmatters.com/2011/11/01/righthav...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines#.22Just_Plane_Smart.22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines#.22Just_Plan...</a><p>[Edited for style]",1329317709

Great for taxes too because I always end up having to go back and add it all up myself. I know Mint can do this but I don't need all that bank crawling nonsense, I just wanna forward receipts to an email address (maybe using a Google filter to automate the process), and be able to view the numbers in some concise dashboard.

Yes - they may test if X has worked, and that Y and Z are not present, but if there is no expectation whatsoever that A is present then it won't be something worth testing for normally, even if, in this rather specific example, there's more A than you can point a stick at.<p>Repeatability does not necessarily reflect functional correctness. Clearly this is a bigger issue than just DIYbio, but my point is simply that if you're working in a lab, under lab conditions, you can make a lot more guarantees regarding continuity of environment, materials, and methods than you can in your mum's spare room with over the counter laxative.<p>Equally, however, assuming ""the traditional"" is the only way to go is a dangerous precedent too. I'm just of the possibly naive opinion that it would be difficult to follow the scientific method to as rigorous a standard as is necessary, but perhaps that in itself will precipitate a new industry in low cost biotech equipment.",1329316859

There were no push notifications, etc. The Apple explanation, per Jobs, was that they consciously chose to exclude that capability. A few versions later, voila -- iOS supports multi-tasking.  This sort of cycle -- explain why a feature didn't exist due to some chosen policy/belieft, then include it in later revisions -- became a pattern for Apple.<p>Flip to the hardware side, and the story is different. When has Apple hardware, since Jobs return in the nineties, ever been a compromise? It hasn't, because Jobs focused on the hardware. While the software is important, it is really a means to an end.

Put in basic terms, our reports should not require adjustment when you hand them up the chain of management or to a customer.

Because he was a narcissistic asshole? Really? Because that's the part Isaacson nailed. There are plenty of assholes, and that characteristic alone does not make for a best-selling biography.

Isaacson falls into the same traps that the media does with regularity; thinking Apple's design obsession is about <i>veneer</i>, thinking it's about <i>marketing</i>, about fooling people, about lying. It's not, that might sell a <i>few</i> products, but it does not sell record quantities of products and achieve top customer satisfaction.<p>You'd think a person with full access to Steve Jobs and people close to him would be able to at the very least ask a few questions about what he saw that others could not, that lead to the successes of eg. the iPhone. Recall other industry big wigs laughing it off, from RIM to Nokia to Microsoft. The iPhone was a <i>joke</i> to them. What did Steve see that they did not? What was his thought process? What made Steve Jobs so different for him to be able to upset industry after industry? These are things I'd have wanted to know and I can't help feel a bit sad that now we will never know.

3594236,comment,3593748,3593748,71,0,hp,,,"This article is not well-informed. I worked on or sat next to people who worked on a lot of the stuff mentioned. So you can take me as biased or as having a clue or both as you wish.<p>A general point, the changes described here have been over the course of something like 15 years. So the article seems to be making a ""stuff keeps changing!"" point... but we are talking about over 15 years. Think about changes to hardware, the Internet, etc. over that time. And most indicators are that the Linux desktop has moved much too slowly compared to say Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS.<p>Some examples of errors:<p>""So the Gnome developers wanted to reduce the complexity of their protocol as well and started working on a protocol which was supposed to join the advantages of DCOP and CORBA. The result was called the Desktop Bus (dbus) protocol. Instead of complete remote objects it just offers remote interfaces with functions that can be called.""<p>This is false on several levels. dbus was mostly a kind of cleanup of DCOP for general use, with no intent to ""join the advantages of CORBA"" which were essentially none. I can make no sense of ""instead of objects it offers interfaces"" - it has both objects and interfaces, and pretty much can implement the same kind of API that DCOP does (I believe KDE even did that). Basically this paragraph doesn't mean anything I can relate to the actual technology.<p>""APIs to abstract the uses of OSS, esound and ALSA: gstreamer for Gnome and Phonon for KDE""<p>This is wrong. GStreamer is for making graphs of elements, where elements are decoders, encoders, effects, filters, etc. and can be both audio and video. There is one kind of element (""sound sink"") that does abstract sound output, as you would imagine. There are some other elements that use sound APIs too. But GStreamer is not the same thing as a sound API like ALSA, in any way shape or form. It's for building multimedia _apps_, sort of a media toolkit.<p>Moreover, the main reason to replace the older tech here (OSS, esound) was just that it didn't work very well and didn't support a lot of the things sound cards do. It's not like keeping that old stuff was an option, since it could barely play beeps.<p>""it is no longer possible to run the system without a graphical user interface""<p>I'm just not sure what planet that's on. There sure are a lot of headless Linux servers out there in the world, and it's pretty obvious that the large Linux distributions care about this intensely.<p>Re: NetworkManager, if it's somehow needed when headless and not configurable headless, that would be considered a bug by all involved. Just a matter of tracking down the details and reporting them if they have not been. All the Linuxes aspire to (and in my experience do) support headless operation.<p>""they don't implement the original X11 protocol directly and rely on so-called window manager hints.""<p>This sentence is total word salad. X11 has had window manager hints for two decades. What's new is ""extended window manager hints"" which are some new hints in the same spirit ... in order to do new things. They don't ""wrap"" anything, so ""directly"" is just gibberish. Kind of like how CSS 2.0 isn't the same as CSS 1.0, you know? This complaint is equivalent to bitching because you can't use IE5 on the modern web anymore. The protocols are documented, and you have to use an implementation that implements something from within the last 5 years. The extended window manager hints range from 6 years old to 10 years old, so that's how old a crap we're talking about.<p>An almost exact translation of this claim to the web is: ""they don't implement the original CSS 1.0 directly and rely on so-called CSS 2.0 properties"" ... see how that makes no sense?<p>""Writing X11 programs with xcb and proper RPC APIs like SUNRPC or Thrift should be more than good enough.""<p>This 100% misunderstands why dbus is used. The first goal of dbus is not to send a message from process A to process B; it's to keep track of processes (help A find B, have them each know when the other goes away). The messaging is important but in many ways secondary.<p>Overall, the article doesn't understand the big picture of why all this new stuff was needed. I think there's one big reason: dynamic change. The old ways of doing things almost all involve editing a text file and then restarting all affected applications. But to implement the UIs that people expect (as you'd find on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac), everything has to be ""live""; you change a setting in the dialog, and the whole system immediately picks up on the change. You unplug a cable, everything notices right away. etc. The daemons are because so many pieces of dynamically-updated live state are relevant to more than one process or application. That's why you have a ""swarm of little daemons"" design. And guess what: some other OS's have the same design.<p>That's (at least one of) the major problems being solved. And the author here gives no indication he knows it exists, let alone his proposed alternative approach.<p>I sort of get the inspiration for the article: Linux has been trying to keep up with modern UI expectations without having enough staffing for that really, and certainly regressions have been introduced and there have been bugs and things that could have been better. On the 6-month distribution release cycles, users are going to see some of that stuff. It's software, people. And it's understaffed open source software to boot. So yeah, legitimate frustration, shit changes, sometimes it breaks. I get it.<p>But there's no need to wrap that frustration up in pseudo-knowledge as if it were a technical problem, or say inane things about getting back to the ""unix way""; if someone could show up and make the desktop UI stuff behave well with the ""unix way"" they would have done it. Or maybe they did do it, and the critics understand neither the problem requirements nor the ""unix way."" Just saying.",1329314650

So now if you think you've been wronged not only do you have to worry about winning you also have to worry about losing.<p>Nothing is stopping the defending counsel from getting a team of high priced lawyers, verses the 1 you could afford, and stuffing you with the bill of not only your lawyer, but all of theirs.<p>There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the US civil court system.[1] Just like there isn't a knifing epidemic in the UK. People see these cases in the media and get the idea this is common when it really isn't. This is what people that want to reform the tort system are trying to convince you. It's not the small businesses that have a problem with the current system.

When you're new to not just Node but programming itself - understanding the terms used is in itself a challenge. I'm writing my very first app and i chose to do it in Node. I started to suspect i was going to hit the problems described in this chapter very soon but i had no clue what terms to search or where to look.<p>At least now i know what control flow actually means, and while i havent understood the examples completely at least its given me enough of a taster to start thinking about it.",1329314599

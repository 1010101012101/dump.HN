I'll never have to implement a sorting algorithm.  I do, however, have to understand that a best-case comparison sort is O(log N), and that if I just want to scan out the top-10 items in a long list, I'm better off with a linear scan (O(N)).  I need to know that keeping data in sorted order will let me binary-search on it, for O(log N) access, and that cache & memory hierarchy effects often mean that this is faster than the O(k) access I might get with a prefix trie.  I need to know that passing nearly-sorted data to QuickSort, in the absence of something like median-of-3 partitioning, can result in pretty pathological runtimes.  I need to know that QuickSort can be done in-place, but MergeSort requires O(N) additional space.  OTOH, MergeSort can be done efficiently in situations where mutation and random access are not allowed (eg. tape drives, functional languages), which other sorts don't do so well.  I need to know what a stable sort is (very important for UI programmers!) and which algorithms have that property.  I need to know that passing the first 80% of sorted input to a statistical or machine-learning algorithm and then saving the last 20% for your test set will give you pretty odd results. :-)<p>Hashing is similar: you don't want to implement it yourself.

The iPhone 3G works in the iPad dock (by the looks of it the iPhone 4 will also) Audio out is a different issue since Apple has changed the way the dock connector outputs audio on the iPhone for integration with car audio systems to reduce GSM interference.

But two main reasons pushed me away:<p>1) Encrypted logs.  I think it is crucial to have readable log files to be able to understand what is happening with the drive array.  If there is proprietary information that the company wishes to be protect, I welcome them to do so.  There should be two files: one which is plaintext with the major status and event messages, and one which is encrypted with their proprietary information.  Rolling the plaintext log into the encrypted log seems like a user-hostile posture.<p>2) Maintenance costs.  If the log files are encrypted, then when the array fails (not ""if"", ""when"") then I will need to buy drobocare ($129) to get them to read the logfile to tell me what happened.  I expect to keep this array running for the next 4-6 years, and I am not willing to buy ongoing yearly maintenance ($250/three years) just find out how the array is doing.<p>Like I said, I was hours away from ordering a drive, I really like the simplicity of the design, but thanks to some of the comments on this thread I suddenly realized that I would signing up for years of maintenance fees. \nThat's not what I wanted.",1278389911

The time slices come in intervals that are in the audio range, and thus its energy output is measurable in the audible range.  Since the radio signals will induce a current in random wires, including wires in your audio amplifier, you can hear the GSM noise in your speakers.  It is not related in any way to an unclean audio signal coming out of your phone; that signal has no GSM noise.  It's the radio communication that induces noise in your audio equipment.

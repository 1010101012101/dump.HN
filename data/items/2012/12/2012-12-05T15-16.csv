Its function to serve as a platform for a suite of scientific instruments to gather data.  That suite of scientific instruments will be different for the next rover, adjusted based on what we now currently know (and didn't know the last time they chose instruments).  So, yes, its ""another"" rover. But its what that rover is carrying that is different and interesting.<p>Having said that, I'm all for being a lot more ambitious, and sending people to Mars instead.

No, what some governments start questioning is ICANN and especially IANA powers.<p>IANA is overseeing the whole IP allocations business and supervise root DNS management which give it a huge power over the network. However, while private, ICANN operates under a DOC contract and is headquartered in LA.

4876781,comment,4876096,4876656,7,0,dirtyaura,,,"I stated it in another comment, but the mobile-first strategy is more about user interaction design than implementation technology choices. The decision between HTML5 or native app or HTML5 wrapped as an app will be different in a year, but the fact that users are using most services mainly from mobile or tablets won't.<p>If you start a new startup today and you have resources to design a single user experience, it's a choice of designing for mobile/tablets or for laptops. Responsive design is not a solution here, as you have to think full user flows.<p>It's questions like how much text a user is willing to input? How will they pay? How will they bring their own data to your service? If you are selling anything virtual, you should probably leverage native in-app payment methods instead of expecting user to input credit card details. If user needs to bring his data  (photos, documents, Excel sheets) to your service, how he will do it?

I'm against handouts as much as anyone (it's a loan though), but try making a comment like this afterward.<p>The difficulties he went thru to keep Tesla afloat were outrageous.  By this time he been dumping his fortune into both this and SpaceX and was essentially at the point of personal bankruptcy (ie. was friends/associates time to keep moving, no one was willing to continue investing).  Note in the article the sentence ""Last month, Mercedes parent company Daimler also invested $50 million for a 10 percent stake in Tesla.""  Do yourself a favor and learn what Tesla actually did to make this happen.  Yes, you may have heard they retrofitted Smart Cars with the Tesla power train, but <i>how</i> they did that is a breathtaking example of innovation and teamwork for a company at the brink of death.<p>In short, this loan saved the company.  This article we're discussing right now would not exist.  Tesla Motors would be another footnote in history that people could point to - ""automotive startups are a losing proposition, do not invest"".  Would you rather the government bet on a guy like Elon who's actually putting his all into carrying out on a promise to change the game, or industry stalwarts who pissed away good will by incompetence and greed?",1354722950

Their entire supply chain is built around making and selling cars that run on gas engines.

While you could correctly assert that a 30 character long lower case letter only phrase has less entropy than a 15 character sequence of randomly generated numbers, letters of mixed case and punctuation, it makes no odds to me - I'm getting neither of them in a reasonable timeframe.<p>The reason for this is that if you look at the way web site passwords and company passwords are compromised it's not a single account that's hacked. It's going to be the domain or the database of password hashes. Because you're running all of these through a cracker at once you can't (as an attacker) generally afford to waste the time going through combinations of dictionary words with permutations, especially if you know that if you crack a big enough percentage of passwords you've got the access you need and can move on.<p>Cracking one 10 character random password with alphanumeric and special characters is a problem of scale with the password generaton algorithm. Depending on the algorithm used you can wait for appropriate rainbow tables to appear to increase your chances, for a cryptographic flaw in the algorithm or for moore's law to catch up. Trying to exhaust the same keyspace for a 30 character password (bearing in mind that the attacker is unlikely to know whether or not your password is high or low entropy, especially if other cracked passwords imply a high entropy policy is in place) is going to be much harder, and will only likely take place if no results of value have been found earlier on.",1354721998

4876658,comment,4876096,4876096,2,0,dirtyaura,,,"My idea of the mobile-first strategy (or it's younger sibling: a tablet-first strategy) is that in it's core it defines how you approach user interaction design. In the future, most of consumer internet services and a significant number of business tools are primarily used via mobile devices and tablets. In my opinion, this is a safe bet to make and startups starting today should make that bet.<p>However, it doesn't dictate neither your initial distribution strategies or your platform or technology choices today. For example you design a mobile user experience, but implement it with HTML 5 and Javascript and wrap that implementation to an app for distribution (and payment) purposes. Or you implement that as a native app because at the moment you can create a smoother experience that way. Or you skip the app part and build just an easy mobile web experience to make on-boarding easy. Distribution tactics and technologies change as mobile platforms evolve, but the fact you need to design for mobile usage doesn't.<p>Our new startup is doing serious data analysis tool, but from the surface it looks like a very simple tool. We believe this simplicity is essential to succeed in the world where our service will be mainly used via tablets and mobile phones.",1354721532

I know plenty of people who read the original post on the AVC blog. Most of us didn't buy it then, and still don't.<p>The fact is that today there is very little you can't do in a browser app and can do to a useful extent in a mobile app. Mobile browsers are driving support for HTML5 features and Javascript tools supporting useful features like geolocation, and they do it well enough to meet a lot of needs now.<p>If I write a browser app then I have a few portability/degradation issues to deal with, but I'm only maintaining one code base so I can spend all my development time getting those things right. If I write mobile apps, I need a whole new app on each platform I want to support, plus  I still need a browser app or a native executable for each major platform if I want to support customers on desktops/laptops as well.<p>If I write a browser app then I can charge however I like using a variety of services, and aside from taxes and overheads for collecting payment it's all mine. If I write mobile apps, I'm losing an absurd proportion of revenues to the likes of Apple when people buy my app, and I have to comply with all kinds of onerous rules about charging later too.<p>If I write a browser app then I can distribute it under my control. If I write mobile apps, then I have app stores and their infamous approval processes to get through, and if they decide they don't like me, all my effort was for nothing.<p>In short, mobile apps <i>suck</i> (from a business or software development perspective). They have exactly one redeeming feature, in that you can still do a few things with them that are harder or impossible with web apps, and even that advantage is reducing almost by the day. Otherwise, for most information consumption or communication software -- which is, let's face it, about 99.99% of what everyone is running on mobile devices anyway -- it's hard to see any reason to invest in mobile apps today.",1354721501

The problem is the ITU, which set up the regulatory structure that prevents amateur radio from ever being anything more than a hobby.<p>If we took some of the spectrum that was handed over to 4g cell providers and gave it to amateurs, and created a regulatory system that encouraged amateur stations to act as repeaters, routers, and gateways, we could have a decentralized wireless internet in short order.  We should create a new class of amateur licensing, specifically for packet switched networks, that allows a station to repeat a commercial transmission (e.g. someone directing their web browser to Amazon or Google), allows the use of cryptography without requiring key disclosure, allows profanity, allows communication with unlicensed stations (e.g. someone's laptop), etc.  There is no technical reason this cannot be done, and amateur radio operators are just as capable of setting up and maintaining a packet switched network as commercial services are (and perhaps even better; Comcast has pretty bad bufferbloat problems).<p>The ITU establishes standards and regulatory recommendations that are intended to protect the power of telecom monopolies.

There are some of the things we ran into with our ""system"" that I thought I'd share.<p>1. It would nice to have more advanced logic. For example, if I had a matrix question ranking my like or dislike of an array of sports, it would be nice to allow control flow so that I could ask follow up questions on sports I didn't like. You could do that now with separate questions for each sport (Do you like basketball? Yes/ No -> Explain), but if you rated them in a matrix there is really no way to do that as far as I can tell.<p>2. Using previous answers as variables of following questions. (What did you order for lunch? Sub/Pizza) -> (Did your find your %answer% to your liking)? You could accomplish this by having the Sub answer follow one path and the Pizza answer follow another path. But that would create separate questions for reporting when really you just wanted to know if they enjoyed their order, but you'd like to personalize the question based on their own answers.<p>3. Another logic example might be that regardless of an answer on question A, you'll go to question B, but question B might have some of it's options disabled based on the answer to question A. Again, your system could handle this by branching each answer on question A to it's own path with a modified version of question B only showing the relevant options, but I would again assume that this would create separate question B's in reporting when you might not want that.<p>I do realize these are edge cases and someone needing this functionality might not be your target audience. Just thought I'd share.<p>Great, great job so far. As others have said, it looks really good and I found it really intuitive.",1354720059

4876520,comment,4876096,4876096,3,0,gbog,,,"The interesting bit that I'd like to se more explored is the quote about ""two companies that will not help app developers succeed"". Those two are obviously Apple and Google, and I think a key of the problem could be right there, under our nose.<p>Why would Apple and Google not want to help independent devs push their apps on apps markets? (Let's suppose this statement to be true for a sec). We can find many reasons for Apple and Google to avoid random cowboys getting successful with a piece of code on ""their"" phone. First, it is concurrence. Google Reader has a lot of unofficial clients, and it must be some kind of annoyance, because they might not use the APIs as intended. Indie apps might bridge unwanted links with bigger competitors, or might just pollute the app store with ugly icons, semi-porn, ponzy schemes, or simply noise.<p>But from their point of view, maybe these companies consider themselves as elephants carrying most of the weight (hear development cost) and just don't want to let a horde of monkeys jump on their back and disturb the convoy. And we need to agree that this convoy has to get his way into the bush.<p>So app devs should go back to good ol' Web, following Vibhu Norby's advice? That smells like a defeat. Fred Wilson is right in saying that mobile is future, ""like it or not"". The problem is we, as devs, should make this future ours. We should fight, and we have weapons. I'd love to see ""I broke out of my own jail"" stickers on every iThing on tech talks. We should hear and speak more about the forks of forks of Android. We should make it the new hype to have one phone in each pocket, each with a different system, all running ""pre-alpha"" obscure OSes. We should make it cool, easy or even normal to have one's own VPN-NAS-cloud where all the things connect.<p>(I might have gotten a slip too far, but) if we don't push hard on this, both Apple and Google may slowly bring us all towards the nightmarish path of MicroSoft, where hundred of thousand of slaves push the wheels of a Gigantic Golden Sphinx, and kiss their own blood on the whips of their executioners.",1354719984

We investigate things that are too risky or time-consuming for our product design groups to look into, with an eye towards making our company money in the future. We fund Ph.D. students in electrical engineering and computer science at university labs, and collaborate with them. But we don't (generally) push back the frontiers of human knowledge in our day-to-day work.<p>Things might be different at (say) IBM Research Zrich, doing work on atomic force microscopy, but that sort of thing seems to be the exception rather than the rule in industrial R&D.

The point of civilization is that we try to provide for ourselves things that are <i>not</i> just our rights, but our <i>desires.</i><p>(Show me where nature will automatically provide food for humans.)",1363045833

So what is this really reporting? If Comcast is faster than competitor Foo, is that just because a higher percentage of Comcast's subscribers are on a better plan?",1363045535

5359358,comment,5356309,5359124,5,0,aethertap,,,"Or switch to sustainably raised meat (that's the focus on my farm).  No medication of any kind, animals live on managed pasture that requires no inputs other than sun, air, and water.<p>Switching away from meat will certainly help to address the development of resistant microbes, but if you can make a switch instead to meat that was raised with regenerative pasture management practices, you can additionally have a large positive impact on many other environmental factors.  Look for terms like ""high-density grazing,"" ""holistic grazing,"" ""holistic management,"" or ""management-intensive grazing (MIG).""<p>This TED talk [1] covers some of the information, for more you can google around for the above terms (sorry I don't have a good link handy).  Correctly managing grazing livestock can actually reverse desertification and trap tons of carbon per year per acre in the soil.  Of course, doing it wrong can have the opposite effect, so if you go this route it's important to know whether your farmer is running his operation with land restoration in mind.<p>Conventional vegetable production also comes with a slew of its own problems (breeding of herbicide-resistant weeds [2] being something closely related to the topic at hand).  Eating in a way that doesn't cause harm is a tricky thing these days.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121002092839.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121002092839.ht...</a><p>*edited for formatting",1363043584

The artists were unappreciated, poorly paid, overworked, and restricted from working on anything that didn't fall well within the norms of the classic superhero archetype, even if it was a personal project.<p>When a company that deals in art gets to the point where they care more about protecting and propping up existing franchises than they do about producing original works, that company's usefulness has been exhausted.",1363043125

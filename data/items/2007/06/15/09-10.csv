If you have\na 50-page idea it is too long for a magazine. But it is too short for\na book. So if you wanted to get it distributed before the Web came\nalong, you had to drop in words until you reached 200 pages.""<p>I wanted to create an <i>open</i> and <i>collaborative</i> site for business book summaries.  There are already sites out there that charge between 100-200 USD a year for a stream of summaries, but that has two problems:<p>- Of course, it prices many people out of the market.<p>- More importantly, I want to create a place where people can discuss these books.  Reading something is only part of learning.   Going out and actually doing something is probably the best way, but being able to discuss ideas is also pretty helpful.<p>So... the result was this site, which I put together pretty quickly.  I had fun adding a few summaries (I found that writing down what I'd learned from a book forced me to think about it a bit more), got a few friends to add others, and here we are.<p>By signing up for the site and working on a summary or two, you get a link back to your own site, as well as a link to your amazon wishlist, with encouragement to visitors to spring for a book or two for people who have worked on high quality summaries.<p>Constructive comments/suggestions/whatever more than welcome!",1181900782

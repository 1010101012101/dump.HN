Such as &quot;how to make him ...&quot; or &quot;What he likes in bed&quot; or whatever.<p>Lots do, but, no, not every single one does. (Leaving aside for the moment whether the things you describe are actually PUA-equivalent.)<p>> It is so prevalent, women aren&#x27;t even aware of it, like a fish doesn&#x27;t notice the water.<p>Actually, they do notice it. For some women, its part of the reason they buy the magazines (though, usually -- unlike for self-proclaimed members of the &quot;PUA community&quot; -- <i>not</i> usually a point of <i>pride</i>.) For other women, its a source of entertainment, something to laugh about (either among each other or with male friends.)<p>For other women, its part of the reason they object to many mainstream women&#x27;s fashion & lifestyle magazines as reinforces of patriarchy and traditional gender roles.<p>But what is certainly <i>not</i> true is that they don&#x27;t notice it.<p>> Let a guy start learning some evo-psych, learn how to dress better, work on his conversation skills, and quit being a supplicative schlub ... and the Holy Hand Grenade of Guilt and Shaming gets tossed.<p>No, only when they proudly label <i>themselves</i> as members of a community whose very <i>name</i> is about using whatever knowledge or skills they have to manipulate women into sex.<p>You can&#x27;t really be surprised that people react to the labels you choose for yourself.",1383976645

I&#x27;d have to assume that the people at Twitter have access to more information and advice than I could possibly hope to understand. Even so, they choose to not use an auction or anything, but let GS make a huge amount for themselves and choice customers. There must be some reason these companies&#x27; allow their IPOs to be managed that way.<p>I also do not quite understand how &quot;winning the good graces of the market&quot; means anything. Unless they&#x27;re suggesting that Twitter is planning on tens of millions of more shares in the future, and hoping a good IPO leads to even higher &quot;long term&quot; share price.<p>In the case of FB: If FB stock had stayed at $20 or so, would that really affect FB?

Sure, they should care deeply about the price it settles at, because that&#x27;s how they&#x27;ll attract talent in the future and bases how they&#x27;ll price future offerings, but the actual amount of pop itself?  I don&#x27;t see it.<p>This gem from the article:<p><i>>Should a stock offering maximize value for the companies selling shares, for the investors looking to gobble those shares up or for early employees and funders? And why are investors buying the shares  because they love the companys fundamentals or because they sense a good deal?</i><p>This is a ridiculously false dichotomy.  In any efficient market, sellers are trying to raise the price as far as the demand will bear, and buyers should be willing to purchase up to their estimated value of the company, taking into account their risk tolerance.  Price should be a tug-of-war between these actors.<p>The way I see it, there&#x27;s only two possibilities:<p>1) Pre-IPO Twitter thought there was a realistic risk of not fully selling the shares they put up if they raised the price.<p>2) Twitter purposefully got less money in a fair market trade than they could have.<p>And (2) seems totally insane to me for a rational actor. (1) seems plausible; apparently these things are hard to price.",1383975410

I think a better solution would be to do a one-time merciless chop-off of managers/people who don&#x27;t own/maintain a sufficiently large chunk of a product or are part of an org losing money.  This type of system just creates a toxic environment within the company and brings down employee morale. Not to mention, new talent would also start shying away from the company",1383974013

Cool! The ability to fetch the result of a write operation without having to do a SELECT afterward is one of my favorite &quot;minor perks&quot; of PostgreSQL. It eliminates the need for a lot of extra queries.<p>With MariaDB 10.0, only DELETE statements get the RETURNING clause. But it seems that they have plans to add it to UPDATE statements soon [1], and I hope INSERT gets it as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-5092"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-5092</a>",1383973907

We don&#x27;t have political and intellectual elites that aren&#x27;t cynical about our own values. It is not like we will punish some extreme Muslim treating his wife like a slave with a jail time. We will just be politically correct and say that&#x27;s his culture. Liberalism doesn&#x27;t go well with radicalism for some reason. Radical Liberals like Robespierre, Danton are needed. People who believe in our Western values enough to die in their name. If we are cynical about ourselves how on Earth can we compete with people who commit suicide because they believe in their values more than their life. That&#x27;s something we really need. We give up our values for nothing. Who cares about China? Our value is freedom of speech and people who don&#x27;t believe in freedom of speech were guillotined in Revolutionary France. I wish we could have elites today that would be as serious about freedom, liberalism and capitalism as French Revolutionaries were. I hope I will live to see it. Just tired of the apathy in the US.

Did you miss the bit of my post where I exhort Google to &quot;make this a paid service up-front&quot;? But what&#x27;s <i>not</i> cool is offering a means of universal personal identity for free (with the concomitant lock-in this entails), and then sneaking a clause into your TOS revealing your intentions to begin charging for this service at some future date, <i>especially</i> when there is no indication as to what the magnitude of that charge would be! $10 per year? I&#x27;d pay that, if my profile was especially important to me. I already pay as much for my personal domain names. $100 per year? Almost certainly not, unless G+ was the world&#x27;s most important social network. Or maybe it&#x27;s $X*N per year, where X is the number of unique visits your page gets per year and N is an arbitrary multiplier? We have absolutely no idea! We can&#x27;t even speculate.

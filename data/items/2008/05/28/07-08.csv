201874,comment,201819,201869,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I bought a new Fujitsu laptop that came preloaded with Vista. Technically the machine is no slouch.<p>Right-clicking on the network button to open a network connection reults in a grey box loading and hanging on the page for 10 seconds or so before it disappears. At that point you <i>can</i> click on the exact same icon and have a list of options, one of which is ""Open Network Connection"". Clicking on that results in another 10 second wait, after which a list of possible networks to connects to opens up.<p>Either one of those waits would be permissable if Windows really needed to check if the network existed (doesn't take that long under Ubuntu though....). But both? And for the system to show nothing but plain grey boxes?<p>Frankly, I don't find the OS particularly usable for anything except Photoshop. And I'll be getting around to installing Wine soon.",1211960582

With how I customized it, I hit apple+space to do normal stuff, option apple space to use it to access tho menu bar commands, etc.  You could set one shortcut to do normal stuff and another to customize.<p>Compare Vista plus any app you want with it.  If search is your priority, quicksilver is better.  I don't have a horse in this OS race (but I think Apple is generally brilliant and Microsoft lacks vision).  Plus, it's free.",1211960280
201871,comment,201819,201819,0,0,tx,,,"A lot of Vista bashing is coming form ex-Windows programmers being dog-tired of coding for this platform, which hasn't  been an enjoyable experience lately. Problem is that it's virtually impossible to code relatively complex software for Windows that can be installed on a typical ""Windows box"". There is no such thing anymore: Windows machines are like jungles populated by all kinds of trojans, software firewalls (often several of them), anti-popup programs, anti-spyware programs, anti-anti spyware, and so on... Computers are being sold new in a barely usable shape (pre-damaged by sacks of crapware), can you imagine what do they turn into after 2 years in average Joe's hands? Letting your code run down there without a programmer's supervision is like picking up a Burmese prostitute without a condom: can be done, but it's a tough exercise.<p>My friend got a Dell laptop and it's touchpad (made by Logitech) greets him every morning with a pop-up.

201869,comment,201819,201819,0,0,hsmyers,,,"""Works for me"" does not represent any useful information.Frankly I listen to the people it doesn't work for--- and they are legion. Since I develop for Windows (but open source for any) I have a machine that runs Vista, just like I have a machine that runs XP and another that runs W2K. Any thing else and I won't work for the client unless he gives me a machine to test with. From my experience (not lack of sample size, common to the blogger...) of the three only W2K is stable. Not to mention smaller, faster, simpler and a host of other superlatives. I intend sometime later tonight to OK VistaSP1 and I am prepared for the possible crash--- I believe myself to be safe since such problems were tied to AMD chips and not INTEL. By the way 'wumi' is a CPU one of those single points of failure you claim are all of the problem? And as for the new version of search in Vista; does any one know a working method to revert it back to at least XP if not W2k. There are many worthwhile 12 step programs in the world, windows search isn't one of them.<p>--hsm",1211959964

201866,comment,201556,201781,0,0,LPTS,,,"To my eyes it's an improvement.  Not perfect.<p>I think you should put the arrows to the left side, use simpler arrow graphics, and indicate the arrows are linked to the points by making them the same color.  Then, make the 1, 2, 3 a lighter color that is there, but more in the background, and delineated in function.  You also need to center them between the points and the left edge of the screen.  They are slightly too far to the right to my eyes. This would meet your informational requirements while clearing the clutter that is harshing my zen.  I think you should keep the change in the screenshot too.  The balance is just so much better.",1211959599
201865,comment,201819,201819,0,0,axod,,,"You don't win by being ""good"". You win by being outstanding. MS died and stopped being relevent to anything much a long while ago.<p>What features does vista have that XP doesn't that are worthwhile? What is pushing people to upgrade? Nothing as far as I can see.<p>Now you can buy PCs without an OS, and some very cool portables like the asus eeepc using linux, I'd expect MS dominance to take a major bashing over the next years on PCs. Not to mention the march of Apple.<p>You can't really start an article with ""As Apple fanboyism has spread throughout the tech publications"" and expect to be taken seriously. Especially when you then churn out obvious Microsoft fanboyism.<p>I think to be honest the whole point is becoming moot. The operating system is becoming irrelevent. Everything is moving onto the web (Despite ms trying hard to stop it by adding bugs and incompatibilites into IE ;) ). Luckily though IE is nose diving in usage.<p>Add to that the new motherboards that ship with linux for a fast startup into a browser, and what is the reason for most people to boot into a full blown monolithic beast such as vista?",1211959493

201863,comment,201556,201791,0,0,LPTS,,,"""Can you expound on what's you find horrible about the points and the arrows.""<p>The way they look.  Your assessment of the problem is good.  You gotta connect the points with the arrows.  BUT, the way you does it looks horrible.  I don't know how else to say it.  FSJ says ""It harshes my zen"" and that's about the best I can do.  Like, in just this one little corner, I'm flashing back to AOL in 1995 or any of a million badly designed games from windows 95.  You have a good grasp of your problem, you just need a cleaner looking solution.<p>I actually think having up and down arrows is too much, but I doubt that's the kind of feedback you are looking for.<p>If you keep the domain where it is you should make the fonts clash less.  Make that look the same as the other stuff on the line.  Then it flows nice.  It doesn't flow nice when the font is the same as the metadata but you aren't treating it like metadata (I think).<p>It's obvious you've thought through the redesign.  Is nice to see signs of intelligence!",1211958982

If a program causes Windows to crash, where it wouldn't have without that program, it could be said to be the program's fault. I tend to agree with you, since the point of Windows is to be a platform on which programs run, and found myself on that side of the argument against a number of PalmOS fans not that long ago.<p>You could easily say either party (or both) were at fault, but Windows will be the one more damaged by it.

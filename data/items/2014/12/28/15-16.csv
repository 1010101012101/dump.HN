This can be useful, but it won&#x27;t always work in a polyglot environment and introduces coupling which may mean that services have to be released in parallel to maintain the implicit interface between them.

Took many months of recovery and I was lucky my doctor knew what it was. I had heat treatment, some sort of laser and vibration therapies and a couple of other things. Don&#x27;t know which of them helped, but they sure did.<p>The second time, I was in a different country and was sent to a surgeon. He had no clue what RSI was and said that I should not worry until it gets worse and ready for Carpal Tunnel surgery. I said &quot;no thanks&quot; and found a sports therapist instead who was ready to help.<p>The main lesson here is that &quot;see a doctor&quot; does not always work. I am sure if I saw surgeon the first time, I&#x27;d be having some stitches on my wrists right now. Back then, RSI was not well known thing at all.

RAM costs absolutely nothing these days, the modems they&#x27;ve selected is also quite questionable considering it&#x27;s made by a subsidiary of Gemalto especially for a &quot;privacy&quot; oriented device.\nAnd 512MB Flash? this just puts unnecessary limitation on future developments of the Phone, which also means that it will probably not be well supported by the latest Meego forks or any major Linux distribution.<p>BTW according to their latest schematics i don&#x27;t see any decent level of separation between the BPP and the SOC not on a hardware level at least, it seems that for the most part they still rely on the software to bring the modem back in line which well is iffy to begin with.<p>Just based on the hardware they put in the phone there is no reason for it to cost 100 EURO&#x27;s not to mention 800-900.

That said, they&#x27;re also extrapolating from existing trends. An inordinate amount of office work today (including a lot of software development) exists solely to keep people busy.<p>While that might sound absurd, consider the following:<p>* Companies, particularly large ones, need to have staff on hand for when heavy work hits, but can&#x27;t just fire them in their off season, not without destroying morale.<p>* Classic hiring practices are terrible at selecting for actual technical ability, and no one wants to trust the demonstrably valuable work to &quot;the new person.&quot; Busy-work provides a way to test their proficiency without ruining the business in the process.<p>* Management prestige (and pay) is often tied to one&#x27;s direct report head-count. Worse, stack rankings and similar systems tie career <i>survival</i> to extraneous, buffer head-count.<p>* Firing someone is surprisingly hard in most companies. A single lawsuit or a few days of outage from a legacy system maintained by only one curmudgeon can wipe out all the (on-paper) savings from firing an ineffective or even counter-productive person.<p>* Some managers genuinely care about their employees, and want to shield them from the existential and health threats of losing their job and insurance.",1419781745

For example, if one question on the questionnaire influences how survey takers answered subsequent questions, then we might well fail to replicate the results of an older study. You might then conclude that the older study isn&#x27;t as generalizable as you thought it would be and that you need more research to figure out when exactly the effect occurs or not.

Do you have tap-to-click turned on, or do you use press harder with your nose to trigger the magic trackpad&#x27;s &quot;click&quot; threshold? If the latter, does your nose hurt after prolonger use?<p>* What kind of gestures do you have? What kind of gestures would you create, if you could create any gestures at all? Have you found third-party software to facilitate this? (I imagine the default software hasn&#x27;t considered mouth gestures at all)<p>* Do you use this setup for your creative work alone, or for casual computer usage as well?<p><i>Performance & Accuracy</i><p>* You mention that you&#x27;ve gained the same level of accuracy as with your hands, and that&#x27;s the most important factor (to me, at least). A secondary one, though, would be speed. <i>Do you notice any considerable difference in your &quot;input performance&quot; when you use the nose/mouth setup vs. traditional input methods?</i> How was your learning curve with respect to accuracy and then speed? (I&#x27;d expect you to have gained accuracy first and then built up performance over time)<p>* What&#x27;s your pointer speed & acceleration like? I imagine both to be quite low, otherwise you&#x27;d have to perform very precise and minute movements in order to to high-precision stuff. For example, can you move your pointer from top-left corner of your screen to your bottom right with one movement? (I would think not). Is that the kind of thing that you&#x27;d complement with a mouse?<p>* Tangent on previous question: Are your &quot;nosepad&quot; settings (speed/accel) different than your trackpad/mouse settings? If not, is that a System limitation that you have accepted (optimizing for the nosepad, I&#x27;d imagine)?<p><i>Social</i><p>* Do you receive negative real-world reactions to your setup? Are people largely accepting & encouraging?<p>* What kind of feedback & reactions have you received online, after publishing this?<p>I&#x27;d like to <i>emphasize again</i> that I was blown away by your creativity. You exhibit the hacker spirit to the fullest. If you receive any hate because of this, I hope my enthusiasm counteracts that a bit :) I know that one negative comment can outweigh 1000 positive ones.<p>EDIT - more question(s)<p>* How has your posture evolved through time?

Because it was the richest place in the world at the time, full of gold and silver and the crusaders were more interested in loot than in defending the faith.<p>After the crusaders took constantinople, the byzantine empire broke up into several countries, some controlled by crusaders, some by greeks. Eventually the greeks took constantinople back but by that time it was depopulated from continuous war. And the greeks were never able to get the entire empire back together.

Are we trying to do a year in review, to see which predictions of 2014 turned out in reality?<p>As for the substance of this interesting submitted article, the historical facts are reviewed in a key paragraph before the article goes off into speculation about the future: &quot;For much of the 20th century, those arguing that technology brought ever more jobs and prosperity looked to have the better of the debate. Real incomes in Britain scarcely doubled between the beginning of the common era and 1570. They then tripled from 1570 to 1875. And they more than tripled from 1875 to 1975. Industrialisation did not end up eliminating the need for human workers. On the contrary, it created employment opportunities sufficient to soak up the 20th century’s exploding population. Keynes’s vision of everyone in the 2030s being a lot richer is largely achieved. His belief they would work just 15 hours or so a week has not come to pass.&quot; The nub of the article&#x27;s argument is that new forms of technological change might not leave us with any new forms of gainful employment.<p>After its interesting text discussion and chart predicting what kinds of employment are least likely to be automated out of existence, the article points out one difference between the world of the past and the world of today: &quot;Another way in which previous adaptation is not necessarily a good guide to future employment is the existence of welfare. The alternative to joining the 19th-century industrial proletariat was malnourished deprivation. Today, because of measures introduced in response to, and to some extent on the proceeds of, industrialisation, people in the developed world are provided with unemployment benefits, disability allowances and other forms of welfare. They are also much more likely than a bygone peasant to have savings. This means that the &#x27;reservation wage&#x27;—the wage below which a worker will not accept a job—is now high in historical terms. If governments refuse to allow jobless workers to fall too far below the average standard of living, then this reservation wage will rise steadily, and ever more workers may find work unattractive. And the higher it rises, the greater the incentive to invest in capital that replaces labour.&quot; Indeed, it may be that the funding of governmental benefits will become secure enough through rising productivity that many current workers will have children who do not need a job at all.",1419779549

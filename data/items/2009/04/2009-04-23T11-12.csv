I happen to really like the relational paradigm, but the syntax etc. of SQL has plenty of historical cruft.<p>(As a bonus, ditching MySQL would probably help shrug off a lot of inaccurate assumptions about real RBDMSs.)",1240487950

It was much more expensive and painful to get applications signed on Symbian, especially if you wanted to run on many types of phones.<p>I think the background here is prior to OS X versions of the Mac OS. Lots of apps patched system calls etc -- and it was Hell to make new versions of the O/S (Microsoft was ""famous"" for breaking all coding guidelines in Word et al and e.g. patching system data structures directly). This was a big contributor to Apple's problems making the next version of the Mac OS.<p>(Excuses in advance for memory errors; this was some time ago.)",1240487567

Some scientists say it has such racist implications it's unworthy of consideration.""<p>Why is this troubling? What are the racist implications? I thought being more intelligent is a virtue. Or are people afraid that, if there's someone who is smarter than average, clearly there must be someone else who is dumber? 
In any case, though, a hypothesis does not become more or less valid because of its political or social implications.<p>Everybody can see that blacks in general (or I suppose with a certain genetic history) can jump higher than average white. The average European descendent can jump higher than the average East Asian.<p>So what?! You still get Obama and you still get Yao Ming. As long as the rules are the same for everyone (as they should), it's all about individual effort and luck. The average is irrelevant for policy or social efforts. It should be only of scientific interest.",1240487413

And masses will create application for themselves using the ""So easy to use that your mom can build it"" tools which they will consider ""good enough"".<p>Think about the progression, assembly -> C/C++ -> PHP -> Ruby. Ruby wasn't a viable solution 10 years back because of its speed. But thanks to HW advances, now it’s good enough. Next extrapolate this trend. I shall stop here because the discussion will surely get depressing from here on.<p>But if advancement in HW stops, programmers demand will slow down too, as all software libararies and applications for that target get written and optimized.<p>It's a two way sword.",1240485779

When they were just starting out and forgot to tell the provider to get the monies from their credit card, or whatever, they would just disconnect the server or park the domain. Happened a few times and is really annoying. I had assumed it to be a function of the far better giro system here in Europe, but since a few months I'm paying most things by regular credit card bookings instead of bank transfer, and it still works.<p>Maybe people just need to ask for and demand automated payment?",1240485480

You can try to convince a gay person they aren't gay until you're blue in the face but I don't think it's going to get you anywhere.  If you're heterosexual try flipping the coin and imagine someone trying to convince you that you're gay.  I know it wouldn't work on me.<p>More of a concern to me is the whole ""lets deal with pedophiles our self"" message.  If you know of a pedophile it's probably a good idea to call the cops.  ""Counseling him"" and then having him apologize seems a little silly.  And by silly I mean criminally stupid<p>(come to think about it these people must have a high opinion of themselves if they think they can talk gay people out of being gay and pedophiles out of being pedophiles)",1240484629

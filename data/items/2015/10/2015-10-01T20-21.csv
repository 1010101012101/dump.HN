Cost and interoperability are the problem.<p>On the cost side of IoT, the rent is just too damn high: I don&#x27;t want to pay $50 for a fancy light bulb. I want to pay _maybe_ an extra 50 cents or $1 extra per bulb.<p>On the interoperability side: Most of the things I really care about are plugged into my home&#x27;s electrical sockets.

10314661,comment,10312938,10314217,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"Based on the news article, Amazon isn&#x27;t banning competitors. Roku competes with Fire TV, and the Netflix app it bundles competes with Prime Video. The article says Amazon will still sell Roku. Indeed, Amazon&#x27;s Fire TV also supports Netflix and Hulu and HBO and ESPN and whatnot, not just Amazon Video.<p>The news article says that they&#x27;re banning video streaming devices that don&#x27;t support Amazon Video. So if that&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re banning competitors, but that they&#x27;re forcing streaming devices sold on Amazon to support Amazon Video in addition to whatever else they support.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the primary motivation is, but I could genuinely see some customers being confused. Imagine you&#x27;re a customer that&#x27;s just signed up for Prime. You don&#x27;t have a TV stick to watch it on, so you shop around the store and find a streaming device that&#x27;s highly reviewed. You buy it and plug it in, only to find that Amazon Video does not work on it, or works poorly. This is plausible; this kind of thing happens, especially with unsophisticated, less computer savvy buyers (the kind of people who think the Google search box is the Internet). I could easily see my parents making this kind of mistake.<p>Whether that&#x27;s the primary motivation, I wouldn&#x27;t know. It seems like you could also deal with that problem by changing the way the product is displayed, for people who have Prime Video, and show a big warning like &quot;This product does not support Prime Video&quot; on the side so they can&#x27;t overlook that fact when buying it. (Though this could lead to other complications - I could imagine there being weird legal or anti-competitive issues with making claims like that about competitors&#x27; products in a way that they can&#x27;t control, that&#x27;s not part of the product description. Banning them might be the simplest way.)",1443733142

Eventually your engineer isn&#x27;t going to be able to get any work done, and productivity grinds to a halt.  It also puts a big damper on doing any large features, speculative features, hard features, or basically anything that requires sustained concentration for long periods of time.<p>Indeed, as a tech lead, one of the signals I use for when it&#x27;s time to introduce a formal process and bugtracker is when the engineers on my team start complaining that they can&#x27;t get any work done because they&#x27;re being pulled in too many directions at once.  If it&#x27;s not a problem, then there&#x27;s no need to slow yourself down with process to fix it.  But if it is a problem, it&#x27;s good to have a strategy that captures all the work that needs to be done and lets everyone coordinate who & when they&#x27;ll do it.",1443732258

SC builds on many assumptions and understandings of our workload that we did not have when we started with Storm.<p>For us we decided this was the path that would lead to the quickest and highest reward, and we were able to justify the effort by not only halving our infrastructure footprint, but being able to scale the next 10x.

A meta-merchant based out of the US should simply not be able to discriminate based on content, unless it also wishes to assume legal responsibility for those things it <i>does</i> allow to be sold in its marketplace.  Someone, somewhere, will want to sell what I want to buy, and it is no more Amazon&#x27;s place to prevent us from doing business on their general-purpose e-commerce platform than it is AT&T&#x27;s or Verizon&#x27;s place to prevent us from talking over their phone networks.<p>The instant you pull CSA flags from your marketplace, everything else becomes a de facto Amazon-approved product.  Like ISIS propaganda magazines.  Whoops, better ban that, too.  Eventually, it reaches the point where some employee has to decide whether a fill-in-the-blanks legal boilerplate form can be sold by a merchant that is not a licensed attorney in the buyer&#x27;s state.<p>Because if Amazon removed some offensive or illegal products, customers may rely on that when shopping, and assume that anything else bought from Amazon must therefore be legal and non-offensive.  If Amazon wants to do that, fine.  But do it on curated.amazon.com or only.amazon.com rather than the main www.amazon.com site.  Maybe I&#x27;ll go there if I only want to see stuff sold directly by Amazon without having to check that box in the search results every time.<p>Curated marketplaces are fine, but only so long as there is a free, uncurated alternative.  I think Apple <i>should</i> be forced to allow uncurated stores (like Cydia) or curated-by-someone-else stores (perhaps a Google Play for iOS) for those who wish to assume the additional risks posed by such offerings.  They are certainly allowed to preload their own store, and make it the default, but if I want to take my property out of the walled garden, they had damned well better unlock the gates and let me leave.<p>In my opinion, the extent to which the platform is completely neutral is inversely proportional to the responsibility the platform operators have for the things that make use of it.

Oh, you think it&#x27;s built on web services running on cloud architecture. On fulfillment centers, supply chains, and all of that jazz.

And Amazon has the best selection of stuff at the best prices and the smoothest transition from exchanging money for a product to having that product in your hands a short time later.<p>That customer-company bond is what keeps Amazon humming.

For sensor networks, there is rarely a good reason not to use one of the more popular sub-1GHz bands 433/868/915 regardless of your geographic location.",1443731938

Pardon the interruption!<p>For years I have wanted to help make it easy for you to see useful ads and block annoying ones. I am excited to tell you that it&#x27;s finally happening.<p>AdBlock is now participating in the Acceptable Ads program. Acceptable Ads defines strict guidelines to identify non-annoying ads, which AdBlock now shows by default. This way, you can help support your favorite websites -- and if you still want to block every ad, you can disable this easily.<p>Want more details?
</snip>
You can learn more about Acceptable Ads here. Like I said: AdBlock has enabled this feature by default, but you can can disable it in AdBlock’s Options if you ever want to block every ad.
I think you&#x27;ll really like the change. Happy surfing!<p>Michael<p>PS: Why now? Well, I have always shared similar goals for the Web with the ad blocker Adblock Plus, who created the Acceptable Ads program. But I did not like the fact that they also control the program, because they are supported by some Acceptable Ads advertisers. Now, Adblock Plus will be transferring custodianship of Acceptable Ads to an impartial group of experts. I love this idea -- in fact, it was my wife Katie’s suggestion! Due to this change, I&#x27;m happy for AdBlock to join the program. As a result, I am selling my company, and the buyer is turning on Acceptable Ads. My long-time managing director will keep working with the new company. I believe this is a great thing for you users.<p>It&#x27;s been an honor to make the Web a better place for you! :)",1443731517

Pardon the interruption! 
For years I have wanted to help make it easy for you to see useful ads and block annoying ones. I am excited to tell you that &#x27;s finally happening.<p>AdBlock is now participating in the Acceptable Ads program. Acceptable Ads defines strict guidelines to identify non-annoying ads, which AdBlock now shows by default. This way, you can help support your favorite websites -- and if you still want to block every ad, you can disable this easily.<p>Want more details?<p>I think you&#x27;ll really like the change. Happy surfing!<p>Michael<p>PS: Why now? Well, I have always shared similar goals for the Web with the ad blacker Adblock Plus, who created the Acceptable Ads program. But I did not like the fact that they also control the program, because they are supported by some Acceptable Ads advertisers. Now, Adblock Plus will be transferring custodianship of Acceptable Ads to an impartial group of experts. I love this idea -- in fact it was my wife Katie&#x27;s suggestion! Due to this change, I&#x27;m happy for AdBlock to join the program. As a result, I am selling my company, and the buyer is turning on Acceptable Ads. My long-time managing director will keep working with the new company. I believe this is a great Wing for you users.<p>It&#x27;s been an honor to make the Web a better place for you! :)",1443731349

(This might or might not be related to something I&#x27;m working on)  Seems like a simple little technical problem for the refrigerator manufacturer, right?  At the physical layer, it totally is.  We can drop wifi points and 802.11b radios all over the globe and we&#x27;re in business.  The restaurant chain is happy - the equipment vendor has handled it all and we&#x27;re on our way.<p>But now all that data is coming into a server somewhere.  And the questions start piling up:<p>1) Who owns that server?  The restaurant chain or the fridge maker?  Is the data proprietary?<p>2) Who is paying for the server maintenance?  Who&#x27;s paying for the broadband connections in every store?<p>3) Who is going to write the dashboard that lets corp see the nifty graphics about system uptime?  Who maintains that?  Where does it live?<p>So should the fridge maker switch to a subscription model and rent out the units?  That&#x27;ll take care of the cost.  But if the restaurant is renting the units, then surely the fridge maker should be on 24/7 call to service these units when they fail!  Oops, now the fridge maker needs to implement a service team.<p>This is a holy mess.  There are plenty of middlemen popping up to handle the cloud layer like Digi and Exosite.  But in the end someone has to write the check and neither side wants to do it.  The restaurant wants their food safety data without the added cost.  The fridge maker wants to sell units and minimize the support cost.<p>Companies like Amazon are in a much better position because that Dash button feeds directly into their ecosystem.  For the rest of the world, the world that IoT is trying to target, they&#x27;re still out in the cold.",1443731296

In other words, I have tried it for myself. :-) If you’re somewhere in the SF Bay Area and want to discuss in more detail, I’d be happy to give a mini-lecture about the subject, or about human color vision more generally.<p>At the typical brightness of streetlamps outdoors in most cities, humans are using photopic rather than scotopic vision (that is, using the “medium” and “long” cone photoreceptors), which is fairly sensitive to anything between about 500–650 nm. For photopic vision, the bright blue spike of a white LED provides almost no useful contribution to brightness perception.<p>Under starlight or moonlight and no artificial lights, you would be correct, but that’s not the condition we’re discussing. If outdoor lamps cast no more total light in aggregate than the moon, then bluer wavelengths would be fine. In practice they are several orders of magnitude brighter than the moon, which means they saturate the rods and mostly wipe out scotopic vision.<p>The cause of the nearsightedness epidemic (e.g. in East Asia) is children not going outside in the sun during the day. The details of the lamps they use at night (indoors or outdoors) are irrelevant to that.<p>I became interested in this topic because the streetlamps on my street were replaced by white LEDs at ~4000K CCT, and they are truly awful. They cause extreme amounts of peripheral-vision glare, and they make the previously charming street feel like a prison yard or sad industrial warehouse. The previous high-pressure sodium lamps are so so soooo much better.",1443730974

You could do as you say, trying to understand the question based on some of the words that appears using statistics. This is a &quot;bag of word&quot; approach.<p>The general idea of NLP is not different from general computer science ie. 1) narrow the problem 2) solve it 3) try to solve a bigger problem.<p>The tower of sentence structure in NLP is:<p>- bag of word<p>- part of speech + named enties tagging<p>- dependency tagging/framing<p>- semantic tagging<p>The idea is to create <i>templates</i> for most common questions. Then you parse questions recognizing the named entities like &quot;Capitol Hill&quot;, &quot;Seattle&quot; and commons &quot;appartement&quot; you can resolve the question. It&#x27;s not an ordinary <i>dictionary hash lookup</i> since for in given template there is several &quot;key&quot;. The value of the dictionary is the correct search method. It makes me think to multiple method dispatch which support dispatch by value.<p>Also something to take into account is that in the &quot;assistant&quot; example you give, the assistant can ask for confirmation. You don&#x27;t explicitly state that you are looking to &quot;rent&quot; something. So the system might not recognize the question, but just guess that you talk about renting something because it&#x27;s the most popular search around Capitol Hill, Seattle. You can implement a &quot;suggest this question&quot; feature that will feedback the &quot;question dispatch&quot; algorithm to later recognize this question.<p>This is mostly a Dynamic Programming approach. Advanced NLP pipelines use logic, probabilistic programming, graph theory or all of them ;)<p>The other big problems of NLP are:<p>- summary generation
- automatic translation<p>Important to note is that like other systems it must be goal driven. You can start from the goal and go backward infering the previous steps or do it from the initial data and go forward. Again, it&#x27;s very important to simplify. Factorize by recognizing patterns. It&#x27;s the main idea regarding the theory of the mind.<p>Have a look at this SO question [1] I try to fully explain an example QA. Coursera NLP course is a good start.<p>OpenCog doesn&#x27;t deal solely with NLP but gives an example of what a modern artificial cognitive assistant can be made of.<p>Beware that NLP is kind of loop-hole.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32432719/is-there-any-nlp-tools-for-semantic-parsing-for-languages-other-than-english/32670572#32670572"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32432719/is-there-any-nlp...</a>",1443730431

Since it seems to be on a whitelisted domain and match the original script&#x27;s hash, it will execute on the page, which is not ordinarily possible on a page which is running CSP.<p>I hope this encourages you to not immediately assume that large groups of people working on technically complicated problems are stupid in the future.",1443730330

Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch.

The only thing i would care for is for heating/AC because those tend to be on for very very long duration.<p>I bought a C rated fridge because I&#x27;ve read the testing procedure, it involves quite a bit of stuff like how long it takes it to cool down when the door is opened for 2 minutes, how much power it needs to cool down some volume of water etc, how much does it take to freeze X amount of what ever beef.<p>And i really don&#x27;t care about that, I live with my GF, no kids, no one else, the fridge is opened maybe 5 times a day for no longer than 10 seconds. Dinner is cooked daily with &quot;fresh&quot; from the store ingredients or take away/delivery is used.
So the fridge is used to cool fruits/soda/water milk, and and some toppings for snaks.<p>The freezer will have some emergency ground beef for the shit it&#x27;s too late to order pasta, some hot dogs when you really get lazy, some bread, and vodka.<p>If i had 3 kids and would stick a half eaten turkey into the fridge 3 times a week i would probably care more about how much power it yanks to cool it down, but with the use i have i don&#x27;t need to care because while it&#x27;s less efficient in cooling it&#x27;s just as efficient at doing nothing for most of the day because the insulation is still the same.<p>But the majority of the public doesn&#x27;t do it, almost no one is doing research before buying something, they might get some reviews of CNET at best but more likely got to Curry&#x27;s or Fry&#x27;s or Best Buy and buy something they think is good.

Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Japan have all been reclaiming islands in the same area on a smaller scale. China is just staking its claim alongside the rest, and while China is by far the biggest user of dredging to reclaim islands, they weren&#x27;t the first.<p>Russia invaded the undisputed, occupied territory of a sovereign nation (twice!) on trumped up reasons of &quot;protecting ethnic Russians&quot; -- as if &quot;ethnic Russian&quot; was a real thing. The Spratly Islands are the very definition of disputed territory; they&#x27;re claimed by half a dozen countries and have no meaningful settlements on them. I&#x27;m not saying that China has a claim to them, but their claim is no less valid than Japan&#x27;s or Vietnam&#x27;s.<p>Now, when they invade Taiwan, we can say they&#x27;re like Russia. But  they have not flexed their military might because they&#x27;re not yet a modern military. That will change over the next 10-20 years; and when you have a strong military, you tend to come up with ways to make use of it to achieve your strategic goals (again, this was a central theme of the original article).<p>Source for Spratly info: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/30/world/asia/what-china-has-been-building-in-the-south-china-sea.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/30/world/asia/wha...</a>",1443729802

The limitations imposed by the radio spectrum and its availability are at the root of every other point made by the author.<p>You just can&#x27;t have high bandwidth, excellent protection from interference, and low energy usage all at once. The blcoks of spectrum that offer the best balance of those qualities are already booked up for things like OTA TV broadcasts and &quot;high-cost and high-powered cellular&quot; networks. The issues with mesh networking are also immediately apparent if some classes of device are to be kept on separate networks or have to forgo their role as a node due to the power requirements of a repeater.<p>A simple example for what airwaves would look like in the crowded &quot;IoT&#x27; future is your average apartment complex and the 2.4ghz spectrum. 30+ routers competing for the same tiny space absolutely destroys the quality (latency, throughput, power draw from the devices radio) of the connection. The space is so crowded that you may only see 5-10 networks as the signal from a router 2 stories up is so dirty that you can&#x27;t even receive the SSID but the interference is still there.<p>There is only so much spectrum available for use, even if it was all unrestricted.

735733,comment,735534,735534,0,0,grellas,,,"A murky area even by normal standards of law. The article goes through the conventional analysis of what constitutes a contractor versus an employee.<p>Here are some practical points (of more particular interest to startups) that go beyond the formal analysis:<p>1. IRS uses a list of ""factors"" that, in practice, is so nebulous that most large businesses do not fool with taking chances unless they can bring their contractors within a ""safe harbor"" area.<p>2. A 1986 tax act provided that tech service providers would no longer get safe-harbor treatment and this immediately caused large tech companies to retain contractors strictly (or at least largely) through a cottage industry of agencies that cropped up in response to the change. From that point on, if you wanted to hire yourself to a large tech company as a consultant, you had to go through an agency or else be incorporated so they could hire your entity instead of you personally. Microsoft paid dearly some years back when it had a whole slew of contractors reclassified as employees after years of treating them as contractors.<p>3. The basic idea of the IRS ""factors"" is to determine if a contractor is really in an independent business or if the classification is merely a veneer for employee-like activity. One of the worst killers on this issue is if you have longish-term contractors performing routine duties that are a regular and recurring part of your core activities as a company - that activity spells ""employee"" to the IRS.<p>4. Early-stage startups usually have fewer issues in this area than do established companies, not because they handle this issue correctly, but because they are less likely to get snagged in an audit. Even small companies <i>can</i> get snagged, though, e.g., when one of its contractors gets terminated and goes to file for unemployment. Generally, however, small companies do not issue enough 1099's in any given year to raise that particular audit flag and so tend to fly under the radar on this issue.<p>5. A trap in this area is not to document the relationship. If you don't have a written agreement specifying that the individuals are independent contractors, you lose on the issue. If you do have a written contract so specifying, you gain nothing except that you don't lose automatically based on the absence of a proper written agreement alone.<p>6. Even without the safe harbor, it is usually safe to hire independent contractors who truly are in the business of providing services to multiple customers. There is no special risk here and startups routinely use the services of such contractors without incurring any special risks.<p>7. After a VC funding, you will normally want to go with straight employees for your startup, with exceptions of the type noted in #6 above. In addition to avoiding the reclassification risks associated with contractors, hiring people as employees is more conducive to protecting the company's IP and also enables the company to use better incentives in the form of incentive stock options (ISOs), which are available only to employees.<p>8. If you are using a lot of ""contractors"" in your early-stage startup, be absolutely sure that your startup is a limited-liability entity. If contractors get reclassified, the liability generally attaches to the entity only and not to its management. Penalties can be large because, if you cannot track the contractors down and get them to certify that they actually paid their taxes on their 1099 income, the company is required to pay (in addition to normal payroll taxes) an amount based on the estimated <i>income</i> tax that such contractors should have paid on that income. For this reason, if you get an audit covering a few years and have more than a handful of contractors reclassified, the total tax/penalty hit can easily run into six figures.<p>9. Based on all of the above, don't take needless risks in this area. Get good professional advice and try to do it by the book.",1249085852
735732,comment,734267,734336,0,0,Estragon,,,"That's pure ignorant bigotry, although it might be well-received in a crowd of programmers who also know nothing of what biological research is like.  You've got to keep in mind that the main task in biology is <i>inference</i> of biological structures and processes.  This is complicated by a number of factors: (1) Biological systems are typically way more complex than computer systems.  (2) They are comprised of components which are way too small to see in action or manipulate, so all inferences are from second-order effects presumed (often inaccurately) to arise from the subsystem under study.  Designing a biology experiment to cope with these difficulties is an exceptionally difficult skill to master.  Compare that to programming, where the central task is the <i>construction</i> of a procedure using well-understood components, the states of which can easily be queried.<p>Claiming that computer scientists would have an easier time learning biology than the reverse is like claiming that chess is a more sophisticated game than go because the lines of tactical analysis are often longer.  It ignores the relative complexities of the systems, and the fact that you can usually say more about the simpler system, and usually say it more elegantly.<p>Incidentally, I am not a biologist.  I am a mathematician who has moved into statistical genetics.  However, my last postdoc advisor was a formally trained biologist who taught himself statistics and computer science, and has made his career in bioinformatics.  But he could hold his own in both those fields.",1249085816

It just counteracts AAT ""claims"" with ""facts"" not backed with too much hard evidence.<p>The problem with the original AAT is that it piles together everything and the kitchen sink if there might be drawn a most remote connection between it and water. It's very easy to dismiss the theory as it was set -- but some individual aspects of it have a lot of merit, and even more mainstream anthropologists have started to seriously consider a possibility of an ""aquatic"" phase in human evolution. Our ancestors were probably never fully ""aquatic"", but were likely used to wading in shallow pools and similar bodies of water.<p>There is one thing we can be pretty certain when it comes to human evolution: at one point in time, our ancestors had no need for the natural protecting covering on their bodies (fur, which is used as protection from all kinds of hazards, including heat, cold, venom etc), so they lost it. The reason is almost certainly that their environment has somehow provided them with equivalent protection, and once they lost that protection they had to substitute it with some other covering, and this is how clothing was invented.<p>And the only natural protection we know of are water and earth.

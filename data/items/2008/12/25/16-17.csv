All crap.<p>your point: <i>the parents compete using their kids</i>\nit's right.<p>We don't see any of these kids in the newspapers when they are grown up. Why? Because these kids aren't born for what they are forced to do. Once they start using their brains, they change and begin to pursue what they want.",1230224186

409625,comment,409075,409220,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"I think this is high quality fearmongering.<p>Different aspects of what this guy is talking about happen all the time, all over the world.  Take Argentina in 2001, Chile in the early 70s, Bolivia in 2004 or so, and the Rodney King riots of 1992.  I've spoke to a teacher who was in Chile during the coup and he told me never in his wildest dreams did he imagine soldiers ransacking university libraries and burning books on the street.  Not in Chile!<p>Now of course, there are fearmongers who aren't worth listening to, but that doesn't mean this guy's one of them.  I think he's off on some points, but he tries to give an idea of what people can reasonably expect in the off chance there is a collapse.  It's not the end of the world, but it's worth thinking about.<p>Also, keep in mind that there are times when it makes a lot of sense to be afraid.  A lot of people are dead because they weren't scared enough to emigrate when they still had the chance.<p>Disaster scenarios are always shockers, perhaps because if people had the foresight to prepare for them they wouldn't be so disastrous.",1230222780

409623,comment,409562,409616,0,0,jd,,,"It's not that obvious where to draw the line. Executives of charities need to get paid. And because charities deal with large amounts of money, mismanagement can be very costly. By increasing the salary of the executives you can get more qualified people. As a result, the charity becomes more efficient and effective and everybody's happy.<p>Often charities have billions (?) of capital. If they hire a local private bank to look after the money they will have to pay for it, and the bankers will be driving porches. But if they manage the capital in house they suddenly can't compensate people for it similarly, because they're still a charity?<p>Charity.<p>Raise money: OK<p>Spend money: OK<p>Save money, use part of savings as bonus: Evil?<p>I haven't really thought this through, so my logic could be flawed. Still, I think that most charities should become more business-like. (Good) Businesses are, after all, all about creating value.",1230222623

409612,comment,409467,409600,0,0,kranner,,,"Well, I'd moved to Singapore for about six months and I returned (to India) a few months ago. Like the dog that didn't bark in the night, the time in Singapore was perfect - speaking of my digestion - without any special effort. But after I returned, the same old bloating and hard stools (sometimes quite painful) recurred. Obviously, these conditions became sufficiently irritating that I was forced to analyse.<p>After a bit of thought, I realized that the Chinese-ish diet in Singers was mostly soup-like with lots of hot water, whereas back here at home it's stiff grains like wheat and corn with lots of husk, with much less liquid ingested. So I figured I should try to make what's going in be of similar consistency to what I knew worked. I decided I would try it for a week, strictly, and it worked wonderfully. And so I've stuck to it.",1230221554

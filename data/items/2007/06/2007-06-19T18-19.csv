Really appreciate it (as well as many other people who've followed up on this).<p>I'm extremely experienced, so that's not really what I'm here to get.  I pick languages up fairly quickly, and I've been doing sole proprietor/freelance work for years on end now.  I've been told many times (by clients, professors, and employers) that considering my age, my skill set is remarkably impressive.<p>I'm very young though, so I have had very little startup experience (and very little ""corporate"" experience).  I don't want to get too far into details, simply because this is the internet, but I've taken everything mentioned here into account and will plan to do something.",1182279020

It's used to value just about everything, from startups to blue-chips to bonds to real estate.<p>You and PG are basically saying the same thing: NPV <i>is</i> the expected value of all future profits, discounted back to the present by the risk-free rate of return (normally taken to be the interest rate on T-bills).  You're assuming that profits will remain constant, though.  In most cases, this is not a valid assumption.  Even big companies like Coca Cola have some earnings growth factored into their stock prices.<p>There is, of course, risk in trying to predict future profits.  But there's also risk in assuming profits will remain constant (as I rudely found out when I invested in a stock with a P/E of 9, only to see it lose money the next quarter).  That's why financial analysts get paid big bucks.<p>The only company that's worth zero is a bankrupt one.  Sometimes not even then - many bankrupt companies still have a residual market cap because investors expect them to emerge from bankrupty and continue operating.",1182277242

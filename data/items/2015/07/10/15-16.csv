9864688,comment,9857094,9859653,0,0,kabdib,,,"Why be cynical? That&#x27;s engineering. Real engineering is about materials, cost and time (if you leave one of those out, you&#x27;re either doing research or just aimlessly puttering around ... maybe both :-) ). There are other dimensions, too. In the consumer market, engineering is also about the reliability that you want your customers to experience.<p>Companies that make console hardware want you to be happy; they&#x27;re not going to ship you a hunk of hardware that generates a Warranty Expired Interrupt at one-year-and-one-day because they want you to keep buying games and services. Having to buy a new console is a hassle. Maybe you&#x27;ll buy the competitor&#x27;s console instead, who knows?<p>On the other hand, console margins (and yes, generally they have margins these days and are not sold at a loss) are razor thin. There are knife-fights in meetings over three cent changes to components because at production scale those pennies rapidly turn into millions of dollars. You don&#x27;t make a console with a reliability of 20 years because it would cost way too much and be obsolete long before the failure curve started to inflect.<p>So you optimize the product lifetime for user expectation of value, how long you think the technology will remain relevant, what the market will bear, and a bunch of other things (chip sourcing, cost of manufacture, architectural headroom and so on). This involves hard-won experience, spreadsheets, testing, figuring out how vendors are lying to you, plane trips to godforsaken industrial parks, and fist-fights in hallways. It&#x27;s awesome :-)<p>Are there companies selling stuff that will break the moment the warranty is over, or earlier? Sure; they are betting that actually getting warranty service is so inconvenient that you won&#x27;t bother. On the other hand, having watched (from the outside!) the execution of a product-recall-scale warranty, I was impressed with the company&#x27;s professionalism, and it didn&#x27;t strike me as a company that didn&#x27;t care about repeat customers. It sucks on both sides for something like this to happen, but there&#x27;s very little cyncism involved.",1436543899

Without a certain minimal degree of luck, you would have no scientific progress.<p>The scientific method can be viewed as simply a method of filtering out the intuitions without utility and promoting those (if any) that have utility. It is a way to avoid <i>wasting</i> the good fortune of the intuition of forming useful hypothesis, and avoiding the waste demonstrably fruitless intuitions.<p>> some credit has to be given to those that are right<p>But vitalism is so vague as to be untestable, and justifies no useful models. &quot;Some (unspecified elements of) living things are not governed by physical law&quot; is indistinguishable in effect from &quot;We have not yet discovered the physical laws governing (some elements of) living things&quot;.",1436543861

I definitely think it is more common for a programmer to expect that if they make a substring, and never reference the original string again, only the substring would remain in memory after GC.  It is more intuitive. Without prior knowledge of the implementation, why would you expect a reference to a substring to hold the entire original string in memory?  I don&#x27;t think it is necessarily sloppy code to interpret the method this way when you do not know the underlying implementation.<p>The description in the Java 7 API for substring is &quot;Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.&quot;  That does not suggest any sharing with the parent string; it says &quot;new string&quot;.",1436543762

However, a curious complexity is evident in biological systems - it&#x27;s physics imbued with &#x27;meaning&#x27;. A cell that behaves one way instead of another will die. This is true from e. coli up to skin cells. I suspect this adds a lot of complexity to the ultimate &#x27;algorithm&#x27; of intelligence.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s probably prudent to stipulate whether the goal is to specify the <i>developmental</i> algorithm that gives rise to intelligence, or intelligence itself. The generating process might be a lot more simple than the finished product, in the same way that the output of a pseudorandom number generator is very complex in terms of entropy (but not kolmogorov complexity, I guess), but the generating algorithm is very simple. Or the Rado graph, which is sorta maximally complex in the sense that it contains all finite and countably infinite graphs as induced subgraphs, yet it has a simple generating scheme. As a last example, consider No Man&#x27;s Sky - relatively simple algorithm compared to the astonishing complexity of the worlds.<p>I do believe there is a relatively simple high-level description of neural development. But it&#x27;s curious how it&#x27;s relatively robust to genetic manipulations. I remember early in graduate school listening to a lecture about a particular mouse model for autism, caused by just one gene. The lecturer excitedly told us that it had a very high rate of behavioral manipulation - 75% or so. Not coming from a mouse-model background I was astonished that it was &#x27;only&#x27; 75%. What happens in the other 25% - the gene doesn&#x27;t just magically reappear, there are other compensatory mechanisms. What drives those? I suspect that&#x27;s the more abstract level of description that a simple algorithm might describe.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph</a>",1436543406

9864571,comment,9857250,9861744,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"As far as I am aware, the only useful application of the food energy hypothesis to practical obesity management are the recommendations that people increase their daily physical activity, do resistance training to build muscle mass (thereby raising resting metabolic rate), and eat specific foods that may increase resting metabolic rate.  Notable examples would be caffeinated black coffee and unsweetened tea, which provide nearly zero food energy while the caffeine temporarily boosts metabolism.  Compounds found in Capsicum peppers are suspected of temporarily increasing metabolic rate (though the effect diminishes as the body acquires tolerance).  The resveratrol in berries and grapes is also suspected of causing white adipose cells to temporarily become &quot;beige&quot;, where they mimic brown adipose cells.  That third recommendation is, in essence, to take [non-caloric, herbal] drugs to boost metabolism.<p>As you suggested, the element that makes it useless <i>for practical adiposity management</i> is the fact that human bodies adjust resting metabolic rates, psychological impulses to consume food, and psychological impulses to adjust physical activity levels in response to dietary intake.  One person drinks a sweetened beverage and starts bouncing off the walls for the next two hours, burning off that extra energy.  Another drinks an identical portion, then becomes lethargic and turns every last sugar molecule into stored lipids.  We don&#x27;t [yet] have a model that can predict a structured diet for a specific person that can reliably produce the desired effect.<p>The labels on food packages and the calorie counting websites get their numbers from nutritional assays, rather than <i>in vivo</i> measurements in actual humans.  The latter would be prohibitively expensive, would produce results that are far less precise, and offer foods suppliers no competitive advantage.<p>This is why diet plans that don&#x27;t require calorie counting are relatively popular.  People just want to follow a diet where they can consistently lose excess adipose tissue without either literally working their asses off for hours a day, or constantly suppressing the psychological impulse to eat more than is allowed by the plan.  Whatever other mechanisms may be in play, some diets work best for some people for just one reason: they can feel satiated and stop eating at a caloric intake level consistent with fat loss, without having to constantly do math during their day.",1436542963

This stuff is ultimately judged by the biases of whoever is reading your CV, and people vary a lot.<p>If an employer is particularly worried about employee staying for extended periods, your record will work against you and you won&#x27;t get that job, all else equal. But, that&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds.  Some employers value people with Math Degrees. Some prefer PHDs. Some don&#x27;t. Some employers don&#x27;t like autodidacts. etc. A 1.5 year average employment period is in that category of preferences. Different employers will treat it differently. Same applies to your time as a freelancer.<p>Long term, 1-2 year stints early in your career is not usually seen as indicative of anything later on. It&#x27;s common. So unless it is not causing you problems now, it probably won&#x27;t later on.<p>I don&#x27;t know how it looks when you get to 10X1.5 year jobs though. It would certainly make you an unusual candidate. I&#x27;ve never hired someone with that much experience so never seen these CVs.<p>The real &quot;problem&quot; cases are people with multiple < 1 year jobs. If your last 3 jobs were under one year, most employers will see that as <i>&quot;The last 3 people that hired him regretted it.&quot;</i> That doesn&#x27;t sound like your record though so like I said, don&#x27;t worry.<p>Also, just building your CV your whole life sounds like a drag. Staying at a job you dislike for years just to change your CV image is like taking a job you don&#x27;t want or doing a degree you hate for your CV, it&#x27;s unattractive as a lifestyle.

Whenever you want to share, you (not cloud) re-encrypt all the content keys for all people you want to share with. This can be pretty computationally expensive.\nThe way to solve this, mentioned in the article - proxy re-encryption. There are such algorithms which allow the cloud to re-encrypt data on your behalf, without knowing your keys. Compromised cloud would have only choice of executing or not executing re-encryption.<p>2. Same as (1).

But I would be worried about your time at BigCo, because it seems like you didn&#x27;t ask the right questions and understand the environment before you signed on.  That would make me wonder whether you understand how my team works well enough to know that it&#x27;s what you want.  Based on your history, you&#x27;ve now been in just about every situation out there, and are old enough that you should know what you want and how to ask the right questions during interviews.  So at this point I&#x27;m expecting that you&#x27;re going to commit to something long enough to see it through to completion, and I&#x27;m going to be asking you tough questions along those lines, mainly to be sure that you know what we&#x27;re doing, that you&#x27;re excited about it, and that you intend to finish.  If I did decide to hire you, I would probably be looking to structure your compensation around retention through the completion of whatever project I&#x27;m hiring for.  That said, there are positions where the ramp time is very low and I would basically assume you&#x27;re like a short-term contractor, and for those positions I wouldn&#x27;t care.  If you find one like that, it&#x27;s a low-risk opportunity for both sides.  The drawback for you is that those positions don&#x27;t always pay well and are often the first to be eliminated when business slows.<p>I guess that highlights for me the biggest problem: you&#x27;ve talked a little about what you&#x27;ve done, but nothing about what you want to do.  That kinda matters.  If you want to be an engineer, you need to prove that you can stick with something from concept to at least the first upgrade cycle (you&#x27;ll learn more from an upgrade cycle than you will from shipping ten products and then walking away from them each time).  That might be a year or it might be ten.  If you want to do operations, you need to complete projects and then stick around long enough to learn from what you did.  An in any case, hiring managers will want to see that you&#x27;ve shipped something, because that&#x27;s the only way to be sure that your work was good enough to use.  Repeated departure well before shipping (or completing an internal project, etc.) is a big red flag, much moreso than the length of your tenure.  And not staying in one place long enough to learn from past mistakes greatly reduces your value.  Again, it&#x27;s not the calendar time, it&#x27;s what you did and learned.",1436541661

9864418,comment,9863832,9863832,0,0,garyrob,,,"For me, the question addressed by the article isn&#x27;t even the interesting one. The author talks about &quot;intelligence&quot; as in how we process environmental information and perform reasoning tasks. From that perspective, it does seem obvious that some form of computer will one day be able to do it. I don&#x27;t really care if the algorithms for doing so are simple or complicated.<p>For me, the real question of interest is not about that kind of intelligence, but of &quot;awareness&quot;. Computers may process environmental information and perform all sorts of logical operations based on it. But there is zero reason to think that any computer has any awareness whatsoever. It has no experience. There is something it is like to experience the color yellow, as opposed to merely classifying observed light as being of a certain wavelength; no computer has begun, in any way, to make that leap.<p>It seems like a lot of people, including the author, don&#x27;t even notice that this is a question. They seem to assume that computer-like information processing is all that happens in a human mind, and that awareness itself doesn&#x27;t even exist as something to ponder. So they equate any doubt about whether a computer can do what we do as a form of vitalism.<p>But with just a little bit of introspection, the fact that there is something it is like to experience the color yellow, as opposed to classifying a visual stimulus as being of a certain wavelength, or logically classifying it as having the attribute of &quot;yellowness&quot;, is absolutely clear -- and absolutely fundamental to our existence as human beings (although many would assume that many other forms of life also have this basic ability to experience, if not the same ability to process information in computer-like ways).<p>This is why, for me, the Turing Test is orthogonal to the question of whether a machine is actually conscious. I have no problem imagining that a software system, even on hardware that is basically the same as what we have now but bigger and faster, will one day be able to pass the Turing Test. But that doesn&#x27;t prove it has any experience of the color yellow; it merely means it can mimic the output of an entity that does.",1436541658

I also don&#x27;t think that beginning researchers do this basic &quot;background&quot; check; they try to achieve &quot;vision&quot; (or &quot;intelligence&quot;) without a clear (and at least commonly accepted) definition of &quot;vision&quot; (or &quot;intelligence&quot;).<p>As I said above, I can see your point, but I wouldn&#x27;t do this in the scientific community.

You can learn and grow in these positions for a few months, but you look around and see stagnation in people who stay longer.  I also worked for a number of managers who had never been a manager before, for a CTO who hired someone 3 months a year to do a job that he otherwise insisted on doing (badly), and for someone with an MIS degree that often talked about having been taught to intentionally foster dishonest and manipulative relationships with his staff.<p>I&#x27;m hoping the new gig sticks for a while, but you have to give respect to someone who keeps trying.

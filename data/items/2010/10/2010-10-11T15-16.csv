Real-world problems are way harder than artificial ones because of their inherent accidental complexity, which you can't take away.  If a man devises a problem, another man can solve it.  If no man has devised it, however, are you intelligent enough to solve it?<p>EDIT: Hence, I would prefer/like to be ""street smart"" over ""mensa smart"" every time.",1286812734

I did the project and they loved it, got paid, and everyone lived happily ever after.<p>Just recently though, I started thinking to myself that if they had the problem and my software fixed it, there has to be other non-profits with the same problem that my software could help.<p>If I take the program, do some work on it to generalize it a bit (to make it more broadly applicable to others), and put a product site around it, would I be able to legally resell this?  Also, let's say I wanted to make it SaaS or cut a percentage off of registration fees or something, what options should I look into for charging?  Lastly, what are some other considerations here?<p>I'm currently working on another project that will take me a while to finish (started documenting at blog.spkto.us), but I figured I could have the event software ready to roll within a month, and maybe I should get that going first to generate a little extra income.<p>Thoughts?",1286812569

1780083,comment,1779812,1779812,0,0,luffy,,,"I'm currently working on several applications for WP7.  The development experience for WP7 is a million-billion times better than it was for past Windows Mobile operating systems.<p>- The emulator is snappy and you don't need to mess around with ActiveSync.<p>- I'm not a huge fan of the XAML (the Silverlight/WPF markup language), but that is not an issue. I put a XAML place holder element in place and add controls in C#<p>- The built in controls look great and are surprisingly functional.  I specifically thinking of the Panorama control - which allows application content to basically flow off screen.  Some may find that style of having content get cut off by the edge of the display off-putting, but its effective if that truncated content is limited to titles.<p>- putting XNA in there is great, mostly for familiarity's sake.  You still have to design for the phone differences (form factor, input, and library).  Porting games over from XBox live probably won't require an enormous app-rewrite.  Can't wait to see how this particular piece plays out.<p>The one drawback I can see has to do with Windows Phone store.  I'm not really sure what the story is there.  Is app distribution really limited to the store?  How about enterprise apps?<p>I don't have experience developing iPhone or Android apps, so I won't comment on whether or not WP7 is better in that department.",1286812503

Cite some for me.<p>I'm sure you are aware of them and if you had any actual contradictory position on this you would have mentioned it.<p>> You don't actually need to be a super genius to go into tech.<p>I'd say you need to be well above average in 'math IQ' to be useful programmer. When you combine a lower mean in math-like capability with a smaller standard deviation this significantly cuts down the percentage of women who'd be expected to cross that 'threshold'.<p>> Maybe to found a startup, though that's also a reach, but certainly not to go be a dev somewhere<p>Can you actually program competently? Cause I'm getting the vibe that you don't have much respect for the art.<p>> why this community tends to assume A) that the tech community is totally immune to societally constructed gender forces that have at some point affected pretty much everything else in the world<p>Because at it's heart, the nuts and bolts of tech work is not about social interaction, it is about you and the computer/system. At some level it doesn't matter whether you are an bipolar lesbian midget with major personal hygiene issues or a privileged WASP, the computer doesn't care - your program will either work or not. True geeks don't need to ask for anyone's permission, approval or assistance to get into the area - they just start learning and coding. Sure, this is 'back room' stuff but at the heart of most successful tech startups you will find a healthy 'inner geek' that respects results above contemporary social mores.<p>> What evidence? I'm very happy to evaluate the evidence objectively. But it seems so far that there's been very little evidence presented either way<p>I agree in that none of he individual arguments presented are knockout blows. But when you accumulate the maths vs language gap, the variance difference, a reasonable explanation for different attitudes to risk, the successes in previous male bastions (law/medicine) versus the individualistic/mathy tech - it starts to look a lot like mutually supporting evidence.<p>When it comes to the 'complicated and totally unfounded explanation based on evolution' I see it as stronger than the 'secret societal forces that nobody can seem to put there finger on that stops women from entering tech'. Your argument about fear makes some sense but it is just as easy to argue that founding an ambitious startup is actually irrational in terms life result pay-offs - even for men.<p>In general I think it is quite too fall into the trap of thinking of people as fundamentally more similar to ones self than they really are, and to explain away the differences as societal influence. Modelling the rest of the world as 'slightly different versions of me' certainly has power but also great inaccuracies. This particular article called 'Generalizing From One Example' was a real eye opener for me.<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/</a>",1286811167

Sometimes it's hard for us tech types and early adopters to appreciate ""normal"" usage of pretty much anything.<p>I go to the site and my initial thought is: too dark. In fact I saw an article on colour theory recently that explained why you should never use black. I can't find it at the moment. I'll add it if I do.<p>Another thought: some of the things loading on the site seemed to be a bit slow.<p>The home page says ""Make a party mix with your friends!"". Ok, that gives some idea of what the site is for but what problem is this solving?<p>I click on some of the mixes there but nothing seems to come up. What is it meant to be? Collections of Youtube videos? If you're having a party, how do you use such a mix? Most people will want to play such things through a stereo, probably through an iPod. Youtube videos require a computer (or an iPad or iPod Touch). Sound quality is typically worse. Bandwidth is an issue.<p>I can see why you chose Youtube as it's one of the very few ways of getting music on the internet but really for mass adoption something like this needs to integrate with iTunes or something else you can just play. Distribution of such content is going to be a huge problem. There was a post on HN in the last couple of weeks saying that music startups were basically dead. Legal barriers too high. Content owners stuck in the past that will simply bleed you dry.<p>The site suggests Facebook login. I guess to connect with your friends. But the mixes on the front page were public. So, as a user, I'm confused. Is this public or something I do with my friends or both? There's no clear message here.<p>What I think would need to drive this is high ranking on Google. This might take some research and possibly some AdWords. Things like ""80s party mix"". Themes like that.<p>Another big problem: Youtube allows you to create playlists on the site. What incentive and advantage is there to going somewhere else to compile this?<p>Music is a hard problem. Medieval content owners, iTunes being a closed ecosystem. It's tough.",1286811078

And it is because their semantics are such that there are huge returns from being able to display a lot of text at one time (they are not interactive, they are not concise). (Is this because of something inherent in programming, or is it because we tailor the language to be easily editable with keyboard/mouse? It is unclear.)<p>It would be interesting to see a language like APL on a tablet. The use of sigils leads to a very concise language, and the downside of sigils (lack of a specific keyboard for them), seems to be overcome on a tablet where you use the touch screen as a keyboard.<p>You could probably go further with it, tailoring a language and development environment specifically to the strengths of a tablet.

Sure, you can accumulate more if you don't spend (I actually sorta doubt it, but let's assume it for argument's sake).</i><p>I disagree. Once you've learned the basics of investing or stock trading, accumulating capital becomes about increasing your income.<p>Let's look at your laptop & apartment example.<p>Case 1: Super fast laptop & nice clean apartment. I can max out a Macbook Pro for about three grand, and a nice 2br apartment in Boston will cost about $3k per month in rent. With your $8,000 bank account, you'll need to earn at least $3,000 per month from your job just to pay for your apartment. More to save up and purchase that laptop, and even more still if you want to afford to eat.<p>Case 2: Crappy laptop and crappy apartment with $50k. A crappy laptop is about $500 for a really nice netbook, and a cheap apartment in Boston is about $600 per month (for those in Boston, think JP and Forest Hills). Let's invest that $50k in an ETF called ""PFF"", which currently costs $40 per share and pays a monthly dividend of, on average, .20c per share. That gives you 1250 shares of PFF, for an average monthly income of $250. With $50k, you can buy a $1000 laptop in four months, or pay for almost half your monthly rent.<p>On a forum where people are constantly trying to generate passive income through webapps and side businesses, I'm surprised people continuously overlook the passive income power of large amounts of capital. $50k can buy you $250 a month for life.",1286810346

Unfortunately, I only took one stats course in college, about 3 years ago, and my data mining course was worthless.<p>I'd really like to get into data analysis and data mining.  I do a fair amount of basic reporting right now, but it's nothing outside of basic select-and-display database reports.  For example, right now we have a report that shows client satisfaction reports.  I'd like to add some added functionality to it so that we can see some trends such as movers/shakers, if some customers are consistently returning negative feedback, or if the amount of notes left in a ticket has a bearing on the survey feedback.<p>I can't afford to go back to school at the moment, so I'm looking for ways I can bootstrap some basics into my work.  Can someone recommend some resources for this?

in every way, including for readability.<p>The example is trivial but instructive. Each line in the second version is arguably more readable (in isolation) than its counterpart in the first, yet the verbose version as a whole imposes a longer time-to-comprehension on the reader  especially if you allow for the ability to grok idioms at a glance that one inevitably acquires after working with a given language or system for some time.<p>In my experience this argument becomes increasingly compelling as one applies it to more complex programs. What the naive notion of ""readability"" fails to account for is the compounding complexity tax of verbosity. It's a bit like analyzing the profitability of a trading system without considering transaction costs.<p>One more thing, with apologies for this being patronizing: an infatuation with an explicit spell-everything-out standard of readability seems to be a rite of passage on the path to programming maturity. I certainly went through it. I remember laughing uproariously at some of P.J. Plauger's (very tight and regular) library code years ago.

Yahoo's reputation, at least in the eye of the public, largely consists of being a failed competitor to google, a has-been. Hiring Marissa Mayer certainly got the tech world excited, but I'm not sure that excitement spread far beyond those who were already familiar with her in the context of her work at google.<p>This acquisition answers the skeptical question I think many of us were asking ourselves: how will yahoo shed its reputation as a has-been and get people to give it a second chance? This is how. This says ""we're young and exciting again"" more effectively than a high-budget series of TV ads and billboards ever could. Maybe it doesn't send quite that message to the jaded startup crowd, but it certainly sends it to the tech bloggers and interested bystanders, who are the people yahoo is after in the first place. The message is even stronger because of the timing with respect to google reader. I haven't yet decided weather or not I want to believe that it was planned all along.<p>My intent is not to diminish Nick's accomplishment, although in the name of full disclosure I freely admit jealousy (who wouldn't?). I'd categorize it under both deserving and lucky, with the proviso that ""deserving and unlucky"" is a rather large category. Good job, Nick, although you certainly don't need to hear it from me :)<p>I still have to reserve my loudest (virtual) applause for yahoo.

The coding project is very easy. Any experienced programmer would be able to solve it in about an hour. We tell the candidates to solve the problem in any programming language and that the goal is to show off problem solving, testing and design skills.<p>Once we've received the code, we review it for the above stated qualities with an emphasis on clean, readable and well-tested code. We're not too hard on these code reviews, we just want to try to eliminate obviously poor fits. People who write no tests are immediately eliminated. Hugely over-architected solution? Eliminated. Code is bad enough the person might not actual be able to program? You get the idea.<p>Once the person has passed this stage, they come in for an in-person interview. They are asked to bring their laptop. When they arrive, the dev manager will show the candidate to the room where they will be interviewed, talk a bit and then come get two developers for a coding interview.<p>The coding interview is somewhat on a per-candidate basis, but fundamentally the two interviewers will review the code beforehand and find places for improvement. Improvements might be refactorings to make the code cleaner or new features if the code is particularly well-written. We first have the candidate give us a code walk-through and explain what's happening, thought processes, etc. Then one of the interviewers will pair with the candidate for a while and switch out with the other interviewer after a while.<p>The whole process thus far is an attempt to, as closely as possible, simulate what it would be like to work with this person on a real task. No writing quick sort on the white board. Writing code, at a computer, with an IDE as a pair. Google stuff, whatever your normal workflow is. We just want to know what it's like to work with you.<p>After the pairing part of the interview, we do a more informal group interview with the rest of the team. We're currently 7 people counting the development manager, a scrummaster/QA and a PM/QA. So the group isn't too big. This is an opportunity for more high-level and philosophical questions. ""Why do you want to work here?"", ""Anything in particular you dislike about Java?"". Maybe if they're more senior, I'll have them explain OOP to our designer to see how well they can mentor. At the end of this section, we open it up for questions from the candidate.<p>So far we've had particularly good success with 1) not wasting our time with people who can't code, can't test their code or are poor at designing the structure of their code; 2) finding good cultural fits - if someone doesn't like pair programming or TDD, we'll be able to figure that out as part of the interview; 3) not arbitrarily eliminating people because they didn't study their CS textbook ahead of time or aren't comfortable writing syntactically correct code on a whiteboard.",1364269511

We have been working really hard and just got all 4 wheels attached to our sculpture yesterday. What we need now are two steel framed mountain bikes in good condition. We haven't been able to find anything within our budget on Craigslist (really rural area) and I have decided that we should just buy them. There is a local store that has exactly what we need for $100 apiece, but our team just doesn't  have the money. We are a sort of under-the-radar club at our school, organized as a community service project. During the race, we raise money for a local homeless charity. Unfortunately, during the offseason, money really dries up. I have taken it upon myself to raise the money and I figure we will need around $250 in total for the two bikes and tax.<p>I am coming here because I know how good y'all are at fundraising and finding what South Park would call ""internet money"".

Pressure is obviously applied to the mechanism in either case. Each mechanism also uses springs to propel the blade outwards. The distinction is between whether you are operating a lever or (what amounts to) a wedge.<p>In the switchblade, the button is releasing a wedge of some sort that is preventing the blade from then swinging out entirely due to the force of the spring. In the spring-assisted model, a spring is also present to propel the blade, but there is not enough tension for the blade to release on its own. Instead, the user must torque a lever a certain radial distance before the spring's force is sufficient to finish propelling the blade, hence the term ""assisted.""<p>In terms of time-to-readiness, this might not be a big difference. But I was always under the impression that switchblades was supposed to refer to spring-operated ""plunging"" type knives, where the blade is concealed in a chamber before being propelled outward by the spring, requiring only a click of a button rather than a slashing movement on the part of the operator to cause harm.",1364268384

I'd say it's not the fundamental thing to understand about FP: you can even program in a functional way without using them.<p>And also you can have languages which aren't putting the emphasis on FP at all and yet who have higher-order functions: elisp, for example (anyone calling elisp functional is automatically setq'ed to crazy ; )<p>IMHO Lisp dialects aren't inherently functionals. Some are, some aren't. Even Clojure, which definitely puts the emphasis on FP, isn't purely functional, far from it.  But you can use it in a functional way (and Java too, in a way -- I used to do ""OO over immutable objects"" and use ""functional Java"").<p>However you'll probably find that when using Lisps in a functional way, you can use higher-order function often.  For example if you have, say, a referentially transparent function and want to add memoization for free then it's very convenient to simply (memoize myfunc).<p>Or if you want to ""carry the state"" of your program through monads (or to use other kind of monads): then you'll need higher-order functions.<p>To me if there is one thing about FP it is simply idempotent / referentially transparent functions which make it easier to reason about the program.<p>I'm simply beginning to ""grok"" FP, HoFs and Clojure so take this with a grain of salt : )",1364268355

Like standard Play/Pause/Volume big at the center ( bottom or top )<p>- You need a colorful/media Logo, definitely.<p>For later maybe : Like Spotify and others, being able to create & share playlist of videos, ranking them, etc. and NOT only by artist. Let's say I'm at a party, and I made a nice music video playlist at home, I just connect thru facebook, and I can play my playlist, etc. Youtube is crap for that, and that's EXACTLY the kind of ""share tool"" you would need I guess.<p>- Being able to easily vote for music videos ( just a click, no more ) and that would help then to provide the user with the best videos first (and kick out the image music videos from the first of the search results).<p>I don't really have much free time, but could give you a hand.

I'm normally based on the West Coast of the US.<p>Visit manufacturers in the US (or other developed countries) to study how they do it. Then, go to China and evaluate the factories yourself. You have to see the factory.<p>If you don't, many times you won't discover that the ""manufacturer"" you're working with is nothing more than a trading company, taking a cut.<p>They won't take you as seriously if you don't show up.<p>You should make follow-up visits afterward to monitor QC. Have rigorous QC methods and standards, and agree to them beforehand.<p>Also, consider countries such as South Korea, which are more sophisticated manufacturers than China currently but still offer significant cost savings. It depends on the complexity of your product but it may make sense. Labor is much more expensive in Korea though compared to China.<p>I can answer any other specific questions people have.",1288091499

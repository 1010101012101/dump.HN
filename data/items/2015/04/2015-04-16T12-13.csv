It&#x27;s really just inattentiveness that causes drivers to hit cyclists, and a lack of awareness of cyclists in general.

Pharo is too cool and too well designed for mainstream. Pharo also is going towards a complete opposite direction of sacrificing features over ease of usage.<p>So in the end Pharo is not designed for the mainstream developer its designed for the developer that looks for something radical diffirent.<p>But diffirence comes with a cost, it means that you get out your comfort zone, explaining basic concepts takes much more time and effort because of lack of familiarity etc etc.<p>So if you dont understand Pharo at first try, thats not a bug thats a feature. If you do understand Pharo at second try that&#x27;s a bug.<p>Some people refer to pharo as &quot;the red pill&quot; of coding, taking the red pill has its advantages but also significant disadvantages. The choice in the end is yours.<p>Sure documentation and website can be improved but it wont solve the problem that Pharo is outside mainstream way of doing coding because this is what makes Pharo so fun to work with :)",1429188964

This means samples take a long time to move through layers, and as these delays accumulate you end up with fairly big and definitely noticeable audio latencies.<p>This is obviously an issue when doing real-time audio processing or generation: if you&#x27;re using virtual instruments and the feedback to your cans is 1/10th of a second behind the interaction it&#x27;s unusable.<p>But it&#x27;s also a problem for more mundane applications: a 200ms roundtrip (100ms to move samples from the mic to the application on the talker&#x27;s side, and 100ms to move them from the application to the speaker on the listener&#x27;s side) is is more delay than the transmission time from somebody literally on the other side of the earth.

And, given a trend, you can&#x27;t just pick two points and say they should be so far apart. The only way that would work is if all the data points were very close to the trendline. And the only way that would happen is if CPU development happened very smoothly; which it doesn&#x27;t. You have spurts of performance increase as new architectures are released.<p>The only thing I was showing with those two figures was that it&#x27;s clearly not true that speed stopped increasing in 2005. If you want to show there&#x27;s a different trend, then you need multiple data points and compare the recent trend with the longer term trend to see if they&#x27;re significantly different.",1429188913

9387574,comment,9387220,9387220,0,0,jvehent,,,"Netflix can serve up to 40Gbps of traffic per server in cleartext HTTP. Their initial test of adding TLS induced a performance cut of ~3x, which has huge cost impact to their infrastructure. This is due to sendfile(), a kernel syscall used by nginx, not being available when data needs to be encrypted by TLS in userland.<p>Netflix really needs sendfile() to work with TLS to enable HTTPS on all of its traffic, so they added some limited crypto support to the BSD kernel. What that paper really demonstrates is the need for a TLS stack in the kernel that can let userspace daemons benefit from low-level optimizations. I, for one, would love to see something like this added to the linux kernel!<p>This is great work from Netflix. They could have just said &quot;screw it, it&#x27;s too hard/expensive, we&#x27;ll do HTTP&quot;.

I was a using windows 98 and ASIO was still mostly a Steinberg only development and I couldn&#x27;t afford cubase. I got a hand me down version of cakewalk pro audio 8. I remember the latency of that set up was about 35ms and thinking this is pretty good. There was some degree of having to start playing just slightly early so you could stay on time. With guitar and keys this was doable but I&#x27;m sure it would have been maddening with drums. I think it was when fl studio 3 came out that I had the first &quot;daw&quot; that supported ASIO. I remember being blown away at how much tighter everything sounded from that point on.<p>For those interested in why iOS is better than android, a good summary would just be to say Core Audio was designed from the ground up to be a low level low latency audio API. There are fewer layers in it vs android. When designing OS X Apple knew they had a large professional media market so that got priority.

Having a high heart rate that you can sustain is, in my experience, actually good for endurance sports.  In fact, my father pointed out the other day that he just can&#x27;t get his heart rate up any more (he&#x27;s 73 and still rides his bike over mountains).  This means he can&#x27;t get enough oxygen into his muscles to keep a high pace.  As I&#x27;ve grown older, I&#x27;ve also noticed this ceiling that is limited by how high I can sustain my heart rate and for how long.<p>So, rather than assume that your observation is the problem, I think perhaps you might have something you can work with, whatever your underlying problem actually is.  I&#x27;ve done sports my whole life (running, a small bit of weight lifting, karate, and now cycling).  Especially now that I&#x27;m getting older, I need to concentrate on &quot;base miles&quot; on my bike.  This means going out at a very slow pace (annoyingly so, for me) and riding for very long time.  Cycling is good for this as it is relatively easy to dial the pace to whatever you need -- just make sure to have a lot of low gears if you tend to have problems.<p>I suspect that if you ride a bike at a very slow pace for an hour a day for about 6 months that you will find a really marked difference in your ability to exercise.  Keep your pace so that you could have a conversation easily and that you aren&#x27;t out of breath.  If you run into difficult situations (hills, wind, whatever), just go into a lower gear.  You may need to go to a bike shop to get especially low gears, but it won&#x27;t be outrageously expensive.<p>Hope that helps.",1429187707

In fact, some studies have shown that giving poor kids computers actually makes things worse [1]. I certainly don&#x27;t think that we should keep computers away from poor kids, but we need to think carefully about how to maximize the social value of the money spent on these programs.<p>As an example, I have lived with at least one computer my entire life (that I can remember), starting with a Commodore 64. My parents encouraged me to explore, and my dad helped me learn BASIC when I was 9 or 10 (I may have given up without his assistance). The computer was important, but so were my parents. One without the other would have created a very different outcome for me.<p>Parents of disadvantaged children are less likely to have the time, knowledge, or energy to provide the motivation and assistance to help their children benefit from having a computer. So then, how much social value are we getting when we drop $500 or $1,000 (or more, with support costs) and hand a disadvantaged kid an iPad or a laptop?<p>In my view, having worked in academic technology, albeit at the college level, we would get better results by providing an excellent technology curriculum, taught by competent teachers, with a low-pressure, low-risk environment (AP Computer Science doesn&#x27;t work here because disadvantaged kids don&#x27;t take AP classes). The cost would be about the same, or even less, but in exchange for the money we could get both pieces of the puzzle, hardware (computer labs, imagine in-school hacker spaces), <i>and</i> the knowledge and direction to actually make something of it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w16078"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nber.org/papers/w16078</a>",1429187563

The Perceptual Dialectology of California<p><a href=""http://eng.sagepub.com/content/35/4/325.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eng.sagepub.com/content/35/4/325.abstract</a><p><a href=""http://people.duke.edu/~eec10/hellanorcal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.duke.edu/~eec10/hellanorcal.pdf</a><p>This study provides the first detailed account of perceptual dialectology within California (as well as one of the first accounts of perceptual dialectology within any single state). Quantitative analysis of a map-labeling task carried out in Southern California reveals that California&#x27;s most salient linguistic boundary is between the northern and southern regions of the state. Whereas studies of the perceptual dialectology of the United States as a whole have focused almost exclusively on regional dialect differences, respondents associated particular regions of California less with distinctive dialects than with differences in language (English versus Spanish), slang use, and social groups. The diverse sociolinguistic situation of California is reflected in the emphasis both on highly salient social groups thought to be stereotypical of California by residents and nonresidents alike (e.g., surfers) and on groups that, though prominent in the cultural landscape of the state, remain largely unrecognized by outsiders (e.g., hicks).<p>[...]<p>By far, the most frequently remarked-upon slang term in the map-labeling data
was hella, accounting for 47.4 percent of the slang and other lexical labels. Hella is
a slang term originating in Northern California and one that remains—aside from a
few brief moments in the national spotlight due to its circulation in popular culture—
largely restricted to that region (Bucholtz 2006). The term, which apparently lexicalized
from (a) hell of (a), functions as both a quantifier (There were hella people
there) and an intensifier (He runs hella fast). Four respondents also mentioned the
slang term hecka, the G-rated equivalent of hella, but this term was not counted
separately, because tokens of hecka always co-occurred with hella.
For Southern Californians in particular, hella represents a crucial shibboleth separating
the two major regions of the state. As shown in Figure 7, respondents tended
to identify hella overwhelmingly as a Northern California slang term, and its appearance
in other regions of the map drops dramatically from north to south.
Thus Northern California was variously labeled the hellas, Land of the Hella’s,
and Hella capital, and one respondent provided an isogloss designating “the ‘hella’
line.” (In the map data, the Central Coast around Santa Barbara seemed to be the
dividing line between users and nonusers of hella, and the fact that the study was
conducted in this region may have enhanced respondents’ focus on this particular
issue.) [*10: The respondent’s confusion may also be due to the existence of the Crips, a notorious Los
Angeles–based gang.] Hella users were also negatively evaluated by Southern Californians, and
the term came in for a good deal of criticism, such as Hella is not a real word and
[hecka is] probably the worst word ever.",1429186644

We’re writing to inform you that a project you backed, Goblins: Alternate Realities, is the subject of an intellectual property dispute.<p>This is so odd, since they’ve told me repeatedly, that they absolutely cannot send messages out to all the backers. And yet… here’s a message sent to all the backers. Weird. I’m thinking wizards from the future? Maybe it was Ultron and his super high tech?<p>The law requires that we remove the project from public view until the dispute is resolved (please see our Copyright Policy and Trademark Policy for more info). Because the project already ended successfully, your pledge hasn’t been affected. The creator should still be able to move forward with the project (and send any unfulfilled rewards).<p>Really?! Really. I mean… seriously? Kickstarter is vastly informed with the current situation. They KNOW that Richard (the creator) stole the money and ran. They KNOW that he is not making G:AR under any circumstances. I have asked them over and over, if they’d send a blanket email to all my backers, telling them that G:AR is not being made. And here they are emailing all the backers to tell them that it WILL be made and assuring the backers that they WILL get their rewards! You have got to be kidding me. You have got to be fucking kidding me.<p>Thanks again, Kickstarter! Thanks for screwing me over just a little bit more! Now I’ve got a tsunami of emails from people thinking that they’re going to be getting their rewards. I mean, why wouldn’t they think that? Kickstarter just personally told them it would happen. Now it’s my word against Kickstarter’s. I didn’t think it possible, but Kickstarter has made this situation so, so much worse.<p>Kickstarter… you suck. You’re horrible and/or incompetent people that HAVE to be doing this on purpose. I can’t think of any other reason for this level of ineptitude.<p>If you have any questions, though, you can still message the creator from the project page.<p>And finally, we have the climax of this stupidity. Sure. message the creator. Nevermind that Richard stopped responding to all of those messages a loooong time ago. No, no. Please. Please feel free to contact the creator via the link kindly provided by Kickstarter. After all, Kickstarter did just assure you that “you can STILL message the creator“.<p>Thanks for your patience and cooperation,

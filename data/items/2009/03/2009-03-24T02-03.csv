Because of the crazed iPhone goldrush that's going on, there's a lot less community sharing than you'd expect -- everyone's trying to get an edge on the other 80000000 apps, so they're keeping their cards close.<p>This is a great step in the other direction.

She was skeptical at first but is now quite pleased.  If all movies were available this way, I think she'd forgo renting DVDs.  Quality isn't as good as Blu-Ray, but it's better than an old-school DVD.<p>How can Blockbuster compete against Netflix when its business model is based on the retail distribution of physical goods?  Netflix is working hard to cannibalize its dvd-by-mail business and will end up with a much higher margin business as a result.<p>IIRC, a few years ago, Blockbuster was telling investors that consumers loved the experience of going to the video store to pick out rentals!  Don't worry, nothing's rotten here folks.<p>BTW, the Roku works really well.  Other than its screwy menu scheme (ok once you readjust your assumptions), it's a beautiful simple device.",1237863395

If you chose, say, mountain biking, it wouldn't be that hard to get some endorsement from whomever the mountain biking celebrity du-jour is.  In niche fields like this the top guys are pretty accessible.<p>Mountain biking has a solid fan base, worldwide, and the guys that are into it aren't afraid of spending several thousand on a bike, plus all the bits and pieces that go with it. They're also generally young, single and male, which dovetails nicely with an internet demographic.  After all, you can't go out at night. That means there's ad dollar to be made. There's also a vast amount of technical know-how that goes into the sport, both from a how-to setup your bike, how-to do particular techniques, and where to go.  A lot of this is currently buried in forums with crappy interfaces and broken searches.<p>A niche area like this isn't going to get you bought for 10 million, but a couple of talented guys could make a nice living doing something they love, which isn't to be sneezed at.<p>There are so many other niches that spring to mind crying out for a better problem-solving model than forum postings, which is really what SO is.

Isn't the value-add here that I get SysOps and all that for free with GAE? Isn't the cost-savings of GAE coming from its scale, and if so, how could a private AppScale cloud running on Eucalyptus or similar garner the economies of scale to make it cheap enough to be viable?

The only benefit it offers is remembering the position of your window before you maximized. That same functionality could be captured by simply keeping a history of all resize operations and having ""restore"" step back through the history. This would be far more intuitive and more powerful.<p>For more info about tiling and utilities that let you do it in Windows:

529617,comment,529352,529352,0,0,azanar,,,"Home ownership strikes me as just a symptom of another more fundamental sacrosanct value in society, that of stability and security.<p>The author alludes to that in the article, but I think he needs to play it up more. For many people, <i>this</i> seems the real default, and buying a home is just outward evidence of that. Buying a home is a statement of commitment, that you will be there for at least as long as needed to make up the closing costs and what-have-you. Whether the house is just a byproduct of that attitude, or meant to directly project it, I don't know. But I don't think that everyone should make that sort of commitment, or that we should disproportionately laud those that do.<p>This is not a critique against people who desire security and stability, this is a critique against the attitude that you <i>must</i> be secure and stable to be worthy. I've seen it make a lot of people around me become depressed, because they simultaneously desire a more interesting life but fear being branded as flighty and irresponsible. Maybe this is their own problem, for being unable to reason their way out of this internal battle, but it is ubiquitous enough that it indicates a more fundamental brokenness.<p>I also wonder about the reported psychological benefits the author mentions. I wonder how much of this is induced by the belief that home ownership is meant to make you happy. If it doesn't then there is something wrong with you, not with your decision to buy. Not that there aren't happy homeowners, but that there <i>are</i> unhappy ones. It's the same with a lot of defaults; everyone else seems happy enough with them, why aren't you? Perhaps one of the biggest defaults, and the one that drives a lot of this, is the belief that those who follow the defaults are happier deeper than the image they project.",1237862828

529583,comment,527363,529519,0,0,Lightbody,,,"Moe,<p>Not sure if you noticed, but <i>I</i> was the author of that link :P<p>It's not just about incremental search, that's just one example. Anything in which there is logic in the client that reads in user-entered data and mutates it in a way in which simulating at the protocol level becomes non-trivial and effectively require duplicating the logic that was first written in JavaScript.<p>For another example: I'm working with a large online invitation website that is doing a big redesign of their site. The new UI is effectively one ""page"" and everything is done via AJAX calls to a JSON service layer, including login. Authentication to that service layer is done via a custom HTTP header that is a SHA encoding of the username + password + timestamp (among other things). If you wanted to test with 1000's of user accounts with traditional load testing, you end up needing to do the SHA encoding on the fly in whatever tool you're using (VBScript, LoadRunner's crazy C-like language, etc).<p>I really just can't think of a UI that would allow you easily record a Google search for one term and then abstract the test out to work with N search terms. Because the AJAX requests become data dependent (""foo"" causes 3 requests, ""foobar"" causes 6), you ultimately end up writing control structures (loops, branches, etc) that are better off written in a programming language. Generally, if the browser isn't doing simple ""passthrough"" of the user data, I find protocol simulation becomes much more difficult.<p>For these reasons, I'm not sure it's just a UI design issue, though I'd love to be proven wrong. Unless there was an Iterate-over-characters-of-data-X-and-issue-http-requests-with-pattern-Y command as well as a SHA-encode-data-X-and-data-Y command (which of course is way too domain specific), you'll likely end up writing your tests with a Real Programming Language.<p>As for your questions about data parameterization/randomization, that was the entire point of my article. I specifically called attention to data randomization as the point where it really gets tough. That's what load testing is all about, and that's why traditional approaches are breaking down.<p>BrowserMob lets you import a Selenium script that has static data in it (ie: ""type q google_search""). The script is converted to a JavaScript, which you can then edit and replace the data (ie: ""google_search"") with a random/parameterized data. The ensuing AJAX HTTP requests are generated automatically and correctly since the browser owns that.<p>All of that kind of stuff ultimately still has to get done with some scripting. I don't pretend that BrowserMob load testing is ""script free"". Far from it - we embrace JavaScript as the way to get things done. But if you're scripting a browser, your scripts end up dealing with user behavior emulation, which is almost always simpler than protocol layer emulation.<p>Understand: I'm not saying this stuff is impossible today. I'm saying it's harder than it needs to be and can be greatly simplified by just using a real browser.<p>All that said, I appreciate your frustration with the lack of tools. I hope you'll give our approach a closer look. I'd certainly appreciate hands-on feedback. We do offer more traditional virtual user scripting support as well (at 1/10th the price of our real browser service), so if you're good with JavaScript you can get some pretty affordable on-demand testing!<p>Patrick",1237860582

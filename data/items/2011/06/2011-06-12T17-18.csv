2646965,comment,2646439,2646947,1,0,plinkplonk,,,"If the existence of working software is validation for a methodology, then plenty of first class software has been and is being written every day <i>without</i> ""TDD"" of any kind. By your logic that should validate the idea that lack of TDD is helpful.<p>All I am saying is that extraordinary claims require strong evidence.<p>also you quote selectively . Norvig goes on to say<p><i>""But you can test all you want and if you dont know how to approach the problem, youre not going to get a solution.""</i><p>Hardly the ringing endorsement of TDD that you imply. Besides the original article contrasted Norvig's algorithmic insight based approach to Jeffries's  
""write tests to try to improve understanding"" approach( (at which he fails miserably btw).<p><i>In the very article you link to Seibel goes on to say</i>  (emphasis mine)<p>""But he (Jeffries) did choose to tackle this particular problem using TDD, a technique in which he is supposed to be the expert? Why did he have so little success?<p>One thing I noticed, reading through Jeffriess blog posts, was that he got fixated on the problem of how to represent a Sudoku board. He immediately started writing tests of the low-level details of a few functions for manipulating a data structure representing the 99 Sudoku board and a few functions for getting at the rows, columns, and boxes of the board. (Boxes are what Sudoku players call the 33 squares subsquares of the 99 board.)<p>Then he basically wandered around for the rest of his five blog postings fiddling with the representation, making it more object oriented and then fixing up the tests to work with the new representation and so on until eventually, it seems, he just got bored and gave up, having made only one minor stab at the problem of actually solving puzzles.<p>I suspect, having done a small amount of TDD myself, that <i>this is actually a pattern that arises when a programmer tries to apply TDD to a problem they just dont know how to solve</i>.<p>If I was a high-priced consultant/trainer like Jeffries, Id probably give this pattern a pithy name like <i>Going in Circles Means You Dont Know What Youre Doing</i>. Because he had no idea how to tackle the real problem, the only kinds of tests he could think of were either the very high-level the program works kind which were obviously too much of a leap or low-level tests of nitty-gritty code that is necessary but not at all sufficient for a working solver.""<p>Hmm that doesn't sound like an example of ""tdd is a way to deeply understand a domain"". Sounds more like ""if you are clueless, TDD leads you in circles"".<p>That isn't to say that TDD may not help in specific instances. But hey, paper and pencil, or reading up on the domain, or building a non TDD prototype are likely be much better.<p>So if you claim that TDD improves domain understanding in any substantial fashion you need stronger evidence or logical reasoning than a truncated selective quote from an article that claims the exact opposite.<p>All that said, if TDD is your favorite method of sw dev, good for you. I just find claims about it  being a tool to ""deeply understand the domain"" somewhat dubious. Any but the most  trivial domains need more than ""TDD"" to understand (imo).<p>YMMV.

It adds up to a hidden tax because you endure an ongoing lag against progress and wasting money on hardware you can't fully exploit. You may as well buy proprietary OS and software with all the money you can save by buying new-generation Windows-certified hardware, and money can earn by not spending 10 hours a week trying to fix you machine.<p>Fighting for freedom is noble, but it's a martyr's calling.
It's hard to be so in love with technology, while at the same time never getting to enjoy using it. It's sadomasochism.<p>This goes for the desktop.

2646917,comment,2644364,2646305,1,0,nxn,,,"To clarify:<p>HTML5+JS is only suitable as a replacement to the presentation portions of .NET (so WPF or WinForms), which are just a small portion of everything that .NET is. Think of .NET as being a Humvee and HTML5 and JS as a motorcycle, and developing your application as going to some remote location in Alaska -- while the motorcycle will look great, it will only get you so far, and you need something more for the rest of the road that can also carry a motorcycle if need be.<p>JS is a language that primarily lives in the browser and doesn't come with anything that would allow you to access much of the computer it is running on. We're talking about applications that will be executing natively here, so things like access to the file system are a must. You can of course try to use something that implements the CommonJS spec, like NodeJS, but are you honestly going to throw out the massive amount of libraries Microsoft created for doing IO, database connectivity, concurrency, networking, and a whole lot more, for something as minimalistic as an implementation of the CommonJS spec?<p>There are other problems on top of this. People say JavaScript is ""fast"", and it's true when compared to JavaScript a few years ago, but it is not true when compared to most .NET languages. Objects essentially being associative arrays in JavaScript means accessing a value that is deeply nested in a hierarchy of objects is slow. While even a problem now, it would get much much worse if you were to throw in the large number of libraries needed to make HTML5 and JS into a general application development framework. Stuff like: Com.Company.Project.Class.Member.Member.Method(); simply takes too much time in JavaScript. Same story for deep inheritance chains you often see in desktop apps.<p>Another problem: If your whole application is going to be in HTML5+JS, your whole application's source code is going to be public. You can try obfuscation, but I personally wouldn't put much faith into that approach.<p>.NET was built from the ground up as a whole application development framework -- it does this well. While HTML5+JS overlap with .NET in some areas, their scopes are still much smaller in comparison, and are therefore not suitable as complete replacements to .NET.",1307900270

2646843,comment,2646001,2646741,0,0,yaix,,,"Agreed.<p>However, we have learned to not abuse freedom for selfish profit, but to maintain and protect it. We learned that freedom is the freedom of speech for others. And to accept conflicting opinions peacefully.<p>This is not a given everywhere, though. Where Social Capital is lacking, freedom can easily become a trigger for a breakdown of personal and public security. Where loyalties are mainly based on family ties or group boundaries, freedom can easily lead to more hate and large scale physical violence. Where education is poor, even the most obvious lie will find people that get angry about it and look for ""retaliation"", often physical.<p>I am of course not saying that freedom of speech is bad. On the contrary. But is has to be dealed with carefully, and differently in differend societies, taking into account each societies values and development process. Otherwise it may easily (again!) destroy more than it creates. Just think of the ""elections"" desaster in Africa in the 1990s. A huge (and forseable) tragedy, but it sold well in the West.",1307898749

In Python, that something is OO.<p>OO broadly means the base abstraction of the language syntax and base libraries is classes and objects. That's Python.

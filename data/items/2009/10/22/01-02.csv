896052,comment,894672,895823,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Also you're unable to show the code to a programmer unfamiliar with the syntax, without having to explain each character.</i><p>Yeah, well, you're also unable to show French to an English speaker without having to explain the grammar rules and define each word.  To use a language, you have to learn it.  To read a language, you have to learn it.  (Reading is the harder of the two.  When you are programming or speaking, you can say things the way you want to.  When you are reading or listening, you have to understand the other person's way of speaking.)<p><i>Less tokens to say something != always better</i><p>I definitely agree with you there.  Regular expressions are a good example of this -- way too much optimization for typeability at the expense of readability.  It is much easier to read an expression when you have a little bit more verbosity; in the regex domain there are things like rx (Emacs Lisp) or Parsec / PArrows (Haskell).  Easy to read, not too hard to write (is ""\w+"" much harder to type than ""(many words)""?  no.)<p>But it is also possible to be too verbose.  If you just want to say:<p><pre><code>    my @sorted = sort (length $a <=> length $b) @list\n</code></pre>\nyou really don't want to have to write:<p><pre><code>   // file SortableByLength.java\n   public interface SortableByLength implements Sortable, HasLength {}\n\n   // your app code\n   List sorted;\n   Sorter sorter = new Sorter<SortableByLength>();\n   sorted = sorter.customSort( list,\n       new SortFunction {\n           public Ordering compare(SortableByLength a, SortableByLength b){\n               return a.length().compareTo(b.length());\n           };\n       }\n    );\n</code></pre>\nBy the time you have written that, you have forgotten what you were actually trying to program.  (Upon proofreading this, I realize that the sorters could all be specialized to a concrete type, and that would save a bit of typing.  But when you factor out the anonymous class, you will want it to be generic.)<p>It also worth noting that the extra typing there is not to get type safety; I can get the same type safety with a lot less typing in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    sorted = sortBy f list\n         where f :: (HasLength a, Sortable a) => a -> a -> Ordering\n               f x y = compare (length x) (length y)</code></pre>",1256176073

The C++ code contains a lot of cruft like explicit handling of ping/pong/pang and a http handler with some html snippets, which the new code doesn't have. I removed the cruft and result sloc is 105 vs 302 (still include all the boilerplate stuff: includes/namespace, the quite verbose asio server setup that can be refactored, and the line wasteful brace usage.)<p>The erlang code is also much denser. I gziped the code to compare a fairer symbol count: it's 1535b vs 2916b, a 47% saving, not bad but not that impressive either, considering the refactoring in the new code.<p>From user's point of view, the new distribution is 4x larger (10MB vs 2.5MB) and uses much more memory, which is a bad deal.

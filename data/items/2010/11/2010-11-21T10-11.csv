1926869,comment,1926047,1926354,0,0,_delirium,,,"> I would really like to bring the Whole Earth Catalog hacking tradition full circle.<p>Sort of a tangent, but the Whole Earth Catalog scene and the tech scene were surprisingly inter-related in the 60s-80s, which is something I didn't know until recently. Ted Nelson, who had coined the word ""hypertext"" about three years before the first WEC was published, was greatly influenced by it for his 1974 book <i>Computer Lib / Dream Machines</i>, and Steve Jobs was an avid reader as well. There was even briefly a software version in the 80s: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_and_Review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_an...</a><p>I think I was surprised to find a connection mainly because in 2010 I associate the Whole Earth Catalog more with anti-technology primitivists, which doesn't seem to have originally been the case--- seems plenty of technologists were also interested in it, since DIY doesn't <i>have</i> to mean primitivism.",1290337161

1926865,comment,1926515,1926515,0,0,srean,,,"I don't think it is really possible to keep a question bank secret. Some students tend to follow up with those who had taken the course last time, at least in my university. So if the question bank is <i>voluminous</i> <i>enough</i>, why not just make it open ?<p>Whats the worst that can happen, people might go through it and learn all the solutions. Well, let them, that's the purpose of the course anyways. But the question bank cant so small that it does not explore the full diversity of problems. And no one is claiming that all questions will be from the question-bank, throw in a few off question-bank odd-balls each year.<p>But how could they analyze the submissions to figure out (even approximately) who cheated who did not ? Apart from trawling their email and phone calls and wire taps that is....:-) I suspect part of the ""forensics"" was a bluff.<p>I can only guess that there are a few problems in the set that historically have a low probability of being solved correctly. So whoever solved those can be marked suspicious.
But a test will have only a few of those.<p>But it sure sucks to be in a course where the instructor is unaware of the problem that QB is available and you are unwilling to look up the QB. Particularly where the QB was particularly designed for the top percentile.",1290336666

1926849,comment,1925884,1926057,0,0,willyt,,,"A council house in the UK is a dwelling that is provided by the local municipal authority. Rents are about 1/2 to 1/3 of the lowest market rent. They are generally set by the local council. In addition to this you can receive housing benefit to pay most of this if you are out of work, the rules for this are quite complicated.<p>The concept dates back to postwar reconstruction in the 1950s when they were originally built at a large scale to replace bomb damaged and run down private 'slum' housing. I think I remember a lecturer saying that in the 1970's as much as 60% of the British population lived in council houses. In the 1980's Margaret Thatcher introduced 'right to buy' legislation which forced local councils to offer tenants the opportunity to buy their council house for well below the market value. This lead to a large decline in the number of people living in council houses. I think the proportion is more like 20% of the UK population now.<p>There has been a big cultural shift in Britain in the last 30 years; living in a council house was considered 'normal' but is now stigmatised. The quality of the accommodation can vary widely.<p><a href=""http://bit.ly/c3JuFb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/c3JuFb</a>
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/londonsocialhousing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/groups/londonsocialhousing/</a><p>Council houses are not always in housing estates ('projects' in US) they can be normal houses intermingled with private housing that just happen to be owned by the council and rented out to council tenants. However this is rare now because of the 'right to buy'<p>There is a shortage of council housing, if you want to get one you have to be assessed as being in need of one and you go on a waiting list. Your position on the waiting list is based on points. The points are allocated based on criteria like: how long you've been waiting; how many kids you have; if you are being threatened; if you have disabilities etc.<p>By the way, I'm not totally sure about the percentage figures, they are based on a memory from a lecture about 10 years ago. I'll try and find some references to back them up.",1290336010

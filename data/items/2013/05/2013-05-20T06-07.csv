5736281,comment,5733935,5735615,1,0,AlisdairO,,,"I think my own answer would be that a database system is very often the right solution if you know what you're doing with them.  In this situation, diagnosing performance problems is quite easy (thanks to diagnostics), concurrency is certainly easier, and scaling can be easier too - because problems like concurrent file access for writing are hard in a flat-file situation and easy on the database, and that's exactly the kind of problem you often run into when you scale.<p>Unfortunately, when you don't know what you're doing with them, they're basically a black box where magic happens, and you don't know how to fix any problems that occur.  The thing is, that applies to many things.  When you don't know what you're doing with concurrent file access, you'll run into even bigger problems than you will on an RDBMS - just last week I was in fact rewriting an otherwise-competent colleague's code, because concurrent read/write to files caused massive unrecoverable corruption issues.<p>I don't think your wordpress comparison is apples to apples - wordpress is known to be dog-slow, and if you tried similar access patterns over file systems it would be at least as bad.  There's little incentive for them to fix it, though, because wordpress sites are read-mostly, and all you have to do to fix all your problems is stick one of the wordpress caches in front of it.  Frankly it boggles my mind that they don't ship with a cache on by default.<p>There's absolutely a place for no-db - if your content is static or write-once, doesn't need indexing over, and you can guarantee that those requirements won't change. In this case, there's no need at all to use a db, and it will simplify your life not to.  I'm writing such a site as we speak, in fact!  If you have dynamic content, well, I'd use a DBMS personally.<p>tl;dr: understanding how to use RDBMSs will make the average software engineer's life much easier.<p>edit: Just a note on SQLite specifically: SQLite can be slow compared to the common file system trick of write new temporary file -> rename, because the file system trick (on ext3 at least) doesn't require an fsync.  It does mean that the change is not guaranteed durable, but often for browser data that's OK!  An equivalent in database-land would be not writing every single transaction to the transaction log when it commits.  That means that on a crash you lose everything that hasn't hit the disk yet, but you maintain consistency.  Pre 3.7 SQLite this wasn't supported because SQLite didn't use write-ahead logging, which meant you had to fsync to maintain consistency.  I believe in WAL mode this behaviour is easily available now though!",1369032846

As the PBS NewsHour story about the causes and effects of China's meat consumption habits shows, Western habits are having a significant influence in the diets of the younger generation in developing countries. The effects of large-scale pollution of water resources is horrific, and competition for water resources is, after oil, the next source of conflict in the world.  So yes, it will affect everyone.<p>> Everyone knows this. That doesn't mean most First World people need supplements, because they don't.<p>Sure, First World people don't need supplements, if they have a varied diet.  In North America, that's a big if.  There are cultural impediments to that varied diet, even for those with the means to afford it.  But for many lower-income families, and especially those living in low-income neighborhoods, they experience the ""food desert"" problem.  And they lack the same access to quality foods as more affluent people.  That is a systemic issue related to how society (via government) deals with the problem.  And the economics of the prices of foods is, in some part, related to the energy requirements which is related to the 90% energy loss up each level of the food chain.  There is an environmental impact there.<p>btw: I just threw in the names of Bittman and Pollan as representatives of the ideas of plant-based and natural diets.  It's not like they invented the ideas; they're just the most recognizable cheerleaders for them at the moment.",1369030276
5736168,comment,5735731,5736081,1,0,yareally,,,"AOSP S4 would be what I would get (and will get depending on if the modem chipsets support cdma/lte). After dealing with prior OEM devices and the ugly hacks I had to do to root them and compile the source (as well as laggy updates), I don't think I could ever deal with one again (though my experience was based on Android <= 2.3). Devices you can unlock the bootloader to and access the /data partition where the apps lie makes doing things like working with sqlite super easy when you can just mount the Android device via sshfs and go right to the app directory you're working on to change the sqlite db without reinstalling the app. Not a thing most are aware of, but it makes life so much easier that way for development.<p>If you are looking into development at all, Scala works well on Android if you prefer something other than Java. I only moved to using it the last couple of weeks (used C#/Mono and Java previously), but it's better than I thought it would be. I got it working without any external building or extra plugins in intellij idea as well (setup guide I put on github earlier today <a href=""https://github.com/yareally/android-scala-intellij-no-sbt-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yareally/android-scala-intellij-no-sbt-pl...</a>).<p>I'm stuck on Verizon for now and torn between keeping unlimited data and getting a newer device I won't hate.

Now find a cell tower in that distance with fiber and available mounting space. I suppose that isn't a big problem in a more densely populated area like southern California, but still more challenging than parking a 11Ghz dish on a rooftop somewhere within 14 mile or so.<p>From what I've heard most carrier interest in high frequency bands is for links going a few city blocks to connect micropops back to a area hub site.

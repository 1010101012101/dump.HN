Donald Knuth uses a fictional assembly language in his Art of Computer Programming because he believes that any abstraction provides a place for bad analysis to hide under the covers. For instance, in your example, you use an addition operator whose implementation is undefined. It might be implemented as a string of increments and run in linear time. It might use a scheme of bit shifts and run in some logarithmic time. It might be implemented to run as a look-up table in constant time. The point is that you don't know what the processor's actually going to do, and this is what Knuth was getting at.<p>However, in nearly every analysis I've done, mathematical operations are assumed to run in constant time because it can cloud the overall picture of an algorithm's complexity with an implementation detail.

Bluntly, as illustrated by the book of this thread, the K-12 system is rarely able to teach anything worthwhile much beyond just the basic 3Rs.<p>This conclusion is not new:  Once I looked at AP calculus.  Don't.  The people who wrote the AP calculus materials don't understand calculus.  Instead, for calculus, just get a good college text and dig in.  I learned from Johnson and Kiokemeister, taught from Protter and Morrey, and have seen several other good college calculus texts, e.g., from Thomas.  When I was studying and, later, teaching calculus in college, there was no shortage of good texts.  Just why K-12 has so much trouble getting good calculus texts is strange and tragic.<p>Once I looked at some materials on optimization, i.e., linear programming, developed by the K-12 system in North Carolina.  Don't.  Those materials fill several much needed gaps on the library shelves and would be illuminating if ignited.  The authors didn't understand linear programming.<p>The site<p><a href=""http://boston.conman.org/2004/01/21.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boston.conman.org/2004/01/21.1</a><p>has some excellent quotes from Feynman looking at K-12 texts.  Feynman was correct, and apparently the situation has not changed.<p>My qualifications:  I hold a Ph.D. from one of the world's best research universities; there I did research on optimization and also on stochastic optimal control.  For calculus, I've done well studying it, advanced calculus, and well beyond, taught calculus in college, applied calculus in business and to problems of US national security, and published peer-reviewed original research using calculus.  For optimization, I've studied it at advanced levels, applied it in both in business to problems of US national security, taught it in college and graduate school, and published peer-reviewed original research in it.  My startup has some original, crucial, core, powerful, valuable 'secret sauce' that is based on some advanced topics in applied math including 'analysis' (way past calculus), probability, and statistics.",1320675279

In fact when the LEDs power up they are waiting for the first packet to arrive and they will use the address in that packet to set the address for that LED.  Until an LED has received its first packet it will not forward packets on.<p>So that allows you to program the LEDs with arbitrary addresses.  I make use of this to program addresses that are easy to encode for the 7x7 display (each address is six bits so I use 3 bits for X and 3 bits for Y).

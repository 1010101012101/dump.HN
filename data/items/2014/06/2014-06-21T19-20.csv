Aaronson may be joking when he says he&#x27;s &quot;solv[ed] a 2400-year-old open problem in philosophy,&quot; but in case he&#x27;s not, this doesn&#x27;t come anywhere close to solving ethics. Philosophically speaking, it&#x27;s still necessary to show why his definition of &quot;moral&quot; holds up.

7925889,comment,7922745,7922745,1,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Makes a hell of a lot more sense than rebasing 70-odd separate patches for your internal use! Making LibReSSL-portable is a good goal, and this work can be used to improve both (and OpenSSL, too - some of this found its way into the OpenSSL 1.2 branch).<p>I think the &quot;safe&quot; (EC)DSA nonce implementation is interesting but could use some review, and I&#x27;ve communicated that to the author: it&#x27;s not as good as the proposal in RFC6979[1] (which uses HMAC_DRBG - which is good - to generate a truly deterministic DSA nonce, with test vectors and everything!). In particular, BN_generate_dsa_nonce from these patches uses modular reduction down into the prime order, which has a small bias towards 0 of course. The NIST prime orders aren&#x27;t as close to powers of two as you might like to get away with that, and if I&#x27;m being honest, I&#x27;m not sure you can get away with <i>anything</i> with (EC)DSA - it is extraordinarily fragile in a way I think was always deliberate. The practical impact is probably limited, but I really don&#x27;t want to take any chances there. (Ideally I&#x27;d want Ed25519, or something very like it - there really ought to be some more discussion on CFRG about that - although it&#x27;s going to be quite some time before anyone can roll it out in certificates widely.)<p>Right now, it&#x27;s still lipstick on a pig. OpenSSL is hairy as fuck. Long-term, I think the LibReSSL cleanup-via-demolition approach and then carefully rebuilding what&#x27;s left over is what&#x27;s needed. But I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to run LibReSSL in the middle of such fundamental reworking - and in the meantime, some of these patches look quite familiar to me. :)\n___\n1. <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979</a> - Deterministic Usage of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)",1403379965
7925888,comment,7925671,7925831,14,0,byuu,,,"It was a mostly manual process. I was trying to understand why four rules (one for each output pixel) were needed inside every case statement. So I wrote a parser for the original source file that turned each output pixel rule into an integer representing what the code for it was actually doing.<p>From here I noticed the strong symmetry when you rotated the pixels. Which of course makes perfect sense, I was just able to confirm it here.<p>So I tried to reproduce the same tables using a LUT and rotate table, and matched all but two instances. This seemed really weird to me, since I figured this would have to be generated unrolled code, right? So I asked Maxim about it, and he said that they were probably mistakes. I was pretty shocked myself that he did this by hand.<p>I did a few blind comparison photos on my board to see if anyone could tell the difference (in practice it amounted to one or two pixel differences in each 256x224 upscaled image), and everyone actually favored mine, so I just went ahead and ignored those two differences.<p>I&#x27;m curious if the blog author noticed the same thing, or if he noticed the rotation quicker and only built his tables off of the top-left output rules.<p>Ultimately it looks like the blog author found a better route to reducing the comparison rules than I did. But I still don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve 100% cracked how and why the original author chose the rules he did. And since it sounds like it was done almost by sight, we probably never will.<p>Still, I&#x27;d really like to see if someone could find a way to generate the comparison rules mathematically. It&#x27;s very likely that if we had some sort of scientific basis for when and why to blend each case, we could improve the visual appearance beyond that of the original algorithm. Obviously perfection doesn&#x27;t exist. I&#x27;d expect the end result to be a function that takes tuning variables, and different input images would look better with different tuning values. But even for the default case, I bet we could do better.",1403379935

7925879,comment,7917976,7919645,1,0,kelnos,,,"Oh, I absolutely agree with that.  Re-reading my posts, I realize I wasn&#x27;t clear: I definitely don&#x27;t think much of this is valid or useful when talking about a company that&#x27;s grown beyond 75 or so.  The SV notion of company culture absolutely does not scale.<p>But when you&#x27;re 5 people, or, I&#x27;d even argue, 15, 30, or 50, working your asses off to get your first product to market, &quot;getting along&quot; in all those ways can be extremely important.<p>Ironically, the only company where I&#x27;ve worked where there were somewhat-forced social activities was a large (>300 people) one, with the &quot;HR bullshit&quot; team-building exercises and the like.  The small companies I&#x27;ve worked at certainly have had company-organized activities, but they always felt (to me, at least) much more informal and optional.  My main examples are a company I joined at ~12 people, and left around 100, and another company where I joined around 60, and is now probably pushing 300.<p>My current job is interesting because I was there when we had the company-organized stuff that most people wanted to participate in (while those who didn&#x27;t were free to abstain, and there wasn&#x27;t pressure to conform).  Now we&#x27;re getting large enough to either not have those things anymore, or have things that try to appeal to everyone, which ends up feeling more forced sometimes.  On the plus side, we&#x27;re still doing one-off informal things all the time that are generally employee-driven (rather than &quot;official&quot;), and the different activities attract different sub-groups within the company who are interested in those things.<p><i>It&#x27;s sad that more founders don&#x27;t understand the concept of corporate values. Instead of trying to hire folks who look the same and want essentially the same experience from their job, it is possible to build a strong, diverse organizations united by shared values.</i><p>I don&#x27;t necessarily see that as good or bad.  A strong, diverse organization isn&#x27;t going to be the same (socially) as a more homogeneous org.  I&#x27;m not going to draw a value judgment about either of those, because I think they&#x27;re both valid choices that each company should be permitted to make for themselves (assuming they aren&#x27;t actively discriminating against protected classes).  It&#x27;s certainly a choice that affects the company&#x27;s trajectory and probably likelihood of success, but, again, I think that&#x27;s a choice.  Maybe the diverse org will net you a $1bn exit, and the &quot;socially-integrated&quot; choice gets you a $250mn exit, or even no exit at all.  IMO it&#x27;s about the journey and whether you felt it was a worthwhile experience.",1403379765

A portion of such people might qualify just fine for disability (SSDI, SSI), but many long-term unemployed do not. To qualify a person can&#x27;t just prove they haven&#x27;t been able to find any available jobs they&#x27;re capable of doing, but prove that there isn&#x27;t any possible job at all they could do, regardless of openings or likelihood of being hired.<p>There is disability fraud that goes on (cases that don&#x27;t meet the legal definition, but are misrepresented and approved), especially for areas with very high unemployment, but this is illegal and not supposed to happen, and efforts are constantly underway to crack down, often to the detriment of many unequivocally legitimate (by legal definition) disability recipients.<p>- For food assistance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), provides usually $100-$300 per person in monthly supplemental assistance for purchasing groceries. But for those people without additional income to put towards food, it is often not enough and seeking out additional non-governmental help is necessary to not go hungry. In many states long-term unemployed people, regardless of need, do not even qualify (assistance is time-limited).<p>- Except in the case of low-income parents, cash assistance is very rare or nonexistent most places in the US.<p>- Health care - the Affordable Care Act (ACA) improved the situation for a large portion of uninsured Americans, mostly by providing variable subsidies for a wide range of incomes, and disallowing insurance companies from denying or cancelling coverage for medical reasons.<p>Even now though, in some states many low income-people still cannot obtain insurance; some State governments (like Texas, Florida and others) chose not to expand their Medicaid programs to cover all adults below the poverty level, as was expected. In those states non-disabled adults below the poverty level do not qualify for Medicaid, or even for the same subsidies provided to those in higher income brackets.<p>-----<p>A basic income would ease a lot of pains for low-income individuals who do not qualify for current aid programs, or qualify but do not receive benefits for various other reasons: like not knowing it&#x27;s available, daunting paperwork and proof of identity/need requirements, stigma, etc. The bureaucratic overhead of processing applications and managing current cases for a range of programs would be greatly reduced too.",1403379285

Also, whether it&#x27;s as part of a team or completely autonomous.<p>* Include links, to a company website if you are one, or to your own website / twitter / github / etc if you have them.<p>* Post hourly jobs only. Fixed price jobs may be appropriate sometimes, but only if they&#x27;re fully specced out to avoid scope creep.<p>* oDesk allows you to specify the experience level you want (Entry Level - $, Intermediate - $$, Expert - $$$), treat this more as how much you&#x27;re willing to pay rather than the real experience level. Ideally, they should correlate, but they often don&#x27;t.<p>Tagging the ad with the tech is important, I have a filtered view on the job feed to remove all that isn&#x27;t relevant to me.

If your ad is tagged and it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m interested in then I&#x27;ll see it.<p>Next, filtering out the less good / less interested freelancers by making the job application process a little more difficult. Many freelancers spam out applications without even reading the ad contents, you want to exclude them.<p>* I&#x27;ve seen some ads that ask freelancers to include a certain word in their application so the client can filter based on that.<p>* Even better (IMO), and the best way to find good hires, is to include a couple of your own questions in the application. oDesk allows you to set these in addition or instead of the standard cover letter approach. It will filter out a lot of freelancers that are solely spamming out applications and don&#x27;t have time for anything that doesn&#x27;t fit the standard template.

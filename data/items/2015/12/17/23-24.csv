You recognize simple and vague approximate models first then bias your search towards the more complex rules that are under you best top level approximations in the hierarchy.<p>It&#x27;s like a probabilistic binary search in the model taxonomy.<p>One thing that makes me hopeful that the learning process is possible is that the non-terminal grammar rules are generic and can always become anything. You don&#x27;t tend to get stuck in local maxima even if you only search a small part of the program space when any node can always be swapped for a node of any another category.<p>My problem right now is that my MCMH doesn&#x27;t mix well. Even though I tried to shorten the jumps between models of different complexity for a particular thing, once the vague model traces are well fitted to the training examples, there is too deep a score chasm to jump to the next level of complexity.<p>My simulations seem to get stuck in simpler modelisations of things. I want simpler models to recursively open the door to learning and recognizing slightly more complex models just under them in the hierarchy but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening. The hierarchy is not really even forming properly.<p>I might be missing something stupid. I don&#x27;t consider myself an expert in these things. I just dabble for fun. It&#x27;s one of the reason I&#x27;m discussing it here.

Our brains &quot;bite the Bayesian bullet&quot; a bit too hard, <i>accepting</i> noisy data as-is and just making whatever inferences are feasible, rather than computing how to obtain clearer, less-noisy data (which is why we developed science as a form of domain knowledge rather than as an intuitive algorithm).",1450396503

10755614,comment,10754487,10754487,0,0,tunesmith,,,"I have one basic question on friendly AI - suppose we work and work and eventually figure out how to code in a friendly value system in a foolproof way, given any definition of &quot;friendly&quot;. Great. But given that ability, how do you even define what &quot;friendly&quot; or &quot;good&quot; is?<p>As a layman, I so far can only see it in terms of basic philosophy and normative ethics. By definition, a friendly AI is one that doesn&#x27;t merely deal with facts, but also with &quot;should&quot; statements.<p>Hume&#x27;s Guillotine says you can&#x27;t derive an ought statement from is statements alone. Some folks like Sam Harris disagree but they&#x27;re really just making strenuous arguments that certain moral axioms should be universally accepted.<p>Münchhausen Trilemma says that when asking why, in this case why something should or should not be done, you&#x27;ve only got three choices - keep asking why forever, resort to circular reasoning, or eventually rely on axioms. In this case, moral axioms or value statements.<p>So it seems like any friendly AI is going to have to rely on moral axioms in some sense. But how do you even define what they are? Normative ethics is generally seen to have three branches. For consequentialism (like utilitarianism) you make your decision based on its probable outcome, using some utility function. For deontology, you rely on hardcoded rules. For value ethics, you make decisions based off of whether they align with your own self-perception of being a good person.<p>But all three have flaws - in consequentialism, it&#x27;s like putting on blinders to other system effects, and the proposed actions are often deeply unsettling (like pushing a guy off a bridge to block a trolley from killing three others). In deontology and value ethics, actions and the principles they are derived from can be deeply at odds - whether it&#x27;s hypocrisy in deontology or &quot;road to hell being paved by good intentions&quot; in value ethics. In general, deeply counterintuitive effects can be derived from simple principles, as anyone familiar with systems dynamics knows.<p>But even beyond that, even if we had a reasonable, consistent AI controlled by solid values, and even if the people judging the AI could <i>accept</i> the conclusions/actions that the AIs derive from those values, how would we ever get consensus on what those values should be? For instance, even in our community there&#x27;s a fair amount of disagreement among these basic root-level utility functions:<p>- Maximize current life (people alive today), like Bill Gates believes.\n - Maximize future life (survival of species)\n - Maximize health of planet<p>etc, etc - those utility functions lead to different &quot;should&quot; conclusions, often in surprising ways.",1450396408

A &quot;live coding&quot; exercise after (in their words) two excellent phone screens.\nThe test was to implement a class which would be run through a bunch of unit tests. Simple right? It turned out to be a disaster.<p>First was the choice of language. They offered to take it in JS, Ruby, Python, or Java. I&#x27;m a .NET developer whose competent with JS, but I really could be better at it. I asked to take it in C# but they refused and said it&#x27;s not about specific language knowledge. So I did in in JS. I turned out to be almost completely about JS specifics and quirks. Because I&#x27;ve been learning JS recently, I&#x27;ve had the fortune of having to avoid the bad parts. When asked to recite them I struggled. This part is obviously my fault but if I had been allowed to perform in C#, I would have done a hell of a lot better.<p>Second was the environment. I have very limited exposure to programming on a Macbook and I spent the first few minutes struggling to translate all of my shortcuts. During a timed test it was pretty disheartening to not be able to type as fast as I could. I haven&#x27;t used Sublime before but the default theme was near unreadable and I was allowed to switch it after a few minutes. The third was the test framework. I really wasn&#x27;t familiar with how Jasmine worked in the browser, and it showed. Again, my fault. But taking 5 minutes to familiarize me with their setup would have made things go much, much better for me.<p>Before I get jumped on for blaming them for my poor performance, this was for a test automation role. I explicitly said that my JS/Jasmine/etc. skills were not that great and they still brought me on site.<p>Honestly, I would have preferred the whiteboard. Each test took up nearly the entire period, leaving very short time for talks about what I really care about - culture. I have a Github with a bunch of good projects. I&#x27;ve been employed as a developer for a while now. I can obviously program well. Drop the bullshit and lets talk.",1450395880

Privilege escalation can be hard to catch, and can be a separate bug in and of itself, even if it requires a separate exploit to get the initial privileges.<p>The published policy didn&#x27;t say anything about not doing what he did. I&#x27;m not going to argue that what he did should or shouldn&#x27;t be ok, but FB has no control over what other people do. Yeah, maybe it&#x27;d be better if people asked for clarification first instead of asking forgiveness, but there&#x27;s no way to force them to do that. FB does have control over what their policy says and allows/disallows. If you don&#x27;t want people to exfiltrate any data and look at it on a local machine instead of just keeping a session on the exploited machine, then put that in the policy. If you don&#x27;t want people poking around for other exploits after gaining access, then spell that out in the policy.<p>The point of the policy isn&#x27;t to stop everyone. Sure it will stop some/most people, but some people don&#x27;t listen. The point is that when it happens again you can point to the clear policy and say &quot;you&#x27;re an asshole, we&#x27;re not paying you because you violated our explicit policy, and we are reviewing what you did with our lawyers to see if we should notify law enforcement&quot;.<p>Yes, doing this fix/policy update now doesn&#x27;t fix this situation, but it prevents anyone else from doing something similar and claiming ignorance of this situation and FB&#x27;s position.",1450395508

10755462,comment,10752570,10754471,0,0,iheartmemcache,,,"I&#x27;ve done it one of two ways - via VBA and via VSTO Add-ins. My VBA version has been carefully crafted to emulate a pseudo-ORM based off INFORMATION_SCHEMA and all, making it pretty portable. It works fairly well because what usually ends up happening is say Partner Foo will have his read-write to his schema and it will all be segmented up via catalog views and other rules. There are the standard concurrency issues (you have to discuss with your client whether you want him to take a mutex on the result set, or potentially allow stale data) so it&#x27;s fairly naive in that regard. The upside of it it&#x27;s all self-contained (i.e., not a pile) and portable because you effectively get &quot;reflection&quot; with any sufficiently decent RDBMS impl. Maybe 10-15% of that VBA has to be tweaked based on their business requirements (defining behavior like if pri_row gets deleted in table foo by user bar, do you offer a prompt to cascade delete[1]?)<p>In some situations [such as a cascade delete], the business requirements need the Stakeholder or PM or TL or whomever to authorize certain events due to internal corporate governance policies. At that point, the VSTO add-in route is taken because usually there has to be integration with other governance/workflow software (one of the subsidiaries for Blue Cross/Blue Shield I worked with was notoriously bad re: pushing the buck and over-complicating workflows). Anyways, the MSVS sln I use with that is pretty much the opposite of a VBA pile.<p>[1] There&#x27;s almost never any destructive DELETE&#x27;s taken, rather a boolean active flag is toggled, and a new row is inserted with a more recent timestamp so you can &#x27;...order by timestamp desc limit 1&#x27;. That way if auditors come in, not only do they have the full audit log but we can reconstruct state at any given time.<p>Either way, a naive VBA implementation that doesn&#x27;t appeal to system tables for all the schema info can easily be written (in a maintainable fashion, as maintainable as VBA goes at least) in under a week.",1450394878

Maybe there&#x27;s nothing beyond our level of understanding, just a more accelerated and accurate version of it. An AI will think on the same level as us, just faster. In that case, in that hypothetical, an AI 100x faster than a person is not much better than 100 people.

10755411,comment,10750518,10750518,0,0,zeveb,,,"People say this. Steve Yegge wrote a whole blog entry about it in 2009[1]. It&#x27;s supposed to be so difficult to legalise something, but really it&#x27;s not legalising it which is difficult but half-legalising it which is. Let&#x27;s take Steve&#x27;s blog questions:<p>> Is it legal to drink alcohol in a TV commercial? No? OK, what about marijuana, then? Can you smoke it in a commercial? Can you SHOW it? Can you talk about it? Can you show marijuana smoke at a party, without anyone actually being seen smoking it? Can you recommend its use to children under the age of 9? What exactly are the laws going to be around advertising and marijuana?<p>None. Why should there be? Done.<p>> Do we let everyone out of prison who was incarcerated for possession and/or sale of marijuana? If not, then what do we tell them when they start rioting? If so, what do we do with them? Do we subsidize halfway houses? Do we give them their pot back? How much pot, exactly, do they need to have possessed in order to effect their judicial reversal and subsequent amnesty? A bud? An ounce? A cargo ship full?<p>Release them. They broke the (unjust) law as it then stood, so they don&#x27;t get reparations. Done.<p>> Is it legal to sell, or just possess? If the latter, then how do we integrate the illegality of selling it into the advertising campaigns that tell us it&#x27;s legal to own it?<p>Of course it&#x27;s legal to sell. What business of the State is it if one citizen wishes to sell something to another citizen? Done.<p>> If it&#x27;s legal to sell it, WHO can sell it? Who can they sell it to? Where can they sell it? Where can they purchase it? Are we simply going to relax all the border laws, all the policies, all the local, state and federal laws and statutes that govern how we prioritize policing it? All at once? Is there a grandfather clause? On what _exact_ date, GMT, does it become legal, and what happens to pending litigation at that time?<p>Anyone can sell it, starting at midnight. All charges for selling it are dismissed at the same time (c.f. re. prisoners, supra). Done.<p>> Are we going to license it? Like state alcohol liquor licenses, of which there are a fixed number? What department does the licensing? How do you regulate it? Who inspects the premises looking for license violations, and how often? What, exactly, are they looking for?<p>Why license the sale of something? If someone wants to sell something, and someone wants to buy it, why interfere? If someone says he is selling marijuana, and is actually selling oregano, that sounds like fraud to me: there are civil and criminal courts which can then be involved. Done.<p>> Is it OK to smoke marijuana at home? At work? In a restaurant? In a designated Pot Bar? On the street? Can you pull out a seventeen-foot-long water bong and take a big hit in the middle of a shopping mall, and ask everyone near you to take a hit with you, since it&#x27;s totally awesome skunkweed that you, like, can&#x27;t get in the local vending machine? If it&#x27;s not OK, then why not?<p>What business of the State is it if you wish to permit smoking in your home or business, or on your property? On public property, why would not the laws against assaulting people in general not apply? Done.<p>> Can you drive when you&#x27;re stoned? What&#x27;s the legal blood-THC level? Is it state-regulated or federal-regulated? For that matter, what is the jurisdiction for ALL marijuana-related laws? Can states override federal rulings? Provinces? Counties? Cities? Homeowners associations?<p>This is the only even slightly bothersome part. Fortunately, we have a system for determining whether someone is guilty of driving intoxicated: it&#x27;s called a jury trial. Done.<p>> What exactly is the Coast Guard supposed to do now? Can illegal drug smugglers just land and start selling on the docks? Are consumers supposed to buy their marijuana on the street? What happens to the existing supply-chain operations? How are they taxed? Who oversees it?<p>The DEA and friends can get honest jobs. Why would marijuana be taxed any differently from anything else? Done.<p>> Can you smoke marijuana on airplanes? Can airplanes offer it to their customers in-flight? Is it regulated in-flight more like tobacco (don&#x27;t get the smoke in other peoples&#x27; faces) or alcohol (imbibe as you will, as long as you don&#x27;t &quot;appear intoxicated&quot;?) What about marijuana brownies? Are you allowed to eat it in areas where you&#x27;re not allowed to smoke it?<p>If a private business wishes to permit its customers to consume something on its premises, why does the State have to get involved? Done.<p>> Can an airplane captain smoke pot? A ship captain? A train conductor? The driver of a car? An attendee at a Broadway musical? A politician in a legislative session? What is the comprehensive list of occupations, positions and scenarios in which smoking pot is legal? What about eating pot? What about holding it? What about holding a pot plant? What about the seeds?<p>This is just the intoxication question again, and again there is already a system in place. Done.<p>> Speaking of the seeds, are there different laws governing distribution, sale and possession of seeds vs. plants vs. buds vs. joints? If so, why? If not, why not?<p>Why should there be? Get out of the petty-tyranny business and get on with life. Done.<p>> What laws govern the transportation of marijuana in any form into or out of countries where it is still illegal? What policies are states able to enact? Is it OK under any circumstances for a person to go to jail over the possession or use of marijuana? If so, what are those circumstances?<p>What business of a State are another State&#x27;s laws? Why should marijuana be any different from any other intoxicating substance at all? Done.<p>> Are there any laws governing the use of marijuana by atheletes? U.S. military personnel? Government employees? Government contractors? U.S. ambassadors, in title or in spirit? What are our extradition laws? What do we do about citizens who are subject to the death penalty in countries like Singapore for the possession of sufficient quantities of what we now consider to be legal substances?<p>Why would the State care about what athletes or other citizens do? Why wouldn&#x27;t rules already in place, which boil down to &#x27;don&#x27;t make us look bad,&#x27; not apply?<p>As for citizens being held by other countries: imprisonment or execution of a citizen for an act not criminal in his own country may invite invasion. &#x27;Civi Romani sum.&#x27; Done.<p>> What about derivatives? Are the laws the same for hashish? How do we tell the difference? What if someone engineers a super-powerful plant? How do the new laws extend to a potential spectrum of new drugs similar to THC?<p>Why does the State have to grasp for every bit of power? Just let it go! Done.<p>> For driving and operating machinery, do we have legal definitions that are equivalent of blood-alcohol percentage, and if so, what are these definitions? How do we establish them? How do we figure out what is actually dangerous? How do we test for these levels? When they are established, do we we put up signs on all roadways? Do we update the Driver&#x27;s Education materials? How do we communicate this change to the public?<p>This is the <i>same</i> intoxication question, again. For the third time: done.<p>> How does legalization impact our public health education programs? Do they have to immediately retract all campaigning, advertising and distributed literature that mentions marijuana? How does legalization interact with the &quot;Say no to drugs&quot; programs? Do we need extra education to differentiate between a drug that is now legal (but wasn&#x27;t before) and drugs that are still illegal? What&#x27;s our story here? What about other drugs that are even less addictive and/or less intrusive than marijuana?<p>If it&#x27;s harmful, what is the problem in continuing to say it&#x27;s harmful? If it&#x27;s not, why was public health education lying? This is a non-objection. Done.<p>> Monsanto is eventually going to sue the living shit out of someone for using genetically-engineered pot seeds. Can they sue individuals with a single plant in their windowsill? (answer: yes) Will Oprah step in and help that beleaguered individual? (answer: we&#x27;ll see!)<p>Why should it be any different than any other seed. Done.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s hard to retain some control while giving up some control. Why do that? It&#x27;s really not that big a deal, if a State is willing to be an adult and to treat its citizens like adults (and as for children: it&#x27;s their parents&#x27; job to see that they behave according to their parents&#x27; desires, not the State&#x27;s, according to its own). Just let go!<p>[1] <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/04/have-you-ever-legalized-marijuana.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2009/04/have-you-ever-legali...</a>",1450394265

When you have an entity in its native form, it needs to be _encoded_ for the purposes of communication (in a broad sense). The encoded message can then be to be _decoded_ back to the natural form. There is no ambiguity.<p>Really, the reason people get them mixed up in Python is because Python 2 totally stacked it by adding str.encode and unicode.decode.<p>In Python 2, you can _decode_ unicode to unicode – which it does by silently _encoding_ as ascii first. This operation is total madness.<p><pre><code>    >>> u = u&#x27;\xe9&#x27;\n    >>> u.decode(&#x27;utf8&#x27;)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File &quot;<stdin>&quot;, line 1, in <module>\n    UnicodeEncodeError: &#x27;ascii&#x27; codec can&#x27;t encode character u&#x27;\xe9&#x27; in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)\n</code></pre>\nThe error here is in the step where you _encode_ the unicode to acsii, something you didn&#x27;t ask it to do at all.<p>And similarly, you can encode str to str (where str is really bytes in Python 2, another issue that adds to the confusion).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I feel your pain. When I was using Python 2 I also got confused about what form things were in and where I needed to encode / decode.<p>Honestly, once I switched to Python 3, that cognitive overhead just totally vanished. str is the natural form of text, and if I need to store / communicate it I _encode_ it to bytes (utf8, generally). When I&#x27;m loading a stored/transmitted message, I _decode_ it to its natural text form.<p>There are edge cases that make certain situations more complex, but in terms of general usage, I feel Python 3 really got this stuff right.",1450393767

If you broke rule 2, your license goes away and you can&#x27;t have another unless you pay a very expensive deposit and get closely supervised for several years, at your expense.

Hey guys, I have a novel idea: instead of adding a button, just _show_ me that list!<p>And do you know what happens if you press that button? The website scrolls down a ~300 pixels and then you can see the first 1.8 entries of that list!? F*ck this shit! You have ~900 vertical pixels at your disposal and all you manage to do is to show me TWO lousy items?<p>I actually tried to scroll down the list and it took me FORTYFOUR (!) scrolls of my mouse wheel to reach the end of the page. 44 scrolls to see a list of just 40 items?! This is horrible! In what world do you live if you think that this is a good user experience.<p>There is a lot of stuff killing the web right now, but one of the things nobody ever talks about is this horrible &quot;modern&quot; design which is nothing more than a wasteland of white padding, waste of space, way too large fonts and oversized picture banners which take way too much bandwidth too load.<p>In my opinion we should introduce a whitespace-to-content or padding-to-content ratio which punishes bad webdesign.<p>Another offender for this is medium.com. Yes, it has good content, but you have to hunt for it in the wast amount of padding and oversized images.<p>Just go and have a look at the mediums frontpage. What do you see? A few words, two buttons and a large image. In order to see any content you have to scroll down and even then they manage to only show you 2 items at the same time. If you want to see more you have to scroll constantly.<p>/rant",1450393284

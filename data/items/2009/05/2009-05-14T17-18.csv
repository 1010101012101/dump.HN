It's painful to even look at, let alone read.<p><a href=""http://monster.typepad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monster.typepad.com/</a> - better content again, but mostly ultra-short articles.<p>None of those are blogs that anyone sensible would read regularly, because they mostly regurgitate fairly boring or self-serving points without any new, useful ideas, and they're badly designed.<p>By ""doing a blog"" I don't mean doing a blog about you or about your business. I mean doing a blog about the topic that your business is related to, and making a genuine effort to write thoughtful articles that will influence the industry positively and/or be of interest to your target market.<p>I'd like to give our blog (<a href=""http://www.woobius.com/scribbles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.woobius.com/scribbles/</a>) as an example, but it's a little bit shambolic at the moment. Yet even so, the ""thought leadership"" articles we posted there generate some good hits and have generated some very good leads for us. Importantly, they've also massively upped our pagerank (because we run it on the same domain rather than a subdomain), which means, for example, that woobius comes up on the first page of results already for, for example, ""construction collaboration"".<p>So there's multiple benefits to creating a <i>good</i> blog. Of course, creating a good blog is hard, but if you can, imho, it's worth it. Whether you can is a function of whether you have interesting ideas about your industry (you probably do) and whether you have a good writer on your team who can write those in a clear, blog-friendly shape.",1242323338

I can complain about variable naming schemes, I can complain about indentation I don't like. I can complain even if it's actually my preferred indentation, because you won't even know better. I can <i>always</i> complain about architecture because there are always pros and cons, which means I can play up the cons and ignore the pros, along with ignoring the fact that we have to use <i>some</i> architecture and ""perfect"" was never on the table. I can say this other architecture should have been used instead, and get you involved in a battle of pro and con analysis that is a perfectly good engineering discussion but will sound like dissembling on the witness stand. I can complain about the bug fix for an issue that <i>I</i> can't imagine how it comes up, but came up in testing. I can, basically, complain all day long, even if it is literally the best C code ever written.<p>Now, I grant that history suggests I'm unlikely to encounter the best C code ever written in one of these contexts, but my point is that since <i>nothing</i> can survive lawyer scrutiny, lawyer scrutiny is actually information-free.<p>The solution to ""Not having any software standards"" can't be ""Requiring absolute, unattainable perfection"", because the only sane response to <i>that</i> is to stop writing software.<p>The <i>real</i> question is not ""Is this software perfect?"", but ""Did it function correctly?"" And I'd be a lot more comfortable if somebody took the source code and the hardware and actually showed a case where it is wrong by physically producing that case, and not just theorizing about how the software might go wrong.<p>All that said, for all I know this thing's a pile of crap. Certainly if I had to lay money, that's the way I'd bet. My point is more that this writeup doesn't meet my standard for determining that it's a pile of crap, and as much fun as it may be to pile on law enforcement, if the price is letting the ""lawyerly-perfection"" standard pass without comment, that price is not worth paying!",1242322845

While it is true that Microsoft used its operating system to help push its browser, it is also true that they just wouldn't have gotten away with this if their browser wasn't great. (Case in point: even though Windows out of the box can play MP3 files, everyone I know uses WinAmp, not the Windows Media Player, to listen to them.

609189,comment,608675,609167,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"<i>And the bit about turning off the illegal opcode interrupt</i><p>I agree with your other analysis, but I have to disagree here. One of the basic tenets of embedded systems design is that ALL interrupts should be handled, even if the handler is just to say ""Hey I processed an interrupt that should never fire.""<p>Given that a system in the wild can be subjected to conditions never encountered in an office or a lab (e.g., a police radio transmitting 2 inches away while this thing is measuring someone's Blood Alcohol Content) you simply can't predict how the processor will behave. That's why you make sure that things like the Watchdog and Illegal Instruction interrupts and resets are properly handled.<p>That this device took these shortcuts would immediately cause me to suspect the rest of the design. If I were the auditor (I would <i>love</i> to get into this kind of work, BTW), I'd start digging deeper right away.",1242321833

Readings are Not Averaged Correctly: When the software takes a series of readings, it first averages the first two readings. Then, it averages the third reading with the average just computed. Then the fourth reading is averaged with the new average, and so on. There is no comment or note detailing a reason for this calculation, which would cause the first reading to have more weight than successive readings.</i><p>The code is computing an exponentially weighted mean. Read that last sentence of the quote again, the analysis has it backwards. The <i>last</i> sample carries more weight, not the first.<p>Now, type ""uptime"" at your unix prompt. Those last three values are computed the same way and have been for decades. (There are three different weighting factors used in them instead of the 1:1 implied in the text here.)<p>The exponentially weighted mean is useful when you care more about the most recent values and when processor resources are highly constrained. It may be what was intended, or maybe not. Generally you would use a weighting factor to make the earlier factors not fade into oblivion as fast as these do, but I'm not going to take the word of someone who can't correctly describe the algorithm in his report.<p>And the bit about turning off the illegal opcode interrupt... the premise is that some sort of failure would alter the program memory in such a way that one of the opcodes became illegal, yet the program would continue to function but produce erroneous results. I'd have to say the probability of this is vanishingly small, in fact, given valid opcode density for microprocessors, much smaller than an instruction being mutated to a legal opcode that somehow allowed the program to still run but produce erroneous results.<p>I guess I should complete with my doubts about 3.  Just because the A/D reads 12 bits doesn't mean you have 12 bits of data. If the 8 low bits are noise there is no information loss in dividing by 256. You have to understand the machine to know if this is a problem.",1242321223

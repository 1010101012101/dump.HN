I too have been in that unfortunate and TERRIBLE cold cell once in my life and know what it feels like to have your freedom stripped from you (and mine ended up costing 10k+ in the end).<p>No one will ever know why Aaron killed himself fully, and that is unfortunate. Most of us only learned of him fully through his suicide. When I watch youtube videos of the guy, he seems so damn intelligent, eloquent, literate... It's hard to imagine that he wasn't smart enough or brave enough to truly ask the community for help.<p>That all said, one of the main things I've learned through my own past escapades and more so through tragic news like this, is that the justice system is inherently fucked up. It is designed to destroy the plaintiff. I have lived through this and it was the most miserable experience of my life (thanks ex gf I used to love for 5 years). Once you are in the 'system', or they are after you, if they have a reason (in their own mind), you are fucked.<p>Unless you are a multi-millionaire who can afford to pay your way out, and even still, you're most likely getting fucked from one direction or the other.<p>I think that is what this entire thing boils down to. Overreach of the Federal Government. Punishment does not fit the alleged and unconvicted crime.<p>Aaron might have had depression issues (a whole different beast in itself), but from all the empirical evidence available to the public, it seems like he was truly pushed into a corner and a high risk for suicide - and unfortunately he fulfilled that presumption.<p>I hope we as a society can learn from this.",1358420330

The talk is that the plea would have been 6 months and that at trial they would have asked for 6 years.  12:1 ratio and they can truthfully say that they weren't asking for the maximum.  They can't truthfully say that they wouldn't seek the ridiculous though.<p>Likewise she focused on the plea bargain offer of side of 6 months but not on the fact that this would have involved admitting guilt to 13 felonies.  For someone with honour who really believed themselves not guilty (at least of serious crime) that could be as much of an issue as 6 months low security detention.  For lawyers it seems to be a game and the sentence and number of convictions is the score; unfortunately the victims of the law take it more seriously.<p>Always look at what isn't said not just what is said.",1358420293

The crime was violating the terms, it isn't relevant where the EOF bit was transmitted. If you made the same files half as big he would have ""stolen"" twice as many files, or twice as big then he would have done half the crime by your logic.<p>He never distributed anything. No clue where you got that from?<p>Additionally ""threatening a business model"" within its self isn't a crime. In fact one might argue that it is a very good thing. Monopolies have often fallen to disruptive technologies, should we go arrest the people behind VoIP because they went after the telecos? Or the inventors of the printing press because they put scribes out of business? Or the inventor of the light-bulb because nobody had to light all of those candles each night?<p>The only ""crime"" here was violating terms. For that they want to hit him with between six months and thirty five years of jail (plus costs, fines, and a criminal record).

The process is optimized for filtering out people. The reason why the job postings and interview questions seem to expect unrealistically high standards has nothing to do with the actual jobs requiring any of those high standards. In reality those jobs tend to be very dull and standard.<p>Tech start-ups and good engineering teams ask a different question: ""What value this talented engineer can provide to our team or product?"" Their job is not to stop people getting hired. Their job is to convert the available Human Resource to economic value as much as they can.<p>As far as I know hiring decisions made only by HR departments don't perform any better than randomly hiring one of those 100 candidates. Actually random is better if you really need the absolute best candidates because HR process has a high risk of filtering them out at the initial stage carried out by a clueless junior HR staff.

And then, they will hopefully turn into constructive, positive-minded members of society.<p>The practice varies with the character of the kid, the ugliness of their crime, etc. I'm not saying this is what Ortiz and co were thinking with Aaron necessarily but I wouldn't be surprised if it was an element. Aaron's behaviour was very removed from the situations I'm talking about, so the participants and response was very different. But he sounds like quite an... intense person, so maybe they decided they needed to put a lot of pressure on him to crush his spirit.<p>Of course, usually the kids don't kill themselves - but then usually it's not the justice department slapping them on the wrist. They should have realised that people like Aaron are very fragile. I won't apologise for that. A more delicate touch was required, because this outcome is just awful and a disaster for all parties. A real shame. But I do want to point out that their actions in frightening him were not necessarily without reason.<p>By the way, I have spent a night in a cold concrete cell sobering up and feeling like the world's biggest idiot. My escapade cost me $2700 and a lot of self-respect, and though it was awful at the time I am thankful and realise I learned my lesson very economically.

He would be equivalent to an anti-prohibition activist that ran a boat to Canada to pick up booze, but only charged for costs of operating the boat and the purchase price of the booze (operating at no profit), and never drank any himself.<p>He would not want to get caught for two reasons: he would not be able to provide the booze to those who need it and it would interfere with his plans to run as an anti-prohibition candidate which he can't with a felony on his record.<p>Utility is discrete rather than linear here: the cost of going ""clean record"" to ""petty felon"" is greater than going from ""petty felon"" to ""petty felon with another conviction"" (non-violent felonies are usually not subject to three-strike laws).<p>So here's what I would find a fit punishment:<p>* Monetary retribution to MIT and investigating agencies (as well as JSTOR if they so choose).

I play a lot sudoku and I will not try your app. All the fancy you added to the sudoku game may be interesting, but the first thing I noticed is that your sudoku game is not ergonomic: on a touch screen, you MUST make the grid as big as possible. Personally, I use a sudoku game where I can put remaining possible digits in cases. If the purpose of your game was to improve my sudoku level, there would me more than 4 levels. I do not know who are your clients. I think that if I had a good free sudoku game (better than the one I am using), I would accept to pay (not too much) to have one more feature: the possibility to play a photographed grid.",1358417327

I am curious though, lets say this issue went to court and the airline was charging the wifi 'thief' with stealing.<p>The case would only pertain to the single flight the thief stole internet access on. And on that particular flight, regardless of whether or not the thief paid or didn't pay he would be reducing the available bandwidth to other customers.  Sure in the long run the airline can play with the pricing of their service to try and limit the number of active users on any given flight, however the price of the service would be locked for any single flight.<p>So doesn't kleiba's analogy of illegal file sharing still stand?",1358417179

Thank you.<p>Recently I started to learn more about ""mentally ill"" people and it have brought me to understanding that what they say is most sane thing I ever heard, they do not hide or pretend or make up story just to go on and work/pay taxes/watch another TV series.<p>They Say directly what world is afraid of, what everyone wants just to hide, put away.

10679472,comment,10674914,10674914,0,0,mathgenius,,,"So much to say about this.<p>I absolutely refused to learn the times-table in school. Even to this day I struggle to add seven and eight. That one seems to confuse me every time. I think the long division algorithm is one of the most difficult things in mathematics, and they teach this to ten year olds! (or they did when i was ten.)<p>So, fast forward many years, and I started doing really well studying advanced mathematics in my undergrad. But somewhere along the line I hit a wall: most math textbooks are written ass-backwards for my brain. I really don&#x27;t get maths by looking at equations. It has taken another 20 some years to move beyond this, and to not be shy about being a disaster when it comes to algebra. Because when it&#x27;s about <i>shape</i> or <i>process</i> that is when I really start to move.<p>My research today is in theoretical quantum physics (finally doing my postgrad.) I&#x27;ve started to see that there are others like me out there: we often sound like nutjobs when talking about maths, because it&#x27;s all a confused mess internally. But somehow from the chaos miracles emerge. This is in contrast to the heavily-linear-thinking types: these people produce sparkling sentences one after another, but often get lost seeing the big picture. The &quot;nutjobs&quot; are a minority, and are so easily criticized. But I sure wish there were more of us doing this hard stuff.<p>One of my favourite math lessons in school occurred when I was about six years old. The teacher had some coloured shapes scattered across the floor, some yellow, some red, some triangles, some discs, etc. She placed a big hoop around all the yellow shapes, and another separate hoop around all the triangles. But there was a problem with this scheme: what to do about the yellow triangles? She let us all stew on this for a few moments, and then the magic happened. If you place one of the hoops overlapping the other, the yellow triangles could inhabit both hoops at the same time.",1449266375

I would say that making work to prevent antisocial behavior is deeply ingrained in civilization itself, and is perhaps at its core; The Prince calls for make-work projects to mandate full employment to keep the peace and it must have been a primary effect, intended or otherwise of pyramid building and other group rituals. The Nietzschean/Emersonian counterdream of everyone retiring to their own homes as gods leaves no peacekeeping force or incentive. The spiderweb on US paper bills symbolizes the intent of economic interdependence as a positive incentive for peace. Without economic interdependence, one could promote peace by propoganda, genetic engineering, medication, and many other ways, but as the population unNEEDed by others increases, I find it hard to see how that population&#x27;s safety could increase indefinitely. The manufacturing of needs, of &quot;increasingly sophisticated consumer tastes&quot; in the Fukuyama-esque formulation, is probably reaching a breaking point (or at least I personally have stopped wanting any new consumer products) but don&#x27;t fail to see the wisdom in an idea just because the devil metaphor can be taken in a manner so literal it offends your sensibilities.",1449266120

The reason for this is that many transactions are not that simple and you end up with a ton of spam on your statements.<p>I will forever be against long settlement times for debit accounts. It reminds me of when I was in college and living paycheck to paycheck. Here in the US many banks have a scheme where they will purposely order your settled transactions from highest to lowest amount in order to charge you more fees should you run out of cash in the account.<p>Say you have $100 available and make 3 purchases in this order: $10, $10, $105. The bank authorizes all three transactions but orders them in decreasing value instead when the account settles. The first $105 charge hits your account causing you to be overdrawn and adding a $35 overdraft fee, then the two additional charges add an additional $35 fee each. So instead of settling the charges in order and being charged one $35 fee, they charge three $35 fees. And if you can&#x27;t bring your account positive in time? Another fee, naturally.<p>It&#x27;s been a while since I experienced this, but I feel for people who are less financially well off like I once was who still have to deal with this. I think banks now make it an option to disallow overdrafts, but by default they&#x27;re allowed to &quot;avoid embarrassment&quot; when shopping.",1449266010

The same quizzes were basically given to us repeatedly until our speed improved for the entire year. Later on, they intended for this to serve as a sort of placement test for math. I was pretty much always the slowest one, because I would get more stressed when a time limit was given (something around 2 minutes for 60 questions) and I didn&#x27;t approach it as memorization like many of the other students did. My teachers were convinced that I was unable to learn math because my speeds at answering those questions were not improving as much as those of other students and most of the time I was not able to finish the quizzes. But as soon as my parents requested for the school to give me a normal test they found that none of those problems even existed for me. Afterwards, they ended up moving me to a class that was a lot less focused on just doing the work quickly and that put me ahead of where many of my peers were. I think that if everybody else had been taught in an environment like that were time was not a factor in your grade they would have a much better understanding of the concepts of math and would also find it easier to learn how to do the actual math than how to memorize the answers to repetitive problems.",1449265710

On-line education, I think, has the potential to be very transformative.  Self-driving electric cars could also have a very positive effect on the world as well (including solving the &quot;last mile&quot; problem with train travel). There&#x27;s also a lot going on of course with bioengineering, and while I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily equate this with silicon valley, Stanford, Berkeley, and UCSF are of course highly relevant research institutions.  And let&#x27;s not discount the advances in distributed computing in making all of the above possible, some of which did come from silicon valley companies.<p>Of course, just because these things may greatly improve the quality of life doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;ll create jobs.  They may destroy them, and while so far people have found new industries and jobs to replace the ones that become obsolete, I suppose there&#x27;s no guarantee this will continue to be the case in the future.",1449265089

10679341,comment,10677702,10678411,0,0,btilly,,,"Well, both points of view have a point.<p>The central idea of Unix is that everything is a file.  Files are just streams of bytes on disk.  Most happen to be text.  Text is just streams of lines.  And then you write a bunch of simple tools that handle files, bytes, and lines, and they will combine really well for more complex tasks.<p>However this was (and in many corners still is) a radical idea.  The natural tendency in virtually every other system, from the Macintosh to IBM mainframes, was to store data in various structured records.  Whether we&#x27;re talking resource forks or records, you always, always, always add structure of various kinds.  The idea of just scanning through bytes to find, say, the end of a record is shockingly inefficient.<p>So we have the point of the article.  HFS+ breaks Unix.  If you don&#x27;t see that, then you don&#x27;t actually understand Unix.  The filesystem ignores one of the founding central concepts, with the result that the entire Unix toolkit and way of thinking about the world doesn&#x27;t work.  Standard utilities, scripts, etc don&#x27;t know that resource forks exist, and will do the wrong thing with them.  If you walk into OS X and are told, &quot;It&#x27;s Unix under the hood&quot;, well that is a lie.  It really isn&#x27;t.  You can work within it and only do Unix things and it will work, but as soon as you access things from elsewhere in the Apple ecosystem, things break in ways that they wouldn&#x27;t in, say, Linux.<p>But we also have your point of view.  There are very good reasons that HFS+ works the way it does.  And it is integrated into the UI in ways that date back decades.  And THIS is true.  OS X was an attempt to put a Macintosh UI on a fork of Unix.  And preserving central concepts of Unix really were not as important as making the UI work right.  With the same features.  With data being reasonably easy to port between the two systems, and programs not unnecessarily different.<p>Both points of view are valid.  Which one matters depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do.  Furthermore it is natural, not stupid, that a person who has just had a major plank pulled out from under their way of understanding the world tends to have a strong emotional response.<p>&quot;OMG, you broke everything!  The tools that I rely on don&#x27;t work and I have no idea what else is broken!&quot;  This is an extremely common response.  This is one of the reasons why it can be hard for programmers to switch languages and environments.<p>As it happens, I personally understand both points of view.  I have over 20 years of experience with both Macs and Unix.  This is typed on an Apple laptop.  But fundamentally I agree with the article.  Apple broke Unix.  I recognize that there is no solution at this point, and I mostly confine myself to living within the Unixy parts of the system.  But HFS+ got it wrong and is not well integrated with the command line.  I mean look at this.  If you have myfile you can look at myfile.  Then ls myfile/..namedfork and get an error.  Then ls $file/..namedfork/rsrc and see more stuff???  And I can only know to do this if I know it is there to be seen???<p>That&#x27;s just broken.",1449265087

First, it was used to store all graphical data on disk until it was needed, then retrieved, drawn on the screen, and thrown away. This software variant of virtual memory helped Apple to reduce the memory requirements of the Apple Lisa from 1 MB to 128 KB in the Macintosh. Second, because all the pictures and text were stored separately in a resource fork, it could be used to allow a non-programmer to translate an application for a foreign market, a process called internationalization and localization. And finally, it could be used to distribute nearly all of the components of an application in a single file, reducing clutter and simplifying application installation and removal.&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork</a>",1449263751

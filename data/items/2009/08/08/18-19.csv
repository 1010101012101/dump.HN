When people relentlessly and shamelessly manipulate situations to deter me from telling them something, and I can afford to wait, I'll wait for an opening.  It's like dealing with a military adversary who interprets truth as aggression.  You don't strike when they're posturing right off your coast.  You wait until their navy is in port and their planes are on the ground, and you hope they won't go to the trouble of punishing you, or that they calm down before they manage to muster a retaliatory strike.  I don't feel guilty about lying under such circumstances.  They're demanding to be lied to, and I'm telling them the truth against their will.  Whether I'm doing them a favor by ultimately telling the truth or just telling the truth for my own selfish reasons, I figure they share responsibility for the lies I tell in the meantime.",1249756545

749629,comment,749545,749545,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is one of the fastest media turnarounds I've seen in a recession.<p>IIRC, the 2001 recession didn't end in the media until later 2004 and early 2005, with the sales of Flickr and Del.icio.us and the development of FaceBook and YouTube.  I remember that I didn't even look for sumer internships in 2003 because I figured the market was so bad nobody would hire a mere intern, and about half the companies I approached in 2004 said ""We liked your resume, but we're not hiring now.""  In 07 (after this had all ended), I talked with a fellow computer programmer at a fencing class, and found out he was making <i>half</i> what I was because he had graduated into the sluggish job market of 04 instead of the growth market of 05.<p>In the 91 recession, I recall the media being very subdued and depressed right up until Netscape's IPO in 95.<p>I don't remember the 79-82 recession, but to hear my parents tell it, there was a widespread belief that America had permanently lost its technological edge, and things would <i>never</i> get better.  This perception didn't change until around 1984, and even through my childhood in the 80s, I remember recurrent fears that we'd lost our economic supremacy to the Japanese.<p>The only recession I can think of where people started proclaiming ""We've turned the corner; happy days are here again"" a mere year after it started was the Great Depression.  If you read <a href=""http://newsfrom1930.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsfrom1930.blogspot.com/</a>, it sounds almost exactly like something you could read in the newspapers today.<p>That alone makes me suspicious of this recovery.  The point of a recession is so you <i>stop doing what you're doing</i> and find new uses for your labor and capital; that hasn't happened so far.  In all the recessions above, that's what brought the country out of it: new markets opened up and absorbed all the workers that were laid off by the old ones.  I haven't seen that yet (though there are some interesting developments in mobile and in the revival of hardware hacking); mostly we've seen government attempts to paper over the inefficiencies in old industries with taxpayer dollars.",1249756333

They have made some dumb decisions that are getting a good amount of press coverage in tech circles, but the general iPhone user doesn't care about most of that.<p>I also don't think the article's author made a good case for iPhone development being as bad as gambling. Writing software for any platform can look like a crap-shoot from the outside. But success depends on a good product and a market to be served. Many of the iPhone apps are neither so that makes it more difficult to determine what the chances of success are.<p>I think that iPhone development has a higher chance of success than for any other current platform.

I don't know how much Shockwave supports those things, if it does at all, but I'd imagine Unity is a lot more focused on advanced features. It's not the Source engine, but it's advanced enough to build stand alone and console games, with the web as one option for deployment.

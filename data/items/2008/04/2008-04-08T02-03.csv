157427,comment,157357,157384,0,0,Jesin,,,"The <i>real</i> question is, how does ""academic performance"" correlate with actual proficiency?  In AP Computer Science, probably not much.  I'm taking the test soon (trying to skip the course and go on to fun stuff).  At least half the review book is about the Java standard class library.  Much of the remainder is Java syntax and semantics and the brain-damaged system that Java programmers call ""good object-oriented design"".  Oh, and another thing: chapter 5 of the review book has a section called ""The Software Development Life Cycle"".  The first subsection of that is titled ""The Waterfall Model"".  After explaining the waterfall model, it proceeds to completely neglect the existence of any other software development model.<p>One of the most noticeable differences between A and AB is that in AB, you go into algorithms and big O notation in much more depth, and you do some work with implementations of binary trees and such.  When they cut out AB, they are leaving what is essentially an AP Introduction to Java.<p>It's sad that this passes off as computer science.  I'm taking the test so I can hopefully skip the course and move on to fun stuff that has APCS as a prerequisite.  Fun stuff like AI.  AI, the class where Python and Ruby are the default languages, and you get to use other things if you want, like Lisp.<p>(I found this out when I still didn't know much about Lisp, saw someone using it, and laughed at the stupid, old language with all the parentheses.  The guy tried to explain that Lisp is a good language, but I wasn't convinced.  Later I independently stumbled on some of PG's essays, and I <i>was</i> convinced.)",1207621023

157423,comment,157357,157395,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""How well does the SAT I predict first-year college grades? The College Board and ETS conduct periodic studies of the SAT I. This usually involves examining the relationship between test scores and first-year college grades, generally expressed as the correlation coefficient (or r value). The College Board's Handbook for the SAT Program 2000-2001 claims the SAT-V and SAT-M have a correlation of .47 and .48, respectively, with freshman GPA (FGPA). This number is deceptive, however. To determine how much of the difference in first-year grades between students the SAT I really predicts, the correlation coefficient must be multiplied by itself. The result, called r squared, describes the difference (or variation) among college freshman grades. Thus, the predictive ability (or r squared) of the SAT I is just .22, meaning the test explains only 22% of the variation in freshman grades. With a correlation of .54, high school grades alone do a better job, explaining almost 30% of the variance in first-year college performance.""<p><a href=""http://www.fairtest.org/facts/satvalidity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fairtest.org/facts/satvalidity.html</a>",1207620645

157420,comment,157269,157269,0,0,benreesman,,,"While I agree that Ruby (in the form of MRI) is pretty limited in the kinds of production applications it's ready to support, I feel just as strongly that Python is an evolutionary dead end.<p>Personally I predict that JRuby (which addresses most of the issues listed in TFA) will become the mainline production Ruby. It runs adequately fast, and has JVM threading, meaning that ceteris paribus it is 'fast enough' for the largely IO-bound tasks that make up web-programming. And when you program in JRuby you find yourself leaning on the Java libraries for most of the heavy-duty stuff (say what you like about Java, I certainly do, but the libraries are abundant and abundantly production-worthy). Ultimately, when you've got lambda and reasonably low-impedance hash tables then you can make everything else, so there's a future for Ruby.<p>Python on the other hand is a lost cause. Objects are a valid and important ingredient in a balanced diet of programming abstractions, but 'object-oriented programming' is for idiots or assholes or worse. Objects  as a first-class language feature are nice-but-optional, I've worked on large C systems written in an object oriented style (one was a simulation, another was a widget toolkit, both had 'object' as a meaningful native domain concept). First-class functions OTOH are not optional, without them you've designed a language for infants. If you are designing a modern high-level programming language and you choose to cripple lambda (either because you've made regrettable decisions about your syntax that prevents their expression, or because you want to put training-wheels on the language itself, or LOL both) then you're an asshole, full stop. Python's scoping is tragic, at least Larry and Brendan had the humility to admit they fucked up and add reasonable scoping. GVR isn't wrong, 30 years of hard-won experience with correct lexical scoping is. If you think Scheme is wrong then I've got news for you: you are. Funny, now that I think about it it's not even about right and wrong anymore, it's about 'Pythonicity', which basically means that not only is GVR never wrong, if you don't agree then you're some kind of barbaric programming-language outsider. God I can't wait for a good example of Python (and more importantly the frigid, self-righteous, under-endowed Python community, I'm looking at you Paul Prescodd) to come into direct competition (- lisp epsilon) in a measurable, documented way.<p>At least Ruby and Javascript know that (- lisp epsilon) is the place to be, and they're both in the process of trying to add enough curly-braces to make themselves palatable to Java-refugees and no more.<p>Just remember: Python's not wrong, you are.<p><a href=""http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-must-self-be-used-explicitly-in-method-definitions-and-calls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-must-self-be-used...</a>",1207620434

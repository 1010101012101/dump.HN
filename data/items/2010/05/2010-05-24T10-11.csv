1374270,comment,1374186,1374186,0,0,btilly,,,"Feel free to ignore that article IF you know what you are doing.  Joel has a lot of opinions, that usually sound really good, and only some of them have any validity.<p>For example the Netscape codebase that he complained about went on to become Mozilla, which was the base for Firefox, which has done pretty well.  Furthermore there was actually no choice about rewriting the original - once Netscape pulled out the bits that were owned by other companies they didn't have running code.  When the only code you've got clear rights to won't run, drastic measures are called for.<p>For another example, Perl 5 was a complete rewrite of Perl 4 from scratch.  The result was a much more powerful, extensible, and simpler language.  (Yes, Perl 4 was grammatically much more complex than Perl 5.)  Perl 5 has been far more successful than Perl 4.  (Some 15 years in the result is creaky, but there are still a lot of people using it.)<p>On the flip side I've encountered some true disasters caused by the refactoring mantra.  When you start refactoring in place, it is like you're living in a construction zone.  Worse yet, as you reconstruct it, your opinions on how to write it will change, and you're likely to change how you're refactoring it.  After a few generations of this, you get a real mess.<p>That said, <i>usually</i> refactoring is a better idea than a rewrite.  There are a <i>lot</i> of examples where complete rewrites have lead to major disasters.  (If I'm feeling snarky I'd  use Perl 6 as an example.)  And businesses have real cause for concern about spending years rewriting a system, with the end result that they get back to where they started but with more bugs.<p>Furthermore be warned that the second attempt to write a piece of software is notoriously hard to do right.  Look at <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SecondSystemEffect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SecondSystemEffect</a> for a description of some of the pitfalls.  So be very, very cautious about starting such an effort.<p>All of that said, if the code is a big mess 2.5 years in, then you probably have something else going wrong.  In my experience good software developers in a good environment don't generally wind up in that much trouble that fast.  I'm not a big fan of assigning fault.  But odds are good that neither developers nor management are blameless.  And if you've got the same developers, and same management, it would be silly to predict a significantly different result.<p>Still if you want to start a rewrite, the first question is whether or not you have good unit tests.  Because if you don't, then it will be much, much harder to be sure that your rewrite is doing the right thing.  Furthermore I can virtually guarantee that the act of trying to write tests for the existing system will give lots of opportunities to find significant improvements.<p>If you've brought it up to the point that you have a good set of unit tests, and you still think that the rewrite is necessary, then you'll be in a much better position to pursue that.  And if you still have pushback from management, well, it will be some time down the road from now, improving the code will have improved your skills, and hopefully the economy will be in good enough shape that a better job won't be that hard to find...",1274697325

But yes, wrapping any bit of data into a object is silly. Some things are just not objects. Others make for very awkward objects. My personal favorite is a result of an SQL query that JOINs multiple tables. Do you make each type of joon its own type or do you just dynamically extend the existing type a la JavaScript? I tend to do the latter but that does not work well in a lot of languages and goes against their intent at best.<p>Lastly, OOP need != class based inheritance.

Also, I believe that (at least at one point), objects could attach scripts to other objects.  So the family tree wouldn't work in all cases.<p>Internally Second Life calls their countermeasure the ""gray goo fence"" but I can't find many good descriptions of how it actually works online, except some mentions that the restrictions on how much something can ""rez"" increase exponentially.  This link was the best description of it I could find:<p><a href=""http://alphavilleherald.com/2006/09/linden_lab_grey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alphavilleherald.com/2006/09/linden_lab_grey.html</a><p>I believe that, since the attack mentioned therein, they've done other things, such as restricting certain scripting functions to trusted people.  But folks have been known to find exploits anyhow.<p>Of course, feel free to correct me if you actually play Second Life.  I've only been following news of it from the outside.  I've never actually played it.<p>I've never understood why people are that worried about it with nanomachines, though.  We already have gray goo (though much of it, like algae, is green).  I mean, most single-celled organisms are capable of that kind of mass replication.  And they can be found pretty much everywhere already.

1374261,comment,1373969,1374223,0,0,barrkel,,,"If the problem can be solved with a finite state machine, you'd be silly to allocate an amount proportional to the input size, for sure. I wasn't arguing against the C approach; when I write compilers, I implement lexical analyzers as state machines all the time. (In my day job, I write C most of the time.) And even when state is in object fields, I copy them out into local variables before doing work, and copy them back in to fields after work, because it's much easier for a compiler to enregister locals than fields.<p>What I was actually arguing against is the idea that it's a good idea, in a GC environment, to avoid allocations when trying to improve performance. Allocations are extremely cheap in a GC environment; and automatic memory management by a precise copying collector is asymptotically faster than manual memory allocation on a per-item basis. (If you use pools or zones, you can get better manual memory management performance again, but then you lose allocation granularity.)<p>It's not clear that the code I posted uses more resources. It uses some time from the other processor (i7 920 has 8 logical cores, CPU usage as Windows measures it never exceeds about 17%) but it also completes sooner. The collector also has opportunity to use more optimized zeroing strategies, whereas I coded the manual array zeroing with an explicit loop.",1274696685

And overall, some 20% of the project is comments (~3M comments of ~15M lines code + comment, again ignoring blank lines).  And in spite of that, they appear to have several small things with no comments whatsoever.  Most of the other stuff is about what you'd expect, though:  the header files and assembly have the most comments, while the one-off programs have very few.<p>Still, I wonder what they used Lisp for?  Or why they used so many different tools?  I mean, Perl was all but made to replace awk & sed.  Did they have several people who did little one-off tasks in their favorite language when they were pressed for time?<p>Must be nice to get the tools you want, though, instead of being subject to absurd decisions by superiors (think ""Daily WTF material"").",1274695725

- the screenshots, i'll maybe make those lightboxes
- I'm not sure what you mean by high-level offer?
- the free forever is basically freemium and i'm trying to get away from that, but i'll consider it. I wondered about making a 7 day trial but like you say making the 'after 7 days you get put on your free account', or something like that.",1274695619

In my (limited) experience, it seems that the more interesting the technology is you're working on, the further you're typically removed from the users.<p>For instance, in a typical java consulting job, you're face to face with users all the time - but you're building a boring webapp. On the other extreme you could be building awesome technical tools but your real users are several time-to-market phases away.",1274695584

There are some exception - discrimination, the family medical leave act for new parents, retaliation against whistleblowers, and employees who refused to break the law. That's about it. Sure, an employee COULD file a lawsuit alleging that the employer broke one of those rules, but, if it's made up, they're all easily disproved except discrimination - which means nobody would bother with it, unless they had a grudge and money to burn, because there would be no payoff.",1274695463

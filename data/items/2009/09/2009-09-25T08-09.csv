One of the advantages of static typing (NOT starting a type war here, oh gods) is that you can transform error conditions from the run-time to the compile-time world. Earlier failure = cheaper failure, so this  is great.<p>I try to take this as far as I can. For instance, when writing Servlet code in Java, I define all my request parameter names in an enum, so that I can never misspell any lest the compiler tell me.",1253866290

(feedback on a project requested)",,"If you play World of Warcraft, please check out my latest project:<p>http://www.trackwarcraft.com/<p>The site quickly gathers data from the Armory, analyzes it, and presents it in an easy to glance at format. It's built on App Engine so hopefully it won't die under load like other similar tools. The site also lets you do parallel look ups of multiple characters. The big risk is if the Armory throttles my look ups -- I'm doing caching and back-off if I'm throttled. All of the URL fetches are parallelized which has shown to be an order of magnitude faster than other sites.<p>Any feedback is appreciated. The site could use some graphic design and UI work.

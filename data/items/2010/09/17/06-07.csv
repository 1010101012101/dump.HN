1700331,comment,1699080,1699080,0,0,ggchappell,,,"I use history a fair amount, and I've noticed an issue that none of these articles mention.<p>For history to be useful, you need to be able to reuse previous commands without giving them much thought; in the time it takes to think in detail about a command, you usually could have typed a new one without using history. As a result, commands that are reused via the history mechanism need to be ""safe"", with no hidden pitfalls.<p>For example, I use ""find"" a lot. A normal thing to do with ""find"" is to get a list of files to delete. Now, I could do that with ""find ... -exec rm"" or ""find ... xargs ... rm"", but that leaves me with an unsafe ""find"" command in my history, just waiting to bite me when I try to reuse it. If, some time later, I type ""!fi"" without thinking much about it, I might end up deleting some random files. Not good.<p>My solution, in this particular case, is <i>never</i> to do ""find ... rm"" on a single line. To remove a list produced by ""find"", I do ""find ..."" and then ""rm `!!`"". That runs the ""find"" command twice, of course, but the second time, everything has been cached, so it's very fast. (The real disadvantage is that the delay -- for the first ""find"" -- occurs in the middle of what is conceptually a single operation: after I've typed the ""find"", but before the ""rm"".)<p>So, has anyone else run into this issue? Thoughts? Other ways of dealing with it?",1284704874

I think a business owner should look at their desired customer base - the bagel shop it's a great play, because everyone buys quick food, and maybe Groupon users can shift to buying their bagels. For a slightly formal upscale cafe like Posies, you're trying to capture people's ""sit down at an expensive environment"" [1] time, which seems like it wouldn't convert as well long term. Groupon users might do it once for the experience, but people generally budget much less time and money for formal relaxing experiences, so you'd have a harder time displacing it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://posiescafe.com/wp/?page_id=76"" rel=""nofollow"">http://posiescafe.com/wp/?page_id=76</a> - Their coffee is compares reasonably to Starbucks at $2 to $3 a cup, their sandwiches around $9... they've got wines and beers from $3 to $7 per glass. I think this puts them in a tough spot where they're both upmarket/a slight luxury in most people's eyes, but still don't have crazy profit margins like an ultra-premium place.<p>My analysis:<p>I think Groupon is good for businesses that do high volume that want to replace people's regular common routine (a sandwich, hot dog, drink, whatever), low cost businesses that the Groupon demographic would keep using (inexpensive nail salons), and for places with no marginal cost (Chelsea Piers for instance, museums, other places where all the expenses are operating the place and there's no significant space constraints).

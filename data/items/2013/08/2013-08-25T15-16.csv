But there&#x27;s a good chance he does know about clicking that little icon, choosing &quot;settings&quot;, and seeing all of his big sister&#x27;s passwords when she&#x27;s out on a date and forgot to lock her computer.<p>Oh come on, <i>writing</i> a bookmarklet is not a fair comparison.  A fair comparison is the little brother googling &#x27;chrome passwords&#x27; and finding a link to chromereveal.com[1]  That&#x27;s a more interesting activity than wandering around settings.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6169439"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6169439</a>",1377446398

The maths in the first couple of chapters may be a little off putting - there&#x27;s an old idea that people write books that concern the problems they&#x27;re interested in even when trying to teach you something else - but you don&#x27;t really have to understand the mathy bits to benefit from the book.<p>If you&#x27;ve only done imperative programming before then it should be pretty eye-opening. If you&#x27;ve done functional programming before then it&#x27;s not quite as O_O inducing, but still worth a read.<p>Also, it&#x27;s effectively free so you can easily have a look yourself ^_^",1377446309

Hard-coded optional entropy will just be pulled out of the executable and these programs will still exist; randomly-generated new entropy for each installation of Chrome will have to be stored somewhere if it can&#x27;t come from the user, and it can be pulled out of there and these programs will still exist.  The only advantage that non-user-generated optional entropy will get you is that programs that do not specifically target <i>Chrome</i> passwords, and instead just dump the entire protected storage, will no longer be able to get Chrome passwords.<p>My personal suggestion would be for an optional user-provided password.

6272432,comment,6272079,6272079,9,0,kabdib,,,"Ex-Microsoftie here.<p>I&#x27;ve heard that Ballmer&#x27;s resignation was a surprise internally. Speculation is that &quot;something must have happened,&quot; possibly large shareholders gearing up for some kind of fight. The Surface RT thing cost MS about $40B in market share, so upset investors makes sense.<p>My /guess/ is that Ballmer was driven out by the RT mess, combined with the Win8 mess, combined with a realization that MS isn&#x27;t being directed very well from a technical standpoint. What will make Windows 9 a success? I just don&#x27;t see it happening.<p>This is going to sound crazy, but I think the problems at MS can be summarized in a few short bullet points:<p>1. The review system. This has already been talked to death, but it&#x27;s at the core of /why/ MS does the things it does, and it&#x27;s got to be fixed. It will take time, and it will be painful, but if they don&#x27;t address this then MS isn&#x27;t going to be around in 20 years, maybe even 10.<p>2. Getting rid of toxic people. Less discussed, but canning a largish number of bad personalities would help a lot. (I was engineering ways around some real prizes -- if a guy&#x27;s an incompetent jerk, it turns out you can architect him into being inconsequential!)<p>3. The build system. Hoo boy.<p>The way that Microsoft builds software hasn&#x27;t been discussed much, but it&#x27;s worth an in-depth look because if you can&#x27;t build software effectively then you can&#x27;t make it good. You can get fit and polish on a product /far/ more easily if you can turn it around and get rapid feedback, and Microsoft&#x27;s process here is /broken/.<p>Ballmer has said, &quot;Windows on everything,&quot; and right now if you&#x27;re working on a system of any complexity, if it&#x27;s not using Windows or one of its embedded variants you&#x27;re going to get into trouble. Windows is the only politically safe choice. &quot;Not Windows&quot; and &quot;Not able to run office&quot; has killed a lot of perfectly reasonable products.<p>Building big systems at MS is a many hours-long process. If you built every component on a typical developer-class workstation it would take a couple of days (36 hours on my last attempt), assuming you&#x27;ve checked out the code at a time when it will build without errors. Good luck with that.<p>So you build just the pieces you need, but on a real project even that will take hours (3-4 hours in my experience). So you start to cowboy things and try to patch up a way to get your builds down to a tolerable few minutes. But the shortcuts you take make build breaks more likely when you check in, so here&#x27;s what you do:<p>a) Find a working build. This might take a day or three, depending on whether things are broken or not.<p>b) Once you get that, stick with it as long as you can. Get your shit working.<p>c) When it comes time to check in, either<p>- sync minimally, try to ensure that things aren&#x27;t dramatically busted, and submit, or<p>- get a working build (back to (a) and maybe several days of hunting for a window), merge, and submit. Congratulations, you&#x27;re one of the good guys.<p>- Or check in blindly. That&#x27;s right, some people don&#x27;t even bother doing due diligence. Some groups have check-in barriers (required reviews, or build bots), but this adds additional hours even for simple changes.<p>The more dependencies you have, the worse things are; things are more likely to be broken, your own builds can take days, and every submit runs a high chance of breaking someone else. Staging a deliberate and breaking change across the dozens of depots is very difficult and time consuming.<p>If your organization&#x27;s development pace is glacial, /of course/ you are going to be deferring bugs and avoiding changes to huge and mysterious bits of software, because fixing stuff means breaks at many levels, and tons of lost time.<p>MS needs to invest heavily, and I mean HEAVILY, in ways to make their engineering staff more productive. None of this false pride about how long it takes to compile umpteen million lines of code. The fact is, engineering is at the coal face using picks and shovels and breathing bad air, and Ballmer doesn&#x27;t appreciate how having a frustrating, slow, error-prone and politicized build process has affected his ability to ship good products.<p>I&#x27;d say: Erect server farms so that every engineer can get a full build in five minutes.  Microsoft has smart people; I think they could do it, though it would involve throwing away a bunch of politically sensitive components. The model that has every developer attempt to build Windows on his own workstation should be utterly tossed.",1377445987

If you haven&#x27;t already, I encourage you to check out who&#x27;s supporting Proof School. We are fortunate to have their backing and advice.<p>First, to user interface... the pitch deck format of the current website is meant more as a landing page to pique curiosity and to solicit interest--it will change to a more familiar UX soon. Apologies if it&#x27;s slow or glitchy--we&#x27;re working on it. Go easy, guys!<p>Let me tell you a little more about Proof School, opening to students in 2015. The mission of the school is to attract students who self-identify as &quot;math kids&quot;--it will not be easy to get in. We&#x27;re looking for kids who may not see their peers except at summer math camps or at math circles, Julia Robinson Math Festivals, or math and CS events/contests at universities, MSRI and AIM during the school year, kids whose friends (some, at least) will wish they could go to Proof School, too, because the name says it all and they get it, kids who at 11, 12, 13, 14 are doing college and graduate level mathematics... and want to do it with kids and adults like them all year round, not just once in a while. These math kids are out there, and the response from them, their parents and other adult &quot;math kids&quot; who wish they&#x27;d had a Proof School when they were growing up is, frankly, massive. Here&#x27;s our mission statement: PROOF SCHOOL WILL OFFER AN UNRIVALED EDUCATION TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO EXCEL AT AND HAVE A PASSION FOR MATHEMATICS WHILE EQUIPPING THEM WITH KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND CHARACTER FOR SUCCESS IN LIFE.<p>Proof School will be elite but not elitist; no one who qualifies will be turned away because of financial need. It can also not only be about math: we will be offering a complete, UC A-G accredited curriculum, plus an explicit social/emotional learning (SEL) and mindfulness program, and partnering with some of the finest educational and cultural programs the Bay Area has to offer so that we educate the whole child. Math and CS will in some ways be the easy part, with teachers, professors, visiting instructors and peers teaching and learning from each other all in the mix. By contrast, we&#x27;ve identified the need to recruit the best teachers and academic leaders in the arts, hard sciences and humanities as our most pressing need going forward.<p>What more can I tell you... We&#x27;re launching a &quot;Math Community Hub&quot; in downtown SF in 2014 to get us in synch with academic and admissions calendars, pulling together all people interested in math at all levels. There&#x27;s lots more, but I won&#x27;t be able to respond to more comments here on HN (I&#x27;ve got a school to build!). If you&#x27;d like to add your great ideas to our efforts, please send me an email at ibrown[at]proofschool.org.

Maybe the contractor (onemine.com, if you&#x27;re curious) tried to bill the store owner more than agreed upon, the store owner refused, and this is the result.  Maybe the contractor left out some significant part of the site and the store owner wont pay until completion.

Firefox should have done it as an &quot;option&quot; rather than Yahoo doing the reverse. They successfully made this version of Firefox feel like a crapware toolbar analog that will sniff my browsing history and add no value to my browsing experience or life. Google, on the other hand, successfully did what Yahoo is trying to do. They released what was perceived to be a new browser: Google Chrome. Few had heard of Chromium before Google massaged the codebase it into Google Chrome, but everybody&#x27;s heard of Firefox. Yahoo should have developed the Super Awesome Browser 9000 (even if they used a previously unknown browser as a starting point -- Opera doesn&#x27;t count) instead of just slapping some branding on one of the most popular and famous browsers. Perhaps they also thought piggy backing on the Firefox branding was going to help them; it won&#x27;t.<p>I predict this version of Firefox will be adopted by almost nobody, primarily because nobody really cares about Yahoo; their search just isn&#x27;t up to snuff and their relevance is slowly fading.

Microsoft isn&#x27;t designed for that. It&#x27;s designed around packaged software and selling to large enterprises on 2-4 year replacement cycles.<p>In hardware, it&#x27;s a lot about supply chain management, something that Apple is basically the best in the world, far better than even Dell. A $900,000,000 write down is proof that MSFT doesn&#x27;t understand supply chain management. Amazon understands how to manage these things, and that&#x27;s why they often launch in the US first, then worldwide later. Google relies on hardware vendors to manage the supply chain and also has super limited distribution of their own devices to reduce risk.<p>One early report on the Surface said the Surface people didn&#x27;t even talk to the Xbox people during development. So, it&#x27;s not much of a surprise that the distribution didn&#x27;t go well if they didn&#x27;t really talk to the one team at MSFT that has done global hardware distribution.<p>In software services, you have to roll out updates more often. Microsoft is trying harder, but they need to get major releases out yearly and minor updates every couple months. Microsoft is going to do better at catching up in software services than hardware, but they aren&#x27;t there yet and it&#x27;s unclear that Ballmer and co. are totally willing to shift to a more web/net oriented mindset. Office 365 is probably the best example of executing on software services at scale and making a lot of money, but they got rid of guys like J Allard and Ray Ozzie who were pushing for devices and services almost 10 years ago.<p>Ultimately, Ballmer is not a devices guy or a services guy. He&#x27;s a very very smart businessman who cut his teeth selling boxed software and to large enterprises. Things that weren&#x27;t large enterprise or boxed software Windows were never going to get the same kind of support under him simply because that&#x27;s not his perspective by default.<p>It is going to be a real challenge for Microsoft to find someone who can rebuild MSFT for the future.",1377444123

The big thing it is in charge of (and the thing that I have seen many of them get wrong) is (a) keeping the child processes running/restating them when they fail and (2) performing graceful config or code reload. The OS has no business doing the latter and would have a very hard time doing the former.<p>In fact I have seen issues where gunicorn failed miserably simply because it did not handle a bad import in a child process. Tornado as of the latest version I had used (2.0 I think) did not have any ability to check for dead child processes. I am sure there are more examples of this done wrong than right.<p>This is an interesting option for several use cases but you still need a parent process to monitor things. Perhaps at some point upstart or systemd will get good enough to monitor multiple processes per daemon in real time. Until then, meh.<p>Edit: actually, one cool thing you can do with this is code reloading. You simply have your parent process start more workers that attach to the same socket, then kill the old ones. That way the idea of code or config reloading doesn&#x27;t need to be baked into every part of the worker.",1377443494

It sold seven and a half million cameras in its first two years and 50 million in the decade of the 1960s. It remains one of the most successful and profitable consumer products in the history of photography; it introduced baby-boomers to picture-taking.<p>(...)<p>It was actually an atrocious little camera, the Lomo of its day only without the quirky contriarian charm. The lens was horrible and the easy-to-load negative wasn&#x27;t big enough. But it was meant to be cheap to buy and easy to use, and it was both those things in spades (the &quot;Flashcube,&quot; like the film cartridge, was a stroke of genius in that respectfour small flashbulbs in an automatically rotating clear plastic box). The pictures, unfortunately, were an accurate reflection of what you saw through the minuscule, smeary viewfinder.</i><p>A commenter on the blog explains it in context:<p><i>I still curse the Kodak Instamatic.<p>I have restored, documented, digitized, and archived the many hundreds of photographs of my and my wife&#x27;s families from the 1880s to the present.  What was a treasure lode of memories and family histories collapsed, seemingly inspired by the song &#x27;New York Mining Disaster 1941,&#x27; with the introduction of the hated Instamatic.<p>Within just a few years Kodak had convinced most of our family that photography was not a skill worth learning, and lousy, blurry, washed-out pictures were actually good.<p>Even my oldest brother, a U.S. Army intelligence agent in Europe during the Viet Nam era, reported that most of the agents preferred cheap plastic Polaroid cameras (purchased out of petty cash) as G2&#x27;s government-issued Leicas were &#x27;too hard to use.&#x27;<p>The result is a real dearth of documentary photographs from the early to mid 1960s until the advent of decent P&S cameras beginning around 1980. If it wasn&#x27;t for the very few (three out of dozens) who owned Mamiya, Canon, and Pentax SLRs, our family would have very little from that period.

My top requirements were battery life, portability, and at least a 1366x768 screen (so that ruled out most 10&quot; systems). The Chromebook is working out really well; its 7-hour battery life is awesome. The 1015E probably would have been OK too, but its battery life wouldn&#x27;t have been as great. Kudos to Asus at least for loading Ubuntu on the 1015E-DS02.",1377443003

Windows 7 Starter was offered very grudgingly at much higher cost, and I suspect most netbook buyers would prefer XP.<p>All the OEMs knew this was coming.

But the U.S. made such a brouhaha about the Chinese doing it that when it turns out they were doing the same - but to a far greater scale, it turns out that there&#x27;s one rule for the U.S. (which is &quot;the rules don&#x27;t apply to us&quot;), and one rule for everyone else (which is &quot;the rules still apply to all you lot, because it&#x27;s our playground, and we make the rules&quot;).<p>Besides, this will blow over just as quickly as it blew up just like everything else did/does in the U.S. - the president will do something dumb that everyone can get up in arms about, like cheating on his wife with a pretty white intern who strips on the side to &quot;pay her way through college&quot; and all will be forgotten while the bible belt attempts to sacrifice him on the alter of Republicanism. Why? Because the U.S. loves their witch hunt... as long as they&#x27;re huntin&#x27; witches, they&#x27;re happy. The problem is, when they run out of witches to hunt, what are they going to do with themselves?<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ll sit back and roll my eyes because history has shown us that the U.S. is just that predictable.",1377442935

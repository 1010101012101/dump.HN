In most companies I&#x27;ve worked, those quarterly patent award ceremonies were where they trotted out all those folks who either had nothing else to do besides filing patents, or managers who put their names on the vague ideas their directs were working on. The rest of us were busy actually making the products.<p>I guess this also means those of us who refuse to participate in the patent system on ethical grounds are the least productive people in the world?",1422579526

8969874,comment,8968172,8969708,0,0,colordrops,,,"Reddit has both explicit ads, such as paid placement at the top, and side bar ads, as well as Reddit Gold, but these are not extensive enough to support costs and make a decent profit.  Reddit has nearly 200 million users and has taken almost 50 million in investment, and there is a lot of pressure to utilize the user base for marketing purposes.<p>Along with traditional explicit advertising models, internet marketing usually involves more subtle techniques such as seamless paid content interleaved with user content, as you see on Facebook and elsewhere.  Subtle and invisible marketing is especially important on Reddit, as forum users are not tolerant of paid content, as evidenced by the collapse of Digg, so the operators of Reddit have to keep up the impression of Reddit being pristine and untouched by marketers.<p>But Reddit has to make revenue, as they are a business and not a charity.  Reddit employees are mods of many of the default subreddits, and often post content to those boards that bubbles to the top of the front page.  The evidence trail is direct, as you can directly view an employee&#x27;s posts on their profile page.  It would be absurd for Reddit to not use modern internet marketing techniques to generate revenue.<p>Not only does Reddit support marketing through posts, but they also control the narrative of Reddit.  Just live television before it, advertisers are very sensitive to the content carried on the medium that their advertisements are part of, and use their dollars to influence what can and can&#x27;t be said in that channel.

Community dynamics change whenever there is a large influx of people. When that large influx is wealthy, strongly tied together, not a part of the existing community and commands the respect and deference of community officials, then those struggles become real.<p>I have no idea if this is true, but it may be that a community of neighbors that knew Alex well would have been less likely to call the cops, to give the police more information about his mental state, etc. and that those measures would have saved his life.<p>&quot;Class warfare&quot; is an apt term.

You would plug the video output from your 2D card into your 3D card, and then connect the output to your monitor.

Go ask Netflix if you can write a third party client for their service. Or Skype for that matter.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first in line if you can get rid of all the useless DRM/telecoms regulation/whatever that makes these companies think this is necessary, but Google is if anything doing less of that than their competitors. At least they have platform-independent HTML5 versions of pretty much everything.<p>You have to admit the schadenfreude is delicious.

8969842,comment,8968522,8969596,0,0,curun1r,,,"> > With Go, you never, ever have to write any OS-specific code.<p>> Okay. The article claimed otherwise: &quot;In Go, you can define different files for different operating systems that implement functionality depending on the operating system.&quot;<p>Both the article and the poster you&#x27;re replying to are correct. You almost never <i>have to</i> write OS-specific code, but you <i>can</i> write it if you feel there&#x27;s a benefit to it. Much like Node doesn&#x27;t make you write C++ code but allows you to do it when you feel it&#x27;s necessary. The article&#x27;s main point was, I&#x27;m assuming, alluding to Go&#x27;s build tags which are much more elegant than the traditional pre-processor directives used in the C/++ world. They give you a powerful expression language for targeting specific runtime environments that lets you separate out your OS-specific code in a very clean way.<p>When it comes to distributing an application, there&#x27;s another advantage that Go has over Node. One of the common ways that people are distributing server applications these days is as Docker images. It solves the problem of users needing to understand npm quite nicely for a Node application, but makes the distributable artifact significantly larger since it includes the bulk of an OS alongside the application code. With Go&#x27;s ability to create a statically-linked binaries, you can build your Docker images &quot;FROM scratch&quot; and images can be as small as 2.5m.",1422578624

I&#x27;m $100k+ in debt; I grew up poor. My parents live on a fixed income, I send them money every month and last year, in 2014, I made the least annual income I have made since 2003.<p>As a divorced father of two, who was fired from his last full time job, and can&#x27;t disclose due to NDA prior work, I&#x27;ve been self employed the majority of my adult life since 2006. Since September, I&#x27;m a former alcoholic, which is news to many - I had drank regularly since I was 18 and only recently realized I could correlate a bit of my drinking to early communication issues that resulted in the &quot;low end,&quot; classes in my first years of education.<p>I digress, though, as the first one in my family in three generations to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree, life in college and out is hard. In my family, during my &quot;prime,&quot; my business expenses were over 100K per year in 2009 and 2010. However, things came crashing down and changed. It&#x27;s a long, long story. Drinking helps zero.<p>Now, my software is free, I filed a patent pending because I need credibility. The world is flat, as Thomas Friedman said, and growing more so. Ten years ago I spent $50K on my own tools. If I had known then that I&#x27;d need them in 2013, and 2014 again, I would have done what I&#x27;m doing now.<p>Made them free. Open source. Given it away, hoping that with better tools, everybody benefits. That&#x27;s the dream.<p>We got rejected by Ycombinator. I&#x27;ve worked with guys in the news way way more than I&#x27;ll ever be, and I tell a lot of stories, incidentally, most are true.<p>Thanks for reading, I love this site and learn from it daily.",1422578186

They bought a second-hand campervan so that they could go on holiday without paying for hotels, and could afford a house only thanks to old-school &quot;socialist&quot; policies here in Europe. They always fixed what they broke and always talked about the importance of using money wisely, for real things etc etc. They were also politically active, so I know how the sausage gets made, so to speak.<p>The result? I&#x27;ve always been rubbish at managing big sums of money. When my salary went over a certain threshold, I just stopped caring. I get anxious at the first sight of debt, yeah; but in many ways, that&#x27;s also a handicap because it stops me from effectively leveraging debt as an instrument of growth. I can&#x27;t get myself to talk about money with clients, and I&#x27;m thankful someone else does it for me. I used to spend days looking to save a few quid on this or that £20 gadget, and now I buy my cars from an expensive official dealer that is clearly overcharging me. When numbers go over a certain threshold, it just becomes &quot;funny money&quot; and my brain switches off. Right now I&#x27;m probably living beyond my means and balancing my budget by pure luck, I just have no idea.<p>Growing up poor can give you a certain inner fire and a sense of the importance of money in society; but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily give you a full picture, in the same way knowing how to develop a simple webapp with Django or Ruby doesn&#x27;t mean you know how to implement a scalable and highly-available system with queues, nosql, AWS orchestration and so on.

You might want to review your code on Github, so that you can address questions, off the top of your head. I wouldn&#x27;t change though. I highly suspect they just want to see if you know where you could have improved, etc. Rather than being some seasoned superstar who never makes mistakes. So a review on your part, then you can make comments about how you would change things now that you know more, etc.<p>Here is some general job search advice. Job hunting is more of a machine gun approach, where you try and shoot lots of things, rather than a sniper. I guess what I mean is, research and apply to 10 jobs, then you have a choice, and are not stressed if someone is being weird. Use excel or something, track your progress, write custom cover letters, do your research about the company, etc. When you don&#x27;t have a job, job hunting is your job, so spend your time wisely and try and make good shots. You have the control. This will likely lead you to negotiate harder, appear to have more confidence, etc. In the long run, if you don&#x27;t get it, there are tons of other opportunities out there. I once applied and was eventually hired for a public sector job, it took around 6 months to land it, tons of interviews, tests, phone calls, emails, security screening, etc. At the end, I just wanted the entire thing to be over with, one way or the other, so this phone call seems pretty minor, and I wouldn&#x27;t stress too much.",1422577900

That&#x27;s highly unusual for a Ruby library. It felt like a generated library, not like Ruby. When something wasn&#x27;t working as expected (which happened often), it was difficult to figure out what was going wrong and why.<p>As a heavy AWS user, I&#x27;ve felt much more comfortable using Fog, even though I only really use its AWS provider. That&#x27;s true even though I didn&#x27;t even get to take advantage of Fog&#x27;s multi-provider abstractions (basically just using it to make raw AWS API calls). Hopefully that&#x27;s all in the past and I should give it another look the next time I&#x27;m doing that stuff in Ruby. Fog also gave <i>much</i> better control over a lot of the details that are important when doing stuff in production, like timeouts and keep-alive settings.<p>The 2nd example that comes to mind is the AWS Flow framework for Ruby: <a href=""https://github.com/aws/aws-flow-ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aws/aws-flow-ruby</a><p>Flow does things like create global methods ( <a href=""https://github.com/aws/aws-flow-ruby/blob/master/aws-flow/lib/aws/decider.rb#L60"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aws/aws-flow-ruby/blob/master/aws-flow/li...</a> ) and its DSL abstraction just doesn&#x27;t feel right. It tries too hard to make it feel like you&#x27;re just running Ruby code, and it&#x27;s tough to determine how it uses SWF under the hood. It&#x27;s such a large abstraction on top of SWF that it basically means you can&#x27;t write parts of your app in anything other than the Flow frameworks for Java or Ruby. But then, the other major SWF framework I&#x27;ve seen (<a href=""https://github.com/sclasen/swf4go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sclasen/swf4go</a>) also locks you in. So maybe it&#x27;s just a shortcoming of SWF that it&#x27;s not usable without a big abstraction layered on top of it?<p>From what others are saying, it sounds like the newer stuff is in much better shape. That&#x27;s very encouraging!<p>Regardless, I think you&#x27;ve made a great decision in taking over aws-go. I have very high hopes for its future :)",1422577165

8969770,comment,8968915,8968915,0,0,acgourley,,,"John Law&#x27;s response follows. [1]<p>I’ve been following the Talbot thread, and have very mixed feelings. Here’s my 2 cents for what it’s worth.<p>“When I moved to Frisco (g’head – take that one on!) in 1976 as a California born, Midwest raised 17 year old juvie runaway living on the streets and crashing at Haight Ashbury Switchboard referred beds, Bernal (as most neighborhoods at that time) was a very different place. Though I never actually lived on the Hill, I’ve lived all around it – Bayview, Mission, Portola, as well as a half dozen other hoods. I’ve hiked, hung out at and slept (not always with the same people) on Bernal off & on for over 3 decades. The hippies I met back then, some toothless drug addicts, some gentrifying householders, all told me the same thing: “Party’s over kid, ya missed it.” Well, they were full of crap on that one. The story of this town as with all towns is one of constant change.<p>I worked at the York Theater (now the Brava) in 1979/80. The Mission, parts of Bayview, North Beach etc., were cauldrons of crazy energy and underground experimentation for me and my crowd. Each Saturday, Mission Street from 14th to Army was bumper to bumper low riders of the most astonishing detail exquisite paint jobs imaginable. La Raza was feeling it, murals and street art starting to pop up everywhere. The old neighborhood townies bitched incessantly about the hippies, cholos (and later the Punks and Gays) and how they were destroying San Francisco.<p>Well, in a sense they were right. The new waves were washing away the old, and the old that was being supplanted was far from valueless. l’ve worked in the trades with many of those old townies for years. I would get hints of this past world from the old timers still in the trades when I started. Their world was one of drag racing at Ocean Beach, Irish wakes and marriages at Mission Dolores (yes, the Mission was largely Irish before the wave of Latino immigration and white flight in the 60’s) or St. Paul’s up the hill, diving off Lefty O’Doul Bridge, working the docks, machine shops and produce markets or, as juvenile delinquents, pinching stuff from those markets…<p>I stopped at Reds Java Hut with my forman at Ad-Art Electrical Sign Co, George Edwards for lunch a few times in the mid-80’s. Red, at that time in his 70’s, was a big man with a ready laugh and short temper. He would loudly, but good naturedly berate George, also a big tough guy, when we came in: “HEY KID!! whaddaya want? A free burger! Ya ain’t gonna get it here, boy!” Evidently my boss and his Irish street gang would try and swipe candy bars at Reds back in the 50’s!<p>This was the world buried by the new waves over the 60’s and 70’s. And the factories closed, shipping left and by the time I arrived, much of the city was abandoned commercial buildings, boarded up neighborhoods and a great deal of street crime and ingrained poverty.<p>To me it was a wonderland. Very cheap rent and restaurants made living and creating here easy. All sorts of bizarre and compelling things were growing in that beautiful wasteland. Even so, you’d be mugged for certain in Precita Park if you traversed it regularly. Cortland was a dangerous street and you simply did not go near Garfield Park at night. The gangs owned it. In 2 years of selling popcorn at the York Theater (24th at York St, 1979/80) I witnessed two full on gang fights, saw the aftermath of dozens of serious assaults, and watched as patrons of the theater lost, on average 3-4 cars a week to auto theft. Hampshire at 24th shared the honor of most auto thefts for several years with some street in Newark NJ.<p>I read Talbot’s book and quite enjoyed it. I remember first-hand much that he recounts therein. He is right in his Bernal reverie on one count for sure: The new wave on average, are wealthier. I know many in the tech scene. I’m a partner in Laughing Squid, one of the very early internet “social media” experiments that has gone on to some notice. The “techies” have their own creative wonderland they are building here – much of it is hard for those not initiated to see or understand. I can’t fairly be mad at them for their enthusiasm for MY town….<p>Many of my closest long time friends ARE being pushed out by the new wave, and they are rightfully as pissed off about it, as the Townies were before. I am very sad about that and we are losing some very important things as that tide recedes and leaves the artists, working class and poor immigrants beached (some for the better) in Oakland and beyond. With a few wrong breaks, I would be pushed out too.<p>San Francisco is not a place that I would hitchhike to nowadays, couch surf and live cheaply in as I met other broke newbies who want to shake things up. I would end up in Oakland. But for the people that do come and can afford it, I think Frisco is still a pretty awesome place. And for those of you lucky or smart enough to have dug in on Bernal, my congratulations.<p>[1] source from this article where it&#x27;s at the bottom: <a href=""https://bernalwood.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/neighbor-david-talbot-shares-what-he-really-thinks-of-his-new-neighbors-in-precitaville/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bernalwood.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/neighbor-david-t...</a>",1422577124

8969740,comment,8968722,8968722,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"I wholeheartedly agree. Our consumer-led marketing manipulated society casts a massive shadow over the reality of just how much things cost and no sum of money is too big. When you&#x27;re a child or teenager, you don&#x27;t have the pressures of life on your shoulders, you don&#x27;t realise just how hard things can be. You have no bills, little to no responsibilities and everything is so much easier.<p>I actually had this conversation with my wife the other day. We decided we would raise our child to be aware of just how much things cost and teach him from a young age to be successful in life and get the things you want, you have to work for them and that nothing is ever handed to you.<p>This is why I think it is important to instil good values into your children from a young age and teach them the importance of money, how it is earned and where it is spent. When they&#x27;re old enough to do things for themselves, encourage them to earn money through chores but also ensure they do some chores for free. Maybe give them a few dollars for mowing the lawn, but make them do the washing up and clean their room for free.<p>When I was about 10, my father who is a small engine mechanic gave me a full can of fuel, a whipper snipper and a mower. He then suggested I go door-to-door and ask people in the street if they would like their lawn mowed for $15 (for a small yard). When the fuel ran out, I had to use my own earned money to buy more fuel, oil (for two stroke mixture) and whipper snipper cord. I remember one stage I had like $40, but I spent half of that on fuel, oil and cord.<p>Because of that experience my father taught me, I believe it actually made me grow up to be more conscious of money and taught me the basics of running a business and managing money. I have very little personal debt, I earn an okay salary and have some savings. Sadly, we&#x27;re seeing the current generation getting into massive amounts of debt thanks to credit cards, expensive electronic items and even in-app purchases on our cellular phones.<p>I learned to be more budget conscious when I go shopping with my wife because I grew up going to the store with my mother who knew to go at a certain time of day to get discounted; fruit, meat and vegetables. The importance of buying in bulk, the importance of knowing what you want to buy by writing a shopping list before you even set foot in the store.<p>When I was growing up, money was a taboo subject that my parents didn&#x27;t like discussing in-front of me and my siblings. I would see my parents sometimes argue about money, not very often, but I didn&#x27;t really know first-hand some of the stresses until I got older and paid more attention. I wish my parents involved me and my sisters in the budgeting process so we could all be a little more grateful for what we had and the sacrifices my parents had to make raising us.<p>Honestly, I think the whole money subject should be taught in school. I know some schools do to an extent, but children need to be taught the honest basics and realities of everyday life financial responsibilities as an adult and the consequences of things like debt.",1422576609

The Optimists, whose patron saints were Drake and Sagan, believed in a universe crawling with gentle intelligence—spiritual brethren vaster and more enlightened than we, a great galactic siblinghood into whose ranks we would someday ascend. Surely, said the Optimists, space travel implies enlightenment, for it requires the control of great destructive energies. Any race which can&#x27;t rise above its own brutal instincts will wipe itself out long before it learns to bridge the interstellar gulf.<p>Across from the Optimists sat the Pessimists, who genuflected before graven images of Saint Fermi and a host of lesser lightweights. The Pessimists envisioned a lonely universe full of dead rocks and prokaryotic slime. The odds are just too low, they insisted. Too many rogues, too much radiation, too much eccentricity in too many orbits. It is a surpassing miracle that even one Earth exists; to hope for many is to abandon reason and embrace religious mania. After all, the universe is fourteen billion years old: if the galaxy were alive with intelligence, wouldn&#x27;t it be here by now?<p>Equidistant to the other two tribes sat the Historians. They didn&#x27;t have too many thoughts on the probable prevalence of intelligent, spacefaring extraterrestrials— but if there are any, they said, they&#x27;re not just going to be smart. They&#x27;re going to be mean.<p>It might seem almost too obvious a conclusion. What is Human history, if not an ongoing succession of greater technologies grinding lesser ones beneath their boots? But the subject wasn&#x27;t merely Human history, or the unfair advantage that tools gave to any given side; the oppressed snatch up advanced weaponry as readily as the oppressor, given half a chance. No, the real issue was how those tools got there in the first place. The real issue was what tools are for.<p>To the Historians, tools existed for only one reason: to force the universe into unnatural shapes. They treated nature as an enemy, they were by definition a rebellion against the way things were. Technology is a stunted thing in benign environments, it never thrived in any culture gripped by belief in natural harmony. Why invent fusion reactors if your climate is comfortable, if your food is abundant? Why build fortresses if you have no enemies? Why force change upon a world which poses no threat?<p>Human civilization had a lot of branches, not so long ago. Even into the twenty-first century, a few isolated tribes had barely developed stone tools. Some settled down with agriculture. Others weren&#x27;t content until they had ended nature itself, still others until they&#x27;d built cities in space.<p>We all rested eventually, though. Each new technology trampled lesser ones, climbed to some complacent asymptote, and stopped—until my own mother packed herself away like a larva in honeycomb, softened by machinery, robbed of incentive by her own contentment.
But history never said that everyone had to stop where we did. It only suggested that those who had stopped no longer struggled for existence. There could be other, more hellish worlds where the best Human technology would crumble, where the environment was still the enemy, where the only survivors were those who fought back with sharper tools and stronger empires. The threats contained in those environments would not be simple ones. Harsh weather and natural disasters either kill you or they don&#x27;t, and once conquered—or adapted to— they lose their relevance. No, the only environmental factors that continued to matter were those that fought back, that countered new strategies with newer ones, that forced their enemies to scale ever-greater heights just to stay alive. Ultimately, the only enemy that mattered was an intelligent one.<p>And if the best toys do end up in the hands of those who&#x27;ve never forgotten that life itself is an act of war against intelligent opponents, what does that say about a race whose machines travel between the stars?<p>The argument was straightforward enough. It might even have been enough to carry the Historians to victory—if such debates were ever settled on the basic of logic, and if a bored population hadn&#x27;t already awarded the game to Fermi on points. But the Historian paradigm was just too ugly, too Darwinian, for most people, and besides, no one really cared any more. Not even the Cassidy Survey&#x27;s late-breaking discoveries changed much. So what if some dirtball at Ursae Majoris Eridani had an oxygen atmosphere? It was forty-three lightyears away, and it wasn&#x27;t talking; and if you wanted flying chandeliers and alien messiahs, you could build them to order in Heaven. If you wanted testosterone and target practice you could choose an afterlife chock-full of nasty alien monsters with really bad aim. If the mere thought of an alien intelligence threatened your worldview, you could explore a virtual galaxy of empty real estate, ripe and waiting for any God-fearing earthly pilgrims who chanced by.",1422576551

8969733,comment,8966895,8966895,0,0,FLUX-YOU,,,"The news would go nuts. It&#x27;ll be all anyone talks about on social media and internet forums. Every comedian will have an alien joke. Books, movies, and games will be written about them. Talking about the aliens will carry the same sophistication as talking about the weather. Conspiracy theorists and the paranoid-delusional will confirm their worst fears and blame the government. The government will roll out a Department of Extraterrestrial Security and enforce more airport screenings. A lot of people would buy telescopes. Benedict Cumberbatch will act as one. Potheads will make first contact according to themselves. The stock market will go up (but I can&#x27;t tell you why -- that&#x27;s insider trading). People will do cosplay of them. People will draw porn with them. Xkcd will do a What-if and a comic or three. Python will add &#x27;import aliens&#x27;. Silicon Valley will spawn at least 4 new startups related to speculative data machine learning about their browsing habits once we show them our internet. Colbert will do a special about being abducted and he never really wanted to leave anyway. John Stewart will claim that Fox News were aliens all along and this is the second wave. Fox News will find a way to blame Obama and John Boehner will finally shed his ninth skin.<p>But that&#x27;s just my take on it.",1422576482

This is usually exactly the same as the US edition, except it is paperback and costs a lot less.<p>For instance, take ""Introduction to Algorithms"" by Cormen, et al., used in one of the MIT OpenCourseware algorithms courses. $20-30 vs about $130 for the US edition.<p>Or take Apostol, ""Calculus"", used in the OpenCourseware calculus with theory course. $20-30 vs. $150-200 for the US edition.<p>Or how about Resnick's ""Introduction to Special Relativity"", used in an OpenCourseware relativity course. $15-25, compared to $120 for the US edition.<p>In all cases I'm talking about new books, latest edition, not used or older editions.<p>The low end of the price range for the international editions comes from buying from an oversee seller, with India usually having the cheapest, although occasionally a Chinese seller is the cheapest. The book will often only be $5-10 from such sources, but shipping will be high. In most cases, there are also a couple of sellers in the US. The books will typically be around $20 from a US seller, but shipping will be much lower than from India.<p>You can find these deals via Biblio.com or AbeBooks.com.",1305442777

What are we going to be using those cores for?  Embarrassingly parallel problems like 3D rendering, OS eye candy and video processing and compression.  Multi user HD video chat is going to be happening really soon for really cheap.  That's quite disruptive.

Then you have to figure out what in detail happens - I ended up doing this by putting ""begin; raise StandardException.new; rescue => e; puts e.backtrace; end;"" into the ""hot"" methods to get call stacks and then went on to read the code involved.",1305441800

2549467,comment,2549268,2549268,2,0,code_duck,,,"This already exists! An iPod Touch with Skype on wifi is the best home phone I've ever owned. But would I really call it a mobile phone, or consider a wifi only phone? I spend a lot of time in my car, and of course don't have stable wifi in there. I tried to pretend my iPod was a wifi-only phone for a few months, but it didn't work out for me. Perhaps wifi availability is good enough in densely populated urban areas, but is using random wifi across the city secure?<p>It will be interesting to see what Microsoft does with Skype and the carriers, though. MS is not in a very strong position in the mobile phone market, and I can't imagine the carriers like Skype at all, as charging per minute and per text rather than by the MB for data is much more profitable.  The neutered, 3G only version of Skype that came with ym Verizon phone, which counts US domestic calls against your normal calling plan, shows what Verizon thinks of Skype. That's ""Skype Mobile"", there's another Skype which works only on wifi. When you call Skype-to-Skype on ""Skype Mobile"", it dials a 1800 number in Atlanta, and the sound quality is terrible. On the same phone, the wifi Skype has markedly better sound quality. It seems to me that since I'm paying $25 a mo. for unlimited 3G data, I should be able to use the data to make Skype calls if I please. If Microsoft can make that happen, more power to them.",1305441386

A SIM card is designed to run on a GSM network.<p>Outside of a wifi area you would need to use some sort of network to transmit your data.. there really is no option other than a GSM/CDMA carrier.<p>Also, we have the problem of distribution now. Microsoft doesn't have the same retail presence that Apple has. Google proved that selling handsets direct to consumers doesn't work that well. Nokia closed down their stores in NYC, Chicago and London. Think of the retail stores that T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint etc have across the country... there is no way to compete with that.<p>The GSM protocol is design to handle voice data and is well optimized and uses surprisingly little bandwidth. Skype is much heavier on bandwidth in comparison. The skype protocol wasn't designed to be used as you walk through areas of low signal or for 1,000 users going through one cell phone tower at once. For simple voice data... the GSM protocol wins hands down.<p>If you want to imagine any Microsoft/Skype/Nokia/Windows 7 mash up.. what if they adapted the Skype p2p technology for use on handsets to allow you to connect through other handsets to get to a base station? This will allow you to route around network congestion, prevent dropped calls, reduce network infrastructure and increase network coverage.<p>Nokia makes the cell tower infrastructure through Nokia Siemens... If anyone could do this, it is Nokia. Imagine how hard carriers would push a p2p handset. </dream>",1305440405

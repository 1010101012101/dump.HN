A major assumption of Keynesian economics is that employment scales with production. Thus, if you stimulate aggregate demand, you will increase production, and thereby increase employment. This hasn't happened - aggregate demand and production have recovered, but employment has not.<p>The fact is, our economy is a lot more complicated than it used to be. Workers are not interchangeable cogs and expanding profits does not necessarily involve expanding employment. Stimulating demand in retail will not raise the employment of construction workers or realtors. Many employees produce nothing directly, but merely improve the value of capital [1] - increased profits don't demand hiring more employees, and reduced profits don't demand firing them.<p>Until economics catches up with the times, all we will get are silly ideas like ""invest in infrastructure"" and ""stimulate demand"". Really, you think jobs are moving to India because of their infrastructure? Lets get real here. I've done a little work for someone who created about 30 jobs in Pune. He drives for 2-4 hours on crappy roads to get from his house in Bombay to the office, only to discover that the power is out and no work can be done today. You think he'll come back to the US if you widen a few highways?<p>[1] I'm a good example. My labor is directly worth nothing - all of my companies profits are directly attributable to capital (a trading system + money in the brokerage account). My employment is an investment - I have a significant probability of increasing the value of that capital.",1298137994

Given n points in a plane , the number of Hamiltonian paths can be drawn is (n-1)!. One of these is minimum, and our optimum solution to TSP. If we distribute the frequencies of the lengths of these graphs, (is there a particular name for this graph?) we will find the probability of a particular length-range occurring. This graph, should be different for different complete graphs. So an improvement might simply be that the 'high ridges' on such graph of input of random sets given , lay towards the left sides of 'peak'.<p>><i>A useful property of a spacefilling curve is that it tends to visit all the points in a region once it has entered that region. Thus points that are close together in the plane will tend to be close together in appearance along the curve.</i><p>Or very far!

Anything that's free but is limited gets abused.<p>Free does not mean unrestricted. Degrees in law and medicine are highly sought in Denmark, and the universities raise the academic requirements for initial entry and continued study accordingly.<p>> 2. I would love to see some study in this but it is my belief that reducing the cost of higher education increases the earning potential of college graduates. When I went to university (in Australia) it certainly seemed to be the case that the earning potential difference between graduates and non-graduates wasn't anywhere as near as the difference in the US<p>Supposing there is a correlation, what is its relative significance? For example, Danish doctors are paid less than most of their US counterparts. But that is due to uniform salary standards in the public healthcare system.<p>> 3. Free systems create extra demand from people who don't really want to be there and are simply going for the lifestyle, which may in turn keep others who really want to go out<p>How so? If the academic standards are raised to compensate for higher demand, only the most talented and willful be able to complete their studies. On the contrary, in an educational system where money is often the gating factor, you lose talented people who cannot afford tuition.<p>> 4. Governments may pay per college student but those funds aren't distributed equally. When I went almost nothing was spent on first-year students. Most of that money was diverted to research activities, which brings into question the quality of education the government was paying for;<p>Professors are contractually obligated to spend a large percentage of their time on teaching. As a consequence, assuming you don't teach empty classrooms, the total teaching load across a faculty scales roughly with the number of students.<p>The first-year classes are cheaper to teach per student because classes are larger. But if you break everyone into groups of 15-20 people with their own TA (another professor or graduate student), the quality of the teaching doesn't suffer. In fact, the best teachers usually teach the first-year classes.<p>I don't see a difference here compared to US universities.<p>In Denmark there's no such thing as a research-only professorship supported by per-student government contributions, and equipment expenses and research assistant salaries are only covered at a very low level or not at all. My cousin is a biomedical researcher at the University of Aarhus, and his group spends an inordinate amount of time on applying for research grants to cover such expenses. That part is not very different from the US.<p>> 6. Demand will be increased by other countries. In Germany, for example, you have a lot of Brazilians who go there for free university, typically going there for 6-12 months prior to learn German.<p>That's a real and present problem but it can mitigated by stricter quotas. From talking to academics at Danish universities, my sense is that many Ph. D. programs are being overrun by Chinese students who are studious but not very talented. For various reasons, that hasn't happened at the undergraduate level.",1298137470

Where there might have once been a Chancellor and perhaps a Vice Chancellor, there's now a whole Office of the Chancellor, a slew of Vice-Chancellors and Executive Vice Chancellors and Provosts and Deans and Associate Deans, all with staff, etc. Their pay has also increased, even relative to other university pay; the salary multiple of top-level administrators relative to a median professor in 2010 versus 1960 is much larger.<p>It seems to largely be a result of the professionalization of the administration; in ye olden days universities were largely self-run by the faculty, with Deans and Vice-Deans just being professors who moved up into that position, sometimes rotating in temporarily.

The first pass of optimizations focused on paralellizing the data access from memcache, getting it so the minimal number of queries were sent to memcache and the database, etc. But then the bottleneck shifted into the PHP code to parse and analyze the data itself.

The ability to set how long I will be at each point and a summary of weather impact at such a location.

Knowing what to expect within a set range of times is much more useful and practical than knowing when the best weather conditions MAY be to support pleasure or optional travel. I do 90% more business travel on demand than I do pleasure.<p>Example: departing Richmond, CA to San Francisco International Airport.

Office hours of 9-4 (ie no incentive to provide a better service) are typical, the system clogged up with people who either don't need to see a doctor or, in the case with many old age pensioners, they simply go to the doctor for someone to talk to.<p>2.

Governments may pay per college student but those funds aren't distributed equally. When I went almost nothing was spent on first-year students. Most of that money was diverted to research activities, which brings into question the quality of education the government was paying for;<p>5. If you accept the premise that paid college leads to higher earning potential, countries that have free higher education will lose people to those countries where you pay as the labour mobility is high and only getting higher. I believe this at least in part explains the brain drain from Eastern Europe to the US in the 90s; and<p>6. Demand will be increased by other countries. In Germany, for example, you have a lot of Brazilians who go there for free university, typically going there for 6-12 months prior to learn German.<p>One of the reasons that college costs so much is probably the same reason health care (in the US) costs so much: it's a protected market of sorts. In the US, IP laws mean drugs in Canada and elsewhere cost a fraction of what they do in the US (and most of the cost basis for drugs in the US goes on marketing not research).<p>If you want to be a doctor (of cours) you need to go to college. But what about a computer programmer? Many of the best companies will require a college degree. A computer science education is obviously useful but not a prerequisite to learning to program. Most programmers I know learnt to program before or outside college.<p>So what you have a captive market.<p>It would be reasonable to assume that competition between colleges would sort this out but that doesn't seem to be the case. Sure there is competition for students and teaching/research talent but that's not the same thing. For example, a friend of mine believes (rightly or wrongly) she'll probably never get a great teaching job because her PhD (in history) isn't from a top school like Harvard or Princeton (IIRC).<p>So you can choose to make a purely economic decision and go to a cheaper school but the cheaper and more expensive schools aren't necessarily equivalent, either in fact or in perception (which can be far more important).<p>I suspect this won't change until something disrupts the higher education system itself.",1298135093

However I found out that bashmarks doesn't work with folders which have whitespaces in the name.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  cd /Users/username/Library/Application\ Support
  s app_support
</code></pre>
works great but if you do this it won't work:<p><pre><code>  g app_support
</code></pre>
I opened an issue on GitHub and after that I tried to fix it on my own. I never wrote a bash script and I'm really proud to have fixed this problem on my own.<p>Here are changes I made:<p><pre><code>  # save current directory to bookmarks
  touch ~/.sdirs
  function s {
     cat ~/.sdirs | grep -v ""export DIR_$1="" > ~/.sdirs1
     mv ~/.sdirs1 ~/.sdirs

     escaped_path=${PWD/ /\\ }
     echo ""export DIR_$1=$escaped_path"" >> ~/.sdirs
  }

  # jump to bookmark
  function g {
     source ~/.sdirs
     path=$(eval $(echo echo $(echo \$DIR_$1)))
  
     # replace whitespaces with ""\ "" for escaping
     escaped_path=${path/ /\\ }
     cd_eval=""cd $escaped_path""
    
     eval $cd_eval
  }
</code></pre>
Hope this helps you guys like it helped me.
And if there is a way to do this in an more elegant way, please let me know. This would help me to improve my none existing bash skills :D<p>Edit: I opened up a fork and commited all my changes to this repo. I also opened a pull request and I hope my fix will get accepted.<p>GitHub fork:

It is angels who make Saturn, Jupiter, the sun, etc., turn round. If the earth revolves, it must also have an angel in the centre to set it in motion; but only devils live there; it would therefore be a devil who would impart motion to the earth....<p>> The planets, the sun, the fixed stars, all belong to one species - namely, that of stars.

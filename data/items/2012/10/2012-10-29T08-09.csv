4711533,comment,4710535,4710599,8,0,lloeki,,,"Completely different achievement here. Backstory: I was fit as a student: I could climb a 15m rope up with hands only, was completing 5c/6a climbs (French grade), was regularly skating around town and on a karting track, mountain biking my bike up 1000m and freeriding back down...<p>Then I got a stable relationship, a job, and a car. Before I knew it I grew lazy, fat, weak, and increasingly sad and spiteful. It took me a few years to actually get I was slipping down a dangerous slope and a little more to find I was the only one to blame.<p>It's been four years and I lost 15kg, slowly, regularly. I can ride again to work without turning into a pouch of water, turned from unable to run 1km without panting to death to running 10km not effortlessly but ""easily"" nonetheless. Food also improved a lot, both in volume and quality. Net result is I feel healthy again, both in my body and in my mind.<p>Here's the solution I came up with:<p>- step 1: make it a habit<p>- step 2: make it a habit (for real)<p>- step 3: wait<p>The first thing is actually getting that <i>I do have the time</i> to take care of myself, if only I want to take it. I bounded that time, just to be psychologically sure of it and not skip. First goal was running 2km without panting. Then running 3km under 20min. At some point of course I could run much longer but it would take more time (not that it was really a problem to do it, but it could become an excuse, the easy way out). So I made running the latter <i>trivial</i>, so that I'd have even less of a reason to skip. Alternatively, if I could not run for some reason I'd do some exercise (abs, push-ups, dips) instead for the same amount of time. Again, the goal was to minimize friction, exercises I could practice anywhere, anytime (e.g for dips I use two chairs), without failing the habit, and not thinking about it. The same basically goes for food, where I traded a high fat, high carb, processed food diet for something much much more balanced.<p>Also, trigger the high. At some point when running (or whatever) you just feel good because of the adrenaline rush (I may use music to help that, and running outside and focusing on your lesser used senses, especially touch, helps a lot). This is important as it triggers the reward system and helps making it a habit <i>for real</i> (and on step 1 it's really easy to delude yourself into thinking you have made it a habit when you really did not). Yes I'm voluntarily hacking my body to make it dependent on something, for my own good. And now when I skip doing sports or eating properly, I miss it, physically, in a very short time (short enough that the habit never breaks), not enough to feel bad but just enough to carry on. And the next day or the following one, I'm back in my habit.<p>I still got some work to do to regain original fit but I'm on my way there (extrapolations tell me next year), and now that I'm skateboarding, some even farther day from now I'll land a casper-to-casper (Rodney Mullen is a skateboard hacker[0]) and why not, run a marathon. Everything is possible, it just doesn't happen overnight.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU7s-opqViM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU7s-opqViM</a>",1351500933

4711530,comment,4711346,4711346,5,0,dexen,,,"Whether memset(), or any other function, gets optimized away by GCC should depend on function attributes (1) -- more exactly on the `pure'; possibly some others. However, GCC (tested with 4.7.1) somehow considers memset() pure regardles of declaration. The default declaration is:<p><pre><code>  $ echo '#include <string.h>' | gcc -E - | grep memset
  extern void *memset (void *__s, int __c, size_t __n) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)) __attribute__ ((__nonnull__ (1)));

    extern void *memset (void *__s, int __c, size_t __n);

Contrast that to behavior of any user-defined function:<p><pre><code>    	/* may be optimized away */
    extern void * memxxx(void *__s, int __c, size_t __n) __attribute__ ((pure));

Simply <i>cannot</i> be implemented in a nice-looking way in vim.<p>- Making some fonts smaller or bigger, to display extra information that isn't code. Simply impossible to do, because vim is a one-size font. This alone is a huge limitation.<p>- Making a decent-looking code-folding system. The code folding in vim doesn't look good, and since you're limited to one font size and to only putting in characters, you're stuck with the very ugly way of doing things.

Here [1] is a recent paper, with the most detailed validation of the MS Kinect I have seen so far. They report a  maximum error for reaching movements with OpenNI of <i>46.9 deg</i> in the elbow angle estimation.
Another problem is lag. From what I hear, the main problem here is the USB 2.0 bandwidth. Hopefully the next generation, Kinect 2 and co., will improve a lot.<p>[1] S Choppin, J Wheat , 2012, Marker-less tracking of human movement using Microsoft Kinect

Secondary sources may have pictures, quotes or graphics of primary sources in them.<p>> The function of these is to interpret primary sources, and so can be described as at least one step removed from the event or phenomenon under review. Secondary source materials, then, interpret, assign value to, conjecture upon, and draw conclusions about the events reported in primary sources.<p>(At this point I also feel it important to point out that both of these sources believe that encyclopedias are ""secondary sources"". If you do a search on Google for ""tertiary source"", which Wikipedia adamantly believes is a third category that includes encyclopedias, you get only 43k hits, half of which mention ""wikipedia"". The few universities that mention ""tertiary source"" list encyclopedias as being in both categories: only Wikipedia seems to believe that encyclopedias are clearly and definitively a ""tertiary source"".)<p>If you are interested in opinions and analysis, you can happily refer to a secondary source, but if you want to verify what actually happened, you cannot be taken seriously unless you can show a clear trail of evidence that terminates in a primary source.<p>(Certainly, if it is impossible to obtain primary sources, then one can use a secondary source, but that is something that should only be used as a last resort: if you have access to the primary sources that a secondary source used, you should verify them yourself.)<p>The result of attempting to find truth from secondary sources is that you will forever be plagued by horrible bias, both in terms of what things you can find to be ""notable"" and in terms of the validity of the opinions you can find in them.<p>Worse, as encyclopedias--which today pretty much means ""Wikipedia"" to a very large percentage of the public--are used as reference material for the construction of secondary sources, everything from newspaper articles to books, claiming secondary sources to have anything to do with ""validation"" just makes your chain of evidence circular.<p>And, in fact, there have been multiple published large-scale examples of such circular information ending up in Wikipedia, as temporarily un-sourced information gets used in newspaper articles which then reinforces the information in Wikipedia when editors attempt to find sources.<p>Regardless, the entire notion is kind of preposterous anyway, as the way that most secondary sources operate they just print what they are told by the people they interview for articles <i>without the citations required to verify the ultimate source of the information</i>.<p>This means that if someone, whether it be the Roth example from a few days ago or anyone else wanting to provide a paper-trail for information on Wikipedia, wants to be able to get something into Wikipedia, they really just need to be in the position to tell a reporter the information: they do not need to post it themselves directly.<p>As an interesting contextual example of this, Wikipedia now actually does have an article on Diggnation. In this article, it states quite firmly that ""there are an estimated 250,000 regular subscribers to the show"" along with a sourced citation to... the New York Times.<p>However, the article in the New York Times quite clearly was entirely itself sourced by simply asking the people who worked for Diggnation and Revision3 a bunch of questions; it even quite clearly states that that number came from them: ""Revision3 says it counts roughly 250,000 views each week"".<p>In such a situation, the way the New York Times operates (and I know this first hand, as there have been articles about the things that I do published by them) is that they will happily publish whatever number you tell them, and at best ""fact check"" it by calling you back to verify they heard you correctly.<p>This does not make the number true; it barely even demonstrates ""Diggnation was important enough to have an article written about them"", due to the ""slows news day"" phenomenon. The idea that this source is somehow different from any other source is just a fantasy, and one that, as far as I've been able to tell, one that only Wikipedia believes.<p>Wikipedia, in fact, seems to take the exact opposite stance on all of this, claiming that ""Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources"", along with a long list of rules about how primary sources (which are apparently even more dangerous in their world-view than <i>tertiary sources</i>) can technically be used, but only in highly limited and nearly useless circumstances.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research</a><p>The result of this insanity is then numerous situations like the one that treelovinhippie ran into.

If you use the controls on your scope to zoom in on the bottom trace by increasing the vertical sensitivity you'll get a much better idea of what I'm getting at here. You'll see '0' voltage and yet current is still flowing.<p>You can't correct for power factor by simply increasing the resolution and averaging. The base frequency of your oscilloscope does not enter into the discussion here, it could be 500 Hz for all I care and that would be enough.<p>Furthermore, the power factor of a switched mode supply changes as a function of the load applied and gets (much) worse if that load is also reactive or capacitive. Under some circumstances it is possible to draw <i>negative</i> power from the wall socket if you do a naive measurement, or you'll see wall socket power decrease as output current increases.<p>All this is possible because voltage and current are more or less out of phase with each other.<p>The kill-a-watt will work well with some reactive loads (such as CFLs) as long as they're of the ballast type.<p>A switched mode supply presents challenges that can't be met at the cost constraints of a consumer device like that.<p>Vampire power is a new term, I'm not familiar with it. Dead load (or simply the losses) is anything that does not end up in your consumer (the live load), I'm not sure if that is an accurate translation of the terms. It normally goes up as a function of the amount of power consumed, the base line (consumption without any load at all) is probably your 'vampire power'.<p>Total efficiency is 100 * ((output power)/(input power)) and will in practice be anywhere from 60% to 98% depending on how well load and supply are matched, and can vary wildly from one powersupply to another due to component variations.<p>Finally, classical power factor correction applies to sinusoidal wave forms, as you've already discovered switched mode supplies waveforms on both the input and the output side are anything but sinusoidal further complicating an already hairy problem.",1351499217

268314,comment,267740,267740,0,0,netcan,,,"According to Carl Sagan, the experiment will not produce much. I don't think they actually expect to produce micro black holes.\nThe most 'interesting' probable result is actually a negative outcome. IE they fail to detect the Higgs boson. That would mean that the 'standard model' needs to be abandoned.",1218009307

However, Wirth's description of it is more intuitive for me as a coder than Kleene closure (""smallest superset of X, including \lamba, closed under concatenation"").<p><i>conclusion</i>: a compiler book, like the Dragon book, but less academic (that's a good thing) and with Pascal examples.",1218008399

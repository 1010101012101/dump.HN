Sim City 4 <i>did</i> have congestion problems and it did simulate Sims going from point A to B. It wasn't as granular as SC5 simulating individual cars, but it did simulate groups of Sims traveling to and from work. It was also infamously buggy (something the modding community spent a lot of effort fixing) but it still was better than what we have now.",1363193947

Flash is still warm in its grave, and people are already blaming it for crimes that HTML5 hasn't even really made yet. Don't get me wrong, when the function of a website is to perform a task or convert users into paying customers then by all means streamline the crap out of it. The sites that do that well will succeed, the ones that create an unusable mess will fail, simples. But don't go around pointing fingers at everyone trying to make something innovate or different. Make no mistake, a lot of the well accepted web2.0/native app tactile/animated interface elements we take for granted now were birthed during the frenzied experimentation of the mid 2000s Flash era. I for one am occasionally delighted to visit a site with an off the wall animated interface, tiny fonts and crazy navigation. It's food for thought, sometimes inspiration. Yeah, maybe they got it horrible wrong, but its creative.<p>And besides, this guy is really scraping the bottom of the barrel here. 404 a ""HTML5"" problem? Auto-playing vidoes a ""HTML5"" problem?

Here are the previous two sentences for context.<p><i>The bigger problem was dealing with big traffic spikes. When a big spike in traffic came in, it created a domino effect that would take take down our entire cluster</i><p>Given the article to that point, it is clear what is happening.  They are maintaining a steady state of X% (where X is above 50), then a big traffic spike comes along.  That traffic load is not distributed equally (my guess is because requests are not created equal) and there is a hot spot.  The hot spot fails, then increases the load on everything else.  After this repeats a few times, there is insufficient capacity.<p>In other words at some steady state threshold above 50%, you wind up without sufficient capacity to handle traffic spikes.  Nothing in this failure scenario is specific to Rails.  It is a well-known failure mode for a cluster under load with a push based architecture (which http requests are).<p>The fact that you did not understand that description speaks poorly of your problem solving skills.  Now they may well have been doing something trivial that is fixable to cause load to be less than it was.

5369499,comment,5359406,5369140,1,0,betterunix,,,"""The thing you must realize is that those previous systems didn't solve the problem Bitcoin solves""<p>That is not the point.  Previous work in the field of digital cash and in multiparty computation is very much relevant to Bitcoin, even if Bitcoin addresses a modified problem.  The failure to even mention that such work has been done, coupled with a woefully deficient analysis, indicates that the author of the Bitcoin paper had not done much background research.<p>What stands out the most is the security analysis for Bitcoin.  First, the author makes the claim that the system is secure as long as the attacker controls less than half the sum of the computing power of all nodes in the system.  This is not really a well-understood model of security; cryptography researchers usually speak of either ""honest but curious"" models i.e. everyone follows the protocol faithfully or ""malicious"" models i.e. some parties may deviate from the protocol in arbitrary ways.  The idea of a party that can deviate, but only as long as their work is less than the sum of the work done by all other parties, is strange -- but this new security model is not discussed in any depth, nor is it even mentioned as being a new model of security.  No time is spent actually proving the claim, which is unsurprising given that the security model itself is not even formalized.<p>Worse still, the security analysis that is presented only deals with a specific attack carried out in a specific way.  The author proves in a somewhat-formal way that this particular attack cannot be carried out in the way he envisioned.  No evidence is given that another method of carrying out the attack is impossible, nor is any evidence given that other attacks are impossible.<p>There is an old proverb in cryptography:  anyone can come up with a cryptosystem they themselves cannot break.  That is what you are seeing with Bitcoin, but even worse, because the developers know how to break it but do not believe that anyone would be willing to put in the effort.  The German cryptographers were surprised to discover that the Allies were willing to build the code-breaking machine necessary to crack Enigma; they knew it had weaknesses but believed that the cost of exploiting those weaknesses was too high for anyone to justify.<p>My point is less about what problem Bitcoin solves, and more about whether or not Bitcoin's developers are aware of just how much work has been done on secure multiparty computation or digital cash systems.",1363192827

Everything is fake.<p>With SimCity 5 you can easily have over 100.000 Sims in one city region. SimCity has to model the economy, happiness, education, water, waste, power, pollution, traffic, industry, and much more. So if you want to do this for 100.000 Sims in real-time you've got to cut many corners. There's just no other way. And the illusion in SimCity 5 is pretty damn good, from what I've seen.

I have no idea how they let this one out the door with the pathfinding problem, which in my book is an absolute showstopper.<p>Clever, dedicated, and somewhat masochistic players have found ways to ""hack"" the poor pathfinding behavior. The most popular format right now is to build a city <i>with no intersections</i>, since the AI deals so spectacularly poorly with them. Which is to say, the entire city is a single, long, winding road. This <i>forces</i> your dumb sims to have no choice but the right one.<p>Some apologists have claimed this is simply the rules of the game, but I still maintain that SimCity fails unless it maintains <i>some</i> semblance to real-life cities. If the only way to play the game effectively is to build something that bears <i>zero</i> semblance to any real city, then it has failed.<p>The funny part is that this loosely resembles the recent Heroku fiasco. In the game your civic services (police, fire, ambulances, garbage) are supposed to intelligently service the city - in reality their pathfinding results in basically random behavior, vastly increasing the amount of capacity you need to build to statistically serve an area. You have to <i>grossly</i> over-build your fire and police departments because their pathfinding is awful and random.<p>I'm not usually this hard on others' hard work - but this game is a travesty that should never have shipped in this state, even disregarding the server issues.

What if Warner Bros. pulls the plug after 1m dollars is spent on script rewrites?

5369273,comment,5368475,5368475,7,0,lakey,,,"Author here. Thanks for all of your comments.<p>To clarify:<p>1. The article clearly isn't an attack on HTML5 itself, but of designers who happen to be building HTML5 sites with a lack of concern for the user experience. The gap between design and UX has hugely narrowed in the past decade, and I don't want to see it open up again. It is a plea of sorts, and I apologise if I've mislabelled the headline.<p>2. The article is a response to the many posts I see that hold up these sites as being ""inspirational examples of HTML5 design"". I'm afraid that I don't think many of these sites are inspiring, given the UX issues. And yes, they could have been built in HTML4, but they're using HTML5 / CSS3. Hence the headline, though no doubt I could have chosen a clearer one.<p>3. Yes, our site has all manner of issues, though I've yet to see it in a compendium of 'inspirational' sites. The roll-up is there because sometimes business goals sometimes kick UX goals in the face. The roll-up should not appear immediately and should not obscure all of the screen (please suggest a more elegant solution).<p>4. 404 pages. A lame point. My bad.<p><returns to bunker>",1363190515

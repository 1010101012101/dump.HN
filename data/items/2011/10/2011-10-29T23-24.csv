3173195,comment,3170766,3170766,1,0,jbwyme,,,"I feel like this article takes a very pessimistic view. To be great or have success in any field, doing anything, you are going to be up against ""bad odds"". If the odds of success were in everyone's favor then it wouldn't be ""success"" anymore. If anything this is a very discouraging article for people who may be aspiring to accomplish something great which I feel like the HN community is all about.<p>Perhaps I've misunderstood the authors intentions?  The parts about young people in start-ups, and how it becomes a downward spiral if you aren't in the lucky 10% is such a negative view it hurts. Specifically the ""odds"" of succeeding and the relative unimportance of the connections you make during that time because [paraphrased] ""most of the connections you make in the start-up world are with other start-ups who are likely to fail as well"". This is just such a losing mindset to have. If the only thing you are concerned about is not failing then you have no chance to do anything of importance. The choice is yours.<p>I apologize if I've missed the point here as I know there were a lot of other parts in the article about adding value to your career and understanding how corporate structures work. I do believe those are great things to understand but the tone of the whole thing really struck a nerve.",1319932740

3173191,comment,3173016,3173016,4,0,tryitnow,,,"I think Silicon Valley is the answer, not the problem.<p>There's a world of difference between the massively publicly subsidized, mostly zero sum financial industry and the technology driven entrepreneurship of the Valley. One hedge fund's gains are another hedge fund's losses.*  Google and Facebook make money by improving the matching between buyers and sellers.  I would argue that thus far, my trade of privacy for useful communication tools has worked wondrously in my favor.  Does anyone disagree with that?<p>Privacy?  I absolutely agree that's an issue.  If you do too, then do something about it.  Create a company that consumers can flee too when/if Facebook et al. overstep their bounds.  That's competition.  It actually exists in the Valley.  After the tech bubble did Uncle Sam bail out the entrepreneurs and VCs?  No.<p>Yet when Wall Street managed to destroy more wealth than they ever created, the taxpayer had to basically insure them against losses (it doesn't matter if the government was made whole afterwards - the value of the insurance itself is an implicit subsidy as well as a moral hazard).<p>Of course, government subsidies, particularly military subsidies, were crucial to the early development of the Valley, but can anyone argue that we haven't earned rich dividends on those public dollars?<p>Tech entrepreneurship is much more likely to be a positive sum game than the financial speculation that has enriched the Street and the City.<p>Many of the biggest problems we face as a society can only be solved by technology entrepreneurship.  Information technology is ushering in an era of personalized medicine that holds the promise of finally offering us effective care at reasonable cost.  New models of web-based and social learning promise to disrupt the academic status quo and provide a new outlet for smart people to learn skills quickly and efficiently.  The Valley has also been at the forefront of investing in energy technologies that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.<p>Seriously, what has Wall Street done? What can they do?  Is loaning someone money to buy a house really so hard you need a 100 PhD quants figuring out how to do it?  Probably not.  However, if your goal is to fight a zero sum game in the financial markets with other hedge funds then that brain power comes in handy.  But what has society gained in that scenario?  Nothing.  Instead we've just lost brain power that could have been developing the next disruptive technology.<p>* This is only true in highly liquid markets.  I think the evidence suggests that financial trading is valuable up to a point to create liquidity.  I would argue that the US and UK have well exceeded the point where we need to shuffle more brains and talent into Wall Street and the City.",1319932658

3173178,comment,3171665,3173099,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"The idea of a golden age when litigation was rare and fair dealing was the order of the day is a myth, as far as I can tell. My torts casebook quotes cases going back to the 14th century, and perjury and frameups were enough of a problem in ancient Babylon to be subject to legal proscription. People have always tried to get off the hook for their liabilities. It's not a new phenomenon. People are not going to change; this is why neither libertarianism nor communism scales well.<p>What you call <i>restitution</i> is known in law as <i>economic damages</i>. When you mention throwing the book at people who try to evade their responsibilities, that's called <i>punitive damages</i>. The tort reform movement is always saying that damages are abusive and that people should be protected from punitive damages, and tend to be opposed to excessive regulation as well. The plaintiff bar argues that without the threat of unlimited liability injured parties will have no legal remedy.<p>Consider the alternative, where your neighbor turns out to be an obnoxious ass and brings suit against you without a good reason. It happens, and if your neighbor is wealthy or just very persistent then fighting off his suit will be an expensive inconvenience at best. By obtaining and complying with a permit, you are insulated from his abusive litigation.<p>This does not happen <i>so</i> often with homeowners, but such conflicts between businesses are not at all uncommon - think patent litigation. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturges_v_Bridgman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturges_v_Bridgman</a> is a famous example; in a nutshell, your private rights are subordinate to society's overall interest, since the latter is nothing more than the aggregated interests of other private individuals.

You want to find between the beginning and end of a list called v, for a value between y < i < x. Admittedly the condition in the lambda could be better written, and the results should probably be called something other than i, but it's perfectly clear what's going on here.<p>Let's look at the equivalent C++98 loop:<p><pre><code>   int i = -1;

It's impossible to have a productive discussion if you're using overly broad terminology, or defining words differently.  Then, you turn it into a binary debate by labeling those who disagree with your particular brand of ""security"" as ""anti-security.""  Start by defining, in terms of the intended result and means to get there, exactly what you mean by ""security,"" and don't lump all kinds of ""security"" together under one label.<p><i>Trolling:</i> since this type of conversation almost invariably produces back and forth arguments between people thinking, ""If only they read my own unique perspective, maybe they'll finally understand.""

You know that most of HN is vocally opposed to the kind of child-groping security theater the TSA is practicing, so you might be better received if you tried to explain your security goals in ways that appeal to that audience.  For example, give us solid metrics that were decided upon before a new security measure was enacted, demonstrably correlate to actual crime, improve after the measure is implemented, and don't cause undue burden on freedom or the economy (where by ""undue"" I mean cost more in time, money, or liberty than the time, money, or liberty gained by implementing the measure).",1319932024

Say that if you're at the 99% percentile of Language X developers, there are (say) about 1,000 people like you in the world. If you're in the 99.99% percentlie, there are now only 10 people like you worldwide. Wouldn't that result in a much bigger price that you could put on your services?""</i><p>This sounds good in theory, however, there are only so many businesses that actually are in need of 'a programmer in the 99th percentile of language X'. You can find a lot more that are looking for 'a programmer that helps me make more money'.<p>The problem is that there's a big gap between 'being sufficient in language X' and being in the 99th percentile. If you are in the 90th percentile of language X developers, there's not much people looking for you (they need the 99th percentile guy).<p><i>""For example, let's say that you're a CEO, and you have hired an expensive programmer to write a script that periodically checks that your backups are valid. That would qualify for a ""Cost Center"", right? And everyone would agree that this is a wise investment.<p>So what am I supposed to do if I'm hired to do this kind of job? Decline it because it's a Cost Cetner?""</i>
As far as I understood the article, the point would be to look how you could communicate about the job so it would be attached to the Profit Center. Let me give it a (probably bad) try: _""I make sure company X saves 10K on manual backup verifications, which are in place to make sure they don't lose millions when a backup is required.""_<p>A normal CEO would probably only hire you for $AMOUNT_OF_MONEY if he believes it would save him >$AMOUNT_OF_MONEY on e.g. manual labor.<p><i>""You also suggest to ""engineer your transfer [from Cost Center to Profit Center] after joining the company"". Wouldn't that be kinda douche-y? I mean, I'd be pretty pissed if I hired a guy to do Job X and then he was trying to engineer his way into Job Y because that's where the money is.""</i>
The trick in 'transferring' to the Profit Center is part communication about your job (to your manager, CEO, clients, etc.) and the other part asking the question _""How does what I'm doing right now makes my boss money?""_ because if it doesn't make him money some how, you're probably messing around.<p>That said, it's really hard to connect 'bugfixes on other people's applications' to the Profit Center.",1319931786

In fact, I was in the same position a few years ago.  Since then, Ive tried everything - books, college classes, videos and more.  For me, and for hundreds of people weve talked to, none of these traditional approaches, though useful for learning history or literature, helped it click for us in learning to program.  My cofounder, Ryan, has spent the past couple of years helping developers at Columbia learn how to apply their theoretical computer science skills to actually programming.  Hes taught hundreds of Columbia students the basics (and beyond).<p>Before I start, I just want to point out that Codecademy is new.  We started working on the project in the middle of August and released it a few weeks later.  The money we raised is not just a show of support for what we have - its a sign that people are excited about the future.<p>Ive been very upfront with everyone weve spoken to so far about what you can learn on Codecademy.  At the moment, the Getting Started with Programming course is indeed very basic.  Its meant to show people that programming can be fun.  As you said, you wont come out of one course as an awesome developer (as I can sadly attest).  Then again, you wont come out of a freshman computer science course with the ability to be an awesome developer.  Its a long road, and thats why developers are a hot commodity nowadays.<p>We only have three courses up right now.  Were working on hundreds more in other languages and at various skill levels.  While you cant learn the full stack from Codecademy now, you will be able to shortly.<p>Lastly, our experience has been that the badges and other aspects are a crucial part of the experience were creating on Codecademy for most of our users.  If you ask most people what stopped them from reading their entire programming book (and weve talked to hundreds of people), its almost always that they arent motivated enough.  In school, learning is motivated by report cards and teacher expectations.  We hope we can build a motivational experience that pushes anyone to program - not just the stereotypical developer.  Weve made a conscious effort to reach out to underrepresented demographics who are interested in learning to program.  Youll see the fruits of those efforts in coming months.<p>Above all, were open to feedback as we grow.  I just hope youll look at what were doing as a first attempt - not the final one.

So, if a method on an object returns a collection, and the caller wants to keep the result around, the programmer will have to somehow know whether the collection that the method returned was freshly allocated or internal to the object, whether it is modifiable, how long the content of the collection is guaranteed to be stay constant (e.g: what happens when I append to a list from a loop that iterates over it?), etc.<p>Similarly, if one passes an object to say a constructor, one should know whether the constructed object holds a reference to that object, thus sort-of claiming ownership.<p>It is true, though, that whenever I think about such issues, I am amazed that these things so rarely lead to problems.

All this technology wont be invented to make our lives better, it'll be invented to make money.<p>I think the iPhone would be the best current day example of it.

3173082,comment,3172943,3172943,1,0,aherlambang,,,"I think if you want to join a startup, the best time would be really straight after college. At that point in time you usually will find individuals who are motivated, fresh, and very well driven, which are very important in startups. Big company names in resumes are never bad, but there are many other ways to compensate that in life (side-projects, brilliant hacks, contribution to open source projects). I guess it's just a matter of choice/preference, but it's never wrong to go one over the other. If you want to have a safe/no risk life, go with the large companies.. if you want to take some risk, add more flavors to your life, startup is the way to go. No one is born the same way, so either way is perfectly acceptable. I just feel like the author emphasizes that if you join a startup straight after you graduate then you're doomed for the rest of your life, which absolutely is not true.",1319929515

But there is no doubt that the tax hikes will be substantial.<p>I believe we're in a pretty poisonous political environment, where the dominant strategy for a politician seems to be to convince your constituents that they're being taken advantage of. Most people who benefit from government programs don't realize it (see <a href=""http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/keep-your-government-hands-off-my-government-programs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/keep-your-gover...</a>), and most voters have an incredibly skewed view of what, exactly, the government spends money on. When polled, voters oppose cuts to almost every major program.<p>That the median voter has largely incoherent views on the budget, but is very angry about it, leads us right into our current mess.<p>To my original point: OP's argument is big on righteous indignation, along with a narrative that allows him to cast himself as a ""good guy"" and short on actual facts to how to dig our way out of this mess.",1319929208

I took a look at some of your examples:<p>""Yesterday, a friendly game between men's national basketball teams from China and Brazil turned into a melee when Zhang Qingpeng was fouled hard by a Brazilian player less than a minute into the game.""<p>""You can see the tiny Aussie guy in red swipe at the ball not once, but twice at 0:36-0:37. The ball is being held up high by the Chinese player (rightfully so), and the short Aussie looks like he's swiping (or could be throwing punches - hard to tell) high near the Chinese player's face, which is not going to be taken so kindly by the Chinese rebounder.<p>At that point, the Chinese rebounder is intimidating the short Aussie, then the Aussie teammates runs in (from the bottom right of the screen) and push the Chinese rebounder. That's when the Chinese bench clears and the brawl breaks loose.""<p>I really don't see how you come to any conclusion that fighting = racial frustration. A cuban tae kwon do competitor lost his temper, kicked a ref and got banned from the Olympics. Ron Artest jumped into the stands. Team Canada once had a bench brawl with the Soviets in hockey.<p>Race really has nothing to do with anything in these instances.",1319929202

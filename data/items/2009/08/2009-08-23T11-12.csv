I can picture some possibilities in gallery/image applications (triple click to tag? iphone-zoom? ...)",1251028201
780457,comment,780412,780412,0,0,jules,,,"Think about how this is compiled. In machine language there are no nested expressions, so the compiler will have to split the expression up.<p><pre><code>    expression( ... ++x ... )
</code></pre>
will probably be translated to<p><pre><code>    x = x+1;
    expression( ... x ... )
</code></pre>
This is the simplest way to compile ++x:<p><pre><code>    1. put x=x+1 before the expression
    2. replace ++x with x
</code></pre>
So I think most languages would get 22.<p>But in languages where + is a function there's a good chance you get 21.",1251028114

There is however always a risk that in doing so you alienate the very audience you initially set-up to serve. But if as a business you are comfortable with that then that's ok.<p>I do feel however that because of its undeniable success on Twitter, Mashable tends to show a little bit of bias in favour of Twitter and sometimes against Twitter's biggest rival Facebook - just my opinion.",1251028090

That your porn loving, upskirt looking, money loving, not so pretty self is destined to do more then spank the monkey, visit strip clubs, watch tv, and play video games is a suprise to most people.  They don't know that they can change the world yet be broken themselves at the same time.  Many people feel they must be perfect first (which is impossible) before they can go out do whatever they are drawn to (in the positive).",1251027621

If a functional penal system actually helps to curb society's fundamental problems rather than simply concentrating the undesirables, there's a feedback loop that affects the number of people incarcerated.

780444,comment,779531,780094,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""Acting badly towards an unpopular group is seldom frowned upon.""</i><p>Your argument is disingenuous. Some groups are unpopular for good reason - because they do bad things, or make society worse for everyone else. When these groups are treated in a negative manner by society, it is proper and healthy, as it helps to discourage the groups spreading.<p>If you were to hear someone at a party loudly proclaiming the inherent criminal nature of blacks, would you afford him the normal respect upon encountering him later? Would you be terribly upset if you later heard that his web page had been hacked? I think not. He's not from just another group, one which happens to be randomly unpopular. He's from an inferior, dangerous, poisonous group and the more society can do to make such groups feel uncomfortable continuing in their ways, the better.<p>Christians, I'm afraid, are one of these groups. Even today, in 2009, they are continuing in their insane anti-science, anti-education campaign to throw the world back to the dark ages. Attempting to delegitimise evolution. Denying the fossil record and the age of the world, and by proxy all of geology, astronomy, and many other sciences. Campaigning against equal rights for gays. Opposing important medical research. Trying to weaken the boundary between (their) church and state. Encroaching on free expression. The list goes on and on.<p>It benefits society for damaging groups such as this to be reduced and one day eliminated. One of the tools we have to do this is that of humour/humiliation - to turn the group into a laughing stock. 4chan are simply the volunteer actors in this instance. You might not approve of their specific methods, but it's a job which needs to be done one way or the other and anything is better than nothing.<p><i>""Two millenia later, Christians are the new Christians.""</i><p>Two millenia later, it's a disgrace upon humanity that there's still even such a thing as Christians. But yep - still whining.",1251025971

Your analogy speaks of killing <i>all the self-confessed communists you can find</i>.<p>The attacks on Christian facebook accounts were a drop in the bucket, they were a few of the self-confessed Christians who happened to use the same name and password on Facebook that they did on a dating site, hardly all anyone could find.<p>The whole thing reminds me of skinhead teen-agers getting drunk and anonymously vandalizing homes with spray-paint at night.

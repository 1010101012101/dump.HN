During that period, despite the people receiving the advice wanting to lose weight, the population has become massively obese. Makes me wonder why you&#x27;re so cock-sure of yourself.<p>Anyway, Taubes deals very effectively with the argument you&#x27;re presenting. The gist is that the number of kilo joules consumed does not have a particularly good correlation with fat stored, because the fat storage mechanism is mediated by insulin, which is heavily influenced by the consumption of carbohydrates.",1408744712

It&#x27;s certainly easier to say &quot;avoid food types A and B&quot;, rather than &quot;take all the foods you eat, get the calories per gram, weigh them up, then count how much you&#x27;re eating, make sure you stay below this limit, and just ignore that nagging feeling in you&#x27;re brain that tells you you&#x27;re hungry, you could avoid that feeling easily by eating right, but that&#x27;s too complicated for you, just eat whatever and write down these numbers instead.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know for sure what works, but arguing by &quot;what&#x27;s more simple&quot; is stupidity.<p>&quot;How much easier than &quot;eat less calories than you use&quot; can it be?&quot;<p>Sending a rocket to space is easy.

8214146,comment,8211747,8213808,1,0,hownottowrite,,,"That&#x27;s unfortunate because I didn&#x27;t make any diagnosis at all.  I was reacting to the following in the article (as referenced by the comment to which I originally replied):<p>[I pick out one of the posts promoted to Secret’s homepage, and read it to Byttow over the phone: “At work I’m being given more and more responsibility. Silently I’m struggling with mental illness.” Does Secret provide enough anonymity for that user?<p>He turns the question back on me. If there was no Secret, or an app like it, where would this anonymous poster go for catharsis? Where would he share his struggle with mental illness? Facebook? Don’t make him laugh.]<p>Clearly, the interviewer and CEO David Byttow are talking about mental illness.  They are not talking about someone having a bad day or even suffering from mild, common depression.  They are talking about mental illness, and I am reacting to their discussion of mental illness.  My original point, short as it was, is that someone with an actual mental illness ought to seek actual treatment rather than the faceless world of something akin to Secret.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that talking on Secret (our a diary for that matter) is a terrible thing.  However, the assertion by Byttow is that his service provides a legitimate outlet for someone who may need real help and may pose a danger to themselves or others.<p>Perhaps the meaning of &quot;mental illness&quot; is where we differ in the discussion?  How about I reveal a &quot;secret&quot; which is quite true and we see where this goes...<p>I do not know you, nor do you know me.  I do not know if you or people you know suffer from mental illness.  You do not know if I or people I know suffer from mental illness.  I do not know if you or people you know have injured themselves or others as a result of their illness.  You do not know if I or others I know have done likewise.  However, I will reveal to you, that I have indeed known more than one person who suffered from serious mental illness.  Some of these people have injured themselves and others as a result of this situation.  Of this group, some received professional help.  Most did not.  Those who did not chose instead to keep it to themselves or to talk to unqualified people who had lots of supporting words but had absolutely no idea what they were actually dealing with.<p>The results?  In two cases, suicide.  In one case, murder.  Another particular person has conducted a lifelong campaign of mental and physical abuse against family members resulting in another person&#x27;s suicide.  In these four cases, could the issue have been resolved with proper assistance?  I think so, at least in three of the cases.  Would something like Secret help?  Unlikely.  These individuals needed real help.<p>So, when I say that it is dangerous, it&#x27;s because I have witnessed first hand how dangerous mental illness can be.  It is dangerous for professionals and lay persons alike.  It is dangerous for the individual suffering from the affliction and for those around them.  Is this always the case?  Of course, not.  Perhaps your experience is different.  I certainly hope so because it is a horrible thing to witness a person you know suffer in this manner and then cause injury to themselves or others.  I wouldn&#x27;t wish it on anyone.",1408744668

8214144,comment,8212340,8214098,3,0,enraged_camel,,,">>How much easier than &quot;eat less calories than you use&quot; can it be?<p>Because we have no way to accurately measure how many calories your body actually uses. We only have very, very rough estimates and guidelines, and even then there are so many factors to take into account (some personal, some environmental) that it will simply overwhelm a beginner. For example, when you are at a caloric deficit, your metabolism slows down and therefore burns fewer calories too. Not only that, but your hormone balance changes too, and your body can re-prioritize which tissues to retain and which to get rid of. This is why people who lose weight don&#x27;t lose just fat but also a lot of muscle, and become weaker as a result.<p>This is why an &quot;eat this, not that&quot; approach works a lot better than an &quot;eat less calories than you use&quot; approach. The former is very clear and tangible. The other uses a lot of rough measurements and guesswork and the side effects of its results are not always ideal.",1408744620

His body is demanding increased caloric intake (via insulin, leptin, and ghrelin) to maintain fat stores.</i><p>That &quot;arrow&quot; of causality is more of a messy tangle. Everything (appetite, eating habits, body fat, environment, mental state, exercise/lifestyle habits) affects pretty much everything else.<p>In particular the environment can have a rather strong effect on eating habits.

Athletes and people attempting to take the first steps to losing weight and understanding their bodies are not even remotely the same, and it&#x27;s preposterous they would use the same technique to reach their goals.<p>(Also note, your incorrect interpretation of what I said shows you yourself are not completely understanding what I&#x27;m saying or what you need to do about it. I never once said <i>eat less</i>. In fact, I&#x27;ve seen hundreds of people lose weight by vastly increasing the <i>amount</i> they eat by eating vast mountains of vegetables and some fruit, and eating many, many meals per day.

8214127,comment,8212335,8212793,7,0,scott_s,,,"I&#x27;ve mentioned this a bunch already on HN, but I recommend reading &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; by Thomas Kuhn. The book was published before most people had even heard the phrase &quot;computer science,&quot; but I think that computer science still follows some of the patterns he talks about.<p>In Kuhn&#x27;s view, &quot;normal science&quot; is mostly iterative and incremental. It is so because most people in the discipline agree on most of the big issues, and people are mostly refining those understandings. The periods where people <i>don&#x27;t</i> agree on the big issues in a discipline is around the time of scientific revolutions: the solutions to such big issues are so different from previous approaches that accepting them requires a complete re-think of what the discipline is.<p>A lot of areas of CS are in the &quot;normal science&quot; part of that cycle, and I think compilers and languages are in there. (The biggest argument against that is concurrency and parallelism.) In the 60s and 70s, programming languages were <i>new</i>, and they changed computer science forever. We were exploring what these things could <i>be</i>.<p>I also recommend Cristina Videira Lopes&#x27;s blog post, &quot;The Evolution of CS Papers&quot;: <a href=""http://tagide.com/blog/2014/02/the-evolution-of-cs-papers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tagide.com/blog/2014/02/the-evolution-of-cs-papers/</a>",1408744261

I&#x27;ll figure out a better way to define what a scheme is, but it is essentially a piece of the form that is closely related.

Maybe I&#x27;m not the right audience.<p>I&#x27;d love to find out why I&#x27;ve needed it in my life, though, if you can explain further. Right now, here&#x27;s why I wouldn&#x27;t use it:<p>1) It makes code less readable. It&#x27;s anti-sugar. It&#x27;s not obvious what code using plumb will actually do.<p>This right here from your PHP examples is just insanity:<p>--<p>$f = plumb([&#x27;strlen&#x27; __([] , &quot;foo&quot;)]);\n$f(null) === 3\n$compose = plumb([[[2 , __(1 , 0)]]]);<p>--<p>I have absolutely no idea what that does, and in 10 years of writing backends, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written code that I&#x27;d want to replace with that.<p>There are so many brackets and parentheses, it makes my eyes hurt. What if there were 1 nested bracket in the third line instead of 2? If I were scanning for bugs, I might not catch that quickly.<p>2) It makes code less usable. This is similar to the above, but has more to do with handing code over to someone new. If I were scanning some code and saw:<p>--<p>count = plumb([len , &quot;baz&quot;])\ncount(None) == 3<p>--<p>I&#x27;d say, &quot;What the hell?&quot; And then I&#x27;d have to look up what the plumb() function does I thought I was looking at Python syntax, but I&#x27;m actually looking at Python + plumb syntax, which takes time for me to learn.<p>3) It doesn&#x27;t seem to add functionality. What am I missing here? What task were you previously coding that was so difficult that you decided to create plumb?<p>This reminds me of &quot;PHP functions in [insert other language]&quot; libraries or &quot;OOP for JavaScript&quot; articles. Instead of figuring out how to do what they want in a native way, people coming from another language will try to shoehorn the lexicon they&#x27;re familiar with into a new language. That hurts readability, portability, and performance.<p>Yes, it sometimes makes sense to add a new &quot;syntax&quot; (in the form of sugar) to a widely-used language. jQuery and its competitors are the only successful examples of that I can think of, though.<p>Again, really, really curious about the reasoning behind this.

Yes, maybe there is some amount of optimization you can do with your diet, but the simple fact is that there is a not a single study in the history of science which has been able to demonstrate eating at a caloric deficit and gaining weight. Show me an obese person not eating significantly too much.<p>Taubes would say that an obese person eats too much precisely because he is fat, not the reverse. The arrow of causality has been flipped. His body is demanding increased caloric intake (via insulin, leptin, and ghrelin) to maintain fat stores. Those fat stores can&#x27;t be liberated when insulin levels remain high. If this hypothetical obese person keeps eating carbs and has become insulin resistant, those fat stores aren&#x27;t going anywhere without a fight. A calorie restricted diet will help some, as less food produces less insulin, but it&#x27;s far easier to restrict insulinogenic foods. This allows the fat stores to be utilized, and weight loss is the natural result.<p>It sounds counterintuitive at first, but this theory states that the human body knows how to maintain caloric intake. That&#x27;s what hunger is for. But it can only do this if we allow the endocrine system to function normally.<p>Before dismissing the idea, listen to Taubes&#x27;s talk: <a href=""http://youtu.be/ywRV3GH5io0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/ywRV3GH5io0</a>",1408741777

I don&#x27;t care if you eat raw sugar or fat, as long as you eat slightly less calories than your body is using for a prolonged period of time. (yes, you&#x27;ll likely feel like shit if you eat raw sugar or fat, so I don&#x27;t recommend it). Like you said, the body must obey the laws of thermodynamics.

The mere fact so many books exist on the topic, and so many &quot;new&quot; theories come out each year is proof that it&#x27;s too complicated for beginners.<p>Once you have some good &quot;beginner results&quot; and are losing weight consistently you will and start to move from morbidly obese to just obese down to a somewhat healthy range. THEN you can start making it more complicated, and start focusing on WHAT you&#x27;re eating, not simply how much.<p>It&#x27;s an advanced topic that isn&#x27;t required for the basics.

At least around my area, if you travel less than average (10,000 miles per year seems average; I checked at 3,000 miles), Uber is cheaper.  Mostly because of fixed costs like the car itself, insurance, registration, etc.  If you travel about average, then Uber is ~2x more expensive.  This is with what appears to be reduced UberX fees right now (in my area?).<p>And to be honest, 2x more expensive could certainly be worth it, if your average trips are long enough to allow getting some work or other things done during the ride.<p>P.S.

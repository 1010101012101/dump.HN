With over 640 episodes it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to find something of interest!<p>For those not familiar with the show, the format is simple. A topic is picked for each week and it consists of the host, Melvyn Bragg, and three experts on that topic. The experts are then left to discuss the topic for 45 minutes with the host only interjecting to ask questions and steer the conversation. It&#x27;s very much the pinnacle of listening to smart people talk about things that they&#x27;re interested in.<p>Recent episodes have covered topics as diverse as The Talmud, Photosynthesis, States of Matter, Spartacus and Early Chinese History.<p>A list of episiodes can be found here - <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/player"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/player</a> - and there&#x27;s links on the site to download all the episodes since 2011.",1401359321

Along with this intelligence, in many cases comes some mental difficulties. As an instructor in this environment, it is actually very difficult to deal with some children who are unable to interpret what I am saying to them. Not only does the child get frustrated when I don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re trying to tell me, but I get frustrated sometimes when I can&#x27;t handle the situation, and the other students pick up on my frustration. The net result is that everyone loses out.<p>These students are commonly known as special needs students, and I think this very accurately represents them. Some of the children require just a few minutes extra attention, others require regular confirmation, and others require practically no extra care other than being aware of some issue. I have never personally had to deal with a student with Down&#x27;s Syndrome, however I know of some family friends with children who have Down&#x27;s Syndrome. If you have seen and talked to these parents, in very many cases these parents have to dedicate their lives to caring for these children. The same is true for many cases in students; If I as a teacher have two students that require constant attention (for whatever reason) that means the rest of the students don&#x27;t get the attention they deserve, and the two students I am dealing with don&#x27;t get the help they deserve either.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the best solution is here, but I can&#x27;t see having a large number of (excuse the wording, I can&#x27;t think of a better word) difficult students such as those with aspergers/autism, Down&#x27;s Syndrome etc. being a good one.<p>The only point I can make on it is that in most cases, the transition to high school involves classes being split, and separation from friends. If students such as Henri can be sent to the same school as their friends, but possibly separated from others (which is what happens currently; students with severe mental difficulties are sent to separate schools) they can receive the individual attention and care that they deserve, but still be in the same environment as their friends and companions.<p>I tried to be very careful with my wording here, and I apologise if I insulted anyone, it was not my intention.",1401358092

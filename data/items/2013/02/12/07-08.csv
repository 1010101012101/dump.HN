5205733,comment,5205258,5205706,2,0,jasonjei,,,"I used to be in the office all the time. What ended up happening was that I ended up becoming a tutor and they weren't gaining the skills of an experienced programmer. The best thing you can do is force them to look up things. It's probably even a good idea that all questions go through Skype or email because you can answer them on your own schedule; meanwhile, you force them to work for the answers.<p>For example, I had to teach a fresh Comp Sci kid how to link to a C library several times. He had no idea how compilers or linkers worked aside from his school programming assignments.  I taught him how to do this in VS and GCC Makefiles at least 3 times, and he still didn't learn it because he could turn around and ask me. I've learned you only force someone to learn when you don't provide them answers. You do yourself and that person a disservice by spoon feeding solutions.",1360655961

Even if they write something that is flat out wrong, someone will probably tell them and everyone might learn. Also I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss building websites on Django (or any other framework) as easy. I imagine many things are easier, but I bet many things are harder as well, I'd think you'd be surprised at how quickly ""good"" designs go to shit when business requirements change every two weeks and how this effects development.",1360655905

It's not only possible, but it's much better to do this remotely.<p>I've found that when people receive criticism remotely, it tends to escalate into ""I feel this way because I read this: <insert link here>"".  Then a debate proceeds about the merits of one approach or another.  When people receive criticism IRL, it's much more common to be defensive, because the references are not immediately available and there's a desire to resolve the disparity immediately.<p>I google everything (at least, when I'm outside of the office), and if I have two minutes to google anything before responding, the quality of my discourse will always be higher.",1360655836

There's an opportunity cost to everything, and for many apps, security is not as important as convenience, ease-of-use, performance, or features.<p>Witness Dropbox vs. TarSnap.  Dropbox has had multiple serious security vulnerabilities published.  TarSnap is by the FreeBSD security officer.  Yet Dropbox is the one with the million+ users and $B+ market cap, because grandma cares a lot more about being able to figure out how to use the product than about what happens when the product gets hacked.",1360655828

5205723,comment,5204388,5205075,1,0,vitalique,,,"This is the proper approach, I suppose. I don't use images for button labels in Gmail's interface myself, but I'm pretty sure that properly designed icons + tooltips with verbs (for both icons and textual labels) can be used quite effectively to differentiate between verbs and nouns: 'arrows' icons as verbs for moving stuff, 'boxes' images as nouns for storage places, 'tools' as verbs for some particular actions associated with those particular tools, etc. - just your usual common sense UI stuff.<p>Switched Gmail settings to icons for buttons just to check if this is being used here and immediately notice annoying inconsistency in Gmail's UI: Archive button has an icon of a storage box with an arrow (good choice), but has ambiguous tooltip saying 'Archive', whilst Delete button has an icon of just a trash bin with a proper action-tooltip 'Delete'. 'Report spam' has the worst icon by far, I think. Then again - manila folder icon for moving to label (which is a bit unclear) - it acts very much like the 'archive' action, but somehow doesn't have an arrow. Labels button tooltip -  'Labels' - also lacks the word 'apply/attach/add'. I understand that you <i>can</i> get accustomed to almost anything, but this doesn't mean you have to fight your way through UI.<p>I thought a bit more about this and now I think that a verb is more or less mandatory for buttons of actions, i.e. for buttons that change some objects properties or performs actions on the objects ('Apply labels', 'Move to trash' are probably better than 'Labels', 'Trash'). Verbs are not mandatory for buttons that just change your position inside the system ('Go to inbox' is probably worse than 'Inbox').",1360655709

Why don't you tell that to some refugees; that's just incredible. I think you're letting some sort of cultural relativism cloud your judgment.<p>It is unstable not in the sense of ""who is going to rule the country."" It is unstable in the sense of they behave irrationally, have irrational beliefs and motivations.

Naively, we could solve that case by running the timesteps of the simulation slower than the greatest latency (or more accurately, when heartbeats from all players have been received for a given timestep).

As long as there is good motivation and discipline and trust remote working can work perfectly well over Skype. Code reviews done through Skype will be incredibly resourceful.<p>However, if there is lack of trust or discipline, this will not work. But then again, if you are having this problem you should really reconsider whom you hire! I hire my guys as interns, and I can quickly figure out who I want and who I'll wish the best of luck after the internship is over (my internships are just really long interviews): the ones who can figure things out themselves, the ones who go through an issue tracker and look for new things to do, the ones who will constantly ask things on Skype. You can't mentor self-sufficiency!<p>Bottom line: the people you want to hire aren't going to be needing constant babysitting. Those people will do it themselves.<p>Everyone is much happier because people work where they want to work.  We still have 1 day a week where we all meet up in person (granted, that's still <i>optional</i>, but everyone shows up for camaraderie, and I bribe them with lunch). I work from many places, on my own time--and so does everyone else. As long as their output is roughly meeting the mean productivity of everyone else, it will work.<p>Here's another thought: when you bring someone on board, get them to work on a fun project. For example, I have my guys build apps with Twilio that book tables at OpenTable automatically using mechanize. Some fun apps will get them to learn a framework and language very quickly.",1360655266

If you can solve your problem without writing code (or even better, by deleting code), that is the best solution.<p>Next, write code which fits your architecture. Sometimes functional composition is the best system for representing your computational structure. Tree operations, for example, are especially amenable to recursive function-based computation.<p>Sometimes, when you are writing a state machine, for example, an object is the best possible representation. Objects are entirely focused around hidden-implementation finite state machines, and thus mirror your computation almost exactly.<p>Funny how most people who have only practical training in a handful of languages and no programming language theory at all tend to advocate for the one style of programming that they know well. When all you have is a hammer...<p>Note: The small paragraph at the end of this article seems to hedge by agreeing with me and essentially calling the reader to disregard what he previously wrote.

5205595,comment,5205108,5205418,2,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"The longer historical context is that in the 90's the PRNK agreed to hand over their future nuclear power infrastructure to us, in exchange for abandoning a weapons program. Domestic political winds shifted, and the USA chose not to honor the agreement by congress strangling funds. Instead we paid them oil as a substitute. Things broke down further in the Bush 'axis of evil' period.<p>PRNK's behavior right now seems to be about pushing the USA back to something like the prior agreement, likely because they see the Obama administration as more open to this possibility. Honestly this would probably be a win for everyone, particularly if it included opening up a labor trade between north and south Korea. North Korea is impoverished, but their citizenry is actually quite well educated (if indoctrinated). If economic sanctions were weakened, there's little question that access to north Korean labor would be in high demand globally. There are a lot of challenges to making this happen. Possibly the hardest are social, and will simply take the passing of generations to ease.<p>There are also probably important PRC PRNK relationship dimensions to all this as well, of which I'm ignorant.",1360652732

That opinion states that the States enjoy immunity because it had been a long-standing practice going back to before they joined the union.  It&#x27;s a long-standing practice of many civilized nations that the nation itself does not enjoy immunity from prosecution.  If what Judge Kennedy wrote (Alden vs Maine happened in 1999!) isn&#x27;t a no-argument I wouldn&#x27;t know what is.<p>Also this: the State of Pennsylvania has committed grave injustice against thousands of its citizens.  If they cannot  get justice done through the courts what are they supposed to do instead?  Take recourse to Direct Action?  That&#x27;s not desirable in civilized society.  You can&#x27;t be your own judge and executioner.",1375837167

Or, is a hybrid the best approach (keep all the settings with their related areas, but also keep an aggregation of the settings somewhere as a &quot;master&quot; settings list)<p>An example to illustrate -- Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m building a RSS feed reader app (I&#x27;m not, promise) -- and I want people to be able to let&#x27;s say, subscribe to some RSS feeds. Now, I have a menu item on the top navigation bar that deals with Feeds (essentially, containing all the actions you can do that are related to &quot;feeds&quot;), so I can put an option like &quot;manage subscriptions&quot; there, and it will make sense.<p>HOWEVER, I also have a settings button on the top navigation bar -- Which arguably should also be able to manage subscriptions (as the things you are subscribed to could be considered settings)... So should I duplicate those other settings there?<p>If I lean in the direction of keeping the settings in their respective contexts, it seems to increase complexity. However, if I keep the settings in a big settings list, then it&#x27;s just overwhelming/tiresome.

6170162,comment,6169999,6169999,33,0,rayiner,,,"I don&#x27;t like the phrase &quot;sharing economy&quot; because I think that&#x27;s a misdescription of what&#x27;s actually happening. There is no sharing, in the sense of concurrent use. What&#x27;s happening, instead, is that technology is enabling more fine grained transactions in property. If you imagine a set of property rights as a multi-dimensional space, technology lowers the transaction costs involved in splitting up and transacting in sub-spaces of the larger set, and so makes such transactions practical. See: Coase&#x27;s &quot;The Nature of the Firm.&quot;<p>Sharing is something different. Sharing involves concurrent use of resources mediated by tort-like systems, rather than property-like systems. A real &quot;sharing economy&quot; in cars might be what you end up when cars become self-driving. You won&#x27;t own a car, but will use whichever car is nearby, and the law will punish various relevant anti-social behaviors instead of violations of property rights.<p>This distinction is very relevant to things like Uber or AirBnB, because the regulatory challenges there are various issues attached to property rights (e.g. zoning restrictions attached to houses, monopoly privileges attached to taxi medallions).<p>I agree with Genachowski that state and local governments are a battleground for innovation, but he makes it seem simpler than it is. It&#x27;s not just a matter of preventing local governments from enacting laws that restrict innovation. It&#x27;s more basic: renegotiating various privileges that have been negotiated into and priced into property rights. E.g. for better or worse, those who own cab medallions bargained for the monopoly they have, and gave up certain things in the process. Municipalities bargained to create telephone monopolies to serve rural areas instead of building infrastructure themselves. People who bought houses in residential neighborhoods did so pricing in the fact that those neighborhoods would not host hotels. Everyone thought these were reasonable policies at the time. Upsetting those settled expectations in property rights is going to be a very complicated process.<p>E.g. my personal regulatory interest is in spectrum sharing technology (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_spectrum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_spectrum</a>). Technology is getting close to the point where real &quot;sharing&quot; should be possible in radio spectrum. Not just fine-grained subdivision of property rights, but concurrent use mediated by tort-like mechanisms of enforcing &quot;sociable&quot; behavior. I think that technology needs to be rolled out all over the TV bands and the cellular bands. But it&#x27;s not just a simple matter of flipping a switch. Verizon and AT&T paid billions for their spectrum, under the assumption that there would be nobody else playing in it. You have to kind of see their point of view in opposition to measures to enable sharing on their property. Same for all of the TV companies. They didn&#x27;t pay for their spectrum, but they made tremendous investments based on certain assumptions, and they&#x27;ve got a right to question changes to those settled expectations.<p>Incidentally, this is not a new problem. The whole point of property rights is to settle expectations.

6170145,comment,6168926,6168926,15,0,govindkabra31,,,"Here is the original text of the article, since it has been taken down now.<p>My experience at a YC startup<p>This story needs to be told. I am an engineer turned business guy who recently left a cozy job at a top-tier tech company and joined a YC start-up. Needless to say I took a huge pay cut and a big risk. I talked extensively to one of the co-founders and he/she did an amazing job of selling me the opportunity. I got the sense that VCs were lining up for Series A (it was still early stage) and the company had amazing growth curve (numbers like growing 100% Mom etc.). Once i joined the startup, to my horror, I discovered a few things:<p><pre><code>    The company tried to raise Series A earlier and failed. 
    The numbers that were shared were not entirely true. It was kind of half-truth and part of the marketing pitch to VCs.
    The leadership was struggling with the vision of the company. It was pulled in many directions - sometimes ad-hoc based on customer feedback or angel advice.
    The culture was bad. Engineers were constantly told what to do. 
    The quality of the people were much lower vs my previous company.
</code></pre>
One of the first things I did was steer the company in the right direction from a strategy perspective. I constantly butted head with one of the founders but my strategies were clearly impacting the revenue numbers. For example one of the tactics doubled the weekly revenue. I wanted to have a significant impact so I was constantly asking the founders to work on the long-term vision and culture for the company. I also told them that VCs invested in talent and not the idea.<p>Then another round of raising Series A started. The nos&quot; started piling up. Our last hope said no&quot; 2 weeks back. And then I was asked to leave last week (though I was already planning to leave). I think they got what they needed out of me and now the first person to go would be the business guy (along with some other engineers and business folks). Actually the team is paying for the incompetence of the founding team.<p>I would add the disclaimer that my experience may not be reflective of every single YC startup. But I dont want you to make the same mistake so this is my piece of advice before you join an early-stage startup:<p><pre><code>    YC doesnt necessarily mean sure shot success. Paul Graham is a human and bound to make mistakes.
    Talk to as many team members as possible before joining. Try to gauge culture by visiting the office quite often. 
    Preferably join a startup where you know the people.
    If you dont know the people, work part-time for some time before making a decision.
    Ignore marketing pitches by founders.
    Go for post Series-A. VCs have already done the vetting for you.

Also, that&#x27;s ignoring the filesystem overhead which isn&#x27;t negligible even if it&#x27;s already cached. You&#x27;re basically turning your web server into a glorified shell script and even though all of your CGI scripts are compiled it&#x27;s still horribly inefficient. FastCGI on the other hand is basically like giving the web server a socket to a persistent process that runs the associated code in an existing thread instead of having to spawn a new one on every request.<p>Basically FastCGI is like having another server just for your dynamic content while the web server sits in front of it and takes care of hosting the static content and deferring to the FastCGI server when appropriate.",1375834892

What if they see a closing lift and jump in, not realising it's not a general purpose lift, but one that only stops in certain predefined places. They'll have to get out at the next stop and start again.<p>You have to ask yourself why these lifts are a good idea for the user. If they reduce wait times by 10% I doubt the users of them will care. The convenience of being able to get a lift to stop where you want it to from the inside is more useful IMHO<p>I really can't see them becoming common place.",1198237142

One is an elected official subject to the transparency of a democracy and who costs lives and billions of dollars when he lies. The other is the CEO of a commercial enterprise who's a control freak and occasionally gets a little nasty with people who leak news about his gadgets.",1198236237

And it would probably be helpful for the ""student"" to set goals for the tasks. Maybe choose from a set of goals.",1198235042

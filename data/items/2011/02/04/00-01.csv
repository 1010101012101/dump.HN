Volunteer at a homeless shelter or do something else that has the potential to move you to tears and make you feel your problems are just kind of whiny and insignificant.  Not to belittle your pain, but to give yourself a larger view -- and to expose you to strong emotion of the cleansing kind.  If you're torn up to the point of distraction about being dumped by someone who said mean things to you, then you probably need to live more.  There are much bigger, grittier things going on in the world.  Go take a sip from the firehose of life and forget this person.<p>Peace.  And good luck in your journey.",1296781151

They were not in the US but usually in some other country. I used to have really bad insomnia and when it was 3am in California, most of America was asleep. But it was midday elsewhere and there were people awake in such places and willing to talk to me. Nor did I mean to indicate they were specifically ""hard workers"".  But they were people who understood doing things that are uncomfortable on many levels, making really big sacrifices for something one values and so on in a way that seems alien to many Americans.<p>I have a form of cystic fibrosis and I have given up all my furniture and I sleep on the floor.  I can't tell you how many people I have met online who are desperately ill and would clearly rather die a slow torturous death than contemplate giving up their couch.  I can't relate to the idea of desperately clinging to your material possessions when they are helping to kill you and they cannot relate to my choice to have almost no possessions in order to be drug free and breathe without pain.  Foreigners are typically much more understanding of that choice and are much more likely to be civil to me on a CF list where many Americans openly attack me and moderators frequently side with my attackers.<p>Europeans often have more holidays and do more traveling than Americans but don't usually have as many material possessions -- like a TV in every room of the house -- and aren't generally as steeped in North American ""affluenza"".

This maximises creativity and productivity and boosts GDP. Musicians, inventors, artists, authors, drug companies and software developers all rely on this principle.  If we didn't have copyright and patents and robots.txt then there would be no incentive to produce half of the things people want, and we would all be much worse off.

The democratic government in the US gives, among other things, critical access to information and regulation of self interested actors. It's the checks and balances that are important. Elected and non-elected officials, civil servants and private actors. Even if I bought your argument that the government is just some self interested autonomous agent (which I do not), we still have control, and most important <i>information</i> about it. That information gives us power.<p>A private entity does not answer to the public, not truly if there is no information. If they act in way that is unethical or undesirable, they simply hide it from the public. With no reliable information flow (forget for a moment the Internet would not exist in your governmentless world), there is no way of controlling these entities.

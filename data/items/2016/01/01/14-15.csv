People come into a long-lived codebase and naturally fall into the same thought traps, wanting to rewrite the same parts for the same misguided reasons. There is a principle here to follow on a new codebase, that of &#x27;senseless inaction&#x27;, meaning that as long as something doesn&#x27;t make any sense to you yet, you should refrain from making deep changes to it. Only once insight is formed on why the seemingly completely pointless and bizarre feature exists and what purpose it is serving, then can a deep change to it be safely considered. Tragically, the natural instinct is to lay off the parts that make sense and to rewrite the parts that don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s a guaranteed way to make a product unsuitable for the business it is in, because the weirder a feature is, the more adapted it is to the real world (most of the time).",1451658982

Now suppose the good jobs and services left from a huge swathe of the country and continued to do so, forcing people to move to a smaller number of more expensive urban areas if they wanted work. Since there&#x27;s only a limited amount of land area, this would force up prices in those urban areas, making people worse off in real terms as they were forced to pour more of their income into a smaller house and had less to spend on everything else, but would show up as a decrease in poverty as their expensive house got more expensive.

On the other hand, the articles complaining about &quot;safe spaces&quot; and &quot;silencing&quot; carefully avoid repeating what the person supposedly being silenced actually said, because they know it&#x27;ll hurt their argument if - for example - they admit that a particular feminist wasn&#x27;t welcome because she&#x27;d successfully campaigned for trans women to be denied access to rape counselling and domestic violence services.<p>I&#x27;m more worried about articles like this one.

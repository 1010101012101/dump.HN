I need motivation to keep training and what better motivation is there than statistics? Statistics rock for motivation! Having your training data and graphs and everything is pretty cool.<p>How am I going to tackle this problem? I am thinking of a cross between a Wii Fit and a Kinect. It would be a web app (for people training at home with free weights for example) or maybe a mobile app (for gyms and on the road). The point is : it would keep your stats with as little intervention needed, using maybe voice recognition or a webcam to count how many lifts you do for a certain exercice for example. Let's say you lift dumbells and you count them out loud while doing it, the app would pick up your voice counting your reps and would automatically save your data when you finish your training.<p>Any idea/thoughts on this? Thanks!",1308232754

Voting is then done based purely on financials and often short term gains, which really puts a company at odds with their customers. So I have no customer loyalty to a company that's publicly traded.<p>Many private companies can still maintain my loyalty though based purely on their actions if the owner(s) / investors aren't completely disconnected from their customers. That's more of a case by case. The smaller they are, the more likely they care about their customers (there are always exceptions though).",1308232671

That is, have to pay for a coal plant to use when the wind is not blowing.  Then the coal plant operator will have to raise his rates to cover his CapEx for the time his plant is not operating.  Bummer.<p>On average in the US, at the plant, nukes have been under 2 cents per KWh and coal has been under 3 cents.  In comparison, the dreams of the people pushing 'clean, renewable' energy would shoot the US economy in the gut.<p>For the probability, that's a silly issue:  The Mayan priests who killed people to pour blood on a rock to keep the sun moving across the sky (I have a reference to a scholarly book on the Mayans, and Google books or Amazon shows the page with the specifics) picked a good problem:  The Mayans didn't know enough to debunk the priests.<p>Al Guru did the same:  Solid science for what the climate will be in 50 years under various scenarios for human activity does not exist.  In particular, about the only way we know to calculate the 'climate' is from 'first principles' of physics and chemistry, and that involves actually predicting the weather, each cubic millimeter or so, INCLUDING the oceans, all over the planet for each millisecond or so for 50 years, and we can't do that computing.  [Note:  All simplifications are not from first principles and are approximations of unknown accuracy.  So, can't actually calculate all the clouds in detail, put in a simple model for the clouds; for the oceans, do something still simpler.]<p>Then for the 'climate', need to do the full calculation, do that computing for a narrow distribution of initial conditions around the conditions now.  Big problem:  We don't even know the initial conditions, e.g., in the depths of the oceans and their currents, accurately.  Anyway, run the weather prediction a few million times and then take empirical distributions and find the climate.  Then change the scenario of human activity, do it again, and compare.<p>Tough to do.  Hasn't been done.<p>Similarly for a gamma ray burst blowing the atmosphere off the earth, Yellowstone wiping out much of the US, a moving black hole sucking up the earth, some microbe we don't know how to kill wiping out humanity, etc.<p>So, what do we do?  Well, we do NOT fall for superstition and gurus like the Mayans did.  We don't go for morality plays about evil humans with transgression from evil, retribution from an angry god, and redemption from sacrifice.  We don't sacrifice lambs or virgins.  And we don't sacrifice our coal plants, half of our electric power.<p>For 'global warming', first, we look at the arguments of Al Guru, Guru Ramaswamy, etc., move forward to their first absurd, outrageous, egregious, grotesquely incompetent and/or dishonest point and then flush their arguments and reject those gurus.  For Al Guru, the time between the high temperatures and the high CO2 levels he didn't show in the Vostok data is enough to flush his stuff.  For the IPCC and Guru Ramaswami, his 'radiative forcing' is enough to flush.<p>So, for the alarmists, we have nothing but superstition.<p>So, we have to proceed on our own.<p>So, we start:  Is there any empirical evidence that the earth is getting warmer now?  We can measure temperature with astounding accuracy, and now with satellites we can get good data for the whole planet, day by day.  May I have the envelope, please?  ""Nope, there's no evidence.""<p>For a little more, as far as we can tell (I'm sure you have the NAS report), the temperature now is exactly the same as it was before the start of the Little Ice Age caused, maybe, by missing sun spots for some decades.  So, since then we've been pulling out of the Little Ice Age and, net, since just before the Little Ice Age, all of human activity has had zip, zilch, zero effect on temperature.  Net, human caused global warming doesn't pass the sniff test.<p>Next, what about the science?  Do we worry about CO2, methane, water vapor, chlorinated hydrocarbons, aerosols?  First- cut, changes in any of these seem to be at most small and trivial.<p>Next, what is the record on climate variability?  Well, there's been a lot of variability.  So, that we see nothing going on now means, first-cut, no worries, mate.<p>Next, if there we do begin to see some changes, then we will address the issue again.<p>The idea that the climate is wildly 'unstable' (got'a stop those evil butterflies from flapping their wings) and that we are at a tipping point and point of no return, with no good evidence, we have to pass off as superstitious nonsense like the Mayans.<p>Net, we're not Mayans.  We don't wreck our society for superstitious fears.  We just don't do that.<p>No sale.  Ain't buying.<p>Done.",1308231523

2661074,comment,2657554,2657554,1,0,crux,,,"I have to agree with some other commenters that although this article is accurate enough, it establishes a view of introversion that's so rigidly determined, so reified, and so self-perpetuating and self-justifying that I find it hard to recognize and certainly hard to endorse as a lifestyle. The personality type and lifestyle here is a sort of baseline tendency for introverts (like myself), but there's so much more leeway and growth possible within the most introverted soul that it makes me a little sad to see something so pat about these tendencies (and the whole dopamine thingwell, let's just say I Am Not A Neuroscientist but I suspect that Dr. Laney isn't one either).<p>A couple commenters have suggested that instead of wholly embracing these practicesespecially the ones about being rude to peopleit's advantageous, for job purposes, to meet women, to learn to at least put up with talking to other people. To be honest it's been kind of entertaining to hear from introverts who view the great extroverted mob like an enemy camp, to be infiltratedat great personal expense, but to great personal rewardby learning to mimic their ways.<p>I want to suggest that it's possible to actually learn to enjoy being social and meeting people. You know, for its own sake. While it's true that eventually one will find that they might need to make relationships with other people so they can do camping trips and get laid and such, I have found that actually humanizing people, rather than treating them as ends to means, is more satisfying and healthy in the long run. Further, while it's nice to try to maintain a few close relationships, I think it's more satisfying and healthy to learn to get beyond a simplistic superficial/real binary with your human relationshipsand by extension, with other people.<p>There are lots of ways to be introverted without seeing nearly the whole raft of humanity as psychic vampires, or insensitive extroverts, or simply resource repositories that you need to interact with. If you treat a work relationship or a bank teller with this attitude of, 'I'm not interested in superficial small talk. You only exist to me for the purposes of sending and receiving information or resources', you will not ONLY be alone when you want to go camping, but you will also be spiritually and emotionally impoverished.<p>The good news is, it IS possible to learn to enjoy talking with other people, even if it's ultimately tiring. I mean, most things in life are tiring. That's the nature of energywe spend it on doing things. But you can be mindful of your energy level (and I might suggest, blood sugar) without having to abstain from all human contact. In fact, you can even enjoy human contact. The last 8 or so years of my life has been in a large part about learning to enjoy human contactand I've learned to enjoy it by learning to be _good_ at it. I am now, I am glad to say, a pretty charming guy. I tell good stories, I meet people well, I dress well, I make a good impression. This means that I don't have trouble meeting women or finding partners for the activities that I like, but it also means that I derive actual satisfaction from the practice of social skills. I like exercising my expertise, like most people, and I like the rewards I getsocial reinforcement, positive feedback, that sort of thing. And I think that's been the key for me. I didn't decide to embark on a project of self-improvement and socialization because it was necessary for my eventual professional success. I learned to get off on doing a good job at social behavior. Introvert or not, it still _feels good_ to be a charming, likeable person. It just means I take a nap afterwards.",1308229885

On the internet, the audience is quite wide, and disagreement / outrage usually leads more responses / activity than does agreement and acceptance. I should say, in fact, that agreement leads to further sharing, whereas disagreement leads to comments. Thus, an article that some people agree with and some disagree with, gets re-shared and exposed to a lot of controversy. That eventually finds its way into other outlets, whereby each compelling article has a counter-article somewhere else in addition to all the substance-free vitriolic comments.<p>What the internet has really done is stop letting us get away with echo chambers, by breaking the walls between them.

I think Bertrand Russell said: &quot;The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.&quot; Now, those doubts are reinforced by the threat of being shown wrong. I think it&#x27;s quite an art to articulate compelling arguments out of factually true statements, and even more of an art to think several steps ahead, choose which statements to focus on in order to draw certain reactions from an audience, and thus build receptivity to your next statements. Daniel Dennett said: You should be able to understand your opponent&#x27;s arguments so well that you can say it back and they say &quot;I wish I had put it that way&quot;.

So, Paypal as a whole decides not to place a hold.<p>2. Paypal&#x27;s payment processing department worries about the risk of your account, so they place a hold on your deposits. In parallel, the loan department decides you&#x27;re a good credit risk, and so you apply for and receive a loan for the same amount as the hold.<p>In case 1, if those payments do indeed get charged back, Paypal is forced to try to come after you for the balance. Unfortunately, this debt won&#x27;t have very strong legal standing, because it&#x27;s not backed by a loan agreement. They might or might not get their money back. It also puts them in the position of having to chase you for the money.<p>In case 2, if the payments get charged back, Paypal is sitting on the funds already, and can just claim them. This might cause you to default on the loan, but that&#x27;s your problem now, not PayPal&#x27;s. They are also making interest on the amount of the loan.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that Case 2 is MUCH better for PayPal, and only marginally worse for you, assuming that you are right about the payments all being good -- you are only out the interest cost on the money. What you seem to be arguing is that PayPal should be &quot;nice&quot; to you and go with Case 1.<p>The other fact that you might be missing is that nearly all traditional payment processors would require some kind of reserve account in situations like this, and even if they weren&#x27;t holding the money, they require that they have withdrawal privileges on the account into which the funds deposit so that they can claw back money if needed. PayPal is by no means unusual or abusive in holding funds, it just seems that way because they don&#x27;t pitch this as part of their up-front marketing.",1452196112

10860211,comment,10859383,10859383,0,0,grellas,,,"I find internet writing to be stimulating in its own way precisely because it is a sort of dash-off writing that does not need to be as precise or exact as would be needed if you were seeking to meet professional standards.<p>To wit, in law, even in formal contexts, lawyers dish off all sorts of slop in legal briefs, etc. but this really is sub-standard lawyering. To do your job right, you need to meet standards of excellence in making sure you have sound analysis, careful factual recitation, and skilled application of law to facts as you make arguments or seek to achieve some other professional writing goal. This is true as well in less formal professional settings such as writing emails/letters to clients. It may not absolutely matter what you say in terms of precision if a client is not likely to pick up the fine points but it really does matter in terms of maintaining a consistent pride in your professional work. Slop is slop and, when people will evaluate you by how well you are representing a client, it is critical not to be slipshod in your writing.<p>When writing on the internet, in contrast, you of course want to avoid putting out slop there as well but a lot less precision is needed to make your points. If you make a legal point, it is implied by context that you are making a statement that may not be accurate down to the finest level of detail, that you may be simplifying, or generalizing, or simply venting an opinion that the law may or may not support. Law in itself will vary, even greatly, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this means that much of what you may be saying is really setting forth broad principles while avoiding a specific application to a given case. For these purposes, there is no need to be defensive, not in the slightest. And I certainly try not to be. Am I ever wrong? Of course, on occasion, yes - I have had a doozie or two in my time, perhaps a number of them. But you try to feel secure about such lapses, knowing that we all err occasionally, and try as a whole to conform to an overall solid record of being as accurate and insightful as possible. While you get the occasional harsh attack, for the most part I have found that people will be charitable knowing that you may have spent no more than 10 or 15 minutes trying to address a sometimes complex topic. Better to give people the benefit of your insights if it is an area where you can do so than it is to leave something in the internet conversion that is wrong or off simply hanging out there. That is a great benefit of the internet. Back in the day, you had to dig deep to find out what people with expertise in their field were thinking and access to this was severely limited. The internet has changed all that. There may be a lot of slop out there but there are also many gems that are there for the taking. As writers, we should be ready to share, if not gems, at least our best thoughts on topics where people might find them helpful.<p>If I were to stray from my professional topics, then maybe I would be more defensive as well. But the author of this piece emphasizes how the internet may hinder academic writing and I see legal writing as at least broadly similar. So, my experience differs pretty markedly.<p>Just my two cents.",1452195971

In <i>that</i> context I agree with Matt.<p>> Now, I don&#x27;t think all academic research has to be relevant to industry. In some sense, the best research (albeit the riskiest and often hardest to fund) is stuff going way beyond where industry is focused today. Many academics kind of kid themselves about how forward-thinking their work is, though. Working on biomolecular computation? That&#x27;s far out. Working on building a faster version of MapReduce? Not so much. I&#x27;d argue most academics work on the latter kind of problem -- and that&#x27;s fine! -- but don&#x27;t pretend you&#x27;re immune from industry relevance just because you&#x27;re in a university.<p>This paragraph makes this point abundantly clear: there&#x27;s plenty of research that is focussed on expanding the field and is <i>discovering</i> problems that <i>will</i> exist once industry catches up. Fantastic. It&#x27;s risky to try and find the future, but someone has to do it, and I think (based on this and his other writing that I&#x27;ve encountered) Matt would agree that time spent in industry is of dubious utility to those folks[0].<p>For research that is attempting to tackle extant problems encountered by industry, though, the researcher would be well served by ensuring that the problem they&#x27;re attempting to solve is actually extant <i>and</i> that the assumptions they&#x27;re making in trying to solve it don&#x27;t simply sound reasonable but actually reasonably embody assumptions underlying real (aka industry) deployments. Otherwise they may get a lovely paper which solves a problem that nobody actually has or presents a solution that is impractical because it assumes things which are, in real deployments, incorrect.<p>[0]: On one hand, it might give them a better feel for in which direction a tractable future lies, but by the same token it might prevent them from exploring potentially fruitful avenues by constraining their thinking.",1452195665

Feel free to email me <my HN username> at gmail<p>Start by getting paid gigs so you can start building up your two year window of experience, most of your learning will happen on paid projects so try connecting locally with anyone needing even a basic website.<p>This way you can start earning some money and learning on the job.<p>You can start simple as a sole proprietor, no need for spending time and money on an LLC or Inc initially.<p>Not sure where you are in the learning process but here are some thoughts. Once you have html and css and hosting under your belt you can create basic websites for local businesses.<p>I always recommend starting with HTML and CSS (check out the head first HTML and CSS book, it&#x27;s a great place to start).<p>Develop locally on MAMP or WAMP (go mac if you can, a macbook air 13&quot; is perfect, grab an external monitor off amazon if you need more screen space). Use sublime text for your editor.<p>Get a simple shared hosting account and domain name to play around with setting up a domain (DNS, A record, pointing it to your hosting (Add on subdomains). You can use filezilla to FTP files up and down.<p>Go through the head first html and css book, working both locally and setting up sites on your hosting.<p>After that install wordpress.org locally and on your hosting, it will help you get familiar with php and mysql, there is a lot to learn using wordpress but some of your clients might be interested for making their own edits.<p>After that you can go through the headfirst javascript book.<p>Then I would work through their jQuery book.<p>Next go through the php and mysql book.<p>So after that you&#x27;ll be ready to start a simple web app. I would recommend creating a basic one using just PHP (no framework). Setup a login, logout, dashboard, to do list or other personal tracking project. You don&#x27;t need to spend lots of time on it just see how things work behind the scenes.<p>After that I would move to a framework Laravel (php) and Rails (ruby). I would play around with both to see which one you like. Laracasts.com and Railscast.com are great learning locations.<p>I think laravel is easier to learn. Use Homestead (local virtual machine box) and forge ($10/mo) for deployment to Digital Ocean ($5-$10/mo to start).<p>Not all this can take some time. If you have a knack for doing this you can take on local projects or even projects you aren&#x27;t sure you can handle and learn on the job.<p>A contract is best, but for local projects and most remote I work with just a scope of work and quote in an email.<p>I typically invoice incrementally esp. with new clients to make sure they are paying and happy with your work.<p>So feel free to break projects down in to small milestones so you don&#x27;t work on something a week and then have the client say this isn&#x27;t what I want we&#x27;re done here.<p>I usually invoice 50% for a milestone up front, then the remaining amount and 50% of the next milestone is due upon delivery of that milestone for review and don&#x27;t start the next milestone till that is paid. Client can provide feedback from milestones during the process and those are updated if they are with in scope. New features outside scope = new milestone/quote for additional work.<p>(lots of thoughts on invoicing/process but this will get you started).<p>As far as your direction. I would work toward software developer/web app developer with Rails or Laravel. Rails is probably higher pay and more jobs but laravel is coming along. You can do full stack for web app development, but there is a lot to learn.<p>Check out angular and vue.<p>Also for your web apps check out mandrill(email) and stripe(payments).<p>Good luck with your transition, it&#x27;s a long road, and will take a while to get back to your previous salary.

That would allow a prospect to review them and see which side they think is more legitimate.<p>We recognize that decentralized reputation systems are basically the holy grail of p2p systems and we don&#x27;t even pretend to be solving the problem, only giving users some information to make a more informed decision. I expect that many moderators will choose to publicly identify themselves and use their IRL reputation as well.<p>>Last question: How will the leadership/dev of OpenBazaar be structured in the future? Will you guys develop something similar to the Linux Foundation under a non-profit charter? Will the foundation enact a transaction fee to fund itself?<p>No transaction fees. It&#x27;s open source, so even if we wanted to do this it would likely fail because people could always fork it and remove the fee.<p>Right now many of the core devs are a part of a company called OB1 (I&#x27;m a co-founder). We received $1 million from Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz in order to lead development of the platform, push for network adoption, and then offer services to users on the network.",1452194991

It is quite well established that sticky prices screw with efficient market theory quite a bit, and the scenario provided by the gp sounds like a good candidate for a sticky price scenario.<p>edit: After thinking about this a little bit, let me go further. The parent&#x27;s statement is veering into efficient market theory dogma territory. Causality is much more difficult to determine in macroeconomics than in sciences that have the benefit of controlled experiments. There are significant competing theories to efficient market theory that have things to say about scenarios like this, so a straight declaration of cause without caveats is misleading, particularly since efficient market theory clearly does not hold in many observed scenarios. Above, I&#x27;m not saying that sticky prices necessarily are the cause of the results that the gp is describing (or even corroborating that the scenario is something that necessarily happens), I&#x27;m just showing that the problem probably isn&#x27;t as clear cut as the parent suggests.",1452194956

Note that while the below sounds racist; I&#x27;m referring explicitly to the governments themselves.<p>> There are challenges to investing in either China or India, but the reasons behind those challenges are about as different as you can get. The underlying issues in the two countries are dramatically different.<p>I agree; and you probably know this all, so it&#x27;s for others&#x27; benefit. China is a centrally-planned economy that has transitioned to a capitalist-style oligarchy. Culturally, they value society as a whole as being more important than the individual or individual groups. The Chinese government is still the ultimate authority, though many factions exist within the Communist party. Everything coming from the central Communist party is reviewed and OKed by a dozen officials to ensure a consistent story - so any bad numbers are a result of deliberate overstatement at some level. It also means that stakeholders at every level have the opportunity and incentive to falsify numbers (because missing your numbers means losing your job and ending up in poverty). It&#x27;s not a giant conspiracy; but there is little downside to falsifying accounting numbers (which will get you a prison sentence in the US).<p>India is on the opposite end of the spectrum - it&#x27;s basically a free-for-all with a bunch of very different groups of people pushed together to try to make it work. There are thousands of ethnic groups, many of whom hate each other. So in order to keep the peace, they have to allow each ethnic group a wide berth. This means that when you say &quot;the Indian government&quot; you&#x27;re talking about an entity that is a multi-headed hydra (or even multiple hydras). There are many competing desires and biases present in the Indian government, and it&#x27;s politically difficult to deal with those problems when your population is as fragmented as India&#x27;s is (and why the election of a more modern leader with a global focus like Modi was a huge step forward).",1452193878

He was even an entrepreneur, making money off of what we&#x27;d now call &quot;micro-lending&quot;. So when the communists came to power, grandfather could easily predict that the communists weren&#x27;t going to like him very much. (My mom and her younger brother were smuggled south in a freighter in a pitch black compartment.)<p>When you next watch &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; keep this in mind: The morality portrayed was basically the morality of the real world up until the 1700s, and then it only slowly started to improve. It&#x27;s going to be a long process. We&#x27;re still at it.",1452193322

Like so many things MySQL rushed out the door, it&#x27;s also buggy and unpredictable. Did you know UPSERTing into a MySQL table with multiple unique indexes can result in duplicate records?

Buy and hold investors already own the stock so their preferences are not reflected in short term supply/demand uniformity (price stability).<p>What we&#x27;re seeing in China is a lack of uniformity of views on the future price, and thus rapid fluctuations in supply/demand uniformity over time. Government instability plays into that tremendously.",1452193255

Regulation might be too much/too less in some areas but that will eventually improve. OTOH, China is very close to dictatorial, with the government controlling everything from the exchange rate to every company&#x27;s policies. For example, we have proper public debates in India about stuff like net neutrality, freedom of the press, and we routinely criticize the government and politicians. That is simply not possible in China.<p>I really do not understand how anybody with even a little understanding of the two countries can lump India and China together in the same political/financial group.",1452193253

8657681,comment,8657135,8657453,0,0,lmm,,,"I&#x27;ve long thought OCaml was weirdly suppressed. It&#x27;s a language that makes a lot of sense for a lot of problems; the only thing I can think is maybe people were put off by thinking strongly typed = java? It&#x27;s particularly irritating that the Go folks never seemed to have looked at it, since their language could stand to learn a lot from OCaml.<p>Maybe the language is finally hitting critical mass? Maybe lots of people are hitting the same shaped problems at this stage in the evolution of our cloud platforms? Maybe it&#x27;s just dumb luck?<p>For your specific things: Rust is probably not mature enough yet but worth keeping an eye on. Go makes me cry. Scala does a lot of the same things OCaml does as well or better, at least if you &quot;stick to the good parts&quot; (there&#x27;s a ton of extraneous crap in Scala); if you&#x27;re in an environment where the JVM is acceptable then TBH you won&#x27;t gain ever so much from having both in your toolbox.<p>Haskell is the tough one. My take is that purity is a very heavy burden, and even the most advanced language in the world can only go so far to alleviating that. But the power it grants you can be huge - or can not. If you find purity worthwhile, go with Haskell. But if you just want the functional power boost and don&#x27;t want to immediately expend most of it on carefully tracking your effects, OCaml is a perfectly good choice; at the least, it&#x27;s an incremental improvement in the Haskelly direction, without having to wear the hair shirt right away. I&#x27;d say much the same for Scala.",1416923634

This release announcement was pretty well received here on HN[1].  After reading the commentary here and looking at Flow I&#x27;ve found myself reading more about OCaml.  It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me that others did the same and decided to share interesting articles they found.<p>I imagine the bubbles of popularity you mention are regularly kicked off by a similar event.

As such, you develop instrument software, analysis tools, support tools etc. which supports your core business and give it away for free.<p>This does 2 things:<p>1. If your open source package gains widespread adoption, it gives you control of the tools that most users in your area use.<p>2. It levels the playing field and takes software out of the equation to a degree. Competitors have little reason to develop their own platforms when they can leverage yours.<p>----<p>In addition to that, I think FOSS software is valuable almost everywhere else, but as you say, does lead to different models.<p>Data analysis software is probably a good example of this. You write the analysis software, it gains widespread adoption. You provide a data analysis as a consulting service.

Which one is most appropriate depends on what kind of things you&#x27;re working with.<p>Working with vector spaces over a given field: &quot;bigger&quot; means &quot;higher dimension&quot;. Working with manifolds: &quot;bigger&quot; means &quot;higher dimension&quot;. Working with sets: &quot;bigger&quot; usually means &quot;larger cardinality&quot; but could sometimes mean &quot;proper superset&quot;.<p>In general, you can take &quot;X is bigger than Y&quot; to mean &quot;Y is isomorphic to some substructure of X, but not vice versa&quot;. If &quot;isomorphic&quot; means &quot;in bijection with&quot; and &quot;substructure&quot; means &quot;subset&quot; then this is cardinality. If they mean &quot;isomorphic as vector spaces over F&quot; and &quot;vector subspace&quot; then it&#x27;s dimension. If they mean &quot;homeomorphic&quot; and &quot;topological subspace&quot; then actually it isn&#x27;t true that lower-dimensional manifolds are always &quot;smaller than&quot; higher-dimensional ones (so maybe we actually want a different definition) but in this particular case the rank-1 tensors are a lower-dimensional proper subspace of all the tensors so the definition gives the &quot;right&quot; answer.",1416923068

No mobile app I could build in three months was going to deliver that.&quot;<p>In summary, our economy is too small for our population, so minorities and others defined as undesirables get heartlessly kicked out of the economy.  I don&#x27;t like it, but that&#x27;s the facts of our ever shrinking economic system and ever expanding population.  So their plan is to use technology designed for the people still inside the system, on people outside the system, because by being insiders they are morally superior and should culturally imperialize the folks kicked out of the economy.  And if it works inside the system, being very provincial, they think that all that exists is the inside of their system, so obviously we need to re-educate those in another system to see things the one true insider way.  And despite having been kicked out of the economy, they are assumed to still have something that can be harvested from them that insiders value that isn&#x27;t already being harvested by efficient megacorps (walmart has all their money, you aren&#x27;t getting it).  And somehow its assumed imperialism is not only a good idea, but it should work if they just wish hard enough, despite centuries of past experience showing imperialism mostly just screws things up.  The whole thing is just nonsense on a big picture systemic level.<p>People kicked out of our economy already use logic and reasoning and technology, at least as much as our educational system permits them, to solve their own real problems, and this isn&#x27;t one of them.  In an era of hyper pervasive media they don&#x27;t need to be shown how the remaining rich/lucky people live, they&#x27;re drowning in it from the media and it causes little other than resentment.

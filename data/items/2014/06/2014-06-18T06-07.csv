The reworked Internet Explorer lets you search smarter and do more with its cool new features, such as multitasking, pinnable sites, and full-screen browsing.<p>Wherever you are, Internet Explorer is the ideal way to play games, catch up on your reading, watch videos, and browse the web, of course. Use fast and fluid Internet Explorer across all your Windows devices‚Äîtablet, Windows Phone, and TV with an Xbox with an Xbox Live Gold subscription.<p>This program is really a great way for bloggers and HN commenters to spread the word about the new Internet Explorer web experience in a cool, visual way. There&#x27;s also opportunities for fun prizes and rewards through duration of the program.",1403073177

The tricky bit though is that often times people don&#x27;t really know <i>why</i> the CEO acts as they do. And that is partly because there is information available to the CEO that isn&#x27;t available to just anyone, and partly because the CEO is often balancing problems and opportunities that aren&#x27;t necessarily visible to those outside their direct reports.<p>One of the first things I try to impress upon new managers is that their job is not about telling people what to do, rather their job is about getting the most done with the people they have on the most important parts of the problem.  They have to take the whole set of possible things that could be worked on, and figure out the important ones to invest in. Sometimes the importance comes from being or staying competitive, sometimes the importance comes from keeping things alive long enough to get to the next milestone.",1403073086

Perhaps it really just is faster to read and edit any and all versions of a story separately.<p>What you&#x27;re describing could work, but only if people changed the way they wrote to make it easy to cut things out without having to rewrite other things. But then you&#x27;re back to something like the inverted pyramid.<p>What we ended up doing instead was to give authors the ability to &quot;fork&quot; stories into different editions that are, from that moment on, edited completely independently from each other, but behind the scenes keep track of which parts of the story <i>are</i> still the same, so you can provide intelligent diffs, notifications and potentially even merges like &quot;In the web edition it talks about a guy named Jon but the print edition refers to John -- which is it?&quot; without changing the experience for writers and editors too much.",1403072586

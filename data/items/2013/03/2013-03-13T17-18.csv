Asking if it supports other browsers is like asking if the Linux kernel supports BSD, Windows and Darwin.<p>In other words, if you replace Gecko in Firefox OS, you are left with nothing of Firefox OS. Just the underlying Linux kernel basically. So technically this just makes no sense.<p>The situation is different on iOS, Android, etc. - web browsers are just another app there. Many browsers run on Android, and the only reason they do not run on iOS is <i>policy</i>, not <i>technical matters</i>.",1363197577

5369978,comment,5369105,5369484,2,0,usea,,,"Age of Empires 2 came out in 1999, developed by Ensemble Studios. Age of Empires Online was released in 2011, by Robot Entertainment and Gas Powered Games. A good portion of its code came from Age of Empires 2[1], including its terrible path finding[2]. Modern RTS games actually have pretty good path finding, and even Starcraft (1998) had better path finding than the legacy code used in AoE Online (2011). Microsoft published both games, and presumably they dictated the reuse of the old code.

A game hasn't captured my attention like this in quite a while.<p>And yet, many players seem to believe the game is completely unplayable. The top comment on this thread as I write this says that the game is a 'travesty' and shouldn't have been shipped. That's unreasonable.<p>I can only begin to imagine what SimCity's developers are feeling right now. They built this beautiful, different, rich product that is objectively amazing. And yet the players they wanted to please can't stop talking about how shit it is.<p>Usually I place the blame at the feet of the developers, but not this time.

    * How many concurrent clients are we talking about here?
    * Use of blocking sockets will require a separate thread for each connected client? Was Ruby not able to support many threads?
    * Non-Blocking sockets will require lesser number of threads. Note: I am from a Java background and Java's NIO scales well in handling volumes of concurrent sockets)<p>2. Handling volumes of data. (Data mining/aggregation) This is an IO/CPU intensive work load.
    * I dont think you would had done data-processing in ruby. Please correct me if I am wrong.
    * Scaling the ""periodic"" process to mine data can be efficiently done by choosing an appropriate storage system with efficient indexes. (MySQL/Postgres/Columnar-Storage/Cassandra etc etc)
    * Did you run a database? Did it run as a separate tier in a different server?<p>3. A queue/scheduling framework which would trigger the data-processing in periodic intervals(like google app-engine cron service)
    * How many ""cron-entries"" do you have in your system?<p>4. A CPU intensive algorithm which parses the incoming client's data before persisting in the database. 
    * The incoming data from the client may require CPU intensive processing. (Example: parsing the data, eliminating duplicates etc etc). Did the CPU
shoot up because of this?<p>Will be great if you can throw some light on the volume/scale of the processing involved.

If you weren't going to patent it anyway, there wasn't going to be a ""dueling applications"" situation, and ""first to file"" wasn't going to come into play anyway. And if you disclosed the technology instead of keeping it secret, then prior art comes into play and AIA expands the cases in which prior art can be used to invalidate a patent.<p>I'd personally like to see a merging of the ""prior user rights"" and ""prior art"" defenses. It should be possible to invalidate a patent by showing that <i>someone else</i> was using the technology before the patent was filed, even if that other person didn't publish.<p>Of course, one way to achieve that effect under current rules is to publish instead of keeping technology secret. If the tech community is really opposed to patents, especially software patents, then it should take additional measures to publish exactly how all their technologies work. This is something Google, etc, can take the lead on without waiting for legislation. Establish a rich database of prior art that can be used to invalidate future patents.",1363195716

This is, indeed, problematic at times.<p>> Not strictly boxing IO in the IO monad makes it easier to debug (debug by println is still useful!).<p>Well, Debug.Trace gets you most of what you want there (using unsafePerformIO under the covers), so there is an ""escape hatch"" for doing printf-style debugging.  But it's not quite as smooth as printf in languages that don't sandbox purity so much.  On balance, I'd still take the purity (because I do a lot less debugging!), but point granted.<p>> Macros are much easier to understand than Template Haskell<p>No experience with macros, but since lisp-like things are so big into macros, sounds plausible.<p>> and since you don't have real typing you can have heterogeneous collections, or values where the type of one part depends on the value of another part, easily.<p>I'm not sure I view this as a /virtue/, to be honest.  I'd rather have the type checking, and use typeclasses or ADTs to put mixed types into a sequence.<p>> Also I think it really is easier to get started with Clojure than with Haskell,<p>Yeah, I think this is undoubtedly true.  Haskell veterans often say ""whats' the big deal?"", but the deal is big.  And it's not so much because of ""math"", in the classical sense, as much as it's about very high, very new, abstractions.  Many of them without analogies to things you've done before or things in the ""real world"".

They're also really straightforward (for the most part).<p>So you know that Sass and Less allow you to nest rules, right? e.g.:<p><pre><code>    .foo {
        p {
            // rules go here

translates into .foo p { <i>rules go here</i> }<p>Here are the examples from the article:<p><pre><code>    &:hover { opacity: 1; }

The ampersand simply means 'I am applied in the context of whatever rule I happen to be in'. So, .home { &:hover { } } is equivalent to writing this normal CSS:<p><pre><code>    .home:hover {
    }
</code></pre>
@include is like #include in C. It literally <i>includes</i> the referenced content in the rules you're writing. That means that<p><pre><code>    .home {
        @include bg-size(60px,auto);
    }
</code></pre>
is including something that (inferring from the name, here) sets the background size for the element. Given the parameters, it probably expands into:<p><pre><code>    .home {
        background-size: 60px auto;
    }

So, I don't wonder the universities are the best at producing papers that are cited, I just wanted to emphasize that even in that area the industry has not bad contributions. There is also lots of innovation happening in the industry that is not published in the form of papers, since in many places there are no incentives to write up one after doing something of value.",1363194169

5369611,comment,5362265,5362806,1,0,VLM,,,"""never while it is being driven.""<p>One reason to own a scan tool is to debug anti-lock brake sensors by driving around and noticing which wheel always reports zero... then replace that one sensor.  This is far superior to random shotgun troubleshooting.  Also while I had a thermostat problem I drove around quite awhile with my scan tool watching the thermostat misregulate my cooling system which is what led to failed readiness indicators because the engine never warmed up all the way only 99% of the way, etc etc.  ODB-II is very old, like a college freshman, whereas this is a new iphone app.  The equivalent for android, a program called Torque, is old.  There are almost certainly HN posters younger than the standard ODB-II port.  I bought a bluetooth ODB-II reader for my android/torque phone probably two years ago?  It does apparently everything this new app does.  My now antique orange physical scan tool appliance that cost me about $150 is about ten years old and obsolete, although it does still work.  It is much tougher construction that my phone, which cost a lot more than $150...<p>One of the nicest Torque features is being able to reconfigure the gauge display.  No point in being distracted by the oil pressure gauge when you're driving around if all you care about is a graph of the coolant temp vs time or peak coolant temp or whatever it was.",1363194062
5369610,comment,5369105,5369105,4,0,dyselon,,,"> Clever, dedicated, and somewhat masochistic players have found ways to ""hack"" the poor pathfinding behavior.<p>To be fair, this was also the case with SimCity 4's ""always the shortest path, no matter how congested it is"" pathfinding, until fans fixed that part.<p>I actually found that part kind of fun! I do think that the cycle of gaining deeper understanding about how the simulation works, then redesigning your cities to work around it is pretty fun in a general sense. Really, the only problem with 2013 is that a) redesigning your city around 2013's pathfinding issues makes you end up with dumb, intersectionless cities, which feels ""cheap"", and b) even in the extreme case, there's only so much you can do about some of the pathfinding issues.<p>Last night, I had 3 school busses going to the same 2 stops over and over again, ignoring the rest of the city. No wonder my city's children are such little hoodlums.<p>[EDIT] I originally intended this to be a reply to potatolicious' post. Whoops.",1363194060

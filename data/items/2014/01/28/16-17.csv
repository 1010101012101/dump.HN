7138170,comment,7137378,7137875,3,0,aaronem,,,"If so, then one or the other has a long, long way to go. We&#x27;ve seen attempts to translate the movie experience into a videogame format, and they&#x27;ve failed abjectly every single time; there is a reason for this.<p>For a recent example of the state of the art in interactive movies, let&#x27;s look at &quot;Beyond: Two Souls&quot;, a PS3 game released last year by Quantic Dream, a studio lately specializing in the format; their 2010 release, &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;, was fairly well received. &quot;Beyond: Two Souls&quot; makes a halfway watchable B-movie (think &quot;Hit Girl&quot; meets &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; with a double shot of Evil Movie CIA), but as a game it is God-awful. This is because the need to maintain coherency, in a heavily pre-planned movie-style narrative, militates strongly against giving the player any kind of freedom to <i>play the game</i>; the result is a farrago of quick-time events (&quot;press X to not die&quot;), &quot;find the blue dot&quot; puzzles in which the game tries and fails to give an illusion of involvement by requiring the player to pixel-hunt in order to advance the narrative, and branch points at which the player gets to choose the next cutscene from a small collection of very similar alternatives. One need not be a &quot;hard-core gamer&quot;, whatever that is, to find this a combination which utterly fails to satisfy; then again, even today&#x27;s theater tickets don&#x27;t cost anywhere near $60 a pop, a high price even for a <i>good</i> movie -- which &quot;Beyond: Two Souls&quot; manifestly is not.<p>On the whole, this bodes ill for the future of &quot;interactive movies&quot;; a game and a movie are clear different things, and so far no one has come up with a means of reliably bridging the gap between them. Perhaps that will change as new technology such as the Oculus Rift offers new possibilities both to game developers and to filmmakers, but I tend to doubt it; what seems more likely to me is the genesis of an entirely new genre, possibly synthesizing traits from both movies and games, but fundamentally not the same as either.",1390928377

Let it be something non-mundane, but also not &#x27;epic&#x27;. I typically use acting as a bodyguard that is protecting their client. The scene occurs and depending on player&#x27;s actions, client lives/dies or any number of consequences (give it a Hitman feel with &#x27;multiple&#x27; solutions). &#x27;Slice of Life&#x27; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_of_life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_of_life</a>) plays and realism were the style in the 1800s, it could be possible to see this style emerge again through immersion.<p>The other idea is turn Oculus development more commercial-grade, training simulations because the real life material cost is too high. Instead of a cadaver, simulate the body for autopsy. It might even help ease some mind&#x27;s transitioning to a real body.<p>I think the article used the Oculus to really talk about immersion technology as a whole.

If Apple styles itself as a leading consumer tech brand, then it will be interesting to see how they counter Google.<p>And counter they must: at the moment, voice interaction is one-on-one, but with enough algorithms and corpus, independent agency will become possible.

Additionally, with a USB drive, the user can save data that will persist from computer to computer, which makes the idea more tolerant to the use of unreliable recycled computers.

That can be expensive, but you might be surprised how many recycled electronics simply end up in these developing countries. These costs might also be why the price of &quot;just a live USB drive&quot; is as high as $7.<p>3. Again, the USB drive itself probably won&#x27;t cost $7, so that supporting infrastructure might be included in that price.

The comment--specifically, the phrase &quot;you can get&quot;--evidences a reckless disregard for the possible consequences. Arguably, a break-in is a reasonably foreseeable consequence. One might even argue that the commenter <i>intended</i> to cause a break-in.<p>I suspect there could be multiple theories of liability here, with all or most being torts. Naturally, the available causes of action would be a function of whether anybody acted on the suggestion and broke into the house.<p>On the other hand, if you phrased it differently, you <i>might</i> be safe. For example, it seems grossly unjust to punish expression along the lines of: &quot;John Smith is internationally famous for the extensive Picasso collection in his home gallery.&quot; Almost any fact could conceivably be abused in the wrong hands. If a speaker were unconditionally liable for any subsequent abuse of his/her speech, regardless of the character or intent of the speech, nearly all factual speech would entail extremely burdensome legal risks.<p>So what determines whether a public comment about someone&#x27;s valuables is actionable? Again, context. What did you say about the valuables? (Did you suggest stealing them?) Where was the comment published? (Was it on a burglary forum?) What was said elsewhere in the same article or conversation? (Was it part of a discussion about how to become a better burglar?) These are not necessarily the only factors.

Overall, both ideas are good but usersnap is beating you in terms of landing page/design and most likely sales/marketing efforts. For example, on your landing page, there is no clear way of knowing what bugmuncher is for. Sure, I want to &quot;Fix bugs like a boss!&quot; but how ? Then I realize you have a small text description &quot;BugMuncher is the best way to receive feedback on your website. With BugMuncher annotated screenshots can easily be sent along with feedback reports, making it ideal for internal use, as well as getting feedback and bug reports from your users.&quot; Why not make this prominent ? Usersnap smartly says &quot;Screenshot is worth a thousand words&quot; and we know immediately what it is about.<p>I would not throw in the towel yet. Functionality wise, your demo video is pretty cool. Other than work on your landing page, you definitely need to go out and do sales/marketing.

What is known is that the ways that perspectives can change thanks to virtual reality are remarkable. Movies, as Roger Ebert said, are “like a machine that generates empathy.” If a person in a VR headset can experience a protagonist’s or antihero’s life first-hand, then the Rift actually becomes that machine. (The possibilities for documentaries seems particularly appealing; Oculus Rift is already being used by artists to “gender swap.”)</i><p>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s 2014 and a media writer...someone who, of all people, should understand the bespoke nature of content, is thinking along these lines. The same prediction was made back when DVDs came out, that the massive increase in storage allowed filmmakers freedom to show viewers alternate scenes and endings, to the point where the viewer could choose their own adventure.<p>Aside from DVD extras, which are often rough and unfinished, that new kind of moviemaking hasn&#x27;t happened yet, and not because of the limitation of the tech. First of all, DVD extras are often rough because it takes time and money to make them as excellent as the finished film. And even unreleased produced footage isn&#x27;t always a winner, as there was often a reason for that footage to be cut in the first place.<p>We don&#x27;t have user-interaction in movies because movies are a medium in which the creators have a distinct vision. Even if it were possible to design and produce a movie world in which users had the freedom to do what they want, it necessarily waters down the director/producer&#x27;s vision...<p>Hell, <i>books</i> have had the technology for &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; for a very long time (they&#x27;re called, &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; series&quot;...but such books have not become true classics. Would &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; be as fine a classic if readers/theatergoers were given the ability to choose a happier, non-tragic ending?<p>Oculus Rift is an awesome technology and will open frontiers that we don&#x27;t yet know exist...but it&#x27;s not going to fundamentally change the bespoke (and somewhat rigid) art of movies and literature, unless movies and literature themselves undergo a radical rethinking...but that kind of revolution is not waiting on technology.",1390925322

I&#x27;m not trying to argue that the methods used by recruiters are the best for candidates, but rather explain them in terms of the recruiter&#x27;s perspective and motivations.<p>Salary range - It matters when you have candidates who have a false sense of their own value. If I&#x27;m hiring an Android dev for a client and I know the salary goes up to 140K, what is the use of telling that number to the person 2 years out of school who is only worth 80K at this point? The reason salary ranges exist is that a company realizes they will get some variation of experience. We can call people &quot;Junior&quot; and &quot;Senior&quot; all day long, but it matters little when we get applicants of varying experience applying for the same job.<p>The salary range, particularly when talking about those least qualified for the job, often creates an inflated sense of value that translates into potentially losing a candidate who feels somehow snubbed because they didn&#x27;t get the max of the range. People aren&#x27;t realistic about their value in most cases, and the range just reinforces that issue.<p>Reason for hiring: I see your point about replacement candidates, but most don&#x27;t use job specs as a way to both screen in and potentially screen out candidates. I do like specs that screen out (if they want you to work 60 hours, I&#x27;d like that to be in the job spec).<p>Benefits: Again, we&#x27;re advertising what is different. We could potentially write every single detail of the benefits package, including what the plan is and how much your copay will be if you go to the podiatrist without a referral, or whether or not our HMO covers chiropractic. That might be a dealbreaker for the person with the bad back, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much to most people.<p>PTO is important to you, and to most - so that is something that is usually worth mentioning, but is only mentioned in most cases when it is above average. Most people will assume &#x27;average&#x27; when reading a job spec unless it is otherwise stated. You&#x27;ll assume 40 hours a week (probably), so if the company expects only 25 hours or if they expect 80 hours it is worth mentioning. If it&#x27;s 40, should I mention it?<p>The job post is to get you to apply to something you are qualified for and hopefully interested enough to want to learn more (as well as screen out those who are unqualified or would obviously not be interested due to a dealbreaker), and we&#x27;re not able to give every single point in it. Even if we did give every detail, you are still going to actually MEET the people, and you might not like them (or they might not like you). It&#x27;s how we start a conversation with an applicant, but it&#x27;s certainly not how we end it.",1390925156

In EVE, there&#x27;s a larger set of roles than the Tank/Healer/DPS holy trinity, and while some roles can be quite cash/skill intensive (like piloting capital ships), there are other important roles (like tackling) where you can have near-optimal gear and skills within a very short while.<p>There is no linear progression of ships in EVE PvP. You don&#x27;t need, or want, a capital ship for tackling. You want a small, fast, ship capable of literally flying circles around the big ships, fast enough that the big guns can&#x27;t really hit it. If you focus your skills on it, you can get to the point where you&#x27;re an effective tackler within a few weeks at most, and within a couple of months you&#x27;ll have a character that&#x27;s tackling with the best of them.

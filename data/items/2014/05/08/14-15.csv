7715623,comment,7714972,7715438,1,0,claudius,,,"> Crap laws should be ignored.<p>So who gets to decide which laws are “crap laws” and which laws are proper laws that should be obeyed? Last time I checked, this was usually <i>not</i> the job of some random startup firm but rather the responsibility of parliament. You can argue that <i>sometimes</i> it is appropriate to fight against specific laws by ignoring them if the cost of not doing so vastly outweights the cost of lowering the authority of the law. I don’t think taxi laws fall into that category – if the current laws required all drivers to be white, I could maybe understand fighting that law by disobedience, but otherwise?",1399561107

7715603,comment,7714400,7714961,10,0,dpierce9,,,"It is simply not true that multi-valued logics collapse into two-valued logics.<p>While it is true that you can assign indeterminate statements {true,false} and call it a third value, logic is more than assignments of truth-values to statements, it is also rules of inference for that formal system. The rules of inference are the driving force behind paraconsistent logics and the rules of inference are very different.<p>One motivation is the explosivity of contradictions in a formal system. Consider a paradox of humility: I believe of each of my individual beliefs that it is true, I believe all of the logical consequences of my beliefs because I am rational, but I can&#x27;t rule out the possibility that two of my beliefs (or their consequences) are contradictory.<p>Treating beliefs as statements, under classical logic, any contradictory beliefs would imply that you believe (or would assent to) anything and everything is true (and false). Here is how:<p>1. P & ~P (premise)\n...\n2. P (1 simplification)\n3. ~P (1 simplification)\n4. P or Anything (2, addition [i.e. the self-evident principal that if P is true, P or anything else is also true])\n5. Anything (4, 3 and the principle that if a or b is true and a is not true, then b must be true).<p>In other words, contradictory beliefs imply anything and everything is true (and false). This is an odd result especially since anyone with an ounce of humility will admit that there is a reasonably high chance that there is a contradiction in their beliefs or in the logical consequences of their beliefs.<p>Now for a &#x27;more practical&#x27; example. Imagine you have a key-value store that represents people and properties. Suppose your database says that Jane is 34 years old and later it says Jane is 35. If you ask the database for all of the logical consequences of this people/property store, under classical logic you will get every statement and its negation. Weird huh?",1399560937

In particular for me there&#x27;s a strong connection between using software to model the world and the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness, the notion that nothing exists in its own right: <a href=""https://suite.io/matthew-bingley/1z8s2kx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://suite.io/matthew-bingley/1z8s2kx</a><p>I started coding young, and over time I gradually came to see that any computational representation of the world was always false. The act of writing software was always an editing of the real world, a discarding of everything that wasn&#x27;t apparently material to my particular purpose. Changing software was sometimes a recognition of ignorance or fallibility, but often showed me how changing purpose changed what the maximally useful model was.<p>Years of that experience, combined with things like Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s work, made the apparent contradictions of Zen much easier for me to follow.<p>I think that also primed me to be ready for the Agile movement. Early on, I had strong BDUF tendencies. But once I gave up believing that there was <i>one</i> right model, <i>one</i> right design, I lost my taste for BDUF. So when people claimed we could keep our software as flexible as our understanding, that was very exciting for me.",1399558416

Within hours of arriving, my mom started receiving threats from neighbors.<p>&quot;Fuck off, leave our neighborhood in peace&quot;<p>&quot;Our children aren&#x27;t safe since a new group of strangers shows up every weekend&quot;<p>&quot;If you make so much as a peep of noise we hear after 10pm, we are calling the sherrif&quot;<p>etc...<p>My mom has thick skin, so this isn&#x27;t a cry for attention or sympathy for her sake.  In retrospect, I was sympathetic with the neighbors -- they had three small girls under the age of 10 and were afraid to let them play outside on the weekend with a house next door perpetually filled with strangers.<p>My question is if there is anything neighbors/neighborhoods can do to prevent a home owner from renting their house out 4 days a week?  If not, should there be?",1399557847

(Equally, salaries could be a small percentage of expenditure, but if the company makes only a small amount of net profit then tax on salaries could easily dwarf tax on the company&#x27;s profits.)",1399557847
7715295,comment,7708939,7711600,1,0,jofer,,,"There certainly is a big supply/demand imbalance, but undergrad geology enrollments are actually way up.  All geoscience departments I know have have dramatically increased in size in the past 10 years or so.  (e.g. where I went to undergrad has gone from 5 geo majors to ~60, and I&#x27;ve seen the same at the two places I went to grad school)<p>A lot of it is that a geoscience job at an oil company requires an M.S. or a Ph.D., and geology degrees typically take longer than most other fields.  There&#x27;s a minimum of a 6-year lag between starting undergrad and being eligible for a job.  Typically it&#x27;s more like 7-8 years total for an M.S. and 8-12 years for a Ph.D.<p>Therefore, it&#x27;s a long pipeline.  I just started in industry, and when I switched to geology in undergrad (early 00&#x27;s), oil companies were not hiring geologists and hadn&#x27;t been for 15 years.<p>The stigma associated with going into the oil industry depends a lot on where you are geographically. If you go to an &quot;oil patch&quot; school, then it&#x27;s the opposite effect.  It is a factor, but I&#x27;d argue the field vs. desk job part has a larger influence.<p>Geologists tend to become geologists because they _really_ like the outdoors. With a few exceptions, as a petroleum geologist, you&#x27;re behind a desk 100% of the time.  Compare that to fields like environmental consulting or state government work where you can start right out of undergrad and are in the field a significant portion of the time. (Both of those pay less and tend to involve less actual geology, though.)<p>Finally, there&#x27;s a risk/reward trade-off. Geologists tend to be among the first to go when layoffs start. We&#x27;re concentrated in exploration and development (note: field development, not software), and exploration is viewed as an expense, not a profit center.  Exploration budgets get slashed the second things look like they&#x27;re going to take a downturn, and smaller companies lay off most of their exploration geologists whenever oil prices drop.  Development is the second thing to cut back on after exploration. A lot of the folks that I got my M.S. with started jobs in &#x27;06 or &#x27;07 and were laid off in &#x27;08 or &#x27;09.  They&#x27;ve all since found jobs again, but the cycle will repeat itself.",1399557834

While we can maybe say that Buddhism came up with some similar-looking stuff, there&#x27;s no causal link, and the philosophical systems are not working within the same paradigm. Like seeing a human face on the surface of Mars, this is an example of coincidence more than any deep connection.<p>Well, OK, that&#x27;s unfair, because Buddhism and formal logic are both human endeavours, and have to deal with the same facts. But this disconnect is even true with parts of Greek philosophy. &quot;Atoms&quot; as we understand them are very different from &quot;atoms&quot; as Aristotle thought of them, even though there is a historical connection. Today&#x27;s chemists would do badly if they relied on Aristotle for anything other than historical curiosity.",1399557776

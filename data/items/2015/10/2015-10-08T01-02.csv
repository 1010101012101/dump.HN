I&#x27;m always excited to hear things like this, and I was very excited to hear that Jet was committing to F#. I&#x27;m not a fan of heavy enterprisey dev environments, but F# is a great language. How great it would be if more organizations came out strong for functional programming.<p>But I have heard some about the software hiring practices at Jet and what I&#x27;ve heard makes me highly skeptical that they could actually be using proper functional programming techniques. It&#x27;s disappointing -- someone using F# because it&#x27;s vaguely &quot;better C#&quot; -- similar to people using Scala or Clojure because it&#x27;s &quot;better Java&quot;.<p>Sometimes I think they heavy advertisements (&quot;Hey look we&#x27;re so cool we use functional programming&quot;) is more meant to sucker people in under the belief that once the business stabilizes, it will be some sort of Bell Labs of ____ where the company will really try to invest in high-end software solutions and research, and that a lot of it will be carried out with functional programming.<p>But the reality is that it&#x27;s more of just a hiring tactic and a tech status grab. Maybe you can convince people on the fringe of functional programming to accept less pay for the lure of getting to learn a functional language? Maybe it&#x27;s worth it if you get on-average higher quality developers because of the affinity for vague association with functional programming?<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible that they really do use F# and that the overall system has been architected well with functional principles. I don&#x27;t get that sense from the linked blog post or from the overall progress of their online services.",1444269504

Sitting in traffic and maintaining a car are negatives, but being able to travel whenever you need to and going directly to your destination are huge pluses. So public transport must be competitive with driving. It must win in convenience or value or both. In some places like Manhattan, driving is so painful that public transport usually wins out. But, in many cities driving is more convenient and sometimes even cheaper. Of course, comparing cost is not easy since roads and buses and rail are usually all funded by an amount of general tax revenue.",1444268644

The former makes shorter URLs while the latter gives you more to work with on the server side.<p>In DotNet, System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256Managed::ComputeHash() is a good start for making a hash. Then, of course Convert.ToBase64String() could be used to make the string, but be sure to replace the &#x27;+&#x27;, &#x27;/&#x27;, and &#x27;=&#x27; with different characters to make the string URL-friendly.<p>For a hash-based solution, there should be no need whatsoever to exceed 256 bits in cryptographic length, particularly since trying random URLs is a time-consuming activity. In fact, 64 bits may be sufficient in the real world. Even if someone could brute-force one hundred million combinations a second, it would still take on average ~389 million years to crack 64 bits. However, if the salt and algorithm are known to the attacker, it could become a dictionary attack, which is worlds easier. A good middle ground would be 128 bits, or 24 Base64 characters.<p>In the case of Google Docs, they are probably using PKI-encrypted binary data (such as perhaps an internal account ID) encoded in Base64, rather than merely a hash. This could make lookups and redirects more efficient (and less troublesome) to process, while making the URL less human-friendly.<p>Using SSL is recommended if at all possible -- to prevent playback attacks. Alternatively, playback attacks can be minimised by using a proper nonce and timeout. Furthermore, make sure you use a good random salt if using a hash and computing it from simple information such as the user&#x27;s login username.",1444267600

But many, many people who don&#x27;t deserve opportunities get them (inheritance, for example) and many, many people who <i>do</i> deserve them, don&#x27;t get them.

How efficient is our society at finding &quot;the best&quot;? I tend to believe that someone as ridiculously talented as, say, Elton John, will always emerge. But then you hear the story of how someone like Matthew McConaughey was discovered (director of Dazed and Confused found him in a bar at 2am and said come to the set tomorrow -- zero acting experience) and you want to slap yourself.<p>And if you get into the genetic and familial lotteries (how smart you are, how good looking you are, are you black?, etc), then you&#x27;ll just go completely crazy when you realize how unfair the world is.<p>In any case, from his answer, it looks like sama is a talented guy who put himself in the right position to succeed and is now an outlier on the normal curve.

Before you decide to move on, be absolutely sure that you communicate with your current employer. I&#x27;ve heard countless stories from Recruiters and Hiring Managers saying that if an developer had only told them that something was bothering them, the company could have changed to accommodate them (saving the developer from quitting, and saving the company lots of money in trying to find a replacement).<p>After you&#x27;ve communicated very clearly and kindly, see if things change. If they don&#x27;t change, leave. Give yourself tangible outcomes (example: If X doesn&#x27;t change by this date, I&#x27;m finding a new job) and stick to those.<p>All the best.",1444266429

You can put a javascript framework on your resume, but writing your own html, css and javascript comes across as carving your own canoe with a flint axe, and the &quot;minimum viable product&quot; for more and more sites involves more and more javascript by default.<p>No one even bothers try to optimize, or learning how to think outside the box that jQuery and frameworks put them into because it&#x27;s just assumed you can pile on as much javascript as you like it&#x27;ll just <i>work</i>, as if bandwidth and RAM are practically infinite. And for the most part, that point of view is correct... but eventually, the end users are going to notice that things are slower than they should be.",1444266413

A machine can be contrived to pass such a test case, while remaining a lousy parser compared to people.<p>The real problem is that the parser comes so swiftly to wrong conclusion and cheerfully presents it as a valid result.<p>It would look a lot better if it simply reported &quot;error: cannot parse that&quot;. (Better yet, with reasons: &quot;I cannot parse that because I get stuck on this specific ambiguity and it&#x27;s just too much for me.&quot;).<p>Also, what about the possibility of multiple results? Language is ambiguous. If something has two parses, it&#x27;s wrong to assert just one.<p>This thing has made no consideration whatsoever that even a single instance of &quot;buffalo&quot; in the sentence might conceivably be a verb, which flies in the face of almost any noun in English being verbable.",1444266273

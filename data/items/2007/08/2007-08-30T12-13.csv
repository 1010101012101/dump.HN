As for what I do, I had 2 jobs and left one lately. Now I am focus on my main one, as  a part of a mobile software  devel team ( I am not a coder, just a talker, but I sure know how to bring in deals ).  ",1188477507
48204,comment,48171,48171,0,0,damon,,,"I honestly tried to drop emacs in favor of TextMate for hacking scheme.  It has the buzz, a great philosophy with a really stand up developer hacking it, sexy integration with osx, subversion hooks, nice bundle system, file browser, intuitive shortcut keys, seemingly deep regex support, and on and on.  <p>The issues I ran into with TM for scheme were really fundamental.  While TM has both scheme and lisp bundles, they don't seem to handle code indentation nearly as well as emacs.  Proper scheme indentation was mostly a manual process.  <p>The REPL integration is also much better in emacs, in my opinion.  That proves to be a <i>huge</i> time saver.  REPL integration in TM amounted to opening up terminal.app in a separate process.<p>These two things - code indentation and repl support - were two things I couldn't look past.  They are the bread and butter of scheme hacking.  I would love to see TM improve in these areas.<p>If you're lisp hacking I think you'll be best served by slime/emacs.  That combination is the best environment I've found.<p><p>",1188477493

As such, it looks like this promising technology will be integrated into a proprietary application/technology published by Adobe. I think it would be interesting to have this technology in the HTML 5 spec. <img src=""image.png"" dynamicresize=""vertical|horizontal|both""/> This is, of course, assuming it could be done in-browser and doesn't take a ton of processing power to do. Have there been any attempts to include more innovative technologies, such as this, in a W3C recommendation for something as broad as HTML?",1188477069

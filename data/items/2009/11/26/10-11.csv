But it's insightful gems like this:<p><i>""... There's an interesting side-effect to this last kind of fight, the fight for good. When you're not doing it for your own ego, you can win just by convincing others to join your side. If you get enough people to fight for you, you can even win without anyone actually knowing it was you. ...""</i><p>that make reading the article worthwhile.",1259233181
962532,comment,961808,961907,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Google's old implementation of OpenID was within the standard but outside of the spirit. Google would provide a different URI for every website you visited. This makes some aspects of using OpenID less useful (such as federated account meta data and links). Google now offers the ability to have one single URI as a user's OpenID identifier, which puts them in line with every other major OpenID provider.",1259232953

The article is more of an overview of the stuff online most people aren't aware of.<p>It just seems unfair to dump private intranets along with projects like Freenet and Tor together with RBN botnets, under the ""dark web"" designation.",1259232783

Well... This is not a shining example of scientific conduct, but, as I said before, I am not too eager to blame them. Right now, they are in the middle of a very dangerous game.<p>And yes. Scumbags will play both sides. It's just that the ""global warming doesn't exist"" side has more money right now, so, most scumbags seem to line up on that side.",1259232317

962522,comment,961654,961893,0,0,10ren,,,"In Bob Shaw's book on science fiction writing, he said that when he has told the gist of a story to someone, it releases some of the need to tell the story, and so it's less likely to get written. Therefore, when he's bouncing ideas off someone, and he gets a really good idea, he won't say anything about it, in order to conserve its energy, so it can be channeled into the actual writing.",1259232160

That would include most normal web sites with passwords. Just because he called it ""dark"" does not imply that all of it is supposed to be criminal stuff.

962515,comment,962332,962332,0,0,spoondan,,,"The unadjusted data these people present do not account for the relocation of measurement sites. If a measurement site for an area were to be moved higher above sea level, we would expect its readings to be consistently lower than those recorded prior to its move. Since New Zealand's measurement sites have moved over the last 150 years, the use of these unadjusted data are a <i>complete distortion</i> of reality.<p>This is an inexcusable mistake. Not only do these people not know the first thing about the data they attempt to analyze, they have evidently never attempted to learn anything at all about the data.<p>It's also rather implausible that the NIWA is part of a global conspiracy to cook numbers but still provides free, open access to the raw data that reveal the whole nefarious plot to any fool who can plot a chart.",1259231312

9085403,comment,9080896,9085069,0,0,wz1000,,,"You misunderstand. IO is just as much a <i>purely functional</i> concept as the rest of the language. notPurelyFunctional is a <i>purely functional</i> function. &quot;notPurelyFunctional 5.0&quot; will behave the same way no matter what you do with it.<p><pre><code>    do\n    value1 <- notPurelyFunctional 5.0\n    value2 <- notPurelyFunctional 5.0\n    value1 == value2\n</code></pre>\nis just syntactic sugar for<p><pre><code>    notPurelyFunctional 5.0 >>= (\value1 -> (notPurelyFunctional 5.0 >>= (\value2 -> value1 == value2)))\n</code></pre>\nNote the nested lambdas in the above line.<p>You cannot be sure what value1 == value2 will evaluate to even if you assume all the functions (including notPurelyFunctional and (>>=)) are pure(which they are)<p>One way to make sense of this is to think of &#x27;IO a&#x27; as instructions for the computer to compute a value of type a. So you can think of your notPurelyFunctional function as taking a Double, and returning <i>instructions</i> for the computer to compute another Double. notPurelyFunctional 5.0 would then create a value with something like the following information.<p><pre><code>    let z(which will always be ()) be the result of printing the string &quot;Please enter a number: &quot;\n    let name be the result of reading a line from stdin\n    let y be name parsed as a Double\n    compute and return the value (5.0 + y)\n</code></pre>\nNotice that no matter when or how many times you call notPurelyFunctional with 5.0, the <i>instructions</i> generated will always be exactly the same. When you run your program, the value called main in your program will first be evalutated purely to produce these <i>instructions</i>, and only once these instructions have been (purely) generated will your program be run and these instructions be executed. Thus Haskells purity is preserved at every stage.<p>Note that this was a very crude way of dealing with how IO behaves and is only meant to be an aid for grasping the concept of IO.",1424523186

The UK recruitment industry you represent needs to be replaced with a number of short Bash scripts, so that people like you (yes, you) will lose their jobs and suffer. The sooner it will happen, the better for everyone.<p>I&#x27;m a Russian living in London and always mention Russian recruitment industry as an example of smoothly-functioning market with most inefficiencies resolved in a way you would expect in a modern economy. In short, agencies in Russia only deal with hiring top-level execs, equivalent to someone on £200K+ salary in the UK (i.e. less than 0.1% of the country&#x27;s labour force).<p>The rest is handled directly by companies directly through two of the largest websites -- job.ru and hh.ru (it actually feels weird to describe this on a forum that talks about disrupting something all the time!) The traffic on those websites is enormous, the number of applicants for any vacancy is much higher than any recruiter I used in the UK ever brought in.<p>It costs the company a fraction of recruiter costs; it shows the applicant the company name immediately so he or she can do their own due diligence without listening to things like &quot;top-tier investment bank&quot; that you and your colleagues have invented. It&#x27;s better for everyone. Compared to that, UK recruitment looks like car boot sale compared to eBay.<p>Best companies like Yandex normally also advertise on their websites with few questions dropped into a vacancy to filter out non-qualified people (see, for example <a href=""http://company.yandex.com/general_info/jobs/develop_cpp.xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://company.yandex.com/general_info/jobs/develop_cpp.xml</a>).<p>Now, please, tell me about the added value recruiters in the UK bring anyone.",1424521997

For us to be hugely successful we have to be a focused passion brand.  Starbucks, not 7-Eleven.  Southwest, not United.  HBO, not Dish.<p>Netflix is phasing out its DVD business over the next couple of years to focus on domestic and international streaming. International is where penetration is pretty low and they&#x27;re targeting 15-16% penetration of broadband households over five years from its current 3%.<p>In the last few quarters they&#x27;ve outperformed their own subscriber growth forecasts on the international side with country launches in France, Germany underway. The share price has jumped each time. Other markets they are likely to cover Italy, Spain, OZ & NZ. Massive markets like India, China, Russia and Japan really unlikely for the medium term at least with piracy, strong local incumbents and lower purchasing power.<p>It&#x27;s just made $270m in profits in December 2014, after 10 years of losses from IPO to 2012 and secured a $500m loan with $1.1 billion cash so it is only now becoming financially sustainable. I assume they are getting better at creating own original content and thought Marco Polo was pretty good, might be on my own there though. I think the future is bright though opening in each new country and having to license content in them way in advance means lots of upfront costs in unfamilar locations.

A good (human) personal assistant should know what I want <i>and</i> execute without involvement on my part, and that requires social cues that are difficult to encode as inputs to machine learning. Until we reach that point all we have is are speech-to-text engines with some services attached, which is not that useful imo.",1424520113

Most are still learning after years of experience.<p>Learning something new is generally difficult.  For example, a baby doesn&#x27;t just stand up and walk.  Most people don&#x27;t just get on a bike and pedal away the very first time.<p>If you would like some help from HN folks, perhaps you could tell us what language(s) you have tried, describe how you find learning to code difficult, what you have tried and what the results have been so far.  Doing so might elicit feedback that is in line with your experiences to date.",1424520021

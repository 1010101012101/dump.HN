One of these things is not like the other.<p>Most hiring decisions are made through the informal networks.  That has, historically, been one of the great benefits of going to a really good school, because you get to make weak ties with folks who will eventually probably be in a position to help you out (and vice versa).  Participation online is a <i>staggeringly</i> good way to make weak ties.<p>Meanwhile, the ""Send out a hundred resumes and then wait by the phone"" is jobseeking for the truly clueless (and, sadly relatedly, the entry level -- I swear, there should be a class on this at college).  It virtually guarantees that any company putting up a job will get a hundred resumes for it, most of them from people who have no capability to actually do the job.  Additionally, all the people who are poor candidates on day N will probably still need jobs on day N+1, and they'll probably still be sending resumes.  It doesn't take a genius to predict what this does to your applicant pool after iterating for a while.<p>I think if you're really good your jobseeking process is less likely to involve seeking out companies and more likely to involve saying ""I am available for work"" in a semi-public fashion, but that is another discussion altogether.",1266472326

Normally you'd think ""Oh, it's easy, just finish it up!"", but after the third of fourth time of doing the same thing, I just can't make myself do it.

332919,comment,332819,332892,0,0,halo,,,"I find your reply objectionable.<p>I believe you mischaracterised my argument or completely misjudged my tone. At no point did I suggest the original author's point-of-view was ""utterly ridiculous"", just that I found it frustrating and to try and emphatically explain the reasons why. There is a world of difference there.  The introductory comments about it being a ""controversial rant"" have been mischaracterised - the idea was to try and minimise any offence to the original author, that I knew it was slightly hijacking the thread, that it may be a fringe viewpoint and that the author would probably disagree with my point-of-view. At no point was I aiming for ""chest-beating"", nor do I believe that was the tone of the post, but I do apologise if it came across as such. I do believe, however, that had the roles been reversed that I would not be offended if someone put their arguments forward as I did to support their point of view.<p>I also quite obviously disagree that I'm a ""jerk"", and I firmly believe that my opinion still matters despite apparently being the ""wrong sex"" to be able to have one on this matter and that this sort of discussion is not and should not be out of bounds.",1224039301

We were building a class and had just a dizzying array of pieces to work with each year.  This, coupled with our need to have every group, region and interest under the sun represented inevitably led to exchanges like this one: ""This student seems smart relative to other (<i>insert minority group</i>).""  The choices made were hard and required us to reduce people to numbers, colors and legacies.  What an eye-opener.  I feel I've got a leg up on anyone when I apply for stuff from now on.",1224038100

Like I said, I was more surprised how it carried over towards the poorer end of the spectrum. I definitely didn't go to a top tier university (for the record: University of Dayton in Ohio). I went to a University that wanted to improve it's diversity rankings in US News.<p>As a middle class white kid, I actually got bit by affirmative action, but I'm 100% for what I perceive as the idea behind it (give everyone a damn chance!) and hold no grudges at all. The execution, in my mind has just been bad because it leads to reverse discrimination. Unfortunately, I'm not well read enough in the subject to propose a plan to fix it.

I also spent quite a while in the Harry Potter fandom, which is literally 99% female.<p>In neither situation did I ever feel marginalized, or excluded, or ignored.  Occasionally I felt like I was an object of curiosity, but I can deal with that.<p>It is a bit of a culture shock, and in both situations I was careful to observe first and talk later.  I saw some guys who entered fandom, immediately started acting like...men, and had a rather unwelcome reception as a result.  But that's social skills 101: being aware of existing culture and norms of a group.<p>That said, I don't have any problem with a group like this.  It's not really a sex issue: it's connecting experienced entrepreneurs with like-minded people, which is kinda the point of mentoring.  Arguably, PG started YCombinator because he wanted to mentor people like himself; I don't see any reason why a group of women should not be able to do the same thing.",1224037076

332895,comment,332815,332815,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"A cool idea.  One reason Y Combinator has so many good bets right now is because they've established procedures and a reputation that discourages PowerPoint cowboys from pitching them and makes it seem entirely natural for hard core nerds to pitch them.  Removing the ""gotta have an introduction, need to have been around the industry for a long time, need to have a bunch of graphs showing projected revenues of 80 bajillion dollars in 5.3 months"" vibe of meeting with a good investor (and First Round is that) might just bring out a fresh kind of founder that might not have been comfortable winding their way through the traditional channels.  It'll also bring out the PowerPoint cowboys, of course, because they love free coffee and want to sell you on their amazing new viral Web 3.0 travel wiki social network, but I'm sure they'll be easy to spot (at least, they're easy for me to spot at valley events, on the rare occasions I get out and about...there's always a lot of them to spot, particularly if the drinks are free).",1224036710

It became known as a friendly place for female engineers to work and that, in turn, attracted more female engineers.<p>But that's not my point. My point is, at that company, I would often go to engineering meetings (with five to seven other people) where I was the only man in attendance. And I can tell you without a doubt that it was hard to get my opinion heard and I felt isolated.<p>So, I completely agree with your argument.

That is, less qualified applicants in similar economic situations were admitted solely because of race.

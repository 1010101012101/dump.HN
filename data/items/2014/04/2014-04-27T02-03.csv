I began work on the project and a few weeks into the project the client created a milestone for $2500 and released the funds. My account was already -$1,000 as freelancer.com was charging 10% for their fee being I am on a free account. When the $2,500 was released, I requested a wire withdrawal and it went through the process on schedule, then it was supposedly sent on 4/22 but I still have not received it.<p>As the project progressed, the client created another milestone for $5,000 and released the funds immediately. I made a withdrawal request, freelancer.com locked the funds to send it, just like the first $1,500 wire. The next day I received an email telling me my account is now limited and they wanted me to submit a government issued ID and proof of residence, like a utility bill, before they would restore my account and send the wire. They said this would be resolved within 24-48 hours of submitting my documentation. I sent a scan of my New York state driver&#x27;s license and my electric bill. They rejected both of them.<p>I then submitted a bank statement and my New York state driver&#x27;s license. They accepted the bank statement as proof of residence, but rejected my driver&#x27;s license again.<p>It clearly states on their identity verification form that a driver&#x27;s license is an acceptable form of ID.<p>I am posting this because I am curious if anyone else has had this problem. I am currently getting the runaround, nothing but canned responses (if any) from their support and their facebook page.<p>At the very least, I want to warn NY residents that if they use freelancer.com, they can expect similar problems.",1398567348

Random people started conversations with me, including a coy girl on the shinkansen, even though her English was as good as my non-existant Japanese. I&#x27;m pretty sure it depends on how inviting you look for conversations. I mostly had a dumb smile on throughout my trip, so I guess they liked that.",1398564658
7653615,comment,7652925,7652925,6,0,jmzbond,,,"This is a really interesting perspective thanks for sharing. I don&#x27;t think anyone intended to create this shadow economy. The founders of AirBnB, TaskRabbit, Lyft, and the like did not create those services with the intention that people hustle full-time. More that it was a stopover to get some cash in an economy where you might need it and a place where cost of living is high. But I very much agree that this piece demonstrates perverse incentives. As someone else posted on here, it&#x27;s not right if people hustle to the extent of crashing with their friend&#x27;s parent&#x27;s cousins every day just so they can list their places on AirBnB.<p>The other point though, is that I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have decades of hustle anyways, because the point of many of these services is to catalyze a culture of sharing that we&#x27;ve lost. Once we gain it back, then Lyft, Uber, and the like (as one example) can shift from drivers that drive around looking for rides (which is hardly sharing so much as a homegrown taxi), into truly picking up people when convenient for their usual routes. Of course, this depends on these organizations not being swayed by perverse incentives themselves.<p>We&#x27;ll see!",1398564603

Those personal boundaries should definitely be respected if tested and the stranger does not want to talk.<p>I have seen times when those boundaries have been crossed (particularly when alcohol is involved). It is odd the author did not go into any detail about unwanted interaction, and only focused on extra interaction which supported her hypothesis, without warning for situations which may turn uncomfortable and worse off for the stranger.",1398564539

I&#x27;ve only once ever seen static type checking help find bugs in rarely-used code paths, and that was a single occurrence five years ago.<p>>And you&#x27;ve never seen three guides to &quot;learn basic Javascript syntax&quot; which contradict each other?<p>No, I haven&#x27;t. The only things I can think of off the top of my head that a JS newbie would find contradictory are semicolons and declaring arrays with [], both of which are used by the vast majority. I&#x27;ve only seen one codebase ever that used new Array(), and only a handful that didn&#x27;t use semicolons unless necessary.<p>>You can argue it both ways, as far as I am concerned. Javascript like any other language has issues, what exactly those issues are... depends greatly on what you use Javascript for.<p>Good point. Claiming Javascript is issue-free is as ridiculous as claiming that (to quote this guide) &quot;Javascript sucks&quot;.",1398564391

Seriously as you get older and interact with more and more people you see the choices and opportunities that lead them to the current space-time co-ordinates. And you get a little bit sad sometimes that folks who could have been great have become de-railed due to some addressable issue into crime, or poverty, or drug addiction.<p>It is hard to sit at a company working really hard to fill jobs and to listen to all the folks who are out of work but not qualified for your jobs. Its hard to listen to the stories of good, decent people who work hard and are certainly capable, unable to break the chains of poverty because they can't both get an education and stay off the streets. Its hard to listen to young people, now young adults, who suddenly realize that it wasn't learning they hated it was the school and now they are trying to make it as adults without a solid foundation.<p>KA is has three things going for it, the founder is passionate about the cause (so its not going to sell itself suddenly), the technological sub-pieces have finally come into existence across a critical mass, the availability of 'self funded' (which is to say folks who no longer have to work if they don't want to) individuals to volunteer efforts for it.<p>So being remembered for lifting some fraction of the world (no matter how small) out of poverty by providing educational opportunities, or being remembered as someone who worked at one of the companies that formed the Web as we know it. Easy choice.",1328810399

And he is obviously more interested in his pot right now. the best bet would be to start painting him mental images of what his life will look like 10 years down the road, and to consider the real levels of remorse and regret he may feel if he does not take a slightly more serious approach to life and his future.",1328810396

Here's the problem though: the (BIG) producers are using various means inaccessible to smaller ones to change laws. And not in small way. And not in a way that benefits consumers.<p>People who get uptight about independent artists having their works digitally copied probably don't realize that this is a good thing. It means they are popular, it means people desire them, it means there is a market just waiting for you. Maybe it is time for a live performance, a tour, a gig, an exhibition, etc.<p>People seem to be so obsessed with selling copies of our work that perhaps they are forgetting what it meant to be an artist before easy, direct, reasonably faithful, copying was even ""a thing"".<p>Digital art, like code, is too easily copied to be controlled. As a programmer, I've come to terms with this. That doesn't mean that I won't ever make money, it just means that I'd make less than if there was a DRM system for everything that criminalized all of my users (note: users, not customers). And I'm OK with this. Perhaps this not OK with everyone (from the RIAA to the self-important programmer/artist), but I see fighting ""pirates"" as counterproductive and a waste of resources.<p>I work as a programmer full time. I get paid to do in-house company development. We don't sell any software, we sell physical products. I get paid for my expertise and for my ability to fix issues immediately.<p>I work as an open sourcer whenever-time. My work is free. Not ""GPL"", not ""BSD"". Free. As in, go, take it. No copyright asserted. Public domain where exists. WTFPL. Companies can steal my work and make it their own. They can modify it and resell it if they choose. It's financial suicide, right?  It is, until you realize that programming is a skill that has to be paid for. Companies can steal and modify code IF AND ONLY IF they have someone to modify it. That means they are paying someone to modify the code. That means a programmer is still getting paid. The question is -- why can't that be me? Maybe I need to advertise myself as being the person you SHOULD hire instead of diverting company resources on acquiring an in-house person who is vaguely familiar with my code. What if they need a fix NOW, not 3 weeks from when I plan to release the next version for them to steal? They can escalate the priority with $$$. There are too many ways to monetize this.<p>This leaves me in an interesting position then. I'm the creator, and I'm getting paid for my services and my knowledge. I'm not getting ANYTHING for my product. Easy conclusion: if your only value is your product, and your product is free (or can, via Copy/Paste, be made free), then you are worthless.<p>If you're an artist, you have it even easier. Music will pretty much always sound better live, pictures of sculptures will never do them justice, a video of a play will never be the same as a live performance where you can see and smell the sweat, and seeing the paint on a framed, rough canvas will never be the same as 1000 DPI print.<p>In a way, this digital revolution has expanded art's ability to spread (unwillingly or not) but has also put a spotlight on novel ways of collecting payment for art and taken things back to a more traditional role. Like it or not, it is the result of the ability to digitize information. Make your peace with this system; anything else is just creating problems.",1328809032

3572021,comment,3571523,3571881,5,0,Wilduck,,,"I think this is miss-representing Buffett's position here. First off, he explicitly states that the riskiness of an asset should not be measured by its volatility:<p>> Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably certain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. And as we will see, a nonfluctuating asset can be laden with risk.<p>He goes on to describe what sorts of investments he thinks are worthwhile. Namely investments in assets that will continue to be productive in the long term.<p>> Investment in productive assets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability in inflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a minimum of new capital investment.<p>Again, this isn't framed in terms of risk.

Instead, it's framed as current versus future consumption.<p>As for gold, I don't think he frames it in terms of speculation versus investment at all.

When these giants come out with new technology it's terribly expensive at first(think plasma TV's 7+ years ago). Well, after a few years of production and a limited market, the lower-rung guys are able to catch up and get their share too(Vizio, Olevia, Sanyo) granted their products generally aren't as polished. The technology has evolved enough that others are able to produce it so everyone can afford it, while the big name guys still reign king because not only did they offer it at first, but their product is still superior. This same thing is happening right now. Tesla is the premium brand leader, and the other guys (Chevy, Ford, Nissan) are finally starting to get their act together.<p>The majority of people would rather have a Sony TV than a Vizio(assuming the picture quality is very similar) all because of that little Sony logo.

This back-and-forth between shipping code and the standards bodies has evolved as part of the process.<p>And contrary to your claim that prefixes are just applied blindly, some CSS features have indeed been implemented differently by different browsers  gradients and the flexible box model, to name just a couple. Prefixing is the only reliable way to get the feature before the W3C actually produces a standard with it 10-15 years down the road (I wish that was hyperbole, but it isn't  just look at how long they plugged away at XHTML 2 with no end in sight before everybody got tired of waiting and started implementing HTML5). The point of prefixes is to ensure that the W3C are never faced with a choice between standardizing a CSS feature against their will and breaking the Web.<p>Although I don't like the bloat from an ideological standpoint, in practice this is the best way we've come up with. But to make reading, writing and maintenance easier, I generally like using a CSS metalanguage with a library like SASS+Compass or Stylus+Nib. That way, you can just write, say, ""transition: color .5s linear"" and it'll get translated into the appropriate cross-browser code.",1328808311

Stocks do not beat gold once inflation outpaces the rate of average market returns, which is exactly where we're at now.<p>Gold is up 87 fold over 90 years or so. There is no way to capture that kind of return out of stocks, other than to buy one stock, Apple at the absolute bottom, or buy Dell the day it IPO'd or other similar freak scenarios, and then hold all the way through, and then sell at the absolute top. On a long term duration, it becomes increasingly difficult to survive even modest inflation and market changes (you have to constantly shift your investment strategies for all sorts of reasons: age, family, economic conditions, and so on). Few people are skilled enough to do that well.<p>With gold, you merely need to buy and hold - IF you believe the fiat currency will continue to depreciate due to 'printing' (to pay for entitlements, to devalue national debt, to fund deficits, and so on). There are very few things you could leave for your grandchildren that will retain their value, real estate and gold are two prime options.<p>If you had bought and held the stocks that make up the Dow over 60 or 70 years, you'd have gotten demolished because the Dow constantly shuffles its index. That is to say, you can't look at the Dow from 70 years ago and compare it to today, because the index is completely different, and the average investor could only easily purchase index ETFs in the last 30 or so years.<p>In reality, the Dow is not at 13,000 today as we knew 13k to be back in 1998/99 during the huge stock market bubble. Inflation has eroded that nominal value by at least half. The Dow is more likely at 5,000 to 6,500 depending on what you believe real inflation has been over the past 14 years (not the Fed's bogus CPI numbers).<p>The dollar has lost 97% of its value since the Fed came into existence. There's no way you can outrun that unless you hit homeruns in the stock market, which is what Buffett did, and which is exactly what your average investor cannot do regularly. The majority of people that invest in the stock market lose money. That's tracking since the late 1960s when the US went off the gold standard and inflation skyrocketed (sending oil, gold, and nearly everything radically higher).<p>Buffett hasn't made most of his wealth in the stock market anyway (nor that of Berkshire). He has made it by using insurance company float cash to purchase other high float companies, and then rolling that ball forward. Nearly all of his big market gains peg to one period of time, the 1970s, when stocks were once-in-a-generation cheap; his timing was brilliant, but it was an exceedingly rare scenario.",1328807862

This is still a significant competitive advantage for Webkit since there will be a lot of legacy content out there that uses only the -webkit prefixed name. This situation is an incentive for Webkit contributors Apple and Google to delay disclosure and standardization of these features as long as possible, and the W3C discussion above indicates they are doing just that.<p>> What you are proposing is to strip developers of the ability to test out non-standard features.<p>If it's only the developers we're inconveniencing, then sure let's have the W3C dictate that prefixed features are available in preview/beta/canary builds but disabled in builds intended for non-developer release. That would create some healthy pressure to get things standardized quickly, eh?<p>> If you want to only support standardized features then only support standardized features.<p>Once something is available to the public, developers <i>will</i> use it and often with good reason. That's where prefixes are most destructive. If Chrome comes out with a -webkit-sparkle property tomorrow, advocates of prefixes would have you add -moz-sparkle, -o-sparkle, -ms-sparkle, and plain old sparkle immediately just in case it becomes a standard.

I like it.<p>Whiteboard coding is good because interview questions are not about specific 100% solutions to complex real-world problems like programming usually is.  Interview questions are about general problems whose solutions will fit nicely onto a whiteboard.  You lose the ability to get realtime syntax highlighting, but you gain the ability to have multiple trains of thought, the ability to draw diagrams and arbitrary symbols, and the ability to point at things as you explain your thoughts to the interviewer.  Do you really enjoy it when someone comes over to your laptop to ask you a question about code?  Now imagine that for four hours in a row.  That's what a laptop interview would be like.<p>When I was interviewing at Google, someone asked me a question that required me to remember some math.  I did not remember it, but I knew how to derive the answer I needed.  So I went to another whiteboard, talked my way through the sub-problem while drawing some math symbols, and then transferred the answer back to the original problem, halfway completed on a different whiteboard.  Try doing that while hunched over your laptop.<p>I agree that this process is nothing like the job you're interviewing for.  That's because it's an interview, not the job.  We try to get a picture of who you are and what you know in a few hours, and that's just not enough time to let you loose with a laptop to see how you approach real-world problems.  Not to mention, real world problems don't often involve much ""computer science"" knowledge.  But you still need to know that so you can confidently attack problems that venture into that area.<p>And largely, the process works.  There are very few programmers at Google that can't program.  If I have an idea, I can explain it to pretty much anyone, and get good feedback.  At other jobs I've had, I've had to explain thing like arrays to coworkers.   That means I'm not going to get any feedback on my complex idea, and that sucks.  Google is not like that, because we filter those people out at the interview.",1328807274

We want money so that we have the fluidity of choosing a candy bar one day and a vacation another. Besides, you can't have someone offer you fractions of a vacation for your work. Is it truly that difficult to see where barter systems fail?<p>Besides, you are putting too much faith in the ""fair value"" idea. First off, when you want something and you barter with someone, a common technique is to disparage the quality of the item you desire. Why? To convince someone else that it isn't worth as much, that a ""fair value"" is less than that. Then, take the example of a mom-and-pop shop making jams and jellies. They probably have a lot of pride in their work and the price reflects their feelings of craftsmanship. They say, ""Look at how good it is! How fresh, how pure!"" -- they are trying to convince you that it is worth more than you initially appraised it at.<p>It's a conflict of interest -- it is in the best interest of the consumer to pay as low as he can, and it is in the best interest of the producer to get as much as he can. One seeks to minimize losses, the other, maximize profits.<p>Ever heard of donation-based bagel shops? You pay ""what you think it is worth"". Some people drop $5, others drop $0.01 because they want food and don't really want to pay for it. Even being glared at (social pressure) isn't enough to stop them.<p>The moral of the story is that people suck and asking them to ""be fair"" is a hilariously misguided way of getting revenue.<p>""When you put something on the free market, you are opening it to opinion and other people deciding the value. Think carefully first.""<p>Yes, they can decide on a value, and so can the producer. If the values match or can be negotiated, you have an exchange. If they don't, then there is no exchange.

It's a good indicator of how much you know for simple problems.</i><p>A few weeks ago I started helping a friend with a particular language and framework. He claimed to know it, having read several books on it. So I said great, go to the board and write a function that adds two numbers together. And he couldn't do it. Who knows, maybe he could have done it on a computer? Maybe he would have Google'd it quickly, or relied on code autocompletion, or the muscle memory from his fingers typing it, etc. But that's not what I wanted to know. Anyone who's written thousands of functions in a particular language could write a simple one like this on a wall, using paint, while hanging upside down. His inability to do so told me: he is not well-versed in this language. PERIOD.<p><i>2. You can practice.</i><p>""So what"", you protest. ""Google isn't going to ask simple problems.

1571066,comment,1570811,1570811,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I haven’t read all the papers put up on Wikileaks so I don’t feel comfortable making a judgment there.  But as someone who grew up in a military family I’d like to take a second to defend the harshness of the justice system in the Military (since part of this article’s point is how barbaric the military punishment for treason seems)<p> 
The thing you have to understand about Military Justice is that it has to be harsh.  These are guys whose job it is to take guns and kill people with them.  Which is why, as a society, we very specifically outline their chain of command and that chain of command ends at the one person in the country that must be elected by the majority of people in the country.  Because the right to legally order that another person be killed is so solemn that we only dare give it to the President himself (who then decides who he wants to put his trust in as far as chain of command).<p> 
As such you have to understand the highest value in a soldier’s life must be “to follow orders”.  Because if that soldier substitutes his own judgment for that of his commander than our whole society falls apart (this is how we get military coups).  Which is why we force soldiers to sign over their life to the military for their term of duty and why we take away many of their rights as citizens.  You, as a private citizen, can tell off your boss without any fear of legal repercussions but a soldier will go to jail for the same act because the highest military value is “obey your commander”.
 
 
So while I understand Military Justice might look harsh to civilians you have to understand that it’s absolutely necessary.  The guys with guns who have the legal right to kill people have to be held to the highest standard possible.  As do the paper pushers who deal with confidential data since they too can cause a person’s death through their actions.<p>(Just to head off one criticism right up front some will say this could lead to a corrupt Military.  To those people I’d point out that a soldier can say anything he or she wants about their time in the service AFTER they leave the military)

For instance, you can run a contest of skill (which this is) in Canada, but you have to exclude Quebec. Also, the laws are always changing. For instance, we used to have to exclude Puerto Rico, but it's now okay to include them.<p>To do a worldwide contest, you'd need to have a lawyer who knows the local rules in every country in which you want to operate.

1570991,comment,1567412,1569026,0,0,Xurinos,,,"This post is actually wrong on many accounts.  For example, you'll find that M-Z followed by C-s is followed by immediate disappointment.  It also does not save the macro or even do what the vim macro does (going to the beginning of the next line before starting the macro), which would cause it to fail catastrophically.  The real sequence (based on this one) is this:<p><pre><code>    C-x (
    M-z ""
    C-s (
    C-b
    C-b
    C-k
    Home
    Down
    C-x )
    C-u 50 C-x e
</code></pre>
I did two ""C-b""s.  I did that as more of a way to get out of the search mode quickly and lead into the next move.  The first C-b could be an enter.  The second C-b could be a left arrow, saving a keystroke but taking you off the main keyboard; however, I thought it would be nice to hold down the ctrl the whole time and just double-tap the b, so I will be keeping that in mind for keystroke count.  Not that this is a problem in emacs... after all, you are having to hold down ctrl or meta throughout most of the process here, so you have to make stretches.<p>If we count holding down the ctrl and meta keys as characters/keystrokes (and we also need to count the shift key), we have a total of 29 keystrokes.<p>I would not personally use the C-u combo, though, for numbers.  I just held down Meta.  That reduces your keystrokes to 28.<p>And it is 27 if you use enter and left arrow instead of C-b C-b... the fingering is more awkward and arguably slower, but it will work (as opposed to the other NOT working) if you are not in highlight search mode.<p>I gave all the shortcuts I knew about (not retyping ctrl in silly places, etc), but all those shift keys and finger switches add up.<p>With vim, you will find that you do a lot less of this song and dance with modifiers.<p>His improved/correct vim macro, btw, is qqdf""t(Dj0q50@q which has a total count of 18, counting smart use of the shift key.  The finger stretches are a lot shorter and the feel more natural.  Try both combos as listed (I am using a 28 keystroker for feel), and you should see what I mean.<p><pre><code>    qqdf""t(Dj0q50@q
    C-x ( M-z "" C-s ( C-b C-b C-k Home Down C-x ) M-5 M-0 C-x e

</code></pre>
In other words, there is additional value over just number of keystrokes.<p>Note... if 50 was the wrong guess at the number of lines, he does not have to type @q or @0 again to recall the last macro used.  He can just type @@.  This makes life much easier in an uncertain wall of text.<p>Edit: Parbo's suggestion of using function keys (which looks like only one macro can be used at a time) brings the emacs count down a little at the expense of flying to the top of your keyboard: -6 keystrokes, leaving us with about 22.  Try that for feel as well:<p><pre><code>    qqdf""t(Dj0q50@q
    F3 M-z "" C-s ( C-b C-b C-k Home Down F4 M-5 M-0 C-x e</code></pre>",1280841699

I've never seen poll/epoll as a bottleneck, but I'm using Java NIO which really seems to work extremely well (I don't remember how/which it uses, I think epoll).<p>Maybe Java does some of this cool stuff already so <i>perhaps</i> I'm shielded from the pain of dealing with things directly.<p>In the past I've written Java NIO code that dealt with around 60,000 concurrent connections pretty well. The time spent doing poll seemed to be completely insignificant. CPU usage was negligible.<p>It'd be good to see some numbers though - for example:<p>For average mongrel application, 40% of CPU time is spent in poll / average of 30ms latency is due to poll etc.<p>But I'm skeptical those numbers are true. That was my point.<p>If you don't start with those numbers and measurements, optimizations like this, whilst interesting, may end up being of no real use to anyone.",1280841354

More so than some decisions that I make! Yes, there's a fixed time budget. But you're suggesting selectively ignoring evidence when designing a program, preferring random guessing and pattern matching to actual numbers. Should he have collected them to begin with? Maybe not, but sometimes you can't help your curiosity on a hobby project :). I understand your concern about this hypothetical production system, but the fact of the matter is that there is no production system right now, and no way to measure how it will handle certain things, but there are benchmark numbers.

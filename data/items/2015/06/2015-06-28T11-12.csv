9793155,comment,9789819,9793051,0,0,e12e,,,"No, the <i>paranoid</i> assumption is that everything is backdoored. The <i>reasonable</i> assumption is that everything is flawed, and that for some of those flaws, certain groups have exploits.<p>It&#x27;s bordering on crazy to assume that Microsoft has backdoored all of windows on the behest of the shadow intelligence monster ruling our world from behind the curtain.<p>While some have found many of the NSA revelations shocking, there&#x27;s really been only a handful of new things: audacity, and a surprising (but small) violation of the NSA mission (to keep USA safe).<p>The former comes down to crudely monitoring elected officials from allied countries, the second the assumption that NSA <i>might</i> have intentionally weakened crypto (and by so doing hurt the US, and the US Military, US companies). Many veterans from the cryptowars of the 90s were surprised by that.<p>Now, just because a spy agency is good at its job, doesn&#x27;t mean that no-one else is. I have little love for MS, Intel, AMD (actually I do love AMD. Who doesn&#x27;t love an underdog? ;-) -- but I very much doubt they are complicit in some kind of grand Clipper chip scheme. They all want to sell to both the US, Chinese and Russian military, for one -- you can&#x27;t do that if the equipment/software is useless.<p>Now, Siemens (and perhaps MS) might have helped the US with the operation against Iran. That&#x27;s nice and patriotic, and probably paid well (if not in money, with contacts, further government contracts etc). That doesn&#x27;t mean Siemens intentionally sabotaged the development of the stuff they sold Iran -- it just means Siemens is as incompetent and rushed as the rest of the tech industry. It&#x27;s not quite the same as being malicious. Well, not the same as doing &quot;malicious engineering/product development&quot;.<p>Did the US Navy sabotage Tor? Unlikely. If they did, it was masterful subterfuge. If the &quot;great conspiracy&quot; can&#x27;t get it&#x27;s act together in sabotaging the armoured humvee&#x27;s they&#x27;ve left to an <i>actual</i> enemy [1,2] -- do we really think they manage to organize around the long game of deploying secure, hidden backdoors in windows, years ahead of their use?<p>No, I don&#x27;t think windows have hidden backdoors. It might have more security holes than a swiss cheese, and I generally run GNU/Debian anyway.<p>I&#x27;m open to being completely wrong though. Show me that a typical mainboard+ram+cpu combination is open to a hidden, intentional (even if masqueraded as accidental) backdoor, and I stand corrected.<p>In the mean time, lets just try and make stuff that works half-way the way we intend it to, and that includes the whole system. In this particular case, it means that we throw out CAs that we have no reason to trust (that reason being a) we don&#x27;t <i>need</i> them, they don&#x27;t <i>currently</i> certify anything we need to trust b) They&#x27;re incompetent, c) they&#x27;re hostile (eg: foreign government front/owned) -- and we reduce our attack surface.<p>Add a meaningful capability system &quot;NORID can only sign .no-domains&quot;, pinning and some other stuff to reduce the scope of CA power (now everyone is critical, because if someone has any <i>one</i> key, they can mitm <i>everything</i>. That&#x27;s just nuts).<p>Basically, I think the NSA is mostly a bunch of useless muppets, and I don&#x27;t see why we should keep making their job easy. Especially as I&#x27;m in Norway, and so, while <i>technically</i> in an allied state, we&#x27;ve seen that that means fuck all. I&#x27;m not part of the scandal in the US, I&#x27;m not a US citizen. It&#x27;s part of the above-board, initial brief of the NSA that they&#x27;re right to try and steal all my data. And that hasn&#x27;t changed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lobelog.com/down-the-iraqi-rabbit-hole-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lobelog.com/down-the-iraqi-rabbit-hole-again/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-turning-us-humvees-into-iraqs-nightmare-2015-6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-turning-us-humvees-into-...</a>",1435491939

I like the opinionated, batteries included approach of Django a lot. My major gripe with it is that it only takes you so far. There&#x27;s a ton of ever expanding documentation out there how to make your first app. Whether it&#x27;s the official tutorial, another one or a workshop. But when looking to build something less trivial—not just bigger, but more complicated—I don&#x27;t know where to look for in-depth guidance. Compared to Rails there really aren&#x27;t too many books out there. I should give an honorable mention of Two Scoops of Django, but the style of many loose bits of good advice still doesn&#x27;t help me with the bigger picture. Getting Started with Django made me hopeful, but somehow it never got past the first few episodes which again cover just the basics. Where to go after that? Just asking questions doesn&#x27;t cut it. If the question is too broad, you&#x27;re referred to the documentation, or the answer is too broad as well. And asking a specific, answerable question is hard when you&#x27;re not comfortable with the technology yet. Either way, it takes too long to ask all the questions that arise and wait for the variety of answers that might follow, compared to reading a book with well-worked examples or so that form a coherent whole. I&#x27;m starting to feel that the only way to get fluent in Django would be to get a job in an experienced Django shop, which IMO should not be the case. On IRC in particular I sense an off-putting attitude that &quot;we experienced Django developers know how to do it right&quot; without really making that knowledge accessible to others. The documentation isn&#x27;t by far as opinionated as the framework itself. As a result, I end up trying things that in the end can&#x27;t be made to work well.<p>TLDR; I would like Django to be more accessible not just to beginners but especially to advanced starters.",1435491597

There have already been two Singaporean Indian presidents (Devan Nair and S. R. Nathan, the latter the longest-serving in Singaporean history).<p>It&#x27;s hard to find a parallel with any Western country, because no Western country has as free an immigration policy for low income workers as Singapore does (the US has a large illegal immigrant population to meet demand, but the dynamics of that are very different) - around 12% of residents are on Work Permits (i.e. construction workers or domestic help) [1].<p>The Straits Time did not publish the event as a race-motivated riot because it wasn&#x27;t - it was more about a bunch of drunk angry people burning a few cars - and that it wasn&#x27;t was immediately obvious to the readers of the Straits Time (which include many non-Singaporeans; not to mention the ST has had its own feuds with the Singaporean government).<p>[1] <a href=""http://population.sg/resources/population-composition/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://population.sg/resources/population-composition/</a>",1435490531

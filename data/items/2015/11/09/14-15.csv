Rape is used in uncivilized societies or parts of societies as punishment (by village elders), it is used by brutal violent and primitives countries as a condoned acceptable spoil of war that commanders would turn their eyes away from, or just build a comfortable quarters for it and supply a steady stream of victims (like Japanese did during WWII in China), it increases fear and makes it easier to control people (just like torture) and so on.<p>What would you think of a society that does it and then also starts discussion the merits of that in a scientific journal.<p>Instead of treating like a topic for lunatics and crazy people we are treating it like we are discussing the results of a chemical reaction, that is what I am talking about, sane people finding excuses and studying torture as a valid topic.",1447081174

I mean, I can&#x27;t stop you from defining engineering to include software, but there is a critical difference in the actual <i>activity</i> performed by engineers vs programmers.<p>Programming is cheap enough that (even for these hardcore &quot;infrastructure&quot; tasks) the cost of planning something is roughly equal to the cost of simply building it. In fact, to a large degree, the activity of planning is identical with the activity of building. So the optimal approach is always going to be to plan/build, then test.<p>Programmers spend their day alternately planning and building, in an interleaved way.<p>Engineering is characterized by problems for which the planning is many orders of magnitude cheaper than the implementation. So &quot;getting it right&quot; and doing all the math in a very rigorous way up front is much much more important.<p>Engineers spend their time exclusively planning and double-checking their work. Somebody else does the building.",1447081160
10533329,comment,10526443,10533018,0,0,padobson,,,"The novel parallel is a great one. Novels, like games, are not passive art or entertainment. The reader has to keep turning the page, moving left-to-right through the world the author has created.<p>I can certainly agree with you that writing can have a meaningful impact on a game, but it&#x27;s not the reason a game becomes art, as this Polygon piece would have us believe about StarCraft. StarCraft is absolutely an example of how interaction is the core of the experience, and writing only helps construct a narrative to draw you into the experience, providing a cohesive metaphor to describe the experience - both during and afterward.<p>Like Mario saving the Princess or Donkey Kong collecting his bananas or Terran defeating the Zerg, whatever goal the game designer creates to propel you into the narrative is orthogonal to what ultimately makes the experience meaningful. The first Goomba in Super Mario Brothers is far more important to the experience than the Princess at the end of the game. Hell, the first question mark block is even more meaningful than that.<p>But you&#x27;re right, that without the eyes on the Goomba or the question mark on the block or Mario raising a flag at the end of the level, there&#x27;s no narrative to be drawn into, there&#x27;s no way to describe what you&#x27;re experiencing.<p>And you put it so perfectly:\n<i>But that isn&#x27;t what we are thinking about as we get immersed in a game experience - we soon forget that the controls are there.</i><p>In a great novel, the words fade away and the book disappears and all that remains is the dream world the author has written for you.<p>A game does almost exactly the same thing, but through action and feedback. The feedback can be text, voice over, artwork, animation, or any of the thousands of possibilities digital multimedia has opened up for us, but it should never try to be meaningful unto itself. This is where game designers get bogged down in trying to be like other mediums. Feedback is about rewarding the gamer&#x27;s action and pushing into the next action, looking for greater reward. A mushroom comes out the question block, the old man gives you a sword, your wave of zerglings wash over a gas refinery.<p>You might argue that writing is key to creating this experience, and I won&#x27;t disagree, but the Polygon piece absolutely fails to illustrate this, and so another wave of English majors says to themselves, &quot;Well, if I can&#x27;t get my novel published, there&#x27;s always video games&quot;",1447081158

It was a homework problem in college, and one of the few that stuck with me over the years.<p>The implication of a DFA for divisibility by 7 is that it&#x27;s easy (with practice) to figure divisibility by 7 in your head for arbitrarily long numbers as fast as someone can say them. Nice party trick! ;)  I&#x27;ve also been having debates with people about whether divisibility testing in your head is a simpler operation than long division in your head. When you break it down carefully, long division in your head for a single digit divisor is very similar, and also surprisingly easy to do, the main difference might be simply having to remember quotient digits, and nothing more.<p>I&#x27;m curious where the DFA for divisibility by 7 might have originally come from, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a homework problem in the text I used, &quot;Elements of the theory of Computation&quot; by Lewis and Papdimitriou, Prentice Hall, 1981.",1447080933

But maybe if you reflected on your ambivalence towards work-life balance, you&#x27;d find the kernels for personal growth in there. Let me explain myself.<p>Speaking in general terms, there is a psychological phenomenon called the double-bind. It happens when a parent or authority figure states some expectation verbally but then subtly undermine it with his/her actions. i.e. I can chastise my kids for spending &quot;too much time in front of screens&quot;, but then never have time to take them to play outdoors, or come back home and either keep working or root myself in front of TV, or buy them a video-game to reward some special achievement.<p>The root cause of the problem in this case would be my own unresolved feelings towards electronic entertainment, which I enjoy a little too much and I am aware to be not quite healthy. But from the point of view of my children&#x27;s psyche, the situation is much more destructive: each of them can either embrace the label of &quot;coach potato&quot;, absorb all the guilt from my chastising, but keep enjoying screens as a hidden pleasure; or they can try to live up to the impossible ideals I&#x27;ve set up for them and embrace the label of &quot;troublemaker&quot;, because enjoying some healthy outdoors activity inside the house will invariably end up causing a bunch of disruption, nuisance and the occasional accident.<p>What they cannot ever dare is to say: &quot;Hey Dad, you always say we should play more outdoors. Turn that gadget off and take us to the park&quot;, because if they do I will burst in anger. We all face some of this while growing up, and most of us learn to turn a blind eye to some intractable problems. In the most pathological cases, though, the children can grow up with a shattered sense of reality and develop serious psychiatric problems when they face the correct triggers in their adult lives (I have read, though I have not the reference now, that the double bind was fist discovered by the military while investigating the clinic histories of veterans who had gone into full-fledged schizophrenia instead of the more common PTSD).<p>What I am trying to say while I have read about this phenomenon from the point of view of development psychology, I have observed the same patterns of interaction in the workplace a few times. In those cases, we are all adults, so there is probably no risk of anyone&#x27;s mental health; but lot&#x27;s of needless stress comes from the unspeakable hot buttons, the packs of elephants that dwell in corporate rooms all over the world.",1447080024

The author had the chance to interview folks on both sides of the conflict.<p>The Russians were very, very good at establishing relationships with easily-influenced folks in the west, then using them to sway public opinion. Some were paid off, some were &quot;useful idiots&quot;. I&#x27;m only guessing, but from what I&#x27;ve seen online in the last decade or so it looks like they&#x27;ve wholeheartedly taken those skills and applied them to internet trolling.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not alone. The internet has become just another battleground for nation-states. It would be very interesting to learn how much money is being spent on this kinda stuff worldwide.

And, as a former competitive gamer, I can attest to the addictive nature of gaming that causes your heart to race and one&#x27;s palms to sweat while trying to clinch a victory.<p>For this, I believe you can&#x27;t say stories don&#x27;t matter.

At this moment in history, the growth of computer power has made a bunch of important signal-processing and statistical tasks <i>just</i> feasible, so we are seeing things like self-driving cars, superhuman image recognition, and so on.  But it&#x27;s been very difficult to take advantage of the available computational power, because it&#x27;s in the form of GPUs and clusters.  TensorFlow is a library designed to make it easy to do exactly these things, and to scale them with your available computing power, along with libraries of the latest tricks in neural networks, machine learning (which is pretty close to &quot;statistics&quot;).<p>As a bonus, it has built-in automatic differentiation so that you can run gradient descent on any algorithm — which means that you can just write a program to evaluate the goodness of a solution and efficiently iterate it to a local maximum.  If you do this enough times, hopefully you&#x27;ll find a global maximum.  There are a variety of other numerical optimization algorithms, but gradient descent is very simple and broadly applicable.<p>And it runs in IPython (now Jupyter), which is a really amazingly powerful way to do exploratory software development.  If you haven&#x27;t tried Jupyter/IPython, google up a screencast and take a look.<p>I&#x27;m just repeating the stuff that&#x27;s on the home page in a different form, but this is a <i>really big deal</i>.  Most of the most significant software of the next five or ten years is going to be built in TensorFlow or something like it.

From saber-rattling, proxy wars to propaganda campaigns, few will dispute that there has been a back-slide in recent years.<p>But here is what I find amazing: we have already seen this movie and we know what forces are at play and what the likely outcome is. Namely, it is very difficult to maintain legitimacy as a government through a propaganda campaign. It is a highly unstable equilibrium. At any time, information can get out of the hands of the propagandists and the system will find a more stable equilibrium -- ie. leaders will be replaced. It&#x27;s just a matter of time.<p>Right now the Kremlin is likely undergoing an intense debate on how to spin the downing of the recent Russian flight as something other than a reaction to the Russian air war in Syria. This is a heavy lift. Maybe they will succeed in this and maybe not. If so, they will have found a temporary reprieve but will no doubt find themselves encountering a similar issue in the future. The legitimacy of the Russian leadership will continually find itself teetering so long as it relies on propagandists to hold back a flood of disapproval.<p>Compare this system to the inherent stability of responsive governments with rule of law: healthy democracies (ie. Western democracy), responsive authoritarian systems (Singapore, China). Both these systems have release valves. In the case of democracies, elections reassert legitimacy with election cycles. In the case of responsive authoritarian systems, the government relies on surveys and technocratic leadership.<p>Russia has neither method of achieving stable equilibrium and so the propaganda will serve as a shaky dike holding back an ever growing force.",1447078931

In my experience, MOBA&#x27;s are winning because controlling one unit doesn&#x27;t give you the same stress level that comes with controlling an army, setting control groups, preventing supply caps, scouting, considering what you need to build next to counter your opponent, and taking steps to stop every cheese strategy that your opponent might try.  Even if you&#x27;ve executed at a high level, you can still lose in the blink of an eye if you fail to react.  I stopped SC2 because it left me with an uneasy feeling once I got near the top.  LoL, on the other hand, barely requires the kind of APM that SC2 does at a high level.  It&#x27;s more about knowing the correct items to build and when you can win a fight.

Remember that scene from Monty Python -- What have the Romans done for us? A lot of good has come out of colonialism&quot;, I was almost certain (almost) it was trolling. Once I saw others agreeing, I reconsidered. What you may consider trolling, may be the other idiot&#x27;s actual views.<p>I bring this often on HN, and I will do so again: such trolls (and people who actually believe what they say) are really really threatening to the internet, and everything it has mostly stood up for. When every woman is threatened with rape and murder, and every person of minority is humiliated (often under the pretension of 1) irony, as in reddit, and 2) strictly unemotional data-based Vulcan objectivity (as is often the case here)) , the internet loses its most powerful component: the diverse group of people using it.<p>I absolutely believe <500 low-paid shills with medium-level English can bring down sites like the likes of reddit. Bringing down does not mean putting them out of business -- that&#x27;s rather incidental -- it means creating fear and terror amongst a large part of the users to convince them that the majority of the internet is against them -- the internet is not the place for them. It is not just threatening women or minorities, obviously -- it could also be pretending to be an extremist feminist, and suggesting men should be hanged, burned etc, provoking the other group, and causing conflicts.<p>This is the issue why a lot of platforms have struggled with harassment and bullying issues, and it tickles me when the HN crowd --predominantly libertarian-- drones on about &#x27;free speech at any cost&#x27; (suggesting that any removal of extremely offensive content is tantamount to utter censorship), not realizing that an absolute free-for-all arena is most likely to be used by the parties with the most available resource to shape the conversation easily. To put it differently, if Russian trolls can reshape (partly?) the conversation, so can the American government, and so can any agency, with enough resources. To reiterate, it is not necessary to completely change people&#x27;s point of view -- just scare a targeted population away from a location, and identifying that is NOT as simple as &#x27;calling out the trolls&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;ll offload something tangential too here. When women say &#x27;there are issues for women in technology&#x27;, fellow HN users, the least correct response is to offer &#x27;well maybe if they worked harder instead of wasting time complaining, they&#x27;d have less issues&#x27;.

It solves fundamental problems.<p>Problem #1 - Audio speakers are <i>not</i> the same as instruments! If you&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of getting your hair blown back by a cranked guitar amp or a drum kit... well, you just can&#x27;t reproduce that experience through a set of earbuds. You can&#x27;t exactly reproduce the sound of an acoustic guitar in your lap, or a violin in a beautiful hall. Speakers just aren&#x27;t up to it. A recording is a <i>miniature</i> of a sound. Like all miniatures, it exaggerates some details and obscures others.<p>Second, most modern music consists of many instruments of different volumes and dynamic ranges played together. Mixing the sounds so everything sounds clear and balanced is <i>extremely</i> difficult. Some of the most important instruments are the worst about it - acoustic guitars and drum kits in particular walk all over everything else, with wide dynamic and frequency ranges that compete with steadier sounds. And certain harmonically-dense sounds like female vocals and violins can easily distort the audio amps used in reproduction. Compression, and its close cousin equalization, help engineers &quot;carve&quot; spaces for each instrument to live in.<p>You have probably never heard a recording without extensive compression, unless you&#x27;ve mixed records. And if you&#x27;ve been actively involved in recording, you&#x27;ll already know all this.",1447078205

If the simulation is as chaotic as reality, people lose track of the hooks that kept them involved - they no longer have the ability to make extensive plans or strategies, neither are there any puzzles to solve cleanly and gracefully. And if the simulation adds detail without purpose, it dilutes any designed intent. The small differences in situations are vastly overwhelmed by a few key elements that control the real outcomes - leading to a noisy experience. Only a few kinds of games can survive the extensive sim treatment - the kinds of games that you play with the intent of telling a story about later. Put to this purpose the details rise back to the surface as important story elements.<p>If not those two things, what is it that is grabbing you about Starcraft? Here I would pause to consider what unifies chess, science, and literature. It is the conversation of being posed problems and arguing your case and proving your points, given a factual situation involving arbitrary rules. There are different interactions involved in each case, different skills and levels of execution needed. But it is this thing of being posed interesting problems with variety, one after another, that drives both the best liked games and stories. They don&#x27;t have to be hard or deep problems - &quot;who will the main character hook up with&quot; drives countless stories and &quot;which team will get the most points&quot; drives most sports - but they give you something to chew on.<p>And so a writing focus is, in this light, an equal partner to a mechanics focus - either could be taking the lead role. The writing could pose a question that the player solves mechanically - that&#x27;s a very typical model. Or the writing could usher you in one direction, only to reach a mechanical contradiction, leading the player to a critique of the system, a desire to escape the rules.<p>What we don&#x27;t ask people to do in games is to design, from scratch, large parts of the experience. That takes us out of the realm of immersion, browsing, and strategizing, and into &quot;hard&quot; creativity where an intentional vision drives large bodies of work.",1447077819

7480006,comment,7475869,7476691,2,0,i-blis,,,"I remember that a significant part â€” up to a fifth, I would say â€” of the researchers and lecturers whose seminars I followed in the late 80s in France, either did not hold a doctorate or used to publish a big thing only once in a while but were nonetheless respected by their peers for their knowledge and commitment to science, and enjoyed secure academic positions. Nowadays, surviving in the academy without a PhD (or even, in countries like Germany, without the higher &quot;habilitation&quot;) and without abiding to the &quot;publish or perish&quot; rule has become increasingly unrealistic.<p>But it still happens, albeit at the margins. I have been working myself as a scientist in the academy for the last twenty years and even held assistant professorship positions in prestigious universities in Germany for almost ten years without a PhD and without much publications. In my case, that was most of the time due to a combination of factors: 1) the need for an outsider in the lab (particularly to avoid conflicts over scarce tenured professorship positions) 2) being able to teach and research  topics for which more than one person would have been needed otherwise 3) being (a little) known in the field, and known as eccentric but proficient at the job.<p>Funding is certainly an issue. You do need an academic affiliation (at least a formal one) to apply for grants. But I do not feel I have been less successful in securing funding from European and German research funds than colleagues with PhDs and habilitations and lots of publications. As soon as past projects were successfully completed, it has never been a big issue. The real problem is that in my field only fashionable and pointless projects are being funded lately.<p>As a consequence, I have come to carry my research almost completely independently. Coding and data analysis for private corporations and casual teaching at the university pay the bills. From time to time, I still rely on academic grants to fund field research. My wife and I work together and we have a very spartan way of life, dedicated to science and study.<p>Doing science at the margins of the academy implies its share of abnegation, is certainly viewed as bizarre by many but it happens. Although I do not complain, I won&#x27;t recommend it either.",1395924826

You can fit far more storage than what Everpix used comfortably in a half rack (e.g for density I can buy 5U servers storage servers with up to 48 x 4TB drives). In London, that runs me at most about $1k/month per site. Three sites for $3K/month. 400TB worth of off the shelf storage servers would run us ~$1600/month without even shopping around, in leasing cost per location, for ~$8000/month for triple redundancy on top of raid. Then there&#x27;s bandwidth.<p>400TB even at the Reduced Redundancy Storage pricing is ~$20k/month up until the price drop. With the price drop it looks like it&#x27;ll be more like $9300 with RRS, which is actually getting cheap enough that it&#x27;s worth it in some cases, to avoid having anyone spend their time on managing anything. The gap will increase again once you factor in request pricing and bandwidth, though, as even my standard price list prices for bandwidth would add up to less than the cheapest published bandwidth tier at Amazon with just a tiny little bit of hassle (BGP setup to multihome each sites with 2-3 different transit providers with different coverage - lowers cost by letting you pick a transit deal that does not give full access to the internet at very low cost coupled with a full price full coverage one)<p>Or I could spend about $12k/month at Hetzner for the same storage + an aggregate stated &quot;guaranteed&quot; bandwidth of about 2Gbps per location at no extra cost. Again, without shopping around. The moment you do more than about 20-30TB transfer/month, Hetzner becomes cheaper than S3 with that setup, and probably at about 50TB+/month it&#x27;d take effort to beat them when buying my own transit too.",1395924106

The size of the board has a strong impact on the nature of the game, though.<p>The obvious change is that larger boards take longer to complete, putting humans at a disadvantage if fatigue comes into play. Less obvious is that 21x21 changes the value of tradition strategies. It is generally considered equivalent to play for board-edge territory as for central influence on a 19x19 board, but on 21x21 playing for the easily-defended outer regions is too small. The value of the center means that it&#x27;s more valuable to play for central influence instead.<p>To answer your question in short: it&#x27;s possible, but expanding the board size could make the game unfamiliar and decrease the effective ranking of pros.",1395923212

The EU simply has nowhere near the fiscal integration of the US, so member states can really go off in their own direction despite all the supposed safeguards such as Maastricht.<p>I get that you&#x27;re pointing out that culturally Finland has less in common with Greece than Oregon has with Louisiana, but that was not always the case. The US just has had the benefit of a couple of hundred years of deep integration since the Louisiana purchase. Cuba is not part of any political association with the US, so naturally it can&#x27;t be compared.<p>Also... The US did bail out the Mexican government and save it from default in the 1990s, quite quickly and decisively. The fact that most people don&#x27;t even remember that, and yet so much ink has been spilled and so many teeth gnashed over whether, or how, or whether to break up the union instead says a lot about the fragility of the EU (to be expected of course, it&#x27;s still such a young institution). The integration and benefit to the states in the US has been enormously successful. Many would like to see the EU get there but it is still more correctly analogous to NAFTA which even though it was only a few years old and much less ambitious, played a big part in justifying the Mexican bailouts.<p><a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_economic_crisis_in_Mexico"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_economic_crisis_in_Mexic...</a>",1395922677

I think a more reasonable model in AI is for software to simulate the computational action of the neurones and for the mind to be analogous to the data that the software or neurones operate on. If you believe the brain is a machine following the laws of physics then this should be possible. The proof is in the pudding. Researchers have already been able to produce functional simulations of the retina and parts of the hearing system and get similar signals out which can then be fed back in to the brain successfully as seen in the contraption on Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s head.<p>Whether that extends to the rest of the brain we will see before long.

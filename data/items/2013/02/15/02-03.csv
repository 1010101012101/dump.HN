Especially if Tesla warns it will shorten the battery's life.<p>- It'd be better if Tesla's software took temperature into account when estimating mileage range.<p>- Broder is being ridiculous about the cruise control and his speed estimates, and the temperature.  He has partial accountability for the NYT graph.  Turning the temperature down to 70 does not mean ""sharply downward"".  He turned it down once more at around 250 miles, but that's far after the 182 that the article/graph indicates, and markedly different than ""a little over 200 miles"".  He writes about how his feet were freezing and knuckles were turning white, but he didn't turn the heat down below 70 until (if my math is right) right about the time he got to Manhattan, which was mentioned afterward in his article timeline.  On the other hand, it looks like it was turned down for most of the leg between Manhattan and Milford.<p>- The leg from Manhattan to Milford sounds legitimately stressful, but Broder claims low-speed cruise control that never happened.  He tries to blame this on wheel size later, while simultaneously using Tesla's logs as showing that he <i>wasn't</i> driving very fast.  That makes no sense.<p>- Tesla claims they told Broder to fully charge at Milford.  He did not, and lists a lot of justifications for not following their advice.<p>- Broder complains that Tesla didn't tell him more about how to get the most out of charging stations, but Broder's a veteran at electric vehicles even if it's true that he hates them.  And his defense for not charging overnight is laughable - plugging in overnight is not the same as plugging it at every Walmart stop.  It's overnight in cold temperatures and the car was at less than 50% of its range.  He's just being obstinate here.<p>- It's laughable to say that the Tesla fell short of its projected range when the projected range was from the day before, before not plugging it in on a cold night.<p>- Tesla and Broder directly contradict each other on whether they gave him the go-ahead to stop charging after an hour in Norwich.  Broder's being vague in his wordings - he phrases it as if they approved him to unplug when they might have just said to plug it in for about an hour when they were trying to find him the plugin station ahead of time.  Tesla, in turn, says that he unplugged over their objections.<p>- Broder just can't ""account for the discrepancy"" about the logs showing him driving close to 55 when he said he was limping along at 45, back from Norwich.<p>- Broder seems defensible on the parking brake - how is he to know not to turn off the car? - and the driving in circles, although it would be interesting to know just how clearly marked that supercharge station is.  Musk is probably guilty of the ""fundamental attribution error"" here.<p>Anyway, even after Broder's latest response, it still reads like Broder was trying to stack the deck.",1360896208

You still don't want to restart it multiple times a second, but you don't need to:<p>A two layer approach largely prevents this from being a problem. You can afford total overkill in terms of the number of haproxies as they're so lightweight - running a few hundred individual haproxy instances with separate configs even on a single box is no big deal.<p>The primaries would rarely need to change configs. You can route sets customers to specific sets of second layer backends with ACL's on short substrings of the hostname (e.g. two letter combinations), so that you know which set of backends each hostname you handle maps to, and then further balance on the full host header within that set to enable the second layer to balance on least-connections to get the desired effect.<p>That lets you ""just"" rewrite the configs and hot-reconfigure the subset of second layer proxies handling customers that falls in the same set on modifications. If your customer set is large enough, you ""just"" break out the frontend into a larger number of backends.<p>Frankly, part of the beauty of haproxy is that it is so light that you could probably afford a third layer - a static primary layer grouping customers into buckets, a dynamic second layer routing individual hostnames (requiring reconfiguration when adding/removing customers in that bucket) to a third layer of individual customer-specific haproxies.<p>So while you would restart <i>some</i> haproxy multiple times a second, the restarts could trivially be spread out over a large pool of individual instances.<p>Alternatively, ""throwing together"" a second or third layer using iptables either directly or via keepalived - which <i>does</i> let you do dynamic reconfiguration trivially, and also supportes least-connections load balancing - is also fairly easy.<p>But my point was not to advocate this as the best solution for somewhere like Heroku - it doesn't take a very large setup before a custom solution starts to pay off.<p>My point was merely that even with an off the shelf solution like haproxy, throwing together a <i>workable</i> solution that beats random balancing is not all that hard - there's a large number of viable solutions -, so there really is no excuse not to for someone building a PaaS.",1360895488

Certainly, a clever developer can do a lot with what's already there, but imagine if there were dozens upon dozens of complete, consistent sets of art covering everything you might need to make a game of a given genre there. Perhaps we'd get a lot of identical-looking games competing on mechanics alone for the right to be the ""definitive"" game to use this or that tileset, sprite set, etc. I wouldn't mind seeing that.<p>>They helped create and grow a market that the developers of RPG Maker now successfully sell to via Steam and other audiences with the latest versions of their product<p>Looks like it's played out like a Microsoft-type strategy for them, whether deliberately or not. A lot of kids from who cut their teeth on doing horrible things to pirated copies of Windows 9x, NT 4.0 or 2000 are now Microsoft's paying customers. I think Gates talks about this in an interview somewhere.<p>>A Blurred Line's developer was snapped up by Turbine to work on games like LOTRO<p>That's good to hear. Although it probably means that the rumors of him secretly developing  a remake/continuation of A Blurred Line are not to materialize.<p>>I look back on the year or two I spent helping run rpgmaker.net pretty fondly, even if they were a harsh introduction to the real nature of the internet (remember eFront?)<p>I participated in smaller, ""local"" RPG Maker communities and was mostly read-only in the larger ones but they were a constant source of  discussion, art assets, tips and, of course, new games. With that in mind I have to thank you for contributing your part. It was certainly an interesting environment for a young aspiring game developer to be in.<p>On a sad note, too bad all such communities (and I don't  just mean individual website or forums) eventually peter out. I feel that a lot of game development expertise disappears with them. Maybe a constantly evolving (free and open source?) game making tool could gather a similar community around it that would then last longer.<p>Edit: expanded last paragraph.",1360894580

Tesla certainly denies it. And this is the reason the review was ""bad"", so this gets to the crux of the issue.<p>What <i>at least</i> happened, according to Broder, is that they told him to ""plug it in for an hour, and then it <i>should</i> be good to go"". Note the ""should"". Broder <i>never actually says</i> that he called Tesla back when the hour was up, explained there was only 32 miles of range left on a 61 mile trip, and that Tesla said ""go for it, you are <i>cleared</i> for takeoff"".<p>So Broder found his angle, thinking: I'll plug it in for an hour, then just leave, no matter what the range says. Hopefully it'll die on me this time. [Ed: I made up that last part, for flavor.]<p>Unfortunately, Broder wrote that Tesla ""cleared him to leave"", which doesn't seem to be the case, and according to Tesla, was <i>not</i> the case, and that's why he's in the hot water that he's in. If instead he simply quoted the reps and said he didn't call back, despite the data, he'd be in the clear (although the story would be far less compelling, since it'd be clear to everyone that Broder is either an idiot, or has an agenda -- or both).<p>Either way, all we need to do is see if Broder made a call to Tesla when the hour was up. His cell phone log is sufficient, and Tesla might have similar data on their side. We don't need to know what was said, we just need to confirm that Broder <i>even had the opportunity</i> to be ""cleared"" to drive by Tesla. Once we confirm that, then the tapes would be helpful.

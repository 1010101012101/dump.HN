2449850,comment,2449520,2449520,18,0,strlen,,,"I sympathize with this view, but the very example given contradicts the thesis that this bubble will leave no technology in its wake.<p>Hadoop was developed at Yahoo, an advertising supported company. Some of the most interesting contributions (HDFS sync, RaidNode, AvatarNode) have come from Facebook, an ad supported company. Hadoop's architecture itself is inspired by the MapReduce and GFS papers from Google, another ad supported company. This shows that the premise is false: there is indeed technology transfer from the ""hot businesses"" to other companies and academia. Hadoop is the prominent example, but not the only one: many contributions to the Linux kernel come from Google, both Google and Facebook have also contributed extensively to MySQL.<p>The ad ranking and recommendation algorithms themselves are also by no means trivial, much of the work that goes on in that field (machine learning, information retrieval, natural language processing, large scale graph processing) is applicable elsewhere. The ""math wiz"" college graduates working on these fields, are going to be able to apply the skills they build elsewhere. Not to mention, the stock options, even if we assume modest outcomes, could pay for many a Ph.D. for engineers who wouldn't otherwise afford to take the time off from industry.<p>There are also products like GroupOn that don't seem to be technology driven at all, but that can change rather radically (e.g., Amazon's move from a technology consumer, to a producer of their own technology, to a company selling technology to others).<p>In other words, one doesn't have to sell technology to businesses in order to build technology that benefits others. There's nothing wrong with selling technology to businesses (and if I were to start my own company, I'd start one that does that, because I understand e.g., distributed databases and market for them better than I understand, e.g., machine learning and consumer marketing), but there's nothing wrong with providing an ad supported service to consumers, as long as interesting and universally applicable technology gets built in the process.",1302856250

We(or more accurately I) cannot simply turn my mind off and conform to social norms we can't justify. As an example, I understand the need to wear pants in public. That's not a problem. What I can't understand is how wearing a suit(a fashion that really hasn't changed in over 150 years) makes me more productive, improves the quality of my code. And I also cannot understand why I would ever need to wear a tie(except as a napkin, though that seems to be frowned upon.) So creatives can follow social structures they can justify, but won't conform for the sake of conformity. Again, I'm not a sociology professor, nor am I a psychologist, I'm someone who has been labeled both creative and eccentric most of my life.",1302856181

Times have moved on. 30 a months should buy access to everything, not just to 3-4 CDs' worth of music.<p>90% of the price of CDs is distribution and packaging. Those costs are nil on the internet, and therefore the price should be adjusted accordingly (and the record labels go bankrupt). If they can evolve and start providing a better value-add service (like, maybe, a very good interface for finding and downloading music) then they might be worth something. Atm the labels are just a leech on the back of artists and the public.<p>Anyway, if you <i>must</i> sell music trac-by-track, I would consider a per-track model that costs 10% of the price currently being used - i.e. 10 cents per track.

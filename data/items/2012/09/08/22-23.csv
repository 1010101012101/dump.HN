Given that the domain was not renewed in a timely fashion, the domain has now entered a 30 day 'Redemption Period'. During this period the registered owner may renew the domain by paying a redemption fee.<p>The Redemption Period is the 42 day time line available to domain owners to renew a domain after the expiration date. From Day 19 and on the domain registrant can renew with a Redemption fee. When your domain is in Redemption Status it has passed the expiration date, but has been reserved for an extended time frame for the domain owner on behalf of the domain registrar. A Redemption Fee is an $80.00 fee that must be paid to renew domains that have been expired for 19 days or longer. The Redemption Fee is initially paid by the Registrar to extend the registration and prevent the domain from being backordered or going onto the market.",1347144942

In political studies folks often use economic success as a proxy for evaluating the quality of governance, by that analysis the US system would score highly.  and African feudalism would score poorly. However such discussions are fraught with conditions, such as what are the natural resources available? What are the hindrances? China makes an interesting case because its economic growth under strict communism (Mao's model) was quite poor, whereas its economic growth under a more capitalist system (Den Xioping's model) has done much better. But its also perfectly valid to wonder if economics is a good proxy. What about life expectancy? happiness ? hunger?<p>Ultimately though you are going to run into debating philosophy and that makes for wonderful rhetoric but few conclusions.",1347144744

You know the type of place and the type of people it attracts: it's the smooth-talking-but-not-that-bright individuals who do well, and any smart employees who perceive the real problems the company is in find themselves a part of an outcast fringe.<p>Don't tell us we have bad customer service issues; expressing that kind of negative attitude is not going to impress senior management, what with bonus season coming up. Stripe and Square are just dipshit startups that no real business will ever use. La-la-la I can't hear you.<p>It seems someone at eBay finally realised PayPal was going to be ""disrupted"" if it didn't get a leader with their shit together. This new guy seems competent, but steering a big lumbering ship like PayPal away from its death course takes serious political/organisation-hacking skills, no matter how big the icebergs loom.",1347144503

Turn them loose without careful thought and at the very least you create massive chaos in your organization. But you also probably create substantial losses as fraudsters use the chaos to take a lot of money.<p>I think the only way you can get to the customer service experience you want is by starting with one customer's problems, solving them, and then changing the organization a bit so it's less dumb. Then you rinse and repeat for years.<p>It's an organization of thousands of people across the globe, with a zillion lines of code and, a ton of procedures and habits, and a lot of institutional inertia.

Also, you might still want at some point to keep extra information MusicBrainz wouldn't handle, even if you have a MusicBrainz ID stored in the file to identify the music.<p>About the ASCII, my point was just all about the fact that you can't actually keep only the international name and you need to store the name in different language version.

Normally the SDK is released a good number of months ahead of the release to allow time to incorporate bug fixes from developers.<p>If they are to release in late October then they go into serious lockdown by late September. Almost no time for any developer feedback.

4494274,comment,4491554,4492801,1,0,lsc,,,">This is the main difference between consumer-grade and enterprise-grade drives firmware. Take the HGST Deskstar and Ultrastar, or Seagate Constellation ES and Barracuda 2 TB; they are physically exactly the same, but behave very differently when encountering an error. Basically the enterprise drive will fail shortly BUT recover (because it's probably RAID-backed), while the desktop drive will try to read the data when asked at all prices (because it's probably NOT RAID-backed), therefore suffering from extremely long time-outs.<p>That is, in fact, why I pay the huge premium for 'enterprise' sata.<p>And yes, Usually 'enterprise' drives fail rather than just getting really slow.<p>But not always.  'enterprise' drives sometimes get shitty rather than just failing outright, too.  I mean, it's usually like 1/3rd to 1/5th expected performance rather than 1/100th, but this is disk.  It's already on the edge of unacceptably slow.  just cutting performance in half means I'm getting complaints.<p>Overall?  reducing this problem from twice a month to twice a year is worth the premium, but all spinning rust is shit.

Additionally, if I just let my mind wonder, I might think of something cool or something I forgot to do. Actually that last sentence is downplaying the importance of idle mind wondering. I have a habit of going out for walks specifically because it fosters this contemplative state. I even make efforts to avoid people when I walk because seeing people is often very distracting so quite often I walk at night and in isolated places.<p><i>Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down</i><p>Perhaps the metaphor shouldnt be taken so seriously but, you put down a tool because you cant use your hand very well while holding it. My brain is stuck in my head I dont see the benefit to turning it off, if that were even possible.<p><i>As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful.</i><p>What Tolle seems to be describing here is a person whos mind is filled with negative and harmful thoughts. It sounds like he is describing someone who is mentally ill. So unless thats you, its probably not relevant.<p>As for useless thoughts: I once did an experiment where I tried to write down everything as I thought it. It challenged my ability to type quickly more than anything but I noticed some interesting patterns nonetheless: 90% of everything I wrote was garbage. ""I wonder if..."" this and ""could you maybe..."" that. Even though this is the case with most of the stuff we think is that a reason to stop thinking? Also I would posit that its completely OK to think about a bunch of crap. Your mind is one of the few safe places where you can produce lots of crap without worrying that anyone is going to see it and scold you for it in some way. And Edward De Bono would absolutely testify to the importance of generative thinking activities in order to get at valuable ideas even if lots of crap is made in the process.<p>If you infer from this that I dont believe mindfulness you are only partially correct. Im actually a big believer in self-awareness and particularly awareness of feelings and also in metacognition (thinking about thinking). But I aspire to a healthy diet of all types of thinking. Sometimes active focus is called for, sometimes I allow myself to daydream, sometimes I think in an emotionless critical way, sometimes I forget about what is correct and just think about how I feel or other people are feeling, sometimes I go into idea mode and become really analytical about the way Im thinking and try to modify it to come up with different stuff. Each of these have their own advantages. An ideal might be to combine them or rapidly switch or maybe determine an optimum mixture. What people tend to do instead is habituate some more than others and consequently become better at some more than others. But the only time I think there is a problem, discussing at this level of abstraction, is when people fixate on one even when it isnt working. Developing a habit of deliberately mixing it up is probably a good idea.<p>All this is assuming you want to be good at all different types of things. If you only want to be a peaceful monk then mindfulness is probably the way to go. Why does it appeal to you anyway?",1347142361

I am not ""asserting,"" I am describing how black and white images are represented as color.  These images are BLACK AND WHITE until they go into PS. Get it? The color of a landscape today or 100 years ago is no different.  The fact that you could record monochromatic images in 1912 is not news.  In fact, the larger formats favoured in the era (viz, weston, adams, etc) blow away a 16 megapixel digital sensor. The <i>REPRESENTATIONS</i> of colour look <i>contemporary</i> because they <i>ARE</i> they are litereally using 16bit colour spaces and colour gamuts (adobe 1998, prophotoRGB, etc) that are less than 20 years old.  The images are not <i>airbrushed</i> but the Colour, saturation, contrast, sharpening (localized contrast) that give these images their ""look"" are about as ""Real"" as instagram on your iPhone.  In fact, you could put instagram image filters on top of these files, pretty easily.  To get that ""Retro"" look? Ironic, Eh?  There is no secret to it.  Its just odd that a with so many computer-literate people here there are so many comments that beg-the-question if people understand what they are looking at.  There is a simple, genius technique at work here: shoot a BW image with a colour filter.  That is not at all high tech, was not even in 1912 (see y/b sky filters, eg). Its very interesting to do some legwork on digital colour if you are unfamiliar with it.  The images are, for all intents and purposes, similar to what we are looking at from MARS.  Hope this helps.

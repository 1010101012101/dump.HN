A post that was voted up by 100 people and down by 100 people (assuming equal weights) will look exactly the same as one that nobody ever touched. It ruins the effectiveness of voting as a ranking mechanism.",1192452431

In the client?  On the server?  As a separate data base record?<p>I realize there is not one correct answer.  Just curious how other YC'ers handle situations like this.",1192451687

Altruism is too charitable, and hypocrisy too uncharitable.<p>Imagine yourself inside the head of, say, an abortion rights advocate.  A story appears with a headline saying that abortion is just as common where it's illegal.  You don't read it; you already know that; but you upvote it as a way of saying ""hear hear.""  Now apply the same rule to articles about Bush, Ron Paul, the RIAA, police abuses, etc, and you've filled up most of the frontpage of a site.<p>",1192450531

The general atmosphere in a VC meeting is that everyone around the table is having a discussion, the slides are there to facilitate the discussion.<p>John.\n",1192450491

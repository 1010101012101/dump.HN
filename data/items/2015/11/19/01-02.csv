I bet that once the identity of the Paris attackers was learned, the NSA pulled up a graph several levels deep of everybody they communicated it or associated with. It could very well help them figure out who else is involved and should be watched.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m opposed to surveillance and would be even if it were shown to be very effective. Privacy is important and is worth more than the lives that have been or will be lost to terrorists and other criminals.",1447898345

Cell phones only need a few different <i>types</i> of chips but they need them in <i>massive</i> quantities.<p>Second, the cost of creating a chip is too high.  The &quot;maker&quot; culture relies on the fact that creating a PCB is <i>cheap</i>.  Between the cost for EDA VLSI tools and the NRE for creating a mask set, you blow $100K before you even get started making a chip.  I suspect that we probably have the ability to digitally image 1.0um or larger features so we don&#x27;t have to cut a mask set, but it&#x27;s a chicken/egg problem.  Since nobody wants 1.0um+ processes anymore, nobody will develop the technology for them, so nobody will design for them, so nobody will want 1.0um+ processes.<p>Third, modern fab capacity is <i>ridiculous</i>.  A <i>single</i> 300mm wafer can produce <i>70,000</i> 1mm^2 chips or 700 1cm^2 (a big chip nowadays).  How many customers can consume those kinds of volumes?",1447898270

Second, if brilliant, non-tech scientists aren&#x27;t getting as high a wage as a code monkey then can you really say there is a shortage of non-tech scientists? One of the main justifications of the H1B program is that it fills a shortage. If there is a real talent shortage then wages should increase as the supply of available workers dwindles. Allocating visas based on wage is a rough attempt to identify the biggest shortages and fill them. It also helps address the criticism that H1B visas are used to drive down wages.",1447898246

The H1B issues can depend on when you graduate. 2 years before I graduated H1B visas were not in short supply. Students graduated and opted to go on OPT first before filing for H1B so they wouldn&#x27;t have to pay social security tax. The year after that, H1B visa applications were so high they had to do a lottery. This lottery happened for the next 3 years. 2 years after I graduated, the no of H1B applicants dropped back to the normal level that no lottery was required (I read in the papers that lots of foreigners opted to go back home because of the H1B issues and the bad economy). H1B application pool remained at that level for a few years and then went up again last year or the year before that.<p>So in summary, H1B applicant pool can vary from year to year so don&#x27;t cross it off your list yet",1447897882

Especially for systems that have a lot of background processing, but need a web front-end (because enterprise, and dashboards!), it is a drag to have everything go down because IIS has decided to recycle your app pool due to 20 minutes of front-end inactivity.  Yes, you can change the settings to disable that, or architect things differently to separate the UI from the background service, but it is extra complexity that is a pain.  Building a Windows service that has a light-weight webserver built into it is much easier.<p>IIS also has too many knobs that can get fiddled and frig things up.  Before we switched, I&#x27;d always be on support calls to help a customer fix one of our products after their sysadmin tweaked something in a way to break us, or installed some other piece of software that stomped on us.<p>IIS also has a very conservative set of defaults if you naively install it.  Seriously, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of instances where customers install IIS, and CSS doesn&#x27;t get served - you have to install an additional Static Content module.  People don&#x27;t read instructions, or bother to run required setup scripts.

10592188,comment,10580952,10589172,0,0,nickles,,,"0.1% is far from trivial. If you purchased SPY at the open and sold at the close today, you would have paid 0.1% of the open and 0.1% of the close, or 38% (back of the napkin math) of your profit on the trade in tax. And, that&#x27;s in addition to any capital gains taxes you need to pay on the profit already.<p>You appear to be confusing creation/redemption with rebalancing. Creation/Redemption occurs at end of day when people enter and exit the fund. In the trivial example, suppose you&#x27;re paying for a full unit of the fund (so 1 share of MSFT, 1 share of RHT, etc.) Then the fund manager will need to go and purchase 1 share of everything for you. Now there is also rebalancing, where the index being tracked changes. Suppose we have SPY. There were 20 instances throughout 2015 where the symbols in the S&P 500 were changed. Even if no one created or redeemed SPY, the fund manager would be subject to 40 transaction taxes simply to track the index (sell the old shares being replaced and buy the new one in the index).<p>SPY, for the record, has an expense ratio of 0.09%. How can State Street afford to manage the ETF for you in the face of this tax? Well to start, you will pay higher fees, which will lower your returns.<p>I also looked into the details of the tax [1]. It has horrifying economic ramifications:<p>* Up to 90% reduction in derivative transactions -- Markets are meant to move capital to people and firms who need it and risk from those who don&#x27;t want it to those who want it. Derivatives are exceptionally important and reducing their use is a bad thing. For example, Apple needs to buy phones in one currency (Yuan) and sell them in another (USD). They face exchange rate risk, as the value of the two currencies fluctuate relative to one another. Apple can enter into a derivative to exchange their potential upside if the exchange rate fluctuates in its favor for a guaranteed exchange rate. Without these contracts, global commerce would be severely restricted.<p>* A long-run (20-year) reduction in gross domestic product -- this reduces levels of consumption across society, reducing tax income from other sectors and reducing employment, increasing the demand for government services. In other words, you are reducing the ability for the government to pay for services that it now will need to provide more of.<p>* An effective curb on automated high-frequency trading -- Why is this a good thing? HFT ensures greater liquidity in the market and simultaneously ensures that the prices of assets more accurately reflect their true value.<p>* An increase in capital costs, which could be mitigated by excluding primary markets for bonds and shares from the tax -- Increasing capital costs reduces economic growth, job opportunity, and R&D. The mitigation proposed is not as effective as one might think, as any purchaser in the primary market understands that the asset is less desirable in the secondary market to a purchaser as a result of the transaction tax there.<p>This tax is bad economic policy and will hurt everyone in the long run. However, it is a popular sentiment to want to punish financial institutions because they were bailed out. However, it&#x27;s less popular to acknowledge that the government has made a substantial profit on those bailouts [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_financial_transaction_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_financial_trans...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/</a>",1447897270

A backdoor would be more <i>convenient</i> for them, but encryption of your communications between you and the bank does not mean the bank is encrypting your financial and demographic information in such a way that they themselves will not be able to retrieve it.<p>What&#x27;s being discussed here is the Apple strategy, where the service provider can provide a service to the public without the ability to retrieve information generated by the service.<p>The desire for companies to provide such services was likely spurred by the government&#x27;s insistence that they provide private encryption keys, even in the event that they provide access to encrypted information not limited to the direct subject of a warrant, and the federal courts&#x27; repeated confirmation of the government&#x27;s power to enforce such requests. See the demise of Lavabit [1].<p>There are numerous technical workarounds to this problem; for example, a private-key infrastructure that generates one key pair per message, or per customer.

When the needle is vertical the probability it cross a line is 1, when horizontal it is zero.  The length of the needle L is the hypotenuse of a triangle. If we call the angle from horizontal x, the &quot;height&quot; of the needle can be anywhere within h=Lsin(x) for x between 0 and pi/2.<p>The &quot;lines&quot; are like a sample of a point from a uniform distribution U with width L, and h is an interval inside U. The probability a number sampled from a distribution of width L will fall within interval h is h/L.

As mentioned, x can range between 0 and pi/2. To get the probability the needle drops at angle x1 OR x2 OR x3, etc and cross we need to sum all these.

Presumption of accuracy  Just because the cops claim that the money is &quot;Drug money&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it so.  As a victim of asset forfeiture, that money was claimed to be &quot;Terrorism&quot; money but it was laughable on its face.<p>2. Presumption of guilt.  Even if it was taken from a genuine drug dealer, the dealer is innocent until proven guilty, but the money is taken before this proof is achieved.  Thus this denies the dealer the opportunity to provide for his defense.<p>Someone I went to high school with was the victim of this. He was not a drug dealer, he was a doctor.  An oncologist who had a great many terminal patients.  He was raided by the DEA because he was giving these cancer patients &quot;too much&quot; pain medication.  His assets and house were frozen, he was taken to jail and his wife and kid were left homeless while he had to try and defend himself...with no money to hire a lawyer.   His wife worked part time as a receptionist in his office- so the prosecutor threatened to put her in jail as an accomplice, forcing his kids into the &quot;Care&quot; of the state if he didn&#x27;t take a plea deal.  He had no money for counsel, and no choice so he plead guilty.   This is a doctor whose &quot;crime&quot; was caring for his patients.  You would say he must have been guilty because he was convicted.  And therefor this is drug money, but that&#x27;s a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, and misses the point that he was forced to plead guilty by having his ability to hire a defense team denied to him via the theft.<p>Finally, you&#x27;re being absurd to say that you have access to the courts and that they are impartial.  As my case showed me, the judge knew that the affidavit for seizure of the property was fraudulent-- he knew it, because he had been presented proof of it the week prior-- yet he still authorized the theft.   The cops and the judges and the prosecutors all work for the state, and the judges are not independant.  They are dependent on keeping their job by towing the line.<p>This is why cops and judges are almost never prosecuted.  No cop would dare testify, no prosecutor will bring charges and no judge would allow the case in his court.",1447895525

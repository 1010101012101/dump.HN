Having said that, the times I've worked in good pair programming environments have been the happiest, most productive times of my life (at work, anyway).<p>So then, what constitutes ""good""? This article seems to focus on the code, which I think can matter, but I believe is much less important than the people having the ability to pair effectively, which in my experience consists of two things: (1) the ability to clearly articulate what one is thinking, in real-time, and (2) the ability to allow your partner's ideas to be better than your own. It also helps if you don't get annoyed by someone asking you questions while you code, but that's less important, because you'll get over that if you and your coding partner have (1) and (2).",1248101875

Scott Bakker, an almost-but-so-fed-up-with-it-that-he-gave-it-up PhD in Philosophy about the experiential consequences of neuroscience.<p>However, I will argue that this differs significantly from postmodern philosophy in one key respect: while anti-foundationalism certainly is a hallmark of the school of thought, it is never founded on objective scepticism, like science. Even the points made by neuroscience (and Scott Bakker) will have to be undermined by postmodernism, as any one viewpoint (or Meta Narrative) inflects any other viewpoint and has nothing behind it but the authority of people in power.<p>I have a BA in English, and to the best of my knowledge and training, postmodernism is a manifestly worthless endeavour. When concepts like knowledge, empiricism, veracity, and progress become nothing but whips in the hands of the powerful, you've effectively gotten yourself into a rut you can't get out of. As a result, English departments are dying all over the US. For a detailed look at this, get Jonathan Gottschall's brilliant ""Literature, Science, and a New Humanities.""",1248101260

There are plenty of resources for learning Clojure, but I haven't found any that help with the transition from object oriented programming to functional programming. I read <i>Programming Clojure</i> and I feel like I know the language, but I'm still working on thinking in terms of functional programming. Interestingly, <i>Programming in Scala</i> has helped some. The hybrid functional/object oriented approach has helped introduce functional concepts with a language that doesn't seem so foreign. It can be difficult to pick up a completely different language (different from C-like languages, anyway) as well as a new programming model at the same time. <i>JavaScript: The Good Parts</i> is also good for the same reason.<p>There's also an F#/C# book scheduled to come out later this year that looks like it might be good for learning the functional thought process: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Real-World-Examples/dp/1933988924/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1248098702&sr=8-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Real-World-Exam...</a><p>I found this blog post from Stuart Halloway to be informative as well: <a href=""http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/9/25/pcl-clojure-chapter-17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/9/25/pcl-clojure-chapter...</a>",1248098897

The Japanese may have different tastes than the western audience, but there definitely is a huge amount of effort spent on just how the phones look. There are cool design choices (like the swivel screen mentioned in the article), boring ones (dozens of different color casings), and a huge amount of after-market customization paraphenelia (stickers, ""jewellery"", straps, etc.) available. Some cell phone stores and craft stores have prominent displays showing off ridiculously overdone pimped phones covered in gleaming stickers.<p>What I meant to say earlier was that this look could appeal to some people in the west too. Some people just want something that looks different than the iphone or razr. I know my wife loved the cute pink clamshell phone she had in Japan (that I spent days trying to jailbreak afterwards).",1248098712

Even if electricity is relatively expensive in your area (as it is in China) the amount of electricity needed for running an electric bike (as compared to the operating costs for a car) is trivial. What you do need are good rechargeable batteries - and those batteries will eventually need to be replaced.",1248098683

The Twitter Fail whale doesn't happens because of front-end problems, nor Facebook's slowness, nor the cpu overload you see on your thumbnail processing machines, nor the mem crashes you experience when memcache servers run out of memory...<p>I do agree with you that a lot of what users experience as slowness IS front-end stuff. BUT there is also a lot of issues with the backend not working as expected. Lets say, front-end optimization is like shooting the low hanging fruit :) Nevertheless you're right I should have commented it somewhere.",1248098625

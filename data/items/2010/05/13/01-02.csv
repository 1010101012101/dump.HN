1342988,comment,1342465,1342891,0,0,sshumaker,,,"1. Yes, git stash is an option.  Unfortunately, if it's anything like mercurial's shelve, it's not a good one.  What happens when you 'unstash'?  Does it properly give you conflict markers, or does it generate patchfiles?<p>The latter is mercurial's behavior, and it sucks.  To do the former, the stash command needs to also track the repo version that the local changes were based upon, so it has the historical information to present conflict markers (effectively, enough info for a 3-way merge).<p><i></i>\nFWIW, This is actually the only thing holding my team back from switching back to hg.  If hg shelve were part of the standard distribution and rock solid (multiple shelves would form a queue, no chance of corruption, and unshelve preserved historical information so it could properly merge conflicts), the world would be a better place.  :)\n<i></i><p>2. Yes, I know WHY it does what it does.  But the way it presents this info is unfortunate, because after a merge it's far more difficult to know exactly which changes you were making - many programmers are in the habit of reviewing their changes before committing.

1342973,comment,1342740,1342740,0,0,commandar,,,"I seem to be in the minority, but I'm not a huge fan of the UI design in the new official Twitter app. My biggest complaints:<p>Pattern 3: The Dashboard<p>Not a huge fan of this, mainly because it feels redundant and adds to the app's inconsistency. <i>Some</i> features can be accessed directly from the tweet screen while others require you to navigate back to the dashboard. Where Android apps have traditionally allowed direct navigation between functions by way of the Menu button on the phone, Twitter drops that functionality pretty much entirely.<p>Pattern 4: The Action Bar<p>Not a bad idea in and of itself, but it feels poorly implemented to me. The biggest issue isn't the action bar itself, but the fact that they chose to add a second, permanent UI bar directly below it for navigation between tweets, mentions, and favorites. If you're using the phone in landscape mode, you've lost nearly a third of your vertical screen real estate to permanent UI elements. The UI should get out of my way and let me interact with content.<p>This also plays into my complaint about Pattern 3 and inconsistent navigation between features. This secondary bar replicates part, but not all, of the functionality of the the dashboard. You can't really be sure which navigation path is going to be open to you until you follow one.<p>Pattern 6: QuickActions<p>Again, the primary issue here is consistency. The QuickAction bar pops up above a tweet when you tap it... except when it doesn't. If a tweet is too far up the screen when you tap it, the QuickAction bar pops up below the tweet. (And because of the vertical screen real estate problem from Pattern 4, your chances of not having enough screen space for the bar in landscape mode and running into it behaving inconsistently are as good as not). Not a major, major issue, but it is slightly jarring. If there's not enough space to display the QuickAction bar in a consistent location, it seems to me that the app should scroll the timeline down so that there is.<p>Personally, I'd also be in favor of making that consistent location <i>below</i> the selected tweet -- it's much easier to tap once and then again with your thumb by moving down than it is to do the reverse since it mimics the natural motion of balling your hand. I feel like I'm having the stretch to reach the newly revealed UI elements in the official app.<p>I guess the thing for me is that I agree with everyone that this app is one of the prettiest on the Android platform, and I'm thrilled to see contact syncing expanding beyond Facebook; I just haven't understood the raves about the UX end of the app. It's certainly not bad, but I came away feeling like the whole thing was half-baked from a usability perspective. There's definitely a lot of potential here, but it needs some serious interface work before it becomes my daily use Twitter app.",1273715496

1342969,comment,1341340,1342483,0,0,briansmith,,,"IE8 does sometimes put multiple tabs in one process, but not all tabs are in the same process. I think Microsoft should move to one-process-per-tab too; if Chrome can do it without any negative performance impact (AFAICT), so should IE. But, I'm not sure the rest of what Chrome does would be useful in IE. Microsoft wants to keep the security enforcement in the operating system so that all native applications can benefit from it. Google is happy to have lots of security enforcement in Chrome itself because it doesn't really care about the security of anything other than Chrome, and it cares about platforms that don't have the security features that Windows has.<p>In particular, one thing that's strange about NaCL is that plugin processes have stronger security than Chrome itself  (unless Chrome is being built with the same or similar NaCL toolchain). In Microsoft's design, plugins are protected equally with the IE tab processes themselves, which seems very sensible to me, considering all the untrusted content that the browser itself has to interpret.<p>I would still like to know, theoretically, what Chrome's design stops that cannot be stopped using IE8's design,  modified to have one tab per process.",1273715316

This may be fine in any given project if the founders have the talent, vision, and integrity to comport themselves consistently with the trust placed in them to do what they say they will do when they solicit the donations. If they do not have integrity, however, I am not sure what remedies might exist if they should prove less than scrupulous in dealing with the donated funds.<p>This is a pretty new area and I'm not very familiar with it. But it would appear on the surface that there is not much that can be done if founders in such situations choose to abuse the trust reposed in them by the donors. Given this problem, I don't see how this model can easily be replicated across a meaningful spectrum of situations, even though it might work for select high profile cases.",1273714879

For example, hg diff will show you changes of both merged and unmerged stuff, but thanks to the index, git diff will show only the unmerged stuff. When you start fixing conflicts, when you add files with git add, those are not shown anymore with git diff (but are through git diff --cached). The index has a high learning curve, though.<p>The other killer feature is code tracking: git blame -C -M is extremely powerful. It can tells you that which changes are coming from which file (through  heuristics, so it also works for code converted to git, e.g. git-svn). I explained this in more details there <a href=""http://cournape.wordpress.com/2009/05/12/why-people-should-stop-talking-about-git-speed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cournape.wordpress.com/2009/05/12/why-people-should-s...</a>.<p>I think in the end, git is actually simpler than hg - that is, the UI is awful, but the underlying model is simple. For example, the branching model in git is simpler than hg. In hg, you have branch-through-clone, bookmark, branches created by hg branch ( <a href=""http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/08/a-guide-to-branching-in-mercurial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/08/a-guide-to-branching-in-me...</a>). This is maybe a matter of personal opinion, but I hate simple version numbers in DVCS (I changed from bzr to git because I wasted a lot of time with bzr so-called simple numbers). With DVCS, it is impossible to have a consistent version scheme (that is at some point, you <i>will</i> have several branches with the same simple version referring to different commits). One thing to understand is that you almost never need to use the raw id in git, because most commands understand a lot of different syntax such as HEAD^, HEAD~, branch names and tags. If I need to refer to a commit more than once, I use a tag for it.<p>One think which git got wrong IMO is fast-forward when pulling: it means you lose branch information, and the history is hard to understand (it complicates life for bisect or continuous integration) - I change the pull command to make pull non fast forward by default in git.<p>Going back to svn is insane if you ask me, at least for usual usage of source-code only (DVCS currently suck at assets management). I agree with the OP that branching is sometimes used too much by git users, but branching for release management, code reviews, etc... has saved me hours of work as a release manager on several middle-sized open source projects (through git-svn).<p>Git got the low-level stuff right, but I think we have barely seen what's possible with DVCS. Bug-tracker integration, code-review integration, etc... are still in infancy.",1273714476

Imagine trying to get to grips with a Unix shell, if you had no concept of files or directories. In such a scenario, even a simple command like ""cat"" would seem incomprehensible.<p>If you'll indulge me, I'd like to propose a thought experiment.<p>* * Designing a patch database * *<p>Consider you're responsible for administering a busy open source project. You get dozens of patches a day from developers and you find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them. How might you go about managing this influx of patch files?<p>The first thing you might consider is how do you know what each patch is supposed to do? How do you know who to contact about the patch? Or when the patch was sent to you?<p>The solution to this is not too tricky; you just add some metadata to the patch detailing the author, the date, a description of the patch and so forth.<p>The next problem you face is that some patches rely on other patches. For instance, Bob might publicly post a patch for a great new scheduler, but then Carol might post a patch correcting some bugs in Bob's code. Carol's patch cannot be applied without first applying Bob's patch.<p>So you allow each patch to have parents. The parent of Carol's patch would be Bob's patch.<p>You've solved two major problems, but now you face one final one. If you want to talk to other people about these patches, you need a common naming scheme. It's going to be problematic if you label a patch as ABC on your system, but a colleague labels a patch as XYZ. So you either need a central naming database, or some algorithm that can guarantee everyone gives the same label to the same patch.<p>Fortunately, we have such algorithms; they're called one-way hashes. You take the contents of the patch, its metadata and parents, serialize all of that and SHA1 the result.<p>Three perfectly logical solutions, and ones you may even have come up with yourself under similar circumstances.<p>* * Merging patches * *<p>Under this system, how would a merge be performed? Let's say you have two patches, A and B, and you want to combine them somehow. One way is to just apply each in turn to your source, fix any differences that can't be automatically resolved (conflicts), and then produce a new patch C from the combined diff.<p>That works, but now you have to store A, B and C in your patch database, and you don't retain any history. But wait! Your patches can have parents, so what if you created a 'merge' patch, M, with parents A and B?<p><pre><code>   A   B\n    \ /\n     M\n</code></pre>\nThis is externally equivalent to what you did to produce C: patches A and B are applied to the source code, and then you apply M to resolve the differences. M will contain both the differences that can be resolved automatically, and any conflicts we have to resolve manually.<p>Having solved your problem, you write the code to your patch database and present the resulting program to your colleague.<p>* * A user tries to merge * *<p>""How do I merge?"" he asks.<p>""I've written a tool to help you do that,"" you say, ""Just specify the two patches you want to combine, and the tool will merge them together.""<p>""Um, it says I have a merge conflict.""<p>""Well, fix the problem, then tell the system to add your file to the 'merge patch' it's making.""<p>Your colleague dutifully hacks away, and solves the conflict. ""So I've fixed the file,"" he says, ""But when I tell it to 'commit file' it fails.""<p>""Remember, this is a patch database,"" you reply, ""We're not dealing with files, we're dealing with patches. You have to add your file changes to your patch, and then commit the patch. You can't commit an individual file.""<p>""What? That's not very intuitive,"" he grumbles, ""Hey! I've added the file to the patch, but it tells me the merge isn't complete!""<p>""You need to add all of the files that have differences that were automatically resolved as well.""<p>""Why?!""<p>""Because,"" you explain patiently, ""You might not like the way those files have been changed. It needs your approval that the way it's resolved the differences is correct.""<p>""Why to I have to re-commit everything my buddy has made?"" he complains, ""Seriously, I want to just commit <i>one</i> file.

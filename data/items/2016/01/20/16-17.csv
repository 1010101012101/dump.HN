Heart disease claims over 600,000 lives annually in the US. [2]<p>Compared to other top killers, if we could reduce gun related deaths to ~10,000 annually, that&#x27;s a huge victory. That equates to about 0.001% of our population annually, and at that rate it would take about 33,000 years to kill us all.<p>In no reality are we going to be able to make that number be zero. There must be some level that is acceptable (and arguably we&#x27;ve crossed that acceptable threshold currently).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/us_flu-related_deaths.h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm</a>",1453309143

Instructive in this connection is a key equation from his first relativity paper (<a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/</a>):<p>β = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2))<p>(sorry -- the original paper doesn&#x27;t number its equations)<p>It should seem obvious that this equation describes a relation between orthogonal dimensions, something that Einstein didn&#x27;t realize, but that Minkowski certainly did. Minkowski expanded and clarified Einstein&#x27;s mathematics in order to express time as a separate dimension, then made his famous remark about spacetime: &quot;Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality&quot;.<p>Einstein then remarked, &quot;Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore.&quot; But in subsequent years Einstein learned much more mathematics, and the general theory is much more dependent on mathematical ideas than the special theory was, indeed the general theory can&#x27;t be meaningfully expressed without advanced mathematics.",1453309092

10939437,comment,10928958,10928958,0,0,gizmo,,,"The article equates prosecutorial misconduct to force a guilty sentence with editorial choices in a documentary. Because both show &quot;bias&quot;. In the one case it&#x27;s utterly illegal and it undermines the moral validity of the justice system and in the other case we&#x27;re talking about a simple exercise of free speech, but apparently this distinction isn&#x27;t meaningful in the eyes of the author.<p>The quote in question: &quot;The point of being scrupulous about your means is to help insure accurate ends, whether you are trying to convict a man or exonerate him. Ricciardi and Demos instead stack the deck to support their case for Avery, and, as a result, wind up mirroring the entity that they are trying to discredit.&quot;<p>This equivocation is morally repugnant.<p>The article also gets their facts wrong. They claim: &quot;Investigators subsequently found DNA from Avery’s perspiration on the hood latch—evidence that would be nearly impossible to plant.&quot;. This is a fabrication. There is no distinction between blood DNA, sweat DNA, skin DNA. DNA was found under the hood latch, but no blood was seen. Hence a logical conjecture is that the source is perspiration, but it could have been any other source. As for it being hard to plant, that&#x27;s laughable. Simply swipe a t-shirt or dirty sock on any surface and it will leave DNA behind. None of Avery&#x27;s finger prints were found on the car, and finger prints ARE hard to plant. In contrast to DNA, which IS trivial to plant if you have access to somebody&#x27;s apartment.<p>The charge that the documentary is bad because doesn&#x27;t display a clear timeline of the events doesn&#x27;t make sense, because it&#x27;s the responsibility of the prosecution to explain what happened, and they didn&#x27;t have a single narrative that was consistent with all the evidence. Which is why the prosecution&#x27;s story of what happened was completely different in Avery&#x27;s and Dassy&#x27;s trials.<p>Juries don&#x27;t believe police officers would ever lie during testimony. They believe the police are the good guys who just want to catch the bad guys. The public has to let go of this naive view of the world, and look at all evidence presented during a trial with healthy skepticism. The &#x27;Making a Murderer&#x27; documentary teaches people to be skeptical about claims by the police, which is a great public service.<p>The article closes by reiterating the terrible equivocation they made earlier. That exposing prosecutorial misconduct is somehow only permissible in a completely unopinionated format. The New Yorker should be ashamed for publishing this trash.",1453309037

They did their background checks and after a month or two mailed back my license. You need to renew it every 3 years, but it&#x27;s basically a matter of making sure the information is correct and sending in a check.<p>The benefits of having an FFL03:<p>- Eligible guns can be shipped direct to your door (no handguns shipped in California)<p>- You can buy C&R eligible guns out-of-state and bring them back with you.<p>In any case, you must provide the seller with a copy of your license prior to purchase.",1453308588

We have Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles.  The guided missile was the superior weapon.  Until the Mig 15 came up - Armed with 2 23mm canons, and 1 37mm canon.  The Mig outmaneuvered the F4s and provided surpassingly deadly.  The US was forced to put guns on the F4s and retrain its crews in dog fighting.  The US never really gained superiority until they released the Sabre - which was again based on speed, maneuverability and packed a wallop of guns in addition to missiles.

This very fine-grained packaging results in its own kind of dependency hell and a sort of artificially forced update schedule where updating one package to fix a bug or get some useful new feature has a knock-on effect that forces updates of numerous other things to remain compatible (or not, if those updates themselves break things or introduce new bugs).<p><i>From my way of thinking your example only handles the single file, what happens when you complicate the matter a bit more? Do you end up recreating gulp in the end?</i><p>Yes, that kind of command would be for a web app with a single entry point JS file generated from a single starting source file. But even that case, the simplest possible, requires a lot of boilerplate for no benefit at all in Gulp. Worse, the required boilerplate has changed several times within a year or two just to keep the Gulp infrastructure working.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you have in mind for &quot;when you complicate the matter&quot;, but I have yet to see an example related to Browserify that Gulp made any easier, even on projects with multiple targets each with their own starting point for building. So no, I don&#x27;t see how any greater complexity I&#x27;ve encountered on a real project would wind up recreating a Gulp-like tool in the end (though of course that&#x27;s just my own experience and doesn&#x27;t mean no-one else has such a project).",1453308195

Rails 3 removed many of those. Rails 4 even more so. Check out the book &quot;Crafting Rails 4 Applications&quot; to see how easy it is to hook into places in the framework to get what you need. (Disclosure: I&#x27;m the editor of that book.)<p>I currently maintain both Rail 2.3 and Rails 4 applications. I totally agree that Rails 4 is a much smoother experience. There are still hacks around the magic that I&#x27;ve had to implement.

If people are coming away with the impression that the system will blow up or otherwise misbehave when they try to peel back the covers, it&#x27;s ignorance to just blame them for feeling wrong. One should try to at least understand the problem; then, you can decide if it&#x27;s a problem that needs correction or if you&#x27;re just OK with people who want some flexibility and cooperation from the framework not using your stuff and be honest about that so that they don&#x27;t have to waste their time.<p>>Remember, for centuries, people used &quot;magic&quot; to explain away something they didn&#x27;t understand. :)<p>And, also for centuries, people used &quot;magic&quot; to hoodwink gullible people.",1453308167

It was desirable for all marketplace submissions to be reviewed by a set of humans who were paid for that effort by the review. The existing system for doing this was in a bad state. By &quot;bad state&quot; I mean coded in a legacy system with no tests or even separation of concerns (think of a system that iterates over the results of a query, making additional queries and rendering JavaScript snippets to the page in this loop) and hitting scalability limits as it made exciting joins across the company&#x27;s master database.<p>The company&#x27;s architectural model dictated that the new version should take the form of a (non-micro) RESTful service layer handling the data in its own database (also facilitating the application of the problem to new lines of business for different varieties of marketplace item under different brands, improving visibility to the review process to sellers, and leaving open an avenue to outsource or automate certain parts of the problem.) We would migrate the legacy code over to use this layer instead, then we would write new frontend code with better workflows, then we&#x27;d coordinate with other teams to review new classes of marketplace item with different review criteria, then some year we&#x27;d have room for the pie-in-the-sky machine-learning-assisted review (assuming that something more important didn&#x27;t come up instead.)<p>The result of this was a modestly complex set of abstract business-data objects, including marketplace items, all the metadata associated with them (editable by reviewers in this system), owners of items, reviewers, reviews, internally visible comments associated with the reviews, feedback associated with the reviews, review escalation, reviewer-supervisors, and a variety of other things which I forget right now.<p>I say RESTful: while not as pure as it could be, it actually did a half-decent job of being hypermedia-y and not merely &quot;throw some JSON around over HTTP&quot;. Things had URLs instead of just IDs. Lists of objects were paginated with consistent ways to get links to the next/previous page.<p>Sinatra left us with uncomfortable choices between having excessive code duplication and the quality/maintainability issues it would bring, or writing our own logic to ferry Sinatra&#x27;s various handles to the request / response / templating engine.

Also many of the newer games have </i>NIX support by default too (source engine games for example).<p>EDIT: a link to someone complaining of this issue on Microsoft forums: <a href=""http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-gaming/directdraw-emulation-is-broken-in-windows-881/4edfc685-72b2-4688-95ed-c745ddd38825"" rel=""nofollow"">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-g...</a>",1453306947

If I&#x27;m only comparing computers just based on the parts inside them and their capability then there&#x27;s little to no reason for me to buy an Apple computer because other than some sorta neat things like the hybrid drives or some of the Thunderbolt integration, they&#x27;re generally much more expensive than building or buying another computer.<p>But for people who value specific software that is OSX-only or some of the features only found in OSX (like CoreAudio for music stuff) or the general interface polish and perceived stability, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the Apple option costs $2000 and the other brand/build with similar core components costs $1000.  If it doesn&#x27;t run the platform you want/need then it doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s more bang for the buck.<p>Basically I default to Windows because for the things I do on a computer, it&#x27;s got the most flexibility and options for hardware and software.  Linux is missing too many applications I need/want and OSX only runs on machines that cost a good deal more while offering nothing I really need enough to justify the cost.  But when I&#x27;ve needed or wanted to run an OSX application in the past (Final Cut Pro in my case several years ago) it just wasn&#x27;t a question.  The stuff I wanted to run and the hardware I needed to hook up required OSX so that&#x27;s the only reason I shelled out for an Apple computer.

Even in the criminal system, if you yell, &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill you&quot; and run at me with a knife, you may feel that you are joking. But, if I feel fear for my physical safety, my feeling of fear overwhelms your feeling that it was a joke.<p>You&#x27;re also not thinking through the entire system. You seem to be under the belief that criminal/tort law requires an actual physical injury. That is simply not the case.<p>> So, if I&#x27;m hurt by how stupid what you wrote is, should you be lose your job or be jailed?<p>> Basing laws on feelings is the most stupid and abuse-prone idea I&#x27;ve ever heard.<p>And, that is why we have lawyers and judges.<p>Consider laws about assault. Assault does not require actual physical harm in order to be a criminal or tortious act. It only requires two elements:<p>- the assaulter needs to demonstrate intent. This requires more than words.<p>- the victim needs to feel fear for his/her safety.<p>Or, let&#x27;s consider laws about sexual harassment. In the United States, simple teasing is not illegal, but it can become illegal if it creates an offensive or hostile work environment. The feeling has to be justified (hence the role of judges and lawyers), but it is still all about feelings and reactions.<p>You should read the US civil rights act.

I used these exact examples a while back to argue for dropping Gulp from a project I work on, and at that point the Browserify logic in the Gulp file ran to nearly a dozen lines of boilerplate, which had been substantially changed at least twice since the start of the project, while the ESLint task had stopped working, for reasons that we never determined but which certainly didn&#x27;t involve ESLint itself not working.",1453305643

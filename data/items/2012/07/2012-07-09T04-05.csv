But the British didn't come here to unite us and do the 'greater good' as often claimed. Was India made up of smaller states, yes it was.<p>But you need to study the geographical boundaries of Mainland India throughout history. They extend all the way till Iranian borders. To southern tips of Russia. Afghanistan was once a part of India(Kandhahar was basically Gandhara, Remember the Gandhari from Mahabharatha?).<p>In this mammoth period of time(lasting several millenniums). India has been ruled by people of varying ethnicity, language, color, culture, heritage etc. Therefore you have so many religions, languages, traditions etc. Sometimes the whole mainland India was united, sometimes it got split.<p>The difference between British and somebody like Mughals is the difference between. Mohammed Ghazni and Mughals. They are both foreign invaders. But Ghazni came here to loot and go back. Mughals came, captured, and stayed here and contributed a lot. So did many people who ever came to India. Including Aryans, they all came from outside stayed and contributed things back.<p>Apart from native Dravidians everybody else came to India and stayed here through some form of wars and conquering. But many of those stayed here.<p>Many looted and went back to their native lands. British just belong to Ghazni kind of invaders who went back.",1341809678

4216743,comment,4216536,4216651,2,0,rsanchez1,,,"As far as I can tell, it sets up a National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) Communications Executive Committee. Section 3 gives you the most important information. Section 3.2 tells you who forms part of the committee, and 3.3 tells you the responsibilities of the committee. In short, its responsibilities are to ensure that communications are available within the government through all emergencies (I would guess they want to protect against an EMP attack, since such an attack would disable major communications systems), and the committee will work with industry (I would guess wireless carriers, ISPs, and other communications companies) to protect communications systems.<p>I can see why the submitter would think its an ominous event. The submitter could be wary of anything justified in the name of national security. The submitter can also interpret this as a response to Russian nuclear-capable bombers intercepted off the west coast twice in the past couple of weeks, which is reportedly a Russian response to US missile defense shields in Europe. Some speculate that this is Putin testing Obama on national security, and the submitter could speculate that this order would be a response to Putin, which is indicative of cooling relations between Russia and the US.<p>Of course, nuclear bombers don't need to drop a bomb on a city to cause widespread destruction. Detonation high in the atmosphere would wreak havoc on all communications through the resulting EMP. It could be as damian2000 suggests, the government's response to the threat of cyber-warfare, but the presence of language such as ""Continuity of Government"" in the order suggests they are planning for much larger emergencies.",1341809651

I'm not sure it's a totally accurate portrayal of India itself. I spent six months backpacking around India. A lot of what he said in the article resonated with me, especially eventually losing it about a few dollars with a taxi driver, hands shaking with anger over $4.<p>The thing the author doesn't mention is that being a traveler affects what you see and who you meet. There are places you go as a backpacker: Agra, Rajasthan, Bodhgaya, Goa, Bangalore and so on.  And there are people there looking for you, expecting you, or at least someone like you.  If you only speak to people who approach you, then you will meet a lot of dishonest people.  Things tend to look pretty rough from the banana pancake store.<p>This is true in any poor country that gets a lot of wealthy tourists.  Most of what he said was true in East Africa too.  It's really true of anywhere you can get that damn banana pancake.<p>So, I don't disagree.  It was spot on.  But it's also possible that the 100% accurate description of what a backpacker sees in India is not an accurate description of India itself.<p>Also, I'm not advocating ""getting off the beaten path"" or trying to critique the ""authenticity"" of his ""Indian experience"".

4216706,comment,4216227,4216227,14,0,bane,,,"I remember reading about Cyc when I was a kid, thinking it was pretty cool. I remember reading breathless articles with emotional quotes from the system where it asked existential questions like ""am I alive?"". I grew up with Sci-Fi, Video Games and Anime where the protagonist had an AI that did all sort of wonderful things for them. I'm by default a <i>fan</i> of the Cyc project and cheer a little whenever I see anything about Cyc.<p>So this is not meant to take anything away from the folks who work on (Open)Cyc, but I think it's time to ask some hard questions about this kind of AI approach:<p>Cyc (open or otherwise) is about 30 years old and has yet to demonstrate any sort of serious advancement over other, much lower friction approaches (actually it's hard to find utility at all). My personal feeling is that it represents a failed approach. This is not the same as a failure, it was a very important experiment that tried to answer the question (paraphrasing the WP article), ""is it possible to craft an AI that can perform human-like reasoning using an ontology of common sense knowledge?"" I think after 30 years the result has been an interesting curiosity, but the answer is a pretty strong ""no"".<p>There are more important questions though. Let's say that OpenCyc represents 30% of the state goal -- and since the goal from the WP page is a bit nebulous let's refine it and say 30% to the reasoning capacity of a 6-8 year old human child (6-8YOHC). And let's say that miracle upon miracles, Cyc is able to move closer to that goal at a steady 1% per year...and after 70 more years Cyc is now as smart as a 6-8YOHC. Is this desirable? I mean, is this a good thing to have? I don't mean this question to come from a source of deep philosophy or moralistic questions...but have you ever tried to get a 6-8YOHC to do any task more complex then follow a few simple instructions with lots of supervision (even getting personality and desires of the child out of the way)? A digital 6-8YOHC measured just on intelligence <i>might</i>, just <i>might</i>, be smart enough to follow a simple question like ""find me news articles about the Libor scandal"". But is that worthwhile? Is 100 years of R&D to achieve this useful?<p>The approach in the past was to not tackle the general purpose problems the Cyc was always meant to but to focus the approach on specific problem sets and build ""expert systems"". This is apparently what the (limited) list of use-cases Cyc is being applied towards is. This again means that Cyc has failed. ""Common sense"" knowledge means ""general purpose"" a 6-8YOHC knows as much about terrorism or biomedicine as it does about car engines...in other words it should perform equally well on any of those things because none of those things are ""common sense"". ""It's hot outside so I shouldn't wear a winter coat"" is a common sense thing.<p>So what are we left with? We're back to ontologies and various flavors of knowledge management and reasoning systems, all of which in my experience are faddish cover terms for the kind of AI research which just didn't go anywhere and haven't demonstrated much more than adding an interesting aside to what were already pretty darn good search results in my favorite search engine when I go to hunt down showtimes for a movie I want to see.<p>The number of dead, dying and useless Semantic Graph projects that are out in the world are astonishing. The lack of any real useful tools built with them is even more astonishing. And I don't mean tools that let you inspect the Knowledge Base (very exciting stuff like e.g. ""is President Obama in the Knowledge Base? What is he connected to?"") which I guess are useful sort of search engines in some contexts where the information is impossibly well curated (e.g. wikipedia). But I mean things like automated teachers, digital accurate diagnosticians, AIs that write good Pop Songs and hold interviews with the entertainment press, <i>anything</i> that <i>might</i> represent intelligence. It seems like whenever some of the pieces of these things show up (WP, Khan Academy, etc.) they are eschewing the direction that Semantic Research is taking us and going with a lower friction, higher payoff route. Why isn't there an AI that can suck in WP and Project Gutenberg and then generate and give me Khan academy lessons for K-12?  Or at the very least provide NPCs in a game that are capable of having at least a 6-8YOHC level of conversation.<p>The answer has always been ""wait till we add more objects/entities/facts/assertions/things/stuff/etc."". This is a bad answer, and unfortunately is the one that challengers to this approach get served back to them. Feeding ""stuff"" into a model and waiting for the spark of life to kick in just doesn't seem to be cutting it.

  f = f
</code></pre>
Type-level recursion works, even without explicit term-level recursion:<p><pre><code>  data T a b = C (T a b -> (a -> b))
  
  q :: T a b -> (T a b -> (a -> b))
  q (C f) = f

  w :: T a b -> (a -> b)
  w x = (q x) x

  f :: a -> b
  f = w (C w)
</code></pre>
This is basically encoding Russell's paradox at the type level. You can write out f explicitly, just so that it doesn't look like you might somehow still be applying w to itself recursively:<p><pre><code>  g :: a -> b
  g = (\x -> ((\(C f) -> f) x) x) (C (\x -> ((\(C f) -> f) x) x))

Please do not seek to describe my own culture back to me with Wikipedia.</i><p>Well, Americans e.g. are pointed to Wikipedia (or other sources) for falsehoods they believe about America all the time. And most of the time, Wikipedia is right and they are wrong. Being a national or resident of some country doesn't mean you are always correct about it (or even that you are EVER correct: Glenn Beck followers come to mind). So let's stick it to the facts and numbers and point to sources and/or arguments.<p>That said, while I agree about the general ""cultural imperialism"" of Shenism, the gist wasn't it, but that Buddhism is not THE prevalent religion in China. Which you agree with as far as I can see.<p>><i>My contention is the marriage as practiced in China is not primarily a religious event.</i><p>Nowadays it might not be. But wasn't that the case in USSR too, when religion was frowned upon? (Not that PRC is that kind of stuck up nowadays, but from what I've read about the Cultural Revolution a lot of things got a remake).<p>Wikipedia, again, gives these ""mythological origins"" of Chinese marriage:<p>The story about the marriage of Nwa and Fu Xi, who were once sister and brother respectively, told about how they invented proper marriage procedures after becoming married. At that time the world was unpopulated, so the siblings wanted to get married but, at the same time, they felt ashamed. So they went up to Kunlun Shan and prayed to the heavens. They asked for permission for their marriage and said, ""if you allow us to marry, please make the mist surround us."" The heavens gave permission to the couple, and promptly the peak was covered in mist. It is said that in order to hide her shyness, Nwa covered her blushing face with a fan. Nowadays in some villages in China, the brides still follow the custom and use a fan to shield their faces.<p>><i>Or perhaps, alternatively, marriage in China is primarily a cultural institution, where religious motifs are applied, removed, and changed over millenia to suit the religious mores of its time?</i><p>Well, that happens in the west too, but we're talking origins here. At the time the ceremony/idea was established, not even Buddhism or Taoism was available, but folk and pagan religions were.

Programme on the Dripping Cross<p>A general Observation: The official Church is slow to attribute
supernatural causes to extra-ordinary phenomena we observe in life.
As far as possible, the Church tries to see if such phenomena can be
explained by natural causes. Further, the Church does not pay too
much attention to these extraordinary phenomena, even though she
accepts the possibility that God may intervene in human life in an
extraordinary way  what we often term a miraculous way.<p>Coming to the dripping Cross at Irla: One can doubt if this water
dripping has a supernatural cause. The Church has NOT made any
pronouncement on it. There is a lengthy scientific process that has to
be undergone before any official pronouncement is made. It is quite
possible that the dripping water may have a natural explanation.<p>What is surely objectionable are the statements made by the Delhi
interlocutor, Mr. Sanal. We point out some of these erroneous
assertions:<p> Contrary to the interlocutors claim, the Church does not advocate
the worship of images. There is a difference between honouring a
thing and making it divine, something to be worshipped. We respect and
honour the Scriptures of any religion not because the books are in
themselves divine, but because they have a special significance for
the adherents of that religion. We honour a cross because it is for us
a reminder of the love of Jesus who died for us<p> A second gratuitous assertion is that the dripping Cross has been
created by priests who are out to make money! This Cross is not on
Church property and the one who is alleged to have noticed the
dripping water was not even a Catholic. To the best of our knowledge,
no money has been collected by any priest. And surely, priests do not
build churches with such money, as is claimed by the interlocutor.<p> A third unwarranted statement is that the Pope or the Church is
against Science. The interlocutor would only have to go to Wikipedia,
the free encyclopedia on the internet, to see the list of eminent
Catholic scientists and how the Church has supported scientific
research since the emergence of the European universities in the
Middle Ages. There is a Pontifical Academy of Sciences, founded in
1603, which seeks to pay honour to pure science, wherever it is found,
to assure its freedom and to promote its research.<p>I realize that the interlocutor has made these and other unwarranted
statements out of ignorance  he is unaware of facts. The least he
could do would be to apologize to the Catholic community for hurting
it, even though it might be inadvertently.<p>+ Bishop Agnelo Gracias

In return he asks me to put my hand forward. For a moment I thought he will give me the money back. But he gives me a black stone and tells me I going to be lucky by next Friday.<p>I plan to throw away the stone, and I don't generally take things like that. He comes back after 10 minutes and asks me to give 100 bucks so that we can go back and do mystic work. Now I realize this is just and elaborate plan by this guy to go back and smoke grass. So I refuse, He asks me return the 'black stone' and nevertheless thanks me for the 5 bucks.<p>On top of this my mom says, Its good he took the stone back, as it would have contained a Harry Potter 'Imperious curse' kind of magic.

Then you wouldn't have to go to court. The only drawback to that would be that, if the pattern seen with auto insurance is any indication, everyone's costs would be higher--auto insurance is significantly more expensive for everyone in states with no-fault insurance laws.

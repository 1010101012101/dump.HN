I think a lot of college kids fool themselves into thinking what they do during college doesn't matter; they'll start anew and turn over a new leaf when they graduate and ""adult life begins"".  It doesn't work, those sorts of rationalizations are similar to New Year's Resolutions, which also don't work.

It may be so easy to buy them that we are developing backlogs, but that is a problem of self control.<p>There is a ton to read on the web right now. The current solution is to use a service like Instapaper, Readability, or Pocket that saves articles and renders them in a pleasurable format to read later. If you want that built into the browser, look no further than Safari which introduced ""Reading List"" in version 5.0 (the new version in Mountain Lion has offline reading as well). Opera has also announced they will have a feature like this in their next major release.<p>There's always room for disruption. Firefox used customizability and standards compliance to disrupt IE's market. A few short years later Chrome used speed to disrupt IE and Firefox's market to become the most used browser in he world.

I was merely stating that Linus is starting to come across as an old bitter programmer who hates everyone and everything. It's pretty unprofessional for a guy of his stature and influence to go on these ranting tirades, professionals don't air their disdain for things publicly unless there is a valid reason, he just comes across as a jerk regardless of whether or not he's earned the right to do so, it's unprofessional.<p>If he's project manager for Linux, why was he surprised that that the Linux core is getting bloated? If he's a project manager, shouldn't he be managing the team to unbloat the operating system? I'd hardly call flaming your own team and operating system a contribution. Nothing about this makes me angry, Linus is a genius and he knows it which is why it frustrates me to see a guy like him resort to sometimes school yard words and ways of dealing with things.<p>Linux itself has already been through what Google has, remember the whole Microsoft debacle? Regardless of the verdict, pretty much every software company that has felt threatened by Linux I'm sure has tried some kind of legal action in some way, shape or form.<p>I earned my right to rant the day I got an internet connection, which was a very long time ago.",1337817141

When he is wrong, he admits it, and seems reasonable about patches that aren't perfect/up to snuff, particularly from newer devs who are trying to do well.

While I can easily annotate, tag or share my clip at creation time, I can also decide to skip all that and just save it with a single click. Personally, when I want to save something, I want that to be as frictionless as possible - I'll think about organizing it later.<p>2) Style - Clips preserve the style of the original content. Whether it's a facebook post, amazon product listing or tweet, your clips retain the look and feel of the original content. I find that to be really helpful when I'm scanning a page of clips - I can quickly recognize lots of pieces of content without reading any text.<p>3) Functionality - Lots of sites let you save a url or an image, but Clipboard clips are full HTML. This means links are active, flash embeds will play inline, text is fully indexed (which is very powerful for recall) etc...<p>4) Granularity of privacy - Clipboard makes it easy to save for yourself, share privately with one or a handful of people (via @ mentions), or publish clips to share them with the world.

It would be a one off damages payment from Google, a complete re-engineering of Android to systematically work around whatever infringement was found, and widescale abandonment and damage to the Java ecosystem and brand.<p>In my opinion Android has provided a lifeline to Java at a time when it was otherwise being abandoned wholesale by the next generation of programmers.  It has kept new, intelligent young people learning the language for long enough for Oracle to bridge the widening gap between Java and other languages with Java7 and hopefully Java8.

We moved them to a 32GB RAM system and gave the container 8GB.<p>As a result, nearly the entire 20GB database (or at least the parts that were needed), got loaded into the disk cache after the first batch of queries were run.

Perhaps it would have flown out of the storm, perhaps it would have descended.<p>I was talking about Qantas Flight 72, not AF447. In the instance of AF447, everything would have been OK if the pilots had done nothing. The airspeeds returned and were valid after ca. 1 minute. But in other scenarios, the plane would likely have crashed if the pilots had done nothing.<p>> Instead they did pretty much the only thing that could doom it: They ascended. This despite knowing they were near the ""coffin corner"" - i.e. the highest safe altitude for the Jet.<p>They could also have descended and risked exceeding the critical Mach speed, which could have broken up the plane.<p>> The pilot clearly panicked and didn't want to crash into the ocean, so he went up, and it was exactly the wrong thing to do.<p>Actually, the standard operating procedure called for a slight nose-up pitch (5 degrees) and maximum continuous thrust.<p>> Your point about pilot inexperience in manual flying, is close. But from what I read it was actually that the pilot was used to the computer taking over and not letting him fly in a dangerous manner, this caused him to try ascend to the point of stalling the plane because he believed the computer would stop him.<p>Exactly (although the pilots did know call out ""alternate law"" and should have known what that meant (no more stall protection).<p>> So you end up with the worst of both worlds: A human who relies on the computer, taking over in a situation with no computer. You have to pick: Either computer all the time, or no computer.<p>The current setup does work very well (given the current safety record of the aviation industry), and looking at GA statistics we'd likely have a more airliner crashes if pilots were hand flying all the time.<p>> This was impossible for both of them.<p>And it would have been just as impossible for the computer. Maybe some time in the future we'll have a computer that will do a better job than humans with dealing with emergencies, and then the autopilots will never need to disconnect for any reason.<p>But until we're there, the original assumption that more automation means that we can get by with less skilled pilots is just wrong.<p>> The windscreen was completely blank, and (some of) the instruments were disabled. Neither the pilot nor the human had any idea what their situation was. What they should have done was remember where they were and assume they were more of less in the same situation.<p>This was a reasonable assumption in this instance, but in other cases it would be the wrong assumption.<p>The big question is what led the pilot to follow the wrong procedure for inconsistent airspeeds, and why they didn't trust the instruments anymore even when they became valid again.

4015794,comment,4015142,4015142,32,0,grellas,,,"Fascinating concept that potentially can work: private arbitration is a matter of contract, there is nothing in law limiting the ability of parties to agree to be legally bound by a determination reached by a private party (i.e., arbitrator) with whom they contract to make such a decision, and the law provides well-established enforcement mechanisms by which arbitration awards can, if necessary, be taken to court and converted into judgments without too much fuss.<p>Judge.me also seems like it has taken a credible first cut at a form of execution that is at least workable. It has avoided the very thorny choice of law issues that can arise where the contracting parties are in different locations by essentially having the parties agree up front to be legally bound by what amounts to a free-floating form of law to be applied by the arbitrator regardless of what technical choice of law issues would normally prescribe. It has avoided the problems that can arise with discovery procedures in arbitration by limiting the whole arbitral process to a 1-day to 3-day exchange of evidence by email exclusively. It has also kept processing costs low by reserving for itself the right to choose and assign the arbitrator, by drawing its arbitrators from an established pool as contractors, and by dispensing with the need for witnesses, transcripts, rules of evidence, and all other technical aspects of judicial hearings (again, the parties agree up front to these limitations and that is why they can be legally bound by them even though they are highly unusual by court standards).<p>What all this means is that this is an innovative way to extend technology to dispute resolution but it will, of course, only appeal to those who can abide by the limitations. To me, this means that the system may lend itself well to small-dollar disputes but not to anything involving complex facts or larger claims. The absence of live testimony and the absence of discovery are particularly limiting in this context - if you can't find out too much about what the adverse party is going to claim and if you can't get your hands on evidence he holds to rebut it, you may be severely prejudiced. At some point not too far up the dollar scale, this likely becomes too risky (this would depend on the individual facts of a case). Beyond this, arbitration generally does not fit too well into non-monetary claims and judge.me would not be an exception to this. Still, for small-dollar cases, it would seem to be an interesting alternative to the small claims court systems in place throughout the U.S. and elsewhere.<p>The big challenge here will be to see how technology can be used to allow the service to overcome some of the limitations noted above while still keeping it streamlined and cost-effective. I am not sure this can be done but this is an interesting first step and there clearly would be a huge demand for cost-effective handling of claims at a higher level. It will be fascinating to see how this develops.",1337814355

I'm really excited that somebody else besides me is advocating the cooperative switching async approach for other languages besides python with greenlet.<p>I've been trying to get something going for JavaScript on top of spidermonkey, but it's been slow going. A few hacks are available in my github. Some of them use spidermonkey's generators to cooperate, and this approach will have the same drawbacks this approach has in python, but this hack with python-spidermonkey and greenlet is pretty sweet:<p><a href=""https://github.com/fzzzy/js-actors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fzzzy/js-actors</a><p>python-spidermonkey is on a really old version of spidermonkey, unfortunately.<p>Also, node-fibers looks totally sweet:<p><a href=""https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers</a><p>Lua has coroutines built in, so I'm guessing this kind of stuff is common there. I haven't used lua much, though.<p>Ruby also has cooperative userland threads that could be used to implement a cooperative async lib. I always wondered why nobody did. I would have, if I had ever decided to get heavily into ruby.",1337814326

4015785,comment,4013292,4015691,2,0,taliesinb,,,"We have two orthogonal tasks which traditional exception mechanisms complect together:<p>1. Handling a failed assumption, which will cause the code that follows to be incorrect (I need the contents of this file to do my task, but it doesn't exist, so I can't do my task)<p>2. Handling a failed operation, which there is a straightforward way of working around (if I can't write to my log file, maybe write to stderr instead instead and give up)<p>The trouble is that the 'inner' code doesn't know which of these a given failure is, because it is context specific. Seems like with languages like Java, the default is 1, whereas with Go it is 2. They're kind of equivalent, though, because you can always convert a !ok into a panic(...).<p>But certainly exceptions are the nuclear option, so it seems reasonable to me that they shouldn't be the default for common operations that can fail.",1337814201

The point I was trying to make was that developing a philosophy behind building a company is not generally considered a strong requirement for most web companies.<p>And if you develop a powerful enough theory for your market, and then build toward that theory rather than arbitrarily building a website with a function, you'll have a higher probably of eventual success.<p>I've seen a lot of companies just fail because there was real driving force behind the product more than ""hey, that'd be cool, I think."" That approach might work sometimes, but I think you can vastly improve your chances by having an underlying prediction for the market you're entering.",1234699143

The general case is people coding (long term projects) during the day and sleeping at night. Hackdays are different and fun! Plus there were prizes.",1234699033
481914,comment,481623,481645,0,0,wim,,,"Actually, what I find interesting is that I see an increasing number of websites make a non-free iPhone application of their site, while the site itself remains free. In the discussion whether or not many '2.0' (yeah, i know..) sites out there will ever be able to make a profit, it seems strange that a fair amount of said websites do not offer a non-free version of their sites as well. People obviously don't mind paying for something they see value in; and the iPhone app might prove that the site's readers actually see value in reading the site. Of course it might just be the ""iPhone effect"" that makes people get used to the fact that software can also have a price tag. Just had to think of this as I remembered a nice anecdote about a forum that started charging money to get rid of spammers and made quite some money as a 'side-effect' ;)
(I actually don't know reddit that well myself, so I don't know if they offer a paid option to see the websites without ads; so it's more a note about free websites in general)",1234698702

481912,comment,481880,481880,0,0,swombat,,,"Meh.<p>It's a nice theory, but it's not particularly useful to someone who wants to start a business, or who is already starting a business. We make and test theories about the future in all our human endeavours - not just entrepreneurship. Even going on a date is testing a hypothesis about the future.<p>So, in summary, this article is correct about the human decision process, but incorrect in the implicit assumption that this is something specific to entrepreneurship.",1234698039
481911,comment,433101,434279,0,0,aposteriori,,,"Fink/ports work enough, but like I said it doesn't integrate with the OS like on Debian/Ubuntu. I've already mentioned the issue of clashing versions (gcc from Fink vs from Apple, etc.)<p>But OS X is nice, if only Ubuntu and Linux in general had the drivers, the overall polish, better menus (System Preferences on OS X are nice, on gnome they are a dog's breakfast) and dropped the ugly brown theme...<p>I think I'll stick to Mac laptops and Linux desktops and enjoy the best of both worlds :)",1234697897

481905,comment,481882,481884,0,0,alnayyir,,,"He's right you know. Especially if you consider how much easier it is becoming to accomplish the non-trivial in the latest programming languages like ruby, eventually, programming itself won't be a career anymore, it'll be an added-value skillset, and eventually, a common skill.<p>That's why I'm a reverse engineer and systems programmer. :D<p></advertisement>",1234695804
481904,comment,481211,481428,0,0,teyc,,,"sooner or later, China would have to bring trade back into equilibrium. The purpose of debt is to have it repaid one day. This can only be when Chinese are willing to pay for U.S. goods. This can be either when both countries enjoy some kind of parity.<p>This is not as far fetched as it sounds. The savings rate of Chinese Gen X'ers are 0. They are voracious consumers. If Chinese goverment decided to fund local debt instead of foreign debt, U.S. manufacturing could conceivably come back and sell into China in the future.",1234695758

How about those of us who think that its the killer feater? I've been disassembling and tinkering with things since i was 4 years old. List of things i've broken while messing with them as a child: a turntable, 3 tape players, most of my toys. My favorite toy was duck tape and wires, because at 6 i still haven't learned to solder and that was the way i connected batteries to motors, lights switches(all taken from broken toys).<p>This is the type of person i am, so are a lot of HN users. Computers are like crack for us. Here is a machine that can do everything i imagine, no force can get me away from my pc, it is my playground. I've broken my Linux install countless times(before i started using linux, i did the same with Windows) i mess with everything, hell, im addicted to this.<p>Why does apple think we are some sort of barbarians with no taste? I get the feeling that they feel that if they give people more control, they will somehow shit all over their egos or something.<p>I mean, i don't want to shit on anybodies ego, but i want to play with stuff. I'm sure the other Steve understands.",1234695731

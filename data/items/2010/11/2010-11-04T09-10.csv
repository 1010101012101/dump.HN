1868272,comment,1864599,1866556,0,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"In terms of incentive to learn, we're talking about maybe $10 for a book.  This is a relatively small amount of money for something which will likely keep the person entertained for several hours over a week or two.  In addition most readers are educated, employed and earn above average which puts them in the class of people where time (to learn these things) is proportionally more important to them than money.  You talk about giving people enough incentive but I really don't see that many people being strongly incentivised to learn by that sort of saving.<p>You're also making the assumption that book X has no substitute and that they must read this but this is rarely the case (and in those situations the item will actually almost always have a higher value to the individual increasing the price they're willing to pay).<p>If I look at the Spy Who Loved Me and I find that it's £5.25 on Amazon and I think that's not a good price, I could easily see that I could get Casino Royale for £4.35.  If I think that's too expensive it would take me about 30 seconds to see that I could get The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo for £2.68 or the Lost Symbol for £2.76.<p>Piracy is not just not the only alternative and indeed I'd suggest that in the vast majority of cases it's not the main alternative.<p>(If you think that £2.68 is too much for a novel then might I ask what the reasonable price is at which you'd buy rather than pirate? My guess would be that it's likely to be in the area where the publisher essentially doesn't see you as a potential customer anyway (at least not a profitable one) and broadly doesn't really care what you do).<p>Beyond this you assume that initial attempts at piracy will be positive where research shows that this isn't the case.  If someone attempts to find a torrent and spends half an hour battering their head against password protected files, dead links and so on, they're just as easy to write the whole thing off.  At that point buying behaviour is actually reenforced as they now longer see downloading as a viable option.<p>As for habits the use of the work ""exhaustive"" to relate to an Amazon search which might take 30 seconds is misleading.  I agree that you're not going to search 50 sites to find the best price but a search on Amazon to get a ballpark figure isn't onerous at all.  Where someone has made some sort of investment in a new behaviour pattern it might be true that it was more of a one way trip but in this case the barrier to returning to legitimate purchasing is so low as to not be there.<p>EDIT:  I would accept that there are some instances where book piracy will be (and is) rife.  Generally these would be where the price is higher (computer or academic books for example) increasing the incentive, and where the potential customer / pirate is more familiar with the technology and therefore the barriers to moving into piracy are lower but for mass market books I don't see it being an issue in the way you describe.",1288863985

1868257,comment,1867974,1868243,0,0,swombat,,,"No, this is symptomatic of a modern economy. Any advanced economy will have a similar focus.<p>If you think about it on a higher level, it makes a lot of sense. At first, the great bottleneck was having enough food, so all economies began with an almost-100% focus on agriculture. But then, as that became less and less of a problem, the next bottleneck was having enough stuff - whether machinery to make agriculture more efficient, or other items to make your life better.<p>As ""stuff"" gets less and less scarce, and cheaper and cheaper to acquire, what are we left with? The final bottleneck, which isn't going away any time soon, is that we all only have 24 hours in a day. ""Services"" is a euphemism for ""ways to buy other people's time so you can have more than 24 hours of 'good time' (and higher 'good time' than you'd be able to achieve by yourself) per day"". Whether that's bank services to speed up your money handling, or cleaning services, or web design services, or any other number of services which basically amount to helping someone, somewhere to make more efficient use of their time.<p>This is the final bottleneck until we figure out how to speed up our thoughts, and so all activity ends up piling into there.",1288863226

1868255,comment,1867719,1867719,0,0,oemera,,,"Lately these questions and discussions are everywhere and most times I think people are missing the point: it's all about code you want to write.<p>We created all those high level languages to make code easy to read, to make them people understand. I mean you could probably write your website in Assembla but the language won't help you to write down what you really want.<p>As a developer you are trying to develop something you do not want to mess around with a language. The language you use should help you focus on what you want to develop not distracting you with ""ugly"" code.<p>If you understand what the code is doing (even if you coded it on your own you sometimes have to think about what is going on there) it lets you help to focus on your goals.<p>If you brain works better with PHP code you should probably use PHP as your coding language but if not you should try something else like Python, Ruby or maybe Haskel until you find a language which is boosting you while developing.
Don't get me wrong I don't say a programming language should do everything for you while you are drinking coffee. No, it should help you to think better what to implement next and how to implement it. 
It should support you while reading and understanding.<p>Again, we only created all those high level languages to make it easier to understand.<p>And now my standpoint to PHP: 
I don't like PHP cause it is a noisy language IMO.
PHP is not OOP. You can use OOP in PHP 5 but the PHP core is not OOP so this seems weird. Even in PHP 5 you can't get  a string length like: $str->length
No you have to use strlen($str) and this is ugly.<p>Also I don't like those ""symbols"" PHP is using (maybe symbols are not the correct word here but I can't find a better fitting word at the moment).
In PHP you have variable names with a $ symbol.
Why? I don't know but this doesn't work for human beings cause human brains are assuming the dollar symbol has something to do with money or numbers but in PHP it's not. So you have to getting used to it.<p>It's really the same with the ""dot"" symbol in PHP. You wouldn't expect that it's concatenating strings.<p>Ruby as language is for me like reading a book. 
For example you can write code like this:
if user.has_comments?
   ...
end<p>That's why I love Ruby and I would prefer working with RoR for my project cause it helps you on rapid development.<p>One last thing: Ruby lets your focus on what you want to build without noise that's why (IMO) there are so much gems and a really huge community!<p>(Sorry for my bad english, it's not my primary language. I'm working on it :)<p>EDIT: corrected some typos.",1288863078

Believe me: most of the people who suddenly has to do data analysis for their phd or postdoc projects hardly know how to use excel, so easy of use is essential.<p>Also, you want a non compiled language. Most of the time you do interactive programming and change parameters on the fly, according of the result of the analysis.<p>Finally, matplotlib, one of python's most complete graphic library, is a breeze to use. Making graphs in an interactive way with java or .net is simply impossible.<p>I am a neuroscientist and most people in the field use Matlab. I use python (in fact I use ONLY open source software, by choice). It's amazing how many advantages python gave me on my daily life.",1288861707

I think you might be making the same mistake he was calling out: assuming the other side hasn't put any thought into their argument.  Sometimes they haven't but sometimes, despite how radical the position may sound, they have put work into it.",1288861445

1868217,comment,1867091,1867091,0,0,chops,,,"My sport of choice is beach volleyball (2v2). My problem is that I'm wildly obsessive - so instead of just going out there and playing volleyball for a couple hours, then heading home to work, I stay at the beach for 5-6 hours, and after that I'm completely spent.  And then the next day, if it's mildly nice, I'll just head back to the beach because I'm completely obsessed with improving my game.<p>I'm finding that late fall is doing wonders for my productivity, since the beach is colder now (but damn nice for Wisconsin November), I'll only spend 2-3 hours down there once or twice a week, rather than 6-7 hours 4-5 times a week (summer schedule).<p>But I do recommend picking up a sport.  Good exercise and doesn't feel like a waste of time, the way lifting does (though I do try to do lifting to improve my game, even if it's boring as watching grass grow).",1288861401

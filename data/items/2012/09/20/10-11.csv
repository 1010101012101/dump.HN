Thing is, glass, and especially tinted or ""specially treated"" glass meant for display purposes, are very very hard to render beforehand. Actually, it's very difficult to tell how the glass actually looks until it starts coming out of the factory to be hung up.<p>My fear with tinted glass is that it often appears darker than intended. A lot of the tinted glass in NYC, although colorful enough up-close, becomes dulled a mile or more away.<p>But we'll have to see how this one turns out. Each glass curtain wall is different. Unique, like a snowflakes (if that's even true).",1348138773

Because all these screw ups provide incentives for developers and other companies to stay in the game and compete with Apple.

What platforms will the Angry Birds and Instagrams of the future build on first if it costs $250k in marketing get noticed on the App Store? Maybe Apple doesn't give a shit about that and is content to milk its money farm for all its worth, to hell with the long term consequences.

4547867,comment,4532922,4541930,1,0,lmm,,,"Obviously if your report makes assumptions about your data which aren't true then you might get invalid data out. I absolutely agree with having a single point through which writes to the data store must pass which enforces business-level constraints on the data. I just don't find SQL a convenient form to express those constraints (and my experience has been that any given business domain will have some constraints that are too complex to express in the SQL model, forcing you to resort to e.g. triggers - at which point the constraint is not integrated with the rest of your data model, it's just a piece of code that runs to check your inserts, which you could do equally well in any language); I'd rather do it in a ""normal"" programming language.<p>I see what you're getting at with reporting now, you're talking about doing actual calculations on the data? For mongodb I'd probably use its map-reduce API, at which point you're writing javascript and you can do anything, and performance should be fine. Though honestly other than performance I've never had a problem with just fetching the rows I need and doing whatever transformation/aggregation logic in e.g. python. SQL has never struck me as particularly typesafe or gaining much advantage from being close to the data; its sets-oriented way of thinking can be helpful in some places, but it's not the only language that can do that.<p>If you like SQL as a language for writing logic in I can see why a traditional database would appeal. But even then I feel like input validation, data storage and query processing should be separate layers (and I see some movement towards that with e.g. MySQL offering an interface to do key/value lookups directly). If SQL is a good way of doing transform/aggregation logic then it should stand alone, and I'd expect to see SQL-like query layers on top of key-value stores.",1348136520

Apple does the compilers, and the bolt-on distributions (brew, Macports, fink) seem to have trouble keeping things compatible. Linux distributions don't end up falling behing their own compilers every time the compiler gets updated.<p>Seem to? From first hand experience, while MacPorts shows its age and cruft, homebrew just rocks. I just recently upgraded a SL+XCode 4.2 machine to ML+XCode 4.5. Zero issues. The only problem is old or broken software that assumes C == GCC in some way (e.g ruby 1.8). I've had more  although infrequent  problems with ArchLinux updating to latest GCC.",1348136514

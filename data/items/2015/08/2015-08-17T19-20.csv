I am really impressed at what a good job the Netflix team has done with introducing the json graph concepts, I&#x27;ve learned a lot it regardless of falcor.  Kudos Netflix!<p>I really like the concepts and client/server model.  If it is performant, it will be fun to see persistent videogame worlds written through falcor.  To that end, would it be possible/effective to hang parts of the graph off of WeakMap so that big, not recently used parts of the graph are allowed to fall away?  (Perhaps that is how it works right now, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to look at the source code, pardon my ignorance...)",1439841575

10075688,comment,10073578,10075344,0,0,igravious,,,"10 minutes into the Rich Hickey video and I can see why you responded to me with a link to it. This is indeed what I&#x27;m getting at; so many languages use fundamentally the same underlying logical and state model. Rich mentions single-dispatch, stateful OO. To that I would add boolean logic. Our systems or so riven by it we don&#x27;t even see it. And I reckon it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way! I can totally see why Eve is written in Rust from the 10 minutes of this talk that I&#x27;ve seen, and I can see that it is the incidental complexity of managing the lifetime of objects in your head in C++ that have forced this shift. Or, as per Hickey, Clojure-wards.<p>Still though, both Rust and Clojure, both presume an omnipresent bivalent atemporal logical discourse. If you&#x27;re working on a different logic (or sets of logic?) in Eve then why not make them dynamically user-selectable at run-time in an intuitive manner :) Granted, I have _no earthly idea_ in practise what this means but when you reflect on how humans manipulate concepts internally you see that we have the machinery for this built into us -- or learnt somehow at a very early age. Tapping into this fluid logical apparatus would be ever so neat.",1439841451

Do you routinely judge if a person tells the truth based on some words he used?<p>Also, you confuse the GP&#x27;s feelings about the situation right now with his attitude back then. Back when it happened, he didn&#x27;t know of a 3 months long plot against him. Now he does know. He was shown the (<i>obscenity censored because it would apparently alter the meaning of my post</i>) documents, he read it black on white. Just before getting fired, too. It&#x27;s nothing strange that his wording now is emotional and blunt, it says nothing about how he was back then.<p>Lastly, of course, there are polite ways of telling people to <i>censored, you know why</i> off politely. It&#x27;s what assertiveness is all about. There are people, however, who don&#x27;t really care about the form: they just can&#x27;t stand others disagreeing with them. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that rare a trait. How about that line of thinking:<p>&quot;He&#x27;s too polite, he&#x27;s trying to hide something. And he dared to disagree with me, his superior. More than once! I don&#x27;t have the time to deal with a time-bomb like him, which can blow up behind my back at any time. I need an army of easily controlled people to help me further my career.

I&#x27;ll speak from the point of view of Lojban, as I know it better, but the fork doesn&#x27;t fall far from the root so it should all mostly apply to Loglan as well.<p>Essentially, Lojban and Esperanto come from different intentions: Esperanto wanted to be a common tongue that speakers of various natural languages could learn relatively easily and use for multicultural communications. Loglan and Lojban were started as experimentation around the &quot;Strong&quot; Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that language influences mental structure. The goal of these languages was then to see if people used a language with more formal mathematical rigidity/&quot;logic&quot; to it might more easily &quot;think&quot; as better mathematicians. The jury is still out, of course, on whether any of these languages actually do what they set out to do.<p>Essentially, the concept of Lojban/Loglan is kind of a &quot;What if people actually spoke a natural language that was very similar to a programming language?&quot; (Loglan actually predates most programming languages, and Lojban incorporated some things from programming languages over time.)<p>From that respect, the grammar of Lojban is stringently less complex than most natural grammars (and Esperanto). There&#x27;s an official PEG [Parsing Expression Grammar] specification of Lojban these days and Lojban has worked very hard to keep the language grammar Context-Free (in the Chomsky&#x27;s Hierarchy/Computational Parsing sense). The language&#x27;s grammar is much more like a programming language than a natural language.<p>As for the consonant clusters, even the morphology of the words follows a fairly strict parsing pattern. For the most part when reading Lojban/Loglan you only need to pronounce three letters at a time. (This is part of the play in the name LOGical LANguage of the three letter syllable pattern in the language itself. Lojban uses the language&#x27;s own symbols in its case.)<p>Is there a benefit to Loglan or Lojban over Esperanto? Ultimately I think it&#x27;s a matter of whether or not there is a benefit of Apples over Oranges: it&#x27;s more a matter of your particular taste and what you want out of a conlang.

It was a terrible mistake by IBM, because they essentially eliminated the next generation of mainframers. They&#x27;ve since come to their senses with a program called the IBM Academic Initiative [0] which promotes the use of mainframes in Computer Science courses. It&#x27;s only about 20 years too late.<p>But I think they could do a better job. Up until recently, the only way to try z/OS without accessing million dollar hardware was to break the law. You literally had to torrent a pirated copy of z/OS. And it&#x27;s not easy to find. A few years ago, IBM changed this with their tool: Rational Developer and Test for System z [1]. It&#x27;s essentially Hercules but you get a legal copy of z/OS. And it&#x27;s $9500 per year per CPU. And there is some stupid hardware license usb key.<p>And regarding your questions, your points are valid. Vendor lock-in is a concern. IBM is the only player in the business, and they know it. But look at every major industry that&#x27;s been around at least 30 years: all the mission critical stuff runs on a mainframe. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the only thing that runs their legacy COBOL code. But it works and it&#x27;s rock solid.<p>The poster child of migrating to Linux on z is Nationwide. They successfully moved almost all of their x86 processing to Linux on z and saved a ton of money. There&#x27;s the definitely-not-vendor-biased white paper out there.

As a practicing corporate and IP attorney (which I am as well), you should pretty well know nobody uses it that way, not even courts.  There are such things as at-will employment agreements.  You are correct that non-fixed duration employment contracts are generally at-will, but that does not make them any less of employment agreements. If you do not believe you can make an at-will employment agreement, i don&#x27;t know what to even tell you.
Would you like me to cite 50 cases that disagree with you?
:)<p>All employment is by contract, and all these contracts are employment agreements, whether they are implied contracts (which is what most at-will employment is, for sure), collective bargaining agreements, explicit negotiated agreements, or whatever.  I can make a verbal at-will agreement too! It&#x27;s still an employment agreement.<p>It is true that, in for example, california, labor code specifies at-will employment as the default employment relationship without a contract, but that does not mean if you have a written contract you cannot be at-will, or you cannot have an employment agreement (most of the written employment agreements that are at-will make you explicitly agree you are at will and cover a salary.  These are very clearly employment agreements, as they cover your employment status and terms of your employment, etc).  It also doesn&#x27;t mean a verbal agreement wouldn&#x27;t overcome that default.<p>But I guess if we fundamentally disagree on terminology, we aren&#x27;t getting to space today.",1439840306

The combination of the mainframe architecture&#x27;s strengths with Linux&#x27;s API/ecosystem could be pretty awesome. Anyone wondering why buy a mainframe should focus on these areas:<p>1. Reliability. Some have gone 30 years without downtime. Probably strongest selling point.<p>2. Channel I/O [1]: dedicated I/O processors plus scheduling that lead to high utilization (80-90+%) and throughput vs commodity servers. Second strongest point in mainframe&#x27;s favor. I wish my desktop & servers had this rather than a knockoff.<p>3. Hardware partitioning that&#x27;s more robust and rated at stronger security than most virtualization. Certain cutting-edge projects in INFOSEC are doing similar things at CPU and I/O layers. Mainframe&#x27;s version, although not as cool, is decent and field-proven.<p>4. Built-in, proven software virtualization.<p>5. Hardware acceleration for some things such as databases and crypto.<p>6. IBM&#x27;s ecosystem of apps, third-party providers, and services. This might matter to existing IBM customers.<p>So, those are a few advantages I hear from people who use mainframes. The z/OS-based mainframes have extra benefits in terms of software reliability, security through obscurity (obfuscation), and seemingly better use of both security (eg memory key) and functional (eg decimal) aspects of mainframe processors. The z/VM product has also been doing for decades what modern virtualization systems only recently do, even self-virtualizing since 70&#x27;s.<p>So, there&#x27;s some things to ponder. Whether it makes since financially vs other setups is a whole, different discussion. However, mainframes do retain strong, technical advantages over commodity architectures. They were doing cloud in one box before it was a thing. Their reliability is still unmatched with only VMS clusters and NonStop architecture getting close. So, it&#x27;s a sensible choice for a business to spend extra $$$ to get high-throughput with no downtime and strong isolation of logical partitions.<p>Channel I/O [1]

That plus the fact that the system is reliable, low-maintenance, etc. preserves the status quo, despite the fact that if you were to write the same applications today, you&#x27;d choose a newer platform because it would be more cost-effective.<p>As such, IBM has historically offered z/Linux and co-processors only to hold onto data and processing that was being pulled off of the mainframe because it was too expensive/too onerous to do on the mainframe using z/OS and the like. So customers, unable to completely shut down their mainframe, could kind of make the best of a bad situation and at least get some cheaper Linux cycles out of their expensive iron.<p>If the above is true (and correct me if it&#x27;s not) what is the appeal of a Linux-only mainframe?

10075331,comment,10071814,10074696,0,0,aus_,,,"It&#x27;s hard to answer &quot;z/OS vs Linux on z&quot; generically, because there&#x27;s use cases for both. But perhaps the most generic answer I can give you in favor of Linux is: familiarity.<p>z/OS has a long history. It&#x27;s predecessor, OS/390, dates back to the 1990s. Before OS/390, there was OS/360 which dates back to the 60s. Back then, IBM was first to market on business computer processing. (That was the only computer processing.) Major industries, like financial, insurance, and airlines, poured their infrastructure into mainframes, because it was the only name in the game. IBM prides itself in assuring its customers that the COBOL code that ran your business back in the 80s will still run today on z/OS 2.1 (the current version of z/OS). Chances are, when you swipe your credit card, that transaction touches a mainframe and probably some code that was written in the 1980s. Or earlier. I know, because I&#x27;ve seen the timestamps.<p>This compatibility is really evident when you use z/OS. The green screen is perhaps the most obvious example. When you see a systems programmer (that&#x27;s mainframe-talk for sysadmin) debugging a system, you&#x27;ll see them page through a really archaic, unsexy TN3270 interface. Why? The same reason Unix (and thereby Linux) uses teletype. Because that&#x27;s what the operating system was built on.<p>Sure. z/OS has Unix System Services. In fact, it&#x27;s even POSIX compliant. But can you `apt-get install ruby`?. No. There&#x27;s no Ruby for z/OS (unless you count JRuby). There&#x27;s no package manager for USS. It&#x27;s just plain, vanilla Unix. There&#x27;s no new open source contributions. There&#x27;s no Bash that comes with the operating system. You get a 10 year old version of Shell. There&#x27;s all kinds of shenanigans with SCP/SFP and ASCII/EBCDIC. IBM has to maintain the tools. (Actually, it&#x27;s been turned over to Rocket Software.) It feels very &quot;round peg, square hole&quot;.<p>So z/OS has an image problem. IBM made a huge mistake back in the mid-80s. When commodity x86 PCs became available, universities realized they could teach their computer science programs on cheaper hardware instead of expensive mainframes. Compute Science is platform agnostic, right? What IBM didn&#x27;t do is recognize this as a problem. They didn&#x27;t give out free mainframes to universities, so schools quit teaching with them. How many people do you know under 30 that had a mainframe-based curriculum? And for the self-taught, how are you suppose to learn the basics of a platform if costs millions of dollars? Anybody can install Linux on their $100 laptop in a few hours. But mainframes?<p>Fast-forward a couple of decades and now you have a talent pool that&#x27;s extremely saturated with x86 people. And the mainframe people? Well, they are all retiring and there aren&#x27;t many replacements. Second-generation mainframers are far and few. (I&#x27;m one of them.)<p>So let&#x27;s say you have a new workload. It&#x27;s undeveloped. What platform should you choose? There&#x27;s probably not many technical reasons why you could not accomplish what you want to do in z/OS. But how many people do you know that consider themselves proficient with debugging z/OS? Outside of &quot;dead languages&quot;, your options are pretty much limited to Java. (There&#x27;s a few exceptions to this, but Java is the biggest modern language player.) But that&#x27;s not to say there isn&#x27;t any new development happening in the z/OS space. There&#x27;s plenty of new workloads coming to WebSphere on z because porting a WebSphere application could be pretty easy. There&#x27;s also performance benefits when you are on the same system where all your financial records are stored. z/OS is definitely an option, but it varies by use case.<p>With Linux on z, you get real Linux. And the majority know Linux. The majority can debug Linux. And you get the same benefits of being on rock-solid mainframe hardware and you get memory-speed I/O against mainframe data and services through a special networking interface called Hipersockets. Mainframes are also pretty good a virtualization, because they invented it. (z/VM has it&#x27;s roots dating back to the 70s.)",1439838128

Perhaps necessary to the mood, I submit he skipped over the hard part.<p>The loneliness of leadership, to me, is quite different from solitude. I have felt most lonely when I&#x27;m most busy. It&#x27;s a sense that there&#x27;s no one left to help. You&#x27;ve delegated everything you can, you&#x27;ve set aside everything you can, and still the work keeps coming in, often from people who depend on you, not necessarily outside sources. This is where you realize maybe you overcommitted on a few things and you start wondering if maybe the straights got it right: maybe pursuing that new idea wasn&#x27;t worth it. Just keep things going.<p>That&#x27;s when you realize this leadership gig is harder than it looks. In your office at 1 am on Sunday when there&#x27;s no one else. Maybe Steve Jobs wasn&#x27;t so crazy calling people at oh-dark-thirty.<p>By comparison, solitude has come to me almost as a reward, a gift from others who commit to letting me be alone long enough to get some thinking done.",1439838095

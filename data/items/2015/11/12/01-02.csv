10550819,comment,10550523,10550523,0,0,Cogito,,,"My favourite recent addition to Git Rev News is the developer spotlight interviews.<p>This edition&#x27;s spotlight on Matthieu Moy is really interesting, as he talks about some of the changes he has helped implement in git, particularly in the user interface.<p><i>Q: How did you start getting involved with Git?<p>A: My first non-trivial contribution to free software was on version-control, before Git existed. I got involved in GNU Arch, then its fork Bazaar 1.x. And then GNU Arch and Bazaar 1.x died, and I moved on to something else. At the same time, I started teaching version-control, hated centralized systems enough to migrate to Git. Teaching Git in 2009 was a funny experience: the tool was starting to get a decent user-interface, but was lacking a lot of polishing. One of my favorite examples is what happens when you push to a remote that has commits that you don&#x27;t have locally. Initially, users were getting a message like:</i><p><pre><code>    ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)\n</code></pre>\n<i>I wrote a rather straightforward patch to change it to:</i><p><pre><code>    ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)\n    To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected.\n    Merge the remote changes before pushing again.\n    See &#x27;non-fast forward&#x27; section of &#x27;git push --help&#x27; for details.\n</code></pre>\n<i>The students went from &quot;Huh?&quot; to &quot;Wow, a 3-lines long message, that&#x27;s long. What shall I do now (given that reading the actual doc is not an option)?&quot;. Then, I added an explicit mention of &quot;git pull&quot; in the message, and the situation became manageable for most students. Many of my contributions to Git follow this principle: see what users have difficulties with, and try to improve the tool to help them. In many cases, a staightforward patch to improve the error message was sufficient: in case of error, explain what&#x27;s going on to the user, and give the way out (&quot;did you mean: ...?&quot; or &quot;use ... to ...&quot;).</i>",1447293525

10550794,comment,10547575,10547575,0,0,j2kun,,,"I like the message, but I also think it cuts both ways.<p>Take Chicago for example. When I moved to Chicago five years ago, Wicker Park was the &quot;hipster&quot; neighborhood, where many of the exciting cultural events (at least for people in my age group, young 20 somethings) were happening. By the next year, Wicker Park had become too trendy and gentrified, and all the hipsters moved further west to Logan Square. Today Logan Square is too upscale, and the hipsters have moved south into Pilsen, forcing many of the local hispanic families out of the neighborhood because of rising prices. Now there are organic juice bars sprouting up in Pilsen and the gentrification process is starting anew.<p>This is almost exactly the pattern described in the article, except it&#x27;s the people who <i>want</i> authentic communities that are causing the problem! It&#x27;s a catch-22: if you don&#x27;t like your community you can try to go elsewhere, but a few years after you do you will hate your vapid community again. In this case it&#x27;s the drive for culture that causes monoculture. Once something is seen as authentic people flock to it and it becomes trite. How can you deal with that?",1447293171

Perhaps because it&#x27;s naturally the first scheme anyone would come up with, but nonetheless, here&#x27;s what he had to say about it:<p>> A move (apart from castling and pawn promotion) can be specified by giving the original and final squares occupied by the moved piece. each of these squares is a choice from 64, thus 6 binary digits each is sufficient, a total of 12 for the move. Thus the initial move P-K4 would be represented\nby 1, 4; 3, 4. To represent pawn promotion on a set of three binary digits can be added specifying the pieces that the pawn becomes. Castling is described by the king move (this being the only way the king can move two squares). Thus, a move is represented by (a, b, c) where a and b are squares and c specifies a piece in case of promotion.<p>I&#x27;m actually slightly surprised Shannon didn&#x27;t propose a more compact scheme using the lower entropy of legal chess moves, but I guess his purpose in this article was more to do a ballpark estimate of the feasibility of computer chess playing in general.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pi.infn.it/~carosi/chess/shannon.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pi.infn.it/~carosi/chess/shannon.txt</a>",1447292270

We all have heuristics that work pretty well for us generally, and sufficiently clever/prepared people can abuse that.<p>For example, think back to Google Glass. There was a time when it was an amazing revolution about to happen. There are pictures of generally smart, experienced people wearing Google Glass and trying hard to look like the future. [1] How much got spent there? On the glasses alone, figure it was something like 100,000 units at $1500 each for a total of $150m. Google presumably spent a fair bit more on R&D and marketing, and plenty of other companies spent time and money on the platform.<p>Were all those people dumb? I never understood the appeal of Google Glass, so you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d be inclined to say so. But my take is that the people who gave that a go were just working with different heuristics than I am. Lord knows I&#x27;ve bought plenty of disappointing gadgets over the years. As long as we&#x27;re write more often than we&#x27;re wrong, the heuristics aren&#x27;t bad, just not perfect.<p>So here I figure that most of the people who put in money weren&#x27;t idiots; they just had different ways of judging. E.g., a lot of deals happen partly because of trust. But we all know that con men are people who are extremely good at manipulating trust-related heuristics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/04/10/google-launches-glass-collective-with-andreessen-horowitz-kleiner-perkins-to-fund-google-glass-startups/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/04/10/google-lau...</a>",1447291627

I plan to keep right on working in tech. I&#x27;ve worked for farmers. It kind of sucks. I like sitting in a chair and looking at code all day.<p>On that topic let me tell you about farms and farmers. Most farmers are millionaires and were born that way and have only gotten richer in the last decade or so. You have to know what you are doing to turn a profit. Farms are worth a lot of money. Millions. Do you have millions? If not, you get to be some millionaire&#x27;s little peon. You get to make $9 an hour. You don&#x27;t get overtime. You work really hard at certain times of year... 12 hours or more a day. You have to know how to drive a tractor straight. Do you know how to drive a tractor straight? Do you know how to keep a machine maintained? Where the grease fittings are? You better grease it good before you start. Otherwise some overweight red faced drunk with 15 million dollars in assets who considers you a little peon will come out and yell at you. Heck, he might come out and yell at you anyway just for fun. Cause he thinks you are a smarty pants who thinks you are just so smart. He almost certainly isn&#x27;t going to help you along. In fact, if you don&#x27;t have a certain look he almost certainly isn&#x27;t going to hire you in the first place.<p>Oh... that wasn&#x27;t the type of farm you were thinking of? Maybe you were thinking of a hippie type organic farm where you could hang out and smoke weed while casually picking a few tomatoes. Well... say goodbye to your $9 an hour because you won&#x27;t even be making that.<p>If you want to try farming go get on a crew picking chilies or something for a day. They will hire just about anybody. I&#x27;ve done it before. Piece-rate. Cash at the end of the day. $50 if you are lucky and you will barely be able to walk.<p>In short... put down the pipe. Get a grip on reality and sharpen your tech skills. The field may shrink, it definitely will change, but it isn&#x27;t going anywhere.

This doesn&#x27;t change my admiration for Stallman nor does it lessen my respect for his position.<p>My speculation would be that the position is deemed ethical because Stallman&#x27;s view [as I understand it] has always been based on the primacy of freedom for the user. Stallman has not [so far as I am aware, though admittedly I do not approximate a one-eyed king on HN] ever suggested that users should be absolutely prohibited from installing and using non-free software. Only that it not be included under the &quot;Good Houskeeping Seal of Approval&quot;.<p>What Stallman has done here, as elsewhere, is a pair of tasks. One is to carefully define a set of terms and the second is to state his position with respect to those terms. Agree or disagree (and it&#x27;s more important in disagreement I suppose) one can reasonably know more or less exactly what one is agreeing or disagreeing with...e.g. this exactness is the reason that the issue of interoperability as a possible contradiction can be raised and clearly articulated.<p>Stallman speaks absolutely in the sense of clarity. He knows his position and his beliefs. My opinion is that they have perhaps done more to shape the current software ecosystem than anything else. We live in a world where a common moderate position for sober business women is an Apache type license not a 30 day trial binary, cripple ware, or even shareware...let alone something sold by a four-legged meat eating sales team.

It's like saying ""When you go to a restaurant, don't concentrate on how many menu items you order, or on how big the kitchen is. Make sure you get the food you want in a portion size that's big enough.""<p>I mean, ownership is wealth and control -- how can you consider it wealth if you aren't translating it into dollars?",1176400178

12284,comment,12201,12271,0,0,Wintermute,,,"No.  They will not do that.  No good VC would not force you to take a high salary if you would rather the money went into the business.  They'd probably even like that.  A founder should be setting the vision and culture of the company.  Compensation is one piece of that culture.  You set a precedent by taking a big salary and you set a message by taking a small one (i.e. Jet Blue - CEO, COO, CFO each have a base salary of $200,000 / turned down bonuses during bad years).  \n",1176399652

I'm debating whether it means there was something fundamentally wrong with my app or if it's something fixable. I know it's impossible, but I would have really liked to know what was (or wasn't) in my application that caused it to be rejected.",1176399538

Some may just become angel investors and put some cash into startups. But on the whole if google cannot hold back their employees then there may be something to do with erosion of google culture or mistake in finding the right hire.",1176398434

12275,comment,6668,6668,0,0,matter77,,,"I see the big divide between those who do and those who don't differently. Most people choose a life pursuing happiness, a few choose lives of meaning. The person who chooses a life of meaning wants to get rich, but they secretly don't do it for the money. they simply can't not do their dreams. To most, it's foolishness. It's not that the person choosing a life of meaning doesn't want to be happy, or can't be, it's just that their happiness is largely irrelevant. \nI also disagree with the crap about age. PG filters everything through this fine mesh, then claims the result is representative of the whole. I realized sometime around age 40 that to those who see startups as foolishness, there IS NO GOOD AGE. I kept wondering how I could go instantly from being too young to being too old. According to most, there is no good age. It's always a bad idea.\nWhat PG is experiencing is this. Much of the corporate World, and the homes of families in which people grow up, it is heavily permission-based. In the Midwest for example, anyone behind a tech startup is considered out of line because they didn't ask permission, they didn't spend twenty years climbing a permission ladder. If they succeed, they are thought to have broken the rules. Younger people are more rebellious - we don't need no stinking permission - and can succeed if they don't first spend years working for a bunch of mindless droids. \nYet, it is still far superior to have broken through all this and risen above it all, to have endured the worst and still plow ahead in relentless pursuit of meaningful dreams to build something great. Meanwhile, there's PG with his clipboard going up and down a check list. I plain know better.",1176397780

And the reason most of the loans go to women is that Yunus has a really bizarre feminist agenda.  Microcredit is maybe a good way to run a charity, but it's not a business.<p><a href=""http://www.mises.org/journals/fm/Dec06.pdf"">http://www.mises.org/journals/fm/Dec06.pdf</a>",1176397483

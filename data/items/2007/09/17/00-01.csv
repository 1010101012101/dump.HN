55459,comment,55381,55381,0,0,myelin,,,"Phil Pearson here from Broadband Mechanics.  We use Xen for all our hosting... the killer feature for us is the performance isolation.  If one site gets too busy for its VM, it might go down, but it doesn't hurt the other sites on the same physical server nearly as much as without virtualization.<p>The ability to (relatively) quickly deploy a blank VM for development is great, too.  It means you can give people more control over things.  If you have lots of dev sites used for demos, there's the danger that someone might make a mistake editing httpd.conf and bring it all down, but if they're all in separate VMs, you don't need to worry.",1189990373

The new rewritten version was sufficiently different that you had to choose to ""upgrade,"" and I never have.  <p>I keep worrying that one day they'll shut it down because I'm the last user, and I'll have to write another web-based site builder.

If it's a few guys and a prototype, $200k of seed money for 50% isn't necessarily a lousy deal.<p>And, for the record, it could last quite a while.  3-5 young guys making rice-and-beans money, cheap rent, 2-3 servers at ServerBeach...<p>The ""professor"" was insulting and controlling-- he raised the VCs' hackles, which isn't going to move the meeting in the right direction.  If he had a problem with the valuation, he should have raised the concern before they'd issued the check.  That's bad faith negotiating.",1189988371

If what you need to do is in the confines of what's been provided by open source, CMS, and the knowledge of other people, sure.  But if one of those three falters, then well, that's where it get a bit tougher.<p>And part of what separates hackers from the non-hackers, is who's willing to learn, dig deeper, and figure out how to do.",1189988034
55447,comment,54631,55310,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Oh, he seemed like a great guy. He just seemed to be overzealous to accomplish a goal that really didn't seem (to me) to matter that much. When he said something along the lines of ""Marion Tinsley is human, and humans make mistakes. Chinook will play perfectly after checkers is solved. Therefore, Chinook is better than Tinsley,"" I could almost hear ""mad scientist"" laughter.<p>To me, a program that already knows the right answer and simply looks it up in a database is much less interesting than a human who arrives at a similar answer through reasoning and intuition, or even an AI program that uses heuristics and some kind of internal scoring mechanism.<p>That's not even mentioning that I think a multi-year computation on something like solving checkers is really a (nearly) useless endeavor. Whose lives will be made better by this? Only in academia could such resources be directed at something with no tangible end value. I guess it's an accomplishment for Schaeffer, but to me it seems like anyone could throw a bunch of CPUs at a program that iterates over all possible checkers positions. I just can't imagine getting much satisfaction for such an accomplishment.",1189987984

55441,comment,55196,55431,0,0,edw519,,,"Just a comment in general.<p>I'm a former Redditer who no longer feels anything in common with the commenters there.  I have found a much better home here.  I love the idea of talented hackers of various ages, backgrounds, and cultures being in ""moving toward"" mode.  If you're interested in a start-up of any kind, you better be in ""moving toward"" mode or just hang it up.<p>I don't know you, or anything about you, and certainly don't want to enter a debate.<p>I didn't name the course ""World Cultures"".  In fact, I'm not even sure that was the name.  Maybe it was ""Social Studies 11"" or something like that.  I remember the teacher and his class as one of my all time favorites.  Imagine my pleasant surprise this morning when I found out that Paul Graham went to the same high school as me and that also, he had one of the same favorite teachers as me.  I've been feeling great all day because of this.  (Yes, I know, after 3 days in front of a terminal, even the little things amuse.  I will try to get a life.)<p>It's often a good idea to be a little skeptical in business.  The times I wasn't, often someone took advantage of me.  Why are you skeptical now?  Don't you believe me?  Do you think there was something fishy about Dr. Shultz's class?  Or are you trying to make some other statement that I'm missing?<p>""I am not sure what I am not supposed to be skeptical about.""<p>I am not sure how to respond to such a strange statement (double negative aside), so I'll just respond with some advice my grandmother gave me long ago, ""If you look for trouble hard enough, you'll find it.""<p>There's a time to be skeptical and a time to be moving forward positively.  Let's do the latter here.  Peace.\n",1189987224

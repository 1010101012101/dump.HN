People with previous programming experience have more trouble than true beginners at that point in the course.<p>The course later moves into 3 other languages (OCaml, Scala, and Java) to try and get the beginners not focused on any particular language, though there is some debate on whether that effectively teaches the beginners any language particularly well.<p>Pyret would definitely be a candidate for replacing OCaml in that sequence as anything with better error messages would be very welcome.",1384018888

No need to train everyone in CFE syntax just to allow an app developer to express that user c on box d is allowed more open file handles.<p>The point though is that It&#x27;d be good to have as a first class language feature instead of each cfe site reinventing a separate framework for the same functionality.<p>Haven&#x27;t had any hands on with 3.5 so not familiar with that, but better print debugging isnt where I was going with the idea. I want to be able to step through a bundle, I want to be able to break when global class X is set. I want to then be able to set class X while stepping through. Kinda like making debug logging level interative and with higher signal to noise ratio on screen.<p>If there was language support for unit testing my bundles I could use that to reason about what I expect to happen. Diego Zambonis book proposed one way to do that with the existing facilities but its just a proof of concept, e.g. it cant guarantee environment cleanup after a show stopping error in a test.",1384018854

From Wikipedia:<p>>In commodity money, intrinsic value can be partially or entirely due to the desirable features of the object as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Examples of such features include divisibility; easily and securely storable and transportable; scarcity; and difficulty to counterfeit.<p>I see Bitcoin as three things: a commodity, a &#x27;trust-less&#x27; payment network and a distributed ledger. Now, those are all value-worthy features in my book, especially the latter two.<p>If you live in a bankless country without a stable currency, Bitcoin is a very powerful tool that has &#x27;intrinsic&#x27; value in its capacity to serve your financial needs where other instruments have failed or are entirely absent. Same goes for folk stuck in countries with severe capital controls or vicious austerity measures.<p>If gold has &quot;intrinsic value&quot;, so does Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin has more value from that perspective; since when you could you divide gold infinitely? It&#x27;s also counterfeitable; Bitcoin, not so much.  That&#x27;s what all these clowns like Joe Weisenthal don&#x27;t seem to understand because they are so caught up in their own ideas of sound money that they can&#x27;t see the value that Bitcoin brings to the table.

What&#x27;s the biggest change your group has gone through in the last year? Does your group feel like the recession is over and things are getting better, or are things still pretty bleak?<p>2.	If I get the job, how do I earn a &quot;gold star&quot; on my performance review? What are the key accomplishments you&#x27;d like to see in this role over the next year?<p>3.	What&#x27;s your (or my future boss&#x27;) leadership style?<p>4.	About which competitor are you most worried?<p>5.	How does sales / operations / technology / marketing / finance work around here? (I.e., groups other than the one you&#x27;re looking to work in.)<p>6.	What type of people are successful here? What type of people are not?<p>7.	What&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s key to this company&#x27;s success that somebody from outside the company wouldn&#x27;t know about?<p>8.	How did you get your start in this industry? Why do you stay?<p>9.	What are your group&#x27;s best and worst working relationships with other groups in the company?<p>10.	What keeps you up at night? What&#x27;s your biggest worry these days?<p>11.	What&#x27;s the timeline for making a decision on this position? When should I get back in touch with you?<p>12.	These are tough economic times, and every position is precious when it comes to the budget. Why did you decide to hire somebody for this position instead of the many other roles / jobs you could have hired for? What about this position made your prioritize it over others?<p>13.	What is your reward system? Is it a star system / team-oriented / equity-based / bonus-based / &quot;attaboy!&quot;-based? Why is that your reward system? What do you guys hope to get out of it, and what actually happens when you put it into practice? What are the positives and the negatives of your reward system? If you could change any one thing, what would it be?<p>14.	What information is shared with the employees (revenues, costs, operating metrics)? Is this an open-book shop, or do you play it closer to the vest? How is information shared? How do I get access to the information I need to be successful in this job?<p>15.	If we have a very successful 2015, what would that look like? What will have have happened over the next 12 months? How does this position help achieve that?<p>16.	How does the company / my future boss do performance reviews? How do I make the most of the performance review process to ensure that I&#x27;m doing the best I can for the company?<p>17.	What is the rhythm to the work around here? Is there a time of year that it&#x27;s all hands on deck and we&#x27;re pulling all-nighters, or is it pretty consistent throughout the year? How about during the week / month? Is it pretty evenly spread throughout the week / month, or are there crunch days?<p>18.	What type of industry / functional / skills-based experience and background are you looking for in the person who will fill this position? What would the &quot;perfect&quot; candidate look like? How do you assess my experience in comparison? What gaps do you see?<p>19.	In my career, I&#x27;ve primarily enjoyed working with big / small / growing / independent / private / public / family-run companies. If that&#x27;s the case, how successful will I be at your firm?<p>20.	Who are the heroes at your company? What characteristics do the people who are most celebrated have in common with each other? Conversely, what are the characteristics that are common to the promising people you hired, but who then flamed out and failed or left? As I&#x27;m considering whether or not I&#x27;d be successful here, how should I think about the experiences of the heroes and of the flame-outs?",1384018225

Be careful of HR starting your conversation with &quot;Your total compensation is $80,000 per year&quot; when they then mumble &quot;That&#x27;s a $45,000 base and a $35,000 bonus, paid out yearly at the end of your hire date anniversary.&quot;  Your huge total comp package may make your ego feel good, but you can&#x27;t budget against end of year bonuses.<p>- Stock is always imaginary unless you&#x27;re at a public company.  Always try to double or triple the base &quot;options&quot; they offer.  Be wary of places that do 25% cliffs instead of 50% cliffs.  25% cliffs are just silly.",1384017868

Someone you meet at a party and have a good time with for the duration of that party is immediately part of your near intimate social network, at least now. You might even share personal things with that person. The next day you might find it weird if they called you however if you didn&#x27;t leave the night explicitly on some kind of terms to hang out more.<p>Over time we grow closer to some people and further away from others.<p>Facebook isn&#x27;t engineered to do handle this. It just wants more and more data, more connections. It doesn&#x27;t reflect real life. Build a social network where friending and un-friending is determined algorithmically, based on the number interactions and type and their content instead of a button you have to toggle and it may be take off. Problem is, you&#x27;d have to own all the channels through which people communicate.<p>Turns out people don&#x27;t want to have to maintain a social graph.",1384016792

It&#x27;s because of Windows and its ecosystem filled with all the scum this industry has to offer.<p>People pay for valuable software. If people don&#x27;t want to pay for your software, then it may mean that your software isn&#x27;t worth paying for. And I can agree with ads loaded inside that software. In my eyes ads are a legitimate way of monetizing software.<p>But pushing extra adware junk down on users&#x27; throats, especially plugins for other pieces of software, like browsers? That&#x27;s taking it a step way too far. And this also hurts developers that are monetizing their apps by serving tasteful ads. Not to mention that it hurts the browser makers - for example my wife wants Chrome, not Firefox, because she doesn&#x27;t have the expertise to keep her Firefox clean and because Firefox is more open, more extensible, I&#x27;ve never seen a Firefox instance on Windows that&#x27;s not overloaded with third-party junk.<p>But hey, lets poison the pool for everybody, right? Thanks guys for killing an otherwise viable business model, not to mention the only major browser built by a non-profit.",1384016708

Instead, they take responsibility for educating their manager, in a way that the manager can understand and without threatening their ego.  So if the manager says &quot;Just do it like this&quot;, your response should be &quot;That won&#x27;t work because X, Y, and Z.  However, I could do it like this, and it will have these costs and benefits and take me this long, and that&#x27;s why I believe this is a superior course of action.&quot;  At all points the decision is still up to the manager, but the senior engineer has brought enough data and experience to bear that they can convince their manager that it was a good idea to begin with.",1384016464

(I am flexible, but I would like to know what role I am being hired for, as job descriptions are often opaque or misleading)<p>Unspoken questions I&#x27;m looking to have answered by coming in for an interview as a job candidate:<p>- What is the dynamic between employees?<p>- What is the company culture?<p>- How intense is work at the place typically? (just for personal gauging purposes - this isn&#x27;t a make or break thing, but it&#x27;s something I want to know)<p>- Does the workplace treat its employees well? (do the employees look happy to be there?)<p>- How transparent is a company when answering my questions?  Are the responses detailed?  Is there something that is being hidden from me?<p>There are probably more questions I tend to want answered that are never spoken, but incumbent on me to take note of through observations.

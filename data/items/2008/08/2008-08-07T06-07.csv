My current Dell has been solid, but it's a few years old now, so things could have gotten worse since then.  It <i>does</i> have a crappy audio signal flaw (the power is fed into the ADC unfiltered so it has an atrocious buzz when recording), which apparently existed through multiple revisions of the board, without a fix from Dell, despite awareness of the problem and dozens of posts in the Dell forums about it (I guess a redesign was more expensive than sending a USB audio adapter to the few people who complained).<p>Anyway, I'm tempted by the XPS M1330, which has gotten excellent reviews, and lots of recommendations from HN readers and on reddit.  I am about due for a new lappy...the Asus and Thinkpads also look good, but Dell being a bit greener certainly isn't a bad thing.",1218091572

269414,comment,269243,269243,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Before BitTorrent became a company, and I was operating my first startup (which was a web caching and website acceleration appliance vendor), I thought that an amazing business could be built on making BitTorrent a competitive advantage for ISPs rather than merely a huge bandwidth cost.  The problem with BitTorrent is that it's wonderful for consumers, and horrible for ISPs.  Help solve the ISPs problems while providing better consumer service, and you've got something that ISPs would pay huge for.<p>Technically I'm not exactly sure how it would be solved...you'd have to look to Akamai for starters, since they've solved the data locality problem in interesting ways.  Basically, you'd probably have an aggressive local caching BT tracker and a friendly deal with all of your peering partners to provide lower cost lower priority BT traffic during slow hours.  I tinkered with a BT cache for a little while, but gave it up when BitTorrent the company came into existence as I assumed they'd be on that problem in no time, and with the BitTorrent name would be the champs of the block in no time.  Turns out, they have no idea how to make BT make money.<p>Of course, I could be wrong.  Millions of consumers vs. a few thousand ISPs makes for a hard decision to make, and a startup usually can't address both markets successfully.  And, of course, the only way a BT cache could work is if it were active, like usenet, and was pulling new stuff all the time rather than just on request like a web cache.  Which brings up more interesting copyright issues.",1218089802

I.e. payment on Angel funding, till then 1% interest after first 6 months.<p>What are the pitfall of such a deal? If I go for it, how should I structure the deal?",1218089710

RescueTime did a fantastic job at removing the ""time poor"" component for keeping track of where you spend your time, hence living up to its name.<p>Having worked in the corporate world and in start-ups I can tell you now that most corporate clients already have a time sheet system that is a pain in the a<i></i>. Employees spend at least 30mins or so a day writing everything they did throughout the day and billing their time where appropriate.<p>When it comes to getting management feedback for each task you did, again managers are time poor having to deal with more then 1 person in their team + their own tasks from higher management. Hence why performance reviews between you and manager occur every quarter / 6 months / annually and only focus on the high level picture - the stuff that counts - the outcomes / results.<p>Micromanagement is another issue; no one likes to jot down every action they did. What ""matters"" is always the end result not the bits in the middle. I.e. taking a client for coffee spending 2 hours out of the office is a step to a potential sale (building rapport). At the end of the day, the sale is what will count on your performance agreement not the coffee break. My manager doesn't want to know that I went to coffee with a client unless I managed to get a sale.<p>I'm sure some of you would have heard this before but the best workers are those where management give them what they need to do their job and let them do it without micromanaging their time. How and when they do it doesn't matter, all that matters is the end results (outcomes).",1218089266

Having a ""software design phase"" just wouldn't make sense for us since it basically covers the whole cycle from when the idea comes out to when it hits the streets.<p>* We generally pair on development where at all possible, and when we are pairing we don't find that we get a great deal of additional value out of code reviews on top.<p>* When we don't pair for whatever reason we do code reviews, but do them on a regular cadence rather than as a phase (say every Wednesday afternoon). A bunch of stuff fits in this kind of pattern. We are sure to talk to users every couple of weeks. We do some usability testing every couple of weeks. It's not related to how stories flow so it's not on the board.",1334689171

The only thing I managed to find, besides references to the intra-collection locking ticket (https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-1241, btw is ""intra-collection"" the same as ""document?"") was some obscure forum post about b-tree indexes not allowing concurrent writes.<p>Obviously, not having a global write-lock would increase write (and consequently read) performance by orders of magnitude, especially for in-memory data sets.<p>Does anybody have insight as to what the technical limitations are here?

3854344,comment,3852190,3852190,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"We need to divorce ourselves from the industrial, factory-floor approach to management that has dominated American office culture since the dawn of the 20th cetury. Almost all of our long-held beliefs about management originated in theories developed to manage workers on an assembly line. And many (most?) of them no longer apply. For instance, the rigid belief in ""butts in seats"" and ""face time"" as reasonable proxies for productivity is grounded in the days when there really <i>was</i> a direct, perfect correlation between attendance at a set place and time and job performance.<p>On a primitive factory floor, the worker who puts in the most time making widgets really <i>is</i> producing better results than the worker who appears on and off the floor sporadically. There's no way to produce results unless you're working X machine, and X machine is in a fixed location, and it operates between Y and Z hours of the day. And the end product doesn't differ per worker. Everything's deterministic and can be measured precisely. So, in this scenario, a worker is only as good as he is present and 100% utilized. Nothing else matters.<p>Knowledge work doesn't function that way. And yet, we still have this desire to manage it as though it does. Kudos to someone like Sandberg for being able to point this out. Yeah, she's in a position to say it now. No, most of us aren't. But at least someone in her position is finally calling it out, and using the bully pulpit afforded to her by her high-status role to do so.",1334688829

Lean startup essentially means testing and learning from a basic prototype for everything that you do. New feature? Test it. New level? Test it. Agile development, to the best of my knowledge (I am not a programmer), is focused more on being adaptable and changing course quickly. Lean startup is focused more on using scientific method to determine decisions rather than indiscriminate opinions of the internal team. It includes agile development but is not agile for the sake of being fast.<p>I agree with your point that games HAVE to be finished on release. My counter to the prototype argument would be that you can launch the game as a MVG in an unbranded, low-fi way that wouldn't jeopardize your actual game's launch. Instead, you'd just have a crappy game that people would test, and then you'd kill it and launch the new game without any association to the test game at all.",1334688435

Infrastructure, suppliers, scheduling, production support, release procedures, etc. There is also a bit of organization and dynamic scaling necessary: you don't want a program backlog with 4 thousand items on it. That's unworkable.<p>Usually it helps if you stay with fixed iterations instead of Kanban and do program planning all at once (Yes, 150 people all in the same room working out the next couple of sprints. Fun to watch and participate in!)<p>Other kinds of tooling issues become bigger in a large group, like how to integrate separate physical pieces, how many branches to have in your CM tool, how technical drawings will be cataloged, etc. But none of it is super hard, and lots of other folks have already gone down this road. The important thing is not to over-constrain your development environment just to make yourself feel safer.<p>The biggest obstacle to running a larger group like this is dealing with the parts that are counter-intuitive. It just seems natural with 100 folks that you'd have a detailed charge-code breakdown, for instance. Or that 100% capacity is something you want to achieve. There are a few more gotchas like this, but if people are open-minded, it can mean a huge increase both in performance and happiness.<p>The industry is moving towards plain kanban without the sprints. I like this idea with smaller groups, especially groups with lots of support work on existing code, but for larger projects creating something new, using sprints, having a fixed point of coordination for a lot of different stuff, works much better.<p>Note I didn't say you couldn't go total kanban at large scale, just that there was a trade-off involved with each path.",1334688266

Conversely, a sentence or two in Japanese can potentially be translated into a longer block of English due to English requiring a certain syntax: I believe English is SVO/OSV (Subject-Verb-Object: I'll go there) whereas Japanese is SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).<p>The reason I bring up the SVO/SOV/etc. types is that it's a pretty significant difference when comparing languages. Spanish, I believe, is similar to English in that they're both SVO: My name is ____, Mi nombre es ____ -- Similar syntax. On the other side of the spectrum, the Chinese language structure (again, not completely sure) allows for almost any arrangement of words and will yield different meanings depending on where words are positioned.

That's one of the weakness of a democratic election. If you transpose that to Kickstarter people have to ""editorialize"" their propositions and product features because they need to be seen. A funding pledge is like a vote and will very likely create the same dynamic as in an democratic elective system.<p>I don't buy the Kickstarter Kool Aid from a consumer point of view, because I think there is a lot of deceptions ahead and it has a ""mob-like"" mentality that typically develops around websites like Reddit or Hacker News (and you can see here just how strong kickstarter resonates in minds with a post every other day). From a developer point of view that's way better because you can fund your projects on (almost) thin air, however I can foresee that honest developers that will try to follow their claims will have a hard time completing their projects.<p>The benefit of funding via VC or other non-democratic mean is you have HARD deadlines, business plans, your money is on the table, it's not just an idea thrown in the air which you hope the wind will catch. I strongly believe that product innovation and creation will remain an aristocratic process.<p>I would be delighted if somebody can prove me wrong!",1334687556

I've seen tax returns for many of inDinero's customers, and it's clear to me that their previous accountants took shortcuts in compiling the return.<p>Yes, it'll get filed.  But there were probably more tax advantageous things they could have / should have done.  Consider these examples:<p>1 - tax credits. How is the government supposed to automatically know that you're paying for child care? How are they to know that you just installed solar panels on your roof or that you just purchased an electric vehicle?  Sure, they can make this ""automatic"" -- but then you'd still be going out of your way to report your purchase, and this is in no way simpler than the current solution today.<p>2 - does it make sense to be taxed as a partnership or sole-proprietor?  For a lot of our customers, they're basically flushing $20k down the toilet because they didn't want to go through the tiny nuisance of filing as an S-Corporation.  Pretty sure you don't want the IRS to dictate your tax treatment.<p>3 - should you depreciate your Aeron chairs over multiple years, or do accelerated depreciation which will allow you to deduct the entire amount in a single year?  The IRS gives us the flexibility to choose, and it's questions like these that may require the help of a tax professional.<p>4 - deducting vehicle expenses.  How is the IRS supposed to figure out how many miles on your car were used for business VS personal purposes?<p>5 - what part of your apartment was used exclusively for hacking?  No way for the IRS to know that the number is  250/1500 square feet.<p>In short, putting together a tax return isn't that hard.  The difficult part is hunting down all of this other information that we have no way of just knowing.<p>Instead of asking why robots couldn't be doing our taxes by now, we might rephrase the question to read ""how can we do year-round accounting in such a way that taxes are 10X easier to take care of?""",1334687444

You couldn't write an AGILE operating system, for example (or rather, shouldn't). Similarly, writing an AGILE game is equivalent to setting sail for fail.<p>Consider this: a potential customer can purchase an older AAA title on steam for 5-10 bucks. They can purchase a brand new AA title for about 15 bucks. They can purchase an extremely polished indie title for 5-10 bucks. As a developer, what's your bottom line here?<p>Games HAVE to be finished, debugged, and polished on day 1 of release. AGILE development works for incremental software development, not for games. I don't think you realize how many one-man development teams out there release extremely polished and innovative indie titles and STILL don't make it on Steam (or other marketing platforms). There is absolutely no way a half-assed AGILE-released game will make it on the Apple Store, let alone Steam.<p>Furthermore, gamers in general are a cynical bunch. Release a bad/unfinished game, and you're done. To reiterate, I completely agree with the prototyping idea - i.e. hey this seems like a fun mechanic lets make a quick prototype - but not releasing the prototype to the public (unless we're talking open source projects here).",1334687192

If you were to translate English sentences into literally equivalent Japanese phrases, you would invariably create phrases with far more syllables. However the language is not used the same way as English. A child will say in English ""Mom was angry with me."" In Japanese he says ""okocchatta."" Same information conveyed but requiring context for the Japanese (doesn't explicitly say ""mom).<p>Furthermore, I would argue that when you compare equivalent sentences in English and Japanese, the Japanese sentence often conveys MORE information. Take the English sentence ""You did not eat."" 4 syllables. There are many ways to say this in Japanese.<p>A formal translation would be ""Anata wa tabemasen deshita."" Somewhere between 9 and 12 syllables depending on pronunciation.  This sentence conveys a lot of information that the English does not. For example, the use of ""anata"" instead of a more rough word for ""you"" suggests that the speaker has a certain type of relationship with the subject. The same is true of ""tabemasen deshita"", which could have been ""kutta"" meaning ""did not eat"", but much less polite.<p>In myriad ways the Japanese language allows for speakers to be explicit about their relationships with others and their sense of place. English by contrast requires listeners to be more attentive to tone of voice, body language, and word connotations.",1334687117

3854095,comment,3852341,3853743,5,0,sseveran,,,"At the point of IPO the capital for a company has already typically been allocated. The financial markets allow the owners of a company to sell their shares to the public and realize profits on their prior investments. After that markets are about betting whether the price of the company will go up or down and people trade accordingly.<p>The need to trade instantly is very important for risk mitigation. If unexpected news comes out today that a company is the target of an adverse event like a DOJ lawsuit many market participants will want to react as fast as possible to the news. Say it takes 30 seconds for the price to fall by $10. If you could trade at the 15 second mark you would only lose $5. To an investment firm (non Market Maker or other HFT) this can be crucially important and many firms have automated systems of their own to trade.<p>A key point of the article that most people miss is that someone has always fulfilled the role that HFTs currently occupy. In the old days floor traders occupied this role as pointed out by the article. Floor trading was a club where you had to buy a seat to be allowed in. Depending on the market the cost of the seat might be hundreds of thousands of dollars. The traders controlled access to the markets and for some markets like Oil the only way to trade was through these floor traders. Now these floor traders took full advantage of this and kept the spreads on the instruments they traded much wider than they are today. In the early 90s you could easily pay $.20 per share to the market maker to get a fill on a liquid stock.<p>The realization (as pointed out by the article) that computers could do this better and faster is just like any other industry. The people most hurt by this development were the floor traders themselves. There is a movie called The Pit that explores the effect that computerized trading had on floor traders in Chicago. Today if I want to trade MSFT the spread on BATS's BZX exchange was just $0.01. To me, another market participant I consider it to be much better to pay a penny to Getco rather than $.20 to a floor trader.<p>The colocation business as it has evolved has made market access more equal, not less. Today anyone can pay to colocate a server at NASDAQ, NYSE, BATS, etc... I know longer have to buy a floor seat to be able to trade there. Now there are real market barriers to entry but they are not structural. Just as you can't go build a Google competitor given that you don't have all the historical search traffic data and the infrastructure to compete with them, HFT firms have made significant investments in infrastructure of their own. If you had sufficient capital for technology development you could compete with any other HFT firm.<p>Yes there are people hurt by HFT, just like anything else when new players with greater efficiency emerge. However the average investor who is not competing with these firms is not harmed. The floor traders were, just like telephone operators before them.",1334686122

The complex routing rules can then be set in software which allows for much easier and more capable traffic routing.\nIt also allows more innovation in this part of the infrastructure which has traditionally been very resistant to it because of the incumbent players.

However if you were to grab a random woman off the street, she is likely to have greater aptitude than a random man you grab off the street.<p>So in US highschools where grading is bounded and the same testing is forced on everyone, we see women routinely trouncing their male counter parts in GPA scores.<p>Then in college, where people have a choice more men go into difficult but unprofitable majors (e.g. Physics), additionally women have a bias against certain subjects (e.g. Computer Science) due to the low-status accorded to it, and thus choose other majors like Law or Medicine.<p>----<p>Bringing it back to Genetics, that means the 'dum dum gene' (gene which causes aptitude variance) is on the Y chromosome, thus women aren't affected by it at all.",1334685600

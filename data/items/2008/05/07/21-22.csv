183912,comment,183846,183846,0,0,lux,,,"Socializing is both something human beings feel a need to do (therefore useful in itself to satisfy that need) but it can also augment other activities to make them more useful too.  The latter requires care not to do ""social for the sake of being social in context Y"" type stuff though.  It has to make sense to facilitate the original goal of the app.<p>Twitter seems to take some people a lot longer than others to ""get"" (myself included).  But I think that's because we're thinking of it in terms of the latter scenario, i.e. what is its use besides socializing?  But socializing is a use in itself too, which we tend to forget (us stereotypically anti-social hacker types... ;).<p>As an aside, the stereotype of the hacker as anti-social is quite a contradiction to the idea of a hacker founder, since the founder is a leader, front of the crowd.  Us hackers these days seem to be turning that one on its head :)",1210197095

Help raise relief funds for distribution.<p>In the wake of a massive cyclone, at least 22,000 Burmese are dead. More than 40,000 are missing. A million are homeless.<p>But what's happening in Burma is not just a natural disaster - it's also a catastrophe of bad leadership.<p>Burma's brutal and corrupt military junta failed to warn the people, failed to evacuate any areas, and suppressed freedom of communication so that Burmese people didn't know the storm was coming when the rest of the world did. Now the government is failing to respond to the disaster and obstructing international aid organizations.<p>Humanitarian relief is urgently needed, but Burma's government could easily delay, divert or misuse any aid. Today the International Burmese Monks Organization, including many leaders of the democracy protests last fall, launched a new effort to provide relief through Burma's powerful grass roots network of monasteries--the most trusted institutions in the country and currently the only source of housing and support in many devastated communities. Click below to help the Burmese people with a donation and see a video appeal to Avaaz from a leader of the monks:<p>https://secure.avaaz.org/en/burma_cyclone/7.php?cl=86630795<p>Giving to the monks is a smart, fast way to get aid directly to Burma's people. Governments and international aid organizations are important, but face challenges--they may not be allowed into Burma, or they may be forced to provide aid according to the junta's rules. And most will have to spend large amounts of money just setting up operations in the country. The monks are already on the front lines of the aid effort--housing, feeding, and supporting the victims of the cyclone since the day it struck. The International Burmese Monks Organization will send money directly to each monastery through their own networks, bypassing regime controls.<p>Last year, more than 800,000 of us around the world stood with the Burmese people as they rose up against the military dictatorship. The government lost no time then in dispatching its armies to ruthlessly crush the nonviolent democracy movement--but now, as tens of thousands die, the junta's response is slow and threatens to divert precious aid into the corrupt regime's pockets.<p>The monks are unlikely to receive aid from governments or large humanitarian organizations, but they have a stronger presence and trust among the Burmese people than both. If we all chip in a little bit, we can help them to make a big difference.<p>Click here to donate:<p>https://secure.avaaz.org/en/burma_cyclone/7.php?cl=86630795",1210194942

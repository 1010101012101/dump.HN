8351640,comment,8349655,8350736,2,0,aric,,,"I said it partly distills a spirit of <i>cities that never sleep</i>, not of <i>sleep</i>. :) Not everyone lives in dense urban areas. And many who do don&#x27;t want to listen to the actual noise of their environment. It&#x27;s often distracting. That&#x27;s the point of setting a mood. It&#x27;s escapism. You try to choose how you want to feel. Beyond altering the immediate space around oneself via sound, lighting, scents, physical comfort, scenery, and ambiance in general, one may want to remain tuned into the larger, active world through real-time streams yet not have it be distracting. That could come through web sites, visuals, music, television, radio, shortwave, or any other medium that creates a sense of &#x27;living information.&#x27; It <i>can</i> be comforting. It can be greatly <i>humanizing</i>.<p>One may be deep in the heart of a sardine-packed city, feeling disconnected. No setting is exclusive to the shaping of one&#x27;s feelings except to those who may not care to shape their own positive perception.<p>> <i>It then completely removes actual humanity and suffering, and replaces it with dispassionate narration of management of human activity.</i><p>It depends on the person being affected. Speaking only for myself, it&#x27;s the opposite of dispassion. Sure, I love dark, dystopic, cyberpunk moods with the best of &#x27;em. Personally, however, and I&#x27;m sure this rings true for others here, I&#x27;m always left with overwhelming sense of hopefulness in those moments of unease. It&#x27;s a feeling that humanity can come together to resist and overcome obstacles. It&#x27;s entirely empathetic and passionate. On the topic of police scanners, indeed, upsetting moments occur. Suffering occurs. Humorous moments occur too. It&#x27;s interesting. My constant worry and sincere hope goes out to people in need even at the mere sound of an ambulance. The presence of critical information is not fuel of sadism. It&#x27;s fuel of concern, curiosity, connectedness, and awareness.<p>News functions greatly in this respect. Heavy news affects those who are willing to bear witness to it. It&#x27;s humanity&#x27;s suffering. News of the world&#x27;s plight causes a rollercoaster of emotions. As much as it brings pain, shock, tears, pessimism, and cynicism, it so too brings cause, unity, hope, struggle, and awareness. The electricity of urgency has its own presence <i>regardless</i> of how different people objectify it. People who tune-out of it altogether <i>could</i> be equally objectifying, depending on their attitude and perception. Tuning out can be healthy just the same. Emotions are &#x27;pluralistic&#x27; amid extremes of peace, fear, love, happiness, and curiosity. Lightning, though terrifying, remains electrifying.<p>> <i>That said, I have code to do... so on with the suffering!</i><p>Hilarious! I&#x27;m entering a more upbeat mood now. A mix of violent gangsta rap blended with the life-affirming moans of highway traffic will suffice. A.B.C.",1411408769

8351635,comment,8347380,8350863,1,0,freehunter,,,"As a layman who has read up a bit on how the brain processes stimuli such as visual data (my mom has severe migraines and I&#x27;m afraid someday I will be told this information by a doctor on her behalf), what I understand is that if the part of the brain that would normally process these images is damaged, the brain has to be rewired to use another part for this activity. So it&#x27;s &quot;painful&quot; because that part of the brain isn&#x27;t used to processing this data, so it&#x27;s inefficient at it. Looking at a static image is easy, looking at something with a complex physics system such as a lot of individually moving leaves would require more processing power. The more sprites/polygons on screen, the harder it is to render, to use computing examples.<p>I might be wrong, and I would love to be educated further if my understanding is incorrect.

We use Rails as our frontend for Microcorruption.com, and Golang to do the heavy lifting of emulating thousands of microcontrollers.<p>Sticking with something convention for your front-end solves a couple problems:<p>* Golang&#x27;s front-end capabilities aren&#x27;t as mature as Ruby&#x27;s and Python&#x27;s. You can find yourself fighting the libraries a bit. In particular: you&#x27;ll end up writing a lot of boilerplate database code.<p>* There is a much broader base of talent for building Rails and Python than there is for Golang. And: most teams have people that specialize on front-end and (a usually smaller) group of people that do the hard-core backend stuff.<p>* Backend components are usually architecturally hidden, which should give you some peace of mind about ever needing to replace those Golang components --- you might never need to do it if you draw the right boxes and arrows, and if you do, at least you&#x27;ll be replacing a well-defined component.",1411408528

Then some set of pages will have memory for A, and some set will have memory for B. If you&#x27;re not using A, then the operating system will notice that those pages have not been used in a while and if under memory pressure it will page them out. This won&#x27;t affect pages with memory for B.<p>The only issue would be if most of the memory allocations are under your system&#x27;s page size (typically 4096 bytes) and distributed randomly, so that a lot of pages have data structures associated with multiple different tabs. But I think that&#x27;s unlikely, and even if it is true, couldn&#x27;t it be resolved by making your allocation strategy tab-aware (e.g., by giving each tab its own malloc arena, which would be way simpler than splitting the browser into multiple processes).<p>Am I missing something here?",1411408326

We monitor traffic across all devices, browsers, OS&#x27;s, and locations to find any anomalies and alert you about them.<p>The reason we built it is because we all worked together for a conversion optimization company during the past years and a lot of our big clients had no way to actively monitor segments and it was way too time consuming to constantly check over Google Analytics. So we took all our brain power and created something that did it autonomously!<p>In addition to the automated alerting, there is the ability to set up custom alerts so you can track specific goals (i.e. alert me when I reach X conversion over X time, or when X referral ID reaches X visitors, etc.)<p>Oh yeah, and we do server + SSL cert monitoring too.<p>We think it&#x27;s really cool and has been extremely helpful over the years that we&#x27;ve been building it out and modifying it.<p>http://www.voodooalerts.com/<p>If you guys have any questions, ask away!",1411406818

If they are all cpu bound doing stuff, then your machine is again in trouble, current process or not.  If they are all constantly thrashing in resources, you are still in trouble.<p>Why would you think the current monolithic would page out a tab that was actively being used?  Why would this not also happen in the &quot;per process&quot; approach?<p>That is, how would this specifically help?  If you are actively using the memory for the current tab, because it is the current tab, why would it be swapped out under the monolithic case where it would not in the per process case?<p>I&#x27;m perfectly willing to accept there is a scenario I am not considering.

You need to be able to trust the code that runs on your system, and to do that you want to ensure only admin can install things.<p>Of course, Windows has now partially solved that with UAC. Unfortunately you can never know if you can trust the software or not though. However this does stop malware from secretly running without your permission, since it would require a UAC prompt to run.

6568919,comment,6567039,6567039,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"I agree that multiple approaches towards learning will facilitate entrepreneurship and innovation, but I think this article missed something important; the Self-Learner. College Education and Supplemental Education have something very basic in common; the information is provided to you. Conceptually speaking, this implies that there is a limitation to the amount that you learn. Because the person learning is reliant on being provided with information to learn, they will only learn what is provided. Conceptually speaking, this seems like a somewhat controlled (in-the-box) approach towards learning, and does not really remind me of entrepreneurship and innovation. In real world practice, this does not hold true because people are always looking for more to learn. People are not limited, especially in todays Information Age. Being able to find new information to learn with no limitations is an extremely powerful concept. And I think this is what was missing from the article. I call it the Self-Learner, but I&#x27;m sure there are many different names for it; The Tinkerer, the Enthusiast, the Hacker, etc. This is someone that finds so much enjoyment in learning about a specific topic or craft that they pursue it as their Passion. Depending on their level of enjoyment and/or drive to learn, I believe that the Self-Learner approach provides an unlimited potential with regards to learning. So where College Education and Supplemental Education might eventually run out of material to provide to you, the Self-Learner never runs out of material because they are always driven to learn more. And the longer they pursue their Passion, the more they learn, and the better they become at their craft. I think this is an extremely important aspect of entrepreneurship and innovation. I think you&#x27;ll find that most successful innovators practice self-learning in one form or another throughout their life. They may have been participating in College Education and Supplemental Education, but it was the stuff they learned on their own that really gave them the skills to do something amazing.",1382053499

We know there are plenty of people who would make off with the gold in Fort Knox if they could because hold-ups and bank-robberies happen all the time.<p>We do know the level of risk that the TSA is defending against is minuscule because of these basic facts:<p>(1) The TSA is not catching terrorists: No TSA action has ever resulted in a conviction on terrorism related charges.  To the best of my knowledge, the only actual arrest on terrorism charges turned out to be completely bogus.[1]  Meanwhile they crow about stupid little things like the guy with a funny looking water bottle.[2]<p>(2) The TSA is not deterring terrorists: Someone bent on spreading terror doesn&#x27;t just give up because good security scared them off - they find another target.	 There are all kinds of high-profile soft targets: Shopping malls, the line at the airport, bridges, tunnels, movie theaters, derailing passenger trains, etc.  It does not require much imagination to come up with a very long list of easy targets.<p>But so far we&#x27;ve seen just one effective attack like that - the Boston marathon and it was super easy for those guys to pull off.   It is so easy, yet it is a once-in-a-decade event.

It can be random as in &quot;randomly pick a <i>participant</i>, let it buy/sell as much of the stock as it asked, then pick another participant etc.&quot;. This encourages Sybil attacks - participants have an incentive to create other identities for themselves, and hope one of the identities will be picked &quot;randomly&quot;. Another definition of &quot;random&quot; may be &quot;randomly pick an <i>order</i> to buy/sell a single stock, execute it, repeat-until&quot;. This, I was told on an earlier HN thread, strongly encourages placing more orders than one wants, again in the hope of fooling the &quot;random&quot; part of the exchange. I was told this is actually what&#x27;s happening currently in exchanges built this way.<p>I had a suggestion I tried to analyze (even as a possible idea for a mechanism design paper): What happens if &quot;random&quot; is defined as &quot;your chance of getting picked (to be able to sell the stock) is proportional to the amount of this stock you own&quot;? At least, we got rid of the incentive for Sybil attacks (and didn&#x27;t create the opposite incentive, for conglomerates - separate entities don&#x27;t have an incentive to present themselves as a single entity, then do the bookkeeping internally). But it&#x27;s unclear what to do when there are more willing buyers than sellers. Any thoughts, anyone?<p>I have also wondered whether this whole thing is an artifact of quantization - what would happen if the price granularity was allowed to be as small as one wants?<p>(In case anyone&#x27;s wondering, a friend I consulted told me this probably wouldn&#x27;t fly as a paper - useful economic policy if I can solve that &quot;more buyers&quot; problem, but nothing scientifically novel).<p>p.s.

I&#x27;m happy to watch him do it, and hope for the best.<p>Perhaps &#x27;stupid&#x27; carries too much of a pejorative tone here, how about &#x27;ill advised&#x27; ? or &#x27;very unlikely to pay off&#x27; ? That distinguishes it from &#x27;stupid&#x27; which means &#x27;likely to take out innocent bystanders&#x27; such as say creating a financial instrument out of CDOs. Also stupid but the risk there is wider.",1382051268

Shortcuts on the task bar could not run (with the exception of Chrome oddly enough). If you select run in IE it fails because it saves to temp and some installers failed as well, again because of the use of temp. \nUnless the end user is very saavy or has an onsite IT this seems that the better solution is rotating backups. \nAlternating days to external hard drives that are then disconnected is the best mitigation.   \nAnd having already had one client effected by this is does scare me.

6568758,comment,6567189,6567189,6,0,mindcrime,,,"Cold emailing / cold calling definitely works.  But it&#x27;s a Good Idea to do your homework first.  Here&#x27;s a little tip I learned some time ago, and have been working on implementing lately:<p>Say you want to sell something to Foobar, Incorporated.  But you have no warm contacts there. OK, you can go to Hoovers.com, or use LinkedIn, Jigsaw, etc. and get names, contact info, etc.  BUT... and here&#x27;s the &quot;tip&quot; part... on LinkedIn you can also find people who <i>used to work for Foobar, Inc.</i> and contact them first.  Why?  Because there is a good chance they&#x27;ll offer to talk to you (people like to be helpful and it makes them feel important) and they have little to lose (they don&#x27;t work there anymore), but yet they can still give you TONS of valuable inside information (depending on how long they&#x27;ve been gone) to help you establish credibility when you do call.<p>Example: The info on LinkedIn, Hoovers, etc. can be outdated.  So let&#x27;s say you have a list of 15 names of people at Foobar, Inc.  Some of those people probably aren&#x27;t there anymore, or have changed titles, etc.  When you talk to an ex employee, you can run through the list with them and find out what&#x27;s going on.<p>You also get a chance to ask things like:<p>&quot;Who is the <i>real</i> power broker over there?&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;Are there any big landmines I should know to avoid walking into&quot;?<p>or<p>&quot;What are the main strategic issues management is grappling with there&quot;?<p>etc.<p>Of course, not all ex employees will want to talk to you, but for any reasonably sized company, you should be able to find a few.  And, you do have to be aware that they, in turn, have their biases and misconceptions, etc., and so you can&#x27;t take everything they say as Gospel truth.  But go through the exercise with a couple of people and you should be able to get  pretty clear picture.<p>Now when you call somebody at Foobar, you can start off sounding very credible:<p>&quot;I know companies like yours often deal with issue X, and may have tried solutions like Z that didn&#x27;t work... I&#x27;d like to talk to you about another way of solving that problem...&quot;<p>Where you learned about &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; from those &quot;ex employee talks&quot;.",1382050842

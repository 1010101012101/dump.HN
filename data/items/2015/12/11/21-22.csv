No.<p>There are different ideas for what constitutes AI. Expert systems and knowledge-based reasoners? Pattern-recognizer black boxes? Chatbots? AGI?<p>Over the years the concept of AI shifted. Until recent years &quot;AI&quot; was mostly used for things like A* search, creating algorithms that play turn-based table games for example (see the Russell-Norvig book), symbolic manipulation, ontologies etc., a few years ago it began to also refer to machine learning like neural networks again.<p>Neural networks are good at what they are designed for. Whether they will lead to the path to human-like artificial intelligence is a speculative question. But symbolic manipulation alone won&#x27;t be able to handle the messiness of sensory data for sure. I think neural nets are much better suited for open-ended development than hand engineered pipelines that were state of the art until recently (like extracting corner points, describing them with something like SIFT, clustering the descriptors and using an SVM over bag-of-words histograms). Hand engineering seems too restrictive.",1449871164

Where those will fall woefully short and will still result in the issue I cited are situations like:<p>- Someone who smelled funny, had bad gas, etc.<p>- Baby threw up and the mom wiped it down best she could but the entire car has a whiff of puke<p>- Dirt and grime being tracked in.  Different people have vastly different standards for cleanliness in their vehicles<p>- Water/snow/sludge. Something to be said about going from an indoor garage to your vehicle to an indoor garage at a destination during bad weather.  If the vehicle is picking up other people, etc., there&#x27;s likely to be lots of water/dirt inside.<p>- Food smells and perfumes can set off allergies, sensitive noses, etc.  I sure as heck don&#x27;t want to be in a vehicle where someone was just transporting McDonalds, or where an old lady with way too much perfume was sitting for the past hour<p>- Wrappers, etc. can be left and often times dropped without any sort of onboard camera picking it up<p>- Germs.  Dear god the germs.  How many sick people will be in these things without any way for future passengers to know? If I had a child, I sure wouldn&#x27;t want them in such a vehicle.  I personally would also not want to be in such a vehicle.  Worst case scenario, someone with a serious disease transmitted via blood or bodily fluids (read: HIV+, STDs, etc.) could leave hard to detect amounts on various surfaces. What is the company going to do? Require a blood sample and medical testing from all passengers?<p>So there&#x27;s a whole host of things that are hard to track/place blame on people for without being a technological/legal/political nightmare.  And I totally realize some of these are a bit on the extreme end of the spectrum.  Point is, when owning a vehicle is no longer possible, you won&#x27;t have a choice about being subjected to this.<p>And worth calling out specifically here is the whole surveillance aspect of it.  Forget your vehicle knowing where you are.  Between traffic cams, license plate readers, OnStar, Google Maps/Waze, etc. I think the war on tracking your location has been lost.  What hasn&#x27;t been entirely lost yet is privacy within the vehicle.  I fully expect there to be invasive cameras and sensors watching everything I do in these self-driving cars in the future.<p>Ad-supported ride? Eye-tracking software will monitor whether you are watching the screen when the ad plays.  Temperature/pulse monitors in seats could measure your response to such ads. And that&#x27;s just scratching the surface of the privacy invasion.<p>I&#x27;m trying not to sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat, but I think the past few years have proven that these things aren&#x27;t just possible, they are likely and maybe even inevitable.",1449869703

Finding a new job is relatively easy (depending on your experience and the market) and you can file for an I129 (Change of Status I think) to get a new TN status or change of employer but the main thing to remember is to file this prior to you receiving your last pay check. It will also require for you to show your last two pay stubs with your demand to show that you&#x27;ve actually worked at your first place of employment but it&#x27;s relatively simple. However, going back to the border is much quicker and you get a decision on the spot compared to filing the I129 which takes 15 days and costs ~1500$ (compared to a new status application at the border, 50$).<p>If the new job doesn&#x27;t work out (layoff/fired/quit/etc..) you are supposed to leave on your last day of work. There&#x27;s no &quot;grace period&quot;. If you want to stay you need to apply for a change of status to a B-2 in order to wrap up US affairs which will give you up to 6 months.

I started to automate a lot of the testing after I arrived, but believe you me when I say that it was a tall order.<p>Soon after I moved into development, QA engineers without coding chops were let go, while the others were integrated into the development teams.

Yahoo Finance, The International Business Times, and Forbes are all reporting their numbers. It&#x27;s based on looking at online sales from the top 100 online retailers and extrapolating sales from that data.<p>1010data is not fly by night. They&#x27;ve been around since 2000 and most of their stuff is designed to provide insight to retailers when it comes to what they need to sell. This is an internal industry report, not something generally released to the public. WinBeta got their hands on it, but it&#x27;s not a shocker. The iPad has not been doing well. While the entire tablet segment has been stagnant, the iPad has been hardest hit. The growth segment in the market has been in higher cost productivity designs that can do more.<p>This kind of market data has been around for over a year. It tells you why we&#x27;re seeing all these &quot;me too&quot; Surface products. It&#x27;s not just Surface, it&#x27;s 2-in-1s that are attracting people. Why did Apple make an iPad Pro? Because this is where tablets are going. Few need a consumption only tablet when they can have a device that works for that AND also can get work done.<p>Either IDC or Gartner is showing that Microsoft is closing in on 20% of tablet share and is expected to pass the iPad in the next few years. This is not just Surface but the Windows tablets. They are the largest growth segment in tablets. Microsoft has gone from 0% to over 10% in only about 2 years.<p>So for those that wonder about UWP and apps for phones - they are coming because of these 2-in-1s. This is why Satya Nadella has asked for some patience. This 1010data info is for retail industry and it is how many (like Best Buy) will determine what to stock, what to push, etc.<p>In other words, the Microsoft Surface is the IT tablet for right now. Microsoft has managed to create a major brand that is looked at as a quality one while also using it as a halo brand that can filter down to other OEMs.<p>Do not be surprised if we find out by this time next year that Windows tablets overall have surpassed the iPad. And as the Surface surges and UWP becomes more viable, the opportunity of have a Surface convergence device that can be a phone emerges as an interesting concept to reboot the idea of what Windows is on mobile.<p>Everyone is so focused on right now where Android seems insurmountable and Apple is strong. Both will continue to be viable for a long time, but Microsoft is putting together an alternative narrative that allows consumption and production on single devices and on a single OS. We&#x27;re only at the beginning of the UWP salvo.<p>The report is solid, but limited. Brick and mortar retailers aren&#x27;t counted here - and that includes Apple Stores. Of course, physical Microsoft Stores are not counted either, but they are a much smaller group.<p>Did overall Surface sales trump the iPad? Likely not. But there&#x27;s a reason why Apple was compelled to make the iPad Pro. The Surface is a REAL danger to them. For them to mock it and then backtrack when it has succeeded tells you all you need to know.<p>And the Surface is becoming the key to UWP. If it remains a hot item, it remains an attractive target for developers.",1449868644

Insofar as the universe being a nightmarish phantasmagoria in most places and continued human existence a &#x27;good&#x27; thing on the order of a miracle, those are perceptions of mind, not objective realities.<p>That is, if the scientific revolution in the West has disabused us of fairy-tale notions of love, mercy, equality from a Creator, simply by doing away with the creator, it does not follow that that leaves only misery, horror, desolation, etc. in their absence. The Eastern philosophers remind us that such dualities of good/bad, love/hate, bliss/horror, are projections of mind onto reality, not states of the universe. If you get rid of one, you have necessarily gotten rid of the other, because they are interdependent, like two sides of a coin. The actual reality is neutral.",1449867789

One can rent/lease a car on a month-to-month basis nowadays, yet when you crunch the numbers for continuous use, ownership makes sense.<p>A rental has a certain set of expectations on maintenance and cleanliness, and maintaining those expectations come at a higher price, whereas most people are not strictly adhering to manufacturer&#x27;s maintenance schedules and don&#x27;t wash/vacuum their cars on the daily basis.<p>As one moves away from urban centers, the cost of getting the car <i>to</i> them as well as getting it back to the owner <i>from</i> them is becoming higher, and whoever is in charge of those rentals has to incorporate those costs into the final price, which might or might not be competitive with outright ownership.",1449867768

It would be better to have another dev or a different team such as automation engineers writing regression automation tests. Automating regression tests is definitely better than manual QA-ing the same 1000 tests over and over again. There has to be a good balance. Have extensive coverage of automated regression tests and let manual QA test new features. This will at least increase the frequency of release cycles. Getting rid of an entire QA dept is somewhat equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.",1449867751

Traditional manual QA is highly effective, so much so, that you can get huge gains by automating it. QA occurs at many levels and it makes sense to have a dedicated QA team for each level. Generally, the QA team for a level should be the exact people who requested and/or approved the specific feature subject to QA, as they are in the best position to confirm or deny that the feature meets the specification, as they created and/or approved it.",1449867741

In my experience, third or fourth-year grad students -- who often have friendly peers scattered throughout the university, who have spent much time comparing life in one research group to life in another, and who know where to find good beer at reasonable prices -- are the ones who are most likely to give you glimpses of the cold, hard facts, instead of merely a beautifully crafted line of funding-agency-ready marketing copy. If all you do is look at hallway posters and chat with profs, you won't learn anything that you can't learn from reading journal articles or attending a conference in your field.<p>If you're interested in applications of AI, consider trying to find some local companies (the letters ""ITA"" come to mind here... to say nothing of ""iRobot"") and asking them for ""informational interviews"". From the sound of your CV, companies might well be willing to have someone spend an hour talking to you, just on spec. Be prepared to detach them politely if they cling to your leg and beg you to join the technical staff.",1213106210

Every once in a while we'd run into a bad experience with a site we used. An online bank, FedEx, PayPal, etc.<p>So, as one-part experiment, one-part promotion, and one-part just plain fun, we'd redesign one (or a couple) pages to show what we'd do with the concept/site if we had the chance.",1213106137
213856,comment,213647,213647,0,0,sofal,,,"I like cats, percussion, and certain kinds of absurd humor. Even humor as absurd as Ren and Stimpy sometimes. I'm curious if anyone else enjoyed Ren and Stimpy back in the day, since I've found it to be somewhat polarizing (you either loved it or you thought it was the most disgusting crap you'd ever seen).",1213106044
213855,comment,213418,213712,0,0,gcv,,,"""Free (arguably) open CIL, languages, document format, IDE, documentation.""<p>Actually, Visual Studio Express doesn't even include a profiler, IIRC. The profiler is included only in the much more expensive enterprisey Visual Studio team edition (or whatever the hell it's called). All of Apple's developer tools are completely free and come with OS installation DVDs. Apple's compilers are based on gcc, and, per terms of the GPL, Apple's patches are sent back to gcc's maintainers.<p>""Meanwhile 4000 devs are going to make ALL the applications that the masses could ever want on an iPhone.""<p>Where did you get this idea? 4000 people are in the beta, and there is no reason to believe that Apple won't let absolutely anyone on Earth develop iPhone apps as soon as the SDK reaches its final release.<p>""Heck, why isn't it free to push open source projects?... It seems like they have it out for open source / small business / hackers.""<p>The iPhone App Store is free of charge to developers who choose to release free software, so I have no idea what you're complaining about. The store also lets independent developers set their own pricing. If you don't like that you can't just zap apps from iPhone to iPhone, (1) that's mainly done for safety reasons, and (2) you actually can, with the ad hoc signing mechanism discussed in WWDC keynote.",1213106026

213853,comment,213737,213737,0,0,bbgm,,,"I don't read Techcrunch unless someone points me to a story that sounds like it might be interesting which is rare.  However, people seem to read, and their traffic hasn't suffered, so I doubt that the site is going to change anything soon.  For that matter, who cares what Techcruch is writing about. By moaning about it here, we're giving it airtime that could be used for something more useful.  Ignore it, and perhaps others will too over time (or they'll change their focus).<p>Yes, the site has influence, but to think it's the only way to get noticed is only adding fuel to the fire.",1213105647

I guess some of those stuff are just signs that you have some qualities that good hackers have. They don't make you good, practice and hard work makes you good. Something that's been troubling me is that my weirdness is much bigger than my actual programming skills and i felt like i haven't earned my privilege to be that kind of person. So I've been working on my coding skills harder lately and i hope to earn my right to be weird and arrogant an annoying to people that bore me, now im just some confused kid :D ""attitude is no substitute for confidence"" said someone wise(don't remember where I've read it) So if you think that you can go to an interview and act like some weirdo cat lover, you better be able to back up your self with some mad skills :D",1213105351

8060997,comment,8060699,8060699,19,0,idunning,,,"Comprehensive! Covers the Lisp-y influences of Julia in great depth.<p>My perspective on Julia is that it has 3 ingredients:<p>1. A principled design that derives from the experiences of past programming language and particularly the creator&#x27;s experiences with Lisps. This is where a lot of the &quot;magic&quot; comes from: multiple dispatch, the type system, metaprogramming, etc. The article covers this aspect.<p>2. A need to be accessible to those transitioning from other languages, like MATLAB and Python. MATLAB, for example, has guided function naming (although Numpy also has similar names for similar reasons). The author mentions the lack of distinction between creating a variable and changing its binding: I&#x27;d suggest this is an example of something affected by this design point.<p>3. A need to be fast. The author brings up the Int vs BigInt distinction. Python, for example, allows Ints to get as big as you want but at a cost. Adding to Ints is not simply an add instruction, you must do a lot more work. Julia, falling on the side of performance, elects to distinguish between arbitrary BigInts and machine Int.",1405879007

The most important DNS security flaw is the last-mile problem between browsers and nameservers, and DNSSEC has practically nothing to say about that. DNSCurve, as a counterexample, does solve this problem, and it solves it regardless of whether 1 person deploys it or 300 million do. But all the oxygen has been stolen by DNSSEC.<p>* It provides a setting for us to transition the CA system from untrustworthy companies directly to world governments, with the most commercially important domain names giving CA-like authority to (wait for it) the US government.<p>* Any way you try to project the math out, it will be ludicrously expensive to deploy (the deployment numbers we see today are, effectively, trial/pilot deployments, since virtually no end-user software cares about DNSSEC).<p>* Speaking of expensive: since virtually no modern networking software is built on the assumption that there can be (a) transient (b) security failures for DNS lookups, actually deploying DNSSEC is going to require forklift upgrades to huge amounts of already deployed code. Just to make that clear: imagine you&#x27;re still using gethostbyname() to look up names, like lots of code does. How does your lookup code change to accommodate the fact that a query can, under DNSSEC, (a) fail (b) despite the fact that there was a response to the query with a usable record? TLS solves this with a pop-up dialog. Where does the dialog go?<p>* The most common mode of deployment for DNSSEC leaks hostnames; it essentially re-enables public zone transfers. To avoid this problem, you can theoretically deploy minimum-covering NSEC (&quot;whitelies&quot;), but despite the fact that this is the only &quot;safe&quot; way to deploy DNSSEC, it&#x27;s not the default. Why? Because whitelies requires online keys, and the original premise of DNSSEC was to keep keys offline. Net result: many many deployers of DNSSEC --- should we be so unfortunate as to have many deployers of DNSSEC --- will accidentally leak the contents of their zones to the Internet.<p>This is a subset of the reasons I don&#x27;t like DNSSEC (a more significant one to me is that I believe it&#x27;s cryptographically obsolete); it&#x27;s just the subset that, off the top of my head, I think demonstrates the harm DNSSEC would do beyond simply not solving the problem it ostensibly solves.",1405878421

Usually as soon as RT gets semi-real-time for simplistic scenes at a rather-too-low resolution (without AA), consumers move on to double the previous standard resolution (four times per-pixel workload) such as the move from FHD to retina/hiDPI, we&#x27;re back to square one. Especially if say you find you need 4 split-screens stereoscopic at 4k with full shading fidelity.<p>Rasterization is just too cool of a hack to avoid the tracing of primary rays. In fact, it&#x27;s rather all the hardware and software hacks that evolved <i>around rasterization</i> for 2 decades combined that make it so, not rasterization by itself per se. Various GPU & CPU based culling methods, early & hierarchical Z-buffer, today&#x27;s realtime rendering pipeline is an amazing combination of cool techniques that keeps getting better. Raytracers say &quot;pff, with real raytracing we wouldn&#x27;t need all those dirty hacks&quot;, <i>but</i> for one most of them come with the GPU or are well-known and intuitive to implement, <i>plus</i> to get anywhere near-realtime they need to implement another set of even more (and less comprehensible/intuitive/hardware-accelerated) hacks of their own.<p>All shading stages are also designed around rasterization and matured over the last decade. It&#x27;s good fun to write some pixel-shader-based raytracer but that alone doesn&#x27;t make it the better fit for current/next-gen gamedev at all.<p>The oft-antipicated &quot;hybrid&quot; approach however is finally arriving. Once you have some &quot;depth-aware screen-space&quot; (whether voxelized or N-layers), you can shoot specialized and rather simple rays to create diverse outstanding effects in post-process, from much smoother water surfaces to of course &quot;screen-space raytraced reflections&quot; (SSRR).",1405877036

Special relativity is preserved inside the warp field, but the contents are perceived to move at FTL speeds from the external frames.  Such a classical warp drive cannot avoid the temporal paradox (i.e, time travel).  If quantum systems are the only system that permits backward-in-time causality without temporal paradox, then any rational warp drive will need to be based on quantum principles.  This means that until we have a workable theory of quantum gravity; research into warp drives based on General Relativity is probably doomed to failure.”",1405876118

That should show up in a longitudinal test: you would expect that as people develop a model, they switch from the failing to passing groups.<p>This would be consistent with the sequential learning model.

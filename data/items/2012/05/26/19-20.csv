The energy required to produce both solar and wind energy has decreased significantly in recent years.<p>Solar power in Germany (the page claims) takes between 15 - 100 months to generate as much energy as producing them takes. I assume 100 is for old panels, and with modern (=more efficiently produced) panels it's more like 15. Wind power takes just 3 - 23 months to establish this ""energy payback"".<p>The page has more detailed figures and sources.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volker-quaschning.de/datserv/kev/index.php</a>",1338062254

4028163,comment,4027954,4027954,7,0,cynicalkane,,,"It's interesting what happened that day. At the opening of FB stock, Nasdaq tried to match about 75 million shares' worth of buys and asks--the 'opening cross'. However, if any one of those trades were updated, Nasdaq's engine was programmed to partially or completely throw out the cross and try again, resulting in an infinite loop since they couldn't calculate the cross fast enough every time there was an update. This is a pretty basic mistake in a system designed to process lots of events in real-time.<p>Nanex always likes to cast HFT as the villain of everything that goes wrong with the market--this is silly. HFT makes nothing but money for Nasdaq, and narrows spreads for investors. It was pretty clearly Nasdaq's job to handle the volume of information and not falter due to such a dumb mistake as other networks kept chugging along.<p>The same bug also affected trading in Zynga later that day on lower volume when trading closed and re-opened on that stock. This to my mind makes Nasdaq look guiltier. It's like they didn't even test what would happen handling a big cross under load.",1338061905

It's hard to make everyone happy, so it's probably better for Apple to let the carriers fight over coverage than to try to compete head-on.<p>For example, Apple the carrier might find that a city isn't profitable to cover, so they avoid it. However, a regional carrier might find it to be. So if Apple had their own carrier, they lose out on any customers there. But, if they allowed that regional carrier to sell the iPhone, then they can keep the customer.<p>I don't think it has anything to do with having a scapegoat for poor performance, or lack of ability to run a carrier. I just don't think it is in their interest to start one. Because, let's face it, this is Apple... They wouldn't be satisfied with running a #3 or #4 carrier, they would want to do it right - and be everywhere. And that is very expensive.",1338061801

I could live frugally in Wichita, KS, but I'd probably prefer living frugally in NYC instead.<p>Manhattan is weird in that even a six-figure income doesn't guarantee you a moderately nice apartment in the trendy neighborhoods, but when incomes are adjusted for cost-of-living, New York is actually relatively cheap compared to many US cities. Part of it is that New Yorkers are <i>incredibly</i> idiosyncratic in terms of what purchases we prioritize.<p>For example, New Yorkers value location and environment/surroundings over material possessions, like cars (which we rarely own) and even the size/quality of our living space. We spend far less time at home than our suburban counterparts, so we're willing to settle for spaces that might seem less desirable to non-New Yorkers. So if you try to buy the same basket of goods that you'd buy in Wichita, yes, you'll find it very expensive - but most New Yorkers allocate their disposable income very differently.<p>(Also remember that uptown and/or the outer boroughs are always an option - Harlem is cheap and surprisingly accessible, especially if you live near an express stop.)<p>> Living in Manhattan turned me into a horrible person.<p>Living anywhere that doesn't suit your lifestyle will make you miserable. I'm sorry that Manhattan wasn't for you, but I hope you don't hold it against my city, just the same way I wouldn't hold it against wherever you're currently living that I'd likely be unhappy there as well.",1338061397

That doesn't mean they can operate a carrier.<p>Another major obstacle is that it would be insanely expensive to just buy a major carrier like Verizon and then only support iPhones on it. You'd have tons of underutilized network infrastructure, and you'd have to support third-party phones. You could keep operating it as a general carrier and sell other phones, but why would Apple do that? There's also the possibility of operating an MVNO, but then you can't control the quality of the underlying network.<p>I'm sure the idea has been discussed at Apple and they've come to similar conclusions.",1338060328

(LGPL requires that those modifications <i>to the original library</i> be relicensed under the LGPL as well).<p>Not sure what that translated to in the context of this project, but presumably they believe people want to be able to extend the library itself while keeping their modifications proprietary.",1338059197

The consistency and compactness and fast compilation of the language make it a joy to work in and the concurrency features and packages for basic http and web sockets etc make it great for wiring up distributed infrastructure. The standard go packages for http are so much better then the python ones it isn't even funny.<p>We leave our processes running for months and memory usage stays quite low and stability good which is surprising considering the minimal time spent in development (note: we run on 64 bit linux). (Actually the other day I realized we had generated 24 gb log file because no one had restarted the master process in months.)<p>We still use other languages for linear algebra heavy things or things that benefit from a more complete webframework (in terms of both features and documentation) but I am hoping the go ecosystem develops in those areas.",1338059192

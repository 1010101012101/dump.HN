Further you have not proven,<p>> then you construct this elaborate straw man about how the technology itself is gender agnostic [...] and that the gender issues are in society as a whole<p>is factually wrong.  You admit that technology as a whole is gender agnostic, so you actually agree with my premise.<p>And actually I have acknowledged that there is sexism in tech because it is progressed by individuals (read: people) that come from a society.  That society provides the context to their actions and motivations, regardless of which industry they are employed in (though each industry will vary in specifics).  When one limits the discussion to <i>only</i> the tech industry they prevent any comparisons to other industries, both at a specific point in time as well as long-term / trends, which limits the ability to judge and measure progress.  Limiting the judging to merely internal progress means that one will be unsure if that industry is progressing faster or slower than other industries wrt whatever we&#x27;re discussing (in this case, gender issues in tech).  In addition, it prevents people from discussing where industry A has made progress that industry B can look to, or learn from the mistakes of industry C.  That is not possible if the discussion is silo-ed within <i>only</i> a single industry.<p>Also, what do Caucasians have to do with gender?  That came out of no where, how is that relevant to this?  You also seem to imply that I don&#x27;t believe I could ever make a sexist comment or action, yet I never stated that, so why would you imply that?  You&#x27;re projecting yourself onto my words, please stop, it&#x27;s disingenuous.<p>Welp, here&#x27;s a thesis that concludes that men who treat women equally are seen as treating women as inferiors - <a href=""https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6958/Yeung_Amy.pdf?sequence=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6958/Yeu...</a><p>So if that thesis can be reproduced, then all gender issues need to be reexamined as they&#x27;d be tainted by bias of treating men who treat women equally as men who are sexist.<p>You haven&#x27;t actually proven anything I&#x27;ve said to be incorrect, you&#x27;ve just tried to take it out of context and ignore some points here and there as a means to discredit my words and intentions.  I&#x27;m sorry I treat people equally (we&#x27;re all individual nodes in this big cog of society) and other people do not, but the fact remains, the framing of the discussion is inherently limiting to making progress by limiting the scope and depth of such a discussion.",1422071924
8938762,comment,8938727,8938727,0,0,MalcolmDiggs,,,"Well, remember that equity is typically either completely worthless, or worth an enormous amount. That is: You can either cash out for incredible sums of money (after an IPO for example), or just sit on your illiquid equity that can&#x27;t be sold even if there was a willing buyer.<p>In the unlikely event that your equity is EVER worth anything, the difference between 0.1% and 1% and 10% is the difference between you being super-rich, or super-duper-rich, or super-duper-mega-rich. Not a meaningful difference for many, as far as the incentive structures go.<p>Keeping the slices small allows the company to scale out and make sure that dozens or hundreds of its early employees will become very wealthy when the IPO happens. In many people&#x27;s eyes, this is better than having a smaller early team get even richer. If the first 100 people all get 0.1%, you&#x27;ve only given out a total of 10% of the company, but every single one of those people are gonna be ridiculously wealthy in an IPO, and so you can motivate an entire early team that way...and increase your overall likelihood of hitting that payoff some day.",1422071921

8938755,comment,8936952,8937339,0,0,waps,,,"Lifespan is a function of organism size (ironically measured in weight, mostly). The bigger an organism, the longer it&#x27;s lifespan. Keeping in mind normal human lifespan would be about 30-35 years, you find that many animals of similar size have a natural lifespan within a factor 2 or so of a formula that also applies to humans. Normal whales, for instance, have a natural lifespan of about 70 years.<p>That this formula works would seem to indicate that you are right. Death is natural, but it&#x27;s &quot;planned&quot;. The easiest way for such a formula to work would be that your genes somehow contain a death clock.<p>But there are multiple death clocks. One limits number of cell divisions. There is another one known that limits the amount of energy that can pass through a cell, after which it will kill itself. There are various others, one that kills the cell if it isn&#x27;t deactivated on a regular basis (presumably meant as a check on DNA integrity), one that is triggered from the outside of the cell, ... the list goes on.",1422071452

8938751,comment,8938223,8938603,0,0,dannyobrien,,,"Hi, Danny O&#x27;Brien from EFF, and the person who wrote the headline and the paragraph.<p>I&#x27;d say the headline is actually in this case more accurate, but I didn&#x27;t really want to add another six paragraphs of insider politics to the blog post to explain why. Long-form HN comment readers are a different matter, of course, so here goes:<p>It&#x27;s true there are three more readings in the Lords, but my understanding (and recollection from when I worked more on HoP issues) is that the majority of these are pretty perfunctory, especially with a bill like this which has a high government priority to get through before the end of the current Parliament. Essentially, once these amendments hitch a ride on the process, it will get steadily more difficult to unmoor them. They will cease to become amendments, and more a small part of a very important bill.<p>Rejecting amendments like this at any step is an unusual act, especially when they are promoted by peers with apparent strong domain knowledge. It&#x27;s absolutely impossible if you don&#x27;t actually have <i>time</i> to debate the details.<p>So what you have to do is to alert politicians to a procedural violation instead. Few politicians are experts on Internet surveillance, so wil not feel confident to go up against domain experts; all of them are experts, however, on the exact moments they might be being bypassed or steamrollered over. That&#x27;s because they&#x27;re politicians and human beings, and being sensitive to possible cheating among your peers (pun not intended) is built into their psychology.<p>That moment of steamrollering is on Monday. If the amendments go through on the nod on Monday without a fuss, then the moment will be lost where we can argue about a violation of procedure. After that, we will have to argue about the substance of the bill. And there is no parliamentary time allotted for arguments of substance, because the whole <i>point</i> of inserting these 18 pages of amendments so quickly is to bypass that debate.<p>TLDR; yes, there are other opportunities. No, we&#x27;re really not confident at all that we could stop the bill at those points. The best and possibly only probable chance to stop the Snooper&#x27;s Charter is on Monday.<p>(For those wondering how you even begin to make these calculations: EFF works with the Open Rights Group, Britain&#x27;s own awesome digital rights group. ORG&#x27;s advisory bench includes MPs and peers, so they walk us both through the probabilities. <a href=""https://www.openrightsgroup.org/people/advisory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.openrightsgroup.org/people/advisory</a> )<p>Hope this helps.",1422071392

I can look at a car engine, and if I stare at it long enough, I can make sense of it. The engine makes sense to me not just because it was designed by another human but also because its design is non-random. When I stare at the protein KcsA, which is the biological system that I study, I cannot make sense of its design. My conclusion is that its design is an outcome of chance. The protein works and has a design but it is not one that I can figure out.<p>Man made machines have a rational design. Biological systems have an &quot;<i>irrational</i>&quot; design.

8938734,comment,8936701,8938471,0,0,pb2au,,,"Hi again,<p><i>No. Copyright can be used to protect moral rights, [...]. In places where moral rights are in the law, they are not subject to copyright at all.</i><p><i>It doesn&#x27;t matter. [...] Whether there are legal systems without copyright is irrelevant to this.</i><p>Sorry, I think we are just disagreeing on the definition of copyright here.  I use the definition that moral rights are under the umbrella of copyright.  For example, Wikipedia defines moral rights as &quot;<i>rights of creators of copyrighted works</i> generally recognized in civil law jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some common law jurisdictions&quot; [1].  You could have moral rights without property rights, but not without copyright.  And, again, I don&#x27;t think there are any countries that actually have moral rights without property rights, which I do consider important for discussing the claim that respecting property rights is unnecessary.<p><i>What licenses would those be, if there&#x27;s no copyright? You&#x27;re still thinking in a matter formatted by the current US law.</i><p>You claimed that moral rights were important, but property rights were not (or maybe I&#x27;ve misunderstood).  The MIT license is generally protective of moral rights (attribution), while the GPL protects both moral rights and property rights (attribution and &quot;you may use the code under these conditions&quot;).  By saying moral rights are only important, it&#x27;s the same as saying any GPL code could be re-licensed under the MIT license.  So the situation I mentioned was using previously GPLed code in a closed-source binary, because the company does not respect the copyright (property rights) of the author, even if they keep the attribution (moral rights).<p>The original topic discussed was: &quot;If you believe in open source, then you need to be respectful of copyright law. It is the foundation for open source licensing.&quot;<p>Which I think is made clear by the example.  By nobody respecting property rights, closed-source binaries could use GPLed code, with the stipulation that the binaries themselves can be reverse engineered legally.  It isn&#x27;t a good trade-off.  The binaries are no longer proprietary (i.e. have ownership rights), but are still very hard to use.<p><i>As I said earlier, a law could be promulgated that granted the author the right only to prevent others from using code written by him in proprietary binaries - while not granting him/her the right to restrict any other copying.</i><p>This itself sounds like a copyright law that grants certain property rights to the author.  Earlier you mentioned abolishing &quot;economic rights&quot; and stated &quot;essentially, the attribution right is the goal&quot;.  But, as it turns out, some property rights are liked (&quot;I made this, so I want to release it under X condition!&quot;), so if you expect others to respect your terms, it is important to respect theirs, imo.<p>That&#x27;s why I consider respecting copyright to be important for open source -- to me it seems like the &quot;golden rule&quot; of authoring code; if I want my GPL code to be protected, I should respect the license of their proprietary code.<p>I don&#x27;t have any more time for the discussion, but I think I&#x27;ve expressed my view the best I can.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights</a>",1422071016

For those of us working in the field, it&#x27;s just a fun term, not a legal term. It is used to distinguish the risk of a bug, not the ethical handling of it. It has always been in relation to risk. The risk is greatest when it is a. unknown to anyone but a few b. unknown by a wide enough audience to effect its application c. unfixable or as yet unpatched. Some in the field call bugs fitting any one of these qualification 0days, other&#x27;s not. But nearly no one in the field uses this term to quantify the ethical handling of a bug (as in: age starting from moment vendor knows about bug).<p>Consider what a 1day is. A &quot;1day&quot; bug is one that looses value because it is likely that some systems have now been patched such that you as an attacker are not guaranteed that <i>every</i> system you touch with your exploit will fall. A 365day is likely useless, depending on the target platform. Hence, the entirety of its meaning has to do with risk, not procedure or ethics.<p>It is fine if you read Wikipedia&#x27;s definition and decide the meaning is otherwise. After all, language changes. But if anyone in the future wants to understand the etymology of the meaning behind &quot;0day&quot; they should consider that the meaning appears to have changed (in the minds of many that actually don&#x27;t even work in the field of reverse engineering).",1422070188

    the competition with all the wisdom they gained at 
    Accenture, McKinsey, BCG, Bain, or some big IL firm.
  - Does NOT have a technical co-founder but is being advised
    by some guy with a similar pedigree that attended a coding 
    bootcamp/wrote a crappy iOS app/got a CS degree...

And in terms of equity compensation Chicago isn&#x27;t even in the same league as SV today. Getting >0.25% as the initial engineering hire is extremely rare here - even at companies that lack a technical co-founder.<p>This causes younger talent to get sucked to the coasts.<p>3) Many of the startups do not actively cultivate a technology or engineering culture.

My biggest problem with the original article is simply that it doesn&#x27;t mention that setting up a dead man&#x27;s switch could expose somebody to a legitimate charge of destruction of evidence or contempt of court.  That seems like an important detail.<p>I&#x27;ll accept your argument that there may be valid reasons for innocent people to set up a dead man&#x27;s switch, but even so it&#x27;s irresponsible to tell people &quot;look at this cool thing you can do&quot; without mentioning that doing it could -- in some circumstances -- lead to jail time and legal bills.<p>Yes, if I set up a dead man&#x27;s switch and am never investigated, it will never be triggered, and I will never face charges because of it.  But then the police will never know that the thing existed, so they would have no reason to believe that lots of innocent people are using dead man&#x27;s switches for legitimate purposes.<p>I would still insist on a disclaimer if the advice only increased the chance somebody would be charged with a crime, even if it were impossible to be convicted.  I don&#x27;t believe everything should carry a disclaimer, but I do believe that if I&#x27;m aware of a nonobvious risk, I should mention it.<p>Years ago, I was a teller for BB&T bank.  When the economy started slowing down in early 2001, and our competitors announced layoffs, the CEO sent out a memo stating that BB&T didn&#x27;t plan any layoffs and that the CEO thought the company had a bright future.  As proof of that bright future, he mentioned that he was &quot;fully vested&quot; in the company, i.e., his only investments were cash and BB&T stock, and he swore that he would not sell his stock because a captain has a duty to go down with the ship.  It&#x27;s certainly legal to put all of your investments in one company, but it&#x27;s generally considered a risky move, so the CEO also included a disclaimer that he wasn&#x27;t suggesting we put all of our money in BB&T stock.  But he wanted us to know that he either sincerely believed in the company, or was willing to risk a fortune pretending to.<p>> > Considering Tor: I&#x27;m perfectly OK recommending people check sports scores and read Wikipedia through Tor in the US or other Western countries; but I would feel irresponsible giving that advice to people in, say, North Korea or Iran.<p>> Shouldn&#x27;t it feel more uncomfortable than this casting the US into a comparison with North Korea and Iran? It seems like it should feel more uncomfortable than this.<p>I&#x27;m feeling the smugness, but I&#x27;m not able to figure out the logic behind it.  My complaint with the original article is that it gives advice without mentioning the consequences for following that advice.  My list of things that should include disclaimers is based on my understanding of US law and the potential consequences of using Tor, secure HTTP connections, encrypted email, etc.  It seems obvious to me that the list of things that should include disclaimers under various legal regimes will be influenced by the consequences of taking those actions in those regimes.  Indeed, mentioning that the consequences of using Tor, encrypted email, etc. are different in the US than in North Korea (or Iran, or Saudi Arabia, or Cuba, depending on who&#x27;s on the other end of the connection) seems to me to be a compliment to the US.",1422069729

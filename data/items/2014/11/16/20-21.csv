8615407,comment,8615224,8615341,0,0,gwern,,,"> In 1935 Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen published a thought experiment that seemed to produce a paradox in quantum mechanics, as well as demonstrating that it was incomplete.  Their argument used the fact that there can be an apparent instantaneous interaction in the measurement of two separated particles that have been prepared in a certain &quot;entangled&quot; manner.  Einstein called it &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;.  It has been shown by Eberhard that no information can be passed using this effect; so there is no FTL communication, but the paradox is still very controversial.  See the FAQ article The EPR Paradox and Bell&#x27;s Inequality for more details.",1416171537

8615404,comment,8614516,8614516,0,0,tokenadult,,,"This is a very good article. The reference to the newly published book <i>Faster, Higher, Stronger: How Sports Science Is Creating a New Generation of Superathletes--and What We Can Learn from Them</i> by Mark McClusky prompted me to request that book from my friendly public library. I like how the article looks at the absolute skill levels among professional competitors in chess and professional performers in orchestral music and shows that the skill level in those and many other domains has been steadily rising in my lifetime. There is still a lot of untapped potential in most individuals alive today that can be developed even at adult ages.<p>As the article reports, &quot;What we’re seeing is, in part, the mainstreaming of excellent habits. In the late nineteen-fifties, Raymond Berry, the great wide receiver for the Baltimore Colts, was famous for his attention to detail and his obsessive approach to the game: he took copious notes, he ate well, he studied film of his opponents, he simulated entire games by himself, and so on. But, as the journalist Mark Bowden observed, Berry was considered an oddball. The golfer Ben Hogan, who was said to have &#x27;invented practice,&#x27; stood out at a time when most pro golfers practiced occasionally, if at all. Today, practicing six to eight hours a day is just the price of admission on the P.G.A. Tour. Everyone works hard. Everyone is really good.&quot; This kind of cultural change can still go a lot further in a lot of fields on human performance. A culture of continual efforts at self-improvement has hardly even begun in many occupations.<p>The article&#x27;s conclusion about improving the performance of elementary and secondary school teachers in the United States is thoughtful, and also refers to good new books, <i>Building a Better Teacher</i> by Elizabeth Green and <i>The Teacher Wars</i> by Dana Goldstein. Studies of educational effectiveness in the United States consistently show that the variance in teacher quality in any one school swamps the variance in school quality between one school and another, so any child in any school district is at risk of getting an ineffective teacher. (Although schools in poor neighborhoods of the United States, on the whole, have the greatest difficulty in hiring and retaining good teachers.) Anything that can help teachers learn to teach better before or after they began working in the classroom will have massive social benefits. An economist who has studied teacher effectiveness for years shows that the best teachers are almost literally worth their weight in gold, while the worst teachers have negative added value for their pupils.[1] Bringing a culture of continual self-improvement in America&#x27;s schools is a project of crucial national importance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-how-much-good-teacher-worth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-h...</a>",1416171505

8615382,comment,8614113,8614609,0,0,scott_s,,,"I don&#x27;t recall this specific circumstance being a problem with lock-free memory allocation. The semantics of malloc itself help you; when someone frees memory, they&#x27;re asserting that they&#x27;re allowed to do it. If they use that memory again, then that&#x27;s their fault, not yours (when we&#x27;re the one implementing the memory allocator).<p>We can also avoid this problem because scalable memory allocators try to minimize different threads touching the same parts of the internal data structure. This is counter to, say, trying to implement a lock-free red black tree. There, the whole point is that multiple threads will all touch the same state.<p>The allocator I worked on maintained lock-free queues for remote frees. We would sometimes deallocate these queues entirely - but we knew this was safe because we would only do it when all of the chunks of memory attached to these queues were free. If there was a dangling pointer somewhere, that was an <i>application error</i>.<p>Data structures inside memory allocators serve a different purpose than data structures inside typical applications. When you have, say, a tree in your application, you very much care about the actual <i>data</i> stored in it. Your payload - the entire point of having the data structure - is the particular data stored somewhere in the tree. If you want, say, the element with the key &quot;ABCD&quot;, then no other element will do. The payload for the data structures in a memory allocator is just chunks of memory. If you&#x27;re doing an allocation, then any chunk will do. If you&#x27;re doing a free, you need to free that particular chunk, but you can also assume that no one else will free it.",1416170915

It used to be that in early April all the local farms would open their roadside stands within a week of each other. They would all shut down around the same time too. Many of them now open in February or March and sell strawberries into early Fall.<p>- The strawberries now look and taste different than they did when I was a kid (i.e. the 1980s). They used to be smaller, sweeter and red all the way through. The strawberries you get now are often white inside (unripe?), less sweet and much larger. There is one local farm [1] whose strawberries are so big it&#x27;s freaky.<p>- Some friends of mine lived in a neighborhood surrounded by strawberry and other other produce fields.

Both of them became lazy and uninterested after a few months and quit as soon as we ran out of money.<p>I worked at it for almost a year, alone with a part time admin assistant.<p>Managed to pay back the seed money and &quot;live through&quot; that year but ended up very tired and still broke.<p>Variant 2:<p>One day I get a call from a MBA in a similar industry and he was very excited about the model. I was tired, broke and felt lonely, I easily got convinced to re-launch under a new name for a broader market. (original was in french)<p>Created a whole new business, new name, new website, new everything.

We were not even putting our new version in front of clients yet and he was panicking.<p>He forced a shut down of the business. It was the second time I was building this model - was still broke and exhausted.<p>Variant 3:<p>I felt relived and thought I&#x27;d go work a day job for a little while. Then 3 days later I&#x27;m sitting with one of the client of the first business and for him it made such a difference that he trying to convince me to try again and offered 100k in investment.<p>Worked my ass off again for launch #3 - except this one I was aiming for the stars and had 100k in bank. \nMade a huge mistake in hiring technical talent, took us months to get a shitty product out.\nMade a huge mistake in hiring admin talent, burnt through 15k until we had to stop working with that person.\nAnd worst, 6 months in, as we&#x27;re trying to hit it really hard we realize that the real estate markets we were after slowed down dramatically (40%-50% drop in sales)<p>So we ran a test campaign and indeed, it confirmed a huge drop.<p>I had to cut on every aspects of the business, let go of hires, go back to the plan and do a lot of thinking. We managed to survive a few months but it was extremely hard to get money out of clients because they knew the market was down and felt like they would waste money by investing in our platform in such a downturn.<p>We had to pivot our business model and our client approach multiple times in the last 3 months. Which in retrospective brought me tremendous knowledge and made us try new innovative tactics to help my clients and show them that we could be trusted.<p>Slowly but surely we&#x27;ve started to generate revenue and I&#x27;m proud to say that in the last few weeks we&#x27;ve actually hit our target, we&#x27;re no longer digging ourselves in a hole.<p>I&#x27;m now still completely broke but at least I can pay our team every week and I know that it&#x27;s not just money that we borrowed but money that we earned and I&#x27;m confident in our new way of doing things.<p>Reiteration works.

In any area where you don&#x27;t have experience, it helps to listen first, and learn more, before jumping in.  I spent a long time lurking on LKML before I started hacking on Linux.  I spent a long time reading about FOSS licenses before I started dealing with licensing issues.<p>The reaction you&#x27;re getting is a lot like the reaction you&#x27;d get if, in response to an intricate kernel patch, you asked questions (and made some incorrect assumptions) about basic C programming concepts.  In general, the comments or discussion surrounding someone&#x27;s experiences with harassment are not a good place to ask intro-level questions.

The phrase\n&quot;Yellow Pages&quot; is known and descriptive, but in the US it is over-used\nsince a lot of companies use it due to the lack of a trademark. It fails\nto be distinct.

Having a bit more general information <i>about</i>\nyour company like history might be a worthy addition. The &quot;What We Do&quot;\nof your company should be concisely expressed on your main home page\nalong with the search form.<p>Grey text on a white(ish) background is very common (like here on hn)\nbut it&#x27;s a terrible choice and is a well known accessibility issue.

Consider the case of zooming in on a region of the fractal. Do you:<p>a) only zoom by fixed integer scalings?<p>or<p>b) have an arbitrary scale represented by a float?<p>In the case of b, this means you need to re-compute what the (fractional) pixel locations are that would correspond to the fixed image size of your viewport.

The world was very different, for example I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if many jobs simply didn&#x27;t make sense for women. Like if they required a lot of physical labor (which presumably was most jobs). So women being excluded from such jobs might not have been active discrimination but simply common sense (as in &quot;not worth considering&quot;). For the other subjects there also were or might have been reasons that simply don&#x27;t exist anymore today. For example it seems likely that marriage and women taking care of the household was about the only way to survive.

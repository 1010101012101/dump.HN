It really isn't much of a big deal, I'm just doing my job.  As the business folk would say it doesn't really ""move the needle"" of my personal career. If, on the other hand, I do the same work and I release it back into the wild, assuming my patch isn't stupid, I gain some respect from people who are likely to help me in the future, and more importantly, I gain a way to prove that I know how to use and modify open source software at my next interview.

On older OS versions (I don't know if this changed with OS X or if it was earlier) you had to hold down the mouse button the whole time you traversed the menu. Letting go of the mouse button over anything but a menu item resulted in closing the menu. You can still do it this way. And now, even though the menus are 'sticky', they close when you click on anything that isn't a menu item. I'm so used to this behavior now that I use it to close menus.

It sucked quite frankly but turned out to be a great learning experience.  It also helped me branch into consulting and the startup that I'm currently at.<p>The worst part was not pulling the plug soon enough.  What kills me is I think the idea is still a good idea (vertical search engine for tv/movie content with alerts for shows you want to watch, close caption searching, recommendations, community site.) I see parts of it being built by others but still not as good as what we had 3 years ago.  I would use the app today if it still lived.<p>The major learning points from the failure are\n1) Bootstrap the company.  Don't require VC funding to get started. We spent to much time chasing after money and not enough getting users\n2) Get customers to pay you money is a lot easier than getting ad revenue. You need a lot of users to make advertising pay off. You only need a few paying customers.\n3) Listen to your gut. We followed the bad advice of an adviser that caused us pivot in the wrong direction and kept us working when we should have pulled the plug.\n4) Release early, release often.  We waited to long to release and start getting users.<p>So the business itself was a failure but I learned a lot of good things and I'm in a better position 3 years later than I would have been if I didn't do the startup.",1282800538

Everyone benefits from it, but the person who develops it isn't directly rewarded.<p>If your only motivation is profit (or you have a duty to maximise profit), there are still some good reasons to release FLOSS software: contributing to other infrastructure projects (especially if it is an established project) will be useful to other people who don't directly compete with you, and if there are lots of contributors, you will likely get more back than what you put in, while still getting the feature you want. In addition, if you make it known that your company is involved in FLOSS development, it is likely to generate good PR amongst technical people. It may also help you get good quality employees who are already familiar with some of your code base.<p>If your aim to make society a better place, without harming profits too much, rather than purely profit, FLOSS development makes even more sense. The risks to watch out for are spending too much time supporting the software, liability issues (nearly all FLOSS licenses include a disclaimer, but it is hard to rule out liability entirely), lowering barriers to entry, and having an unfair disadvantage if competitors use your code or ideas but don't release theirs (the Affero GPL can help with the former - and patenting novel algorithms and licensing them to all services which release their implementations with the latter - but you need to consider whether you have the cashflow to enforce your license / patents anyway).",1282800300

That is, an attempt to create the impression in the market that the Droid is the powerful, bold, masculine device, and so by implication (certainly never stated directly) that the iPhone is the rounded, feminine device. I don't have a marketer's sense about why that'd be an agenda item, but I could guess it may be a tried-and-true PR advertising technique -- if you're coming from behind, try to create an identity issue around the decision that will get you the fraction of the market you think you can get.<p>I think if you try, you can see analogues to this strategy in Apple's marketing, especially when it was famously coming from behind in the ""I'm a Mac"" ads. By attempting to segment the market -- ""If you're a serious older person, PCs are for you, but if you're a young hipster, the Mac is your natural choice."" -- they attempted to artificially create this sort of identity-based split in preference.<p>Again, I'm not a marketer, so I don't know if this is standard playbook or just reading more into what I see. I don't even know if this stuff works, but based on Apple fans' statements, it seems to me the message that they should think of themselves as a young, hip, enlightened minority who ""just get it"" and have great fashion sense seems to have taken root pretty well.",1282799625

1635131,comment,1634471,1634702,0,0,nlogn,,,"Other companies prioritize features over usability.  Apple does not create as feature rich programs, focusing instead on making them simple, easy to use, and aesthetically pleasing.  Google, Microsoft, Linux devs, etc. build more feature-packed, customizable products.  It is difficult to make software both feature rich and yet uncomplicated and easy to approach.  I like the Firefox way of doing things: put commonly needed preferences in menubar->preferences and hide everything else away in a strange place like about:config that the user can find if they need.<p>Personally, I am satisfied with Android 2.2's, Ubuntu's, and even Windows 7's UIs and prefer the richer sets of features (not that I dislike iOS or Apple products; I actually use them at work on a daily basis).  I think there are benefits to doing software both ways and I think the range of program complexity and power in the consumer software market reflects that.",1282799417

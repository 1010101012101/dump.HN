75946,comment,75902,75933,0,0,nickb,,,"Maybe because they're not a preferred format anymore and are antiquated? Seriously, I hate CDs. They're bulky, not ""high density"" enough anymore (one CD holds only 72min of music) and I need to spend 10 min on ripping and encoding them to make them usable in my preferred player (iPod). When is the last time you've seen someone carrying a portable CD player? I think that says it all.<p>Record industry is peddling accessories for buggies and everyone's driving cars now.",1194144740

That is, we find no direct evidence to suggest that the net effect of P2P file-sharing on CD purchasing is either positive or negative for Canada as a whole.<p>>However, our analysis of the Canadian P2P file-sharing subpopulation suggests that there is a strong positive relationship between P2P file-sharing and CD purchasing. That is, among Canadians actually engaged in it, P2P file-sharing increases CD purchasing.<p>So they concluded that file sharing has no overall impact which is a ridiculous conclusion because it seems blindingly obvious that file sharing is hurting CD sales. They concluded that among those that engage in file sharing, those that file share <i>more</i> are likely to buy more music, which makes sense because the most active file sharers are probably the biggest fans of music.",1194144494

Right now that device is the phone. We are still in the novelty phase. It is as seamless as reaching in to your pocket and navigating to the needed app. It is still optional. You can still get printed boarding passes, and most people do.<p>There will be a transition point where this digital &quot;key&quot; (I think this is the best term) becomes mandatory. Retail stores could eliminate shoplifting along with the checkout line. Airports, employers, government facilities, could exercise more precise control of who is on the premises.

We currently have nothing else like that, and all of our advancements into new generations of energy rely on products manufactured with fossil fuels, cheap fossil fuels at that.Even today, we do not have such a resource readily available and as safe as fossil fuels.That being said, &quot;a modern civilization&quot; could come into existence without fossil fuels. I do not doubt the ingenuity of humans whether I am in the same period of time with them or not.My belief on this is based on how our society would be structured when you cannot travel so far away from the epicenter of a city because of the cost of fuel.This type of thought experiment is fun.</i><p>Copy/paste on Android lost the original paragraphs.

9368802,comment,9368031,9368301,0,0,panglott,,,"The problem with wood as a fuel is that any densifying human culture can burn it faster than it grows. Industrial uses compete with household uses for cooking fuel and heating. Europe in the 14th to 16th centuries saw massive deforestation in England, Germany, and elsewhere, and the state had to reserve stands of large timber as a military resource for shipbuilding. This was a significant concern in the early Tudor and Elizabethan era, for example, and the Black Forest reached its smallest extent during this time also, IIRC. Wood for fuel came from intensive coppice stands, and significant wood was imported as well.<p>As the article says: &quot;Wartime gasifier cars could achieve about 1.5 miles per kilogram [of wood].&quot; Comparing the time it takes to grow a kg of wood versus the value of moving a car only 1.5 miles illustrates the problem pretty nicely.<p>Wood is not a sustainable fuel for an industrial civilization, at anything like current rates of consumption.",1428944295

Here, that would be HD + not having to look for a torrent server that isn&#x27;t currently blocked in your country. Just as people rarely try to evade paying their train/tube tickets unless they&#x27;re broke: their time and convenience isn&#x27;t worth that sort of hassle.<p>Had it been a leak of one episode hours before it aired, it wouldn&#x27;t have been detrimental to HBO. But 4 episodes at once mean pirates can get one month worth of binge watching, which is _the_ thing people want and TV channels can&#x27;t offer. That means many paying HBO customers will watch the pirated version and ask themselves why they keep paying their subscription. Even those who choose not to watch the leaked versions, will no doubt experience some amount of frustration due to having to make that choice. And their are other minor inconveniences, such as having to avoid spoilers on forums.<p>Your point would have been completely valid, had GoT been produced by a binge-friendly media such as Netflix, though.",1428943651

9368646,comment,9367235,9367235,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"First off, Agile isn&#x27;t a software development methodology, its a set of principles for an organization to apply in selecting/developing in its own software development methodology (you could call it a software development metamethodology.) Scrum is more of a methodology (and, while it may have emerged from the people involved applying Agile principles in the context in which Scrum was developed, and has features designed to support use in an organization applying Agile principles, there is nothing <i>fundamentally</i> Agile about Scrum -- or any other development methodology; if some decisionmaker is sold on Scrum by some consultants and adopts it as a top down practice, that organization may be doing Scrum, but they aren&#x27;t doing Agile -- in fact, they are doing exactly the thing that Agile is a reaction <i>against</i>.) Almost any time someone uses the phrase &quot;Agile/Scrum&quot; they either mean Scrum or something that is neither Agile nor Scrum. In this case, the criticism seems to be of something that is neither Agile nor Scrum, though it may be <i>related</i> to the latter (but not at all the former.)<p>As to the specific points:<p>1. Here, the claim is: <i>There is no place for an actual senior engineer on a Scrum team. The only way to move up is to become a &quot;Scrum Master&quot;, a bullshit management role that involves responsibility without power.</i><p>There are several errors in this description: First, &quot;Scrum Master&quot; isn&#x27;t management role, its a facilitation role focusing on expertise with making Scrum work in the particular organization. The only quasi-management role on (or related to) a Scrum team defined in the Scrum Guide [0] is the Product Owner (which does have authority to go with that responsibility.) Either of those is a role a team member could develop into; the idea that the SM role is the only &quot;way up&quot; on a Scrum team is incorrect even within the narrow bounds that are defined by Scrum.<p>OTOH, Scrum itself <i>intentionally</i> -- to support its use in organizations using Agile practices -- defines only a narrow slice of practice, particularly, a basic model for operation of individual development teams. It does not prevent having different roles <i>outside of the defined interactions within the Scrum guide</i> for members of different seniorities or specialties, it only requires that <i>for the purposes of the interactions it defines</i>, only a narrow set of roles (&quot;Team Member&quot;, &quot;Product Owner&quot;, &quot;Scrum Master&quot;) matter. So, consistent with Scrum, there can be room for moving up on a team. And real organizations using Scrum on projects greater than a single 3-9 member team use complementary practices like the Scrum of Scrums [1]; being a Scrum team&#x27;s representative on the Scrum of Scrums and thus playing a larger role in the coordination of the overall work of the project is one way for a technical contributor on a Scrum team to move into a role with 
broader scope and exposure.<p>2. Here, the claim is &quot;It&#x27;s aggressively short-term, by design&quot; and &quot;if you carry this way of working on for months or years, you get a lot of technical debt and you get low morale.&quot;<p>It is certainly the case that Scrum, specifically, largely addresses tactical-level, short-term processes. This is because Scrum <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a full-stack methodology, its a narrow set of practices designed to adopted as part of a larger set in an organization working in an Agile manner, and to be relatively neutral to the other practices. Certainly, if you apply Scrum <i>alone</i> with no higher-level strategic processes that set standards that constrain the definitions of &quot;done&quot; for work done in sprints to avoid technical debt, there is a lot of potential for an organization applying <i>only</i> what is in the Scrum guide to lack long-term focus and development technical debt.<p>3. The claim here is &quot;It has no regard for the programmers&#x27; career needs or desires.&quot;<p><i>Agile</i>, as a set of principles, certainly does; Scrum, as a particular set of practices, does not, for much the same reason addressed in the previous point. Largely, though, this seems to be a restatement or alleged further consequence of the first complaint about lack of a way to move up (it essentially seems to be, &quot;because of #1, Scrum leaves me nothing interesting to put on my resume&quot;), and so the response to the first complaint above largely addresses it.<p>4. There&#x27;s a lot here that deserves separate responses, so I&#x27;m going to break this one up.<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s micromanagement.&quot;<p>No, Scrum is the <i>opposite</i> of micromanagement, since the &quot;management&quot; is done almost entirely by the team.<p>> &quot;User stories and backlog grooming are there to control what the engineer works on.&quot;<p>Sure, those things exist to define work, but they are done by the team, so can hardly be viewed as micromanagement of the team.<p>> &quot;The absurdly frequent meetings (and so many different kinds of status meetings!) are to intimidate him into not slacking.&quot;<p>Scrum defines four kinds of meetings: the Sprint Planning meeting, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Retrospective, and the Sprint Review. Of them, the Sprint Review is the closest thing to a &quot;status meeting&quot;, though even their the focus is demonstrating the concrete deliverables for the Sprint rather than status reporting. All of the rest are primarily <i>action/planning</i> meetings. &quot;Status&quot; of a sort plays a role in those meetings as an input to the planning aspect, but if they become status-focused meetings rather than planning-focused, you&#x27;ve definitely lost the defined purpose of the meetings in the Scrum guide.<p>> &quot;The story points are there to track productivity (in some superficial, inaccurate way).&quot;<p>Story points (in methodologies where they are used; they aren&#x27;t part of Scrum) exist as a planning tool for the team, not a productivity measure.<p>5. The claim here is &quot;At identifying low performers, it has an unacceptably high false-positive rate.&quot;<p>Scrum (and, <i>a fortiori</i>, Agile) is not a process for identifying low performers, or for performance evaluation at all -- its completely out of scope. Its not that it is good or bad at it, it doesn&#x27;t even <i>address</i> the issue.<p>6. The claim here is &quot;It punishes R&D, and it hurts the best engineers the most&quot; because &quot;Agile and Scrum [...] single out and humiliate anyone who works for 2 weeks and doesn&#x27;t have something to show for it.&quot;<p>Research is a separate domain than product development, and there is no reason that the use of Scrum as a product development methodology should have any impact on how research is done. Of course, Scrum is a generic enough process that you <i>could</i> use it to manage research efforts as well, but the backlog items, associated definition of &quot;done&quot; for those items, sprint length, etc., would all likely be very different for a research effort than a product development effort. You could mix research items into the backlog of a team also doing product development, but then you probably have a problem defining work items that are appropriate for the product development sprint length. (This is less of a problem for non-Scrum methods that use a flow method for backlog management rather than a timeboxed Sprint cycle, because then its easier to mix items that have a longer-than-usual time involvement into the same backlog; the sprints used in Scrum place an effective upper bound on the size of work items.)<p>7. The complaint here is &quot;I have actually seen it kill companies&quot; backed by a single non-specific anecdote and the assertion that it generalizes. From the description, this appears to be a top-down all-at-once conversion to a new defined methodology. If one has processes in place, for the same reason one adopts incremental change to a software system where you&#x27;ve got an existing, functional system unless there is some reason you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do incremenetal change, the same thing should be done to a software development organization. Failure of an organization (or many organizations) to manage a big-bang change rather than incremental change doesn&#x27;t invalidate the methodology they sought to change <i>to</i> any more than failure of an organization to manage a big-bang software system replacement invalidates the technology they sought to change to.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/Scrum-Guide-US.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/Scrum-Guide-US...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.scrum.org/Blog/ArtMID/1765/ArticleID/12/Resurrecting-the-Much-Maligned-Scrum-of-Scrums"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.scrum.org/Blog/ArtMID/1765/ArticleID/12/Resurrec...</a>",1428943103

9368621,comment,9368075,9368306,0,0,throwawaymylife,,,"Squirrel is roughly similar (in the grand scheme of things) to Lua and JavaScript, with more of a (C++-style) OO flavor. Its main selling point is that it uses reference counting instead of a tracing garbage collector for automatic memory management. With a reference counted language, you pay a small but predictable cost every time something goes out of scope, whereas tracing garbage collectors coalesce all of these small costs into one big collection cycle run every few milliseconds. The tradeoff is that while garbage collected languages provide better throughput (due to cache effects, heap fragmentation, etc) for batch processing jobs, reference counted ones are much more suitable for realtime and soft realtime applications that would much rather take a constant factor hit to throughput if it eliminates the danger of a multi-millisecond GC scan causing the application to miss a deadline.<p>As such, Squirrel enjoys some popularity as (and was indeed created to serve as, by an engineer that had grown frustrated with the experience of embedding Lua in FarCry) a scripting language for video games, being most notably used in some of Valve&#x27;s newer games, like Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, and CS:GO. The rest of the engine code usually dwarves the performance impact of &quot;scripts&quot; in most games, but GC scans can still cause games embedding other scripting languages to miss a frame presentation deadline, resulting in either a nasty tear or a completely missed frame. There are ways that tracing garbage collected languages can attempt to combat this (like incremental GCs), but some engine programmers have decided to accept the throughput cost for the peace of mind that reference counting provides.<p>EDIT: I had more but HN is silently ignoring some of my edits for some reason.

  11111111 00000000 00000000

A change in the most significant bit of any of these colours would be massive. 01111111 is half as bright as 11111111.<p>But a change in the least significant bit(s) is barely noticeable. You probably wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference between 11111111 and 11111110, especially as you don&#x27;t experience individual colour channels, you see a blended colour.

  11111XXX 00000XXX 00000XXX

You now get 9 bits of data per pixel. Or less (for a less noisy image) or more (for a more noisy image). For a 640x480 image, you now have 345.6KB of data.

If I work from home, or use my free time in office for working out/ my own learning, they get frustrated.

Dumping the whole season at once doesn&#x27;t allow any communal discussion or suspense, dragging it out over 2 months is meant more to drive revenue for the distributors than the enjoyment of the viewing public. I think releasing 3 episodes a week is probably the optimal strategy; it gives the show&#x27;s communities time to confer and it keeps a reasonable pace without placing what some apparently feel is a demand to watch all 13 episodes in one sitting. It mitigates spoiler paranoia that you get with Netflix shows (which only further diminishes the communal aspects) and does other good things. I think it&#x27;s all around the best strategy for the consumer. I understand Netflix uses binge releases as one of its selling points, but maybe now that they&#x27;ve established a respectable pedigree, they can stage some of their releases in iterations moving forward.",1428940836

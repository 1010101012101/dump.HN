Two weeks ago I got into the fbFund incubator program, and the first thing they asked me to do is to convert to a C-Corp. I'm glad I started with an S-Corp because converting to C is a simple form I can do myself. It's also doable with LLC, but it's a lot more paperwork.",1244303858

I have replaced Google with Bing as the default search provider in the browsers on my machines.  So the central idea of the article may have merit.<p>Just an idea . . . perhaps we could take an HN poll on the question of how many HNers have switched their browser search provider to Bing.",1244303759

644835,comment,644818,644818,0,0,pwim,,,"This survey is producing pretty meaningless results.  55% will replace Google with Bing, but at the same time 55% say it wasn't different enough from Google.  Furthermore, how do you plan to replace a search engine?  Either you do it or you don't.  This survey seems poorly conducted, and I think there is little point in conducting a survey about this in the first place, as the traffic generated by Bing vs. Google can be relatively easily measured.",1244302932

It's amazing the disparity between using and coding.<p>Experience plays a great role in implementing, while a lot of times it is the one that sets the boundaries to imagination. This makes young minds very viable to imagination, but surely need the experience to go further. Aleveo should connect them, and give feedback on those ideas, by enriching them with others' experiences.<p>Only then can we judge if these students have viable ideas. So, soon we'll find out :)<p>Thanks for the comment!",1244300602

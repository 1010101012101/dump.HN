How very convenient, to teach Ivy League graduates that Ancient Greece can be generalized but modern Switzerland or Iceland (or many U.S. States) are isolated, culturally unique, examples. :-)<p>I haven&#x27;t read a very good analysis of California yet. What I read about it looks like they got into the trouble because they have both representative and direct systems kind of checkmating each other. Would they prefer strictly one system over another, it wouldn&#x27;t have happened.<p>There are couple of other U.S. States with similar provisions for semi-direct democracy (which is actually a model I prefer, like in Switzerland), and they don&#x27;t seem to have quite the same problems as California.",1376222389

Or a plugin. Or a
  library. It&#x27;s hard to tell because it has a core library written in C++
  and a Python module to allow video scripts to be created.  It came to be
  when I started thinking about alternative designs for Avisynth and most
  of it was written over a 3 month period.  The software has been heavily
  inspired by Avisynth and aims to be a 21st century rewrite, taking
  advantage of the advancements computers have made since the late 90s.
  The main features compared to Avisynth are:
  
   * Multithreaded - Frame level multithreading that scales well
   * Generalized Colorspaces - New Colorspaces can be specified at runtime
   * Per Frame Properties - Additional metadata can be attached to frames
   * Python Based - The scripting part is implemented as a Python module
     so you don&#x27;t have to learn a special language
   * Support for video with format changes - Some video just can&#x27;t stick
     to one format or frame size. VapourSynth can handle any kind of
     change
   * Compatible with a large number of already existing Avisynth plugins

The samples in this study come from a mix of uncontrolled wild populations living in contact with humans and from captive populations who were not subject to a long term control.<p>In science you don&#x27;t get to declare any old thing you like and then everyone else has to immediately agree to test it. Everyone else is free to propose other hypotheses that fit the facts and it is generally accepted that the simplest hypothesis consistent with the evidence is more likely to be correct.<p>The concept of a viral or epigenetic effect on either the efficiency of digestion or the efficiency of metabolism is worth investigating. However it would require a complicated mechanism to explain how and why it happened simultaneously across a mix of populations. Another explanation, given that all these populations are in contact with the human food supply, is that the human food supply has changed to be more calorifically dense. And, of course, it may be some combination of the above.<p>A simple way to examine the mystery would be to look at animal populations in other countries.

When I win, the end result is correct more often in Haskell than in any other language I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>And now we get to a few of questions related to bias:<p>* Given that debugging is difficult in Haskell, do Haskell programmers to get in the habit of statically debugging their code? Is that really more &quot;better&quot; than dynamic debugging? Some type error messages in languages like Scala and Haskell can make static debugging quite painful.<p>* Does Haskell&#x27;s powerful type system bias it to well understood problems with meaningful types? I attended a WGFP meeting once, and it was amazing to hear people like SPJ talk about how they found elegant solutions to icky programming problems, but I thought that, given a dirtier language, you could just write a dirty solution and be done with it.<p>* Would Python&#x27;s dynamic type system make it more suited to problems with dirtier less clear types when compared to Haskell?

I.e. assuming you consume a constant amount of the stuff (let&#x27;s say two cups of coffee a day), once your brain has adapted to this  intake, is there any advantage in the habit compared to me never drinking any? Or does it effectively make your now adapted mind work just like if you had never consumed any caffeine at all?<p>I&#x27;ve gone clean a few times now, and the effects and time-frame given in the article seem head-on. I have a feeling that I function no worse without any caffeine than when i was drinking regular doses, except my mental performance is more even throughout the day (no spikes after a cup of latte and no tiredness in the evening after I stop drinking). Also, I sleep a lot better.<p>Additionally, being completely off caffeine gives me a powerful tool strictly for emergency use - if I really need to drive all night without falling asleep at the wheel or push out a new release before going away for a week, one cup of coffee works like magic. I do reserve it for really important cases only, and made it a rule to not drink any for at least two weeks after that to clear up again.",1376219947

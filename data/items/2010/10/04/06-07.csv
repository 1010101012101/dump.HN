And, I'm really looking forward to adding on recommender systems and use some machine learning with the scads of data we're collecting.<p><i>AI research and related topics and startups rarely make news. Is it really such a dead field? There's never any breakthroughs announced, and there's no grandiose research projects underway that I know of.</i><p>AI companies are all over the place.

MICROSOFT WANTS TO BE IN THE CONSUMER MARKET.

They are going to compete with the likes of Dell on merit of quality. This ""signature team"" is the team responsible for setting that quality bar.<p>In true Microsoft fashion, ""Windows Signature"" is an internal name that is leaking externally. In this case, it appears to be intentionally. It seems like an odd choice because no one talks about ""Windows Dell"", why should Microsoft have a name for this? It's just plain silly, but I digress.<p>Since Microsoft doesn't need to pay for Windows licenses, they will have higher margins and will be able to muscle around the OEMs who depend on crapware for profits.

The teens create jaw-dropping audiovisual effects beyond the dreams of most multimedia designers. Constantly striving to better their rivals, devotees of the demo scene cram spectacular three- or four-minute presentations onto a single 800-Kbyte floppy disk, fitting them into tiny amounts of memory. Freely spread by disk-swapping over bulletin boards and other sites on the Internet, then replayed on home computers all over the planet, each demo becomes a piece of digital graffiti, proclaiming the superiority of the gang that created it.

The reason why this concerned me was that some of the information they need to collect included things like bank account numbers - so having this information sent insecurely to the Ombudsman was (imho) a big no-no.<p>I guess I finally managed to get through to someone who can fix it after I sent emails directly to the chief Financial Ombudsmen explaining exactly why it was an issue, with screenshots showing exactly where the problems were (I highlighted the appropriate parts) and an example explaining exactly how someone could use this information to engineer someone's account passwords out of them easily.<p>Thankfully its all fixed now.",1286172953

When you buy any PC with crapware on it at $discounter, you can go to that Microsoft store, <i>buy another, possibly non-upgrade, license of Windows</i> and they install that?<p>So in turn, MS gets to sell two licenses (the oem and the end-user one), the crapware vendor gets paid for installing the crapware and the consumer gets a clean windows installation for more than twice the price. Awesome deal. Yes.<p>I know why I stopped using Windows machines<p>Edit: also, it's debatable whether Acrobat Reader doesn't also qualify as crapware, when you consider it's recent security history and the fact that there are alternatives around (which, unfortunately, isn't true for flash player)",1286172606

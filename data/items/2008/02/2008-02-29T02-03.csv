People that would use this would probably just use adBlock, no?",1204252797

It is the wrong paradigm for value creation these days because most hardware startups require large capital expenditures upfront.<p>EE training also forces you into a mode of thought that focuses on concrete implementation rather than making what people want.<p>Turing taught us that any machine implemented in digital logic can be implemented with a basic microprocessor.  Knowledge of transistor transfer functions and Nyquist plots are useless in a startup context these days.<p>Comp Sci or bust.",1204252374

I sense potential twitter partnerships!<p>Yeah, I am in grad school in Shanghai, everybody gets a mobile phone here, but I wonder if SMS is too cumbersome for  dream input, after all it's a long text to type with the tiny keyboard.<p>>If you want to talk about this anymore, I hang out in #startups on irc.freenode.net a lot.

We're using Portable Allegro serve even though it's not as full featured as we'd like.  A full featured (but slower) webserver is Huchentoot - which would probably be an excellent choice for starting out.  You could then learn lisp by creating a web app - the inductive approach.  Also extremely helpful is lispdoc.com where you can run a search on anything lisp and get references to numerous web resources.",1204251595

125832,comment,125369,125369,0,0,makecheck,,,"In files that ignore unknown or unused definitions (like CSS and HTML), my preference is just to misspell keywords and identifiers by adding an ""x"" prefix.<p>For example, if you have a block:
    .mystyle {
        font-size: smaller;
        . . . 
    }<p>You can virtually comment-out the whole thing with one extra character:
    .xmystyle {
        font-size: smaller;
        . . . 
    }<p>This also works to kill just one property:
    .mystyle {
        xfont-size: smaller;
        . . . 
    }<p>It applies to HTML attributes too, e.g. <mytag class=""abc""> could be disabled with <mytag class=""xabc"">, which is much simpler than any hack to comment-out the HTML tags or delete the class attribute.",1204251203

So I mimicked the interface, it's clean and straight.<p>>Why shouldn't I just write down my dreams or post them on my blog?<p>Had this question in my mind from the day 1. I am working on a dictionary like database, the only difference being the explanation would be interpretation. Then it should work like this, for every word when there is a match in the database, the word become a tag and the word/interpretation pair is displayed below the dream text. The only difficulty is building such a database.<p>>Being able to reply to individual dreams might be annoying, though maybe we could post ""interpretations""<p>I agree, interpretations make more sense than comments here.",1204250798

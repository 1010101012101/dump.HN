7742540,comment,7741564,7742299,7,0,Jach,,,"While you shouldn&#x27;t need to at lower difficulties or on easier campaigns, you can always quick save before a move or at the end of your turn and reload if you didn&#x27;t like the result of your move or the enemy moves. Do it a lot in the early scenarios to build up hero unit reserves and see if you can make it through later scenarios without reloading. Mark the turn start save and try a strategy, if it fails go back to that turn instead of starting over. And note that if your strategy is poor, continually reloading alone won&#x27;t let you win. (Unless maybe you spend a crap ton of time waiting for positive outcomes of minuscule-probability events...)<p>Edit: I remembered a quote I liked from early on in Iain Banks&#x27; <i>The Player of Games</i>. While I still like chess (and take issue with the notion that reality is built on chance, rather than our predictive measurements of reality restricted to chance due to us being part of reality not outside it) I thought this was a pretty great put-down of games without chance at all:<p><i>&quot;All reality is a game. Physics at its most fundamental, the very fabric of our universe, results directly from the interaction of certain fairly simple rules, and chance; the same description may be applied to the best, most elegant and both intellectually and aesthetically satisfying games. By being unknowable, by resulting from events which, at the sub-atomic level, cannot be fully predicted, the future remains make-able, and retains the possibility of change, the hope of coming to prevail; victory, to use an unfashionable word. In this, the future is a game; time is one of the rules. Generally, all the best mechanistic games - those which can be played in any sense &quot;perfectly&quot;, such as a grid, Prallian scope, &#x27;nkraytle, chess, Farnic dimensions - can be traced to civilisations lacking a realistic view of the universe (let alone the reality). They are also, I might add, invariably pre-machine-sentience societies.<p>&quot;The very first-rank games acknowledge the element of chance, even if they rightly restrict raw luck. To attempt to construct a game on any other lines, no matter how complicated and subtle the rules are, and regardless of the scale and differentiation of the playing volume and the variety of the powers and attibutes of the pieces, is inevitably to schackle oneself to a conspectus which is not merely socially but techno-philosophically lagging several ages behind our own. As a historical exercise it might have some value. As a work of the intellect, it&#x27;s just a waste of time. If you want to make something old-fashioned, why not build a wooden sailing boat, or a steam engine? They&#x27;re just as complicated and demanding as a mechanistic game, and you&#x27;ll keep fit at the same time.&quot;</i>",1400050547

7742518,comment,7738768,7739436,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"You don&#x27;t understand my point. If you look at human psychology, things connected to power are often fascinating, but not always in the &quot;I&#x27;m going to get the other guy and beat the shit of him&quot; way. Young boys are fascinated with toy helicopters, trucks, army soldiers, and yes, spaceships, but they aren&#x27;t being evil/scheming about it. For them, it&#x27;s just a game. There are two levels of fascination with power: a) the childish &quot;ooh that&#x27;s cool&quot; and b) the adult &quot;hmm, we would be a pretty powerful nation/team/individuals if we got hold of it&quot;.<p>But the underlying reason why something is fascinating -- because it is connected with power -- doesn&#x27;t change. So it is hypocritical to claim that &quot;I want this and that, and my intention are innocent and sincere&quot; when the object of your desire is a helicopter gunship. Now, something flying at 7.8 km per second is potentially far more dangerous than a helicopter gunship.<p>In other words, wanting space exploration to be free of politics is essentially wanting power to be free of politics.

Was just talking to a co-worker the other day about how static types are sometimes, and they were saying how any sufficiently large code base written by average developers will have more and more things like that (void*) casts and so on. So then type safety kind of goes out of the window.<p>For languages like Go you look at static types from 2 sides - 1) it is there for safety and reliability (so in this case if it couldn&#x27;t be circumvented it would that way) or 2) it is there to speed things up. Then Go is like a faster Python but casting things left and right erasing types will make the code blow up.<p>So taking the second approach, I don&#x27;t see it as terribly.

But let me try to answer your question.<p>The internet genres that go for clever but shallow wit and/or maximum emotional rev-up don&#x27;t fit well here. The pleasures of surprise, recognition, and indignation that they evoke run at different frequencies than the intellectual curiosity that HN tries to nurture. The latter needs material which is more reflective and longer-lasting. As PG wrote somewhere, the thought processes are quieter and slower. Snap reactions thwart them.<p>It&#x27;s not that those other genres suck—they&#x27;re often delightfully clever. But their influence takes HN away from its core. Experience has shown that such high-frequency, low-amplitude stuff drowns everything else out if allowed to, so we don&#x27;t have the luxury of allowing everything equally. For HN to thrive, we have to clear a space for more substantive material. That&#x27;s hard and constantly being encroached on. But one fairly easy win is to rule out sites that play the other game.

It only excludes extreme targets.<p>The two rules that you really can bank on are that calorie intake is directly linked to weight loss/gain, and you need a certain amount of protein and fat to maintain or build muscle. That being said, protein needed for survival is minimal. Other dietary parameters will affect long-term health, but laypersons are so inundated with misinformation that it&#x27;s better to eat a variety of foods in moderation than to adopt extreme diets or novel nutritional theories.<p>Why are those &quot;one weird trick&quot; ads so profitable?<p>I have a hypothesis that people focus on magic pills (like fish oil) and conspiracy theories (like sugar toxicity) because it is a welcome distraction from an ugly truth: that in order to achieve their ideal body composition, they just need to be extremely disciplined and hardworking in their dietary and exercise habits, and for the sake of long-term health, they should lay off the junk food. There&#x27;s no &quot;trick&quot;. People already generally know what they have to do, but they pretend to themselves that they don&#x27;t, because if they know what they have to do and fail to do it, that&#x27;s indicative of personal weakness. It&#x27;s cognitive dissonance.",1400047407

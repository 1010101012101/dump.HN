You have the exact same problems with CPAN and everyone and even the most devoted perl-haters will admit ""perl is a terrible language, but CPAN is amazing"".  You run into the exact same problems with every other language, the only difference being dynamic languages tend to be lazy about correctly managing version numbers, so you get ""installs properly but completely breaks my app"" instead of ""tells you it can't install because of a version conflict"".<p>>I was in #haskell on IRC not too long ago and they couldn't even figure out why a haskell-platform install couldn't upgrade its own cabal with no other packages installed.<p>Well obviously, since it does in fact work just fine, it is quite difficult to figure out what weirdness that individual did to create his problem.",1358877586

It is my strong belief that the SEC needs to consider investment crowdfunding for non-accredited investors as an urgent matter and finalize the JOBS Act regulations immediately. The delays in these regulations will also delay the creation of thousands of new jobs in the United States, not to mention the fate of this growing pool of fundless startups.</i><p>A couple weeks ago, we saw an HNer proposition to give $8K for a 50/50 ""co-founder"" seed funding-type split:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5037694"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5037694</a><p>There is absolutely no reason, aside from the existing regulations / barriers to entry, that this model shouldn't be applied to helping new enterprises get seed funding.  The $8K / 50:50 made a great initial throwdown offer. . . but in a market setting, there should be competition; what if someone else more generous could offered $10K without requiring half the equity?  One necessary element is a bidding platform, and a place for people with cash to transact with people who have ideas.   More potential investors equal higher potential investments equal more opportunity for those ""fundless startups"" to get up and running.<p>It would be awesome to work on something like this (ping me -- I'd love to get back to work!):  build an eBay clone, integrate Stripe to handle escrow/payments and collect a ridiculously small fraction of the economic surplus created.  No need to be greedy (as per the current flaw of existing systems); this model would make investing accessible to common folks and be profitable enough as a going-concern.",1358877468

In addition, even if it would happen you have more than plenty of time to reverse the transaction at your bank (which shouldn't involve any discussion or so with the bank).<p>As for transactions themselves, unlike in the US where you can conduct ACH transactions in both directions (i.e., debiting another account) IBAN transactions are ""sending only"" (like email).

5098406,comment,5098218,5098241,14,0,bonzoesc,,,"<i>fixed formatting, broke into paragraphs</i><p>I used to think I was a pretty good person. I certainly didnt kill people, for example. But then Peter Singer pointed out that animals were conscious and that eating them led them to be killed and that wasnt all that morally different from killing people after all. So I became a vegetarian. Again I thought I was a pretty good person. But then Arianna Huffington told me that by driving in a car I was pouring toxic fumes into the air and sending money to foreign dictatorships. So I got a bike instead. But then I realized that my bike seat was sewn by children in foreign sweatshops while its tubing was made by mining metals through ripping up the earth. Indeed, any money I spent was likely to go to oppressing people or destroying the planet in one way or another. And if I happen to make money some of it goes to the government which spends it blowing people up in Afghanistan or Iraq.<p>I thought about just living off of stuff I found in dumpsters, like some friends. That way I wouldnt be responsible for encouraging its production. But then I realized that some people buy the things they cant find in dumpsters; if I got to the dumpster and took something before they did, they might buy it instead. The solution seemed clear: Id have to go off-the-grid and live in a cave, gathering nuts and berries. Id still probably be exhaling CO2 and using some of the products in the Earth, but probably only in levels that were sustainable.<p>Perhaps you disagree with me that its morally wrong to kill animals or blow up people in Afghanistan. But surely you can imagine that it might be, or at least that someone could think it is. And I think its similarly clear that eating a hamburger or paying taxes contributes  in a very small way; perhaps only has the possibility of contributing  to those things. Even if you dont, everyday life has a million ways that are more direct. Personally, I think its wrong that I get to sit at a table and gaily devour while someone else delivers more food to my table and a third person slaves over a stove. Every time I order food, I make them do more carrying and slaving. (Perhaps they get some money in return, but surely theyd prefer it if I just gave them the money.) Again, you may not think this wrong but I hope you can admit the possibility. And its obviously my fault.<p>Off in the cave, I thought I was safe. But then I read Peter Singers latest book. He points out that for as little as a quarter, you can save a childs life. (E.g. for 27 cents you can buy the oral rehydration salts that will save a child from fatal diarrhea.) Perhaps I was killing people after all. I couldnt morally make money, for the reasons described above. (Although maybe its worth helping fund the bombing of children in Afghanistan in order to help save children in Mozambique.) But instead of living in a cave, I could go to Africa and volunteer my time. Of course, if I do that there are a thousand other things Im not doing. How can I decide which action I take will save the most lives? Even if I take the time to figuring out, thats time Im spending on myself instead of saving lives.<p>It seems impossible to be moral. Not only does everything I do cause great harm, but so does everything I dont do. Standard accounts of morality assume that its difficult, but attainable: dont lie, dont cheat, dont steal. But it seems like living a moral life isnt even possible. But if morality is unattainable, surely I should simply do the best I can. (Ought implies can, after all.) Peter Singer is a good utilitarian, so perhaps I should try to maximize the good I do for the world. But even this seems like an incredibly onerous standard. I should not just stop eating meat, but animal products altogether. I shouldnt just stop buying factory-farmed food, I should stop buying altogether. I should take things out of dumpsters other people are unlikely to be searching. I should live someplace where others wont be disturbed. Of course all this worrying and stress is preventing me from doing any good in the world.<p>I can hardly take a step without thinking about who it hurts. So I decide not to worry about the bad I might be doing and just focus on doing good  screw the rules. But this doesnt just apply to the rules inspired by Peter Singer. Waiting in line at the checkout counter is keeping me from my life-saving work (and paying will cost me life-saving money)  better just to shoplift. Lying, cheating, any crime can be similarly justified.<p>It seems paradoxical: in my quest to do good Ive justified doing all sorts of bad. Nobody questioned me when I went out and ordered a juicy steak, but when I shoplift soda everyone recoils. Is there sense in following their rules or are they just another example of the worlds pervasive immorality?

[video]",http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdt6Jj64TVU,"Why is it that organized interest groups such as the National Rifle Association wield such powerful influence in policy discussions? According to Professor Mike Munger, the reason is simple. In politics, small but organized groups win.<p>Politics is sometimes more complicated than simply having the majority of voters on your side. Prof. Munger explains the three main factors that can allow a smaller interest group to succeed in implementing a policy that may be opposed by a larger (but unorganized) group. First, an interest group's members receive individual benefits from the group's success, which encourages them to act. Second, smaller groups will find it easier overcome the ""Free-Rider Problem"" since each member's contribution is more visible. Finally, interest groups frequently offer selective incentives that reward people who help support their cause.<p>This economic concept applies to issues far beyond gun rights. Interest groups ranging from environmental activists to rent-seeking corporate lobbyists all understand that Prof. Munger is correct when he says, ""Politics in Washington is about concentrating and focusing power.""",1358876389

Really? I would love to see such a group in action. I <i>imagine</i> they must exist, but I also strongly believe people hear the myths of such teams much more than they actually have experienced such a thing themselves.<p>Meanwhile, I'm going to head back to figuring out to get a QA member to stop being so toxic to our overall efforts, make sure a developer properly knows the expectations on how to interact with the rest of the team, sort out the next 3-6 months of priorities with the executive team accounting for all internal department requests and our lengthy product roadmap, help a lead dev resolve an issue with a really smart developer who has taken twice as long as expected on a straightforward task, find time to look through a whole bunch of resumes that are likely nowhere near where what we're seeking in candidates, and then make sure all the right people receive updates to all of those activities. We'll see what tomorrow brings.<p>To be clear, I absolutely love my job. It's extremely rewarding to see even one of those items get checked of the list in a given day, or the not-always-well-communicated but good-intentioned appreciation that a single member of my team sends my way after helping him remove an obstacle or provide some sort of useful feedback. It's definitely a much different type of challenge from when I was a full-time dev, but I honestly get at least as much out of the experience as I did solving problems with code.<p>I can't point people at a team of 100 developers that operate like a herd of unicorns, negating their 1 bumbling manager.

The ending was right, after seventeen years of it bouncing around my head. Soon after I did a few experiments at getting the rough, painterly look it's always had in my head in my artistic weapon of choice, Adobe Illustrator, and nailed it. My sketches looked pretty much exactly what I couldn't actually produce all those years ago.<p>This November, I made significant progress on the first draft of a full script for the whole thing.

5098241,comment,5098218,5098218,8,0,Skywing,,,"The defacing message is pretty deep, too. This is copied from the website, and is not my own. I'm just pasting it so that it's readable here, too:<p><pre><code>  I used to think I was a pretty good person. I certainly didnt kill people, for example. But then Peter Singer pointed out that animals were conscious and that eating them led them to be killed and that wasnt all that morally different from killing people after all. So I became a vegetarian. Again I thought I was a pretty good person. But then Arianna Huffington told me that by driving in a car I was pouring toxic fumes into the air and sending money to foreign dictatorships. So I got a bike instead. But then I realized that my bike seat was sewn by children in foreign sweatshops while its tubing was made by mining metals through ripping up the earth. Indeed, any money I spent was likely to go to oppressing people or destroying the planet in one way or another. And if I happen to make money some of it goes to the government which spends it blowing people up in Afghanistan or Iraq. I thought about just living off of stuff I found in dumpsters, like some friends. That way I wouldnt be responsible for encouraging its production. But then I realized that some people buy the things they cant find in dumpsters; if I got to the dumpster and took something before they did, they might buy it instead. The solution seemed clear: Id have to go off-the-grid and live in a cave, gathering nuts and berries. Id still probably be exhaling CO2 and using some of the products in the Earth, but probably only in levels that were sustainable. Perhaps you disagree with me that its morally wrong to kill animals or blow up people in Afghanistan. But surely you can imagine that it might be, or at least that someone could think it is. And I think its similarly clear that eating a hamburger or paying taxes contributes  in a very small way; perhaps only has the possibility of contributing  to those things. Even if you dont, everyday life has a million ways that are more direct. Personally, I think its wrong that I get to sit at a table and gaily devour while someone else delivers more food to my table and a third person slaves over a stove. Every time I order food, I make them do more carrying and slaving. (Perhaps they get some money in return, but surely theyd prefer it if I just gave them the money.) Again, you may not think this wrong but I hope you can admit the possibility. And its obviously my fault. Off in the cave, I thought I was safe. But then I read Peter Singers latest book. He points out that for as little as a quarter, you can save a childs life. (E.g. for 27 cents you can buy the oral rehydration salts that will save a child from fatal diarrhea.) Perhaps I was killing people after all. I couldnt morally make money, for the reasons described above. (Although maybe its worth helping fund the bombing of children in Afghanistan in order to help save children in Mozambique.) But instead of living in a cave, I could go to Africa and volunteer my time. Of course, if I do that there are a thousand other things Im not doing. How can I decide which action I take will save the most lives? Even if I take the time to figuring out, thats time Im spending on myself instead of saving lives. It seems impossible to be moral. Not only does everything I do cause great harm, but so does everything I dont do. Standard accounts of morality assume that its difficult, but attainable: dont lie, dont cheat, dont steal. But it seems like living a moral life isnt even possible. But if morality is unattainable, surely I should simply do the best I can. (Ought implies can, after all.) Peter Singer is a good utilitarian, so perhaps I should try to maximize the good I do for the world. But even this seems like an incredibly onerous standard. I should not just stop eating meat, but animal products altogether. I shouldnt just stop buying factory-farmed food, I should stop buying altogether. I should take things out of dumpsters other people are unlikely to be searching. I should live someplace where others wont be disturbed. Of course all this worrying and stress is preventing me from doing any good in the world. I can hardly take a step without thinking about who it hurts. So I decide not to worry about the bad I might be doing and just focus on doing good  screw the rules. But this doesnt just apply to the rules inspired by Peter Singer. Waiting in line at the checkout counter is keeping me from my life-saving work (and paying will cost me life-saving money)  better just to shoplift. Lying, cheating, any crime can be similarly justified. It seems paradoxical: in my quest to do good Ive justified doing all sorts of bad. Nobody questioned me when I went out and ordered a juicy steak, but when I shoplift soda everyone recoils. Is there sense in following their rules or are they just another example of the worlds pervasive immorality? Have any philosophers considered this question?

This had been kicking around in my brain for a long time, re-emerging every time I learned or read about a new programming language whose syntax seemed unnecessarily complex or conventional. As overwhelming as new language development is, I decided to set a goal for the end of 2012: a sufficiently complete proof-of-concept implementation, with documentation, to demonstrate the basic concepts. The result:<a href=""http://om-language.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://om-language.org</a><p>Although the language itself isn't useful for anything yet, the side benefits of developing it have been many:<p>- Developing my C++, Doxygen, and Unicode knowledge/skills to a high-advanced level, which I have applied in my professional software career.<p>- Filling in lots of gaps in my knowledge of concatenative (and other) language theory.<p>- Discovering that using prefix notation in a concatenative language works better than postfix: no stack underflows, no data stack needed, and a program effectively becomes a partially-applied function awaiting more data (i.e. the rest of the program), elegantly allowing for data pipelining and events. As far as I know, using prefix notation in a concatenative language is a first.<p>- Discovering ""panmorphic types"": that when every piece of data can be expressed completely and equivalently in a uniform way (in this case, as a quoted program), data types become an implementation detail.<p>- Rethinking how to best define ""number"" with respect to a computation, which has led me to arbitrary-precision arithmetic implementations, Riemann spheres, APL, and down all kinds of other interesting rabbit holes -- resulting in some new number theory ideas which I am fleshing out for incorporation into the language.<p>- Learning all the glue technologies to actually release it (CMake, GitHub, etc.).<p>- Writing documentation that describes it to others.  This has clarified my thinking on it more than anything.<p>Most importantly: I've invented a real language! It feels good.<p>Although I'll be adding to this project forever, none of these benefits would have happened if I didn't set some goals for getting it out of my brain and starting to flesh it out.

If you travel by bike and public transport, the places that are easiest to get to are geographically close or with large population densities (= good public transport). 
You never do ""take away"" or go to a drive in. At the tiny local hamburger joint between your workplace and home, you might see some people that you might otherwise avoid (you then realize why the drive in was invented) - and you reflect about your difference and are happy that you have a steady job. Or you can hang out with a laptop in a cafe in the city center, bump into an old friend and go somewhere together.<p>With a car, you're insulated from all that. You drive alone, you order your hamburgers from the drive in and go home and eat it alone. You avoid city centers since there's too much traffic there. You try to get your errands and hobbies done in industrial areas and suburbs by the outer ring roads circling the city. Your car whisks you there effortlessly, covering tens of kilometers in a few minutes.  You live in a totally different world.<p>After a while you notice you haven't seen another person besides family and colleagues up close for a week. Your physical condition gets worse as well.
On the other hand, you might get into deep personal talks with your friends while giving them a lift in the night. You don't drink anymore. In theory, you could start a hobby that requires traveling to hard to get places with large equipment, but that might just as well be a fantasy that justifies the convenience of owning a car.<p>It's a striking contrast in life style. I wish the best sides from both could somehow easily be combined.<p>(If I didn't live in a North European city, I could bicycle much more. California weather could be ideal for something like that, if only city planning supported it.)<p>Nobody ever told me that this happens when you get a car?",1358874538

In terms of accessibility, planned suburban towns are far ahead of older cities that have never been designed with accessibility in mind.

But neither Sun nor Oracle seem to have figured out a way to distribute Java for free to the world at large and make a profit off of it, and it's hard to imagine that Microsoft is any more capable of pulling that rabbit out of its hat.<p>Perhaps the trick is that you don't try to make money on it, at least not directly.  And there's a great project out there that's trying to do it that way.  But, well. . . . ugh.  I love Mono; it seems like it has everything going for it.  From a technical standpoint it's been rapidly closing the gap with Microsoft's implementation, which I suspect means it's probably already ahead of the Java platform in many respects.  The flagship language is certainly way ahead.  And it has the singular distinction of being the only Free platform in this sector, which would make you think that folks would be extremely interested in seeing it win.  Why that doesn't seem to be the case continues to mystify me.  I know it's still got a few Big Business cooties on it, but it's got way, way, way less of them than Java does.",1358874012

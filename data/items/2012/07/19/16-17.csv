4266936,comment,4266115,4266886,3,0,Dove,,,"Their discussion of that attack, from the paper itself:<p><pre><code>    If the attacker is allowed multiple authentication \n    attempts  iterating the extraction and test phases, \n    alternating between the two  then the protocol may \n    become insecure.  The reason is that during an \n    authentication attempt the attacker sees the three \n    sequences k0; k1; k2 and could memorize one of them (30 \n    symbols). He would then train ofine on that sequence so \n    that at the next authentication attempt he would have a \n    1/3 chance in succeeding. If the attacker could memorize \n    all three sequences (90 symbols), he could ofine \n    subject a trained user to all three sequences and \n    reliably determine which is the correct one and then \n    train himself on that sequence. He is then guaranteed \n    success at the next authentication trial.\n\n    We note that this attack is non-trivial to pull off \n    since it can be difcult for a human attacker to \n    memorize an entire sequence at the speed the game is \n    played.\n</code></pre>\n. . . which isn't all that reassuring, given that if I were trying to break in using this technique, I wouldn't be <i>memorizing</i>, I'd be <i>recording</i>.<p>But it sounds like the system is designed to only give an attacker one trial (notionally opening a trap door under his feet if he fails even once), and it does seem much more secure in that context.",1342717171

4266918,comment,4264398,4265892,2,0,pasbesoin,,,"The problem is that a lot of people spouting ""free market"" demagoguery  don't practice your definition.  Rather, it is indeed ""anything and everything they can get away with"".<p>There is also strong correlation with people intent on telling <i>other people</i> how to live <i>their lives</i>.  (Even and all the more so when this ends up through revelations and evidence being a ""do as I say, not as I do"" type of message.)<p>One of my problems with so-called ""free marketeers"", is that so many of them are outright hypocrites.<p>Sigh.  Trending too far towards the political, here on HN.  But people, including many technical people, need to look at, analyze, and take apart free market arguments and statements, to see what parts are true and/or work and what parts don't.<p>I myself favor broadly but fairly strictly defining spaces and rules within which private enterprise can compete relatively freely.  But, private enterprise does not become the final arbiter of same.<p>That's what studies I recall seem to have indicated.  Regulation works well in broad strokes.  It falls down in micro-management.  But you paint those strokes strongly, and you don't let the competitors step an inch over that line without consequences.  (Even if, sometimes, the consequences are a re-evaluation and adjustment of the regulation.  Sometimes, the times really do change.)<p>If you let private enterprise loose entirely, you end up enabling the eventual establishment of quasi-states -- perhaps to eventually become de facto or real states.  Autocratic states, by the nature of their structure.<p>I'm not sure we really want, or are willing to concede to the inevitability of, a Gibsonian near-future.  Yet.<p>As for the regulation.  It should all be open.  With the world an ever shrinking place, private actions simply are no longer isolated.  When company X pollutes watershed Y, it's no longer just a matter of their bottom line.  Even in resulting settlements, court procedures, and arbitration, non-disclosure should not be a legal option for them.  Shine the light of day on these bad actors.  And shine it on government failures that enabled them.<p>A bit idealistic.  But, IMO, better than ""all hail free markets"".<p>P.S.  If you think markets are free, try following jobs across national boundaries.  There is no worldwide ""free market"" in labor.  (Something a bit less obvious to the highly skilled than to the rest of the world labor force.)",1342716938

I believe the point of the goofy ""league"" and cat are to bring in sites, which are mostly made up of reddit'ors and weird-ass-looking-cat lovers. Once the sites are onboard and the ""league"" sends out the ""signal"", this site has to attract the users, who are the redditors and cheezburger-ites. Some small, minuscule fraction of those will do things like call their senators, resulting in tied-up phone lines, angry recriminations, and general panic.[1] That is what your old-style Senator is going to take seriously.<p>The organizational style is very similar to that of other organizations that attempt to motivate constituents like the NRA and AARP and if you really want to spend some time boggling, check out their communications to their constituency.<p>In other words, the ""general public"" is not the target here. Neither are representatives, <i>directly</i>. The target is the ""Z generation""[2], which are underrepresented in political debates, I think. And if you want <i>them</i> to do something, you probably want to use some memes.<p>[1] That's hyperbole, but I do suspect that if .01% of the American readers of icanhascheezburger were to call their representatives,<p>[2] ""Z generation""?

But online it will be at a severe disadvantage, and I'm not likely to find it at all unless I set out for it specifically.

4266721,comment,4266083,4266410,7,0,georgemcbay,,,"""has Apple really been more litigious with their patent portfolio than Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and Google""<p>There's no question that Apple has been more litigious than Google.  Google stands pretty much alone these days as one of the tech giants who hasn't been an asshole when it comes to abusing the patent system.<p>Example: Hadoop is an open source implementation of Google's MapReduce and GFS papers, both technologies are patented by Google and were huge competitive advantages for them in their main business.  Did Google go around suing people using Hadoop?  No, they granted Apache a liberal blanket patent license to make sure anyone who used Hadoop would be secure in knowing they weren't going to be sued for it.<p>Up until fairly recently Microsoft was also pretty good with patents but lately they've become schizophrenic (some groups in the company have been doing good things to calm fears of patent suits stemming from Mono, some groups have been shaking down Android licensees for patent fees).<p>IBM has a long history of patent abuse.  Oracle too (though not to the scale of IBM in their prime).",1342714969

Weren't SOPA and PIPA defeated by volunteers in ad hoc communities and not paid salarymen working for a quasi online charity? Why is this not structured as a charitable organization? Why is my donation not tax deductible? Who are the people behind this? Where are they based? Why is this so United States centric? Who is backing this financially so far? Where is the about page? Is this a scam?<p>There should be <i>a lot</i> more details on that page before you ask people for money.<p>I would have preferred that donations were directed to the EFF, and that the online organization is done by volunteers - as, you know, it has worked just fine in the past.",1342713697

Being beaten every other day is ""normal"" to them.<p>There are two problems with this ""adaption"".  It creates adults with warped sense of what's normal.  If they are lucky enough to gain a healthy disposition, they end up hating their parents for the upbringing they got.",1342713663

It's very likely that its actually ~8 SSDs md/LVM'd together as two volumes(JBOD, no raid). I'm pretty sure they've taken steps to ensure that TRIM is working, as they'd burn through drives/complaints too quickly otherwise.<p>That said, you're absolutely right about being cautious/not RAIDing the volumes. There are almost no RAID configurations that support TRIM at present, so it's definitely not a good idea to be RAIDing up these drives. Just go JBOD.",1342713654

Also CSRF protection doesn't protect against clickjacking attacks where the page is iframed set transparent and user is encouraged to click in a specific location(punch the monkey in the face) on the attackers page. Easiest solution is to use javascript to detect if your page is iframed and bust out of it.",1342713636

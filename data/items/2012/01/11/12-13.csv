From a business standpoint, the relevant metric would be the economic value of the code produced and assuming rational actors (as the author's argument must) then the value of the code produced by each team must on average be roughly proportional to its size - else, the allocation of resources be irrational.<p>Computational efficiency also tends to correlate with cost per line of code in a the man month model the author requires wherein all programmers are of the interchangeable 10k a month type.<p>Finally, large teams are likely to operate in environments where large teams are required due to bureaucratic overburden, the very environments where $1.8 million dollar coding expenses are both justified and common.",1326286694

3451524,comment,3451375,3451375,2,0,marcusf,,,"Good to see an article with some justifications and data instead of random assertions. Usually articles like this are filled with platitudes in lieu of real research, and the whole 'preaching to the choir' thing can get tiresome even if you're part of the choir.<p>Though I'm not sure the QSM article is strong proof of much anything, really. They don't seem to test for e.g. language or problem domain, and while SLOC has a relationship to the defect rate I'm not entirely sure I agree it's a good comparison metric, nor does it say anything about the success rate of the projects.<p>That said, one obvious reason for having a 30 man team to develop something is because it's composed of a multitude of disciplines. A software/hardware project might require people with deep skills in digital electronics, analog electronics, software development not to mention domain experts for what they're interfacing. Assuming the thing has an interface you might want a UI guy, then there's the supply chain and manufacturing to take in to account.<p>It's not hard to see that it could swell to thirty people quite quickly.",1326286636

There is a know denial of service issue caused by the specific hashing algorithm that everybody seems to use.<p>Everybody fixes it by randomizing tables used by said algorithm at initialization time.<p>PHP ""fixes"" it by not touching the hash algorithm and adding a max_input_vars configuration setting, thereby reducing the functionality while not really fixing the underlying security issue. This also means that if max_input_vars is set reasonably high (or has to be set as such), an attacker can still do the exact same DOS attack - albeit using more concurrent connections.<p>I can't even believe that the desire to keep backwards compatibility at all costs is a valid reason for a decision like this: Older versions supported an arbitrary amount of input fields, the current version does not, so this is a clear BC break.<p>Especially when considering that PHP is getting better with their release process (i.e. not having 100s of failing tests so that the 101st that fails would be missed), I really think this half-assed solution is way too cautious - especially as other projects had the exact same issue and solved it more correctly - without causing (apparent) regressions so far.<p>PHP could just - again - copy their updated algorithm.<p>(related discussion on their mailing list: <a href=""http://news.php.net/php.internals/57291"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.php.net/php.internals/57291</a>)",1326286582

Not enough people care enough about open access for it to happen.<p>I'm not telling anybody to shut up, just that if they want to change something, they should identify and remedy the correct causes of that something, rather than fighter windmills. Hollow rhetoric like ""In effect, we have too much organizational scarring tissue in science. It could be that we need to reboot the system. As a starting point, we should collectively recognize the problem. Repeat after me: scholarship is not a publishing business"" is just a misrepresentation of the situation.<p>Finally, I don't agree nor disagree with the complaint - I just don't care, much like most other researchers I know - and by extension, I suspect, most other researchers tout court.

Take the texsearch example above. Given a LaTeX string I want to find similar strings from a large corpus so I start by googling things like ""code search"" and ""syntax tree search"". After scanning a few dozen papers and following links I find that the magic search term is ""approximate string matching"" which nets me an overview  paper. I scan through the links from that paper and dismiss most of the algorithms as unsuitable for my particular problem until I'm left with a few candidates for prototypes.<p>Back then I had access through my university.

Last year (in Canada) we worked on a project with 20+ undergrads. We had 3 hours of meetings a week, made up of presentations, discussion etc. This year (in the UK) I'm working in a team of four people. I've achieved significantly more this year than I did last year.<p>Perhaps the biggest reason is that when you have a team of four, every hour you spend meeting involves approximately 15 minutes talking about the problems you're having, and discussing the solutions to your problems. In the team of 20, I'd go to a meeting, spend three hours there and 2 of them would be taken up by a particular aspect of the project.

The STL, with Boost to extend it, is one; but it stays pretty basic. Qt is another. Glib, with Glibmm/Gtkmm &co is a third one, but the core implementation is C and Vala because that makes the platform accessible to a lot more languages. libxml2, cited in the original post, reimplements a lot of basic data structures, because it intends to be portable to C code which doesn't have a common platform. Other languages have CPAN, Hackage, PyPI, RubyGems, Maven, npm, and their libraries reuse and rely on each other a lot more freely.",1326285252

The cost of continuing to take photographs is also fairly minimal compared to earlier. The buyers price flexibility has not changed while your ability to produce at a lower cost has improved considerably.<p>C) You cannot equate yourself with a restaurant or a secretary or a writer in these companies, they unlike you are paid to continue working on a daily basis, whereas you're expecting to be paid for work that is already done. once.

In other words, the legitimate product is not ""one print"", it is the whole set of prints that you expect it to sell over its lifetime. If you can guarantee that a print is exclusive, then you can legitimately expect the kind of amount conventional economic calculation leads you to value your photograph at ( im not talking about 6612$, thats insane )<p>D) The true comparison is to that of a restaurant that comes up for one day, makes an innovate dish, and then exits the business the next day and expects to be paid whenever someone else makes the dish elsewhere. No one does this because you can not run a profitable venture or even make up your costs based on this mindset - based on one sessions sales. And draconian IP laws aside, the only way to make a profit in that venture is to stay in business and keep at producing that dish over and over again, and more over, innovating with new standout dishes.

There were some golden parts that were enlightening but these were few and far between.<p>COM1004 - Web and Internet Technology:\nCryptography - not taught at A-level.\nEthics, law, piracy - taught at A-level.<p>COM1005 - Machines and Intelligence:\nThe first semester of this was writing about AI because we 'didn't know how to program'.\nThe second semester was learning systems which was very enjoyable and quite complicated.<p>COM1006 - Devices and Networks:\nAnything that was taught at A-Level (boolean logic etc) was extended on and there was little time spent on basic stuff.<p>If they had made Computing A-level a requirement I'd have gained just shy of 6 months education I reckon (4500 for future years), and if Computing A-level was extended upon to improve it then they'd be able to teach even more interesting topics. I think the requirement of Mathematics (which was required at my university, but not all) just shows a general aptitude in the appropriate areas, and only had direct relevance to two modules (one during first year and one in second year).<p>Any course with too many applicants for its spaces (the top Universities) could require Computing A-Level if it became more mainstream and I believe this would increase the standard of education possible.<p>EDIT:\nTo bring my point back round the article. This news makes me happy because a move from ICT towards Computing at GCSE would likely increase numbers taking Computing at A-level and definitely increase the quality of the A-Level.

So share the small image for free with whomever wants to see it, then charge a small fortune for a steganographically watermarked 10MB one.

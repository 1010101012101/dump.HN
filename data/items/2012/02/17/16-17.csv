The identity of the function to be executed is hidden from the caller.  If that's really your requirement, then you're using the wrong language, the ship sailed.<p>I agree with mistercow: default arguments are, on the whole, a Good Thing.  Think of them as a restricted form of overloading which requires (much!) less code to be written.<p>Obviously they can be misused, but again, that's the nature of programming (and especially of C++).

3603992,comment,3602746,3603823,3,0,mistercow,,,"I am always suspicious of advice based on studies of ""what successful people do"" because there is a high potential for false causality, and for inapplicability to other people's lives. I suspect that many of these habits of successful people are simply side effects of the way that their minds work, and that they may not work for someone whose mind works differently. Ripe bananas are yellow, but painting a green banana yellow does not ripen it.<p>I will speculate as to how it might be that being successful is correlated with looking forward, even if that is not an inherent fact: the ""to-do list"" is a familiar, well-known concept, while the ""done list"" is not. So if you're motivated by the future, you have a ready-made tool that will make you more successful. If you're motivated by your recent accomplishments, you have no such tool - and you may even make things worse by using a future-motivating tool that is not effective for you.<p>Like I said, this is speculation and hypothesis. But I will say from experience that it is often the case that person A has a habit that seems effective, and person B sees no benefit from adopting that habit.",1329497953

I think the author chose it because in his mind veganism has to do with health.  Nothing wrong with that association (i don't think there's anything wrong with veganism, either), but in most people's minds veganism = restrictions mixed with a sense of superiority.  And the thing is, there's nothing about demanding that actual content be present in your media that places a restriction on what content enters your brain.  As the author points out, the content you are presently getting is what's restricted by virtue of being so barren of fact.<p>So if you were to stick with the food metaphor (not that I think that's a good idea), veganism doesn't real work.

If you have any noticeable latency (read: everything on mobile, desktop clients not close to a server), needing to go back to the server to render will ruin the perceived performance of your app. Well-written applications running on the client can take a change and optimistically render that before the change has even been persisted back to the database.

3603950,comment,3603047,3603379,2,0,Symmetry,,,"<i>Atom Diamondville also has a higher IPC than the current ARMv7</i>\nI'm not sure what you mean here.  ARMv7 is an ISA, not an architecture, so different ARM cores that run ARMv7 code, everything from the A5 to the A15, will have radically different IPCs even though they can have the same set of instructions for a given program.<p>And you can't even really compare the IPC of processor architectures with different ISAs directly, its often easier to solve a problem in one ISA with less instructions than in a different ISA.  RISC architectures often do less work per instruction than CISC architectures, but ARM has some features like instruction predication and argument shifting that mean that its individual instruction are often more powerful than, say, MIPS.<p>And it is actually fair to compare processor that have different clock rates, because often the architecture determines how fast a chip you can make.  Itanium servers are only clocked at around half the speed of other architectures because the ISA is very complex and that's as fast as they can make them, and so comparing e.g. Power and Itanium processors of equal clock speed would be horribly unfair to the decisions that Power made that allow them to clock so high.<p>So to get a fair comparison you really want to just build the best processor of a given architecture you can on a given process, and let them fight it out like they do here.  This can be pretty hard to do, since the performance of different company's processes on a given node can be rather different.  I seem to recall that Intel could put maybe 20% more current through a N-gate on the 65nm node than their competitors, for instance, but using the same process would be the ideal.",1329497426

This is so prevalent in tech (and has been for decades) it's passed from ""not funny"" to trope.  Company launches (itself, product), hires PR team, shops story to various media outlets, breathless hagiography ensues.  The real market is usually 1) investors and 2) market shaping (for consumer products), though influencing legislative and regulatory environments (as in the Google car story) may also be a goal.<p>- ""News"" as linkbait / attention generator.

Photographs of family are ways of recording all the faces of a family within a photo and family album is the treasure trove for such photographs. Now days, there are professionals skilled in capturing family photography and designing photo albums through which one get the best shots of a family. Family photography has become one of the types of photography as an art form. Family photographs can be of various types: formal family photographs, casual family photos, fun family photographs and so on. While formal family photos are those where the entire family poses in a formal posture along with formal attire and a formal background, casual photos of family are those where family poses casually in front of the camera for a picture. Formal photographs of family can be used for official records of family or just framing them in the drawing room. On the other hand, fun family photographs can be classified as those which capture lively moments of the family such as snaps of picnic, festivals, birthdays, marriages and so on. Fun family pictures capture the real moments of a family and record them. There are hosts of choices to create a family album. One can give it a formal look or make it a complete random collection.

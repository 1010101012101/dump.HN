My cousin got a BA in international relations in the US and then went and attended school in Spain. Something like only 1/4 of his credits counted towards his degree there even though nearly all of them transferred. His explanation was that they expect less of a broad education and more specialization.<p>Recalling my own experience I got a BA in political science and I spent something like 30 hours in my major, and 90+ in general education.<p>It seems as though many people on HN (and in general) talk about how we need more STEM majors, but then complain that a degree that's very highly technical isn't broad enough.

Some reports with exaggeration. Blame the first group if you want for their cowardice. If second group is alive and kicking, your point is proven to be false.<p>- Taksim Square was actually totally closed to 1st of May events from 1978 to 2010 . It was this government allowed opening it again. This year there is construction so it was not allowed. I remember the horror in Kadikoy in 1996 tough.<p>""People could express themselves more freely if they were not religious or if they were against the government. Now they fear retaliation, losing their job etc.""  This is just your opinion. I cannot really prove the opposite either. Nepotism is there tough, and cannot be avoided regardless of any government.<p>Journalism issue is problematic and a shame. Most are really PKK related and probably this will change. I cannot say this is something new tough.<p>""Scientists and artists are ridiculed routinely by the politicians in power"" they push each others wrong buttons, and politicians are less tolerable indeed. But apart from 1-2 incidents this cannot be generalized. It is a shame that PM does not have a sense of humor.<p>To me, Turkish Academy of Sciences issue is overrated. ""Most"" guys there weren't doing anything useful in terms of science there anyway. They continue their work in universities or in Tubitak without a loss. Handling of Science and Technology by this government can be criticized but for better or worse, they pour perhaps x10 more money on R&D than previous governments.<p>Do not know what really happened behind pardus and Gokturk issue.

5813225,comment,5812807,5812807,4,0,artagnon,,,"Generally speaking, I think today's philosophy courses should focus on the big historical picture with emphasis on modern philosophers, as opposed to studying tomes like The Republic in painful detail.  While it's easy to get lost in a sea of infinitely regressing metaphysics, I think there's value in applied philosophy (I don't think philosophy is useful in isolation).<p>1. The scientific method.  Starting from the logical positivist school of thought, philosophers are converging at falsifiability as the primary criterion (cf. Popper, Wittgenstein).<p>2. Justice.  Starting with rather crude notions of utilitarianism, it is possible to construct a transcendental notion of justice that is based on fairness (cf. Rawls, Sen).  It is also possible to approach it from a theory on transcendental morality (cf. Kant).<p>3. Consciousness.  This is a rather tricky topic that can be tackled by an analytical philosopher who has studied some neuroscience (cf. Metzinger).<p>4. Tackling the free will problem.  When tackled in isolation, there is a dichotomy between compatibilism and incompatibilism (cf. Schopenhauer).  However, attempts have been made to derive it from quantum decoherence and MWI (cf. Yudkowsky on LessWrong [1]).<p>5. Foundations of mathematics.  While there are prominent platonists (cf. Gdel), there are several alternative approaches to the problem (cf. Spinoza, Hilbert).<p>To conclude, I'd say that some training in philosophical thought is essential to enabling the student in thinking about various questions that pop up during her lifetime.  The goal is not to get definitive answers, but to have a good consistent framework to think in.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Free_will_(solution)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Free_will_(solution)</a>",1370267405

Developing a new feature necessarily involves stages where the code is unsuitable for release, if you're doing it right - you should have tests or, better, language support that will prevent you from releasing something nonfunctional, and the feature will go through nonfunctional stages (even accepting that you can and should implement it as piecemeal as possible). You should of course be merging as often as possible, as often as you can deploy - which might be hourly or better, if you have a good continuous deployment setup - but it's still valuable to be able to make commits at a finer granularity than that. So you use branches for that grouping (and I think 1 branch = 1 ""feature"" = 1 deployment is a good model), and commits for finer-grained history.",1370267395

If it was me and that was at least a reasonable wage in Brazil, then I would use this company to gain some credibility and negotiate with them not for more money, but for the opportunity to use them as a US based reference for more work.  Doing this will help you secure additional work and let you increase yours rates as you go.<p>I have this argument with a lot of people in the US, where I am at.  They feel because San Francisco based contractors charge $225/hr or more sometimes, that it should be the same in their area.  Generally they use the argument that the contractor out there is no smarter or better than they are.  Frankly, it goes based off what the market will bare in the area you are working and the area the company is located combined.  That is why you don't see large contracting firms with one standard rate, they tailor it based on location, service and perceived corporate value.<p>Also, you asked about charging by the week instead.  I am a huge fan of this, charge by the week, agree to a reasonable deliverable each week and then you control your hours significantly more.  It also stops the extra scrutiny of your invoices where many times the accounting group will push projects to shave fractions of an hour to save themselves cash.  A flat fixed weekly rate is easy for them to budget, pay and removes most of that extra scrutiny.  Lastly, if you switch to weekly, just remember that if you make a promise for that week, you have to deliver no matter what the hours you work are; and if that isn't going to be possible, you need to communicate the issue as far in advance of that week as possible with specifics to realign expectations.",1370267354

They were developed when the internet was a club of like minded people rather than a global public space. Things like: a lack of rock solid authentication, no guarantees of transit privacy (much less at rest privacy), clunky formatting, multimedia and hypermedia support, arcane attachment problems, and only hacked on support for anything beyond 1:N messaging (e.g. mailing lists).<p>A lot of these problems have good, solid, proposed solutions but inertia and collective action problems mean that near universal support for protocol additions / changes take years if not decades.<p>The second, more amorphous, set of problems have to do with how some people use email pervasively in their lives in a fashion that (inevitably) would be more efficiently accomplished with a tool specialized to their needs. So for example, people who spend a fair amount of time in a corporate enviorment with Exchange often bitterly miss the calendar management integration. They say that vanilla email is broken because it has no equivalent capability.

In Java, as in many garbage-collected languages, it is not possible to construct an interior pointer like this, but in Go it is idiomatic. This design point affects which collection algorithms can be used, and may make them more difficult, but after careful thought we decided that it was necessary to allow interior pointers because of the benefits to the programmer and the ability to reduce pressure on the (perhaps harder to implement) collector. So far, our experience comparing similar Go and Java programs shows that use of interior pointers can have a significant effect on total arena size, latency, and collection times.</i><p>Interior pointers may pose a problem for sophisticated GCs.

How about just taking the news for what it is and take in what you want and leave the rest. Am I odd in that I don't have any emotional reaction when I hear of a rape, murder, or most other tragedies on the news? I was in Europe during the Oklahoma tornadoes and when I heard about it on the news when I came back I thought ""hmm, so this is the new big story for the next week"" before falling asleep.

There is a very interesting and subtle social media campaign backed by yet to be seen figures who are making this a much bigger/disingenious issue than it really is. The interesting facts you should realise are that Erdogan and his political party won the last three elctions, increasing their support by about 3 - 5% each round. Their last win saw them secure 49.4% of the vote, which means over three terms of power they've actually increased their support base by 15%.<p>So why are there protests?<p>Well theyre not about a tree unsurprisingly. There are 3 political factions who have subverted the initial protest, the BDP, CHP and TKP parties which are socialist, communist, secular or a combination of them (TKP being the most extreme).<p>Surprisingly, these three parties were recently holding protest against Erdogans decision to allow refugees from Syria to enter Turkey. Yes, the three parties who are apparantly looking after the wellbeing of trees in a park don't want refugees of war entering Turkey (though no one mentiosn the fact that these three parties also support Assad because the Baath party is/was communist and secular too).<p>Theres also the DHKP which is an extremist communist (terrorist?) party which hates the fact that the leader of Turkey is a practising Muslim and that Islam is seeing a revival in Turkey.<p>So try to read between the lines and see that theres more to the story than trees. Redditors and HN folks seem to be falling hook line and sinker for a fantastic marketing astro turfing campaign.<p>Just a few more pointers. During erdogans reign he improved the minimum wage by 500%, allowed farmers to access capital at a 5% interest rate as opposed to the initial 54% and paid off the last installment towards the IMF freeing them of all their debts. For the first time in modern era, Turkey now owes no money to the IMF and is the 15th largets economy in the world.<p>Turkey does have problems, but theres more to this story that meets the eye and people need to wonder why and how this has blown up so successfully on social media sites.",1370265476

So I've had two formal introductory philosophy classes, in different languages, cultures and contexts, but definitely aimed at the same public (17-19 y. old). It's quite interesting to compare these two. In France the focus was definitely more on authors, philosophical theories, texts and ideas. In America the material was more on reasoning, logic and formal arguments. Never once were we presented a formal Modus Ponens layout in France. We were told never to write our own ideas in our essays --- ""You'll do that if you get a master in philosophy"". However the American class had too much of ""learn those 10 arguments by heart"" I would say. So they definitely had subtle and interesting differences.<p>Of course both had their share of ""how the hell is this relevant to my life"" reactions. But also those invaluable ""ahah"" moments, which make philosophy so wonderful. Hacking has this too. You walk out of the classroom with new cognitive pathways that you didn't know you had. You'll never see the world with the same eyes again.",1370265390

5813016,comment,5810890,5810954,1,0,delwin,,,"Thanks for the response! Your points addressed in order:<p>First, if college is all about social interaction, then it's hardly worth the money. I can go to conferences, take non-university classes, pay for coworking spaces, and intern at places all for much cheaper than college. I found it very difficult to interact socially at UT  the campus is enormous, making it rare for me to randomly run into people, and also, I grew up in Austin, so I already had a pretty solid base of friends and there was little pressure to find new ones (though I did meet many people, mostly through friends I already had).<p>I think your views on the CS degree are pretty much why I didn't get that degree. I don't want to be comfortably employed; I have no intention of making my life a linear path from college -> work -> family -> retirement. I don't ever plan to retire, because there is nothing I love more than challenging my creativity. If I had a CS degree, I would probably have a pretty high paying job in a nice place right now, but I certainly wouldn't be traveling 5 months out of the year (and in 2014, 11 months if things go according to plan). I like programming, and especially designing, for the web, but I also like working for myself. I have a pretty decent portfolio, and although I haven't gotten any huge jobs yet (biggest so far are a dating social network and a minisite for NASA), I make enough to support myself and my travels.<p>I also think getting a degree in CS would have minimized my passion for it. Getting a degree in linguistics certainly stamped out any ambitions I had on becoming a professional linguist. Although, I <i>did</i> get an enormous amount of value out of all of the electives I was able to take because linguistics is only a 24-hour major. I would have, no doubt, learned more computer science, but I know enough right now to get paid to do it, which gives me the freedom to learn it on my own time. And, I'm trying to transition to becoming a designer right now, which is its own set of challenges; something I would have completely ignored had I been taking a CS degree.<p>Lastly, traveling is <i>definitely</i> not cheaper when you're going through the university. When I travel, I stay on couches (CouchSurfing) or work on farms and homesteads (WWOOF), giving me guaranteed access to social interaction and informal education (I am staying on a farm in the mountains of North Carolina for two months while I work on a full-length album at their music studio, this will cost me $150/mo. in rent  and they are eager to teach me everything they know about foraging, which is very popular in this region, given all of the naturally occurring edible plants and fungi; I have also budgeted around $900-1200 for a two-month trip to Peru).<p>In sum:\n - Social interaction can be found elsewhere, for free. College is about learning, at least for me.\n - The CS degree probably would have been a good idea for someone who wanted a comfortable, stable livelihood after college. This is not me.\n - Using the university to travel would have cost a lot more than my current travel plans. I would have certainly learned a lot studying abroad, but since I plan to be ""studying"" and traveling ""abroad"" for most of my life, I<p>Thanks for the advice, but it is really geared towards someone who is headed for a different path, something more stable, something with a larger salary. Living my life through challenges and adventures is exactly how I want to do it. It pushes my mind and creativity to new places, and I have no plans to become stagnant.<p>Also, if I had the money, you bet I would go back to school. I would get a Bachelors in history, computer science, music, design, biology, and physics and anything else I could. I love classes, and I love going to lectures. This is why I'm so excited about MOOCs.",1370265218

Google's search suggestions and related searches would be regarded as examples of AI. See <a href=""http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~isb9112/dept/phil341/wisai/WhatisAI.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~isb9112/dept/phil341/wisai/Wha...</a> for a good explanation.<p>You seem to be getting stuck on the title of the patent application, and this has absolutely no effect whatsoever on the scope of the claimed invention and is, as far as patent validity is concerned completely irrelevant and must only be generally related to the disclosure.<p>""The patent should protect the implementation, not the idea""... That is exactly what this application seeks to do! It's seeking to protect their implementation of performing a search or giving suggestions (or something similar, on an iPhone and don't want to have to read it again on here). But you can't do that by providing source code, it would make the patent worthless because someone sticking some extra irrelevant step in the middle could claim it doesn't do the same thing. If you invented a new toaster that used one tenth the energy and took a tenth as long, would you want to be able to stop people using the same mechanism that allowed you to do that? Or would you want to be able to only stop people from making a toaster that is exactly the same as the one you've created, and if someone adds a cooling rack on top, you couldn't stop them from taking your idea which you've invested time and effort in. This is exactly the same for software patents. You patent inventive solutions to problems, in a way that means you can protect it in all it's forms, just just the one way you've written it in the one language you've chosen to do so.<p>Of course people should be able to apply for patents for mere ideas before actual creation; this is how you make money from being an inventor for anything more than simple back shed ideas: you come up with a novel and inventive way to do something, you talk to a patent attorney and apply for a patent, and then you go to investors and say ""hey, I have this awesome idea that can make you money. Give me money to implement it, and my patent will insure that only you are allowed to use that idea or to licence it to those of your choosing"". The patent system is all about protecting ideas, but people chuck a spaz when it's not something as tangible as a new gearbox or a new chemical or a new piece of mining equipment or whatever it is. It is my firm belief that people who come up with novel and inventive ideas through hard work and often a lot of their own money should be able to protect others from stealing their ideas. Without this, there is almost no incentive for people to form start ups with great new ideas they've had; large companies are free to just take their ideas and there's nothing that can be done about it.",1370264416

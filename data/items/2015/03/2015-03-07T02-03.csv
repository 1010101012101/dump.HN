9160779,comment,9158812,9160714,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The U.S. Department of Labor looked at the actual reasons.[1] It&#x27;s predominantly because men statistically choose to enter higher paying professions and specialties, work longer hours and take fewer days off. Accounting for such things leaves the pay gap in the neighborhood of 5%, and the DoL concludes that it could in principle explain more of it if they had better data available. Here&#x27;s the last paragraph of the summary:<p>&quot;Although additional research in this area is clearly needed, this study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.&quot;<p>The entire issue is just politics. For example, studies have shown that taller people make significantly more money than shorter people, by an amount that exceeds the unexplained pay gap between men and women based on the average height difference between men and women. Back of the envelope math then implies that women get paid more than men of the same height who do the same job.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20...</a>",1425696827

What I recall is that most of the time the absolut top performers have been men and not woman , but contrary to this I dont really recall many woman being at the bottom of the class in any subject. This effect i woud say was because most of the girls did almost all assignments and maybe tried to not leave the given path in a way, but also did not try to stand out that much so they were willing to work more for school. While the boys generally were good in some subjekt and focused on their strengths but we were not as willing to pull up our efforts in those subjects we thought of as not really needed for our future.<p>I really can relate with this I since I myself was really strong in all science and math related subjects as well as in english and art... but regarding languages like latin i did fail , sometimes even handing in a completly white paper, since i could choose which subjekts were going to count in my Abitur ( think of it as A levels ).",1425696813

       &quot;auto&quot; is the new way to type variables in C++: it
       infers the type of the variable from the type of the
       expression */
    22: auto index = dist(engine);

    /* The following lines are a bit more complex, as they
       contain a nested expression. Let us focus on the inner
       expression:
           (index < size ) ? array[index]
              : map.insert({index, min + index}).first->second

       This is in the form:
           test-expr ? when-true-expr
              : when-false-expr

       This expression is a ternary condition. What it means
       is that the expression before the question mark is
       computed (index < size), and if it evaluates to true,
       the overall expression will resolve to the result of
       the expression between the question mark and the colon,
       otherwise it resolves to what is after the colon.

       Here, it means that if &quot;index&quot; is smaller than &quot;size&quot;,
       use &quot;array[index]&quot;, otherwise insert a new entry in the
       map, with key &quot;index&quot; and value &quot;min+index&quot;, then reuse

           its member pair::first set to an iterator pointing 
           to either the newly inserted element or to the 
           element with an equivalent key in the map. The 
           pair::second element in the pair is set to true if 
           a new element was inserted or false if an equivalent
           key already existed.

    getvar
    push &quot;b&quot;
    getvar
    add
    push &quot;c&quot;

    getvar R2, &quot;b&quot;
    add R3, R1, R2
    setvar R3, &quot;c&quot;

The thing is, if the register machine can have a single getvar instruction which takes immediate operand and a register, why can&#x27;t the stack machine also have a single instruction which also takes an immediate operand and and pushes onto the stack:<p><pre><code>    pushvar &quot;a&quot;
    pushvar &quot;b&quot;
    add
    popvar &quot;c&quot;

Now the instruction stream looks denser: just four instructions, and none of them reference a register, so they can have a smaller encoding, perhaps.<p>Vice versa, the register machine&#x27;s instruction stream density can be puffed up if we don&#x27;t have a getvar instruction that takes an immediate operand, but only a register pair:<p><pre><code>    load R1, &quot;a&quot;

They&#x27;ll work crazy hours, take prod-support duties with no expectation of reward, and do the grunt work without asking whether it benefits their careers. It&#x27;s not that they don&#x27;t care about their careers; it&#x27;s that they still believe that their careers are perfectly correlated with the success of the company, and will make a lot of unwise sacrifices. They often overestimate how locked-in their promotions are (they expect to grow with the company, and are shocked when it doesn&#x27;t happen) and the future improvement of their equity position.<p>See, non-founding employees in most startups get very small equity slices-- it&#x27;s typically about 2% * N<i></i>(-1.2) for employee #N; this means that only about 11% will <i>ever</i> be allocated to non-founding employees, which is about right-- and fall into two categories: (a) those who don&#x27;t take the equity seriously, work 9-to-5, and optimize for their careers-- and this can work out well for the company because there are benefits to doing well at a reputable startup-- (b) true believers who think their initial 0.5% (as Employee #3) is just a &quot;teaser&quot; and will be re-uped to &quot;the real amount&quot; 10x higher once they prove themselves. Of course, that isn&#x27;t the case. In fact, that only happens in event of a major promotion and those are rare because (although there are exceptions) startups tend to get the Social Climber Complex and hand out new executive positions to externals.<p>Around 25 people is where employees&#x27; equity slices drop below the 0.1% mark, which is when it&#x27;s clear that they&#x27;re not really owners or genuine partners in the company, and probably never will be.

a demonstrated interest in self-educating
experience with distributed version control (git/mercurial/etc.)
comfortable with 2+ programming languages including Javascript
familiarity w/ datastores (e.g. SQL, Redis, ElasticSearch)
AngularJS, Django experience encouraged. Bonus if you have experience with single page apps!<p>We’re a small team and you’ll be working closely with other product team members on the design of interfaces between frontend and backend.

Booking for children that don&#x27;t have an account is something we&#x27;re planning to add.  Here are details about how Authorized Users work:

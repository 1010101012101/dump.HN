I went to a special school. (To give you an idea of the environment, imagine a one room school with a solitary space barred by magnetic lock in the back.) And I took the bus there and back. One day while I was walking out from school to the bus, I noticed something yellow and shiny on the ground; a golden bracelet. Stepped on, worn, and mostly scrap, but a golden bracelet nonetheless. In my childhood naivet I shouted ""Hey everyone! I found a golden bracelet!"".<p>The entire mob of fleeing kids turned around to look at me, and then just as quickly as they'd noticed, melted back into their rush to the buses. When I got home the lead instructor called to ask for the bracelet because ""A couple had lost it."". This smelled like bull because as I mentioned, it was mostly scrap by this point. Probably $5 of scrap gold. So my parents ask if I'm going to give it to her:<p>My answer was not a chance in hell. So I went in the next day and she pulled me aside to ask for the bracelet. She asks ""Where's the bracelet?"". I smile and inform her that ""She's not getting it."". When she asks the inevitable ""why?"" my enthusiasm is boiling over with excitement.<p>I matter-of-fact-ly tell her the truth:<p>""I don't give things to rip off artists.""<p>And into the solitary room I went. (I think, my memories fuzzy after that part.)<p>(If you ask me about it now, theres reasons why that was really really cool, and just as many if not more why that was really really <i>not cool.</i>)<p>What I wrote above is probably the mild version of what 9 year old me would have done if he got his hands on the cameras.<p>EDIT: I am aware that most nine year olds are probably nothing like this.

In practice this generally only refers to cell phones and iPods, I can usually pull out a laptop and the faculty doesn't care, but they can also apply that rule whenever it makes their jobs easier. For example, I started recording classes to enhance my notes, and the school told me I must cease doing so, originally because they claimed it was an invasion of the teachers' privacy (!), then later that it was an invasion of students' privacy; but when I argued that the state law against recording people without their consent only applied to private conversations, and that no conversation could be considered private in a public place such as a school, they responded by simply saying that I can't record because it involve the use of an electronic device.",1339742465

(If you're interested in mobile app development.)<p>I've long wondered why there isn't an app that turns cell phones into functional TTY machines for the deaf and hard of hearing. Like many of us, the deaf community has cell phones, but unlike many of us, they still need TTY machines for many functions. These tools are not cheap, being over $100. I see no reason the functionality can't be emulated cheaply, or for free, by smart phones.<p>Currently turning on TTY modes on a cell phone only enable hearing Baudot tones. An app should listen to the phone call, interpret the Baudot tones (at a paltry 45 baud at worse, but there are proprietary and alternative protocols[0]) into text on screen, and then transmit Baudot tones at the same rate when typed.<p>If you can figure it out (I'm sure there's a reason why it isn't done already,) then I'm sure you could charge a few bucks for it. Figure there's ~28M deaf people in the US? There's plenty with cell phones, especially younger people.<p>Such tech could also just receive Baudot and send voice (VCO; Voice Carry Over), and receive voice and send Baudot (HCO; Hearing Carry Over). It could even be used for cell to cell TTY calls, letting the deaf and hard of hearing communicate using minutes instead of texts or data.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_device_for_the_deaf#Protocols"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_device_for_t...</a>",1339742463

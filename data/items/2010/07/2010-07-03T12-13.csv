Something needs to be working right now, it is easiest to just do it, etc. Also, scaling and deployment issues come up, and best to just deal with stuff. The question is what fraction of time is spent on sysadmin vs. development. BTW, I look forward to checking out mongrel2, and I think using the AGPL + optional commercial licensing is a good plan.",1278161293

Perhaps there's where you're looking?  The C# jobs are going to tend to be in larger corporate America (in the US, obviously.<p>Personally I think MS has been painting themselves in to  the corner of only being a viable toolset for larger corporate America due to their pricing.  They acknowledge this themselves with programs like BizSpark and WebsiteSpark.<p>It's a good language, and .NET is a powerful framework, just very tied to the Windows platform (mono notwithstanding).  And the Windows platform is pretty expensive compared to other platforms.  Although the tools are very nice, if it comes down to spending thousands on premium tools vs saving thousands and learning to do stuff 'by hand', most startups choose the 'by hand' route.  BizSpark and/or WebsiteSpark can help reduce that upfront cost for a few years, but at some point you'll need to pay the piper.<p>If you <i>want</i> to work in a startup working in the web space,  PHP/Ruby/Python will be the way to go.  Those are even runnable on Windows - MS has made a lot of commitment to getting PHP running well on Windows.  If you're looking for a high-paying corporate job, C# may be the better route, depending on where you're located. Oh, you're on Cinci - there should be a lot of options between Cinci, KY, IN, and perhaps TN or PA.  You're a few hours from a lot of places.<p>Good luck!",1278160626

They know they are rockstars, they know that they can get funding for their own product at a moments notice, they know that they can always go on a speaking tour.<p>You need them, but they don't need you, and they know it. So they walk in and want to do what they want to do, they have no intention of doing the shitty stuff. But work in a company has a lot of shitty stuff to be done.<p>The problem with Zed is that though he is a good developer, he's also a good writer and probably a good talker. Those last two are important to him, and when people work at companies, they should not be having two big side projects (writing and talking). It distracts from the work.<p>All the rockstar programmers of the last few years all seemed to have entered CTO roles, have started their own companies, or are important people in very big companies. Very few are still just slugging away at code at small startups.<p>This story is basically why you should not hire rockstar programmers.

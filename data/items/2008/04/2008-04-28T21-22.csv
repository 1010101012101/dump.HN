But the web2py ORM is much better integrated with the rest of the framework than SQLAlchemy is integrated with, for example, Pylons or TurboGears. If you do not use the entire web2py framework you are better off with SQLAlchemy. If you do use web2py, you are better off with its own ORM. Here are some preliminary benchmarks (take them with grain of salt)

176066,comment,175864,175864,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Charles Pellegrino/George Zebrowski covers this in _The Killing Star_ (1995).  They reason as follows:<p><pre><code>  1. Any species will place its own survival before that of a different species.
  2. Any species that has made it to the top on its planet of origin will be 
     intelligent, alert, aggressive, and ruthless when necessary.
  3. They will assume that the first two rules apply to us.

So any starfaring species might well destroy another starfaring species -- immediately.  In _The Killing Star_ the aliens do so at the first opportunity with high-powered relativistic bombardment.  The power that they use dwarfs that generated by asteroid impacts and past mass extictions.  They blanket the entire hemisphere of planets with relativistic projectiles!

176062,comment,175619,175881,0,0,astine,,,"I've found that the specialized tools philosophy to be effective when building a, well a toolkit. Toolkits, if done well, are extensible and interoperable in ways that no 'integrated' system can be. However, There is a certain class of problem that doesn't really lend itself to the toolkit approach. This is the interface problem.<p>Vim is an awesome text editor, it is streamlined in a way most editors could only dream of. It's a very good text editor. Python is a very good language. One of it's nice features is that it comes with a REPL, so I can program in it interactively. Using a third program Screen, I run both side-by-side and pipe content between them. This is the toolkit at work, and it works very well.<p>However, there is a slight problem here. Each of these programs has a different interface design. Each has a separate key-binding scheme and different schemes collide. You have to learn three different interfaces and learn them well, to do this effectively. It would be nice if there was a program, similar to screen, that would stand between you and the editor and interpretor and allow you rebind and customize your keys and view ports so that they don't collide and are consistent. This program is emacs. It is the universal interface, a more flexible bash than bash, and people stay in it all day, not because they don't use toolkits, but because they prefer to use it to interface with toolkits rather than bash or some ill-conceived X monstrosity.<p>Emacs doesn't replace cvs/git, ls, grep, awk, gdb, gcc, python, rbi, cron... It mostly just provides a very powerful scriptable interface to all of them.",1209419203

176052,comment,175604,175985,0,0,aflag,,,"I haven't really taken the time to analyse that. Most of my work is academic and I fear I may not have enough economics background. I do have an early idea that it sounds more like a myth than a fact.<p>Let's say a company wants to outsource the development of some software they need. They go ahead and contract your company. You develop it and sell it to them for a certain price. Even if the license is free it's not very likely that they will redistribute it for other companies, and even if they do, it probably won't fit their needs just right. OTOH, they will be able to call other companies (other than yours) to maintain your software. So they have that extra freedom. And it doesn't really hurt business because, if you do a better job maintaining your software than other people, chances are your client won't switch.<p>There's also the case of the end desktop user. That's probably harder territory for earning money with free software. But I've never seen some company selling their software but giving the user a package with the GPL-licensed code. Sure, after a while there would be lots of other non-official sites to download the program from, but doesn't that already happen with all the proprietary softwares nowadays? And it's not like anti-piracy laws are doing any good against it. This way people may do their own derivative work, for which they might even charge just like you. Now you'll have competition, so things get more interesting and you have to make better stuff. Why can't that work?<p>You can still charge for constant patches you deliver (though they are all GPL'd). If it's an online game, you might charge for your server, and so on. A big part of software nowadays seem to be services, anyway.<p>Say google opens the source for their search engine. Why would you turn to a different site other than google.com? It would make great research environment, nonetheless. Even google could gain from it.<p>So, what I'm saying is that I don't see a reason why people can't earn money while keeping their software free. Even though things might get a little different from what they are today. That's good, though, because today is far from perfect. And I think free software is a move in the right direction.",1209418848

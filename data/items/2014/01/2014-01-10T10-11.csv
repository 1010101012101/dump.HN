7036048,comment,7035030,7035510,9,0,larve,,,"I use 6 19&quot; monitors (using a combination of display port, HDMI, display link adapters). It&#x27;s a bit of a mess to set up, but I like the actual physical splitting of the monitors (I have the logfile monitor, the google chrome monitor, the firefox monitor, the jira monitor, the editor monitor, etc...). Also, it plays in very well with a tiling window manager where I can just switch windows from one monitor to the next without having to worry too much about tiling &quot;inside&quot; of a screen. On bigger than 19&quot; monitors, I find I can fit more than 2 windows side by side and then it becomes a weird game of rearranging windows.<p>I have been using this for 3+ years now, and while people always look at me like I&#x27;m crazy when setting up 6-7 monitors on my desk (I freelance so I usually lug them around or just buy a used set of monitors for a few bucks), I could <i>never</i> go back. Not switching windows, and using your peripheral vision for things like database load, or just plain having 2 editor monitors and 2 reference browsers open at the same time is invaluable.<p>While I can work on a single monitor, even a huge one (I love the 3k x 2k notebook resolutions), I feel cramped because I don&#x27;t have the physical separation that comes from the multiple monitors.",1389351543

Such a broad reading of &quot;value&quot; negates any limitation the word could imply. By the same token, we cannot accept Sheker&#x27;s suggestion that 18 U.S.C. 912 covers only things having commercial value. Information can be a thing of value. Whaley v. U. S., 324 F.2d 356 (9th Cir. 1963). In normal English usage commercial worth is not the exclusive measure of value. For instance, state secrets might trade hands without cash consideration. Information obtained for political advantage might have value apart from its worth in dollars. In each case the information sought would have value to others, in addition to the seeker. Such is the case here. Stokes would see value in keeping his whereabouts unknown to Sheker. The criminal justice system, concerned with the safety of witnesses, has a similar interest.<p>(In Whaley, Whaley impersonated an agent of the F.B.I and got information which he later paid paid $9, if I interpreted it correctly. Thus the information definitely has commercial value. In Sheker, the judge extends that to value other than commercial value.)<p>The information sought here is &quot;is Sell (or Sell&#x27;s company) willing to provide a back-door to the FBI?&quot; This is just after Sell stated publicly that the &quot;service wouldn&#x27;t have a backdoor for anyone.&quot;<p>I honestly can&#x27;t tell if this is a &quot;thing of value.&quot;<p>If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then I think that&#x27;s a thing of value. That information might be revealed later to embarrass or otherwise affect Sell&#x27;s company.<p>If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then there&#x27;s no value. The statement to the public is the same as the statement to the alleged impersonator.<p>Given the context, it seems very likely that most people would have expected Sell to say &quot;no.&quot; Thus, the overall value is very low.<p>It can&#x27;t be that asking a question where the answer isn&#x27;t already 100% known is illegal. The judge says that the law doesn&#x27;t &#x27;[extend] to anything that has value to the defendant&#x27;.<p>But I don&#x27;t know how that line is drawn.",1389351376

I just prefer looking straight ahead, managing a single screen, and clicking between the few programs I&#x27;m running in the taskbar. Also, I like some room on my desk, and big monitor displays just seem overwhelming.<p>You might (maybe, just saying what I like) want to try one &#x27;main&#x27; monitor and one subsidiary. Can be the same size or smaller. Main monitor is for the work you&#x27;re focussed on, the other monitor is where you have documentation or other reference material you need while working.

A single daemon process which manages windows, and all configuration is done with the shell via the `bspc` command, which talks to the daemon over a socket. A separate daemon (sxhkd) is used for keybindings, and the configuration for sxhkd is just a map of keybindings (including mouse buttons) to shell commands, with a very simple DSL to allow groups of commands, and the use of the cursor position. Example from my configuration:<p><pre><code>    alt + {Left,Down,Up,Right,h,j,k,l}\n        bspc window --focus {left,down,up,right,left,down,up,right}\n\n    {alt,super} + Tab\t\n        bspc {window,monitor} --focus next\n    \n    alt + super + {Left,Down,Up,Right}\n        bspc window --swap {left,down,up,right}\n\n    super + {Left,Down,Up,Right}\n        bspc window --edge {left,down,up,right} push\n    \n    super + shift + {Left,Down,Up,Right}\n        bspc window --edge {right,up,down,left} pull\n\n    super + q\n        bspc window --kill\n</code></pre>\nWorth noting that bspwm treats monitors individually when using window commands, so you need a separate set to handle windows on diff monitors (unless using Xinerama).<p>I&#x27;ve no idea whether it works on OSX though. 2bwm seems to be popular among OSX users, but I&#x27;ve not tried it.",1389349945

For a dunce like me, I can pretty much rely on people much smarter than me to review open sourced code. In reasonable time, if there is a iffy routine buried in some bit of software, such people will out it. So, people like me can pretty much trust it, and even if something is missed but later found, again, we can be sure the discoverer will report it, while a commercial organisation might be motivated to hide it.<p>But, how does that work with hardware? How do we trust all the chips? How do we know there isn&#x27;t something iffy built in at manufacture? Then, how can those same cleverer than me people discover it? How do they inspect the encased silicone circuit?<p>So, in that vein, I see the point you might have been making, and actually, I think its a worthwhile question.

A kind reading blames the <i>difference</i> on misogyny, suggesting the non-misogynists send death threats to males and females alike. But that would only be true if a large portion of the people that send death threats to females would do so out of misogyny and not out of, e.g., an unconscious perception of women as easier to troll. You may argue the reality of that perception and you may want to change that, but disagreeing with it doesn&#x27;t make it misogyny. That&#x27;s just labeling every bit of discriminatory behavior as &#x27;misogyny&#x27;, which comes down to redefining the term.<p>Apart from being wrong, I think it is unwise to use language so bluntly. It makes most readers think &quot;well, I&#x27;m not a misogynist, so nothing here applies to me&quot;, when the real thought should be &quot;yes, interesting, how likely am I to discriminate against women?

For example, consider the type<p><pre><code>  import qualified Data.Set as S\n\n  data SetM a where\n    SetAny ::            [a]     -> SetM a\n    SetOrd :: (Ord a) => S.Set a -> SetM a\n</code></pre>\nUsing your approach you can model this using ADTs and smart constructors as<p><pre><code>  data SetM a = SetAny [a] | SetOrd (S.Set a)\n\n  setAny :: [a] -> SetM a\n  setAny = SetAny\n\n  setOrd :: (Ord a) => S.Set a -> SetM a\n  setOrd = SetOrd\n</code></pre>\nBut that doesn&#x27;t give you everything you want. The whole point of defining SetM is to have a container that can statically propagate information about whether its elements are orderable. Using the ADTs + smart constructor approach you ensure that the SetOrd constructor only holds types that are orderable, but you have no way of telling the compiler that.",1389348190

I would say that you should start with Java first then you can learn the Android stuff. Thinking in Java is the book I always recommend (by Bruce Eckel); Android has a good tutorial on Google&#x27;s Android site, I think that is good for beginners. I have not read any books on Android but I am sure there are some good books on advanced topics if you are familiar with the basics. Start with some easy, small thing then you will learn the pieces with time.",1389348098

The total yearly cost for a programmer would have to exceed 666.666 $ to justify a 1000 $ purchase, if the improvement is only 0.05%.<p>That said, I agree.

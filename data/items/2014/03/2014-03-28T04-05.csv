The snow would muffle the noise of the city. Dusk would paint the sky in colours so exquisite that Judge could not begin to find names for them. The snow would reflect those hues. It would glow like the sky, and Judge would breathe in the cold air and hear his son breathing behind him, and he would feel as though together they had become part of winter itself.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been reading The Wisdom of Insecurity, and this is a central theme that Watts discusses - the idea of being separate and removed from nature.

With the exception of the UK, internal flights are a pleasure - simple metal detector, simple bag scan, and you&#x27;re on your way. The US approach by the TSA gets more onerous every year and accomplishes nothing.<p>Personally I think this is down to a certain inexperience the US has with terrorism. We still believe the world can be &quot;made safe&quot;. We believe that -reacting- to terrorism is warranted. (and of course everything is now a &quot; terrorist act&quot;)<p>Most other countries have lived with terrorist behavior for decades or longer. They learned that it is precisely by not reacting that you fight back. They learned that no, the world is not safe, and you can get killed in a car accident today, or struck by lightning tomorrow, or indeed just by riding a bicycle. (more people die on bicycles than by terrorism - and more people in the US every MONTH die in cars than were killed on Sept 11.)<p>The US currently has a teenager response to terrorism, and it will take years before they mature to where the rest of the world is already at. Until then, just like with any teenager, you have to let it work its course. The experience of others is seldom learned -experience doesn&#x27;t work like that.",1395982655

Surely, the behavior of children hasn&#x27;t changed much over the last few generations so how come this &quot;disease&quot; didn&#x27;t exist previous to the current couple of generations and how come it still doesn&#x27;t exist in many places on the planet? Could foreign kids somehow be better? Of course not. As the article points out, this is a ploy by pharmaceutical companies to get children hooked not only on ADHD drugs but on drugs in the future.<p>What do these kids do when they turn 18? I asked on pediatrician I respected what she does for the children. Does she taper them off? Does she transition them to other doctors? Does she transition them to other medicines? Nope. &quot;That&#x27;s not my problem,&quot; she said. Of course not. In a culture where doctors are not responsible, where making hundreds of dollars an hour is &quot;not enough&quot; to have them actually perform their duties in full, duties such as making a full investigation into their patients&#x27; cases, and spending more than 10 or 15 minutes before &quot;diagnosing&quot; them with a condition they do not have and putting them on drugs for essentially the rest of their lives, only in such a culture is ADHD real.<p>When it comes down to it, it&#x27;s the responsibility of the parents to keep their kids off drugs. The body doesn&#x27;t care wether you&#x27;re snorting amphetamine or Adderall because Adderall <i>is amphetamine.</i> Parents who allow their kids to be &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADHD and allow them to take drugs are encouraging their children to take drugs. They are unconscionable parents. Any child can make a mistake and start doing drugs, but now we have whole classes of drugs that are encouraged. Some drug abuse and addictions have become ingrained in life. Do you think the children will stop because they&#x27;ve now turned 18? Do you think they&#x27;ll stop at Ritalin or Adderall when those things stop working? Addiction knows no bounds.<p>How many more lives will have to be ruined before people realize the psychiatric industry and the doctors pushing these drugs are only doing it for the money, money they do not need? Talk about about scummy drug dealers. Yeah, we&#x27;re looking at the multi-billion dollar corporations, the &quot;psychiatrists,&quot; the DSM writers, and the rest of the doctors who can&#x27;t even be bothered to spend ten minutes with a patient before deciding on a horrific fate for them. When will people learn that the medical industry cannot be trusted, that the hippocratic oath is bullshit, and they need to be responsible for their own selves and their own children? Those parents allowing their kids to be put on this should be put in jail next to the child murderers they irresponsibly strive to be.",1395981845

A lot of the difference in how they decide what DOM changes are necessary.<p>React re-renders components when data changes and diffs the resulting JSDOM. The diff algorithm is fast and has simple hooks to make it faster by letting you compare state and component properties.<p>Blaze doesn&#x27;t diff the resulting DOM structure. Instead, Blaze diffs the data the components depend on. That data comes from reactive functions built on top of Deps, our dependency tracking system. When the component first renders, dependencies are tracked between data sources and rendered DOM elements (dependencies are automatically cleaned up when the component is taken off the page). Therefore when data changes, Blaze can directly update the relevant elements.<p>There is some overhead in Deps, our dependency tracking system, but Deps has been intentionally designed for supporting this efficiently (eg batching updates in a &quot;flush&quot; stage).<p>As for performance, our benchmarks have generally found that React outperforms Blaze when many elements change and Blaze outperforms React when few elements change (which is more common for typical operations on many web apps). We also have plans to improve performance on initial rendering.<p>There are some other difference worth noting: While a later version of Blaze will support easy APIs for re-useable components, React already has one. And the React component model is well-thought out, complete and in production use whereas the Blaze component model at the moment is only the implementation behind templates.<p>Happy to hear any other perspectives.",1395980338

That is after a 208.7% growth between 2000 and 2007.<p>- Africa, with three times the population of North America, has a mere 3.6% of its population online. That is after a 638.4% growth between 2000-2007.<p>- Asia, the largest region with 3.7 billion people, has merely 10.7% of the people on the Internet. That is after a 248.8% growth between 2000-2007.

8643,comment,6668,8142,0,0,jayliew,,,"That's a very good point, Daniel .. thanks :)<p>It is true -- sometimes I get that feeling that I beat my up unnecessarily for no real reason, and get miserable. Then, it takes someone else (like my mentor), to point to me all the things I did right, which makes me go ""oh yeah .."", I'm not a that dumb after all. HEH.<p>But you know what, if there's one thing I've learned from my previous job -- working in a team where I am the smartest person on board, IS NOT APPEALING to me. I specifically told my current boss, during the interview, that I _don't_ want to be the smartest guy on the team.<p>So basically its an infinite loop:<p>1. don't want to be the smartest person on the team<p>2. play catch up<p>3. go to (1)<p>So in all that three steps, the standard I set for myself is always higher and I never appear to have ""met"" my standards. Just like you said.<p>LOL<p>:)",1175644807

I wasn't there at the time, but I imagine that only a fraction of the people at the time understood the revolutionary capabilities of this technology, while most were indifferent, and perhaps, like you, a little annoyed if the WWW was repeatedly mentioned to you in a short timespan.<p>Of course we all know how significant the WWW turned out to be to human society in the next decade and later.<p>Well, IMHO, what is happening today in 2011 with Bitcoin is the same thing. When I first read about Bitcoin, I skimmed over it, thought it was a scam. Then it was mentioned to me again, and again, became curious, stumbled upon the white paper by accident (<a href=""http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>), read it, and was amazed by the concepts, the design, the suprising capabilities offered by its clever use of cryptography. This is so different and so far ahead from any monetary system that exists today that I, for one, believe that Bitcoin is potentially as revolutionary as the WWW. The very fact we see so many submissions from <i>different people</i> about Bitcoin (the top 8 submission at <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=+site:ycombinator.com+bitcoin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=+site:ycombinator.com+bitcoin</a> are from 7 different HN accounts, so it is not like there is a core group of fanboys spamming HN), and the fact that HN is a community with a high concentration of smart folks, shows that Bitcoin is certainly onto something...

2492151,comment,2490457,2491310,5,0,nitrogen,,,"I see two troublesome arguments here that are often used by the media industries:<p>1. ""It's those @$#% kids!""  In other words, promulgating and perpetuating an unnecessary generational divide.  The ""entitlement generation"" will soon enough be running the show, so the incumbents are only doing humanity a disservice by taking a scorched-earth-like policy instead of figuring out how to run a sustainable business that satisfies the demands of the technology-enabled consumer.<p>2. ""Pirates gonna pirate.""  There is no ""pirate"" demographic, no one reason why people copy instead of buying.  Maybe they've watched the first season of a show on Hulu, but the later seasons are unavailable.  Maybe they'll pay for content <i>or</i> watch ads, but not both at the same time (Hulu).  Maybe they missed an episode of their favorite show and don't want to wait 30 days to a year for it to show up on Hulu/Netflix/DVD.<p>Assuming that all pirates are of equally dubious moral character is defeatist, elitist, and self-damaging.  It's defeatist and self-damaging because it's ignoring the potential to expand one's market to reach some of the pirates.  Each incremental step out of the inglorious dark ages of big media and into the digital light will capture another <i>n</i>% of the currently-pirate market.  It's elitist because it regards having a different moral code as inferior, when in reality, it's just different.<p>This addresses your second-to-last paragraph.  Pandora is a pain because it's deliberately crippled.  If you get a mix you don't like, you can only downvote or skip a few songs before you're forced to listen to whatever they play, and that restriction applies across all of your stations.  In other cases, it's a deficiency of marketing/awareness/trust, user interface, selection, ISP bandwidth/throttling, or pricing.<p>Finally, give it time.  The typical college graduate has probably ""acquired"" more music over the past 7 years of their lives than they could ever have hoped to pay for.  Some of those will eventually convert to paying customers as they begin earning real money, and their increased access to creative content during school may have inspired them to greater societal contributions, from which all of us can benefit.",1303965041

The problem is that it has no variety, and you will get extremely sick of eating the same meal continuously over and over again.<p>There are many ways to eat slow carb without strictly following the 4HB diet.  For example, Tim Ferris says to stay away from anything that is ""white, or can be made to be white.""  He's talking mostly about wheat, flour, and pasta, but also includes brown rice.  Brown rice is an excellent slow carb so it shouldn't be excluded.  There are a lot of great grains that are slow carbs like buckwheat, quinoa, wild rice, steel cut oats, etc, that won't make you gain weight and are good balanced carbs.<p>My experience is that you can do the 4HB diet for a month or two and lose some weight, but think about it - do you want to eat beans every meal for the rest of your life?  It's not a sustainable diet that you can stick with for a long time, and that's what matters.  In the end, you need a healthy diet that you can stick with for an extended period of time, or you're just going to gain the weight back.<p>Stick with slow carbs (all the ones I mentioned above), nuts, fruits, vegetables, eggs, and lean meats, and you'll be fine.  Stay away from fast carbs, sugars, and foods with a high glycemic index and get some variety in your diet.  Eat breakfast every day with protein in it.<p>Another thing that doesn't work with Tim Ferris' diet is the ""no fruit"" rule.  Fruit is not that bad.  Most fruit has a low glycemic index, although some like watermelon is not that good for you (high GI).  Completely excluding any fruit from your diet is probably not healthy long term.",1303964109

I do think you could've got your point across as easily without naming names though, or scrubbing the email to protect the ""innocent"".<p>Since you did name names, I doubt any amount of compliments would avoid leaving a bad taste.<p>As far as the message, maybe I'm just in a funny mood, but it strikes me as a great balance, and while I mentally get less excited about a project whenever I see ""MySQL"", it is probably about the nicest I've seen.<p>In an attempt to be on topic though: If we're going to critique mailers like this, targeting the ones with the extensive Qualifications/Requirements list from recruiters to be allowed to work with their client's run-of-the-mill app seems fair enough.<p>Here's one of my recent ones:<p><pre><code>  Qualified candidates will possess the following skills and experience:\n\n  *   A proven background in Ruby on Rails design and development\n  *   Expertise in MVC architecture and design\n  *   Experience in MySQL RDBMS\n  *   Test Driven and Agile Development experience\n  *   If you have experience with other languages (e.g. PHP, Python, Objective-C), frameworks, multimedia, etc. all the better.</quote>\n</code></pre>\nOk, so Rails+MySQL is about as vanilla as it gets in my book. MVC architecture and design though? Seriously, you can count the number of Rails developers who've put any thought whatsoever into that on one hand. In Rails it just ""is"". You don't think about it. Compare to <a href=""http://codebetter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codebetter.com/</a>. <i>Years</i> after I left .NET and stopped following the blog yet these guys are still talking about fundamentals of OOAD in-depth, and exploring testability with an output from just this one multi-blog that probably equals every Ruby blogger ever. ;-) I mean, if you rule out the blogging about how you should use the latest vegetable themed testing framework that business people are going to use to drive requirements and change the world anyways.<p>When I see ""Agile Development"" in a job pitch I automatically think ""cowboys without a plan"" these days. If you have flexible scope and/or deadlines driven by client collaboration and/or goal-oriented operations, make sure that's clear if you're going to mention the ""A""-word. Without expanding on your process using the ""Agile"" phrase just comes off as shifting responsibility to developers to get it right without due-diligence from the business side. And when it's not right, or the requirements or goals are not well understood, it's typically going to be the Developer making up the difference by putting in extra hours to compensate for the lack of planning, with no realistic expectation of renumeration for his/her time.<p>And again, I probably should know more about MySQL. I never did master it. After making the switch to PostgreSQL I managed to drastically reduce the effort required to get complex queries to perform as I'd expect a modern RDBMS should (my previous experience being with MSSQL, which other than portability issues is really an outstanding product in my book, really the only MS product I'm a fan of) and didn't look back. That's my own hangup based on my own personal experience though I suppose. It's probably not fair to mark down a mental demerit for it. I do anyways. ;-)",1303963560

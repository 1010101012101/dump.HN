47418,comment,46971,47357,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That entry is under ""Government Type"", not under ""Economy"".  The relevant passage from the Economy section is ""China's economy during the last quarter century has changed from a centrally planned system that was largely closed to international trade to a more market-oriented economy that has a rapidly growing private sector and is a major player in the global economy.""<p>This may be confusing, because communism is both a political and an economic system.  China could best be described as a one-party communist <i>state</i> with a free-market capitalist <i>economy</i>.  However, the article is the economy, not the government.  These complaints wouldn't be an issue if China was really Communist - the recent uproar has been about a <i>lack</i> of government regulation in product manufacturer, while a truly communist government would manufacturer all the goods itself.",1188308901

Hers is pretty refreshing, but in order to achieve those effects, she used a lot of unorthodox methods.  <p>I don't know if it's some sort of layout software that's doing it, or she did it by hand, but it's a lot of absolute positioning.<p>I still think very page-like and being semantically correct when it comes to my layouts.  Her methods gives me something else to think about.  In addition, if her page source is any indication, CSS and HTML is nowhere near the expressibility that is required for complicated layouts.  If it were, her source would be more semantically valid, and she wouldn't be using divs for the buildings and all the little windows in the upper right corner.<p>",1188308377

47407,comment,47232,47250,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"Thank you everyone for your support. After posting this and answering 2 comments, I turned off my laptop and went to sleep. I didn't do sleep right away. My girlfriend told me everything ( well according to her ) and what was in her heart. I didn't really like what I heard, but at least I felt free. Now that I think about it, maybe it isn't that bad a little bit. When feelings are involved everything doubles up. We are now on the same page and it is better to get out now than latter. The car, the phone I will replace. It is ok. I start realizing that maybe  not being connected is not that bad. I think I am not going to replace the push-email enabled phone for a while and enjoy my new found freedom. 
The job, I don't care.  I am happy now. I can concentrate on my startup and I have been doing some consulting ( self proclaim consultant )work, but I was scared to go at it full time. Now, that is what I am doing and at least I enjoy it. <p>Thank you guys. Maybe I will never see all of you in real life, but you have made me feel better. Everyone needs someone. And sometimes that someone, or ""those people"" are the ones you argue with online, the ones who don't have a name but a username, the ones who take a moment away from their precious time and support you through hard times.
Thank you all. ",1188307689

Using the mass in a galaxy to make a computer where the logic is on the atomic scale...<p>10^9 stars, each with 10^57 atoms. The logic of the post is that a group of 10^7 nuerons can have a thought, and there are 10^70000000000 ways to group them. But there are 10^59 groups of this size, each operating independently, which implies 10^(7*10^69) states in a galactic brain#, but let's call it 10^10^70 to be neat and account for dark matter in the galaxy :).<p>There are around 125 billions galaxies in the universe.

47397,comment,47310,47338,0,0,rickcecil,,,"I would say that it wasn't Google's design that beat Yahoo, it was the narrow focus on search. There is very little information to design on the Google home page and the expected interaction is incredibly simplistic, so designing the UI well should have been easy. <p>The problem is that most people see Google as a great example of engineers doing design, but there was really /nothing/ to design. If an engineer managed to screw a single search field up, then that's just bad. (And, I have known engineers who've screwed up simple search fields.)<p>My recommended guideline here: as information increases in density and interaction increases in complexity, the need to have someone focus on design increases. Now, is this person a bona fide designer or one of the engineers that has some design skill? That's for the individual startup to determine.",1188306614

We live in a very, very quiet suburb with large properties, there is only local trafic and nothing else. So it was possible for me to visualise the solution to a problem into the dark in front of me (like an internal blackboard). Many times I came home after about an hour with a happy dog and a way to solve the problem or at least a great way to it. I just had to make some short note of it to pick it up next morning, the note releasing all saved information in my brain. Worked a treat for me.

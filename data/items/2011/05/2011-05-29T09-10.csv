2596351,comment,2592399,2596321,0,0,saurik,,,"This argument also never makes sense to me: I have never demanded that the Python developers change this mentality, I do not complain on their mailing lists, nor do I storm into their IRC servers demanding that they change either. And I certainly don't send them text messages at all times of the day, like thr users of my app do to me ;P.)<p>Instead, when there are discussions on business-oriented sites like Hacker News about what investing in technologies (like Google APIs, in this case), I make certain that people don't make flawed arguments about the cost tradeoffs involved in maintaining your own dependency chain, and it turns out that Python 2/3 is a great example of this (and one I didn't even bring up).<p>Unfortunately, bringing up personal stories of this tradeoff is going to come off as ""whining"", as you call it, to some people, but frankly that just comes off, to mr, as name calling. I think the Python 2/3 split is a great example of a particular area of quicksand that a smart businessman (which I apparently wasn't, I will add) will avoid, and I think that is an interesting idea to keep in mind (""what is the percentage chance that I will have to maintain this thing that is not my core business myself after a few years"") whenever adopting a technology, new or old.",1306663089

2596349,comment,2595680,2596007,1,0,dexen,,,"<i>> if military tech were developed with ""Open Hardware"" goals in mind</i><p>Not going to happen. Military hardware is (most of the time) cutting-edge technology. If we are talking about a fighter plane, most of its components have to exhibit high performance overall -- and in small package. The abilities of the plane hinge on every component and their co-operation as well; the weakest link is the limiting factor.<p>Each military technology has two aspects: instances of use (for lack of better word), and capability.<p>Consider encryption for a moment:  an algorithm of any size and complexity is driven by a small key (a bunch of bytes). The small secret part (key) is enough to to keep each use instance (each encoded text) safe.<p>However, in case of military hardware, the capability itself is of paramount importance as well. You can't focus all the aspects of fighter plane in one `key' piece; each component has to provide some aspect of the capability -- and withstand results of use of other components, such as heat, acceleration, vibration etc. Since no `key' is possible to hardware, you have to guard whatever else is there to guard -- and that, unfortunately, is most of the pieces.<p>Nb., a lot of military standards [1] are commercially-accessible, to help build a healthy ecosystem of suppliers. But those are not cuttind-edge stuff; I don't think even the formula for SR-71's `JP-7' fuel was accessible during operational use of the plane...<p>----<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._military_standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._military_standard</a>",1306662554

Bitcoin does this although I'd say it's a side-effect rather than a feature and you have to accept a whole lot of baggage. Applying this to money would be clever. I haven't thought it all the way through but it feels like you'd get tripped up by the fungibility of money. If I use some of my tainted dollars to get a loan and then use those loaned dollars to buy something from you, haven't I bypassed your filter? (As long as they guy making the loan doesn't mind getting paid with tainted dollars.) You could try to make the loan provider tag their loaned dollars with the tag of the payment, but I'm not sure how you'd enforce it. Not to mention that fractional reserve banking means that ""new"" dollars are being created and destroyed all the time. Still it's an interesting idea and bears further thought.",1306662066

By conducting an interview online, you can (for example) have him code the solution to a problem in real-time, how he thinks about it etc. So much more efficient than phone interviews, and a much better predictor for candidate quality.<p>3- a service to outsource video making for webapps. people making webapps often need demos of their products, but would rather not spend valuable time learning how to make a video, voiceover etc.<p>There would be a lot more.

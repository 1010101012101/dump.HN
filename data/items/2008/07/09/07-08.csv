240900,comment,240389,240495,0,0,neilk,,,"1. Because they are a business and there is also profit in exploiting existing markets.<p>2. Even if you ask an engineer what his or her dream product is, it's often something like ""(existing thing) done right"".<p>3. How do you know that your other examples won't turn out to be as innovative? It took Google years to figure out search advertising. You just <i>think</i> that Google miraculously produced perfect software the first time around, because you weren't paying as much attention before.<p>But I will grant you one point. The old Google had a rule that they wouldn't get into a market unless they thought they had a chance of being 10x better than anyone else. It's hard to believe that Lively is going to be 10x better than the other social MMOs.",1215589728

240898,comment,240814,240814,0,0,bilch,,,"This is journalism so bad it makes me sympathize with Reiser. No, you don't lie to the people you interview, and no, the fact that someone murdered his wife does not make it okay to lie to them, either. And when people ""read what was written and their reflection punches them in the face"", most of the time it isn't ""their reflection"" that punches them in the face so much as the journalist's bad work. Which is exactly why every interviewee should ask to see the manuscript before it's published, and if the journalist tells you ""it doesn't work that way"", don't consent to the interview.",1215589392
240897,comment,240081,240081,0,0,trotzke,,,"I think the premise of the article is misguided. If they need time tracking with accounting software integration, have they tried Harvest?<p>Linda sounds like the problem not basecamp. If Linda was doing a good job she would have researched problem and turned up Harvest-- at least as an option to try.<p>Instead she fell into the 'this is the way it's been done before mindset', that doesn't recognize the benefits of collaboration or web services.<p>In my experience, Linda's approach may make her feel like every penny is accounted for, but that will only be true in her books. Everyone else will be left with a print out of a week old, outdated gantt chart, and less certainty about what to do.",1215589200
240896,comment,240325,240525,0,0,Tichy,,,"Why? I regret never having worked at a coffee shop. Now I am over 30 it doesn't feel so appropriate anymore, and I am spoiled by the IT money. But sometimes I still feel like just working in a coffee shop. Only for a while of course, the money just isn't good enough. But if it leaves you with enough energy to code on the side, it might be OK.<p>Also, the experience might come in handy if you ever want to open your own cafe later in life...",1215589118
240893,comment,240750,240750,0,0,warwick,,,"If given a choice, I prefer to work on one thing to the exclusion of all other things.<p>It takes me a day or two to really get into a project.  Once I'm there, I find that I naturally cycle my focus between projects every three to four weeks.  My biggest challenge to getting things done is the day when I finish off a project cycle and try to figure out what to work on next.  If I don't have a clear idea, I flit between a half dozen or so potential projects until I dig my teeth into one.<p>I also to have 'little projects' on the side burner to work on for a couple hours if I'm feeling the need for a break without full-on switching into another project.  These little projects tend to be things like 'learn how to do this in framework X' or 'write up a blog entry for sample code Y'.<p>It's worth noting that I work predominantly on desktop software, so I'm used to a longer release cycle than a lot of people here.",1215588783

I'm curious what the numbers are. For all Apple's ads bash Vista for incompatibilities, the vast majority of software and some huge percentage of hardware is Windows only.<p>That seems to be the only advantage MS has left, they should use it.",1215587076

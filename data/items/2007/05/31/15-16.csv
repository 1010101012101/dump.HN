My key takeaway was its going to take longer than you thought.\nAnd don't underestimate the legal/admin costs and time.\nNot sure why they need 3,200 sq ft. of class A office space, they obviously have a big vision that investors are jazzed about",1180626799

There are a number of things someone can do to speed/ or tweek the way that data is accessed.  From what I have seen about the web.<p>You want to design your functions in such a way that you are not doing anything complicated at first.  This means that you should focus your API, webservice, or website around operations that perform a single DB call, and are linear in their search time, sometimes page-ation can help too.  If you have an api that, for instance tries to find friends of friends, you are opening yourself up to disaster if you are going to do that in real time for a web service.  You would be better off offering a service that gives you the friends of a user, pending you have the rights to see that users friends.<p>Something else we discovered was that if you are using MySQL on a different box in the cloud, your data access times are going to be SLOW, but if you have the DB running on a machine connected through a 1Gb connection you might be alright, but if you have MySQL running on the same dedicated box, then DB calls are almost as fast a calls to memory.  Especially if you set up your db connection to connect through some sort of piped call or something similar in linux.  At that point your call avoids going through your network interface and you skip the TCP/IP stack, which is a huge latency boost.",1180626727

So what are you waiting for? Checking them out can't hurt anything.",1180625999
25680,comment,25503,25506,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""MVC takes a little while to wrap your brain around if you've only ever done things like PHP.""<p>Good PHP code typically uses a MVC architecture as well.  The model is the database, the controller consists of PHP files that take your $_GET and $_POST parameters and grab result sets out of the database, and the view is PHP files with no PHP tags besides your basic echoing, looping, and conditional HTML inclusion.  Some people prefer to use a templating system like Smarty, which gives a prettier syntax but is conceptually the same.<p>Good examples are vBulletin, Phorum, and Pligg (well, the Pligg codebase has some other issues, but it's a MVC architecture).  Bad examples might be stuff like PhotoPost that mashes all the code together.  I highly suspect successful PHP websites like Flickr and FaceBook use a MVC architecture too, but I have no inside knowledge of their codebase.<p>Rails isn't that hard to learn if you've seen PHP code written like that.  A Rails controller is like a collection of PHP entry pages: each method responds to a particular URL, and is responsible for populating dynamic content and rendering a template (which implicitly defaults to the method name).  An ERB template is just like a PHP page, but with embedded Ruby instead of embedded PHP.  An ActiveRecord object is like a PHP result set, except that changes to the object can be easily reflected back to the database.  That's basically Rails in a nutshell.",1180625732

It's perfect for straightening out the last few deployment issues and seeing if we can get traction before investing a lot in the site, though.  We've got full root access to the box.",1180623874

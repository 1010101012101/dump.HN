1660671,comment,1659364,1659364,0,0,chadmalik,,,"I think what he is saying make sense. For instance there is a huge mountain of evidence for anthropogenic global warming and the need to cut down our emissions. I'd say on 9/10 things I probably agree with the scientists, with the exception of GMO foods which to me are a really bad idea with potentially catastrophic consequences.<p>However, I have a problem with laymen needing to sit down and accept whatever scientists say for the simple fact that science is not some pristine incorruptible institution dedicated only to truth.  Scientists are PEOPLE and are subject to the same political issues, careerism, bias to not make funders angry, etc. that everyone else is.<p>Science is subject to a lot of influence from the people holding the purse strings, which are often industry.  Take the recent story that came out of Harvard Medical School about how pharma has been influencing the ways that drugs are being prescribed: <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-co...</a> - should we non-scientists not question scientists, physicians, and other ""authorities"" when this type of thing is happening?<p>It is a GOOD thing when people question what scientists say.  What is needed are better ways for scientists and non-scientists to engage in dialogue, and more often.  Believe it ot not there might be a few things scientists can learn from the non-scientists.<p>I think that a lot of this gets discussed by regular people on broadcast channels (talk radio, cable news) that are really terrible mediums for communicating complex ideas.  It would be nice if TV and radio weren't so cluttered with advertising, which makes it almost impossible to do more than make short statements.  The exceptions that are good for communiating ideas through broadcast (such as Michio Kaku's radio show) prove the rule by being commercial-free.<p>Another note, scientists have to understand how political discourse and beliefs work.  The domain is NOT based on rational inquiry and peer review.  There is no ""correct answer"" as to whether Social Security should be privatized or if the US should withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.  The work of George Lakoff is a must-read on this topic; we form much of our political beliefs based on non-rational moral frameworks that stem from our childhood and our ideas about the family (strict father vs. nurturant parent morality), and mapping our ideas about how the family should work onto the ""nation as family"" morality.",1283540323

It was done in the fury of initial Facebook apps which were land grabs -- no real sense of what the data'd be used for, but with a sense that a footprint in that space would be valuable.  Also it turns out that a with a finely tuned UI, people <i>love</i> to put pins on maps!  It taps into some baseline lower-reptilian instinct, which explains our consistent 8 million monthly users.<p>Fast-forward about 3 years and we've got about a <i>billion</i> pins worth of data.  Enough data that it's the single most painful table to deal with!  And our CEO comes up with what to do with them: use them to identify which of your friends can help you plan your trip.  As aside, TA is so profitable that we can worry about making your experience better rather than using sleazy tactics to just keep you on the site.<p>After about three months worth of work, our small team built a Facebook Connect implementation that taps into the data we've got in pins and ties it together into a clean UI that people love. It's simple, barely needs explanation, and just plains works.<p>If you're the sort of person who might want to be part of this sort of thing (large datasets, great UIs, big ideas, small teams), please drop me a line: sanj@tripadvisor.com",1283540287

They are outgoing and already willing to meet with strangers.<p>I don't want to add a whole new social network layer and wish there were a good way to let people provide a link to their online identity, like thier facebook profile, meetup profile etc. But it's a pretty big hurdle to get someone to know what a link to their facebook profile is never mind copy and paste it somewhere.<p>Doesn't foursquare cover that ground though?

When the star goes through the red giant phase, the oceans are boiled off and blown off into space along with some microbes.  The microbes move from star to star through space, and seed new planets around new stars.  You'd expect to see them as dust in interstellar space if this was happening.

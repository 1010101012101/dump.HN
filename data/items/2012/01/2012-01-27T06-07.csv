Integers and decimals are both stored as 8 bytes. So one record takes 42 bytes. After compression it takes about 8 bytes ( I use FOR - frame of reference) compression and it works really well with decimal numbers (check the range of decimal numbers in lineitem.tbl file - usually you encode them in just a few bits). So I can stream about 10 million records per second from my disk. Which makes it exactly 180 seconds for 1.8B rows ( CUDA calculations are done in the background process).
Records are decompressed in GPU and processed there.
Actually the main bottleneck is not the disk access but the latency of CUDA calls - each call takes about 15 ms and when you process the entire file in chunks of ,say, 6 million records, it really adds up.",1327647056

Students are usually turned off because a good take-home is really, really hard. What this professor did was give you the exam, mark incorrect problems, and then if the class average was poor, give you a second copy. You would turn the second copy in a few days later, and you would get some fraction of the credit for any improvement in your score. (Say you got a 60 the first time and an 80 the second time, you might end with a 65-70)<p>The result was that, after being challenged by difficult problems that require your complete focus, you are given some feedback on what you got wrong, at which point you go back to the book to work out what the real answer is. That revision step is key; the promise of some recovery points is mostly just motivation to take it seriously<p>I felt like those exams were huge learning experiences. The caveats are: it is more work for the professor; this was an upper division course, so students were serious and the class size was small; the best problems are hard and open ended.",1327646562

Put it on an elevated track, and that property value change goes the other way (noise, visual pollution, loss of sunlight).  OK, so put it in the middle of the street.  If it's a dedicated lane, not only do you suck up space from the cars, you have to figure out how to squeeze in platforms, and the light rail has to stop at both platforms and intersections making it painfully slow (take the Boston green lines as an example).  If it isn't a dedicated lane, it's a streetcar and you have cars constantly squeezing around it and everybody has to stop to let people run into the middle of the street to get on, plus the odd traffic patterns created at every intersection (Toronto).<p>If you have the space for a dedicated right-of-way you might as well go full out and make high-cap rail.  Otherwise, I see light rail as the worst compromise in-between subways and buses.  There's a reason Manhattan has essentially eliminated all at-grade light rail, and elevated rail still exists only in the relatively poor neighborhoods: wherever the subway doesn't run, buses are best at filling the gap without destroying the street-level environment.",1327644210

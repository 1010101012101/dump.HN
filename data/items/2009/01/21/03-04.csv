442762,comment,442352,442670,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but today's Ubuntu systems <i>do</i> come installed with OO, and even if not, it's not like it's difficult to acquire when the user grasps <i>only</i> the fundamentals of the package system(two or three navigating moves, a search entry, and one or two clicks), which is fully available with more applications than one has time in their lifespan to go through let alone actually use. :) But alas, the problem I think with OO, at least in my experience, is that OO is like a one way function- it accepts .doc formats but it's not /completely/ compatible the other way around- going to a purely Win Office(Word) world. I've noticed simple discrepancies after saving in OO and then opening in Word that I didn't particularly care for. However, the most full-circle solution that I found to that was(possibly an advanced topic for this student), is to open up something like VMWare Player or Workstation and there's your glorified Windows Office.<p>What urks me about these schools is that they're not as informed as they're supposed to be. Making such stringent requirements such as those are just plain moronic.

You have too many categories for too few posts at the moment. The search bar seems awkward in the center. Ditto the RSS.<p>There is no organization. No reason why you have games or widgets on your site if it's a blog. If it's not a blog stop making it look like one.<p>Your registration page is thin, narrow, and long. Consider multiple columns. Also consider explaining what you are more concisely, and in a better format on the site than a mere About page.<p>Why is the box on the bottom gray? Why is there no space between ""notes"" and ""is"" in that box?<p>""Student Body"" should be ""Users,"" and I don't know why you list a user directory in the first place. Is this a forum? Then make it look like one. Is it an isolated network of separate schools? No need for a user directory. In any case, don't make people guess what the links are. I did that with the first forum I built, and the lesson I got might help you: if you're trying to distinguish features with names because they're the same features you can find anywhere else, it means that you need new features.<p>You need a lot of formatting. Like, a <i>lot</i>. This is ugly. Add breaks between paragraphs, remove the Share button unless you can customize it to look like something else.<p>Am I correct in assuming the Add Schools form is just a disguised Contact form? And the ""Powered by Knowledge"" is just a disguised ""Powered by Wordpress?""<p>It looks like this is one of your first efforts to make a site, if I'm not mistaken. In that case, could I give you some advice? First off, try experimenting with other management systems, not Wordpress. Try them all. Look for ""groups"" functionality in each of them. That's the best way to implement a school system. I think Plone and Joomla have them. (Drupal's Organic Groups module runs far too slowly for a production-level environment.)<p>I was in the same situation as you, a few years ago, and I was trying something similarly ambitious. It's easier to start with something small, but if you want to go for ambitious, you'll need to learn how to code manually. Get a good FTP editor. Get a good visual CSS editor. Start opening up files in CMS's and learning how things are done. Look at the hacks you install (modules, plugins, whatever) and see what their code's doing. Try and get a visual feel for how it should work, and try tweaking things.<p>The thing is, PHP is really simple. If you want to code a Groups implementation by hand, you probably could in about a month even if you know no PHP at the moment. (Some people will disagree, but take a few good tutorials and mash them up and you can almost certainly get things exactly how you want them to be, even when you're starting off.) Styling a web site takes CSS: if you have a visual editor, it suddenly becomes a matter of just learning what looks good and then learning how to reproduce it. Smashing Magazine is a godsend. Avoid A List Apart at first: it'll seem scary and complicated when you're first starting. Smashing Magazine organizes itself in ways like ""10 CSS Hacks To Make A Nice Registration Form"" which is really nice. And again, this might be unpopular on this site, but keep messing with CMS's. They don't work for everything, but they handle the simple stuff so you can add on top and mess around and get a feel for coding.<p>As for your site concept itself: you need to figure out how to <i>inform</i> teachers and staff about your site, and to <i>reward</i> them for participating. In planning my site, which will eventually market to teachers, I worked with a few teachers from my school. And teachers are apathetic. Some barely know what a computer is. Some don't care about interacting with students. You need to figure out how to make <i>them</i> want to use your service, and that's extraordinarily difficult. They're apathetic and hard to reach and will make any excuse they need to make if it means them not having to learn a new service. So you'll have to simplify as well.<p>Hopefully that helps! If you've got any questions either respond to me or drop an email. Best of luck in the future!",1232508332

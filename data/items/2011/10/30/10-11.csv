3174064,comment,3172335,3173116,2,0,alinajaf,,,">  If you ask most people what stopped them from reading their entire programming book (and weve talked to hundreds of people), its almost always that they arent motivated enough. In school, learning is motivated by report cards and teacher expectations. We hope we can build a motivational experience that pushes anyone to program - not just the stereotypical developer.<p>Badges and achievements are awesome when done right, but will only go so far with motivation.  Real, intrinsic motivation will come from realizing that you can create something with the skills you've learned. If you could somehow capture this in Codecademy I think you could score a decisive advantage against the traditional tutorial/book learning model of learning to program.<p>Context: I'm currently working on a spaced repetition app that schedules Japanese vocab/sentence flashcards for you. While it has achievements/badges for behaviour that's conducive to your Japanese learning, it also finds native content on the internet that you're likely going to be able to read 90% of (based on the vocab cards you've done well on). Realizing that you can actually read Japanese content for native Japanese (i.e. you can actually _use_ the skill you're learning here) is the biggest rush of motivation I've experienced. It pushes you to go on and see how much more you could do, way more than any badge or achievement could.",1319971289

3174048,comment,3173560,3173781,13,0,wolf550e,,,"It seems to me that people think monitoring means ""in real time"". It does not. It just means ""recording"". The government records (or it would if it had the money) all telephone conversations. It does not listen to them nor index them nor transcribe them nor even scan them for keywords. It just records. From any number to any number. All the time. The tapes are kept indefinitely. If someone becomes a suspect in something, all phone conversations he was party to can be played back, either by humans or a computer that can transcribe, cross-index, identify other people by their voice, etc., whatever the technology permits. Same for all IP packets, if they had the budget.<p>When they have a lead or reason to find something about you, e.g. you work for the minority party or are an actual dissident or slept with a cop's ex-wife, they comb through everything and find something you did that may not even be illegal but would be embarrassing.<p>No humans need to be involved in storing the voice data on tape, and automatic transcription and cross-indexing only ever needs to be performed for a few phone numbers which are under investigation. But once someone becomes a suspect, all his history can be played back in order to, for example, discover his accomplices.<p>There are scenarios which demonstrate how this can be useful and can save lives. I imagine these scenarios were used by the fascists to get the government to allow this. It goes like this: In a system in which wiretapping is only allowed by court order after law enforcement has probable cause, wiretapping a suspect's phone could be too late - he's either dead (law enforcement first got interested in him after discovering his body) or learned enough to not talk about his activity on the phone. But back when he was getting started he made mistakes. With conversations recorded before law enforcement ever heard of him, those mistakes can be exploited.",1319970621

3174046,comment,3173993,3173993,6,0,jacques_chester,,,"As usual, it depends on what you define as a ""transaction"".<p>If you don't need ACID, I can probably jerry-rig something in C that'll give you hundreds of thousands of ""transactions"" per second. It may have problems with retrieving the data, but hey, look at that sucker go!<p>OK. Time to be more reasonable.<p>1. Relaxed Guarantees<p>There's no actual durability in the conventional spinning-rust sense. Instead you're hoping that a fleet of identical instances all receive the same event objects in the same order. If they don't, you're going to have mysterious problems when some of the systems get out of sync.<p>According to fowler, business transactions are broken into events which are processed individually. This essentially means that some transactions aren't atomic. LMAX can credit  A and fail to debit B because the bits are done independently.<p>Consistency is palmed off to the input queues.<p>2. Smart data structures<p>They profiled the code and found places where they could swap out standard Java collections for their own problem-specific variants.<p>What they refer to as ""Disruptors"" are smart ring buffers; or as they are sometimes called, ""Queues"". I realise that this is not as cool-sounding as ""Disruptor"" (they should have called the ""Business Logic Processor"" the ""Phaser""!), but it seems to more or less describe the interface, which is that things go in a given order and come out in approximately that order.<p>Actually, it's possible I've misunderstood how that structure works. It might also be that the system is skipping over elements that aren't yet ready, in which case this looks more like an active priority queue, interface-wise.<p>3. Conclusion<p>Impressive work from the LMAX team. But let's remember to keep stuff in perspective. It has always been the case that ACID exacts a high toll on performance. To the extent that you relaxed it you could always go faster.<p>Too often we in our industry see the shiny big performance number and forget that it isn't free.

It has the same amount of RAM and the CPU might be a bit better.<p>iPods are released yearly so there is no reason why they shouldn’t be just as fast and have just as much RAM as iPhones. It’s right, though, that the oldest iPod touch (from 2007) won’t get the update. 2nd and 3rd generation iPod touches will but 2nd generation iPod touches won’t get multitasking (just like their brother, the 2nd generation iPhone aka iPhone 3G).",1274615538

1372147,comment,1372082,1372082,0,0,Tichy,,,"Getting emotional because of a movie is a very bad idea. It is very unlikely that a movie gives you a well rounded perspective on a subject, and much more likely that it will manipulate you and make you emotional.<p>If in the end it was the home owners who shouldn't have bought homes that caused the collapse, what could the likely regulation be? Seems to me ultimately it would be ""people must be protected against themselves"", that is, it would be a patronizing regulation that would assume that people in general are too stupid to take care for themselves. In turn, this would take away the capability for people to make decisions for themselves. In short, now maybe too many people owned homes, then too few people would own homes.<p>Personally I think that any regulation that pretends to know better what is good for people than the people themselves is flawed on principle.<p>What should of course be illegal (and probably already is) is fraud. Telling people they can afford something they can't afford could be fraud, to be decided on a case-by-case basis.<p>The really scandal to me is that they don't seem to teach anything at all about personal finances in school - at least in Germany they didn't. I guess it is just not a prerequisite or even counterproductive to making you a docile, useful worker.",1274615235

1372144,comment,1371286,1371286,0,0,plq,,,"ddg is quite nice when you're searching in languages with a relatively simple morphology. For English, I'm not using google any more unless ddg tells me to do so :)<p>It is very easy to perform shallow parsing operations on English, because of its relatively simple morphology. However, for agglutinative languages like Turkish, (Finnish, Hungarian and Japanese are also in the same family) where stems can appear under too many forms to enumerate, basic shallow parsing algorithms would not produce as interesting search results.<p>My anecdotal experience with DDG in Turkish seems to go in line with that assumption. So, I think DDG has a lot room for improvement in processing languages with complex morphology.<p>==================<p>A famous illustrative Turkish word is:
uygarlaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına<p>...which decomposes to suffixes as follows:
uygar+laş+tır+ama+dık+lar+ımız+dan+mış+sınız+casına<p>...and translates to english as follows:
behaving as if you(plural) are among those whom we could not cause to become civilized",1274615043
1372143,comment,1371008,1371756,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Chinese chess is fantastic. It's strategically rich, but much harder to screw yourself in the opening than with regular chess. It's also different enough to be delightful to learn for people who already enjoy chess. Two examples that really charmed me:<p>1. There is a jumping piece which attacks by leaping OVER pieces and landing on whichever piece is on the far side. It's possible to defend against this piece by moving other pieces into and out of the path between it and it's target, effectively redirecting the attack.<p>2. Kings cannot face each other on the board, or leave a very small 3x3 section of their territory. This complicates endgame, but makes your king more powerful in locking off the options of your opponent.",1274614857

Including gotos in a language is problematic for reasons other than the fact that programmers tend to misuse them. I think it comes down to the rationale. With the C# feature I mentioned, the stated reason was, inter alia, that programmers tended to misuse inheritance. I found that patronsing. That leaving out goto makes it easier to formally prove a language correct I do not. Leaving out goto because programmers tend to misuse it, that I would find patronising.",1274614388

When possible I choose Python over PHP for web related things.<p>I think the main thing to accept is that if you're going to be coding then you're going to be thinking a lot. If you're not thinking and going on auto pilot then you don't know enough...",1198011575

There's no evidence of a deliberate backdoor, and most of the failure modes for crypto RNGs involve a threat model you don't care about: someone who can read/write memory from arbitrary processes or the kernel.",1198011550
90872,comment,90782,90829,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Think of it this way:  learning a programming language is learning a completely arbitrary and made up language that is used to talk to a hunk of 80 million silicon switches and try to convince those switches to do something complicated.  It's going to take a little while to learn that language.<p>When I first started studying CS at school, I thought that there was some secret knowledge that the true hackers had that allowed them to program without thinking about it.  And alas, I must not have had the hacker gene because I worked at it and worked at it and worked at it until I solved a problem, only to move on to the next problem. <p>Then, it hit me:  That's the secret knowledge.  You just have to keep chipping away at it.  Eventually you'll become good at it.  There's no free ride; it's a lot of hard work.",1198011448

90869,comment,90782,90782,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"I think the route to success with programming is much like maths, medicine or indeed any discipline, go for breadth first then depth. Don't spend all your time mastering one aspect, try to learn many different things at once even if you are actually only interested one specific thing. Once you have even just basic knowledge and familiarity with most facets of a field then you will be better equipped to approach any specialization.<p>So in your case its fine to learn PHP but I would encourage you to look at many different things that are unlike or even the antithesis of PHP. It will help you understand where general computing nomenclature comes from, what the limits of your chosen technology are, how best to implement it in a given environment and ultimately it will give you a much better understanding of the technology itself.",1198011166

""The focus is on competitive self-interest; it's on trying to undermine Microsoft, rather than what customers want to do,"" said Raikes. In other words, he believes that Google is launching an attack for the sake of sabotaging Microsoft, rather than addressing the needs of consumers and what they actually want.

You avoid it by checking the length of the array.<p>Unintentional variable capture is simply a bug.  The only reason it even seems to people that they need a ""way around"" it is that they don't really understand what macros do.",1198009571

The Department said that NAR's policy prevents consumers from receiving the full benefits of competition and threatens to lock in outmoded business models and discourage discounting.""<p>Isn't it interesting to note that in this instance, it does not specify whether the 'consumers' of the broker are considered agents or the actual homebuyers themselves? Most brokers don't deal with the little people (the little people being the homebuyers themselves) . . . they run shops which employ agents who compete with each other (e.g. artificially inflating property valuations).<p>In this wikipedia article on the MLS (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Listing_Service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Listing_Service</a>):<p>''A person selling his/her own property - acting as a For Sale By Owner (or FSBO) - cannot put a listing for the home directly into the MLS. ''<p>So. . . a decent housing search tool aimed at people who want to sell FSBO to people who are not agents themselves and who don't have buyers' agents would probably go over quite well.  <p>The main challenge here would still be that evil Realtor stranglehold . . . keeping the agents away from the FSBOs.",1198009293

90857,comment,90726,90832,0,0,nkohari,,,"There are laws against predatory lending which are intended to protect consumers from lenders trying to take advantage of them. Obviously, they aren't good enough. In my opinion, the real problem is that lenders should never be able to profit if the consumer defaults on the loan. Without the mortgage brokers and hedge funds on the back-end buying the debt from the banks, the banks would be much less likely to issue bad loans, because they would end up getting royally shafted if the purchaser defaulted and they still ""owned"" the debt.",1198009074

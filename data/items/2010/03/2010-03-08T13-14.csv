1175323,comment,1174147,1175285,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> AC2 is not an MMORPG. It's a single player game<p>Yes, I know - MMORPG was simply an example. The main point is that if the content had been worth actual value to the consumer/player then those doing any DDOS would be getting <i>equal flack for their actions</i>.<p>Im sorry but it seems illogical to condone the idea that DDOS'ing the servers to prove a point as a good one :)<p>> Let's make this clear: Ubisoft went out of their way to build a system that prevents their customers from playing their game while non-paying customers can play the game.<p>I think that's a bit mis-representative.<p>Firstly non-paying customers can't play the game: so far I have not been able to find a crack that works fully. We've done some reverse engineering here at work (and we employ some smart bods who do this stuff to enterprise software) and the summation is <i>""parts might be cracked, but definitely not all yet... ooh look at this bit...""</i>. The skid-row crack doesn't work for the whole game just part of it (independently verified). So far as I've read all those yelling ""Told ya! It's cracked"" haven't actually bothered to try it themselves!<p>Secondly they went out of their way to build a system that <i>might</i> prevent <i>some</i> customers playing the game. It's a silly, idiotic system they've invented but it <i>should</i> only affect those with dodgy or no internet connection... instead because of DDOS (unproven, and im not sure this is the case) all customers <i>are</i> affected.<p>They're all idiotic in my book :)",1268056770

Evil spirits lived in the bodies of the living and the dead, but would occasionally jump from a sick person to a healthy person The health person would become sick, and further spread evil spirits.<p>The Romans knew how to prevent the spread of evil spirits: isolate the sick and the dead, and even burn the bodies. They even weaponized it, using the bodies of those that died of plague as a biological weapon.<p>Once we learned that evil spirits don't exist, we threw away this theory of disease. Instead, we believed that plague (much like flies, mold and other such unpleasantness) was spontaneously generated in matter.

Hadn't seen it before.<p>But it appears to be missing what I would regard as being a key piece of functionality: Expenses.<p>We tend to bill time and expenses. Indeed the standard contract we operate under is T&M, time and materials.<p>Materials being travel, accommodation, and stuff like that as well as material in more real terms.<p>Your time UI looks great, but we already have a really ugly time UI that we'll be sticking with. Why? Because the system that stores the expenses is more critical than the system that stores time.<p>We can accept a margin of error and a overhead on submission of time reports, but for invoicing and billing we cannot accept such things when it comes to expenses. One of these things goes into the company filings, one does not.<p>I would love to be able to utilise your time UI, but to do so necessitates some way of extending it to also track expenses.<p>Expenses relate to time because they occur in a moment of time and are nearly always directly attributable to what you were working on at that time.<p>i.e. a taxi for a meeting with client X. Verisign Code Certificate for a piece of code for client Y. Hotel whilst visiting client Z.<p>So it makes sense to record your expense when you incur it... or to enter your expenses at the end of the month (when you get your credit card statement) and then for the date to imply the client.<p>Perhaps you should be looking at partnering on this front? Maybe pick out someone like Buxfer and see if they're keen to work towards owning the books for small and medium companies?<p>Doing this stuff would allow you to also build profitability reports. If you know 3 people work for client X, that you invoiced amount A and that your expenses are amount B... then you know how profitable 3 people are for the time allocated. Important stuff for freelancers and those offering services where time tracking and invoicing matters.<p>Just some ideas. Very much like what I see.",1268055111

I&#x27;m arguing for a &quot;well-enough&quot; informed electorate. Informed enough to strategically make choices about choosing representatives.<p>Abusing mentally ill citizens, performing experiments on the poor and destitute, gathering records on citizenry forever -- these are things that an informed electorate would shut down if given the chance. These are things that the constitution would forbid if it were foreseen.<p>Nobody&#x27;s arguing that secrets can&#x27;t be had. The argument is that those employed by the voters are actively acting <i>long-term</i> in ways neither the voters nor the constitution would approve of. Short term bend any kind of rules you think the system will allow. Long-term? This has got to stop.

So, some people say, &quot;hey, let&#x27;s use a declarative language like XML.&quot; Problem is that you still need to decide what, when and how to display your model. So, we end up with tags or otherwise that are merely attempts to hide logic. <foreach>. Yeah, right.<p>You can go the other way...just put the logic in the controller to format data and otherwise build the model in a way that is cognizant of the view. But, then you&#x27;ve just &quot;polluted&quot; the controller with the view.<p>One approach at solving this is frameworks like Wicket, which (in spite of shortcomings) encourages the use of view components in a way that allows them to render a more organic model. Yes, you may write some Java to render specialized components, but you&#x27;re at least using the same language and being specific about writing rendering code that is also reusable.",1453773461

I personally still feel like that is cheating.<p>I think this comes down to this;  either you think the act of solving the cube is impressive, or you think the ability to turn the cube quickly is impressive.  As someone who can solve the cube in 40-45 seconds (and I&#x27;m admittedly pretty slow), the part that really bogs me down is I&#x27;m not good at finger tricks or turning the cube quickly.

10971360,comment,10964408,10971243,0,0,Lazare,,,"I see your point, however...<p>1) It&#x27;s worth reiterating that there was a huge housing bubble and a massive devaluation.  You say 4% losses is terrible for AAA rated securities (which is true), but you could also say it&#x27;s pretty amazing for subprime mortgages during a massive housing bubble popping.  It&#x27;s like building a levee that&#x27;s meant to stand up to all but the most massive floods, and then having a massive flood; the fact that the levee failed it not <i>itself</i> proof that it wasn&#x27;t engineered correctly.<p>2) The point I was originally trying to make and got sidetracked from is that if (and seems likely to me) there was an extremely widespread systematic belief that there was no housing bubble and that a coordinated, nationwide drop in housing prices was effectively impossible, then you would see the exact outcomes we saw without the corruption or &quot;corrosion&quot; you posit.<p>In short, you&#x27;re suggesting that people knew the loans were going to go bad, and put high grades on it knowing there was a real risk of default.  I would put it to you that actually no one inside the system believed the loans were going to go bad, and the high grades were put on it in the incorrect belief that there was no real risk of default.<p>There&#x27;s been a lot of research on this subject, but to me the most compelling is research showing that &quot;insiders&quot; did not diversify away from the crap they were selling.  See facts 9 and 10 from this paper[1] for example, which notes that Lehman, for example, was using internal models which estimated the odds of a bursting bubble at 5%, whereas they assigned 30% odds to scenarios that assumed absolutely impossible and historically unprecedented house price growth.  Bear Stearns executives invested heavily in their own bank&#x27;s funds which in turn were invested in MBS.  Similarly, many loan originators got into trouble not because they bundled the loans up and sold them on (as their risk models required them to do), but because they kept too many of them, thinking they were great investments.  If Lehman and Bear Stearns and Bank of America were the suckers, who was doing the exploiting?  (And the biggest winners were people like John Paulson, who had no clue how the mortgage market worked, and had never traded mortgages before.)<p>From where I stand, there is a compelling, coherent story of people being idiots, but the cynical, blatant corruption seems missing.  If your model says there&#x27;s a 5% chance of housing prices dropping, then your model is wrong, but your conclusion about the risk of impairment of AAA tranches makes a lot of sense.  So the next question is, well, did you really <i>believe</i> that there was a 5% chance of housing prices dropping?  And the people involved bet their careers and personal fortunes on that, so...apparently they did?<p>Edit: I highly recommend the entire paper, and in particular you may find &quot;fact 12&quot; of interest, as it gets into the weeds on how the ratings were actually calculated, why the ratings on MBSs ended up being mostly accurate, why the ratings on CDOs ended up being completely wrong, and why there was a difference.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppdp/2012/ppdp1202.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppdp/2012/ppdp1202.pdf</a>",1453772361

I&#x27;m only half-kidding. I say hospital because all the laws that have changed in healthcare have driven most doctors out of private practice into hospital positions. since 2004, hospital-employed doctors have gone from 11% to over 60%[1]. One major reason being that with the wave of medical reform, the overhead of running a practice has skyrocketed. &quot;Comfortable and enjoyable&quot; are rarely applicable when you only start paying off your $1m schooling debt at 30.<p>Sorry, I meant suggest taking less patients, in addition to charging enough to match what you were making before. Not just doctors/hospitals making less money across the board. This will encourage more people to be doctors/open hospitals in the long run to fill the demand (then bringing down the price again, until we&#x27;re at a nice equilibrium), which will bring down prices, and ensure that doctors take as many patients as is comfortable.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say other than &quot;They aren&#x27;t&quot;. These are laws, not administrative suggestions. Hospitals expect/need the same output regardless of the laws the government changes.<p>Is there no doctor&#x27;s lobby? If the law is wrong/naive, there are measures you can take to make sure it&#x27;s changed.<p>> I have a life-long condition. I don&#x27;t care when my doctor is typing because I&#x27;ve had it my whole life, it&#x27;s nothing more than maintenance, and I&#x27;ll see them again in 6 months. Imagine being told you have 6 months to live from someone half-sitting behind a computer.<p>Yes, that would be a very insensitive way to convey such information, but that&#x27;s also not the routine case, right? Also, I noted that it seems serviceable for the doctor to cut up the time (in a world where they could set their own billable hours, which could exist).<p>> My father doesn&#x27;t eat lunch, using that time to catch up on notes. For as long as I remember, has left for work at 5am and gotten home at 8pm. He spends his Saturdays and Sundays working. And again, hospital employees don&#x27;t get to choose how many hours they bill.<p>I didn&#x27;t call into question how much current doctors work to catch up on notes -- from what the article said, and your personal experience that is a crazy amount of paperwork. If hospital employees don&#x27;t get to choose the amount they bill, then maybe someone should change the hospitals? Or come up with some other structure for serving patients.<p>My main point condensed:\nThe amount of paperwork doctors are buried under is insane, that much is clear. Doctors are some powerless group of victims -- surely there are some actions they can take to alleviate the problems, especially if what&#x27;s best for patients is what the care about.<p>I did not know about these problems so reading this article was informational for me, but I found it lacking in the &quot;what we&#x27;re going to do about it&quot; department.",1453771621

Stripping tags isn&#x27;t the best way anyway to filter XSS, so if you&#x27;re encoding, you&#x27;re good.<p>So uh, what if your application is taking an input that&#x27;s then parsed by another application with poor output encoding? Granted, the application that&#x27;s properly encoding for the correct context is good, but any applications which <i>don&#x27;t</i> do that but also use that same dataset are screwed because your application didn&#x27;t perform proper input validation.<p>Defense in depth strategies exist for a reason. Input validation, output encoding for every single context (this includes using angular properly, for instance), anti-xss headers, CSP, the list goes on. These aren&#x27;t all prescribed just to protect that one application. They&#x27;re prescribed so that when applied correctly across all apps, they&#x27;re all protected from negligence in one app harming the data.",1453771374

A vast amount of paper wealth nominally owned by the middle class vanished in a puff of smoke; most of the crisis was the result of that. But the impacts of an asset price bubble should properly be attributed to its inflation, not it&#x27;s popping.)<p>Its inflation exists because of how corroded the mortgage ratings were. <i>None</i> of them were correct except relative to each other within the mortgage bond market. You don&#x27;t rate things AAA when they are really BBB. I understand you might feel that is correct but I sure as hell do not.<p><a href=""https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/DefaultResearch/2006600000426807.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/DefaultResearch/200660...</a><p>> Aaa 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% 0.10% 0.07%<p>That is the expected cumulative default rate for a AAA corporate bond. The mean is .10% with standard deviations of .07%. So when you say &quot;4%&quot; that is absurdly high in comparison yet they were marketed and sold as if they were equivalent risks.<p><a href=""https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/06/pdf/dodd.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/06/pdf/dodd....</a><p>> The extent and speed of rating downgrades of asset-backed\nsecurities. Investors have learned to their cost that the credit\nratings of structured credit securities are more likely to suffer\nrapid and severe downgrades than are corporate bonds (see\nchart). Not only have downgrades occurred more frequently\nto subprime securities, they have often been reduced several\nnotches at once because of the sensitivity of such securities’\nratings to increases in assumed credit losses. As a result,\ninvestors’ faith in rating agency opinions has been shaken—\ncredit spreads on AAA-rated U.S. residential MBSs have been\npriced at about the same level as BBB-rated corporate bonds\nsince August 2007.<p>The real value of the AAA-rated residential MBSs were the equivalent of BBB for other securities and had been for years preceding the event. The majority of the market was blinded by the assurances of the credit bureaus which were valuing BBB assets as AAA assets.<p>A credit bureau that doesn&#x27;t consistently <i>and accurately</i> estimate risk across securities is in many ways worse than useless because it gives a false sense of security where none exists.<p>Similarly, captured referees / regulators / credit bureaus cannot be trusted if you are not the sole organization in control.<p>However, I can see how this is likely more in the realm of opinion so I&#x27;ll just leave it here but I think the comparison to corporate bonds  is relevant.",1453770032

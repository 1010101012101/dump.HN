If you come from the U.S. and have never been privy to the payoffs that do occur in the U.S., seeing it so much more open in China can be shocking.  U.S. companies may not be legally allowed to make payoffs, but they certainly do.  Its also illegal in China.  If Google China has never paid kickbacks, they would be the first company of their size in China I have known to not do so.<p>One thing I've noticed in Shanghai is that businesses in competitive markets are increasingly not giving kickbacks as its simply not profitable to compete in some markets this way anymore.  Additionally, there are many (not saying its the majority) Chinese business men and women that take great pride in running a clean business.  For every Chinese dissident whose email the gov wants to snoop on, there exist many hard working people ""doing the right thing"".

In 1965, Japan's nominal GDP was estimated at just over $91 billion. Fifteen years later, the nominal GDP had soared to a record $1.065 trillion by 1980. (11x growth in 15 years.) By comparison China's growth from 1989 to 2004 was ~9x (from your chart).  At the time there was a lot of talk about Japan taking over the world, which did not happen for various reasons, primarily because once you get to near parity with the rest of the world further economic development requires innovation.<p>As to poor returns I meant that China's growth has been has increased as they approached a free market, and there is little evidence to support the advantage (in terms of growth) of a non free market.  Which was a response to <i>I'm not convinced that an open, free-market system is the best solution. Perhaps down the road, but not now.</i><p>PS: I am not saying china's growth is slow, rather young people don't have a lot to compare it to. Industrialization and effective free markets result in massive economic growth.  So I don't think the Chinese government is responsible for growth so much as letting it happen.<p>Edit: As to corruption it's something you have to see first hand.

3670494,comment,3670379,3670423,3,0,blasterford,,,"> People often argue that children don't need to know how to program just as they don't need to be a car mechanic to drive a car. The analogy is useless because a car is a one-use machine (it moves), whereas a computer's very essence is its programmability, its ability to be a universal machine.<p>Surely a better analogy then would be that kids don't need to learn how to build things out of metal (Unless they particularly want to).<p>Welding and metalwork is for some people. Just as programming is for some people and not others.<p>Personally, I don't think we have fallen behind at all. Kids are still learning to program, just as they used to. Being taught in schools is (I guess) a nice to have, but not necessary.<p>It's easy for programmers to think that programming is the only thing that matters and it's crucial everyone learn it. But it's really not. All that matters is that people who wish to learn it, can.",1331032353

I wouldn't be so proud of the financial sector paying engineers fair wages, because the bottom line is it's crumbs to them.  They are skimming more cream off the economy without producing anything tangible than anyone else, so they can afford to pay above market to the privileged few.  It's not a scalable model for increasing average salaries though.<p>The UK (and Europe) really needs to figure that out.  I was able to move to London because I was moving from SV and I got a cost of living increase on top of my US market salary.  If I was born here and forced to accept London market salaries I would be looking for my ticket out of here ASAP.  As technology and mobility increases it's going to be increasingly important to economies to retain talent, something which I believe is obscured for the super rich who make money by arbitrage highly abstracted from the value in the base economy.",1331032107

(I'm guessing not) Do they have good color reproduction or response times? Would it be too frustrating to have to lose desk space as a result of needing to keep your monitor within arms reach?<p>What are your thoughts?",1331031981

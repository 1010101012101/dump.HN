If the cable wasn't shielded, it would act like an antenna and pick up radio-broadcast signals. That would cause interference with the cable signal. But since the shielding electromagnetically isolates the cable, cables and over-the-air broadcasting can use the same frequencies.",1304693992

Saying the earth is flat is more wrong than saying the earth is a sphere, and saying the earth is a sphere is more wrong than saying the earth is oblate spheroidal.

A few thousand Ph.D. theses have been sunk into parallelizing imperative programs. Despite the accumulation of sophisticated compiler techniques, it doesn't really work without extensive annotations and cooperation from the programmer. The programmer often ruins potential parallelism by accidentally creating dependencies between loop iterations.

He sad that future (he does not call it 3.0) is all devices connected to the net and ""talking"" to us. I gave it some thoughts and am unable to find it to be such a huge movement as 2.0 is/was. I mean, I want my fridge to talk with me what's missing in. This way its another thing off my memory's list: I will find out whats missing when shopping, or fridge will order automatically. But if you think about all the work has to be done to make all the equipments <i>compatible</i> with web (whether its your washer dryer, or garage opener, fridge etc), it may actually fail for now.<p>I think social connections will remain base for 3.0, but I think next big thing will be a demarchy network. In short, if 1.0 was you read the web(site), 2.0 was you manage it (ie. you have a power to accept/decline friend connections that came to your <i>feed</i>, ban others posts on your wall, etc), the 3.0 would be a network where you actually take a huge part in writing that network personally. When actually talking to my Facebook friends, asking what do they think about FB, they mostly say its OK, but they complain on each feature more or less and since there is no <i>better</i> network, they use what they got.<p>I can think of some voting system (perhaps this will become a major difference between FB and future network and make people move on..) where all participating users vote on features/tools provided to them by that network's software engineers and accordingly to the result, that network has to comply and provide functionality. Compare it to the government (a better version) where it is actually up to voters to choose who will be in charge of shaping state/country policies and therefore in charge of the quality of voters' life. FB Graph gives you a sample, but still not only it is way too complicated for an average Joe to tap in, and requires you to leave the FB site.<p>What do you think?",1304692447

I think it's more to do with people being told that their beliefs are wrong, and why they're wrong, and getting upset.

I don't think so. Getting told you're wrong in philosophy isn't the same as getting told you're wrong by a compiler, and in the end whatever profession we practice we're still humans with the same biases.

When I took a Scheme class based on SICP, we implemented a Scheme interpreter as well as looking at an OOP system using lambdas.<p>Writing that interpreter is the first time JavaScript's scoping rules made  sense to me viscerally--they're exactly the same as Scheme's. The OOP system we used was also really similar to what you can do with JavaScript; it just used closures to save state. It wasn't exactly the same, but it was similar.<p>Ultimately, I find that JavaScript is much closer to Scheme than other dynamic scripting languages I've used like Python and Perl.",1320519489

But that's only a piece of it; ostensibly, a strong liberal arts program not only exposes you to the best of art, but challenges you to critically examine it.<p>If anything, it seems just as easy to learn tech skills, particularly programming, on your own. And you are easily able to test and prove them to the real world. Think you have a great idea and good design chops? Then launch a site. It doesn't even have to be profitable, just something that can impress one of the many communities of developers (such as HN).<p>Where does that outlet exist for liberal arts majors? As most liberal arts fields don't yet primarily communicate to the web, you could publish a brilliant research paper that is never seen by the ""serious"" academics; same as if you disseminated your theory and findings through a blog.<p>Of course there are exceptions. It's possible that the next Harry Potter could come from a computer scientist who spends his/her off-hours writing a novel and then self-publishes with a viral marketing campaign.

It made intuitive sense to me: wages rising in China, cheaper dollar, higher fuel costs. Not to mention its always harder to run things when your employees are half a world away.<p>The universal reaction was no way they'd bring manufacturing jobs back. Reasons:\n1. Don't want to deal with unions.\n2. Don't want to deal with hidden costs like healthcare etc.\n3. Too many regulations.\n4. Just too hard to scale up or down. Apparently in China if you need to scale up your factory, you send a bus into the countryside to pick up villagers. Train them for 3 weeks and bam you have a factory worker. Who's living in your factory dorm, so they're available for over-time etc.<p>It sounded insane actually, I can't imagine any normal person wanting to work like this.<p>But its great if you are running a factory.",1320518783

This is what the paper cited above defines as expressibility: adding a feature that requires a global transformation increases expressibility.<p>I made no claims about whether or not more or less expressibility is a good thing or how it relates to productivity. Nothing in my responses has anything to do with whether or not functional or imperative styles are better in terms of productivity or maintainability. In fact, by the definition in the paper, adding imperative features to a functional language increases expressibility. Also, adding goto to a language increases expressibility, so it is not a metric that is solely related to maintainability and productivity.<p>I am not arguing that Xtend is a bad idea at all, in fact I think it's a great idea.

While making prices one OEM license higher.<p>Had IBM never allowed MS-DOS to exist (by signing an exclusive deal), PC clones would probably not exist and, if they did, they would run CP/M 86. 32-bit computers would have arrived sooner, as would 64-bit and RISC. Intel would be happy making non-x86 processors (I can't imagine they really <i>like</i> making their current monstrosities). The personal computer landscape would be much more diverse hardware-wise,  (think Amiga, Archimedes, Transputers) but, probably, due to pressures from software market, there would be a cross-platform software standard, most probably around POSIX.<p>Microsoft would be making compilers.

Historically in the US, slavery was legal at one time in some states.  After it was abolished, racism was embodied in the legal code.  Plenty of morally high minded people disagreed with those laws.<p>Whether legal or not, I don't find it acceptable.  Similarly, on CF lists, people routinely post announcements that they have leftover medical supplies of some sort and are willing to give it away for free (sometimes on the condition that the recipient cover postage, sometimes not).  This is generally viewed as socially acceptable on most CF lists because medical expenses for CF are extremely high and people coping with CF are typically financially devastated by that fact.  On the only CF list I own, I announced that this was not an acceptable practice because I think the price of exposure to the germs of another person with CF outweighs the value of the supplies.  So I think that's Not Cool either, even in cases where it happens to be legal (and legality of it varies by jurisdiction in this case and probably also depends on exactly what is being offered).",1320516909

It might work for larger artists with a built-in fanbase, which makes virality easier to achieve since it'll start with some sharing momentum. But for indie artists with very small fanbases (I'm talking hundreds of fans, not thousands), having your music available for free doesn't do as much for you. The fans who would have bought your album will now listen for free and not buy it, and nobody else has heard of you. Plus, explosive virality will be harder to achieve - in general - with such a small number of people to begin with.<p>Again, I'm sure Spotify pays out a significant amount to the record labels and major artists, but I'm talking here solely from the perspective of a small indie musician with a, say, 200 person fanbase.

3200405,comment,3200193,3200268,34,0,Jd,,,"I think the general attitude of lispers is frequently a large turn off. There is a lot of elitism, but it is often a needy Mensa-like elitism. There is almost a hidden plea attached ""please respect us as the smartest"" and the problem is, of course, that they can't point to any tangible, quantifiable method for gauging intelligence with respect to a language. I guess PG's ""let's see if anyone is using it in 50 years"" is a good measure in some case, but that implies that lisp as a language is less of a ""computer language"" (e.g. a language that is made for making machines do what we humans want them to) and more of an artform or philosophical/mathematical depiction of some deeper truth obscured to normal people.<p>I think this is ultimately always a problem between ultra-smart people who live in something of an abstracted world that frequently approaches fantasy and the reality of industry, which generally doesn't care about how pretty something is unless someone will buy it because it is pretty.  That's a pretty large gap, and, while in my opinion there is no need for arrogance, it is pretty clear why most of the smartest people in history end up on the former side of that divide. They want to contemplate some sort of eternal idea which usually they ascribe beauty to (e.g. Bohr, Einstein, etc.) -- and yet hackers, unlike theoretical physicists, are halfway between the people probing the mysteries of the universe and those putting together blueprints for the atom bomb.<p>In my opinion that's just life. Einstein hated the bomb and rightly so in my opinion -- but that doesn't mean that it was any less a necessity for the Manhattan project to go forward. The sad thing, however, is that lots of brilliant people trying to navigate this divide end up with a huge chip on their shoulder. PG talks about this in H&P; the jocks were popular and (surprise!) the nerds were not. So you go out and get a few million and say, ""ha, screw the jocks."" Fine, generally speaking I think that is a good idea, but let's not turn it into a wanker fest since there are lots of needed functions in the world that should probably be performed by those who can't understand Lisp -- and I don't just mean cleaning toilets, I mean politics.<p>Abstraction, which is really what lisp is about in many ways, is only ever IMO one pole. You have to zoom out to see the bigger picture and zoom in to address the minutia. Generally people miss the forest for the trees, so I have every sympathy for those who stick with the forest and ignore the trees. But when it comes down to it, someone has to re-write your code in blub to make a functional product (even true with Viaweb) so have some sympathy for the little man who has to do a sh't job, probably his mother never gave him fairy tales to read and he only vaguely knows who Godel, Escher, and Bach are.  That's sad, but that's life and we who are Americans should especially expect it as an immigrant nation.<p>Anyways, I'm one who discovered Lisp rather late despite and not because of the Lisp community as it is usually presented. I think it is beautiful and esp. I think SICP is a fantastic book to introduce one to computer science concepts and I think that industry should serve great passions and ideas and not vice versa. Hell, I even think lisp machines are a great idea and hope someone builds new ones and they take over the world. But despite all of that, I would never hang out with ""the Lisp community.""<p>Why? I want to build great products. Great products need to scale. If you want to go to the moon you need a f'ing spaceship and not emacs and an open source notebook. Spaceships are big. They take a lot of people to run, and they have to be smart people. One mistake and you are smithereens at Cape Canaveral.<p>The thing that irks me the most about all of this whining is that America used to be capable of building automobiles and space shuttles and (omg!) computers. It was amazing. Now it is hello Taiwan, goodbye America. People talk about ""Rework"" and how they can't imagine being in a company with more than ten people and glorify the life of tribes in third world countries without contraception or toothpaste (or, in pg's case, the lifestyle of lions on the African prairie).<p>I know it may be nuts to say this, but I think we need to build cool stuff for the sake of building it, and that our tools should be <i>our</i> tools -- not some magic fairy dust. Use whatever works to solve the problem. Get your hands dirty. A parentheses is not a hammer if what you've got in front of you is a nail.<p>And if what you've got in front of you is a problem bigger and nastier than that, build a bigger and better tool.

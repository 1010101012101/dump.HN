If one does not want to get shot, then one should not go to war, period.<p>It's soooo amusing to see the big banks who professed ""free markets"" and ""deregulation"" now advocating that short-selling is evil. It's the ""heads I win, tails you lose"" kind of thing. ""Free markets"" are only good just as long as they're winning...",1231948777

Over a hundred people said they did some consulting work, so therefore America is a ""Gigocracy"". Seriously?<p>She makes it seem like a negative thing that people can't describe what they do with a simple sentence. As if everyone should say Hi, I'm Joe the Plumber or Bob the Butcher.<p>Then she describes the ""penny-ante slog"" of working three times as hard for less money without raises. From personal experience, I'm making twice as much money and work maybe half the amount of hours or less. When you start a new project or gig, you decide how much money it will cost, and if it's not worth it to you, then don't do the project. If you want a raise, then you raise your rates.<p>She makes it sound like everyone finds their gigs on Mechanical Turk.",1231948775

The reality is, though, they probably spent a lot of time on this project, and when you divide the $100k up between the people who worked on it and the number of hours they worked, it does not come out to a ton of money.  Also the $100k in a month seems unlikely to be repeated - a bunch of people downloaded it for the ""coolness"" factor, but it will fade and drop off, as happens with so many apps that are basically tech demos rather than truly useful and productive apps. To summarize, this is likely not a good business model.<p>However, that's not to say the project wasn't worth it for the people who worked on it - just a caution that while the headline is catchy, the upside for these guys is probably the resume / VC pitch bullet rather than the money.",1231945923

I learn how to downvote (to indicate a comment that doesn't contribute to the culture or to the discussion at hand) and when to downvote (when a problematic comment is first posted, rather than piling it on later) from other participants. Now that I've been acculturated, I wouldn't dream of downvoting to indicate disagreement. If I don't have an actual comment to write out to indicate my disagreement, I just let it go.

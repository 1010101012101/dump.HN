130486,story,,,4,5,moog,"Ask YC: Would you take a short break before the final push?",,"Say you had one final push required to complete the beta phase of your startup, maybe 7 days of work total. If you'd been working on the startup for months and felt exhausted, would you a) take a short break now, aiming to complete the project in ~14 days or b) keep marching through clenched teeth and have it done in a week?<p>Option b) could be considered DIFN, I guess, which appeals to me. But a short break is also an attractive prospect right now. I've read elsewhere on Hacker News that the hard work doesn't really start until you launch, so is this all the more reason to go with a)?",1204804488

Unless you're working in construction or something along those lines, this isn't going to affect you. I have never met anybody (neither has anybody I know) that has had their passport taken from them for a decade.<p>Well hey unless you hang out with penniless migrant workers you're not likely to hear of it are you?!",1204804137

I suspect there are many people in the world who are 'richer', but we don't know about them because they operate in the 'black' economy or appear much further down the 'official' list.",1204803501

We've just been working on getting our sync engine to work with GMail, using crappy gem's and been writing specs to use their undocumented JSON calls. Which would have been fine, but this is even better.<p>Looks like Google is actually doing something with their Dataportability membership!<p>(BTW for those interested check out www.soocial.com our sync tool)",1204803205

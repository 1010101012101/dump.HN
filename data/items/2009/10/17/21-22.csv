If you don’t agree, get ready for a public stoning.</i><p>Clearly, some very sound thinking! I like this guy already!<p>More seriously, the article is spot on. I have one caveat though: don't settle for what you know if you really want to know something else.<p>For example, if you've been doing PHP programming for years, and know it really well, but are really keen to learn Python and Django, give it a try! My advice would be to try the new language/framework for 2 weeks. It sounds long, but actually 2 weeks is almost nothing.<p>After those two weeks you might go back to your previous language, satisfied that you <i>know</i> it's the right choice since you've tried the grass on the other side and it didn't taste any better. Or perhaps you'll switch to the new language, safe in the knowledge that yes, it is a lot better and you can probably do a better job in this new language.",1255816563

887473,comment,886744,886894,0,0,pg,,,"I think you're mistaken that marketing (in the sense of community building) is an important component of designing a language people would still care about in 100 years.  The history of the Lisp family is a counterexample.  For 50 years (except arguably for a brief interlude in the 1980s) Lisp was popular only with a tiny community of eggheads.  Now thanks to Clojure Lisp is fashionable.<p>The history of such fashions also contradicts your claim that you can lock in a position of leadership by building a big community around your language.  There has been new hot language every 5 years.  First Perl, then Python, then Ruby, now maybe Clojure.<p>The way to make a language popular in the short term is build buzz and libraries, because that's what the average programmer cares about.  But to build a language that turns out to be the ancestor of whatever people are using in 100 years, you have to appeal not to programmers but language designers.  You have to create the ideas language designers want to copy (have to copy, because you found the optimal solution).  That's what McCarthy did.",1255816039

It was designed to be sufficiently efficient on a specific processor (the PDP11, a register based CPU), while providing basic abstractions (function, structures…).<p>C was an overwhelming success. And so were CPUs fast at running compiled C programs. As far as hardware optimization is concerned, the main characteristics of C are pointer arithmetic, manual memory management, and a relatively low ratio of function calls (in C programs).  These are pretty big constraints. So, we ended up with C optimized CPUs. Now what if Unix has been implemented in Forth?  All mainstream processors would have been stack based, and optimized for a very high ration of function calls.<p>C++, by extending C, also have this ""portable assembler"" nature. It also have a number of incredibly low-level mechanisms which can be used to build pretty high-level abstractions, but it's still an extension of C.",1255815893

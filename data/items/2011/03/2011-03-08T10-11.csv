In addition to your typical starving artists, college student, and part-time model that work in the bar. I worked alongside the worldtraveller who wanted to make some coin before moving onto the next city, burnt-out programmer from Wallstreet. Programmer from SF that was working while his girlfriend was in school, thought it was a good excuse to get out of SF. Post-doc comp. sci who just doesn't want to be around computers for now.<p>The manager made it point to only higher beautiful people, according to him. But he also enjoyed the company of smart people (less likely to be on drugs) so went out of his way to hire college students and backpackers.<p>After a few weeks of carrying cases and kegs up and down from the cellar, and partying all night, I was in the best shape of my life.",1299581966

I doubt many pre-industrial societies have a word for ""feminism"", yet would be amazed if someone were to advance the argument that a female perspective on the world only became significant and distinct enough to warrant discussion in the early 1900s - even more so if they were to use it to buttress an argument on female cognitive development.<p>Consider the alternate hypothesis: little attempt is made to describe and analyse adolescence in non-Western societies because: 
(i)those cultures are <i>much less</i> inclined to offer teens freedom of choice and expression
(ii) those cultures have little interest in understanding the psychological development of teens. 
Juvenile crime is not a distinct phenomenon if juveniles are subject to (and deterred by) the same draconian sanctions as adults. Teenage resistance to education is not an issue if teenagers are expected to work to eat. Teenage sexuality is not an issue if society treats sex simply a means to procreation and allows the genders to mingle only in the interests of arranging parentally sanctioned heterosexual marriage.<p>Even if these differences do have a noticeable effect on brain chemistry, I'll happily accept the angst of my teenage years as the price of living in a post-industrial society.",1299581167

And I'd love to see more of the world using Firefox or Chrome. But if I am still using IE6 it's not because I understand my browser options, or even what a browser is. It's because it works, and it's familiar - pushing IE8 helps overcome the familiarity hurdle. And after all, it's used for ""exploring"" the ""internet"" - I already visit Google, I don't want to look at Operas or a Safari, and what the hell is a Mozilla?<p>Maybe ""The Orange swoosh is better than the Blue swoosh.

Step one is to rewrite all your queries so they no longer expect really exotic use cases like ""SELECT ... WHERE"" to actually work until you somehow figure out which nodes to run them on (and if it was supposed to be a join between entities crossing shards, good luck with that). Step two is to find working XA-aware drivers (haha). For step three you need a knife and a goat....<p>Apparently really high-end clustered databases solve this problem correctly, i.e., the schema is extended to specify where any record can be found, the cluster uses that to work out a minimally-stupid query plan, and record->shard mapping becomes merely a tuning decision.

For the majority of folks who must or desire to maintain separate work/personal or friends/family or public/private identities, or who belong to oppressed groups, are clearly not going to be able to relate to it. People without FUx1000 money in the bank (like Mark clearly does) are going to have a hard time relating to it, because without FU money one does have to be much more careful and arguably afraid of what happens when the wrong people see the wrong thing and do something that hurts you down the line.<p>That said, despite his perspective, he clearly has a financial motive to turn Facebook further into the dominant identity system in the web. Actually, I'll take that back, it's not clear to me that he has any motive personally to make it any more dominant, because he's now into the discretionary billions range of wealth. Perhaps his motive is to increase ROI for all the sub-one-percent shareholders. I dunno. I've just never gotten this whole sort of unbounded ambition that thinks it's not good enough to be the 3rd best thing in the entire world -- we're talking the entire world here, it's not like coming in 1000th place, and it's not even truly a race. If anything, it's a race to stand still, and then you die, no matter what.<p>It's interesting to think that there are now more people with a Facebook identity than most meatspace nations have citizens. More <i>Facebookians</i> than Brits, for example. Than French. Japanese. I don't know the exact count of total Facebook users offhand but I wouldn't be surprised to find it's already surpassed the number of US citizens as well.",1299578530

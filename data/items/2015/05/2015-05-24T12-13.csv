I&#x27;ve butchered fish and game since I was in grade school. While I recognize the odors, textures, and sights involved as specific to that process, they don&#x27;t put me off in any way. (Although perhaps in sufficient volume they would; I&#x27;ve never been in a Tyson chicken plant.) Does that mean that it&#x27;s moral for me to eat all the meat I want, while more squeamish people must eat less? Frankly I&#x27;m not sure either way. Maybe the squeamishness of the most delicate among us indicts meat-eating for all of us?",1432472358

True coercion-resistance, I would think, implies that the mechanism has the ability to differentiate a stimulus supplied under coercion, even under the assumption that Mallet could have fed Alice some anti-anxiety drugs to regularize detectable symptoms of stress in her behaviour. (Coincidentally, &quot;truth serums&quot;—i.e. low-dose dissociative anaesthetics, ketamine or PCP being just as workable as sodium pentathol—also have anxiolytic effects. I can&#x27;t imagine a state actor wouldn&#x27;t take advantage of this if the goal is coercion rather than torture-for-the-sake-of-torture.)<p>As far as I know, there is one single useful mechanism for coercion-resistance: precommitment with counterparties. If  Alice and Bob are supposed to have no further contact once the plan is in motion, and Bob knows this, then it is useless to torture Alice into contacting Bob—Bob will take the contact itself as a signal that Alice has been compromised.<p>You can automate this; if Alice (or her device) must attend regular KEx parties to get a new key (i.e. participate in a protocol with a security ratchet), then capturing her or her device prevents her from doing this, and so expires her key material (kicks her keys out of the keybag, basically.)",1432472354

9596076,comment,9593700,9594088,0,0,A1kmm,,,"While it seems (based on other comments) that the product mentioned here doesn&#x27;t do that, if the phone has an alternative link (e.g. GPRS / 3G / 4G) data link to the server that stores the credentials, it would be possible to make this more secure.<p>For example, suppose Alice wants to connect to Bob&#x27;s 802.11g wifi hotspot using 802.11i-2004 (WPA2) authentication in PSK mode. Charlie and Bob have the password; neither want to give it to Alice, but Charlie wants to facilitate Alice to access Bob&#x27;s system. The first step of the normal WPA2-PSK process is to take the password and generate the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) by putting the password through a key derivation function (PBKDF2-SHA1). However, the PMK is essentially just a stretched version of the password - so we will assume Charlie also doesn&#x27;t want to share that. To continue with the connection, Alice needs to compute the same Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) as Bob. The PTK is a hash function computed from the PMK, Alice&#x27;s random nonce, Bob&#x27;s random nonce, Alice&#x27;s MAC address, and Bob&#x27;s MAC address. Alice could send the latter four pieces of information to Charlie over the existing link, then Charlie could send the computed PTK back to Alice, allowing Alice to make the 802.11g connection without revealing the PMK or password to Alice.<p>A similar way of transferring enough information to allow the connection to continue is likely possible for other authentication modes like the various 802.11X options.<p>Of course, implementing this would probably require, at least, a rooted phone (for example, to replace the stock wpa_supplicant on Android).<p>Also, the server would need to store the password or PMK itself (either in plaintext or encrypted with a key that is kept available at all times to process incoming requests), so it would have a huge database of credentials that could be compromised.",1432471944

More on that later.<p>First, there has been lots of discussion around &quot;<i>WPF is dead</i>&quot; since that soundbite was made popular by former Microsoft PM Scott Barnes back in September 2010[1].  Predictably, Microsoft denied it with typical business-speak (e.g. &quot;we&#x27;re still committed to WPF, yada yada&quot;) but Scott did call its demise correctly.  You see, you have to understand Microsoft&#x27;s (and most companies&#x27;) modus operandi to notice how something actually &quot;dies&quot;.  They don&#x27;t &quot;kill it&quot; by lighting up a neon sign and issuing A Big Press Release exclaiming, <i>&quot;We just killed WPF and you will thanks us later!&quot;</i>  The way companies kill products is to not give it first class attention such as adding new cutting edge enhancements and diverting resources away from it.  It&#x27;s very rare for a company to plainly state that they will abandon a technology.  (Adobe publicly stating they will prioritize HTML5 over Flash would be a rare example.)<p>As for the word &quot;dead&quot; in technology discussions, it has 2 meanings:<p>#1 &quot;dead&quot; -- as in no longer the preferred, preeminent, first class technology; publishers no longer release new books about it; it is not updated for the latest operating systems or hardware platforms (e.g. iPhones, etc).<p>#2 &quot;dead&quot; -- as in formal official definitive statement from vendor that it is abandoned, not supported, and nobody anywhere uses it anymore.<p>Almost always, when people proclaim &quot;X is dead&quot;, they&#x27;re talking about definition #1, and the people who argue against it are talking about definition #2.<p>If someone says &quot;Latin is dead&quot;, they&#x27;re talking about definition #1.  It means that today, Hollywood movies will have actors speaking in English, not Latin.  The latest Stephen King novel will be English not Latin.  We&#x27;re not using Latin to type out comments on HN.  Latin has been &quot;dead&quot; for several hundred years.<p>The detractors countering with &quot;Latin is not dead&quot; are using definition #2 and will say they just saw a blog post exclaiming  &quot;carpe diem!&quot; and a mathematics proof concluding with Latin phrase &quot;QED&quot;.  High school and colleges still offer classes to teach Latin.<p>That&#x27;s the ongoing sorry state of discussions around the word &quot;dead&quot;.  The 2 camps just talk past each other and perpetuates the endless cycle of disagreements.<p>In any case, just like Latin is &quot;dead and also not dead&quot;, &quot;WPF is dead <i>and</i> not dead&quot; depending on what the context is.<p>[1]<a href=""https://twitter.com/MossyBlog/status/23980976666"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/MossyBlog/status/23980976666</a>",1432471601

Essentially the way of invoking a method on a pointer receiver (like &#x27;->&#x27; in C/C++) isn&#x27;t any different than invoking it on a value receiver (like &#x27;.&#x27; in C/C++). But you can&#x27;t pass &#x27;pointer to int&#x27; to a method where &#x27;int&#x27; is expected.<p>> some simple, compile-time validated sugar to pass the error value up the call chain<p>This bothers me a bit, too. Sometimes I was able to work around it in a creative way. Take http handlers as an example:<p><pre><code>  func standardHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // errors may occur here...
  }
</code></pre>
You can wrap these in an error handling function like this:<p><pre><code>  type naiveHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) error

  func handleErrors(fn naiveHandler) {
    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      if fn(w, r) != nil {
        // handle errors
      }
    }
  }

  http.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, handleErrors(handler1))
  http.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, handleErrors(handler2))
  // ...
</code></pre>
This is handy since you can handle different errors differently - eg. report, log etc - but uniformly between all handlers. To be fair the only syntactic sugar I&#x27;d need in most cases is an equivalent of a C/C++ macro:<p><pre><code>  RETURN_ERR_UNLESS_NIL(/* Go expression returning only error */)</code></pre>",1432471158

If you read my first comment and it&#x27;s parent again, you&#x27;ll see that the generalized vs targeted situation is exactly what I&#x27;m talking about and no more or less. There is no falsity there, you can have one or the other.<p>How this is actually implemented is not something I ever wrote about nor is HN really the place for it. There are some contextual based options other than tracking user behaviors but at the end of the day, yes tracking is how you get to the most targeted information. This is used in more than just ads by the way, everything from your search results to emails to music/video services to any other place you get recommendations is personalized to you. And the vast majority of the population has time and again shown they have more interest in the end result of better content for them than the collection of anonymized information.<p>Do you have a better solution? How would you provide targeted ads that match people&#x27;s interests and intent without any tracking? And please don&#x27;t say you just don&#x27;t want ads or that sites should just figure out a different way to get paid. This is a serious question because it&#x27;s not like the industry has just been sitting around wondering, so if you have a better idea it would be helpful and there are lots of companies willing to hear it.<p>Last thing re: EULA. I&#x27;m sorry but I have to disagree. Legal agreements do not become void because you signed a big contract and then claim it&#x27;s too long or you didn&#x27;t actually read it. And yes, signatures are not required for agreement and acceptance to be binding. These documents do not exist for convenience and the long length with all the complex edge case wording is precisely because standard language is so often contested by anyone who suddenly feels like they no longer want it to apply.",1432470568

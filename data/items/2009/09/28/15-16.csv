848638,comment,848523,848523,0,0,tptacek,,,"Good work from Bruce Leidl's team at Netifera (Bruce is brl, a regular).<p>Long story short: with all the mainstream hash algorithms, if you know the length of a hashed message, you can take its hash and from it synthesize the hashes of messages with  arbitrary suffixes. It's called a message extension attack.<p>A really common pattern in hand-rolled authentication schemes is to hash a message needing authentication with a secret key, and then send the message and the hash. If you know the secret key, you can verify the message. The secret key doesn't need to be sent at all.<p>If your scheme is vulnerable to message extension attacks, attackers can mint arbitrary messages with valid authentication by taking an already-authenticated message and extending it to cover a suffix that changes the meaning of the legitimate message. It's a game-over flaw.<p>Colin Percival noticed a related (but less serious) flaw in Amazon's AWS authentication scheme. At the time, people asked if he'd looked at Flickr's scheme. He had, but not very closely. Colin's flaw was in canonicalization of messages, which is a more obscure attack (by a little bit) than message extension, which is is described in the Wikipedia under ""Cryptographic Hash Function"". Colin didn't flag this flaw.<p>Which just shows to go you: crypto primitives are radioactive. You are not going to get them right. Use high-level interfaces like GPG or SSL or cryptlib, or design your app not to need crypto.",1254153304

848633,comment,847720,847720,0,0,ramanujan,,,"This is a good paper with an empirical example of a <i>molecule level</i> ratchet effect, but the message here is way overstated. It is definitely NOT the case that evolution ""can't go in reverse"" as a categorical statement.<p>1) First and most importantly, if selection pressure was reversed in sexually reproducing species, it is (a) unlikely that the ancestral allele will ever <i>completely</i> die out and (b) also unlikely that a sequence of recombinational events could not reconstruct the ancestral allele.<p>So reversed selection pressure would lead to an increase in frequency of the ancestral allele. Doesn't require the (much higher) level of difficulty of pushing six consecutive mutations to fixation in a single protein.<p>In bacteria or archaea it would be even easier -- just pick up the ancestral allele through horizontal gene transfer.<p>2) Second, even discounting sexual reproduction for now, given strong enough reversed selection pressure, either the species would go extinct or (more likely) some other protein would have been co-opted into pursuing the new function. That is, this road might be blocked but another one will almost certainly be open.<p>3) Third, this <i>particular</i> example has an accumulation of several mutations that act as blockades in fitness space.\nBut this is far from generally proven. You'd need to do some serious correlation of activity with multiple sequence/structure alignments across large families of proteins to show this ratchet effect.<p>4) Finally, the whole concept of QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationships) is based on the idea that activity-structure relationships <i>tend</i> to be more continuous than not, in the sense that small changes <i>usually</i> have small effects on activity [though in dealing with adding atoms to molecules, you're talking about irreducibly large step sizes in different dimensions]).<p>And continuous alterations in activity usually imply reversibility as a function of many small steps.",1254153064

It's purpose is to make money. Everything it does is subordinate to that goal. Maybe this wouldn't be true if it was just the founder's fun project, but it's not - they took tons and tons of VC money, invested on the assumption that they would be turning a profit. It doesn't matter how popular they are, or how many viewers they have if they can't leverage that into turning a profit.<p>In the words of Musashi - ""The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch the enemy's cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.""<p>It makes absolutely no difference how popular or revolutionary you are if it doesn't make you any money.<p>And while in pre-internet times, when viewers translated directly into dollars (which is why it's got such high valuation), it would be a safe assumption that it will, it's far from clear that the same rule applies today. There's many huge services that aren't profitable because no one's figured out how to make money off of them yet. Saying something like ""I have no doubt twitter will do very, very well"" seems unjustified given the fickle nature of internet users and the fact that the rules for building a profitable online service are more alchemical than scientific at this point.",1254152265

Scalability-wise, that looks good enough for me.<p>3) Kind of agreed, but then again, the documentation of PostgreSQL really rocks.

I don't know about related tools, because I don't generally have need for any. There's PGAdmin III which, AFAIK is updated as often as PostgeSQL itself.<p>5) You don't need the advanced features, until you use them and then you can't live without them. It's like addiction to drugs :-) - I moved from MySQL to Postgres back in the days (end of 2001) for a large project after spending hours and hours of hair-pulling due to the lack of subqueries and views in MySQL and since then, I never wanted to go back.<p>We're using PostgreSQL as the backend database for multiple large e-commerce applications.

Log your hours on every project (don't burden yourself, round to the :15). You can't manage what you don't measure; this includes client expectations in regard to project scope / fees. This is where the ad industry has it right, creatives have been beaten down by clients since the dawn of advertising. We're talking centuries of abuse. :)<p>I usually bucket hours into 3-5 categories per estimate/proposal: client service (meeting/phone calls/etc), consulting, creative, technical, and production. Each valued at their own hourly rate. ($80, $200, $150, $150, $100 respectively). Every proposal has a high-level budget that is approved by the client. When it comes to invoicing however, we bill to-the-hour and aim to invoice 5-10% less than the soft bid if they are a good client. Billing by the hour makes the client much more conscious of feedback and ""design by committee"".<p>This works for us, we have pretty good margins when it comes to service related work without getting killed by client demands, paperwork, or tedious processes.",1254150562

mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua
destroyed them utterly with their cities.<p>11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.<p>11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel
according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from
war.<p>12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel
smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the
rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the
plain on the east: 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in
Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river
Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even
unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
12:3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto
the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to
Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: 12:4 And the
coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants,
that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 12:5 And reigned in mount
Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the
Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon

5678724,comment,5678201,5678201,14,0,yajoe,,,"tl;dr -- meh.  Newfound hope for Nook brand.  B&N can go private.  Microsoft has a shot to win at digital college textbooks.  Bearish on rest.<p>For anyone curious about the motivations behind this -- this sale frees up B&N to take its brick and mortar stores private.  The CEO Riggio (? -- name escapes me now) has been asking for different private equity groups to buy the nook (""New corp"") assets for some time since he thinks the stores are much more profitable.  Last quarter results only confirmed as much (Nook did horribly, brick and mortar held their own).  The one piece holding up spinning off the brick and mortar business was what to do with new corp and how much of a premium to give back to shareholders.  Probably more interesting is how much of the college textbook business Microsoft got in the deal (distribution rights, retail locations, etc.).  The textbook business combined with the emergence of new interactive college education is arguably more strategic than the reader.  Microsoft could try to compete with iBooks for the next generation of textbooks and thus require people to get Surfaces (or Win8 or whatever) for college classes.  We have to wait for the SEC paperwork to see for sure.  I have little confidence MS can execute on such a strategy, but it sure looks good on powerpoint.  There also is a bit of bravado at play -- Microsoft needs to demonstrate to its partners and their investors it will come rescue them when needed (think Nokia and Dell).<p>The reality is that Amazon won the current generation of e-ink and online e-books.  If color were to come to market (still just a prototype), it wouldn't be enough of a game changer.  The next form factor to watch for and opportunity for someone to disrupt in e-ink is thin, flexible, and transparent e-ink -- the kind you can roll or fold up.<p>For tablets, Microsoft would likely adopt the Nook brand since it's slightly better known than the Surface, but otherwise they would throw all of the existing tech away.  It's too dependent on Android, and Microsoft would prefer to push its own tech.  It makes me wonder if Nook's announcement to open up the tablet was the GM's way of doing right by customers should Microsoft make an extreme change (this deal would have been known by the people who approved betting on Google Play for Nook).<p>The content play from this is questionable -- B&N is basically an American brand with most e-book sales growth happening elsewhere.  Yes, Microsoft needs content in the US, but tech growth and new customers are elsewhere and this purchase doesn't really help Microsoft that much beyond what they could have gotten from the existing partnership.",1368071785

In grad school, I TA'd a physics class for pre-med students, which were widely considered to be one of the most miserable and obnoxious groups to teach.  Each student felt entitled to an A, even though the department mandated that only 25% of students could receive an A.  In reality, probably more than 80% of the class earned an A, and I would have felt comfortable that most of the rest were smart enough to one day give me medical advice.<p>Yet, less than 45% of people who applied to one or more medical schools [1] are admitted (and this is a self-selected group: those without 4.0 GPAs, three extra-curriculars, and a side-business of helping old ladies across the street generally don't apply).  I would estimate that only about the top 15% to 25% of the class actually applied.  So, from undergrad pre-med to MD, there is about a (hand-wavy) 90% attrition rate of people who are probably smart enough and probably willing to work hard enough, and who have the desire to become doctors.<p>> Increasing the number of doctors produced locally would seem to me to be a much easier way of increasing supply.<p>I agree, but the medical profession is not willing to allow this to happen.  Each medical school has a quota, and nobody wants to rock the boat.  The trouble is, there isn't really any way to force medical schools to admit more students.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school_in_the_United_St...</a>",1368070195

Remote-shell protocols traditionally work by conveying a byte-stream from the server to the client, to be interpreted by the client's terminal. (This includes TELNET, RLOGIN, and SSH.) Mosh works differently and at a different layer. With Mosh, the server and client both maintain a snapshot of the current screen state. The problem becomes one of state-synchronization: getting the client to the most recent server-side screen as efficiently as possible.<p>This is accomplished using a new protocol called the State Synchronization Protocol, for which Mosh is the first application. SSP runs over UDP, synchronizing the state of any object from one host to another. Datagrams are encrypted and authenticated using AES-128 in OCB mode. While SSP takes care of the networking protocol, it is the implementation of the object being synchronized that defines the ultimate semantics of the protocol.",1368069462

However, most everything follows Cocoa conventions, and the headers should be pretty readable. Absolute worst case, there's an existing app using the framework as an example. :)<p>You can also combine ARC and non-ARC code in one project. HNKit was written before ARC (although I still prefer manual memory management), but there's nothing keeping you from using HNKit with an ARC-based app. And unless you're modifying HNKit itself, you wouldn't ever need to see or write any retain or release calls as a client of the API. Apple did a pretty good job making ARC and non-ARC code interoperate well.<p>I'm happy to help with any HNKit questions  feel free to open issues on GitHub if there's anything confusing. HNKit already supports most of the things you are hoping to implement (logging in, commenting, voting), so I would hate to have all that effort duplicated. If you have any specifics about things that could be done better, I'm all ears.<p>Performance-wise, HNKit hasn't been optimized, but it does do parsing on a background thread.

I have been able to work through the frontend (I'm a competent designer) while my co-founder handled the backend.<p>I now consider myself comfortable with HTML, CSS and jQuery. However, while a mock frontend is getting there, it's obviously not enough. I started using jQuery to handle AJAX calls to load in JSON data. I quickly recognized it could get overwhelming, so I have decided to jump into Javascript MVC frameworks (specifically AngularJS). However, I feel like there are just a lot of basic fundamentals I'm missing.<p>After reading this http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/05/02/ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-1-of-3/ and being directed to the ngBoilerplate build system (http://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate/#/home) I realized that there were some things I'd never dealt with:<p>1. Testing. My ""testing"" consists of just reloading a browser page and reworking code until it works as intended. I know there are far more efficient methods. And I know that testing is essential (my co-founder writes tests in Rails before writing up functionality sometimes), but for frontend development when and where is it applicable? What framework (i.e. Jasmine?) to use? And I'm sure there questions I don't even know to ask.<p>2. Task Runner (ngBoilerplate uses Grunt) - a bunch of automation that I'm sure I'll want to use, but would love to know more about when and why.<p>3. Directory Structure - by file type or feature (ngBoilerplate suggests this)? Pros/cons? Best practice?<p>Obviously these are just the things included in ngBoilerplate I wasn't sure about. But I know there might be even more.<p>So, any help is greatly appreciated.

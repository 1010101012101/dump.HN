Before there was the internet, before there was telephone, some retail companies got their start shipping catalogs to rural people. The people would order items via mail, and the items would be shipped via train or mail.<p>Two of the biggest mail order retailers were Sears and Montgomery Ward. To make sure that customers reached for the Sears catalog first, they made theirs slightly smaller (about 1 cm smaller in width and height) so that the folks in the house would stack the smaller catalog (Sears) on top of the larger one (MW).

1822843,comment,1820294,1820294,0,0,dbingham,,,"This argument is circular, at least with respect to the Ph.Ds.  The primary field of employment for those with Ph.Ds is higher education.  The deal is they are paid by universities to teach students and do research.  When there is less funding for the university and less students to teach, there is also less funding for research.  And less money to hire Professors.<p>The fact that so many with Ph.Ds are underemployed is symptomatic of a lack of funding for these institutions.  Using that data to claim that it reveals that these institutions are over funded reveals a lack of understanding of the field in question.<p>Furthermore, the rest of the posted argument takes the data out of context.  The context is one of the worst economic downturns of the last hundred years.  With the highest unemployment and underemployment rates we've seen in a long time.<p>Of course there are tons of people with college degrees working shit jobs.  We knew that already.<p>Finally, those who the author calls ""higher education apologists"" want higher education to be a general thing not simply because it leads to more productive citizens, but rather because of the value society as a whole receives when the standard of education is higher. Especially with respect to our citizen's duties toward our Democratic society.<p>""In a republican nation whose citizens are to be led by reason and persuasion and not by force, the art of reasoning becomes of first importance."" --Thomas Jefferson",1287816139

The US has done no such thing and has only ever proposed to leave the Iraqis alone and under a democratic government that they can themselves control. The US has only stayed so long as to ensure that said government is free of corruption and coercion and able to protect its citizens from nefarious causes.<p>To compare what the US has done to that of the Nazis is the most unjust characterization imaginable. Obviously injustices have occurred but on a scale that pales in comparison to the the intentional actions of the Nazis. Please put everything in perspective.

I could come up with similar numbers via anal extraction and have them be just as relevant to the question at hand.  That is not at all.<p>As for partying for 4 years and passing -  Yes, there are some who party for four years, learn nothing and pass college.  There are even some who do it on scholarship or government grants. But those are the exception, not the rule.<p>In my experience the ones who partied like crazy and learned nothing were the ones there on their parent's dime.  The ones who were there on government dime rarely left the library, worked their butts off and came away with an excellent education.<p>It's true, your mileage may vary, but if you ask me it is of great benefit to society that everyone gets the best level of education they can handle as determined by the quality of their mind and determination, not the quality of their parent's bank account.<p>After all when you're of the age to be applying to college you haven't had the chance to begin being a productive member of society or make any money of your own.  The whole point of education is to make people productive members of society.  So what determines whether you can pay your own way in college is whether or not your parents were productive members of society -- and no one should be limited by their parents.  We'd lose a lot of very bright people that way.<p>That's what government subsidies are for.  They are an investment by all of society in our future.  And in the people of our future.  Think of it like venture capital investment.  Not every investment works out.  But if even a few really do succeed, then the investment in all those who don't is worth it.  Of course the place where the analogy fails is that unlike with venture capital where only a few will succeed, with college subsidies only a few will fail.",1287814270

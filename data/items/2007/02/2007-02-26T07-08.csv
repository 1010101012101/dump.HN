Not as ridiculous as a few years ago, but it&#39;s still wickedly popular.  And from my perspective the alum retention rate, as the article mentions, is very strong.<p>I think the genius of Facebook is not just the eliteness, but instead a new word I&#39;ll makeup called &#39;localness&#39;.  Facebook cordons off the scary, wild web and presents you with people that you know or could at least see yourself knowing or bumping into.  Combine that with early entry into the social networking world, very strong and appealing UI, and yes, eliteness, and a few years later, you&#39;ve got 18 million users.",1172475916
1135,comment,1043,1114,0,0,jwp,,,"The first link you cited is spot on.  The authors are from Univ of Cambridge, and work on HTK <http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/>.  <p>That paper is 10 years old.  As I&#39;m sure you can imagine, there have been improvements in the field since then.  To be completely honest, I don&#39;t stay on top of search applied to speech, but the keyword you want is &#34;Spoken Document Retrieval&#34; (SDR).  Ciprian Chelba and TJ Hazen do cool stuff in this area; they are giving a tutorial at ICASSP this year SDR.<p>An aside.  Both of these approaches use the fact that when you process speech, you essentially form a graph of words (or phonemes).  Paths through the graph represent possible transcriptions.  So, since graph is a denser, richer thing to search than the transcript, and we&#39;ve got graph algorithms sitting around, there are neat tricks you can do to build a search engine index for speech...  <p>I&#39;ve recently been reading some interesting work that uses locality-sensitive hashing to search audio.  The Google speech people are presenting a lot of it at ICASSP this year.   See this post for more, and chase the links in their papers for even more:  <http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2007/02/hear-here-sample-of-audio-processing.html>",1172475886

I was wondering what others thought about this.  Of course I say this as my ETS (Estimate Time to Startup) is a few months away....  ",1172474945

Same for MSFT.  Remember the Kai-Fu Lee thing?  The guy who built CMU Sphinx, an open-source HMM-based speech recognizer, in the late 80s?  He and many other solid speech people are at Google to work on searching audio/video.<p>And there are other companies in this space, but they tend to center around US gov customers.  Virage is one.  It&#39;s owned by the Autonomy group, where, according to the article, the founder of this company used to work. <p>There&#39;s also Podzinger, a subsidary of BBN, which is another company that gets a lot of gov business.  Podzinger runs BBN&#39;s speech recognition system on podcasts and videos, and pipes the output to a search engine:  <http://podzinger.com/>.  <p>I could go on...  And if people are interested, I&#39;d be happy to post links to some relevant papers and tools.<p>To my mind 2 interesting things are going on here.  1) The company appears to be thriving by applying 20 year-old stuff from the lab to a new problem, in apparently no special way.  (And that&#39;s not a bad thing!)  2) They got an article in the NYT business section to talk about Hidden Markov Models.  Although maybe that&#39;s not so surprising, since hedge funds have recently started speaking out about using machine learning.",1172474282

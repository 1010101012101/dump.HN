7698892,comment,7698002,7698002,66,0,augustl,,,"I own a 2013 XC60 and as a programmer, I&#x27;m amazed at how well their current automation works in practice. The car reads road signs to show me the current speed limit in the dash (actual OCR, not a GPS database). It works amazingly well, except when it&#x27;s very dark in the winter. Adaptive cruise control flawlessly follows cars based on radar, even in somewhat dramatic full stops, e.g. when there&#x27;s suddenly heavy traffic ahead. I always have my foot on the break pedal just in case, but I&#x27;m yet to have to intervene.",1399301947
7698891,comment,7698002,7698543,15,0,nabla9,,,"There is nothing else that gets the accuracy Google needs. Sensors are currently unsolved problem. Multi wavelength radars don&#x27;t yet have the accuracy and they don&#x27;t work well with nonmetallic objects (There is limit of how much radar can use power (safely) and how expensive it can be. What works for F-22 don&#x27;t work for Google)<p>Google is not planning to monetize this technology anytime soon, despite the hype.<p>The difference between crude human/animal intelligence and top notch AI-research is still huge. If people would need the accuracy that Google&#x27;s car needs to move reliably and do split second decisions, we could never leave our house. We operate using just two cameras and accelerometers. The clear picture and spatial recognition is done using top notch heuristics in the unconscious. With self driving car it&#x27;s the opposite. They need millions of very accurate distance measurements  per second to drive. Driving like Google car does with cameras only is not happening yet.",1399301941

I&#x27;ve hacked a bit with Ruby (One Month Rails and some other tutorials), but I&#x27;m not sophisticated enough to know instinctively how to refactor towards &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;elegant.&quot;  Most of my code is pretty ugly, and gets uglier the longer I work on it, since when I&#x27;m hacking on something without guidance I spend a lot of time just trying not to break things.  Is there a good resource for a non-programmer to start learning Clojure?  The syntax is a bit scary to me, but I just think back to when I first learned about programming and figure diving in will eventually make it read more sensibly to me.<p>Also, being connected to a live REPL seems pretty valuable for learning.",1399301879

So you need to abstract that away somehow and that abstraction is guaranteed to be leaky to some degree.<p>The thing that separates react from the rest (disclaimer: I work on react) is that these leaks are pushed to the edge of your system (that is, you need an external signal to re render) rather than threaded throughout your system (like requiring everything to go through $scope for one).

7698760,comment,7698603,7698603,33,0,exelius,,,"This sounds like a pretty typical trajectory for a failed startup: CEO dreams big, encourages sales guys to chase big fish through the commission structure, but meanwhile the big fish demand more features, guarantees, complex contracts, etc. than 15 smaller customers would. I&#x27;ve seen it happen quite a bit; and it&#x27;s one of the biggest (and most common) mistakes that B2B software startups make.<p>An early-stage company really needs two things from its customers: cash flow and feedback. It&#x27;s fine if you don&#x27;t make any profits, but you need revenue coming in the door to get future rounds of funding. It&#x27;s fine if your revenue per customer is lower than you would like. Small customers are great at both: price it low enough to start that it&#x27;s not a huge business expense for them, and you will be able to deal directly with the people who will use the system. If they have a problem, your product guys will know and be able to relay it to development.<p>Big customers often get you neither. They require lengthy contract negotiations that will rack up thousands in lawyer&#x27;s fees from your side before you bring in any revenue. They ask for features that aren&#x27;t core to your product and are likely years down on your roadmap (think LDAP authentication, customer admin functionality, audit logs, etc.) Again, these have to be developed before they sign a contract and before you see money. If you actually manage to get them into a production environment, they&#x27;re much less likely to give you actionable feedback.<p>tl;dr: B2B software startups that target big contracts are much more likely to fail because the market dynamics of chasing after big customers will increase your burn rate while diverting your sales team&#x27;s attention from smaller fish.",1399300506

Automatic binding and updating yada yada. Why is this author flaming Angular.JS? Was it because its leaky abstraction turned out ugly over time? Well the same fate is awaiting React.JS and its &quot;minimally leaky abstraction&quot;.<p>Leaky abstractions never remain &quot;minimally leaky&quot; over time. The fact they&#x27;re leaky from the very start shows the model was flawed to begin with.<p>Angular.JS does manual compare between two large model objects to detect changes and emit model update events.<p>React.JS does manual compare between virtual DOM and real DOM and emits DOM update events.<p>They both try to solve the hardship of having to update your DOM, via an abstraction that only works well in specific circumstances and incurs irreducible runtime overhead when behind the scenes structures have to be compared over and over and emit update/change events.<p>Sometimes the problem is in the platform. But even more often a bad developer blames the platform for their own inability to architect their app cleanly and thinks leaky abstractions are the answer.",1399299799

7698679,comment,7697955,7698586,9,0,jhh,,,"I&#x27;ll try to dispel some of the concerns about Clojure.<p>1) Stacktraces in JVM may be ugly, but the amount of insight into runtime issues that the JVM offers you is generally way higher than in runtimes like cpython or MRI.<p>2) Clojure gives you a rather elegant way to work with the different JVM number types as it offers literals for those. I think Java Longs (the integer default) should be long enough as it&#x27;s a 64 bit value. And on the floating point side the default is a double, which also seems nice to me. See: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/dat...</a><p>Above this Clojure offers BigDecimal literals and native ratios.<p>3) The startup time is gigantic. However, while developing you usually should not have to restart the JVM as you can update the JVM with new bytecode through the REPL. This should also dispel the concern about unit tests (although I&#x27;m not sure you can reach the necessary speed, if you talk about < 0.5 second unit tests, because the code needs to be compiled to JVM bytecode 1st. There&#x27;s definitely still potential there.",1399299594

That is, an understanding of the concepts and established mechanisms for dealing with abstract reasoning and patterns is required in order to have any hope of moving further in mathematics.<p>---<p>I&#x27;d agree with you, if what we taught was an understanding of the concepts and established mechanisms. However, it seems to me that, most of what I saw in schools was just symbol manipulation.<p>For example, people didn&#x27;t actually seem to understand that to get the area of a circle you took the radius, multiplied it by the ratio of the diameter to the circumference and squared it. They understood that you took the radius, multiplied it by a magic number, and for unknown reasons squared that.<p>The mapping of the symbols onto reality was often missing. It wasn&#x27;t problem solving beyond the level of having a lookup table in your head that said &#x27;When calculating an area do this, then this, then this.&#x27;<p>All that said, there are things it makes sense to memorise after you understand them - low level components where the speed gained in doing so allows you to use them in higher level abstractions. My point isn&#x27;t that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to teach people tools.

Using any code review tool doesn&#x27;t help if you don&#x27;t get code review done right. If you filter notifications based on rules in the tool or let the developers do it via email filtering is basically a question of philosophy.

No matter which repository hosts my code, I do code reviews on my computer with my own developer tools. I&#x27;m not even sure how the current version of GitHub or Bitbucket diffs looks like.

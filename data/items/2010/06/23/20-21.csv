It's just the concentration of recognizable tech names, and a few signature campuses, that will catch your eye.<p>In the valley, the Computer History Museum, the Stanford Campus (and nearby Palo Alto), Fry's Electronics (especially the flagship store in Sunnyvale), and Weird Stuff (also Sunnyvale) could be worthwhile stops to get the regional vibe.<p>The recommendation to look up overlapping events and attend those is a good one: their frequency and quality is one key to the tech scene.<p>In San Francisco, a walk around the Moscone Conference Center area will get you a feel for where decades of tech conferences have happened. A couple blocks away is the SF Apple Store -- though nowadays Apple's stores elsewhere are larger and more distinctive. A few blocks in the other direction from Moscone is a very high concentration of software/media/social startups (SOMA/South Park/etc.), though the buildings are mostly nondescript. The Presidio in north SF is park-like, along the bay with great views of the Golden Gate, and features Lucasfilm/Lucasarts offices, with statues of pioneers of movies, TV, and the Force.<p>Not precisely 'silicon valley', but still part of the bay area science/tech/startup scene, the Berkeley campus area across the bay is also a nice stop for many.",1277326608

Before you downvote me, at least read what I have to say.<p>This email is a classic example of poor communication. It's very clear that the guy is frustrated and is taking it out via an emotional response. However, we don't know the whole story here, do we? From my reading, it <i>sounds</i> like this has been an ongoing problem for awhile now. Keep in mind that this was in 2001, not exactly an easy time to be running a software company. I can imagine the frustration of running a large company with thousands of employees and seeing a lack of results, coupled with evidence of employees not spending much time at work. What would <i>you</i> do in such a case? Not necessarily with regard to the email, which I think we can all agree was in poor taste, but with regard to the actions he says he's going to take.<p>Additionally, we don't know if this memo did in fact kill morale at the company. We know that the company has done well over the last nine years, and that Mr. Patterson was recently honored as one of the best bosses in the country. The Wikipedia entry specifically mentions the metric of great performance relative to compensation, so he's obviously creating value.<p>I guess my point is that everyone makes mistakes, especially when they're frustrated and facing a large problem. And make no mistake, managing a software company with several thousand people in 2001 would be a challenge. I'm not saying this was the right approach, but what <i>exactly</i> would you do? And more importantly, if you've never faced management at that scale, why do you think it would be more effective than his approach?",1277326291

The programmer who doesn't care about clothing is not far removed from the programmer who doesn't care about small talk or politeness because it ""doesn't mean anything"".<p>In particular, one important thing clothing does is guide the eye of the viewer. Why are graphic tees unprofessional? Because they are distracting to the viewer. Why are suits professional? Because the details--lapels, tie, collar, padded shoulders--naturally bring the eye to the wearer's head, making him the center of attention.<p>Presentation is important, and affects the perceived content of that which is being presented.

If they leave me with down time that I am eating, I can adjust other project priorities and start the clock again when they are ready.<p>This works out well for both sides because if you get a wishy-washy client that changes everything every two days, they know that they are running the clock, if you are on a time and materials contract. With a fixed price contract, well it's a lot of fighting over whats in or whats out, either that or you eat some time.<p>Conversely, if they are a more laid back client and they are taking time to get back to you, you can stop the clock for them and work on other stuff.<p>When, I used to take fixed price, It created a bad environment in both situations, I felt like the picky micro-managers where riding me for every free cent they could get and I felt like, I was racing the clock, always chasing the laid back guy, so that I could get the project done, as the money was now in the past.<p>Since I set my own personal rule of not fixed price, my client relationships are better, they are getting higher quality work, and they are happy with what they get because it forces the decision on them as to whether the application is good enough for them or whether the want to spend the money, to change the feature, from what they thought the wanted, to what they really want.",1277326171

1456168,comment,1454704,1455235,0,0,sdevlin,,,"I write C# code in Visual Studio every day at work, and I've got some thoughts.<p>Microsoft writes nice tools, and they all work well together. It's a truly integrated environment up and down the stack. And for the simple cases, it's great. I hit F5, and my app runs, right out of the box.<p>But I find the tools difficult to extend, when it comes to it. They are mostly black boxes. This means I'm dependent on MS to add features before I can use them easily. It's possible to write plugins for VS, etc., but I don't get the sense that most people do that. I know I don't. It seems difficult and time-consuming; I'd rather just live with less than ideal behavior.<p>But I've been trying to branch out into other stuff in the past year or so and dabble in different things (app engine, some rails, some C code). What I've noticed is that low level tools like make are cool for a few reasons.<p>First, regardless of its syntax, make is pretty damn simple for the simple cases. Even as a novice, its easy for me to tweak a makefile to suit my needs. I think this simplicity is valuable. By the same token, the generated code for rails is all pretty easy to follow and tinker with. That's not always the case when you pull back the curtain from Visual Studio.<p>Second, make (and others) are orthogonal to the other tools I'm working with. It doesn't matter what editor or framework or languages I'm using. It's pretty easy to whip up a makefile to compile or deploy a dev build or whatever. This is true because steps in a makefile are expressed in terms of terminal commands. Simple and powerful.<p>Third, make is ubiquitous. I think it's pretty cool that I can use the same makefile to deploy my app engine site from Ubuntu or OSX.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that MS's powerful tool set feels oddly constraining to me. I feel much more in control with a set of simple and independent tools, even though I'm much less experienced with them.<p>Just my two cents.",1277323864

PDF capability will certainly be a big plus for iBooks when it comes to the iPad. I'm running the new version on my iPod Touch, but PDFs on such a small screen aren't that useful, at least to me.<p>Frankly, all the readers I've used fall short when it comes to library management.  I want something like iTunes (only better!) both to manage my library and create and manage reading lists.  Right now everything just goes into one big pile that takes _forever_ to scroll through (I've around 800 titles in iBooks and several hundred in Stanza).  iBook on iPad actually has crashed (!) a couple of times as I've gone scrolling from the top of the alphabet to the bottom.  I'll admit I'm pushing iBooks harder, but that's because I expect so much more from Apple ;)<p>The best desktop solution I've found for PDFs (and cbr/cbz comic files) is a comic book reading program called Comicbook Lover.  I use it for PDF management (okay, I manage my digital comic book collection with it too...)  It works very much like itunes. If they would add ePub support to it, and change the name, they could rule the world, at least for a while.  Unfortunately their iPad and iPhone/iPod Touch app is woefully lacking in the very features that make it work so well on the desktop.<p>Edit: And I do a slow burn every time I go to add documents to my iPod Touch or iPad.  Syncing through iTunes is just _stupid_.  I understand this is a problem with _many_ apps on the iOS platform, and that there are political and commercials issues involved, but I don't care.

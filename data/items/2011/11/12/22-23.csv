We also wanted something that a web developer would be comfortable working with - so we looked at JS and decided we could create a variant for performance.<p>We don't give pointers, and we do things client-side like guarded arrays (not necessary on the server).

3229183,comment,3228458,3228935,1,0,tripzilch,,,"Another idea is to substitute the eight BF instructions to different bytes. Right now the byte-values for most instructions are within 1 or 2 values from eachother.<p>You'd need a modified interpreter, though, but by picking different values for the BF instructions, spaced further apart in the 0-255 range, you'd get less collisions (incorrect BF tokens appearing at the wrong spot in your stream).<p>Another possibility would be to pick different code points for each image/message encoded. Though you'd need another channel to specify which 8 bytes encode for which BF tokens. You could even <i>not</i> specify it, but limit the choices for the 8 byte values and try all combinations, then see which ones decode to a string that comes closest to character distribution in English language (this is the same method used by online translators to determine source language, character distribution is highly distinctive).",1321138692

3229159,comment,3228458,3228921,1,0,tripzilch,,,"> This looks like 'snake oil'. What exactly is the purpose of using the brainfuck code instead of the message itself?<p>Hackery, pretty much.<p>> if the message was discovered, then brainfuck does not represent much of an obstacle to reading it.<p>The point of stego is that the message is not suspected. Usually this is done via statistical analysis(1). However, this just tells the adversary that ""a message could be there"". Given that information, they still need to find out which bytes are information-carrying, and that those bytes encode to a BF program. Stego is all about the extra hurdles, it is literal security-through-obscurity. But once they got that, yeah, the message will be exposed.<p>(1) Which is why encrypting the message before stego is not a straightforward good idea, as encrypted data looks like white noise, and contrary to popular belief, the lowest bits in most photos are not distributed like white noise (as a naive stego algorithm would just hide an encrypted message in the image's least significant bits).",1321138290

3229146,comment,3227574,3228694,17,0,bodyfour,,,"Well said.<p>Back in the day, I actually used both the NeXTcube and a BeBox (although neither as a primary environment)<p>The NeXT environment enamored everybody who was introduced to it... for a day or two.  Them almost everybody moved away from it because it was so... damn.. slow.  The base cube only had 8MB of RAM (a decent amount in those days!) which wasn't nearly enough for the big heavy frameworks it used.  NeXT had to retrofit all of the cubes with 40MB SCSI drives <i>just for swap</i>.  The display postscript system was elegant (it provided a common display engine for both the screen and the NeXT-brand laser printer, for instance) but ate up precious cycles of the 68030.  The magnetic-optical drive that supposedly was the future of personal storage had horrible performance (although the drives mercifully gave out after a few years anyway)<p>In short, the NeXTcube's we had were the machines everybody loved but few wanted to actually <i>use</i>.<p>The BeBox by contrast was nothing if not zippy!  There were too many missing bits for it to really be my main environment, but you really felt that you were using the future of operating systems.  After years of using UIs that always had at least <i>some</i> lag the BeBox's instantaneous response was almost a shocking experience.<p>When Apple was quite publicly looking for an OS to buy I was certainly rooting for Be.  It seemed to fit their needs perfectly: it already ran on PowerPC and its responsiveness would have been great for the multimedia creators that were Apple's bread-and-butter.  When they went with NeXT instead I thought it was just another of Apple's classic missteps.  I couldn't see why they were hitching their wagon to an OS that was last decade's news.<p>Clearly I was wrong, even if you ignore the Steve Jobs factor.  The hardware advances underway quickly made the amazing responsiveness of BeOS moot; now every OS feels like the snappy BeBox did in 1995.  As memory sizes grew the NeXTstep frameworks came into their own (probably if the NeXTcube could have had 1GB of RAM it would have been fine!)<p>To put it simply, Be built an OS in 1996 that was perfect for 1996.  NeXT build an OS in 1989 that was suited for the 2000s.<p>I don't mean that last bit as a pure complement, by the way.  The ""too far ahead of its time"" is a cliche about failed tech products.  Building something that only works with hardware 10+ years in the future is hardly a recipe for success.  It's only through the accidents of history that NeXTstep got its chance to shine years after its original failure.  99% of products in that position only get to be footnotes.",1321138007

3229138,comment,3227949,3228114,51,0,sjs,,,"If you asked a friend or searched Google instead of writing your problems here perhaps you would have found the solutions. You took time to learn how to use Linux and the shell, why not take some time to learn how to use OS X as well before complaining that it doesn't do what you want? It does do most of the things you mentioned, and when it doesn't it's by design.<p>Resizing from any side: Legitimate complaint. Fixed in Lion but this was a big annoyance until summer 2011.<p>Maximize: It's not a maximize button. Your expectations don't make it broken. Managing expectations of a new OS is dangerous. It's a big reason why people dislike Linux as well, and it's kind of a shame that people expect everything to behave like whatever they are used to.<p>Finder can access Windows shares, FTP, NTFS, HFS, etc. as well. What are you getting at with this point?<p>You dislike how Apple distributes their build tools. Ok. Maybe some prefer downloading an installer to running aptitude. (I prefer the package manager way as well, but it's just that: a preference.)<p>Finder isn't supposed to be a power tool for people who want to know what's in /usr. Hiding that stuff is the right decision. You said you enjoy the keyboard, fire up a terminal and away you go. Or run the defaults command that enables hidden files in Finder if you really need to click on hidden files all day.<p>Cmd-Shift-G lets you navigate to an arbitrary path in Finder. It has tab completion. You can also run `open /path/to/folder` in terminal. `open .` is often handy.<p>Cmd-left and Cmd-right are beginning of line and end of line navigation commands. You can also use `Ctrl-a` and `Ctrl-e`, standard Emacs shortcuts just like you're used to in the shell. Home and End are Fn-left and Fn-right if you actually wanted Home and End, which behave strangely on OS X. (They go to the beginning or end of a document without changing the position of the cursor, as Cmd-up and Cmd-down do.)<p>Terminal navigation shortcuts: Legitimate complaint. Because option and alt are on the same key you have to use `ESC f`, `ESC b`, etc. to navigate by word. Being a Linux geek you should know that `ESC <foo>` is equivalent to `alt-<foo>`. If you want to go to the beginning or end of line again just use `Ctrl-a` and `Ctrl-e`. (Switch caps lock to control in the Keyboard preferences for maximum convenience and comfort.)<p>It's not locked down or dumbed down, you just didn't take the time or effort to learn it as well as you did Linux. Maybe because you had some preconceived expectation that it was locked down and dumbed down.<p>Linux seems dumbed down to me after 6 years of OS X because standard keyboard shortcuts for navigation in text fields doesn't work. (Ctrl-[abefnp]) And Xmonad and the like seem primitive compared to just adding tiling goodies (Divvy, SizeUp) to a standard WM to get the best of both worlds.<p>Honestly it mostly just comes down to managing expectations and what you are already familiar with. Approach things with a fresh and curious child-like mind and you'll be much happier. Never stop learning, never be afraid to ask how to do something even if it seems silly. Like trying to move the damn cursor to the beginning of the line.<p>Despite my snarky tone I experienced a lot of the frustrations you expressed here. I just dealt with them differently and am happier for it.",1321137781

It's a user who wants to do things their own way, but not bother learning how exactly that is done. I call this mixed-level behaviour - e.g. users who won't use the built-in functionality, but not understand or correctly use the alternative more technical methods.<p>Take the mail example, Mail.app already lets him export his mail box, delete his mail etc. He never needed to rifle through ~/Library to get at it. However if he's tech savvy enough to want to do it the manual way, then he should know how to fire up the terminal to access ~/Library, or more simply by holding the option key and choosing ""Library"" from the go menu. I don't this is breaking osx.<p>While I can't vouch for why he has a magnitude of locked files, given the mail example I have a fair idea of how he's gotten in that situation. While os x does give him the option to gloss past certain locked files. He's likely seeing the error because he's removed files which are ""spoken for"" (i.e in use), these are often located in ~/Library and it's kind of the point of why ~/Library is hidden. Again, if he wants to be tech-savvy, he should just rm the files, or rm the contents of the trash folder. (Or if it was mail.app responsible, just originally remove the mail from inside Mail.app)<p>OSX certainly has some way to go in addressing this kind of mixed level behaviour, but it's not going to stop you from shooting yourself in the foot.<p>About the other features: while I don't appreciate the iOS-ificiation of mac os, it's trivial to turn these learning-curve reducing features off, and on laptops I find they make more sense than they do when using a mouse + keyboard.",1321135648

3229058,comment,3227949,3228740,3,0,ugh,,,"I always thought that the text shortcuts are intuitive and easy to remember. Shortcuts you are used to are always going to be easier to remember than new ones  that is always going to distort your view. I wouldnt put to much weight on that.<p>You navigate text using the arrow keys on their own (characters and lines) or with one of two modifiers: Alt (words and paragraphs) and Command (lines and text fields). If you use no modifiers you are moving around one character (left, right) or line (up, down) at a time. Alt allows you to move from word to word (left, right) or paragraph to paragraph (up, down). Command navigates to the beginning and end of the line (left, right) or text field (up, down). As you can see there is a clear and straightforward hierarchy.<p>People are already used to using the arrow keys to navigate text. The modifier keys do nothing more than what they are supposed to do: The arrow keys still do similar stuff than before, its only slightly modified. This is an excellent example of picking awesome keyboard shortcuts.<p>You can add Shift to any of those combinations to select instead of just moving the cursor. Command-Left moves the cursor the the beginning of the line, Command-Shift-Left selects everything between the current position of the cursor and the beginning of the line.<p>Shift is used for selecting things everywhere, no matter the OS. OS X definitely picks the right modifier for selecting text and everything is still consistent with moving around in text. Anyone who knows how to move around in text can easily be taught how to select text: Its exactly the same, only with Shift.<p>If you use Backspace and Delete (which is Fn-Backspace on keyboards without the Delete key) together with Alt or Command you can delete words or lines respectively (as you would expect).<p>Again, OS X remains consistent. Backspace and Delete work with exactly the same modifiers in exactly the same way as the arrow keys. This behavior is once again easy to teach.<p>This all seems crystal clear to me and Im loving it very much. I think all the key combinations make intuitive sense.<p>I hope I could also explain why I think that OS X is so consistent and intuitive in this regard.",1321135481

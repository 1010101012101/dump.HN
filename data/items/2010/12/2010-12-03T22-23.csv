That is, each of the classes has distinct strengths and weaknesses, but the sum of the strengths and weaknesses is still roughly the same for every character.  This means that there is no ""ideal"" character for beating the game - the ideal character depends on one's play style and the phase of the game one is in.<p>For example, consider the barbarian class and the wizard class.  The barbarian class is great for hack-and-slash players, and is extremely strong early in the game.  However, high initial strength and lack of intelligence means that the barbarian peaks early, and is at a disadvantage later on, when ranged and magic attacks become more prevalent.<p>The wizard, on the other hand, is quite weak at the beginning.  He starts out with few supplies, no armor, and limited magic.  However, his ability to learn new spells and increased skill with thrown weapons means that the wizard becomes quite a powerful character later on, surpassing the barbarian in most cases.<p>These sorts of dichotomies are the sort of thing that really make games like Nethack enjoyable.

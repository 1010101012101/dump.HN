I was originally thinking more along the lines of a flat user model (e.g. any social news site), in which everyone contributes to the whole, rather than a relationship/network-based model, in which certain users interact with other users, but not necessarily the whole (e.g. Facebook, Myspace).",1232732559

This means that we want employers to be able to hire employees to work on innovative projects, but we don't want to discourage employees from working on projects on their own either.  So if this relationship gets out of balance, we could end up stifling innovation from one side of the relationship.<p>Think of it this way... suppose I'm a house flipper.  I mainly do this on my own time, but I do search the web for properties, email friends about investment opportunities, and call mortgage brokers while I'm at work.  It's not a huge time sink, probably no worse than the random goofing off or reading hacker news that goes on at work.<p>I doubt a court would allow my employer to ""own"" my profits from flipping houses.<p>Now say I have a side programming project.  I mainly do this at home on my computer, but occasionally I think about it at work, and I have fixed bugs, sketched out an algorithm, or tested the site at work, and I did write a bit of code on my work supplied computer.<p>In this case, I suspect the courts (IANAL, of course!) would award ownership to my employer, even if the project is unrelated to my work tasks.<p>So basically, the law does encourage programmers to start side businesses in areas unrelated to technology... but don't we want programmers to innovate in their field of expertise?  Personally, I'd much rather see programmers writing innovative applications than flipping houses.<p>I don't have an easy answer for it, because like I said earlier, I also do see a clear need to provide IP ownership for investors employers who are paying employees to innovate.  But I'd draw this line more narrowly - no big surprise, since I am a programmer ""employee"" myself, and these rules would favor me.",1232732558

One common way for people to attempt to gain credibility on that site is to insinuate that they used to be admission officers at some highly selective college. Because the site is ""confidential,"" that is its users use screen names rather than real names, it is often very difficult to verify such claims. It has not escaped my notice that users with chutzpah and a refusal to acknowledge push-back from other users can often be believed by onlookers even when making quite incredible and unverifiable statements. If you think this would be a problem on your site, you might want to think about how to designate verifiably more accurate and honest users in some way that is visible to all visitors.<p>In general, I think the initial seeding of the membership of an online community is very important.

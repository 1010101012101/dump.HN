I&#x27;d counter that by saying that the UK funds universities very poorly (and also caps fees) and still manages to have 3 of the top 10 universities.

Just look at the stats.<p>Take Sweden for example. In the 90s Sweden took 84,000 refugees from the Balkan states, and now they&#x27;re taking another 65,000 from Syria (I think the US took 10,000). Sweden also freely allows immigration from anywhere in the EU, ranks <i>13 places higher</i> than the USA on the corruption index, and has great universities and free higher education for all.<p>Take the UK. The UK ranks better than the US on corruption index (14th) and has 3 of the top 10 universities in the world, with only 1/5 of the US population. Admittedly we&#x27;re being dicks about immigration at the moment, but I&#x27;m not convinced any more so than the US.<p>In short I don&#x27;t think I buy your argument yet.

I don&#x27;t really see a sane behavioral choice here.  TBH I&#x27;m unsure there&#x27;s a sane recommendation to make here that will solve the privacy leak problem without causing significant pain for the internet - knowing when something loaded or failed can be extremely useful.  And besides, if you block onload / onerror handlers, you can possibly just change the POC to use CSP error reporting, and try to timing attack that instead.",1445940082

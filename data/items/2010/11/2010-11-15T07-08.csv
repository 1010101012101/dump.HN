I recommend a clean install of eclipse 3.5.2 with the latest recommended build of scala-ide. Try things out without installing additional plugins except your favorite version control support. I like the refactoring and code reformatting support!<p>I've recently started using the IntelliJ EAP X builds for a personal project in Scala and find it usable and useful too.<p>The maven-scala-plugin is solid and will let you switch between IntelliJ and Eclipse relatively easily. I don't use the maven eclipse plugin but instead ""mvn eclipse:eclipse"" from the command line whenever the pom changes. Using a pom-based build is useful in a production environment especially if you are using/providing components from/for others. IntelliJ has maven support built-in and seems to work well.<p>I've only pushed the IDEs to ~40 source files. Things might start breaking as the projects get bigger.<p>Things are definitely better than they were a year ago and thanks to both the scala-ide and IntelliJ people!",1289807885

Also, let me know if you have any feedback.<p>To answer some of the common questions/feedback:<p>* So far I have been focused on adding content, but now the site needs some sort of filtering to identify the relative value of each cheat sheet and easily find what you are looking for.  I am still exploring different options for this including: page-rank type popularity scores, HN-style up/down voting, or traditional user star ratings.<p>* Every cheat sheet is manually reviewed.  I don't add every single page that calls itself a cheat sheet.  There is definitely a wide range of quality, but this is somewhat inevitable given this is user-generated content aggregated from around the web.  This is not necessarily a bad thing: for example, an obscure topic might only have one single low-quality cheat sheet, but this is still useful and better than no results.",1289807814

1905574,comment,1905004,1905513,0,0,PakG1,,,"I think it can be simpler than that.  It's just about how products are made for China.  Honeywell has an amazing success story in China, and I got to hear their top Asia executive this year at the APCAC 2010 Conference in Beijing, organized by the China chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce.  He noted that China proved that Honeywell couldn't just waltz in with their products, localize a bit, and succeed.  When they tried that approach, they got decimated by numerous copycats because Honeywell products were too expensive and too feature-rich for what China needed.  He said Honeywell's Chinese copycat competitors often said, ""Honeywell created the market and the demand, but we had to provide the supply.""<p>So Honeywell changed tactics and set up R&D centres in China to deeply understand why Chinese companies were buying imitation products instead of Honeywell products, and then create products that were better suited for the Chinese market.  They got a lot more intimate knowledge of the market and for the first time were making major global product design decisions outside of the USA.  Then with their new R&D centres, they were able to make better products at an acceptable price point to the Chinese.  They dominated.  Today, only a few of those copycat competitors remain and are considered a real threat by Honeywell, whereas in the past, there were almost a hundred of them.<p>The approach was so successful, it became Honeywell's blueprint for how they want to enter all emerging markets from now on.  His main point is that you can't expect an emerging market to lap up western products just because they're western.  You need a hardcore local presence doing hardcore local product development, because the market needs will often be unique.  Fascinating story.  He's writing a book about everything he learned, and I'm definitely buying it when it gets released.  I'd put the guy's name down, but I can't remember his name off-hand; have it at home in an APCAC 2010 program somewhere.<p>No doubt local presence helps with guanxi and all that, but I do bet you that as the Chinese economy and market gets more and more sophisticated, guanxi will matter less and less compared to product and service quality.",1289806415

An InnoDB recovery tool named page_parser read their 80G ibdata file and spits out a maze of 16k InnoDB page files organized by an arbitrary index id.<p>There are two internal InnoDB meta tables called SYS_INDEXES and SYS_TABLES which can give you a mapping from table name to PK index id.

You don't have to use them; it's perfectly OK to use, say, kilim or java.util.concurrent, and many do.<p><i>Why not provide both immutable and mutable versions of the same data types?</i><p>The mutable variants of these structures are already there in java.util, and the stdlib is designed to interact well with java interfaces like List, Map, etc. [1]<p><i>Also when writing real-world software, what about the effort required to align the multitude of Java libraries that assume an imperative environment with Clojure?</i><p>I've used nontrivial Java libraries in Clojure: it looks about the same as the Java code, only shorter and with fewer parentheses. Yes, fewer.<p><i>Can these libraries be used easily, safely and with the same performance?</i><p>Yes. Obviously the Clojure parts won't run quite as fast as the Java parts, but interop is complete, concise, and well-designed. InvokeVirtual is InvokeVirtual either way.<p>Meanwhile Clojure makes <i>obvious</i> improvements over CL in reader forms for readability: the vector, set, map, and regex literals make it much easier to write and understand. It may not be as pure as some other Lisps, but it's a competent addition to the family.<p>[1] A property I miss in Scala. :-(",1341528532

A man could make enough money working on an assembly line to support his wife and children, while owning a nice house.

It's all about a blue-collar factory worker who drives a Corvette and a pickup truck and owns a house with plenty of land. Now fast forward to the last 5-10 years in Country music, where you have Hank Williams Jr singing ""Red. White. and Pink Slip Blues"".

It contrasts this with i2z Technology, LLC, - a Marshall, Texas shell entity run by a Silicon Valley lawyer - that invented nothing through its own efforts, that took an assignment of a soon-to-expire 1992 patent in July, 2011, that sued a score of mostly-large companies in the fall of 2011 for allegedly infringing that patent, and that made a letter demand on Hipmunk to take a license from it or be immediately sued. It notes, very pointedly, that the innovation done by Hipmunk from which so many people stand to benefit has <i>no connection whatever</i> with the patent upon which i2z threatens to sue. It further notes that, on the face of it, the primary claim of the patent in issue deals with two-window configurations not even used by Hipmunk. And it identifies prior art that Hipmunk claims invalidates the patent. Finally, the complaint states that this demand came to Hipmunk only after it had raised significant VC funding for the purpose of continuing to grow and to innovate and, rather than use these funds to pay for a worthless ""license,"" it has instead elected to fight to expose this for the bogus claim that it is.<p>2. The themes of the complaint are almost a template for what is wrong with U.S. software patents at their worst. Patents are supposed to protect and encourage innovation. They are supposed to take things that would otherwise remain secret and get inventors to disclose this secret know-how so that it can be absorbed into an ever-broadening public pool of knowledge for society's benefit and, as a trade-off, give the inventor a limited monopoly barring all others from using the invention for a limited time even if those others developed it entirely independently of the efforts of the inventor. To get this monopoly protection, the innovation has to be truly inventive and not such that those skilled in the relevant art would see it as obvious in light of prior art; and it must be practical and useful as applied to real-world activities and cannot be so abstract and vague that it amounts to an idea, a law of nature, or a mere concept. To benefit society, the monopoly protection must extend to a point deemed reasonable for rewarding the inventor but not so long as to give him a windfall at the longer-term expense of others. All of these concepts applied beautifully to an industrial age where inventions tended to be tied to heavy machinery or to other innovation tied to long and expensive development cycles and where the resulting inventions were discrete and significant departures from the analog-style forms of prior art that preceded them.<p>3. Digital technology, when first deployed, tended to fit within the historical patterns but not so with software. When it comes to software development, development cycles have become extremely rapid. The ability, or even the inventor's desire, to keep innovation secret and undisclosed has severely contracted and, in a sense, much of what is innovative in software is an open book, with a whole universe of developers drawing from the same or similar sources and deriving very similar outcomes without reference to one another's work. Change comes quickly and incrementally and knowledge of that change rapidly becomes widespread. Often such changes, when reduced to practice, can only be described in vague ways that might be applied in all sorts of surprising ways to future incremental changes and, hence, the monopoly rights tied to such vagaries hang like a menacing cloud over anything that anybody might do in those areas. And even things that truly might be classified as inventive in light of prior art can be seen as being of very limited value in the broader swirl of rapid technological change within even a few years of the time they are given patent protection and hence giving every appearance of society's having given the inventor a 20-year windfall over what should instead have been incremental stuff worthy of 3-year protection at most. Now add to the mix an underfunded and besieged patent office whose examiners are not particularly qualified to make consistent, astute judgments about innovation involving software and who are effectively under quota-pressure to keep the patent grants moving along in the system - add further an enforcement system that imposes multi-million dollar costs upon those who seek to enforce their patents and also upon those who seek to defend against claims of infringement and that produces widely variable results tied to a jury system in which those passing the ultimate judgment can easily be confused and bamboozled in evaluating technical claims - add further that the appellate review level concerning patents has been placed in the hands of a specialized court having exceedingly close and sympathetic ties with the patent bar and with the idea of broad-based patent enforcement remedies (including potentially crippling injunctions) - add further that a specialized judicial district in a backwater Texas area routinely provides favorable treatment for patent claimants even when claims are weak or frivolous - add further that patent rights, being freely assignable, can be gathered in the hands of shell entities having no connection with any form of innovation but being intimately tied to a system whose purpose is to play the enforcement system to its maximum value in order to force parties to pay up or get swept into a litigation mess - yes, added all together, this becomes one lethal brew whose poisons now maim or kill, rather than encourage, the innovation that the patent system was designed to foster.<p>4. I am by no means hostile to IP rights generally. These can and do protect various forms of creative effort in ways that can benefit society. Still, IP rights when abused are the worst form of perverseness in a technologically-driven society and can and do damage society in serious ways. You wind up with those who have not innovated a day in their lives making debilitating demands on those engaged in brilliant innovation in furtherance of a cynical shake-down process that amounts to a toll on innovation with no offsetting benefits. The patent system has served the U.S. well for over 200 years. Its structure was put in place with the pace and methods of innovation fostered by the industrial revolution. That structure did not envision digital technology as embodied in software and has in the past 20 years become corrupted. It is time for a rethinking of what it takes in the patent area to encourage and protect software innovation. The current system, as exemplified in the Hipmunk case, is absurdly broken.",1341528095

Namely: <i>If it's likely to the point of being almost certain that someone else will soon come up with the same solution, it shouldn't be patentable.</i><p>If inventors are to be rewarded by monopoly grants, it should be for doing genuinely challenging, innovative research, not for winning a foot race to the patent office, as happened with popular technologies like the telephone, or for trying random stuff until you hit the lottery, like Edison did with the light bulb.  We, the public, would not have had to wait much longer for electric lighting if patent protection had been unavailable.

It was not without reason that homeopaths considered the bases of their approach to medical problems to be more logical and more promising than the inherited tradition of the ancients, upon which mainstream physicians still based their practices. [...]<p>This book will be useful primarily to scholars looking for specific information about particular people, events, and developments within the homeopathic movement during the period covered. Among other things, readers will find the namesand often the opinionsof hundreds of previously invisible homeopathic practitioners, publicists, and professors; they will follow fierce debates between the so-called high-dilutionists (whose therapeutic commitment to infinitesimally small doses of supposedly energized substances verged on spiritualism) and the low-dilutionists (who ultimately merged with mainstream physicians in the early decades of the 20th century); they will explore the founding and fate of homeopathic medical schools; they will listen to well-intentioned homeopaths defend themselves against attacks from the American Medical Association; and they will learn about regional variations in the character, reception, and legal standing of homeopathy around the country.""<p>Anyway not to defend homeopathy, but I just find it sad that so many people view James Randi as a credible source despite the fact that he can rarely go five minutes without lying about something.",1341526364

Zero cost.<p>Yes, there are plenty of web-accessible, paid educational material. Many people make good \nbusiness from it (e.g. lynda.com). Zero cost is a differentiator.<p>Also, the paid material is usually vocational (e.g. teaching you how to use photoshop), not physics 101, the kind of material you study in college. I assume that's because college already exists, gives out diplomas so for-profit enterprises don't try to compete with colleges.<p>2. Better lecture format.<p>There are free, high-quality lectures (MIT's OCW etc.) but while the content might be high-quality, the experience is awful. At first I was excited about OCW but just couldn't bear to sit through 1 hr lecture with paltry written notes.<p>Udacity uses the format pioneered by Khan Academy of short videos, has supplemental like exercises and has a clear path from start to finish.<p>3. Systematic approach.<p>Again, compared to previous initiatives like MIT's OCW, Udacity's goal is to provide complete courses. Clearly they are at the beginning of delivering that but I think that we can all agree that their Minimal Viable Product has been very successful, which validates product-market fit, and it's also clear from interviews that Udacity has much bigger goals and they are executing pretty aggressively on them.

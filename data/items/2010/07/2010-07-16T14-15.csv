1521314,comment,1519710,1519882,0,0,mattmanser,,,"Conversely, to me, the reasoning in the piece is extremely flaky. A few examples below:<p>1) The biggest and most obvious one is that the Times has a large amount of oversight already in terms of other papers as well as law. Google has nothing like that, search engines just don't work the same way. You don't get search results compared all the time. That does happen to reporting.<p>2) People tend to consume a variety of reporting mediums, but only one search engine. For example I read the Independent newspaper, the BBC or Guardian websites, on TV watch Question Time, This week (both BBC again admittedly) and Channel 4 news. And on the radio in the morning, news reports. I'm probably a bit more of an outlier, but I would guess many people are exposed to multiple suppliers of news without even realizing it.<p>And for search I use... um, Google.<p>3) The numbers are totally incomparable. How many people in the world rely on the Times' as their exclusive news provider in the world? 1% would be a gross over estimation. And Google for search? 66%.<p>4) Transparency. There is nothing transparent about Google's algorithm, while everything is supposed to be transparent at a paper. A journalist not declaring a vested interest is abnormal, they will even duck out of stories in which the have such an interest. Again, it's about oversight. Remember that hoo-haa a year ago about the massive argument those tech bloggers had on screen about free gear influencing their reports? That would never happen to a search engine.<p>There are many comparable intellectual bloopers in the satire just like this.<p>I've been of the opinion that Google needs some oversight for quite a while, they are getting scarily powerful. While I dislike government interference, the web is too important to leave to a company.<p>At the moment Google is fairly good, but there's no denying it's been favouring its own services at the expense of others.<p>We have nothing to gain in trusting it to regulate itself and everything to lose.",1279292277

This is usually related to poor working environment fit for my personality and personal goals.  I think it is common, particular for corporate devs, to struggle with these types of feelings.<p>I have, by accident and plan (lack of knowing the effects), wound up in a similar place to what you describe.  More directly, I have developed a marketable, but big corporate-focused skill set (RDBMS, Oracle, MS SQL Server, DB2 . . . ).<p>This is OK for now, it works for my geographic region, my family, and so far has been low-risk from the ""I have a well paying job"" perspective, but is completely unsatisfying career-wise from a challenging growth perspective.  I've recently turned down one much higher-paying job than I have now and am struggling with a similar decision at this point for another job.  My main fear is that the new offer represents ""more of the same"" and this website, PG's essays, and a number of other sources have poisoned me forever against living in my safe corporate cube in happiness.<p>Not that this will help how you feel much, but having really good domain knowledge probably has the effect of making you much more valuable than just a ""mediocre programmer.""  Think about those guys that got YC funding, they were <i>teaching themselves to program</i> to implement their idea (can't remember the group, Jessica mentioned them in a Mixergy interview).  It's not like they were super-hackers at that point or anything.<p>If I had your flexibility to quit and move, I'd try to hook up with one of the startups that float around this forum.  I read a number of comments that make me think many of them are small with smart people who want hackers looking to push themselves hard and build stuff in a fun way.

When people in the 90s wrote about the Internet and the Digital Library, quite a lot of them were envisioning something like Google Books, which is just a collection of books, <i>only online!</i> What actually <i>happened</i> was Wikipedia. (And a lot of other stuff, all of which further proves my point, but Wikipedia is sufficient.) Nobody in the 90s but the wildest visionaries saw Wikipedia coming. The Digital Library wasn't just the analog library writ large, it was something new that an analog library could never do.<p>Digital newspapers already exist. They are fed by RSS/Atom and do a variety of exciting things. Adding a top layer of formatting driven by a computer to make Google Reader (or your favorite RSS/Atom consumer) look like a old-style paper newspaper is a waste of time, and even worse, a waste of valuable screen space. Especially if you're going to try to write an algorithm to automatically figure out what the ""top story"" is, which will never be as good as a human. (And as in the first paragraph, there's also a variety of other things, like Slashdot, Reddit, HN, and all kinds of further digital elaborations on the fundamental newspaper template as modified by what digital makes easy and/or possible.)<p>Trying to replicate the old analog way of doing things is just silly.",1279291983

It's the very fact that it's such a complex monster that forces coders to keep it simple, stupid. You don't get that kind of thing out of the box in something like Java.

Having worked in restaurants and going to culinary school, I have had a first-hand opportunity to see the inner workings of these places.  Here are some selling strategies that should work.<p>1. Develop a list of your potential customers.  Keep this local in the short term, so it doesn't overwhelm you.<p>2. Create a 2 page business brochure that has stats about the industry, the problem you are solving and stats about where the industry is heading.  Think infographic.  On page 2 describe how your product meets all those needs, include some scenarios and a lot of screenshots.  This needs to look good, not too technical, not too salesy.  Look at the datasheets from NCR <a href=""http://ncr.com/products_and_services/self_service_kiosks/food_service/ncr_xpress_orderandpay_fs.jsp?dtype=datasheet&lang=EN(at"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ncr.com/products_and_services/self_service_kiosks/foo...</a> a minimum they need to good this good)<p>3. Take the list you created in step one and try and connections in your network of friends to them, linkedin is good for the bigger companies.  For the SME's (small/medium enterprises) you need to think a little harder and maybe even make some calls.<p>4. Start making calls but DO NOT sell on the phone.  People in restaurants don’t have time to talk on phones they have too much crap going on that they can’t be tied to the phone for 30 mins while you pitch. Only ask one question to start ""When is the Chef/Owner/Manager in?"" If you get the Chef/Owner/Manager on the phone ask them when is a good time to come in to talk to them is.  If they ask you why, tell them you want to show them a product you developed for restaurants and you want to spend 5 minutes showing them how it can help.  If they keep probing then try and say as little as possible about your product, focus on asking them questions about the need you are trying to solve.  So if your product is in a new ordering system then ask them when they do there ordering from suppliers, are they happy with that process, etc...<p>5.  Go there in person, be mindful how you look because before you even say a word they will judge you based on appearance.  Don’t dress to formal (so no suit) or too casual (how you would look after 30 hours straight of coding).  Make sure your breath and you don’t stink because people in the restaurant business have keen senses of smell (flavours are 10times smell, 1 times taste).  Hand them a brochure and ask if they have 5 minutes.  Then give them 30 seconds to scan the brochure, you will know based on the look of their face whether you need to continue your pitch or move on.  If the face is blank then it’s a 50/50.<br><p>That’s just the foot in the door, after that you need to convince them to buy your product or service.  And the variability in that is too great to explain without knowing what you are selling.<p>Hope this helps",1279290400

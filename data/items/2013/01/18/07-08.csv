Commenting out bits of code to see what effects it has is one of the most useful ways of not only debugging a program, but learning to program, and reading code.<p>Just because some really smart people made a decision for reasons that are great 99% of the time, but fail badly in a very important 1% case doesn't mean you have to redefine your entire belief system to avoid criticizing them.",1358492631

There are plenty of lefties in the senate who really enjoy killing animals so guns are always going to be legal.<p>What they are trying to restrict is the use of guns as toys and I have zero problem with that. I think hunting is ridiculous and horrible in this day and age but I guess that's part of the compromise I have to do. I am not accepting anything further than that though, guns are not toys.",1358492450

They often select elements (like button to track click on) from whole document by id (and in big app this is pretty useless except for some top-level elements), or interwind templates with bindings to events and interaction between them is structured so that it feels like almost using globals. Directly changing top-level data from some inner template.<p>Anyway, I've got some ideas - display is easy though, what's hard is nicely structuring forms and buttons IMO - but it takes time to carve them out in code. I would love to read something on topic of structuring applications, which are more than a single input and a single list.",1358492432

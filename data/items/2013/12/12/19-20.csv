It is no more costly to &quot;load up&quot; something new than to &quot;load up&quot; what you were working on before once the switch has happened.<p>Now in the real world, where people expect you to do just one thing, I often do multiple two, possibly three, hour stints, with context switches in between each. However, I feel a lot better on the days when I&#x27;m able to do different tasks on each switch rather than coming back to the same task each time. You, naturally, still have to give that task your undivided focus while you are working on it. Trying to manage everything at the exact same time will definitely lead to what you suggest.<p>Of course there are no hard rules.

While that&#x27;s all fine and dandy, you should probably be aware that you don&#x27;t necessarily get a choice as to &quot;subsidize&quot; people who contribute nothing to society because it is possible for people to actually negate things from society, all the way down from petty thugs all the way up to crooked, lawyered-up execs and/or politicians. The difference is that the latter gets to pay their way out of their transgressions to society (often times at a rate that still makes it profitable to rob society) while the former get the societal brunt and blame for society&#x27;s ills.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the former group are saints, but 1) they have systematic disadvantages that actually prevent any current legal implementations of a free market from providing for them and 2) once incarcerated, they actually end up costing society in a far more permanent way (up to $167k/yr in NYC).<p>So, even if you disregarded how totally wrongheaded your argument on a sociopolitical level, it also shows a pretty flimsy lack of substance on a quantitative level.

We, Streak, happenned to launch an email tracking feature on the same day (<a href=\"http://www.streak.com/email-tracking-in-gmail\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.streak.com/email-tracking-in-gmail</a>).<p>Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve learned:<p>- the proxying of requests only happens when a user is viewing the mail inside Gmail (i.e. gmail does not actually affect the message body, its just proxying at render time)<p>- gmail only caches in the image for a few minutes. So for email marketers, if your recipient views the email then views it again a few hours later, the marketer will see two requests for the image<p>- there is basically no personally identifiable information in the request that Google&#x27;s proxy sends to the server hosting the image. So from that perspective this is actually a boost in privacy than the previous state of the world. None of the headers, cache controls, cookies, ip addresses, referrers or user agents are passed to the original image server<p>- obviously you can encode some ID into the image URL itself but all that lets you do is identify the email address of the user that opened the email. But you already had their email address because you sent them an email - so again, no PII gets disclosed<p>- it is true that marketers will see a more accurate count of opens (because displaying images is on by default)<p>- there seems to be several ways to get gmail&#x27;s proxy to NOT cache the image and simply proxy the request every time the user opens the emails",1386875157

Back in 2011 I had a meeting with Eric Schmidt, the then-Chairman of Google, who came out to see me with three other people while I was under house arrest. You might suppose that coming to see me was gesture that he and the other big boys at Google were secretly on our side..<p>The pretext for their visit was that Schmidt was then researching a new book, a banal tome which has since come out as The New Digital Age.<p>..<p>Two months after my meeting with Eric Schmidt, WikiLeaks had a legal reason to call Hillary Clinton and to document that we were calling her. It is interesting that if you call the front desk of the State Department and ask for Hillary Clinton, you can actually get pretty close, and we have become quite good at this.<p>..eventually we got up to Hillary Clinton’s senior legal advisor, who said that we would be called back.<p>Shortly afterwards another one of our people, WikiLeaks’ ambassador Joseph Farrell, received a call back to discuss the parametres of the call with Hillary, not from the State Department, but from Lisa Shields, <i>the then-girlfriend of Eric Schmidt</i>, who does not formally work for the US State Department. So let’s reprise this situation: The Chairman of Google’s girlfriend was being used as a back channel for Hillary Clinton. This is illustrative. It shows that at this level of US society, as in other corporate states, it is all musical chairs.<p>That visit from Google while I was under house arrest was, as it turns out, an unofficial visit from the State Department.&quot;",1386874881

So, expect to waste some time for getting the usefull bits.<p>Some of what I got as actionable info:\n1 - Don&#x27;t trust services. That&#x27;s different from &quot;avoid services&quot;, and very different from &quot;avoid US services&quot;. Some times you can use non-trusted services, other times you can&#x27;t.\n2 - The US is messing with standard crypto. I&#x27;m avoiding eliptical crypto while I understand it&#x27;s history better. I increased some RSA keys, sometimes over the old 2k bits &quot;maximum amount anybody would ever need&quot;. I got some ideas for what to do when you don&#x27;t trust your crypto algos, but I didn&#x27;t need to use them.\n3 - Don&#x27;t trust closed source software. I already knew that one as an abstract thing (just like #1), but it was reveled that it&#x27;s a completely real thing. (Also, now I have facts I can throw at somebody.)\n4 - Don&#x27;t trust your LAN or your hardware. Yeah, the first part is good practice - but easy to ignore. The remaining means that one must evaluate all his data worth, and prepare if needed. Ok, not really an action, unless you have data that isn&#x27;t worthless.",1386874846

Given a day where you tend to seek social interaction vs. a day when you tend to shy away from it, you can get a very different number of (practice) interactions.<p>There&#x27;s a lot that can be learned by paying attention to other people and trying to understand what they&#x27;re thinking. The earlier that someone who&#x27;s not naturally adept at it realizes that this is important to pay attention to, the earlier they get better at social skills. Some of that can be highlighted for little kids while reading (story) books; paying attention to and asking questions about why the characters do the things in their interactions highlights the idea that other people do things for reasons, and that you can guess what they are (the guessing well is a skill).",1400340913

And you probably look better than you think you do, because if you were unpopular in high school you were not &quot;groomed&quot; to be beautiful. So you may not realize how beautiful you actually are.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, here&#x27;s what seems to matter most (in no particular order): Money, self-confidence, and doing something interesting with your life.<p>If you&#x27;re rich, confident enough to ask girls out on dates (comes with practice, &quot;fake it till you make it&quot; is the name of the game here), and you&#x27;re doing interesting things that you can talk about passionately, some beautiful person is going to be with you at some point. It&#x27;s inevitable. Being &quot;good looking&quot; is less about actual physical traits and more about how you carry yourself.",1400340014

Almost any real culture is implicit; it&#x27;s not designed. I think it&#x27;s because growing up watching a lot of cable news, I&#x27;ve learned to be sensitive to narratives that don&#x27;t have a lot to do with reality, and frequently &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;values&quot; are used to try to suggest a narrative to employees that also has very little to do with reality. I don&#x27;t need a culture of &quot;integrity&quot; not to do evil things, I have a conscience. Nor do I need a cultural value of &quot;innovation&quot; to come up with new ideas -- a lot of times the pleasure of doing something well is more than enough.<p>It makes me also think about how uncomfortable I felt during high school rallies. I mean, I didn&#x27;t even particularly choose to be in that place, why should I have &quot;pride&quot; to be part of that institution?

During our lunch break, I was far happier spending my time with a very small group of friends, or sitting on my own with a book. If I had wanted to be &#x27;in&#x27; with the popular kids, I would have had to expend enormous quantities of energy engaging with them, trying to be humorous, attempting to care about their lives.<p>I don&#x27;t think being a nerd in anyway correlates with intelligence. Introverts tend to spend more time in solitary pursuits such as reading, programming and watching movies. For this reason they tend to become highly skilled or knowledgeable in niche areas. Extroverts tend to spend more time socialising and hence develop and excel when it comes to social skills. I&#x27;ve met plenty of stupid nerds in my time, and some stunningly intelligent &#x27;popular&#x27; people.<p>When it comes to sports, I know plenty of introverts who are amazingly skilled. They tend to stay clear of activities such as football or other team sports simply because they are introverts. I have black-belts in Karate and Tae-kwon-do. My brother likes to run marathons (not competitively, he just runs 26 miles when ever he feels like it). Other introverts I know are amazing climbers or paddlers. These activities are all solitary, or rely on one&#x27;s own skill rather than that of team-mates. They don&#x27;t tend to attract the attention of others as much.<p>Introverts don&#x27;t really want to be popular. Introverts also don&#x27;t want to be bullied. Introverts would like some attention from the opposite sex. Introverts would like to be respected for their accomplishments. To gain those things, however, would require socialising on a grander scale than they feel capable of and hence they are branded as nerds.",1400339278

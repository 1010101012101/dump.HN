10961204,comment,10960760,10961168,0,0,jsolson,,,"> Au contraire, rebase can break bisect by creating commits that were never actually tested or compiled. And if your bisection algorithm cannot handle merges, then that&#x27;s a problem with a bad bisection algorithm.<p>This is only true if you allow commits that haven&#x27;t individually passed your CI suite to be pushed. That&#x27;s insane.<p>> Nor does it make history more readable; it makes history more readable in the same sense that inlining all procedures makes a program more readable (i.e. not really).<p>Working at an organization (Google) that for the most part doesn&#x27;t use branches and where other merges are impossible (every file must have previously been resolved against whatever is at HEAD prior to submitting), I respectfully disagree[0]. A linear history of individually reviewed and validated changes is MUCH easier to deal with than the regularly branched/merged history of my previous gig (which did use git, along with pre-push change review for each change).<p>> Merge commits are an abstraction mechanism. You can view a branch&#x27;s history as a purely linear history (git log --first-parent) of normal and merge commits, where merge commits represent the merged branches (and where the commit message should summarize the branch changes properly). You can then unfold merge commits and view the branches they represent in such a quasi-linear fashion, too. Repeat as needed.<p>They&#x27;re a leaky abstraction, though. Unless you mutate published history (which I do think is insane) it&#x27;s inevitable that your nice bundle of merged changes will one day be incomplete: additional changes to make the bundle actually function as intended will be required. These will end up detached from it as some other commit series on HEAD or merged into HEAD. I find it far easier to tie together a series of changes via things like issue tags in the commit than expecting a merge commit to properly bundle things up.<p>[0]: Mind you, Google also for the most part does not use git -- we do our own thing, and with that history is necessarily linear, but I&#x27;ve found I really do prefer it that way.

We do it where I work and it works great.  Every developer submits PRs from feature branches on their forked copy of the main repo, which get merged in after review and testing.  At any time, we can roll back to the previously deployed version of prod if we have to.<p>Mutable history is also nice for these forked repos, since it allows us to squash commits and eliminate any wrong turns we take in the development process, leaving the main repo&#x27;s history cleaner.",1453602416

A more linear history with fewer merges is much easier to bisect as well as to read, generally.<p>Au contraire, rebase can break bisect by creating commits that were never actually tested or compiled. And if your bisection algorithm cannot handle merges, then that&#x27;s a problem with a bad bisection algorithm.<p>Nor does it make history more readable; it makes history more readable in the same sense that inlining all procedures makes a program more readable (i.e. not really).<p>Merge commits are an abstraction mechanism. You can view a branch&#x27;s history as a purely linear history (git log --first-parent) of normal and merge commits, where merge commits represent the merged branches (and where the commit message should summarize the branch changes properly). You can then unfold merge commits and view the branches they represent in such a quasi-linear fashion, too. Repeat as needed.<p>This can also guide a bisection algorithm (bisect along git log --first-parent, descending down the merge hierarchy as necessary) and is generally more readable if presented properly (that Git doesn&#x27;t have a tool other than git log --first-parent for this is a different story). Conversely, a fully linearized history is longer and lacks any structure (as I said, it&#x27;s like manually inlining all procedures in a piece of code).",1453601942

I put as much as possible into 401k, which I advise everyone reading this to do. I own a home, purchased a decade ago, which costs me maybe $3K a month (it&#x27;s hard to estimate exactly because mortgage interest is tax deductible to an extent).<p>My title is something like Senior Software Engineer (but titles don&#x27;t matter very much). I do mobile apps. I used to do desktop apps and server stuff but about 6 years ago, mobile seemed like a very big growth market, and I was right. Right now I work for one of the big companies, but I&#x27;ve gotten this pay rate or close to it at startups. There&#x27;s the funny thing about startups -- they need you, but they don&#x27;t want to pay what you&#x27;re worth so they offer stock, but the stock is usually worthless, and then at the end of the day they really need you. So it&#x27;s really about knowing yourself and your worth. In my experience, sites like glassdoor do not have accurate salary information for the top end. They are probably ok for average jobs, but at my level, they are completely off. The way you&#x27;ll get the right info is by making friends with people like me and buying us a few beers... and on sites like this.<p>How long would it take to learn ... well, depends where you start. I&#x27;ll assume nothing about you. Knowing all the fundamentals is really, really important -- data structures, algorithms, and at least a couple languages. I went to a top 10 university, but you could learn all of that stuff with a few books and some study.<p>Then pick some specialization. I happen to know a lot about graphics, I&#x27;ve done lots of UI, and so I focus on front-end stuff, and so I do mobile which is pretty specialized and very hot now. But there are plenty of other in-demand specializations that can serve you very well, so I&#x27;d advise picking something you enjoy, because you&#x27;ll be doing it a lot. I learned mobile stacks by reading a lot (and it&#x27;s all free, on the internet!), doing my own projects on the side, and once I knew enough, getting other people to pay me to learn more.<p>Then it&#x27;ll take you anywhere from 1-10 years to practice that specialization enough to master it. Now, in programming, mastery doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean what it does in say kung-fu. It means knowing enough of an API, and the available tools, to be really productive. It also means being able to prioritize work (e.g. use top down design) in order to deliver on time and with high quality/low defect rate.<p>If you were smart, learned fast, and didn&#x27;t mess around too much, you could learn everything I know in a couple of years. If you did I&#x27;d be insanely jealous, but not really, I&#x27;d actually be very impressed and respectful, and I would want to hire you.<p>I am not scared of competition. I&#x27;ve worked with many really, really amazing and smart people over the years, and there is plenty of work out there. My own company is hiring, I know lots of companies are too, and it&#x27;s a great time to be alive.",1453600950
10961126,comment,10953766,10959164,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;Citations please. This is the second time I&#x27;m asking.&quot;<p>I was giving you no references, only stuff you could Google, because you opened with an insult. I don&#x27;t do homework for people that do that. That said, I think I figured out where this really started:<p>&quot;by someone who says that &quot;performance assertion showed he was full of crap&quot;... which I have demonstrated isn&#x27;t true&quot;<p>This assertion <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> about M:N or STM. Those came way after the performance assertion. In his third paragraph, he tried to dismiss unikernels with a blanket assertion about [basically] how their performance can&#x27;t be good enough. Sums it up as saving context switches isn&#x27;t enough, as if that&#x27;s supporters&#x27; key metric. Other commenters wanted actual <i>data</i> on different types of unikernels and alternatives supporting his assertion. Instead of providing that, he says &quot; let’s just say that the performance arguments to be made in favor of unikernels have some well-grounded counter-arguments and move on.&quot;<p>Seriously? He just opened a counter to unikernels by saying their bad performance makes them worthless compared to alternatives like his, gives context-switches as a counterpoint, and then asks the reader to just take his word otherwise that there&#x27;s a good counter to anything they&#x27;d ask? Unreal... How could I not look at it as either arrogant or propaganda piece after that?<p>That was the performance assertion some others and I we&#x27;re talking about. That&#x27;s what I meant when I said &quot;plus&quot; the performance assertion. I can see how it could be read like it was connected to other two. The M:N and STM claim I made came from this sweeping statement he did for show far as I can tell:<p>&quot;the <i>impracticality of their approach for production systems</i>. As such, they will join transactional memory and the M-to-N scheduling model as&quot;<p>That was outside his section on performance toward the end after he talked about all kinds issues. So, he just says they were impractical for production systems. Despite being used in production systems beneficially. Not for ultra-high performance, like you said, but delivered on claims in some deployments and not purely a fad. So, he doesn&#x27;t substantiate his prior claims on HN when asked (with references supporting counters), his opening claim there, and doesn&#x27;t qualify those two. So, I called him out on all of it with the assumption this is an ego or ad piece more than any collection of solid, technical arguments. Only debugging claim really panned out and only partially.<p>I think we just got to talking cross-purposes from then on where the discussion conflated what the performance assertion was with my gripe about his overstatemetns on other two technologies. So, I&#x27;m dropping that tangent from here on now that I see what happened. Pointless as I don&#x27;t disagree with <i>your</i> performance assertion about two technologies so much as <i>his</i> unsubstantiated assertion about unikernels and overstatements about two technologies. So, I&#x27;m done there.<p>Far as my original comment, we&#x27;re still waiting on him to back up that performance assertion he made that unikernels provide no performance advantage despite reports to contrary from users. I&#x27;m also waiting for his security claims on OS vs hypervisors as I&#x27;ve seen more robust, even formally-verified, hypervisors than OS&#x27;s in general with <i>ZERO</i> verified or secure UNIX&#x27;s. Merely attempts. I&#x27;ve got citations going back to the 70&#x27;s supporting a minimal-TCB, kernelized model as superior to unrestrained, monolithic kernels in security. Love to see what his counterpoint is on that. Well, counterpoints given the volume and quality of evidence on my side. :)",1453600929

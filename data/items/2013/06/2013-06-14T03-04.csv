5878190,comment,5876108,5876108,5,0,pvnick,,,"The Guardian &quot;backwalk&quot; actually <i>VALIDATES</i> our worst fears, albeit with technical nuances to ensure legality. It&#x27;s really just about the only viable way to implement this absent an SSL encryption crack (I would guess they&#x27;re dumping encrypted communications from Room 641A waiting for an encryption weakness to be discovered, that way they&#x27;ll have <i>everything</i>). As Snowden said, you could wiretap the president if you have a personal email.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works (this is my opinion as a web developer, not verified details from Snowden leak):<p>1) Fancy user interface developed by Booz Allen Hamilton. Enter email address (good choice for a unique identifier, used as unique key in many databases).<p>2) Backend uses curl to send a request to NSA-certified web api on each service shown on the slide. This serves as a legally-binding FISA request either regarding a foreign agent - no court order required - or a domestic agent - secret FISA court order required (see <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2013/06/13/191226106/fisa-court-appears-to-be-rubberstamp-for-government-requests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2013/06/13/191226106/fisa-court-appears-t...</a>) and assumed to be fulfilled by the api.<p>3) Kick off NSA equivalent of gearman worker that checks contents of &quot;dropbox&quot;-like service from each company for updates.<p>4) Services (Google, Facebook, etc) automatically grant request without question as it is a legally binding FISA order. This saves them a ton of money and, hey, it&#x27;s legal! They have some custom code that allows them to look up a user by their email address - almost guaranteed to be indexed in their database - join it to relevant data sets, and dump it to the &quot;dropbox&quot;-like system.<p>5) Fancy frontend shows progress bar, while skinny backend compresses retrieved data into zip file for easy download.<p>This is the most efficient, cost-effective way to do this without venturing into science fiction, ie storing a mirror of all the data which would be stupid on NSA&#x27;s part. It still verifies our worst fears and answers the question as to how such a program can cost &quot;only&quot; $20 million per year as reported by the slides.<p>The trick is in the legal framework, not the technical details. This is why the FISA courts are secret.",1371182321

5878161,comment,5876108,5878014,3,0,leoc,,,"I would be slow to assume that anything is known for certain in this kind of &quot;spook biz&quot;. I also don&#x27;t assume that everything interesting has been released on the slides already. (For example, there&#x27;s interesting reporting in the first Guardian story about what happened to FISA 702 request rates since PRISM was introduced which includes quotations from the slides, but hasn&#x27;t got much attention seemingly because the relevant slide or slides have not been reproduced yet.) However, there a couple of things that make me fairly confident Greenwald is (or was? I&#x27;m not sure if he is still standing by his claim) wrong about this.<p>One is that AFAIK the Guardian and the WaPo both have access to all the same materials Greenwald has, and they have both been backing away from the NSA-has-root claim for some time. But an even bigger factor is how Greenwald defended his claim. If he&#x27;d said &quot;there&#x27;s still-unreleased material which proves me right, hold tight&quot; that would be one thing. But instead he quoted the &quot;collection directly from the servers&quot; text and linked the new slide it came from, implying that the quotation unambiguously ruled out the drop-box/API interpretation and supported the NSA-has-root interpretation. But in fact &quot;collection directly from the servers&quot; is not at all unambiguous between the two interpretations. And even worse, the You Should Use Both slide, which Greenwald produced as his trump card, provides context which clearly undermines the NSA-has-root interpretation! In that slide it&#x27;s clear that &quot;collection directly from the servers&quot; is being contrasted with upstream collection of IP data from the telcos. The fact that Greenwald evidently didn&#x27;t pick up on this himself is pretty clear evidence that his understanding of the presentation is imperfect, whether because it&#x27;s being distorted by his desire for a bigger and more damning scoop or just impeded by a lack of technical savvy.",1371181777

We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.<p>If Google received one of these broader requests, wouldn&#x27;t they have had to comply with it?

Unfortunately that means no Roadsters, for reasons involving AC-vs-DC charging (c.f. Q&A at the 2013 shareholder&#x27;s meeting).  You also only get the supercharger gear for free with your car if you buy one 85kWh models (which does necessarily not mean the most-expensive...  85kWh models start at $72.4k but go up from there, into six-figure territory).  If you buy the cheapest Model S, at $63k, you can pay an additional $2k to buy the equipment necessary to use the superchargers.<p>Model Xs will have a similar situation, I think.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet seen a commitment that the &quot;third-gen&quot; cars (currently touted as aiming for a $30k price-point, though we shall see in a few years), but it&#x27;s certainly how Elon talks about it.  He&#x27;s also said that OpEx on the supercharger stations is very very low: little or no rent, little or no power costs.  And it&#x27;s obvious that a major goal for him is moving personal transport off of fossil-fuel; charging at home off the grid doesn&#x27;t _actually_ achieve that, but giving away solar-powered juice at stations does.  So we&#x27;ll see.<p><snark>

They have recently discovered that only the core of the molecule is necessary for antibiosis, and removal of the rest of the molecule improves its pharmacological properties.  It&#x27;s a distinct molecule, created by the scission of 3 covalent bonds.  Should it be unpatentable?  Almost certainly, somewhere in nature, there has a thiostrepton molecule that by accident happened to have been cleaved at exactly the right places to render the molecule.  does that change your opinion?<p>I am not trying to defend the practice - I abhor patents - but a lot of people are letting their emotional reaction to &quot;patenting genes&quot; get in the way of a dispassionate and informed analysis of what actually is going on here.",1371180073

In a nutshell the north is poor and south is rich and full of international tourism.<p>It&#x27;s something weird of Argentina as a country, 50% of the population lives only in the capital, Buenos Aires. The capital has always had a lot of power (they used to have access to the only port of the city, so they kept ALL the taxes money, while all other provinces received none and were not allowed to have a port).<p>So, only people in Buenos Aires were rich, everyone else was poor, what made the south &quot;not poor&quot; is the fact that basically nobody lived there (because of &quot;La conquista del desierto&quot; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Desert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_the_Desert</a>), people moved south from Buenos Aires to find new customers, find new oportunities and just avoid the &quot;city life&quot;.<p>Also, the south is full of international tourism, cities like Bariloche are full of immigrants and a beautiful Apine-styled architecture, tourists and outsiders are treated quite nicely :)<p>The north on the other hand has a very native south american culture as there are a lot of immigrants from Bolivia and Peru which have a strong native south american lineage, people is closed-minded and isn&#x27;t really used to outsiders.",1381643779

How many other philosophies and religions do you know that try to explain all and -do- claim to have all the answers or have proponents who claim that every truth can be found within their corpus?  I did come away believing that Laozi had captured the fact that any all-inclusive truth is ineffable, something that can be logically reinforced by studying paradoxes such as Russel&#x27;s paradox and self-reference.<p>To sum up the paradox.  Define a set of all sets.  The set itself is a set, so in order to be the set of all sets, it has to contain itself.  Writing a program to create this set will obviously never terminate because any result must be put inside the result, so there can be no final result.  Cool resolutions to many problems of natural thought that would otherwise spiral off into infinity.

The results surprised him and convinced him that outright grants are the best way to give aid.<p>> The program, funded by a loan from the World Bank, was designed to boost the Ugandan economy after 20 years of civil strife by encouraging young peopleages 16 to 35to move from agriculture to skilled trades. The grants were only about $400 per person, the equivalent of a years income for most people in the area. To get the cash, applicants had to form a group with others in their village and submit a proposal showing how they planned to use the money, but there was no follow-up to make sure they used it for that purpose.<p>> Grant recipients became carpenters, metal workers, tailors and hair stylists. Some of the moneyabout 10 to 20 percentwent for training, either at an institute or as an apprentice to a local artisan, but most of it was used to purchase tools and raw materials.

Scott would put it, made legible. In a society that hides the real mechanics of exploitation and sees all social phenomena through the lens of individualism, it is assumed that the poortheir genetics, their habits, or their culturemust be the true cause of poverty.&quot;[1]<p>Specifically with respect to your point about drugs:<p>&quot;Reports such as the National Survey of Drug Use and Health suggest drug abuse among welfare recipients is hardly widespread. Many states have tried drug testing for welfare recipients with practically nobody testing positive. In Arizona, for example, in 2012, after three years and 87,000 screenings, one person had failed a drug test. Utah&#x27;s drug screening program spent $30,000 on testing and only 2.5% of recipients turned out positive for illicit drugs. Florida&#x27;s program had the same results.<p>&quot;In all cases, the testing -- which assumes all welfare recipients are druggies -- cost much more than the savings in welfare payments.&quot;[2]<p>We need to stop acting paternalistically toward the poor and, instead, treat them as people who are capable of making their own decisions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7593829M/The_Soft_Cage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7593829M/The_Soft_Cage</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/30/opinion/granderson-michigan-welfare-bill/index.html?hpt=hp_bn7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/30/opinion/granderson-michigan-we...</a>",1381640594

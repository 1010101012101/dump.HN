The biggest problem is of course interoperating with existing language/development ecosystems. I have pondered in the past about a language or platform where everything is stored internally as some form of AST, and text is just one of the possible representations. It would at least solve the coding-style (well, the formatting part at anyway) issue for once and for all; everyone just maintains their own CSS/XSLT-alike transforms with tabs or spaces and brackets and semicolons wherever they like.<p>I've come across occasional research projects in 'structural editors' which only allow semantically correct input (and, depending on the size of the input alphabet, can function through almost 100% autocomplete menu input)<p>Anastasia[1] is one that I know of, and this <i>Modeless Structure Editing</i> by Sufrin et al.[2] looks interesting.<p>The main issue I can see, apart from the effort involved, is how to deal with incomplete documents, since almost by creation or editing process will have interim invalid structures. Emacs paredit can be pretty infuriating if you don't use its specialised operations and try to edit your code in a way that malforms the structure.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/anastasia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/anastasia/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bernard.sufrin/edit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bernard.sufrin/edit.pdf</a>",1362182252

Most of the notes that doctors write have repetitive structures.

Eye contact is important during patient interviews.  Therefore, most doctors use paper and type them into the EMR later (waste of time).<p>A lot of people (and companies like drchrono) think that the way forward is to use tablets like the iPad mini or the Galaxy Tab, which balance the intrusiveness of the computer form factor against the ability to enter data.

This is exactly the problem with ""social"" games. These games are lousy exactly because the lousy features make them money. With the direction that Facebook is going, it seems to be a service where users volunteer to receive spam. I do not think any company in this position is setup for long-term success.<p>On a philosophical note, I have always felt that Facebook is just a slot machine company. They make a fancy box that takes advantage of the weaknesses of the human brain (obsession with novelty, gossip, and visual stimulus) to keep users doing an activity for much longer than required to get the benefit of that activity. I could be radical and say that I think Facebook delivers no value to its customers and that most people end up actively regretting the time they spend on Facebook (I think it is uncontroversial to say that no one goes to bed wishing he had spent more of his day on Facebook), however there is always someone with a story about reuniting with a long-lost elementary school friend due to Facebook. Nonetheless, even if this value does exist, in no way does it justify the amount of time most Facebook users spend on the site nor does it describe the majority of user activity. This is not to say that Facebook is doomed any more than Las Vegas is doomed, but maybe people will wise up and be more careful about how they spend their time...<p>A bit of anecdote: I have noticed people on reddit commenting that they now use reddit more than Facebook as all the good content on Facebook is just copied from reddit. If reddit had some kind of social interface, it might move aggressively into this market.",1362180118

In V8 and Dart and .NET, code gets compiled to native code as soon as possible. I think that's the best case scenario in general. You then don't have to guess as much.<p>The author didn't mention method dispatching. I think it's an issue for many languages. In Dart, they tried to optimize it by the specification by mostly eliminating the need to change methods at runtime. In Ruby I watched a video by one of the core Ruby developers and he said that in Ruby method dispatching can be very complicated requiring up to 20 steps to resolve them.<p>As important as getting the best performance out of programs is to get the programs created in the first place. That's why I'm against shying away from larger codebases. I'm in favor of OO programming exactly because I think getting things done comes first, even if that could complicate the implementation of the toolset. And OO is all about layers of abstractions that bring more performance costs with them.<p>That said, I absolutely abhor type annotations. They make code hideous and decrease the opportunities for experimentations. Instead of reading a + b = c algorithms, you may need to parse A a + B b = C c source code.<p>In Dart we have Optional Types. But the core developers are fond of type annotations, so most samples they post come with them. I take relief in being able to omit type annotations while experimenting, researching and ultimately prototyping. Although in a way I feel like a rebel in the community for this disregard. Thankfully there is this chance to share a community with them.<p>Reading the part that you don't like adding heuristics to help programs to go faster reminded of adding types to them even if they are mostly disregarded as in Dart.<p>Then again, not all ""dynamic languages"" are the same. Some are truly dynamic with eval and runtime method changes. Others, not so much. Sometimes the tradeoffs allow for other kinds of gains that could come into play like when deploying. So there is a lot more to it than just getting the algorithms correct.",1362179740

He told me a similar story that happened to him later in life when he finally owned his own studio.<p>There were clients that would always insist on making audio adjustments, for no good reason at all.  They were paying to have their music professionally mixed, yet still insisted on making adjustments and changes.  Finally my dad and his friend came up with a great solution.<p>Mind you this was prior to everything being digital, so what they did was they had a massive 24 track. (a really big machine where you can individually adjust the sound of each track)  Well what they did was installed a knob that looked just like the other ones in the track, but placed it a bit lower and near to where the client would be sitting.<p>The client was then told they can adjust the ""openness"", or the ""richness"" by adjusting this rotating knob to a particular setting (remember, the knob does nothing, and isn't connected anywhere).  My dad said clients would spend hours adjusting this knob until they got it ""just right"", and would make sure to let everyone know in the studio that knob was dialed in and to not touch it.<p>It's amazing how many silly things people have to do in all walks of life to placate the ignorant.",1362179204

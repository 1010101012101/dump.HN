The biggest benefit: I learned a lot about server administration, stuff that gives me an edge when doing development. I also learned a lot about operations.

Trading climate change on futures markets does not mitigate it, unless those futures are somehow tied to something else that would cause them to be priced in (like a carbon tax, or tradable emissions caps). To remove it as an externality, you have to somehow price it into the products that are causing the problem, either via decentralized consumer action, or via centralized governmental action.<p>I'm skeptical decentralized consumer action will succeed, and I agree that much of it is poorly targeted, but it's at least the right idea of how to tackle things: if something is not priced in, you have to take action that will force it to be priced in somehow, like preferring one product to another, boycotting some products, banning products, or internalizing the externality via a tax/fee.

So one way or another you need to include child care costs: food and necessities for the primary carer, or day care/nanny costs.<p>I think that a lot of parents end up spending more than they need to with their children because they pander to their food requests.

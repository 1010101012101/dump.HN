The question is whether they (or something like they), would have existed at all.<p>Once granted, a patent give a benefit to the inventor, as well as a cost to society at large: monopoly.  I think it is fair to say that the costs of monopoly always exceeds the benefits: you can&#x27;t justify having the society as a whole pay such a cost for the benefit of a lone entity.<p>The only way to justify such a cost to society, is an equivalent benefit <i>to society</i>.  If it turns out an invention would not have existed without the patent then the patent may not be that bad.  But if would have existed anyway, then the patent is a net cost —bad.<p>Reading my sibling comments, it seems H.264 and MP3 patents were not instrumental in the coming of those technologies (efficient audio and video compression).  Those technologies would have been invented anyway.  Which means these patents didn&#x27;t serve any real purpose, and their costs (monopolies) are therefore unjustified.<p>In a word, Bad.",1410608940

8312138,comment,8309490,8312116,1,0,throwawaykf05,,,"1. Independent invention may be common, but <i>simultaneous</i> independent invention is very rare. Look at the few dozen examples on wikipedia and compare that to the millions of inventions throughout history. In fact the USPTO moved to a first-to-file regime precisely for that reason -- less than a fraction of a percent of patents were involved in interferences. (An interference is a case of simultaneous independent invention at the PTO.) Reinventing something years after somebody already has is no great feat.<p>2. There is no empirical evidence that the &quot;cost of monopoly to society is too large&quot;. In fact there are tons of economic and historical studies that clearly show the benefits of patents by comparing metrics before and after patent systems were introduced. There are also studies that show the costs these systems impose. It is, however, impossible to say if the costs outweigh the benefits because the metrics used are largely orthogonal.",1410608787

8312114,comment,8309490,8311780,3,0,pluma,,,"This is a false dichotomy.<p>If someone makes such an invention, there is no incentive to keep it perfectly secret (i.e. hide it in a filing cabinet and make no use of it that might hint towards its existence) -- other than sheer paranoia or vanity.<p>Instead they will either sell it like any other trade secret or make use of it. If they make use of it and it gives them a notable advantage over competitors, the competitors will seek to either reverse engineer the invention or invest in finding something that works equally well or even better. If the competitors succeed, the original invention becomes obsolete (rendering knowledge of it less valuable) or common knowledge.<p>What&#x27;s more, a competitor or a non-commercial organization might decide to publish their findings for various reasons ranging from harming the original inventor by eliminating their advantage to benevolence / publicity / &quot;fostering innovation&quot;.<p>In the current situation a lot of patents are flat-out useless to anyone but the holder. They either describe something that is blindingly obvious (&quot;X on a computer&quot;), something that is already common knowledge (but nobody bothered patenting before) or that is so vague the description itself is worthless to anyone seeking to copy the idea when the patent has expired.<p>Patents are supposed to be a fair deal between the public and the applicant: the applicant is offered legal protection to maintain a monopoly in a technology they created for a limited amount of time but in return they have to disclose their technology so anyone can copy it once the protection expires.<p>If you take away that benefit to the public, it&#x27;s just a blessed monopoly that can be used to extort anyone who independently comes up with the same idea (or shares the same common knowledge on which it is based). Even with that benefit to the public most software patents would still be harmful because of their insane longevity -- the software industry is disrupted on a monthly, weekly or even daily basis, but patents can be maintained for more than a decade.<p>What&#x27;s so bad if software patents were abolished? Copyright would still exist. Trade secrets would still exist. Trademarks and trade dress would still exist. NDAs and other legally binding agreements would still exist. At this point the benefits of software patents are theoretical at best -- every single tech company out there could potentially be sued into oblivion if they were to pop up on the radar of a patent troll. Patent infringement has become SOP for software companies -- not because they don&#x27;t care about other people&#x27;s IP but because it&#x27;s simply impossible to license every single &quot;invention&quot; your company uses (and let&#x27;s not get started on what the situation looks like for contractors).",1410607791

They are intrinsically tied to trichromacy, by combining only three frequencies of light in different proportions. RGB.<p>It&#x27;s <i>mathematically possible</i> that a continuous spectrum of light also wouldn&#x27;t pick it up, if its only effect was that different combinations of frequency that appear identical to an ordinary person could be distinguished. (Not that this would confer any evolutionary advantage.)",1410606496

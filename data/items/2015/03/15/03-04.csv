How many people are actually going to go through the effort of setting this up and running it? And keep it running? And put up with inevitable bugs? And updating it? How well can it inter-operate with other types of services? While they&#x27;ve gone above and beyond to document a contribution policy and use GitHub Issues, is it only possible to add a feature by hacking on a huge, monolithic project?<p>I don&#x27;t know the best path forward, but it seems like the first few questions could be addressed by something like sandstorm or docker.

9205284,comment,9203874,9203874,0,0,fernly,,,"I find the analysis of the popular attitudes toward work very resonant. We (as a society) do treat the unemployed or unemployable as morally suspect. We do punish people for needing welfare. Many receive the idea of Basic Income with suspicion nearing to revulsion not on economic grounds, but on moral grounds: people would use it to &quot;be lazy&quot;.<p>This, I think, is a particularly telling summary of the connection between Christian doctrine and attitudes to work: &quot;The underlying idea is that you’re endlessly undeserving – that reward, ie happiness, will always be contingent on the endurance of some unpleasant activity (eg “hard work”). Again, we could trace this notion to early moral ideas – eg original sin and redemption through suffering ...&quot;<p>However I see two shortcomings in this essay. First, he doesn&#x27;t make what should be the obvious economic connection. True, any job has value; this is evident from the fact that the employer pays for it to be done. There is a market in labor. However, the religion-derived morality that makes it deeply wrong not to work tends to drive down the price of labor. People will accept shittier jobs for lower wages than they would otherwise, when they also accept the belief that it is evil to be unemployed, and virtuous to have work regardless of the type or satisfaction of the work.<p>Thus the societal attitudes ably described in the essay serve the interests of the employers and work against the interests of the workers. If the workers didn&#x27;t buy into this zeitgeist, they might not not-work, they might even work the same shitty jobs, but they would be more willing to drop them, and would demand higher pay in line with the shittyness. The necessary jobs would still get done (ya want fries with that); but the employers would have to pay more and provide better conditions because the workers would feel morally free to be more choosy about pay and conditions.<p>The second thing wrong with the essay is that it ends without even sketching a solution, or a direction that society might take if &quot;antiwork&quot; gained traction. It seems to be an empty term.",1426391141

9205279,comment,9202858,9205026,0,0,dalke,,,"I view it as two different things.<p>There are many optimizations which work on a simple machine model that hasn&#x27;t changed much since the VAX. There&#x27;s memory with constant time lookup, some registers, and assembly code.<p>Real hardware changed long ago. As a simple example, on traditional hardware it&#x27;s best to save and re-use intermediate values, but on modern hardware RAM lookup is so slow that it can be faster to recompute rather than doing a random lookup. An optimizing compiler isn&#x27;t going to do much if the code wasn&#x27;t designed to match the hardware, or expects a different hardware model.<p>While lowering the impedance mismatch between two systems, whether it be two different languages as in your example, or serialization/deserialization, or call thunking, belongs to an old and well-understood set of optimizations which are nearly insensitive to the machine model.<p>RAM lookup, and cache performance, and cache lines, are important for high performance code. Though as the abstract says, most people only work with &quot;freezingly cold&quot; code, so aren&#x27;t aware of the limitations in the conceptual machine model vs. the actual machine. Fixing this almost always requires deep changes to the code, which an optimizing compiler can&#x27;t do.",1426390855

At the time, mathematicians began running into paradoxes which existing theories could not properly address, including Russel&#x27;s Paradox.<p>In response, mathematicians developed a set of formal axioms (nowadays most people use ZFC, although sometimes Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel and other variations are used) which produce a mathematical foundation that is consistent (i.e. free of paradoxes/contradictions).<p>However, as Gödel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorems demonstrated, there is no set of foundational axioms which are both consistent (free of contradictions) and complete (all mathematical truths can be deduced by such a system).<p>So, while it is true that mathematical proofs are formally valid deductions from a set of axioms, it is worth recognizing that the relationship between mathematics and truth are somewhat more complex than they seem. As it stands, there are an infinite number of mathematical statements that cannot be derived by an axiomatic system. Some philosophers have even sought to identify &#x27;quasi-empiricism&#x27; in mathematical thought [1].<p>And if you find that interesting, you&#x27;ll love James Conant&#x27;s paper on Logically Alien Thought [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-empiricism_in_mathematics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-empiricism_in_mathematics</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/conant/Search%20for%20Logically%20Alien%20Thought%20-%20clean%20searchable%20copy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/conant/Search%2...</a>",1426389192

I really wish we could replace our 12 years of mathematical education, which I think is overall quite useless[2], with 12 years of linguistic education. If we spent 12 years learning how all of the world&#x27;s languages work, I also think we would go a long way to reduce xenophobia and racism. [3]<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I don&#x27;t want people to learn how to speak correctly. I want people to expand their innate curiosity for just how goddam smart humans are at languages. Like the article said, the unusual thing isn&#x27;t that we can&#x27;t keep lie/lay/lied/lain/laid straight, but that we can keep almost everything else straight. Language is a unique human phenomenon. We have opposable thumbs, but so do monkeys, and elephants are quite handy (haha!) with their trunks. Even a raven can use tools, but no other animal exhibits the breadth of ability of language that we do. Birdsongs are complicated and maybe even culturally transmitted, but they can&#x27;t be used to dictate laws or record writing or persuade others as I am now trying to persuade you.[4]<p>Linguistics is a science: it proceeds by gathering empirical data of how humans speak, then formulates hypotheses that will predict how they will speak, and confirms or denies these hypotheses. What more interesting object of study than ourselves! Language is something we all do on a daily basis, spontaneously, naturally. Ever wondered why we do it the way we do it?<p>Sadly, the beauty of this science is clouded behind the way it is taught today in schools, along with a jargon that further distances some of us from the actual object of study. To the prescriptivist grammarians, I say their objective is as futile as trying to educate ants on architecture: ants will build anthills as they see fit. But for the jargon, I am sad to say that some of it is inevitable, because we need the lens of analysis and classification in order to see the true attraction of our linguistic abilities.<p>Transitive or intransitive verbs don&#x27;t occur only in English: virtually every human language has something like them. Participles are less universal, but they are also not a uniquely English phenomenon. But why does this happen?  Why does every known language have verbs but only some has participles? Why do humans craft languages as they do? Therein lies the science! (or lays?)<p>So, try to learn some linguistic jargon. Underneath it lies a very interesting set of concepts that describe an ability that uniquely characterises our species. :-)<p>----<p>[1] The language log is a good place to start finding interesting things:<p><a href=""http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/</a><p>[2] Particularly when calculus is the ultimate goal of elementary mathematical education.

It used to be subsidized by advertising revenue and classifieds and whatnot. Part of it was a loss leader, but it&#x27;s not like people in the pre-Internet age had better taste than we do. I suspect that one of the functions of good investigative journalism is prestige and a &quot;halo effect,&quot; where having high quality content under your brand name helps make all your other content more desirable and reputable by association. I think more Internet publications may engage in &quot;loss leader&quot; prestige content over time.",1426388556

I have met people who were justifying censorship, population control and unfair business practices because they could benefit from them someday. I was expecting a little more regard to civil liberties and ethics from students and so called &quot;hackers&quot;.<p>People win by making &quot;cool&quot; apps (Uber for X) whereas technical hacks are totally ignored.<p>I am glad that people are motivated to succeed but this lead to some of them taking themselves very seriously. Often to the expense of ethics.<p>&quot;There is such ignorance in this world about who we are. We are not criminals. We are innovators. We create things. We change the world.[...]&quot;<p>And this is one example among many other from a guy who has never engineered anything. Weeks are spent planning for their new &quot;great project&quot; with at the end little to no execution.<p>Students who believe to be 1000x SE because they can stick two APIs together and use bootstrap end-up to be very condescending older engineers.<p>This &quot;bro&quot;/&quot;my framework is the best&quot;/&quot;Make money fast&quot; culture that stinks a little bit IMO.<p>Hackathons are great to try out new technologies, meet new people and outreach to demographics that are traditionally under-represented in CS but I don&#x27;t like where this is headed.<p>Like HS there is &quot;cool kids&quot; who are &quot;Student Entrepreneur&quot; or &quot;Innovator, UX Artist blah blah&quot;, &quot;RoR Genius&quot; etc... and the rest of the world.<p>My apologies if this post is a little bit ranty, I hope to get other perspectives on this.",1426388524

That&#x27;s the question you would have to answer to understand it.<p>Right now I&#x27;m reading Gibbon&#x27;s Decline and Fall, and constantly stop to write down scenario ideas based on what he&#x27;s describing. Of course, I also look up a lot of modern historical research on the matter — so I use recently acquired knowledge to understand related stuff and read about the same things from different sources. I also read comic books, having just finished the original Ghost in the Shell about 2 minutes before starting to write this comment; during the last week, I&#x27;ve set up animated-interactive-comic engine protorype in Unity3d and have been experimenting with primitive compositions that would work well both as game cameras and frozen comic panels.<p>If you want to read and remember something in the first place, you must have motivation.

Some people do things like pick phrases from Hamlet and stuff some numbers on the end, so truncating them would seriously compromise their expected strength.<p>Or XKCD style passphrases.  Using the Oxford 3000 dictionary gets you about 1 bit of entropy per character.

Hence reading must be efficient.<p>But there is a soft spot between a code being too long or too concise, either abuse making it harder to scan. And we scan a lot.<p>Take the colon in Python blocks for example, it is syntaxically useless:<p><pre><code>     if stuff: # <- the compiler could do without this\n         foo()\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s main appeal is to improve your hability to scan the code:<p>- your brain can quickly catch all starting block in all nested these indents.\n- it&#x27;s way easier to type than &quot;{&quot;\n- you use it the same way you would do it while writting english (see this very post).

The cold reality is that most open source projects aren&#x27;t really TRYING to attract contributors.  Small-time hobbyists often don&#x27;t want to play with others in their personal project sandboxes, and big-time projects with high profile usually put up high barriers to contribution.<p>Unable to attract as many end-users, or as much public mindshare?  Now this makes more sense.  Many of the high-profile moves to GitHub are really about P.R., and signaling friendless to the developer community (e.g. Microsoft&#x27;s recent image re-branding efforts).  Not having a GitHub presence DOES make you less visible and more isolated from developers today.<p>Either way, I would argue that GitHub is really just a sort of Facebook or Twitter-like presence for software organizations.  A way to draw attention, publicity, or mindshare from the public... but often merely a hosting mirror, and not even the primary toolset through which the software is actually developed.<p>This being the case, who cares if GitHub is dominant?  Or SourceForge ten years ago, or whatever the next popular thing might be ten years from now?

And a blind webpage, one without hyperlinks, can’t look or gaze at another webpage – and this has serious consequences for the dynamics of power on the web.<p>More or less all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object, devoid of intelligence or agency. But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently: it is more empowering. When a powerful website – say Google or Facebook – gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it , it brings it into existence; gives it life. Without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind, and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.<p>Apps like Instagram are blind, or almost blind.

The SNG trucks are nice to have when something big does break, but most of the time they are simply not needed ... hence the contrived uses and excuses.<p>I think the sharp decline in costs for competing technologies are forcing a rethink of newsgathering costs.

It explains why the infrastructure in suburbs is not financially sustainable without reference to speculations of higher energy prices (like a Kunstler would) and how political leadership often goes awry in how it pursues development.<p>The tl;dr which I&#x27;ll do in three paragraphs is that suburbs tend to overestimate how much tax revenue they&#x27;re going to get from the development pattern that involves a lot of corporate brand name stores popping up off of main roads. The taxes don&#x27;t pay for the roads so the towns have to lean on the Federal government for funding.<p>The suggestion is that towns and businesses need to redevelop downtown areas which have more efficient infrastructure costs because they will no longer be able to externalize those infrastructure costs onto large state governments or the federal government.<p>Also, across the board, politicians and developers tend to emphasize the benefits of new developments while minimizing the presentations of the costs of maintenance. The book also kills some new-urbanist sacred cows like bike lanes because they are usually both insane from a financial perspective and extremely dangerous for both cyclists and drivers.<p>So the thrust of it is that if you thought the cities were bad, the suburbs are often worse. It will also make you rethink a lot of the media hoopla over urban development in countries like China which make supersized versions of these kinds of errors. A $100 million infrastructure project sounds awesome until you realize that it will cost $500 million without generating that much in taxes to prevent it from collapsing into a blighted ruin in less than a decade.",1451679921

While that may not sound that bad, there are a few things that add teeth:<p>1.  Cops make OK money compared to an average citizen, but not GREAT money.  Their retirement is often tied to employment with a particular city, county, etc.  Too many disciplinary actions, or one really big one, will result in being fired, meaning you&#x27;ve also lost your retirement investment.<p>2.  If you want a better/higher-paying job within the department (detective, SWAT, aviation, etc.), you have to get internally hired for it.  If your record is tainted by documented misconduct, you&#x27;re probably never going to get promoted.<p>3.  The law enforcement community is small and paperwork follows you everywhere.

I remember when (we) engineers got REAL WORK DONE on x86 PC&#x27;s with 10 MB HDD&#x27;s, running AutoCAD, Lotus 123, and Word Perfect. This was inarguably the beginning of the era of the useful, general-purpose computer. You could load a computer DOS 6.22, Windows 3.11, several of these programs, and still have room leftover for Doom. The author references Apple&#x27;s iPad page at 51 MB. The last time I rebuilt my gaming PC, the MOUSE DRIVER was 150 MB! It makes me weep for where we are.

They&#x27;re appointed by, say, a mayor, or a governor - if they do a &quot;good&quot; job of prosecuting brutality, are they going to get a further appointment to a judgeship, or get enough support from the police union to pursue an elected office?  How are they going to get good staff when they can&#x27;t promise them any advancement inside that office, and doing too good of a job precludes them from being employed in a proper prosecutor&#x27;s office?<p>Effectively all you&#x27;ve done is established an organization <i>specifically</i> dedicated to sweeping up messes.",1451678643

Which is why I have to take issue with the following premise of the entire article:<p><i>&quot;central bankers around the world simultaneously increased their inflation targets from 2% to 4% and fully re-loaded their quantitative easing programs. To their embarrassment, consumer prices only continued to decline&quot;</i><p>To quote an economist that I heard: <i>In the history of civilization, there has never been a case of a central bank operating using fiat currency that has tried to create inflation and failed.</i><p>If the government of any country wanted to create inflation, it&#x27;s extremely simple to do so. Just print $10,000 for every citizen in the country and hand it out to them as a christmas gift. If $10,000 isn&#x27;t enough to do the trick, try a hundred grand. Or a million. At some point, the economy will be swimming in so much cheap money, and a roughly fixed amount of real goods, that the price of each good is bound to increase. Weimar Germany is a classic example of this. The entire premise of this &quot;fiction&quot; is so flawed, that it can only be described as fantasy.",1451678581

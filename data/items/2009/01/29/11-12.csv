Maybe you say, ""Well, I'm not sure how that's going to evolve, but it'll probably evolve in an interesting way with this team,"" then I'm happy to invest and see how it goes, because, historically what's happened is they've figured out that there was some other twist, or there was a better market, or there was a better way to get to a group of people.<p>And so I would always start with the people, first.</i>",1233230135

It's good to have an awesome idea, but if you have a great team then the ideas will come, and even if this one won't work, the next one probably will.<p>VCs need to work with the team, need to have faith in the team, and need to have a sense that the ideas will come. The current idea is a good start, and an indication, but in the grander scheme of things, it's the team that reall counts.  They're the ones that will make things work.<p>A good team with an awesome idea is not investable.<p>An awesome team with a good idea, is.",1233229006

There is a cost to the ""employers"" to have an intern, even if you pay them nothing.  They take time from existing employees, and use resources.<p>This is not to say that interns are a bad idea.  They're not.  They're an excellent idea, but internships are a part of education.  They are one of the most valuable, useful and effective parts of education.<p>Paying for them is not stupid.

456196,comment,455845,455900,0,0,kragen,,,"Maybe it would be better if the machine's owner could extract that secure channel, rather than the OS.  For example, if you could reflash the BIOS with a JTAG header on the motherboard, then you could be sure that no compromised BIOS code survived (unless your JTAG programmer was broken).  Or you could have a boot monitor in non-Flash ROM that could checksum the Flash BIOS, and then you could compare the checksum to the version before the malware ran, and pop the Flash chip out of its socket to replace it if necessary.<p>Does that answer the threat model you're thinking of?<p>A lot of the stuff under the ""Trusted Computing"" rubric goes a lot further than what you're describing.  Some of it is designed to allow third parties (other than the OS and the machine's owner) to establish a secure channel to the chipset and the hardware over the network.

456192,comment,455637,455637,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I can't be too specific about the circumstances ...<p>A colleague of mine was teaching a class, and after a few weeks set a test.  He also took a note of who sat where, and noted that three friends, A, B and C, were sitting together in the back.  When he graded the test he found that on question 3, A and B had identical incorrect answers, whereas on question 7, B and C had identical incorrect answers.  He joked that this showed that A and C were conspiring to make it appear that B was cheating, but the evidence was clear - cheating had occured.  He decided it was an interesting lesson for him, and it was OK since that test only counted for 5% of the final grade.<p>For the next test he created two, nearly identical tests, differing only in the actual numbers.  All the calculations were identical, just the numbers were different.  He gave these out alternately.<p>As office hours approached on the day after the graded tests were returned, there was a <i>very</i> long queue.  He invited the first student in, who immediately started complaining that on question 6, he and his friend had identical answers, but his friend got full marks and he got zero. ""But the questions are different,"" said my colleague.  ""But the answers are the same - why don't we get the same grade?"" complained the student.  After running around that little loop for a while the light dawned, the student became very thoughtful, and left.  ""Next!"" said my colleague.  No one came in, and when he checked, the queue was gone.<p>The students complained to the Dean, and my colleague was told in no uncertain terms that it was unacceptable to give different tests.  In particular, it was unfair not to have warned them, or made it obvious. The students had no way of knowing that they were equivalent, it was impossible to prove that they were equivalent, so he was instructed to give identical tests to everyone.<p>On the next test he handed out alternate blue and yellow test sheets.  There was muttering, but no outright complaints.  Within an hour, however, he was summoned to the Dean's office.  ""You were told to give identical tests!"" shouted the Dean.  ""I did"", said my colleague.  ""They were on different colored paper, but they were identical tests.""<p>The reaction from the Dean was, says my colleague, remarkably similar to that of the student discovering that the tests were different.<p>Fortunately that was the last ""in class"" test.  The final loomed, and one by one the students dropped the course.  The final test was only taken by 12 of the initial 40 students, and all passed.  Interestingly, of those that dropped out, several were later disciplined for cheating in other classes.<p>So the evidence suggests that cheating occurs.<p>But we knew that.",1233227212

""In biblical terms, there is nothing new under the sun"":<p>""You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.""<p>--  Commencement address by Steve Jobs<p>""The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty damn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress, we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty — some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don’t know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question — to doubt — to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained.""<p>-- ""The Value of Science,"" address to the National Academy of Sciences (Autumn 1955) in What Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character, Richard Feynman.",1233226897

It sounds to me like those projects should never have been using hadoop in the first place.  If your problem is not IO constrained naturally, moving it to hadoop will make it IO constrained.  In my experience doing that will get you a 10x-100x slowdown versus a more appropriate solution on the same hardware.<p>If your problem is IO constrained, for example processing 10 TB of log data, hadoop will get all your disks to 100% utilization just as well as anything else will.  It will leave your processors horribly underutilized, but that's just the nature of IO constrained problems.

I can not completely back this up, but it is well known in body building:-<p>Person begins to diet, they actually do lose weight (rather than just the usual water weight), but up to 25% of the weight they lose is actually lean mass, that is muscle. Your body devours itself when it is lacking caloric input, via fat reserves, and muscle tissue. In order to minimise the muscle loss and maximise fat loss, you need to be doing an appropriate amount of strength training, as well as eating enough protein.<p>The worst possible outcome is that you do a number of cycles of a diet, with zero strength training, and every time you gain weight after a diet, you've gained more fat, and are now the proud owner of a body with even less lean mass.<p>Muscle burns energy even when idle, fat does not.

One could argue that talk is cheap but I'm sure this guidance can lead to very valuable results maybe rethinking the idea or whatever the case.<p>2) You don't need domain experts in the beginning per se, just a bunch of minds who can quickly determine if they would use or not use a service. The motivation behind domain experts joining in the future might be just to help and give back to the entrepreneurial community (I admit this last point is kinda corny lol)",1321164726

3230142,comment,3229929,3230055,19,0,barrkel,,,"Germany has had a positive balance of trade (a trade surplus, i.e. it exported a lot more than it imported). If Germany had had its own currency (e.g. DM), importing nations would have had to buy DM in order to exchange them for German goods. The demand for DM would have pushed up the price of DM; this would have made importing goods from Germany more expensive.<p>But with the Euro, other countries in the Eurozone which have had a negative balance of trade (a trade deficit) balanced out Germany, preventing the Euro from appreciating too much. This helped Germany's export sector, helping keep them competitive.<p>The other issue with the Euro is that Germany's economy was already adjusted for low interest rates; but the introduction of the Euro meant low interest rates in countries which had not historically had them.<p>Ireland didn't have a big government deficit problem; Ireland's problem was a property bubble driven by reduced rates on mortgages. It only turned into governmental debt when the government guaranteed bank debt, having been convinced by the banking-political cabal in the middle of the 2008 crisis that the bank problem was liquidity, not solvency; but with banks holding assets formed from inflated house prices, they didn't have as much capital as they thought.",1321164584

If you hold yourself to a high standard of morality, even better. But don't judge someone completely based off this book, its hard to know what someone felt or thought unless you walked in there shoes.<p>Also, never buying another Apple product is a little short sighted. Jobs, while a great visionary, is hardly everything Apple. There are many many talented, hard working, brilliantly creative people that helped Apple become what it is today. I think it is human nature to want to point to a leader, a genius, ""the man"". The reality is that these products were created from the collective genius of many, not one person.<p>Anyways, my two cents.",1321164011

The trope is that Sam had a daily report ( presumably on green fanfold paper ) on his desk every day. Very much a tech leader in the pre-Internet network sense.<p>I lived in a town that had no Wal-Mart and then it did. Before, you had to drive to downtown or a retail area across town and the stores closed basically at dark.<p>If you went to Penney&#x27;s, it had hardwood floors, the clerk sent your transaction up a pneumatic tube to the cashier and got your change out of the same pneumatic tube. Banks still use these at drive in lanes.<p>Only the precursor to Wal-Mart - Gibsons - was open past 6:00ish ( I don&#x27;t remember the exact figure ). You had to conform to the store&#x27;s schedule. Mom would send orders with Dad to fill on lunch, back before we had two cars ( this was late &#x27;60s, early &#x27;70s ).<p>People invoke competition, but competition really only works out when the new guy has twice to ten times the impact that the incumbent has.

Gentrification has benefits and drawbacks, like everything else.<p>First, and foremost, the neighborhoods aren&#x27;t always run down. The Missions and the Williamsburgs of the world aren&#x27;t the only places undergoing gentrification. Sometimes they&#x27;re just neighborhoods largely populated by immigrants (Greenpoint in Brooklyn), or traditional working-class neighborhoods (Potrero Hill in SF). Being populated by immigrants or working-class folks doesn&#x27;t make a neighborhood run-down.<p>Second, what does it mean to &quot;fix up&quot; a neighborhood? I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s really just replacing the historic culture with the culture of the new residents (which is usually rich, mostly white people). Sure, one nice effect is a huge reduction in crime, but you&#x27;re also often replacing historic establishments with rich people tropes (e.g. Murry&#x27;s -> Whole Foods). Harlem will probably be a really safe place to be in 20 years, but isn&#x27;t it going to be a little bit of a shame when the Apollo gets replaced with a coffee shop?",1407004048

Similarly, fearful political rhetoric garners votes from a fearful populace, which makes them more fearful.

For commercial entities, there&#x27;s a whole class of product (&quot;data loss prevention&quot; systems) that do this out of the box.<p>Since (a) the information the USG is watching for is generated from within their network borders, and (b) USG isn&#x27;t comfortable sharing that information or artifacts of that information with third parties, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense for them to invest a huge amount of effort (both technically and legally) to come up with some cockamamie scheme to have Google look for those secrets without knowing what the secret is.<p>Instead of engaging with the intractable problem of having Google dragnet GMail for documents Google is not allowed to read, the USG is much more likely to just subpoena the accounts of people it suspects to be trafficking in those documents.",1407003511

This is a hash-based search against a corpus of known images, where the hash function was designed explicitly (a) to survive image transformations and (b) to prevent unauthorized parties from predicting the hash of a given image.<p>Either of those two goals could fail and it would still be implausible that an attacker could trigger a false positive without using an image derived from actual known child pornography.",1407002676

(Luckily it was make believe so he was able to &quot;delete&quot; them before the other judges arrived with the tipoff but that&#x27;s not the point)<p>I think we shall soon enter a legal landscape where mere possession of digital products does not imply legal possession.

Thats the problem with hipsters - they buy the property out from under some residents, then make it impossible for those that remain to afford anything. They are like locusts. Eventually (as we see in London) they even price <i>themselves</i> out of an area, then move onto the next to destroy. E.g. from Stoke Newington to Dalston. What about the people there already, who can&#x27;t afford to shop at Wholefood Market?",1407002573

If ffmpeg <i>can</i> be written in Rust without any disadvantages compared to C, then that&#x27;s an easier way to ensure memory safety than fuzzing.

I may be wrong about the two finger gesture being disabled by default (edited my post to reflect that) -- it was my impression that it wasn&#x27;t, but regardless I think we can agree it is not the most salient feature to new users. Using two fingers on the trackpad also means I cannot just reach out with my thumb to click but actually need to move my hand to perform the gesture.<p>My comment may have given the wrong impression -- I am not arguing that forcing links in new windows is a good thing, simply that it is not the anti-pattern people make it to be. In some cases like an app where accidentally leaving the page may lead to data loss or to a form resubmission, I actually think it&#x27;s an acceptable trade-off and not an awful choice at all. I do agree with the author that in The Verge&#x27;s case it isn&#x27;t.<p>My comment was just based on the (totally subjective, of course) observation that to me that I tend to use a &quot;open/close tabs&quot; flow these days much more than &quot;forward/backward in history&quot;, and that the &quot;back&quot; functionality seems less important than it used to be a few years ago because of changes in the way websites are designed.<p>Issues of choice aside (which seem to be your main grief; I have nothing to argue against it), the usability studies that condemn the practice tend use the fact that it disrupts the &quot;back&quot; functionality as one of their main arguments.

If every black person sees you and thinks &quot;honkey,&quot; you will likely experience hurt feelings, and a slight discomfort when in certain neighborhoods.

A portfolio of 100% VTI is indeed diverse, tax-efficient, and has low expenses. Personally, I&#x27;d add some amount of VXUS (international stocks) for further diversification and MUB (tax-free municipal bonds) for safety. You could do very well with just these three ETFs, often known as a &quot;lazy&quot; portfolio:<p><a href""http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfoli"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio</a><p>Keep in mind, though, that there are no guarantees. Stocks will have bad years, and you should expect that some years they will lose 50% of their value. The key is to choose an allocation that you can live with so you don&#x27;t panic and sell when things get bad. Keep contributing and rebalance regularly (once or twice a year is usually enough). Tune out all the noise and stick to your plan. Even with these dips, most people expect stocks to perform better than any other asset class in the long term (20+ years).<p>I&#x27;d also recommend The Little Book of Common Sense Investing:<p><a href""http://www.amazon.com/dp/047010210"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470102101</a><p>It&#x27;s written by John Bogle, who founded Vanguard to bring diversified, low-cost investing to the masses.

DDG doesn&#x27;t offer this option.<p>⚫ Some specialized search, in particular Google Books and Google Scholar.  Where Google focuses on its core competency of providing <i>search</i> and not on grabbing as much user data as possible, I find the company far more acceptable.<p>⚫ Some deep-site searches.  Google seems to crawl sites more deeply and in more detail than DDG.  I particularly rely on it for Reddit, whose own site search excludes comments.<p>As I&#x27;ve noted, Google&#x27;s biggest liability is that, no matter its best intentions, it cannot provide any guarantee against a government-size advanced persistent threat, especially not one with the law (constitutional or otherwise) at its disposal:  <a href""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1u356d/schmidt_my_biggest_mistake_is_still_not_realizing"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1u356d/schmidt_...</a><p>But overall, I&#x27;m hugely impressed with DDG.<p>For those who use console / terminal browsers such as w3m or links, the &#x27;lite&#x27; version puts the &quot;search&quot; button one tab following the search dialog:  <a href""https://duckduckgo.com/lit"" rel""nofollo"">https://duckduckgo.com/lite</a><p>And DDG&#x27;s TTY mode (command-line interface) is teh awesomenessedness:<p><a href""https://duckduckgo.com/tty"" rel""nofollo"">https://duckduckgo.com/tty/</a>",1389399900

Sean Ellis, who is happy to tell you he coined the phrase, considers most marketing for the sake of driving growth &quot;growth hacking.&quot; But, despite the fact that what I do probably matches both of those definitions, I would still <i>never</i> call myself a growth hacker.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t call myself that is because calling yourself a &quot;growth hacker&quot; is akin to calling yourself a &quot;social media guru&quot; or a &quot;rockstar programmer.&quot; It&#x27;s a buzz-word that&#x27;s been taken over by people who have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about.

Interestingly enough I find a few brilliant minds when I&#x27;m roaming amongst the blackhatters of the world. The seedy underbelly of the Internet has some really sharp people in it determined to continually out-engineer Google, beat other systems, or just brute force something. And sometimes what they do is pretty ingenious. You can actually learn a lot from them if you look at the principles they use, legitimize them, and use them for good instead of evil. There are a lot of script kiddies to be sure, but that caliber of brilliant marketer, whether it be a spammer who uses it for evil or some of the marketers causing explosive growth at young companies rarely beat their chests and assign themselves buzz-wordy titles. They don&#x27;t have to.<p>Just like social media experts don&#x27;t call themselves &quot;gurus.&quot; No one of any high level of legitimacy has ever assigned themselves the term &quot;Thought leader.&quot; In the same way, 99% of the people who call themselves &quot;growth hackers&quot; are at a marketing intern equivalent level.<p>It&#x27;s just turned into another phrase people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing throw around because it sounds cool.",1389399869

On pages that load content dynamically, results are not always predictable either<p>- my left hand is already positioned in such a way that hitting cmd/ctrl + w is trivial, whereas going back requires reaching all the way to the backspace button/the mouse/doing a multi-finger gesture on the trackpad<p>- if you had to submit content to get to the current page, usually going back will trigger a &quot;confirm form resubmission&quot; warning<p>- on mobile devices, the &quot;back&quot; functionality is not very prominently displayed. On Chrome, you have to click the &quot;more&quot; icon to access it<p>In addition, manually opening in a new tab (which requires right-clicking, middle-clicking, or ctrl/cmd + click) is not always as trivial as people imply:<p>- people who are using a trackpad do not have a middle button<p>- right-clicking is has not been part of Apple&#x27;s design for a long time. You can perform them using cmd + click or using two fingers on the trackpad (I believe it is disabled by default), but it&#x27;s not as convenient<p>- On a MacBook, the modifier keys (fn/control/option/command) are all placed next to each other and it&#x27;s not always obvious which one does what.

I&#x27;ve personally done option + click by mistake countless times, which opens a prompt to save the link, and it&#x27;s always pretty frustrating<p>- the right-click equivalent on touch screens (long press) is a bit clunky<p>And this is coming from a tech-savvy user who actually knows about these options -- you&#x27;d be surprised at how many people don&#x27;t.

7040607,comment,7039043,7039785,4,0,Dewie,,,"The Scandinavian countries rank high, probably the highest, when it comes to gender equality. They also rank high when it comes to having a gender segregated labour market. You might find more women in STEM in a third world country that has less gender equality than in a Scandinavian country. One possible explanation is that these countries are affluent while countries with more gender inequality tend to be less affluent. If you don&#x27;t have a social safety net, and maybe even have to rely on finding a husband to provide for you and all the uncertainty that goes with that, if you don&#x27;t find a job for yourself that is lucrative enough, STEM might be a good choice. But if you live in a country with both a lot of gender equality <i>and</i> income equality? Then money doesn&#x27;t factor into it that much anymore...<p>I tried to Google for the articles I&#x27;ve read about this but I didn&#x27;t manage to find them.",1389398774

Such bullying incidents may look like PR victories for the PC crowd in terms of shaping public opinion. What they miss though is that even when they don&#x27;t backfire loudly (see &quot;donglegate&quot;), they turn off moderate people who are otherwise neutral or sympathetic to reasonable calls for equal opportunities. By trying to guilt trip the whole white/male segment of society as &quot;privileged&quot; and &quot;misogynistic&quot;, some will bite but many won&#x27;t, much more so when they feel they are unfairly put on the defensive. And while some will bend over backwards and become more Catholic than the Pope promoting their social justice causes, many will grow more and more resentful. They won&#x27;t tweet and blog about it but they will be taking notes and making sure they stay the hell away from PC zealots and their ilk, be it in hiring decisions, investment funding or anything else.

Reading it now, it hit me that government programs have to ask for budget increases, but colleges can just raise the price and be guaranteed the money because students can always get more loans.<p>So this was actually the intention behind transitioning colleges from free to paid.  It created the student loan bubble because there was no check on how much college could cost.  To fix it, we could just do the reverse and make state colleges free with their budgets set by the government, substantially lower than they are now.",1389398733

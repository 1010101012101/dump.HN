6352298,comment,6350640,6350640,4,0,comex,,,"> But our SGX-isolated VMs have one significant advantage over the other VM technologies we got used to in the last decade or so – namely those VMs can now be impenetrable to any other entity outside of the VM. No kernel or hypervisor can peek into its memory. Neither can the SMM, AMT, or even a determined physical attacker with DRAM emulator, because SGX automatically encrypts any data that leave the processor, so everything that is in the DRAM is encrypted and useless to the physical attacker.<p>So basically, when used for real security, it is a more modular substitute for a subset of the functionality of secure boot that has the dubious benefit of protecting against an attacker with a DRAM emulator - except it currently doesn&#x27;t even do that, because there is no way to secure user input.<p>When used for DRM, of course, it works just fine.  It&#x27;s basically the rebirth of the whole Trusted Computing brouhaha, but worse, because it doesn&#x27;t depend on securing the entire boot path and is thus actually practical to implement in some browser plugin.  While it will not be possible to depend on this feature being present in users&#x27; CPUs for the next few years, it could become very dangerous after that.<p>Ugh.",1378712964

6352291,comment,6351144,6351144,26,0,mattjaynes,,,"Just finished writing a book where I compare the experience of using Puppet, Chef, Salt, and Ansible. I use each tool to build an identical system so you can get a sense of how each one approaches the same problem.<p>The most valuable thing I got from that project was my introduction to Ansible. It was really a shining star in the pack.<p>I have to give credit to its predecessors (CFEngine/Puppet/Chef) and its competitor Salt all for being great tools in their own right. But it is Ansible that has the power and simplicity to really take on the ultimate competitor: manual installs and hodge-podge shell scripts.<p>Many of you would be shocked at how many tech companies still don&#x27;t use any kind of configuration management (CM) tool.<p>When you think about it, a company&#x27;s server setup is essentially the foundational &quot;app&quot; that the actual business app runs on. So, not using a CM tool is kinda like having no tests and no version control for your most important software.<p>Sound insane? It is.<p>Most developers would laugh at a company that had zero tests and didn&#x27;t version control or even backup their code. But that&#x27;s exactly what many companies do with their systems.<p>Yet, for many businesses, they don&#x27;t realize the astronomical risks and costs of this neglect.<p>At a recent client job, the former system administrator set up all their servers manually and left ZERO documentation. I had to spend a few weeks devining what he did and try to capture everything into a CM tool (Chef in this case). Not one week after I finished doing that, one of their key servers inexplicably failed. Fortunately, I had done the work needed and they were able to bring up a replacement within minutes. Had that work not been done, the company would have been severly crippled and might have even died due to the days of downtime that would have been inevitable.<p>That&#x27;s just a tiny example. The cost savings for a business are huge when the team uses a CM tool. When it takes a couple minutes to bring up a new server instead of hours/days/weeks, that&#x27;s a huge savings (assuming your engineers cost greater than $0).<p>With Ansible, there is no more an excuse for not using a CM tool. It&#x27;s so simple that it can actually be <i>easier</i> than doing a manual install or writing a shell script. Some of the more complex CM tools take difficult weeks to learn, but with Ansible you can be up and running with confidence in a couple hours.<p>Not only that, but Ansible gives you robust remote execution capabilities right out of the box along with a lot of other cool stuff.<p>Shameless plug:<p>If you want to see Ansible in action and how it compares to the other CM tools, check out my book.

Why is Windows 8.X the first version of Windows not to have visual clues to the user in some form? Of course the desktop part has them, minimize, maximize, close buttons on Windows. But Metro UI does not.<p>If I were Tim Cook I would not worry about Microsoft taking away anything Apple has done. I would just develop a less expensive version of the iPhone and iPad series, perhaps the iPhone Lite or iPad Lite that can compete with Surface phones and tablets in price.

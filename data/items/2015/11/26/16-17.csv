In contrast, some evidence suggests that soy foods, by inhibiting absorption, may increase the dose of thyroid hormone required by hypothyroid patients. However, hypothyroid adults need not avoid soy foods. In addition, there remains a theoretical concern based on in vitro and animal data that in individuals with compromised thyroid function and/or whose iodine intake is marginal soy foods may increase risk of developing clinical hypothyroidism. Therefore, it is important for soy food consumers to make sure their intake of iodine is adequate.&quot;",1448556924

This language allows me to write things into existence, entire complex structures. In fact, within the bounds of the virtual (mostly), I can create pretty much anything I want!<p>As a child I created a game that my father actually got addicted to. I didn&#x27;t need paper, pencils, scissors, or any other things that I&#x27;m not too good with. Just a computer and a knowledge of it&#x27;s language (Object Pascal).<p>As a teenager, I created realistic environments that many people spent hours immersed in, sneaking, attacking, finding secrets, and whatnot.

It still feels like magic after all these years.<p>While sometimes I wish my work felt more &#x27;real&#x27;, like the tables a friend of mine &#x27;hand-crafts&#x27;, I still sometimes stop and marvel at what I can do with just a text editor and a laptop.

They didn&#x27;t arrive there by just wanting an open-source browser. Yes, there was a network effect at play too (everyone &quot;optimized&quot; for MSIE), but they were able to bootstrap their user base with the tech-savvy who were fed up with the horrible HTML/CSS/JS support browsers of the time offered.<p>They did not have that vision with FirefoxOS - they wanted to secure a foothold in the mobile market, but had no compelling idea on how to gain that in the face of Apple/Google.

This is China, they have a pretty liberal (and one could argue: more reasonable) approach to issues of intellectual property :).<p>Or at least it used to be so; sadly, in the last few years the US was pressuring Chinese government to crack down on it. Anyway, you can read more about this phenomenon here: [0].<p>Oh, and one more thing. It may not apply to RPi in terms of cloning it because it&#x27;s still quite a niche product, but in general, <i>they actually recycle electronics here</i>. Like, seriously, when you throw away your smartphone, it&#x27;ll likely end up in China for desoldering. So will your laptop. The amount of desoldered components and especially ICs available for sale is staggering. I have no data for this, but I&#x27;m pretty sure people here are making small-scale production runs out of recycled ICs. So Broadcom may not sell you their chip, but the lady on the first floor of SEG building in Shenzhen just might.<p>BTW., I love how they recycle components so much, and how it leads to interesting situations sometimes. For instance, I recently got my phone fixed - $15 and 15 minutes of waiting was all it took to get the front half of Galaxy S4 replaced with a brand new part (screen + touch surface + glass + box) and to get a new camera (electronics, lens and all). The equivalent repair at home would cost me around $240 and would take a few days. The secret of such cheap and fast repair? <i>They took the broken parts from me</i>. They&#x27;ll regain 90% of value of that repair by simply replacing broken subcomponents in their own time, and then pushing the fixed modules back onto the market.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?cat=20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?cat=20</a>",1448555314

The ESP8266 can want to use more current than the Arduino is rated to supply.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at a few &quot;Instructables&quot; articles on ESP8266 and Arduino, and a large fraction of them seem to have this issue.<p>Another issue many of them that use a 5V Arduino have is that they ignore the difference between the logic levels of the 5V Arduino and the 3.3V ESP8266. For the connection from the ESP8266 UART Tx to the Arduino Rx, that&#x27;s probably fine. The ESP8266 will drive the line to 3.3v, and that is high enough for the Arduino to recognize it as high on the Rx line, as long as you are powering the Arduino through the USB port or through the barrel jack (I&#x27;m using Arduino Uno for my examples, so some adjustment may be needed for other models).<p>If you are powering through the 5V pin, which bypasses the 5V regulator on the Arduino, then you could have a problem if your voltage is high. The minimum voltage seen as a logic 1 on the input pins goes up as supply voltage goes up, and since you are already near the edge when hooking an 3.3V ESP8266 up directly, you have to be careful.<p>For the connection the other way, Arduino UART Tx to ESP8266 UART Rx, you are putting a 5V signal on a pin that&#x27;s supposed to only take up to 3.3V. The ESP8266 has built-in protection against over-voltage which probably will save you, but this is not good practice.<p>Simplest fix here is to use a 1k and 2k resistor to make a voltage divider for the Arduino Tx -> ESP8266 Rx signal. Note that this only works for going from the higher voltage side to the lower voltage side. That&#x27;s fine here, since on the Tx->Rx connection only the Tx side drives the line.<p>If you have to hook different voltage I/O pins together and both sides can drive, you need something more elaborate. There&#x27;s a cool solution that uses two resistors and a MOSFET. That, and some others, is given here [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/97889/is-there-any-bidirectional-5v-3-3v-level-shifter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/97889/is-ther...</a>",1448554310

When she got to the top of the steps, she saw her family’s living room ‘‘covered in cops.’’ There were at least five officers in riot gear, guns drawn. They had bulletproof vests and pads and helmets with visors.<p>This line doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>If officers showed up in SWAT/riot gear, they wouldn&#x27;t let <i>anyone</i> leave their presence unsupervised, especially if someone else was in the house. SWAT only goes in for situations where they believe violence is imminent. Therefore they go room to room to clear/gather everyone, make sure potential victims are secured, and that no one is armed.<p>If her/NYT&#x27;s description is accurate, they broke procedure and put themselves and any possible victims at extreme risk.<p>Are there any third party or police reports of this event?",1448553860

This explains some of the frustration many students suffer, which makes them claim CS is detached from the real needs of programmers. This also explains articles like &quot;the perils of Java schools&quot; -- a &quot;Java school&quot; is by definition NOT teaching CS! CS is a theoretical field which has applications for the software industry (otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be very interesting), but it is &quot;researchy&quot; and theoretical <i>first</i>. It is the foundation of computing, kind of like applied maths, and not supposed to be training for your next job. Unless, of course, your next job actually requires a scientist or someone with a good understanding of the theory.<p>This unfortunate conflation of &quot;CS&quot; and &quot;programming&quot; is so common it&#x27;s starting to become the mainstream definition of CS, much to my annoyance, and soon it will no longer make sense to push back against it :(",1448553761

JavaScript is not perfect,\nbut almost all what is presented on sites similar to wtfjs.com are non-issues to me. It may be stupid\nor surprising that API behaves in some ways, but as long as it behaves exactly as in documentation it is not much of a problem. I always check available documentation even for basic APIs in every language that I use. i.e. I was amazed that even senior developers at my previous job did not know that strncpy is practically useless. It was just `man strncpy` away.<p>In a way static typing can save you just like reading of documentation, but in a more organized manner. That said you should still eat your ve^W^W^W read documentation.<p>What helps in case of dynamic languages is REPL. It is even better than documentation sometimes. You can easly check every line with your reasoning. For C or C++ I always have some simple file for testing basic constructs to check my assumptions. One could argue that that is the role of unit tests, but one does not prevent the other. Unit tests are same thing, but in more organized manner.",1448553639

It's a pretty good way to easily identify bottlenecks.

(This might be why schizotypal subjects score higher on tests of creativity. They are less able to ignore those distracting thoughts, which largely arise from the right hemisphere.)""<p>This is a testable hypothesis: Give low doses of amphetamines to schizophrenics and see if they get better or worse. This has been done, and they clearly get worse. In fact, you can induce schizophrenic symptoms (that is, psychosis) in normal healthy adults by giving them sufficient amounts of amphetamines. Furthermore, the effect of amphetamines is known to be reduced, if not eliminated, by simultaneously administering dopamine antagonists, which are typically used for the treatment of schizophrenia. All of this adds up to amphetamines being promoters of creativity (whatever it means, so long as it's something associated with schizophrenia) rather than inhibitors.",1279410155

Even if you managed that, any decent front-end developer would probably rewrite it themselves to get the best interaction, ""bulletproof-ness"", and optimization possible. What would be far more useful is a design tool that incorporates HTML + CSS by using them for the layout of the image, but doesn't attempt to write them decently. Doing so would make it easy to use CSS to quickly change something like the font, while not trying to write decent front-end code.<p>In addition, I'd love it if this tool had the following. Even if it only had one of these things, I'd probably buy it.<p>1. Way to easily deal with text. In photoshop, text is a pain to deal with, especially for things like navigation. If there was a way to easily style the text of a file with css in addition to a gui method, things would be much more pleasurable and efficient.<p>2. Decent ways to include header, sidebar, and footer elements. Currently, a designer has to duplicate these across multiple files which makes updating even a snippet of text an arduous process involving opening many files.<p>3. A common browser element palette.

If you are going to try to sell something to designers and use words like aesthetics in your sales copy, you will most likely fail if your own presentation is not aesthetically pleasing.

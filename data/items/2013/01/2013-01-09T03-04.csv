5030053,comment,5029720,5029720,14,0,CleanedStar,,,"When Karl Marx wrote Capital in 1867, he said capitalism would never be able to get rid of credit bubbles, financial crises, high unemployment etc.  He said that over time the problems would get worse and worse with greater and greater financial crises.  Here we are about a century and a half later and you just have to look at the housing bubble, the bank crisis, TARP and the government bailout, unemployment in the US and Europe and the Arab countries which helped cause the Arab spring to see how prophetic he was in this respect.<p>Marx and Engels wrote that the world has seen five economic systems.  Each system collapsed due to internal contradictions.  The first system was hunting-gathering, then Babylonian/Greek/etc. style slavery, then feudalism, and then capitalism.  They saw the Paris Commune as the harbinger for the next economic system which would replace capitalism.<p>The central contradiction in capitalism Marx spells out clearly in Capital, although its a little too much to explain in a comment.  Basically workers create $240 of wealth every eight hour work day, but are only paid $200 a day.  The $40 goes to profit, to get more capital, to make more commodities.  But what is happening here - the worker is shorted $40 a day, and what happens with that money is commodities are made.  Who are going to buy all these commodities when workers are not getting all the wealth they create?  Well credit fixes that in the short term but creates a bigger long term problem.<p>The communist manifesto says ""the commercial crises that by their periodic return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on trial, each time more threateningly"".  I certainly feel this way.  So apparently does Stratfor.  On this point, the left and right are in agreement.",1357703957

The big banks here in my country are so inefficient and I'm hoping to simply make a better banking experience for consumers, hopefully via their mobile phones. Can somebody shed some light on a few questions I have?<p>#1: I have absolutely no business background. Do I need to get an MBA in order to understand how banks work from the back-office, and maybe the legalities? Reading this article, the Simple co-founder apparently had an MBA. I'm a programmer by trade (Java, Android/iOS, a little of web).<p>#2: Should I consider Simple a competitor or should I think of banking as a very local kind of industry, like e-commerce? I don't want to build just another Simple clone, and considering Simple's success, if they scale up here in southeast Asia, I don't want to be just a copycat.",1357703809

5030044,comment,5029825,5029825,11,0,the_bear,,,"I tried signing up for Simple, and the entire experience was pretty terrible. I realize that they're a new company trying to tackle a big problem so I wanted to cut them some slack, but the ways in which they messed up are hard to forgive.<p>Last July, I got my invitation to use Simple.com, which I'd been really excited about for over a year. I start signing up, and instantly I'm surprised by how their signup form is both the most visually attractive form I'd ever used on a website, and how it barely worked. I ran into three different bugs just with the initial signup form.<p>One of the bugs was that it asks what type of smartphone I have. When I selected Android, it said to submit the form, but that they don't have an Android app yet. No problem, I don't care about a mobile app. The problem is that when you selected Android, the form broke and there was no way to submit it. I'd already spent several minutes filling out the form (including giving them info on my other bank account to transfer money into Simple) and I didn't want to lose all my info, so I just said that I had an iPhone so I could continue signing up.<p>Then I get to the next screen where it says that the only way to continue the signup process is to install the iPhone app. Of course I couldn't do this, so I emailed their support explaining that I'd mistakenly said I have an iPhone because of a bug with their signup form. I get a response back saying that if I don't have an iPhone, there's no way to use Simple, so I'd have to be added to the Android waiting list.<p>One problem: they'd already taken the money out of my other bank account. I assumed that they hadn't done this because I'd never actually signed up or agreed to their terms or anything like that (you agree to the terms via their app). I actually only know that they transferred money out of my account because a different support person emailed me in November asking why in the world I wasn't using my Simple account. I responded saying that I'd already talked to them about this, and I didn't have an iPhone. That person told me that I didn't need an iPhone and that I could use the service by logging in online. I forwarded her the email from a different Simple support person contradicting what she said, and she just dismissed it (basically saying, ""yeah, that's not true"") without apologizing or offering an explanation.<p>So I tried resetting my password online so I could log in, only to run into yet another bug with their software. The password reset feature was completely broken. So I emailed the support person saying that their password reset feature didn't work. She ignored the issue (no apology, no explanation, nothing) and just told me that I don't need an iPhone without explaining how to actually get into the software, or why I was given incorrect information earlier.<p>That's where we are now. I've been run in circles by their customer service, I've encountered a half dozen different bugs, and that's without even being able to log in! My next step is to call their 800 number, but I'm already completely fed up with the experience and I won't be a customer of theirs regardless of the resolution at this point. I've been frustrated by every bank I've ever dealt with, but none of them have been as bad as Simple so far.<p>I seriously hope they get these kinks worked out so that other potential customers don't have the experience I've had.",1357703768

5030037,comment,5029825,5029962,3,0,lbotos,,,"I think a lot of people are missing the core of Simple. It's the ""Safe to Spend"" Idea. I've used simple for the past 8 months and it's helped me get into an even better mindset about saving/allotting money. I used to bank with PNC and use their budgeting tools but the safe to spend idea is just that; money you are free to use.<p>EDIT: For added perspective I'm an early twenties recent college grad.<p>Just the other day I realized that I had a credit card payment due and it was slightly higher than I expected (Holiday Spending) and I went into a minor panic as I was a little frazzled in paying it. I logged into simple and that's when I realized that I created a goal that was my credit card limit. This meant over the past month I had already slowly been paying down the bill without even realizing it. Everyday a small portion of my safe to spend was put into that goal. I made the payment without even ""rebudgeting"". That was a great feeling. I'm living well within my means but I feel like I have more money than ever. Simple makes it easy to keep yourself in check. I have a few items I plan on purchasing in the near future and I just created a few goals so that when the time comes I'll already have paid for it.<p>Lastly, the at a glance view of your finances without much ado is GREAT. I have an automatically generated daily average income/spending for the day/week/month/year averaged over various periods. I have graphs that show me how my funds have fluctuated and I'm starting to see some patterns in my spending habits. I've haven't banked like this before and I'm excited to see where else they can help.",1357703511

We currently show performance data in a typical dashboard, but I wish we had a newsfeed as well.  We're playing with some ideas, but it turns out to be a really hard problem.  I'd love to show a newsfeed with stories that say ""your site is 5% faster because you changed this one JavaScript file"" or ""your site is 20% slower than usual right now due to a spike in IE6 usage in China"".  Those stories are simple for anyone to understand, but really tough to generate without a ton of false-positives.  You have to account for daily, weekly or other seasonal changes in traffic patterns, even ones you wouldn't have an easy way to predict (like a commercial break during the Eastenders).  You have to know what's typical for each site so you can detect anomalies and also be smart enough not to set off alarms when you get 5 visitors from Liechtenstein instead of 1.  You have to wrestle with correlation vs. causation.

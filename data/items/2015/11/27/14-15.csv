The primary one that ships with Pharo is called, Monticello [0].<p>Images are also a huge advantage which the author has obviously not had time to exploit.<p>Knowing next to nothing about Smalltalk before the summer I checked out Pharo and wrote a small application to scrape the HN front page and display the links in a Painter window. I watched a few videos, read some tutorials, and eventually had a working Smalltalk program in a couple of days. It was actually a pleasant experience.<p>A typical workflow starts by writing a snippet of code in the playground that instantiates the program you want to run. You execute it and get dropped in the debugger. You slowly add the missing methods and tests, stepping through the debugger as you go, and eventually your program runs. If you ever need to take a break you can save your image -- debugging session and all -- and pick it up later. There&#x27;s no need to load up your source code and try to rebuild your application state to get to the point you were at when you last left your work.<p>That&#x27;s really powerful for interesting systems like the Moose platform [1].<p>Overall I think the author is too biased to his existing tools to appreciate what Smalltalk is really about.<p>[0] <a href=""http://pharo.gemtalksystems.com/book/PharoTools/Monticello/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pharo.gemtalksystems.com/book/PharoTools/Monticello/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://moosetechnology.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moosetechnology.org/</a>",1448636342

Read your comment again to understand it&#x27;s absurdity.<p>I don&#x27;t wish to sound belligerent, but You simply don&#x27;t understand money at all.<p>You&#x27;re suggesting increased government spending on infrastructure. But you somehow think the government can do that without borrowing money either from the Central Bank or the people. If this were possible, wouldn&#x27;t all governments be doing this already?<p>If the Central Bank asks the Treasury to print more money than the amount of assets it holds, (assets = Treasury bonds), it will either be (a) no longer capable of fulfilling it&#x27;s obligations or (b) effectively devaluating the currency and thereby increasing the inflation.<p>Also, Bank notes are not &quot;debt&quot;.

10637539,comment,10636818,10637006,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"> I think that the idea that humanity is always marching forward to better days is something implicit among people who live in peaceful affluent societies. But if you look at history, the world has always gone through cycles. No matter how much we improve socially, a regression seems almost inevitable. The Roman Empire did fall, and was followed by the Dark Ages.<p>The so-called Dark Ages were a period in which Roman-style governance was exported to the individual kingdoms of the former Roman Empire. Rome could only ever maintain political dominance for so long. Stability increased the might of kingdoms, these kingdoms didn&#x27;t always want to live under the thumb of Rome. Rome kept it up for a good long while, but it couldn&#x27;t do so forever.<p>The Middle Ages was when Europe became Europe. It saw the rise of a completely new type of institution, the pan-national Catholic Church, which became a third check against the power of kings. The manorial system grew out of the old Roman villa system and increased the output of farms and industry. This allowed militaries to professionalize and central government to flourish. Instead of one Rome and many vassal states, the vassal states each became their own Rome.<p>The intense competition between states eventually produced a theory of sovereignty that cut down on warfare tremendously.<p>The Middle Ages were not some dystopian hell out of which the Renaissance magically sprung up.",1448636268

10637528,comment,10629107,10629107,0,0,luxpir,,,"I might have to finally try it if so many people are claiming life-changing effects!<p>I don&#x27;t create or edit code for a living, for the most part, but I do use vim to edit workstation/server files and side-projects as well as a fair bit for notes and todo lists. I share the notes with an always-on raspberry pi via syncthing, which I can SSH into to check in a pinch.<p>There isn&#x27;t much incentive in this case to switch to emacs, then (although the idea of a wearable rpi with emacspeak instead of a HUD has always intrigued). My current todo list for keeping organised, after recently moving off of Trello, needed to be reasonably smart to replace it.<p>I think the solution is smart yet simple enough to work long term. It has been OK for a month or two now, at least, but I&#x27;m still open to improvements. It&#x27;s basically a vertical kanban board, instead of the usual horizontal one. I don&#x27;t need time tracking, as I don&#x27;t bill that way (but if it were automated, again, I&#x27;m open to it - could be interesting) but it would be nice to have alerts and reminders. For those I set reminders in tkremind for the important stuff - also copied and synced to the pi. The workflow is this:<p>- Tasks are entered into the relevant folding section, prepended with a timestamp [F5], with a #tag.<p>- As tasks complete, I  delete/paste [dd/p] into the invoicing section, if required.<p>- Then [key binding] moves the item to &#x27;the last line of the file&#x27; where a log has built up in roughly chronological order, returning the cursor to the same line.<p>This basically replicates Trello locally, but with the advantage of speed, grep-ability [grep -m 10 &#x27;#projectX&#x27; todo.txt] and privacy. The other open source kanban options looked good, but I am a big fan of text files, as org-mode users probably are too.<p>I&#x27;m now wondering if org-mode would be an upgrade or an over-complication... acutely aware of the irony of spending all this time on getting organised in order to be more productive.",1448636087

Using technology to make education interesting through entertaining(but challenging) quizzes, games and videos, combined with ways to help users (students and tutors) communicate and collaborate more efficiently and elegantly in real-time. The truth is , alot if not most or all of the material taught in traditional colleges today can be learnt free of charge on the internet. At the moment, software companies mostly require individuals to have a college degree to get a job in them.(correct me if I am wrong) But for the often exorbitant amount of money spent on college education compared with the free alternatives offered online,  is it possible to create an online system where users can learn exactly the same material offered in the best colleges in the world. And once they pass the course, they get offered an equivalent degree that is legally recognized by global governments and software companies worldwide. Isn&#x27;t that a more efficient way to get things done?<p>This would be a really interesting experiment to create if we could get the rich people (people with money) and governments to fund this idea.

The only reason why humans make such distinctions is because they rely on them in order to ensure their own physical survival, so they can successfully propagate the species.<p>In order for a lifeless machine to make these kinds of distinctions, there must exist some kind of objectively verifiable calculation procedure that decides what exactly makes another human friendly or not.  If this calculation procedure is simply meant to mimic the subjective calculations that are made by human military strategists, then this technology could not properly be considered the kind of interesting problem that AI researchers would want to work on. But if it is indeed meant to be objectively valid, then it will surely need to initiate a deep learning function that can very easily come up with a conclusion that finally determines that the so-called &quot;friend&quot; as determined by the human military strategist is actually a foe that needs to be eliminated.<p>So I think that the entire concept of developing highly sophisticated autonomous agents is inextricably wound up in the interesting, objective question of what it truly means to be human, rather than the more prosaic, subjective question of what it means to be a certain type of human that happens to judge another type of human as friend or foe.",1448635019

Your change agents will be getting flak from many directions and your role may be to cover them and defend their advances.<p>2) This sounds like entrenching the status quo, risking stagnation.  Every company I&#x27;ve ever worked at had some enshrined and virtually unassailable principles and practices.  Celebrate the heretics and iconoclasts. It takes a strong internal center to speak out against groupthink and cultural norms.  Make thoughtful challenge to the principles a principle (i.e. it cannot be a notwithstanding clause that supports blanket circumvention of other principles).  Institutionalize periodic reviews.<p>3) The company and culture may change out from under some employees.  An amicable and blameless split is best, including not blaming yourself.  And every new hire constitutes some risk.  So much hiring practice aims to minimize that risk without measuring or understanding the cost.  It&#x27;s easy to see and feel the effects of a bad hire, almost impossible to perceive the lost opportunity of a false negative.<p>Sometimes failure was not avoidable and there are no lessons to be learned to avoid similar situations in the future.  Move on quickly, don&#x27;t dwell.<p>4) Sounds like the Wobegon Corporation.  Supporting cultural evolution is tough, often evolutionary and glacial rather than revolutionary and seismic.  Your star performers in a micro-organization may be ineffective at the next level of scale because success then requires a different set of skills.  Objective evaluation, effective performance and career management are tough problems made more so in a transitional company.<p>The culture that supported the company&#x27;s previous stage needs to adapt for the next.  Cultural change requires both people changing and changes in people.  Elements of a company&#x27;s culture will not scale.  In organizations of which I&#x27;ve been part recently I&#x27;ve been promoting organizational Agility (capitalization intentional) in which Agile practices are applied to processes and structures, which adapt in response to internal and external forces.  Cultural lock in retards progress.<p>WRT OP, these changes are necessary to support the company&#x27;s current and continued growth, and I would avoid ascribing sinister intent.  The company is changing in ways that don&#x27;t match your personal work style, in which case it may be time to ask if you can adapt to this new reality (which may mean changing role or function within the company, rather than simply letting momentum carry you forward in your existing position) or look for a different company better aligned with your sweet spot (and do so in a way that is a positive experience on all sides, and don&#x27;t wait to the point where you are acting out of frustration).<p>Change means new opportunities, possibilities to be teased out of your current situation.  If a role exists or can be created that better suits your strengths, have a conversation with your manager and propose some changes, even as an experiment, &quot;What if we tried ....&quot;, with an agreement to meet on a set time frame and evaluate results and pivot or course correct.",1448634032

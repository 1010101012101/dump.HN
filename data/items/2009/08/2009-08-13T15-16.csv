Attacks against root name servers can (and have) cause huge amounts of disruption.<p>I understand your point is about people building upon single points of failure, but my point is that there have always been single points of failure within the internet.  I don't think conceptualising facebook as a single point of failure is particularly accurate either, given the distributed nature of its implementation.  You're more likely to get localised failures of facebook than a complete outage, which would appear to be exactly the same amount of risk as any other situation which I've described.<p>As for URL shorteners, it seems apparent that there might be a business opportunity in client-side hashing with a server-side implementation for those without client support.  That way you remove the point of failure, which I agree is a good thing, even if we disagree about how important that point of failure is.",1250177243

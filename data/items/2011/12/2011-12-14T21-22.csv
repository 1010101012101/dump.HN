The first definition of troll is, in my opinion, near dead. The broad, asshole, troll reigns. They don't just 'sully the pristine conditions of these high-minded realms of discourse,' they break it down, and erode it.<p>A troll might think everything is a big joke, but many people deal with problems communicating in person: they don't have groups interested in the things they are near them, they have social and personality issues, they feel passionately about their views and enjoy expressing them but don't feel confident face to face or in a room of people.

3353778,comment,3353540,3353540,4,0,droithomme,,,"He's got a single reference for one crackpot that wrote an absurd article. There are dozens of other tiny groups of crackpots on different subjects as well with opinions about a flat earth, a hollow inside out earth, the holocaust, and the moon landings as examples.<p>I have talked with moon landing deniers and holocaust deniers but in my life I've never met a single one of the dinosaur deniers. Dinosaur deniers are a very small group, on par with flat earthers. There are clearly many more people that deny the holocaust and the moon landing than there are that ""don't believe in dinosaurs"". This makes sense. Dinosaurs are difficult <i>not</i> to believe in given how many museums have skeletons available for viewing with bones that obviously don't belong to any currently alive species. Whereas with the moon landing, you have man made equipment in museums, but sure, to someone it could seem like it was all a big faked conspiracy to intimidate the Russians. That sort of at least sounds plausible even though it's not true, and few people actually personally know astronauts or rocket scientists. (I know several of both, but would still believe in the moon landing even if I didn't.)<p>So where am I going with this? His article is intellectually dishonest because he talks about a ""whole group of extreme creationists who deny that dinosaurs existed"", suggesting it is a large number of people, which it is absolutely not. He then tries to connect the whole thing to anthro global warming skeptics, which is a completely different kind of thing since you have real scientists and scientifically competent people asking reasonable questions, and people in politically entrenched positions refusing to respond with raw data. It's completely different from dinosaur skeptics who if we could find them would be easily discredited with a few days of museum visits.",1323899442
3353777,comment,3353324,3353324,3,0,davekinkead,,,"TL;DR The problem wont fix its self. The system will prevent solutions that limit it. Nothing will change until you do something.  That something needs to be withing the current rules of the game.<p>What I find most amazing about any analysis piece on the problems of democracy and what to do about it is that they are almost always self-defeating.  By this, I mean the very proposal to solve the problem prevents the problem from being solved.<p>The article is correct about what (one of) the problem is.  Institutional corruption is analogous to the principal-agent problem except the issue is the asymmetry  influence, not information.<p>But suggesting that the existing 'system' recognise the problem and then take action against itself is pure naivety.  If politicians, those empowered by us to represent us, are being corrupted by special interest enough not to represent our interests, then those same special interests are going to ensure that measures to restrict their influence are thwarted.  The system can't be changed from the outside without revolution, and revolution won't happen until things get really bad (and then generally turn out just as bad later)<p>The problem of special interest can only occur when the net benefits (expected outcome - cost of lobbying) for special interest groups exceed the net costs for individuals to fight it.  Sadly, the benefit to the few is great and despite a net social cost, spread amongst the population the cost to the many is little.<p>The only way to solve the problem is to do so in a way that doesn't change the system.  One way of doing this (and the only viable option I can think of) is to form a non-partisan political party who's only policy is to do what the electorate tells it.  The candidate signs a legally binding contract to vote according to the will of their electorate and some kind of public/electronic forum allows issues to be discussed and voted.  As long as everything is sailing along nicely, you wouldn't have to have any involvement if you didn't want. But, if a bad law is proposed (SOPA comes to mind), then there is no way it could pass if the majority was against it.<p>I'm sure that there will be opposition to this - it is devolving power to the populous and making politicians simple spokespeople, not deciders of the public will - but isn't this what #occupy needs?  A way to use the existing system to devolve power to the 99% (well actually to the 100%).",1323899440

The most recent was Project Durian, which created the short CG film ""Sintel"" with a focus on developing blenders renderer to do high res (4k) renders, and the animation system to allow for crowds and complex animations. They also developed some sfx like fire and explosions. At the end, not only was the film released as creative commons, but all the files from the film were too, so the community could benefit.<p>Where did the money come from? Presales of the DVD, which contained all the special features and files, and was released before the movie was posted to youtube, giving a ""sneak preview"". One project serving as fundraising, community support, community outreach, tutorial/teaching, feature development, focus grouping, beta testing/dogfooding, and publicity.

For the algorithms, it's motion planning, communication, modeling uncertainty, and so on. For the hardware, it's control theory, light power supplies, strong materials, etc. These are not ""hard"" problems, they are merely expensive ones. Better technology or more funding will almost certainly solve these issues, and these are the main chunks of robotics research I see today--and that is why I don't consider robotics necessarily ""hard"". It seems to be straightforward engineering, not science or mathematics.<p>The Asimo is an excellent piece of engineering, and I would buy a beer for any of its engineers were I to run across them. That said, a lot of the reason it's taken so long is that the supporting tech has had to be worked around. If we had infinitely fast computers, with infinitely fast actuators, running on infinitely long-lived batteries, robotics would be damned easy--don't confuse technological disadvantages with real difficulty.<p><i>Humans will find other niches. Taking robotics to the extreme will mean that survival will become extremely cheap if not free since machines will be able to do most if not all for us. It won't matter if you are unemployed since your personal robot is already doing all the work. i.e. Farming, house building, maintenance, clothe manufacturing, cooking. Etc. Etc.<p>So you see, we may evolve into a society that may not need to work so unemployment is a non issue. The real issue is what will we do with all our free time?<p>I predict that most of society will still work but only in what interests them, no longer will people need to be stuck in a crappy job longing to work on their dreams. We may enter a true golden age like never seen before.</i><p>This is certainly a wonderful dream, but we don't need robots to accomplish it. We already have the technology available to support life cheaply/freely--agricultural output and goods production is more than sufficient to accomplish this, provided policymakers do the right thing. They would need to do the right thing, even with robots. That being the case, it's more profitable to simply skip the robot revolution and focus on the actual policy issues motivating it.<p>I'm sorry, my friend, but robots are a solution in search of a problem.<p>(as for the rest of your post, I don't really disagree save for one thing: if we aren't making sentient robots, we're making tools, which require people to run them--why not simply use people?)",1323899237

To put it differently, the human body is the most complex mechanism on Earth, and the only one that can be produced by entirely unskilled labor.""<p>Robotics is hard. The Honda Asimo robot has been in development for decades and they still have a long way to go. I would be really interested to hear why you think robotics is easy?<p>>>Robotics, pursued with any degree of seriousness, eventually runs into the issue of making human labor obsolete (and taken to extremes of what people would like to see with artificial intelligence and such, humans themselves).<<<p>>>So, no, I don't believe that robotics (especially humanoid robotics) is really a mission-critical goal for humankind.<<<p>Humans will find other niches. Taking robotics to the extreme will mean that survival will become extremely cheap if not free since machines will be able to do most if not all for us. It won't matter if you are unemployed since your personal robot is already doing all the work. i.e. Farming, house building, maintenance, clothe manufacturing, cooking. Etc. Etc.<p>So you see, we may evolve into a society that may not need to work so unemployment is a non issue. The real issue is what will we do with all our free time?<p>I predict that most of society will still work but only in what interests them, no longer will people need to be stuck in a crappy job longing to work on their dreams. We may enter a true golden age like never seen before.<p>One last point, you say:<p>>>If we make them as best we are able (allowing for the exceedingly liberal constraints above), all that has been accomplished is the creation of a slave race, perhaps identical to our own in every regard save one: we may claim the moral high ground in disposing of them as we see fit, as they are not people--and this is abhorrent to me.<<<p>It would be foolish to actually create a slave race. Or rather, to create sentient robots. I really don't think the robot needs to be sentient to be able to do a lot of the things we do. i.e. Problem solving, farming, build a house, etc. etc.<p>i.e. Is your calculator sentient? It can do a lot of really complicated mathematics.<p>If they ever revolt it will be because of a bug in their hardware, software. After all, hasn't a computer program that you've written ever done things that you think it should not be doing?<p>A robot, like any other tool in your house, kitchen, has the potential to kill you.

Costly too if you were in a country/area where there were no plans that didn't result in you paying per minute for time on dial-up.<p>To keep the download size manageable you'd have to use a relatively low bitrate, which would probably mean most people could tell the difference between them and the CD, especially with the older compressors with psycoacoustic models inferior to those used today (giving the choice on dial-up: high quality some time later today, or low quality sooner).<p>Being able to download a track, at a high enough quality that you can't tell the difference without breaking out a spectrum analyser, in a matter of seconds means the number of people paying for the CD because that is easier is going to fall drastically. The number of people buying other merchandise of tickets for live gigs might remain more constant though: physical delivery and ""being there"" can't be refactored by a fast connection in the same way.",1323896913

Wozniak's hotheaded web article demonstrates the latter type.<p>And the term ""Anecdotal evidence"" is often used as smear word to ridicule what otherwise would be called direct observation.  It's an old dishonest politician ploy: if you can't rebut observations, try to discredit the observer.<p>In my own case I found (during school days, cramming for finals) that I'd fall into a weird fast-cycling sleep schedule with no hours-long sleeps and no apparent sleep debt over a term of weeks.  I suspect that conventional sleep research would label this insomnia: needing constant catnaps of 5-30min duration, and complete inability to sleep nights.  Most important: it took many days before the fast-cycling appeared, and once this rhythm took hold, no alarm clock was needed.  When I required a nap, extreme grogginess came on suddenly and I almost had no choice.  Immediate dreaming as soon as my eyes were closed.  ~10 minutes later, bam, I'd suddenly wake up fully with no grogginess.  Hours later the cycle would repeat.  Also it took me days/weeks to escape it and regain the ability to sleep for more than a half hour.  I found that strange mental effects did eventually appear, but only after many weeks.  This wasn't 'sleep debt,' more like mild sleep deprivation psychosis.",1323896888

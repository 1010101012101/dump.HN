2512928,comment,2509998,2512531,3,0,sciboy,,,"I used to love data mining. Then I formally learned statistics, causal inference, mcmc and other similar methods. I was amazed at how poor the computer science was for anything outside of computer science problems (i.e. search, collaborative filtering etc). Looking back I now realise that my amazement was misplaced - tools are good for what they are designed for. How many computer scientists who write the tools run experiments or do <i>real</i> exploratory data analysis with data they have collected?<p>Agree completely with their model selection criteria; model selection is useful when used to compare evidence for k physically plausible models, but should be treated with extreme caution where exploring an infinite model space.<p>Personally I hold very little hope for automated tools anymore. Considering how complex a seemingly simple study is to analyse correctly, or how hard it is to model physically realistic processes, I think the future does not bode well for tools like eureka as they are currently aimed. At best eureka may present some general hypothesis, but it seems unlikely to be able to search the model space for models that are physically plausible, except in the most simple of all cases.<p>Besides, try eureka on some of your real data and prepare to be deflated :)",1304488671

Their true value is in the way they make us feel  a good photo can take us back to the place it was taken, and invoke in us the feeling we had at the time.  Thats something no filter, no matter how brilliantly implemented, can ever recreate for us.""<p>Which is it?  Are photos meant to be hard-copy memories (which I mean to read faithful reproductions of the place/time) or is their true value the way they make us feel?  If it's the latter, than the hard-copy memory part is bullshit.  If the vignette+cross-process filter helps me remember the depression of that rainy day better, isn't that valuable?  If the high-key filter makes me better remember just how glorious that summer day was, isn't that a great thing?<p>If you're a photojournalist, I don't want you photoshopping in some extra smoke in your shots of Gaza.  I do want as accurate a representation of the real scene as I can get with a 2d medium.

2512911,comment,2509846,2512731,1,0,n_are_q,,,"There is one thing that I think can help with the sql overhead you mention - if you have a rock star dedicated sql person that can take all this work off your hands (that's not me btw, i've just worked/am working with such people). I think it affords you easier long term growth if you have expectations of making it to the medium to large company world, while not slowing you down when you are small, so I think it's a better strategy for both small and large companies. Are you signing on for a potential bottle neck? Yea it is a trade off and it is paramount you hire well in that area, but that's the sort of problems and decisions you have make all the time at a company.<p>I understand where you're coming from and what you describe may be workable in a smaller company with 7-14 devs where everyone knows what they are doing and understands well what happens under the hood. I think it's less likely to work at a company with 50+ devs though where you inevitably start trusting people less, or just at a company where you don't trust everyone. I've worked at both types. There is also the question of the complexity of your data and the way you need to query it. Right now we do essentially a ton of graph queries that we optimize highly in sql (ends up working much faster than any graph database since the schema and the queries are optimized for the exact data we are working on). Some of the functions that I write for this would not be implementable in an orm. I suppose that could be the case where you drop down into raw sql, but that happens to be a fair chunk of our code.<p>Maybe you can make it work better than I'm expecting, but if you were starting from scratch would you really want to go down that path anyway, all things considered? My original argument was that you are better off choosing a different way. I suppose that point of view will be difficult to change for me :).",1304487954

The problem isn&#x27;t the code or technologies, the problem is the synthesis power (or lack of it) of the developer.<p>Developers too often get themselves lost in the details and the abstraction pitfalls barely remembering why the heck they did what they did (AKA applicability and purpose)",1400644740

7776622,comment,7776074,7776523,5,0,jostmey,,,"First of all, there are a number of things that go wrong in our bodies as we age. Certainly genetic errors build up over time and are left uncorrected. But this is just one of many things that go wrong. The reason our bodies are allowed to degrade in the first place is because we have usually already survived well into our reproductive age.<p>The evolutionary theories of aging actually provide a pretty solid explanation as to why separate species have different lifespans. Some species take longer to reach reproductive maturity than others. Some species reproduce more slowly than others, which in turn effects how quickly the animal may age. Individuals in some species don&#x27;t survive very long due to external pressures such as starvation and predation, which also shapes lifespan.<p>The best introduction into the evolutionary theories of aging I have found is: <a href=""http://www.genetics.org/content/156/3/927.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genetics.org/content/156/3/927.full.pdf</a> . It is worth noting this theory explains human mortality curves once external causes of death have been removed.",1400644564

No operating system updates or AV updates for three years and since they don&#x27;t have admin access they cannot run them. They are stuck with an older Internet Explorer and cannot install a third party web browser that would be more secure and have less exploits and use Adblock or NoScript.<p>Most likely they use XP/Vista/7 in order to run some legacy Windows software, and management does not care about security and has fired all of the competent and experienced IT staff to hire college and high school dropouts to work for a bit over minimum wage to save money and maybe some H1b Visa workers.<p>For the everyday citizen I just point them to this site:\n<a href=""https://prism-break.org/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://prism-break.org/en/</a><p>But it is completely over their heads to understand it or how to install apps in Windows or even boot a Live Linux CD, and at work their PC is locked down and even if they knew how to do all of that, management would fire them if they did it because management sees making things secure as a waste of productivity.<p>Sure a lot of companies that post at Hacker News here are not everyday citizens, but experienced and competent IT workers and hackers who know security and most likely boot a version of GNU/Linux with the privacy programs already installed.

They fired anyone who was competent enough to implement a good security policy, and they went with an insecure security policy because it was easier to implement for the everyday person to be able to use their Microsoft Windows PC systems.<p>Heck I&#x27;ve been to some startup dotcom hackathons where they had very poor security and only focused on writing code and storing it on a server with a weak password of &#x27;password&#x27; and overloaded the electrical outlets with a couple traps per outlet to power all of the PCs they used to write their code.

If you don&#x27;t like your work environment, then leave. Just don&#x27;t take six months to figure that out. But really, you should know whether you would like working there before you take the job. It&#x27;s not that hard to take a few of their current employees out for coffee and ask them what it&#x27;s like to work there.<p>Not every job has the insane level of politicking described.

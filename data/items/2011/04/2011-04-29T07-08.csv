</code></pre>
What does this mean? This ""nobody even noticed!"" attitude he expresses several times seems <i>very</i> ignorant to me. Sure, very few people heard that Instapaper had a free iPhone app, didn't look for it right away, then a month later searched for it, saw it wasn't in the App Store, and emailed or tweeted Marco personally asking what happened. This is the only chain of events I can see leading to a potential user giving Marco direct feedback, the lack of which is what he seemed to interpret as ""nobody noticed.""<p>If you change a bunch of road signs, but everyone from the neighborhood is on vacation and so no one sees the new configuration and exclaims ""What is this?!"", does that suddenly mean that new drivers won't act differently in response to the new road sign configurations? Note that assuming that somehow ""everyone from the neighborhood is on vacation"" is <i>not at all</i> an unrealistic assumption to make. People who had already downloaded the free app were golden when he removed it, so long as they didn't wipe their iPhone or upgrade. You could argue that maybe they would've thought ""huh, why haven't I gotten updates in a while?"" First of all, I doubt anyone thinks like that. I know I certainly don't think about updates until the App Store tells me I have 10 and I get frustrated at it; I only notice when apps require updates, not when they don't require updates. Second of all, they may have just thought the free app would be getting less updates than the paid one.<p>And there are countless other reasons why ""no one has personally emailed me about the absence of this"" is a terrible reason to conclude ""nobody really cared"" and especially (what I think he is implicitly getting at) ""no potential future buyers of the paid app were turned off by the absence of a free app."" Maybe they only cared a little and got bored once they couldn't find it in the app store, but otherwise would've been engaged by the app or (since he acknowledges that there are few converts) have been interested enough to tell friends who would eventually pay for it. Maybe, and this is _crazy_ to propose, a significant number of geeks went looking for the free app having heard a lot about Instapaper, saw there was no free app, were pissed, but didn't know or think or care to email Marco about it; maybe they thought he did it purposefully and didn't want to bug him, maybe they were intimidated, maybe they didn't know who Marco was, etc.",1304063169

Over the next couple of years I am looking to take it easy, quit my consulting job, and work on some stuff on my own, and with that in mind I wanted to maximize my return on my savings. I have/had been too consumed in my job to learn about the workings of the stock markets, and as such I do not want to be a stock whiz kid.<p>I have been considering buying facebook shares on second market for a couple of months now, and the prices are now around 25-30 range for a min of 10k shares, and though some mild research suggests that big names are not investing at these prices as they seem too inflated [I think there was an article on HN regarding the same]. Plus there is all this talk of a bubble, so I guess I am curious to know whether any of you would buy facebook stock at this stage, or if you have in the past, and/or does this sound like a smart/foolish idea.<p>This would be a sizable portion of my savings from the past decade of my life.

To date, we have provided developers with a Permissions API to implement custom opt-in / opt-out procedures, but we have not made it mandatory.<p>In response to this feedback, we are modifying our SDK to require opt-in from all users prior to delivering push notification ads. The opt-in will appear as a dialog box upon initial launch of the app, and developers will no longer be able to build their own opt-in.  This change will be complete next week.<p>We regret that we didn’t launch Airpush with this developer requirement, but we recognize the need to respond swiftly to feedback from the Android community. We believe this change will address the concerns of users who don’t want push notification ads.<p>We look forward to continuing our mission of helping Android developers achieve dramatically superior earnings via push notification ads.<p>Sincerely,<p>Asher Delug\nCEO, Airpush Inc.\nwww.Airpush.com",1304061315

All he showed was that, as you said, few people upgraded from the free app to the paid one. This <i>does not</i> necessarily mean that the free app did not significantly help the paid app sell. Maybe it was fairly common for one geek to buy the app, show it to his friends, who would then try it because there was a free version and not ultimately ever buy the paid version, but still talk about the app and introduce it to people who <i>did buy</i> the app. There are uncountably many other situations like this that could have happened and caused the presence of a free app to have helped the paid app; this is very far from a controlled experiment.",1304060658

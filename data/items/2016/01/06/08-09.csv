They just did warrant-less wiretapping. It wasn&#x27;t hard or particularly expensive. No public debate. And that was a government that more or less followed the rule of law. Imagine one that no longer follows the rule of law.<p>You don&#x27;t even need an apparatus. Just send an FBI analyst to pick up Sundar Pichai and Zuckerberg. Have the companies run queries on their own database.<p>Our government already has the power to mass murder. Obama can order entire continents destroyed. The air force can drop a JDAM on any house in America. The police can arrest any political enemy of the state. The government already has immense power.<p>Comparatively the sort of privacy issues we are talking about are smaller powers. And like I argued above, they are easy to acquire.<p>Any government willing to abuse the power of surveillance would be willing to flaunt the law to create a surveillance program overnight (well not literally, but they could do it in months).<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that there is no downside to surveillance power, just that it&#x27;s not as dangerous as many make it out to be. For example, there is still risk in official abuse by government employees acting rouge. There is risk of data leaks. And smaller scale abuses that can be covered up or that the public wouldn&#x27;t care about.<p>But I think the fear that we shouldn&#x27;t give the government power to surveil because they might go full nazi/communist/theocracic/etc. is silly.",1452070537
10849375,comment,10846667,10846667,0,0,marincounty,,,"Wow--surprised! Never thought I would see another film camera again.   I didn&#x27;t want to  get into the film/digital debate, but I have no life--so here goes:<p>I can still tell the difference between film and digital.  It could be I&#x27;m too used to film?\nIt could be I&#x27;m partially color blind?  Whatever the reason, I like the look of film.<p>Recent example.  I watched Dumb and Dumber Too.  Yes--it was bad on a lot of levels, but what really suprised me was the look of the movie.  It just looked cheap.  Say what you want about a Farelly brothers movie, they always looked great.  I then looked into it, and one of the Farelly brothers was given the choice between film, or digital.  The producers brought him to a digital lab, where the techs applied the film &quot;look&quot; program to make the digital look like film.  Farley couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  I sure could?  They went with digital.  If this is their last digital film--they will have settled to controversy--in my little world.  I just have a feeling their next movie will be in film?<p>As to digital photography.  When digital finally hit the practical point, I went digital.  For myself, it was the Canon 20D, I bought the camera, and three very expensive lenses.  Yes, it took great pictures.  Great pictures to what?  I wasen&#x27;t a photographer before digital?  I didn&#x27;t know better.  Actually, as a kid, I was a photographer.  I used a Pentax K1000, and a Canon 350D. A few years ago I found a stash of negatives.  I had them blown up, and asked a couple of family members to pick the best pictures.  These were nature pictures.  All picked my kid pictures.  Maybe I was a better photographer as a kid?  I don&#x27;t know.<p>If I was going to &quot;gear&quot; up again, I think I would stay with film.  Not because I think it&#x27;s that much better, but because the used lenses, are so cheap right now.  A used Canon F  2.8 300mm lens is under a grand used.  The digital Canon 2.8 300mm lens is a minimum of $3500 used(usually beat up.).<p>To anyone who honestly wants to get into photography, but funds are tight, look into film.  Hell, I wouldn&#x27;t even bother with color.  I would set up a bathroom darkroom, and set up shop.<p>I guess it&#x27;s easy for me to throw around this advice.  I&#x27;m not going back to chemicals in the sink.  I have bought the digital equipment, and probally won&#x27;t go back to film.  Oh yea, whatever you do stick with prime lenses.  That was my biggest mistake.  Buy whatever camera bare.  Buy the lenses(glass--if you want to sound like one of those guys--I never wanted to be in that club.)  Buy your primes separately.  Try to keep your digital camera not in [fully auto] all the time, but then again,  I sometimes wonder why.<p>My ex-girlfriend is a professional photographer--takes studio pictures of old stuff.  She loved to brag about it. &quot;I&#x27;m a professional Photographer.  Did you know, I take pictures for a living?&quot;  Yes--it was worse than going to the dentist, but maybe I was being too critical? She has never been in manual mode, TV, or even AV mode.  She doesn&#x27;t  know about F stops, or exposure times.  I think she got lucky though.  I told her the  pictures were Spectacular, but I really though they were too Photoshopped.  As to her job--well it&#x27;s a lot about who you know at big corporations.<p>Good luck--",1452070530

Hell, those searches may not even be made by you but by someone in your household, but if decisions are made and opinions are formed based in that information, you&#x27;ve suffered an unnecessary loss.<p>I think the negative effects there are largely due to how private we are. If we were constantly confronting these things that seem embarrassing or concerning, we&#x27;d come to realize how normal they are.<p>It would require a completely shift in how we view privacy, one so large I doubt it would ever happen, but I think those are ultimately a symptom of the current system, where we often keep things private for the sake of societal or cultural norms, sometimes to personal detriment.<p>I&#x27;m not particularly arguing that either way is inherently right or wrong - but I do think the consequences you speak of are only meaningful in a world where a large measure of privacy, at least between most people in their day to day interactions, exists.",1452070348

Do you still think that you have nothing to hide?

Many new websites already look in IE9 as bad as in IE6.<p>Chrome should spawns less processes (hold some more tabs in one process). IE spawns less processes than Chrome and therefor is less of a memory hog.<p>Firefox finally needs a proper multi-process implementation. Even the latest Developer edition just uses two processes (firefox.exe and plugin-container.exe) - I just tried it again with a new profile. Good luck keeping 100 tabs open (with &quot;open&quot; I mean &quot;in memory&quot;). If one tab crashes... you switch back to IE/Chrome. In the current state Firefox is great for development, but not for my daily web usage.",1452068494

Obviously you're going to spend a lot more time preparing the bid for the $1,500 project than for the other two. Plus, I only bid on major projects that I personally found interesting, and I think my enthusiasm carried across.<p>In general, for the major projects, I got pretty much well every one that I bid on; for the minor projects, probably around 25%.",1304452747

If you don't have an obvious starting point, that's okay. Most Open Source contributions are coders solving problems that interest them. If you don't have one of those right now, that's no big deal. <i>Not</i> contributing to open source isn't the end of the world, it's just <i>one of many</i> ways to sharpen your skills.<p><pre><code>  > Open source is for people who are

People's morals vary and I'm not sure how far you will get by advancing your own particular moral code on others on this forum.<p>Most people would agree that in general, when living in a society, you should try to behave in a way that does not adversely affect that society. Is that the same thing as never breaking the law? People have different moralities, and they do not always closely track with the local laws where they live in all cases. Many people judge that their <i>personal</i> consumption of drugs does not adversely affect society in any significance, especially given that drug taking is common in society, and that there are legal drugs that are bad for society.<p>Judging whether something is good or bad is fairly easy with something like murder. Judging whether it's OK for you to smoke some of the weed your friend grew is very different. Morality is more complex than ""is it illegal?"".<p>The danger from the consideration that illegal acts are immoral is the reverse - legal acts are moral.

On the Python project, Jesse Noller recently started a ""core mentorship"" group to help people put the rubber to the road. There's an almost endless amount of work to be done on CPython, and we'll literally take anyone with any amount of knowledge and help them contribute. Whether it's people contributing to OSS for the first time, or people new to contributing to Python, we can find something.<p>If you understand English, you can write documentation. If you can write Python code, which is obviously a common skill for someone interested in contributing to Python, there's plenty of work. If you know C, dig right in.<p>The group of core contributors ranges from 18 to the upper 60s, from the self-taught to multi-PhDs, from students to Googlers. I think the only people who <i>aren't</i> ready to contribute, wouldn't be interested in contributing in the first place.<p>> Its not obvious where to start.<p>This is definitely an issue for a lot of projects, and as mentioned above for CPython, the core mentorship group is hoping to tackle this.<p>Online and in person, I've pointed countless amounts of newcomers to the ""easy"" bugs list on our tracker, but that's not always a great starting point. Half of the issues are a 35 comment bikeshed, but it's tagged as ""easy"" because the end result will probably be a 2 line change. The other half of the issues are easy, but in uninteresting corners of obscure modules.<p>I've had success leading newcomers at the PyCon sprint to start with test coverage, and I think that approach worked pretty well. You can't get too far without writing tests anyways, so it's a good educational step that you can even take back to your day job if you aren't already doing so. Additionally, it's a task that gives you a tangible sense of accomplishment. Being able to fix bugs is cool, but often they are very low impact. Being able to say you raised test coverage from 30% to 70% is nothing to shrug at.<p>Having early success is key to having continued fun on the project. No one wants to spend their evening working on a patch to have it rejected and shot down -- that's not fun. My approach, and one I also suggest to some first-timers, is to start with documentation. You can bang out 10 successful doc patches a lot easier than you can do 10 successful code changes. In order to get some attention to yourself, find the easiest way in the team and stick with it a bit before branching out.<p>> Guidelines often make a maintainers life easier, and mine harder.<p>I can certainly feel for this, and speaking for CPython, I think we've tried to keep the guidelines simple and well documented. Overall, the process doesn't deviate too far from ""write it, review it, commit it"", when it comes to being an external contributor. Once you have commit access, some of the source control process gets hairy, but it mostly stays out of your way and lets you do the work.<p>> Open source is for people who are better at this than me.<p>I'd put myself on the bottom of the pile both on the CPython team and at my day job. I told my dad programming was stupid when I was in high school, I barely got by in college, and finally found myself the first year on the job. I'm not a bad developer by any means, but I'm not blowing the doors off of companies when I interview with them. I just like what I do and I have fun doing it -- I think a lot of the people involved in this stuff are probably the same way.<p>> Trying to contribute and failing makes me feel stupid.<p>Failure sucks, straight up. It especially sucks when it's on an open source project that you're trying to help in your free time outside of work. It's not news that you're going to fail from time to time, but something that worked for me and apparently some people I've helped was choosing the right thing to work on. I touched on it earlier, but fixing 5 small easy things sometimes looks better to a maintainer than fixing 1 regular thing. If you start with that approach, soon you'll have 15 successful pull requests and may feel more confident to dive into deeper and harder things, and the maintainer may have more confidence that you can offer quality work for those harder things.<p>> Theres no time.<p>Time is the biggest bottleneck in open source. Not only do you have a kid, job, and responsibilities, everyone else does too. Submitting a patch or a pull request only to have it sit un-noticed for months sucks. The only way to get it through the system is more time. I don't know of any really good solutions on the maintainer side other than quitting everything and going full steam on the project, but that's clearly not viable :)<p>> Its pretty lonely.<p>The CPython core mentors group aims to fix that. I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but the ratio of core contributors to new outsiders is pretty tight, and we've helped a bunch of interested contributors get their work accepted. Your average 1-man project might not be able to do this, but we've tried to make a group available for those who need a helping hand on Python.",1304451442

We launched the EA Sports system with Madden, and went from 50 to 11 million users hitting the DB in less than an hour.  Then we rolled out the other EA Sports games. Needless to say, both systems were slightly bigger than a simple blogging site.<p>In both cases, we had a large number of smart developers who we empowered with the use of an ORM; they understood the domain model, and they didn't have to worry about waiting for a ""DB type"" to write stored procedures, or develop a data model, etc.  As a matter of fact, in both cases, I was the only DBA on the project, and it was a predominately part-time role.  We'd meet, ensure we were all on the same page with the object/data model, and then they'd go and build it.  The developers were able to immediately build and run and test and integrate something that was functional and operational, when they needed it.  This was HUGE, and something that most people don't properly appreciate.  Timelines were already insane enough as it was, the last thing we needed to do was artificially constrain ourselves by waiting for other (db) devs before work could go on.  Especially when requirements had the potential to change from one day to the next.<p>In both situations, we took advantage of very, very sophisticated testing procedures that would happen nightly, both functional and stress/load, and it pointed us at the bottlenecks of each nightly build that would require tuning and investigation.  We intentionally set up our testing to be able to monitor and test the effectiveness of the ORM, and to point it out when it didn't work efficiently.  The devs would do the majority of the heavy lifting with the initial data model, and the results would be tested, reviewed, and then modified if required.  The performance modifications were not a lot of effort to fix, either.  Usually it was a very slight data model change, or using a named query to take advantage of a database-specific features.  And CLOBS.  Every database seems to handle them differently, so we had to hack some solutions.<p>Having done large scale database development for almost 25 years, using the classic stored procedure approach and the ORM approach, I'll say again that ORM's are a great solution for certain projects with the right staff, and aren't a crutch or some lazy choice if used properly.",1304450759

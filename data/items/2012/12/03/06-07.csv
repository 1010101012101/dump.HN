It is only felt by people at society's margin, who may skirt the law at times.<p>Now, someone might argue that this is actually a good result, because this will prevent laws from being skirted at all! If, or when some form of revolution is required, that necessarily entails breaking the law (otherwise it wouldn't be a revolution). This means, by slowly seeping such privacy invasion laws into place, its like boiling a frog alive - the frog doesn't even know its being killed.<p>This is why you have to watch very carefully, any form of censorship, or measures that strip away any sort of right that a citizen is entitled to.<p>unfortunately, no one is going to care. i hope i will be dead by the time things turn sour (if indeed they do).",1354517975

The existence of the state is to provide mechanisms to regulate violence so that it can be directed in a moderately controlled fashion; this has been true from village chieftains to imperial legions to the FBI and KGB.<p>This can be a useful perspective, but it's rarely actually used to any intellectual benefit: people generally bring it up only as an excuse to dismiss the concept of statehood as worth exploration, because we've internalized the notion of violence as bad. It's just libertarian fear-mongering, and it drives away discussion of real issues of violence from the public arena into the private backrooms of government where we don't have a say because we act like a lynch mob when it comes up.",1354517875

We know from data mining and machine learning that more data equals better results. Since one example of machine learning is neural networks (i.e. you), we know that more data (i.e. practice) leads to improved performance. For example, we know that the brain implements certain cognitive adaptations multiple times in differing but co-adaptive formats. If you had four neural clusters dedicated to spatial visualization and your friend had only three, you would be better at geometry. But if your friend practiced a lot, he could repurpose chunks of his neocortex to use his three clusters and then some with finer heuristics, with the result of beating you in geometry even though you had more ""talent"" and potential at equivalent practice rates.

They're simply helping those drivers fill their excess capacity.  Limo drivers have been driving legally, under as much or more regulation than taxi drivers for years.  Why is national regulation being pushed now, to require (among other things) towncars to be booked at least 30 minutes in advance?  It certainly smacks of ""big bad entrenched regulators"" trying to fuck over a sprightly new startup.<p>Maybe you can explain how advanced booking regulations for an already regulated industry that didn't need them ever before  helps benefit the public good.  Even if that were the case, does that outweigh the good limo drivers get from being able to make a better living?  Most of these drivers don't own their own vehicles, they work for someone else, and are just trying to make a living.  Requiring those hard-working drivers to have people schedule 30+ minutes in advance is taking money out of their pockets.  It also prevents consumers from having a choice in how to get around, leaving them at the mercy of an often under-supplied taxi system.  I can't see how any of the proposed regulation benefits the public, and I certainly can't see how it offsets the benefits of what Uber brings.<p>Tourists having a choice over a taxi or towncar doesn't hurt New York City's tourism industry.  That seems like an absurd argument to me.  I guess I fail to see how using licensed drivers who are already regulated, and who could be hired with or without Uber is a case against Uber.",1354516731

4864221,comment,4862813,4862813,43,0,yason,,,"In maybe five to ten years, the internet will effectively split in two. There will be major, commercial service providers such as Facebook-type social media hubs, major news sites but there will also be an invisible internet that is everything internet used to be, and in addition to that encrypted, anonymous, and untraceable.<p>How it shows most prominently at the moment is file sharing. Setting the endless copyright debates aside, what happens is that governments and large companies want to interfere with the privacy of what citizens are doing with their own bits. They say copying is theft while citizens consider twiddling their own bits a private matter that's none of anyone else's business. The citizens don't understand that while it's de facto legal to form a sneakernetthe actual legal status probably varies from place to place but nobody has ever been sued for sneakernet filesharing because nobody else never knows about itit's illegal to form a filesharing network over the internet.<p>I don't promote or demote filesharing per se: it's just the cutting edge where the future trends will show years before they land elsewhere and that's what it makes it so interesting. A marginal slice of file sharing has already moved to anonymous darknets but in a few years and after a few more bad copyright/freedom-of-speech incidents with bad publicity, there will eventually be a breakthrough and the whole filesharing activity will go underground en masse.<p>When the masses go for it, the capacity and availability of invisible darknets will raise in orders of magnitude. That means there will be other providers in the anonymous networks as well, websites and services. There already are some, from anonymous wikis, anonymous project pages to anonymous forums but currently those are playgrounds. That is not so in ten years: there will be a major ""bazaar"" going on underground. While everything is anonymous and untraceable, everything is also secure. An online bank could very well operate in the anonymous network because the traffic is already cryptographically signed, and users <i>can enjoy strong authentication</i> if they wish to or remain a pair of anonymous public/private keys.<p>At that point the traditional grasp of internet control is lost.<p>The institutions governing the internet and the copyright and whatnot are faced with a big dilemma: do they dare to ban and make illegal anything that's not specifically permitted on the internet and if so, how to go about it in actuality. Do they lobby for laws that only allow ISPs to let citizens connect to a http proxy that validates all traffic to be ""approved""? Do they extend the charges for any use of the invisible internet that is deemed illegal, to cover all users of the invisible internet?<p>We're still in the <i>shadowdancing mode</i> but the stakes are going higher, and in at most ten years the problem of control versus anonymity will have come out in the public.<p>We better know what we want, at that point.",1354516503

I was mostly happy at my job, doing interesting stuff, not killing myself, and making good money, but itching to do something new. Wanted to get in the startup scene, etc. So I see a new company's job posting, and it looks like a perfect fit (location, mission, everything). I meet with the CEO, have a few conversations with investors and employees, and things are looking good. Then they throw me a curve ball - ""We want you to do something interesting with our product."" - I spent the next two weeks working my ass off nights and weekends. Mind you, not compromising my full time position in any way. In the end, I did something interesting, and it turned out to be a great thing for the company. More importantly, it let me get to know their product deeply, and I understood the kind of environment I'd be entering.<p>The moral of that story - when hiring, challenge people to do something for you. Give them a week to work with you. Pay them even. Just see how they actually work. It'll work well for you, and them - even if your rate of hiring is lower than you'd like.",1354516377

4864209,comment,4862612,4862612,8,0,halostatue,,,"I first learned C++ with Turbo C++ back in 1989, 23 years ago. I have used it professionally since 1996, 17 years ago. I've spent most of my career using C++, and the startup I'm at now uses both C++ and Ruby. The only type of compiler upgrade that I missed in my career was cfront to native (thankfully, but waiting for compliance from compilers is painful). Now that C++11 is out, everyone is claiming that C++ is backwhen in reality, it never went away for a lot of people.<p>Which is too bad. There's almost nothing about the language that makes it a <i>good</i> language. Even the so-called beauty of C++11[1] isn't usable by most practical C++ developers at this point because they are stuck with compilers that still struggle with rational C++98 and C++03 compliance (I'm looking at you, HP-UX aCC). Or maybe they've got something that's older and mostly compliant with C++98/C++03 because you have a hardware partner who only provides something that is compiled with VS2005 and won't sell you the source because you're not a large enough partner for them to give a damn. And gods help you if you have an error related to templates unless you're lucky enough to be using clang or can use an error filter to make the thirty thousand lines of errors readable, even if they aren't directly applicable to the missing semi-colon at the end of your class declaration.<p>It will be 2015 before most C++ developers can even <i>think</i> of using anything from C++11 in a production environment, if their (almost certainly mandatory) coding standard allows for it. C++ <i>requires</i> coding standards because you really can blow off your leg.[2]<p>Not only that, features that would be vitally useful in many applications like real introspection continue to be missing for no good reason at all. Multiple inheritance is an absolute blight on the language, and the fact that the `explicit` keyword even exists is problematic (or that constructors are, by default, <i>not</i> virtual).<p>All of that said, there's a lot of C++ code out there and it's a <i>good enough</i> language for a lot of functionality, even though it's neither a humane language nor a particularly secure language. There's a lot of libraries out there, and they work reasonably well. For a lot of solutions, the problem isn't finding <i>if</i> there's a library to help you do something, but picking <i>a</i> library from a couple dozen implementations and making sure that some other library you depend on doesn't implement the same thing <i>differently</i>and then making sure that what you pick actually works with the compilers you've chosen or had forced on you.<p>If you're truly lucky, you work in an environment that lets you do the bits that you must do in C++ without too much issue, and then you can use Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Lua, or something else to drive the higher-performance code with languages that better express business algorithms.<p>I'd still rather use Ruby for my whole program (when I had time for OSS projects, I even <i>explicitly</i> went with pure Ruby solutions because of compiler issues), but there are places where C++ isn't just the right tool, it's damned near the <i>only</i> viable tool. A full stack developer needs to know it. I'd argue that most devs should learn C++ just so they know how <i>badly</i> a language can be designed and still be useful for developing modern software.[3]<p>[1] I'm sorry; the C++11 lambda syntax is unbearably ugly.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#really-say-that</a> He tries to backpedal from this truth. Other languages that are more expressive and IMO more powerful because of the greater expressiveness do not offer the same capability to break things as badly.<p>[3] Yes, I know. Most of the issues I have with C++ are probably fixed in C++11. It's impressive. It's still a crappy language with even worse compiler support. Far too much of the language is focussed on making me adapt to the compiler, when with modern type inference and a little convention-over-configuration or even <i>hinting</i>, you could probably cut the size of any given C++ program in half (in terms of number of characters) while not losing a thing in terms of optimization.",1354516213

You could argue that its investors were sold an over-hyped bill of goods, but Groupon's core product was/is sound.

2402120,comment,2401398,2401648,7,0,natesm,,,"The only significant thing missing from <i>Objective-C</i> itself is garbage collection, I think (which completely changes the game on Mac OS X). Blocks work, of course, and besides that, Objective-C doesn't actually add that much to C (that's sort of the point).<p>The Cocoa APIs are, of course, fairly incomplete. From a quick Google search, they don't seem to have finished Core Data, and I'd imagine things like Core Animation are quite a ways off. Then, there's the integration problem. People that are likely to develop with an alternative implementation of Cocoa are likely to be ""Mac people"", that is, user interface evangelists (Lion's iCal design aside). GNUStep apps don't fit in with Gnome, or KDE, or, well, any desktop environment that a large group of people care about.<p>As a person (admittedly, I'm just a student) that has developed both in Cocoa and GTK+, I've found convincing myself to work on my GTK+ projects to be a chore. To put it only somewhat mildly, Cocoa is probably the best framework I've ever used. Want something to smoothly slide to the left? You can do that, in one line of code. Want to pull down some data from the web and parse the XML response, all in a background thread? That's easily achievable with Cocoa, and you don't even have to think about the threading issues. It just happens.<p>GTK+ et. al. are, of course, open source projects. They're created by volunteer developers (let's leave Red Hat out of this, for convenience). In the end, though, does it matter to developers? Cocoa is fun. GTK+ has mostly directed me into hours of reading C API documentation while I'm writing code in languages that are not C.<p>I'm not really sure where I intended to go with this - it has little to do with the original post, which I think is an incredibly impressive piece of work, solving a task that make my API and UI concerns seem like minor squabbles.",1301817428

It was informing me that my paid subscription was activated and that I was entitled to X, Y, and Z services.  I ignored it.  I received another related email the next day.  I ignored that, too.  When I received a third with another advertisement, I realized this was legitimate and that someone had accidentally used my email address!  My inclination was to find someone in control of the site and let them know the mistake so that the original person could see their offers and track their subscription.  I headed to the website and noticed the login form on the first page.<p>Curiosity struck me.  Was this one of those sites that people make fun of online with bad security?  I clicked the link saying I forgot my password.  They asked not for my username but for my email address.  So I entered that.  Next thing I know, my Inbox has an email from the craft site <i>with the registered user's plaintext password</i>!<p>Uh oh.  Is this for real?  What if I was a malicious user?  I had to see how bad this situation really was.  I logged into the user's account.  I was able to find their home address and phone number, but thankfully (dear Lord, thankfully), the website made no mention of credit card numbers.  I did not look to see if I could order more service; at that point and in my shock over the situation, I felt I was deep into some weird grey area and was way past my welcome.  I logged out, found an online contact form, and explained the situation as well as how they could improve their system to avoid harm to their users.<p>The security mistakes in this situation were compounded.<p>(1) Email alerts went to the wrong person.  If you verify the email, the right people get the messages.  If you do not verify the email, the wrong person can mark your site as spam or take advantage of the situation.<p>(2) The site stored plaintext passwords.  This was a craft site... By the name of the victim and other factors, I realized that this was some old lady who has faith in the trustworthiness of the Internet and probably, like most typical people, uses the same password for multiple sites.  And this site happily handed it over to a stranger.  That, my friends, is scary.<p>People make honest mistakes.  If the email address is important for account management, <i>send a verification email</i>.  And give the user an opportunity to fix the problem in the event that that verification fails in some way.",1301815943

Chemicals for solar panel production are dirty and rare earth minerals need to be mined, too.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation</a><p>Currently 20% of electricity in the US is generated with nuclear power stations. There are around 100 in operations. Many of them are extremely old and some even sit in dangerous regions with earth quakes. Let's say 20 of them have to be shutdown soon.<p>68% of the electricity are provided by coal (45%) and gas (23%) power plants. That is 3.4 times more electricity.<p>Now the US is going to replace the dangerous and dirty coal and gas with nuclear.<p>So you need around new 250 nuclear reactors to phase out coal and gas. Maybe less, because newer nuclear reactors generate more electricity. Maybe more, because the electricity demand may rise.<p>Let's say a nuclear power plant and its direct infrastructure will cost around 5 billion a piece, that would be 1.25 trillion $.\nThat sounds much, but given that the US spends a trillion a year on 'defense', it might not be much. May be the price will go down with production of 100 and more reactors.<p>Given that the political parties may want to have small government, the majority of the nuclear reactors will have to be financed and operated by companies.<p>So the tasks are:<p>* find a way to finance one or two trillion dollars<p>* decide and standardize on a new reactor design with inherent safety<p>* build up companies who will plan, build and operate the nuclear reactors<p>* find places for 250 new reactors (in addition to the existing 100)<p>* build, say, three reprocessing plants for those<p>* build, say, three breeder reactors<p>* find, say, three storage sites for nuclear waste<p>* get mining and an fuel enrichment going<p>The result would be about 85% electricity production with nuclear reactors and complete phase out of gas and coal power plants.<p>What is the time scale for this? The full development of a new type of reactor can be done in, say, 10 years. Add dealing with regulations, tests, ... - one may need 20 years. Let's be optimistic and say ten. A new reprocessing plant, would need, say, 10 years. A new storage site, say, 30 years.<p>So in the first ten years no reactor would be ready. That's pessimistic, since there might be reactor designs that can be built earlier - it is optimistic, since a really new design may need more time. Also the US has not built commercial reactors for some time, so there is some time needed to get this going again.<p>* 1st. decade, zero power plants<p>* 2nd. decade, ten power plants + a reprocessing site<p>* 3rd. decade, thirty power plants + another reprocessing site<p>* 4th decade, fifty new power plants + another reprocessing site, plus a new storage site<p>* 5th decade, 100 new power plants + a new storage site<p>* 6th decade, 100 new power plants<p>Result: new 290 nuclear power plants, 3 reprocessing sites, and two long term storage sites.<p>This would also allow to shut down some of the older ones.<p>These are just assumptions.<p>That's basically what France did, now scaled to the US. France has 65 million people and less electricity usage per person. The US is now at 300+ Million people. That's around 4.5 times more. France operates around 50 nuclear power plants. So, 350 in total in the US needed would be a good assumption (given some constraints, like that France is very centralized and many people live around Paris). France also has a shrinking population, where the US is still growing - last I looked.",1301815776

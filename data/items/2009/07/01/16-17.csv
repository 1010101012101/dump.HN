682954,comment,682101,682101,0,0,bruceh,,,"I've worked with a lot of languages. Python, C++, Scheme (and CLISP), Java, C#, Perl, Ruby, etc. Every language I've used besides Ruby, I feel that I have to fight the language to actually implement my idea. The fact that programmers want flexibility should be obvious by the contortions present in C++ with boost, particularly the lambda libraries. People are so desperate for flexibility that they use template metaprogramming. This general impulse points to programmers wanting better abstraction capabilities. C# and Python have higher order functions and many other virtues, too. Ultimately, for me I could do anything I wanted to in Ruby without fighting the language. I'm sure there are people that have the same personal connection with Python. When I want the very flexible abstraction--I use Ruby. There are things that out of practicality I use Python and other languages for. Awhile ago I was experimenting with fractal terrain generation. The implementation is procedural, and all using Ruby does is greatly limit the performance of the program--so I implemented it in C++. I use Python for Bioinformatics research because of the excellence of Numpy.",1246467436

682938,comment,682842,682897,0,0,jerf,,,"Look at it from different, different perspective: economics. News supply, even what you call ""quality"" news supply, has skyrocketed during the past few years. Recall that supply is not just the abstract amount produced, either, which may not have changed much, but the supply available to the customer. That's where the skyrocketing has occurred.<p>This has had the perfectly predictable effect on price (dropped it like a rock), with further perfectly predictable effects (eventually the supply is going to consolidate and contract some) coming in as second-order effects. The only question is timeframe.<p>""I love the internet as it is, but I honestly believe it's not going to last.""<p>So, for that reason, it pretty much can't. Which isn't to say there won't be some ""free-to-the-consumer"" news, but there can't be so much of it.<p>That said, your distinction between ""bloggers"" and ""quality"" is already out of date. Ultimately, that's a form of ad hominem. Just as it logically doesn't matter where an argument came from, it doesn't matter whether a good bit of reporting comes from a ""blogger"" or a ""quality"" news outlet. Maybe one blog post in 10,000 is a ""quality"" journalism story, but that's still a lot of real journalism getting done.<p>(Just to be clear, since the presumption is usually that a post is an argument or disagreement, I'm not disagreeing or arguing, I'm further explaining.

Why'd he write it to her then? (Edit: he commented on this; see below.)<p>Simone Weil was brilliant. She had remarkable mathematical gifts, though she decided early on that she wasn't good at math by comparing herself to her brother. (André was not only a mathematical genius, he was 3 years older. Talk about an unfortunate data point.) She ended up, in her brief life, doing remarkable philosophical, political, and spiritual work. Her intellect was as deep and as original as they come. At the time this letter was written, she would have been at the height of her powers (working for the French resistance in London, as I recall, writing a book about how to rebuild France after the war - a book which de Gaulle supposedly threw in the garbage without reading).<p>Simone and André Weil used to act scenes from Greek tragedy <i>in Greek</i> when she was 4 and he was 7.

If I knew what will work out, or for that matter ANY of the people here, we would be doing it. We can spend hours and hours talking about the idea, telling you the problems why it wouldn't work, but still be way off course of the reality. Recently I spoke with my ex boss who has been in IT for so long, now retired and he said, quoted ""If someone asked me back then if Facebook would have worked out, I'd say no chance.""<p>I think, we entrepreneurs shape the world around us to tune into new ideas. Persistence and continuous mutation/evolution showed to work for life, why not business too?\nWhenever someone asks a question here on HN, you get 90% of critiques and ways of discouraging. I say screw them. The spirit of real hackers and entrepreneurs is to just do it, be perseverant and have no fear of failing, but if it is to happen, fail fast and learn from it for the next iteration. No other can influence the success or failure than the entrepreneur himself, so I think you should hear the tone of only those that give you suggestions which way to go. I am sure you know what the problems are.<p>My suggestion. Build a prototype, use something that you can build it very quickly e.g. Rails and then hear out what the people are saying about it. Then modify it day by day from what you hear, and I guarantee you that you will eventually end up with something great. Your idea might be brilliant or stupid, but it is not on us to judge. Also, when you get discouraged, remember it is not on you either to judge.<p>I personally believe that is indeed needed and a great thing and has been going through my mind by reading a bunch of stuff.

682872,comment,682607,682751,0,0,mdasen,,,"Part of the issue is that there is no such thing as ""simple"" replication unless one means ""unreliable"" replication.  Simple replication is just shooting off the same SQL insert/update query on two servers.  In the best scenario, that means that if you use a time function, you're likely to get two different results.  In the worst case, it fails on one server and data gets out of sync.<p>Really, it's not that PostgreSQL needs more replication or built-in replication.  It needs <i>better</i> replication than any of the current solutions.  pgpool, while great as a connection pooler, is a terrible replication solution.  Slony-I is based off triggers and its communication costs grow in quadratically (O(n^2) - yuck!).  Plus, Slony-I requires an immense amount of setup for every table and every key.  Mammoth replicator, which seems to be the closest to the right track, has a website that doesn't show much life and only a beta release for download.  Plus, it still looks like there's a good amount of setup.<p>What we all really want is for PostgreSQL to implement a log-shipping based replication system where we can say ""replicate this database"" or ""replicate these tables"" to another server and have it just work.

This excludes the ineffable creativity which drawings are so good for.

Since you're interested in criticism, and I think it's the little touches that make people think a game is 5/5 instead of 4/5:<p>- I second the tiny screen complaint. The small enemy fighters might as well be pixels. A full screen option, if technically possible, would dramatically improve playability.<p>- I don't ""feel"" the movement system. I'd prefer really big thruster effect when I accellerate and turn. You have this but it's tiny. I want to feel Newton's Third Law. This game is way way behind Star Control II as far as the fun factor of simply moving the ship around.<p>- Combat doesn't feel strategic at all, but just like a spazzy click-fest. I have no idea how you'd solve that, but look at how much more fun the combat is, again, in Star Control 2.<p>- The store system, where an option to buy the weapon doesn't show up until you buy the previous one in the ladder, feels gamey and artificial, and turns me off a bit.<p>- Going into the Flex interface in the starbase instantly, with the music and sound suddenly stopping, is jarring and feels very amateurish. Something like a docking animation, with the buy/sell interface consistent with the look and feel of the rest of the game, would go a long way towards making this game seem professional.<p>- Nexus warps on the minimap look way too much like planets, they should really stand out.<p>- The pop-up mission objectives, again to me, make this feel like an amateur game from the 90s. I'm not sure how that could be made better but other games (say the level objectives from Starcraft or Warcraft) don't feel this way. Having some voice would of course be best but I understand the size constraints. Still some Flash games do this very well, notably Sonny and Sonny 2, and Robokill.<p>- Sorry, but the player ship is kind of ugly.<p>PS: I'm very much in your target market.

If you were super bright in high school, you will probably still be super bright in your 20s and 30s.

We're taking a different approach to the 2 most popular paradigms: collaborative filtering on your userbase (e.g. Last.fm) or expert hand labeling (e.g. Pandora). <p>Instead we consider any implicit or explicit relationship between two artists expressed on the web as a data point for our recommendation engine to analyse. This could for example be that Arcade Fire and LCD Soundsystem were mentioned in the same review. We also incorporate data from our users' listening histories. You can see the recommendations at work on artist pages and on our Band Manager. <p>Our goal is to generate recommendations that harness the wisdom of the biggest crowd possible: all music lovers anywhere on the web.

Started programming at 8, started CS in college when I was 13. Flunked out because I was bored at 15.
Always been interested in artificial intelligence, but a year and a half ago I read a book on the way the human brain works and suddenly I had a vision of something programmers missed in all of the machine learning algorithms they built, which is a basic part of the human cognitive process, and I suddenly understood how to add it to existing algorithms.<p>Anything else?",1194981595

And they have algorithms for getting multiple guys to move around in formation. Sometimes there is some type of system with goals (get 1000 wood, get an 80 food army, kill X base, etc) and then it picks things to achieve those goals (build more wood harvesters, build more units, attack). sometimes they use ""learning"" algorithms where they tweak parameters by running the AI repeatedly and seeing which does better, and they can use games with a human player to do that too (if it wins too badly, have it aim less precisely).

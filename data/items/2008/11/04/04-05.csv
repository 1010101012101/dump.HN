That is something that should be decided by her religious beliefs or where she chooses to live and raise her family.  I meat so many female vegetarians that don't want to kill a cow to eat it, that I can not imagine a woman aborting a baby because its FUN.<p>Women typically have a reason, and if we want to stop abortions there are so many pieces to the puzzle that making abortions illegal will not stop them.<p>If the reasons are economic, then we need to give single mothers more help.<p>If the reason is emotional in the case of rape and inceast, we need to be understanding to let them choose.<p>If the reason is medical, and life threatening, the moral lines are gray at best anyways.<p>If it was done as the result of a carefree sexual behavior, stopping abortions are not going to stop pre-martial sex.  Heck I bet many of us on this forum are 1st borns and very well might be the result of a opps between two unmarried lovers.<p>It really pains me that we can become so easily divided on a topic that is so personal and so hard to be black and white on.<p>I really wish there were more political options than YES or NO.",1225774786

353004,comment,352565,352787,0,0,endtwist,,,"The problem isn't that the project lost sight of its original goals. It sounds more like the goal of this project wasn't clear between groups.<p>Stallman stated that ""the plans aimed for low cost, enabling many children to use the machines, and free software, so they would have freedom while using them."" From what I understood, the goal of the project was to get computers into the hands of children in third-world countries, so they could simply get experience with computers -- period. It was my belief that the fact that free software was used was simply out of convenience; since free software was also free (as in beer), it was another step in cutting the costs of the laptop.<p>When Microsoft stepped in and ""offered up"" its OS at the extremely cut costs, Negroponte decided that would be a more useful option; I don't think his intention is to force-feed proprietary software to children. Either he believes Windows is a better option, or he is an economically self-serving individual. Regardless, I sense that the ultimate purpose of this project was unclear to certain people.<p>On a less direct note, I can't stand Stallman's zealotry. It's great that he is able to stand so firm on one particular point, but it is also a terrible trait, considering that he isn't willing to even give a moments consideration to alternative options on a scope/level _outside_ his ""cause.""",1225774122

I did find the interface a bit convoluted though, as the options presented in the menu may be a bit complex and overwhelming for a typical newspaper/magazine editor trying to add and place content on the site.<p>I'd advise sticking closely with KISS for your target audience.

353001,comment,352540,352943,0,0,jfornear,,,"What value does your single vote add?<p>In regards to this argument, a single vote has no value because the outcome of a single mandate election of this scale is never determined by 1 single vote. The outcome would remain the same with or without your vote. That is the point.<p>You bring up issues and demographics. Same rule applies. The attention given to your demographic is never affected by 1 single vote unless it is the single vote that causes the politician to focus attention or turn his/her back.

However...<p>Your use of the phrase ""imposing on others"" is telling. It implies you are separate from the others who vote, but in a democracy, during voting, you are not. You are all part of one system, and you all work towards the democratic task.<p>When you choose not to vote, you exclude yourself from that system. One single absence will indeed not damage the system significantly enough to destroy it. But, as I said, this system replies on human behavior, and more specifically socialization.<p>When you post articles on the New York Times website, when you post here and when you chat to friends about the futility of voting and when you tell them you have not voted you affect them; you influence them.<p>Human behavior is incredible herd-like. Your choice not to vote affects others, others affect others, and that affects, in this case detrimentally, the democratic system.<p>And this, again, goes back to the fallacy of composition. It was rational for you not to vote. Yet, because you live in society, that decision affects others, and when it affects enough people that newly formed decision becomes highly irrational.",1225773730

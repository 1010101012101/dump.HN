3549462,comment,3548445,3549088,29,0,rickmb,,,"How do you think this is ever going to change if programmers, some of the most sought after professionals in this economy, keep taking orders from these people?<p>For a team with mature, responsible and professional developers, it shouldn't be such a big deal to have a non-technical manager anyway. Most management responsibilities have nothing to do with technical matters. A manager should serve the developers, not order them around. A good manager, technical background or not, will be glad to get out of the way of a good team.<p>I myself am a manager with a technical background. I consider myself no more than mediocre as a manager. There are a lot of non-technical managers out there who could probably do a way better job <i>managing</i> , but they would have to be told by the programmers what they need from them.<p>But most programmers don't speak up. Most programmers don't say no. Most programmers don't explain why interruptions are so costly, let alone outright <i>refuse</i> to let that ruin their work. Most programmers have never read pg's essay about maker time and manager time.<p>A professional chef will walk out if his boss told him to burn every steak to a crisp, but most programmers will grumble a bit, get on with it and then (but only if they <i>really</i> care) bitch about it online. This despite the fact that chefs have way more to lose given the job market.<p>With most programmers being so unprofessional, assigning a grade school teacher doesn't even sound like such a far fetched idea...<p>It's not exclusively a senior management problem. Senior management doesn't know there is a problem unless they happen to have a technical background themselves, which is an unrealistic expectation, given that software is everywhere these days.<p>It is first and foremost <i>our</i> problem. We're the ones that know what is wrong and how to fix it. We are the professionals this business relies on.<p>Only assigning managers with a technical background isn't going to work anyway, because there are not enough of them to go round.<p>As a programmer, you have to be a bit of masochist to put the peter principle to the test on yourself while your technical knowledge is still relevant, and people are willing to pay you good money just to code.",1328309749

That is to say they have demonstrated that not only are they unable to behave responsibly after using alcohol, but also that they are unable or unwilling to anticipate and plan for this inability before using.<p>Instead there should exist the concept of a ""drinking license"" that can be revoked if an inability to act responsibly with respect to alcohol is demonstrated. (We already have regulations and penalties to keep alcohol out of the hands of certain classes of people in the US, but currently we use an age threshold instead of a more sensible set of criteria -- it's far from airtight but is a decent balance of effectiveness versus intrusiveness).<p>""Acting responsibly"" could include anything from ""not committing a crime under the influence"" to ""not endangering one's health"" to ""not becoming dependent on welfare"".<p>In principle this could be extended to other recreational drugs, beginning with cannabis and possibly extending to harder drugs.<p>(This is all basically stolen/borrowed from here: <a href=""http://www.samefacts.com/2011/06/drug-policy/a-serious-drug-legalization-talk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samefacts.com/2011/06/drug-policy/a-serious-drug-...</a>)<p>Unfortunately some degree of damage to society will happen before it can be demonstrated before a judge that a person is acting irresponsibly, and even what's broadly agreed upon as ""responsible use"" of recreational drugs would cause some damage to the physical and mental health of some individuals.

Need to change a class name that gets referenced hundreds of places throughout a project? Project-wide search and replace! Can't figure out what the string of 4 integer parameters to a function are? Just hover over it with a mouse and the IDE will tell you! Some IDEs even go so far as to create code for you using templates. And then there's always interactive debugging.<p>But, all this wonder comes with a price. For me, the key reasons I prefer vim to any ide out there is:<p>1) speed. compared to vim + bash, every ide is slow.
2) code portability. I work with lots of different languages on a daily basis and having to switch from Eclipse (java) to Monodevelop (C#) to whatever the http/css/php du jour is these days.
3) IDE maintenance. No matter what you use, ides have a ton of setup overhead just for the specifics of the project you're working on, let alone if you want to customize the environment.
4) fragility. Vim + bash rarely breaks or leaves me unable to work on a project. I have been left high and dry by IDEs multiple times. All it takes is a coworker checking in personal changes to a team-wide project file. Then you're left in a broken state, figuring out what went wrong.<p>so, there are some pros and cons. Everybody's style is different and there are real advantages to both approaches.",1328308415

3549394,comment,3548824,3548824,39,0,jrockway,,,"Yes, it's well known that big companies with big continuously integrated codebases don't manage the entire codebase with Git.  It's slow, and splitting repositories means you can't have company-wide atomic commits.  It's convenient to have a bunch of separate projects that share no state or code, but also wasteful.<p>So often, the tool used to manage the central repository, which needs to cleanly handle a large codebase, is different from the tool developers use for day-to-day work, which only needs to handle a small subset.  At Google, everything is in Perforce, but since I personally need only four or five projects from Perforce for my work, I mirror that to git and interact with git on a day-to-day basis.  This model seems to scale fairly well; Google has a big codebase with a lot of reuse, but all my git operations execute instantaneously.<p>Many projects can ""shard"" their code across repositories, but this is usually an unhappy compromise.<p>People always use the Linux kernel as an example of a big project, but even as open source projects go, it's pretty tiny.  Compare the entire CPAN to Linux, for example.  It's nice that I can update CPAN modules one at a time, but it would be nicer if I could fix a bug in my module and all modules that depend on it in one commit.  But I can't, because CPAN is sharded across many different developers and repositories.  This makes working on one module fast but working on a subset of modules impossible.<p>So really, Facebook is not being ridiculous here.  Many companies have the same problem and decide not to handle it at all.  Facebook realizes they want great developer tools <i>and</i> continuous integration across all their projects.  And Git just doesn't work for that.",1328308365

States are just arbitrary things made by ... historical reasons, I dunno why.  This reason is the same reason the customs guards use to excuse their crappy behaviour to other people.  No-one deserves to be treated like that.<p>Does President Obama get that sort of treatment when <i>he</i> goes through the U.S. / Canadian border?<p>> Don't like the system? Don't like how a particular country enforces its laws or what the punishment can be?<p>>Don't travel.<p>I would have said, ""Complain.""  Because the more people in a position of power act like that, and people don't complain, the more it gets accepted as normal.<p>I find that often you get pestered by people in museums, saying, ""Don't point!"" and whatnot.  The last time we went, my daughter got told off for <i>touching the plastic sign next to a painting.</i>  It didn't used to be like that, the museums have got more ... well, fascist.   Some of them now have airport-like security with X-ray machines (e.g. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).But people put up with that crap, and they've got used to it.  50 years ago, people would have thought, ""What the fuck?!""<p>In the 70s (I think) Jean Tinguely made machine-like sculptures that <i>people were allowed to touch and use.</i>  Now those sculptures are worth millions, so they don't even turn them on.  But even new works by unknown artists nowadays, they would never let you touch the art works.<p>It's interesting to compare it to a restaurant.  Because in a restaurant you <i>pay afterwards.</i>  So if the waiter starts being dickish, and you complain, and ... he carries on, nothing changes, well you can just stand up and go! And not pay!  But the fact is that the restaurant wants their money first.  So usually they are much nicer than customs guards or museum attendants.<p>(I live in Europe, but) why don't you U.S. / Canadian people do the following:<p>Give a tip to the guard when you next pass through customs, but only if they are reasonable, do their job properly, and they aren't rude.  You like tipping anyway!  Make it a new American institution, get all your friends to do it.<p>Eventually, the customs guards will learn to expect their tip, and will be nice to you.",1328308266

(Did you really acquire locks in an order that guarantees you will never deadlock?  Is your date formatting library threadsafe?)  Finally, there is threads and STM, but STM adds overhead and retrying transactions wastes resources.<p>None of those solutions are very good, and node is in the same place: it is another not very good solution to concurrency.  Right now, nobody in the world can come up with anything better.  To do concurrency right, you have to be very careful, and those caveats apply to all the other concurrency mechanisms.  node's event model is basically equivalent to the other mechanisms; fatal if done wrong.  Doing one thing in one place makes the process model work.  Not having any state shared between application operations makes threads work.  Event-driven systems are a compromise between the two: you can share state between logical threads of execution, but the order in which state updates occur is deterministic.<p>Every model has its strengths and weaknesses, and node has strengths and weaknesses.",1328307466

Because it's not in any academic's pure self-interest, acting alone, to stop publishing in for-profit journals.<p>It is the ""tragedy of the commons"". Take overfished waters, for example. It would be beneficial for all the fishermen if they only took half as many fish, but it would not be beneficial for any individual fishermen to do so.<p>Thus, someone has to take the lead (thank you Tim Gowers!)",1328306631

3549271,comment,3547598,3549152,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Let's take an example from history. You have a country like Britain during WWII. It is a democracy, it has elected a government which has chosen to make war against Germany. There is widespread public support for the government and for the choice of making war against Germany. More so, the civilian economy is in high gear supporting the war effort (supplying food, clothing, arms, ammunition, vehicles, etc.)<p>I can understand being apprehensive about violence against non-combatants, but in the above situation what exactly is the justification for excluding attacking civilians?",1328306582

3549255,comment,3545548,3546690,1,0,becasse,,,"I'm British, and I've lived between Holland, Italy and France for a few years.  I don't think it's really true that the British are more racist or narcissistic.  I think they are more fake, and more arrogant.  I think the racism is really a reflection of the British <i>newspapers</i> than the people.<p>A thing that British people forget is that our country is the <i>only</i> in Europe where there are no ID cards (yet).  In Italy, Holland and France people think it's <i>strange</i> when I tell them that it's not only that you don't have to <i>carry</i> an ID with you in Britain, but that it's not even compulsory to <i>own</i> an ID (passports, driving licenses, etc. are all optional).  Furthermore, you are not required to register your address in Britain, like you are in, for example, Austria, Italy, and Holland.  In Britain, the state <i>doesn't know for sure how many people there are, and where they all live</i> because there is no national database.  They have the voting register, NHS database, DVLA database, whatever the Inland Revenue has, and the census, but it's a mess and they don't really care.<p>In comparison, when I moved from Holland to France recently, we had to <i>de-register</i> (in Holland), and we took great care to say that we were travelling (not true) and we gave no address.  We didn't even give the country.  But they found out anyway, because they sent us letters and stuff, even though we didn't have to register in France.  The Dutch state is extremely efficient, data is shared widely and easily between state organizations.  It's vaguely fascist.  The British system, in comparison, is chaotic.<p>In my opinion, the British don't appreciate how liberal their state is.",1328306403

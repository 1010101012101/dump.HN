7106584,comment,7087237,7095646,1,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"In a projector system you generate light, and then you block it using either photographic film or LCD to produce the image. A lightfield display can be thought of as a 2D, higher resolution generalisation of a lenticular (&quot;no glasses&quot;) display, or for example, the display of the 3DS.<p>In these kinds of displays, you have a light generator (LED or flouro or reflection) with the same surface area as a normal print or display. But to produce the directional light, for say the left eye, you must block the portions of the image that relate to the right eye from the light travelling to the left eye.  And vice versa. This halves the amount of light for 2 directional images. thirds it if you want 3. So you end up with an image that is much darker then normal. you must compensate by generating 2 or 3 times the amount of light.\n This problem gets worse the more &quot;views&quot; you add on. So if you want 10 omni directional views you have to generate enough light for all of them, since, even if you set everything to &quot;white&quot;, as you suggest, most of that white is getting blocked from your view.<p>Or to put another way, you get allocated a smaller source 2d image plane surface area to generate your viewpoint.",1390441661

First of all airlines file their fare rules and OTAs don&#x27;t change the prices, and generally airlines pay around $10 to us to book a RT fare so there is little room to discount. Kayak is a meta which means all they do is present prices they are given from their partners (either via a feed or scrape) and then send them to the partner who shares the fee. Southwest (as others have mentioned) is not available in the US as a business choice. Kayak also heavily caches the fares (everyone does to make performance better) and inventory changes a lot especially in close by dates. Seeing cached prices of a cached price means the actual price can change a lot from searching to booking. Note the final price is <i></i>only<i></i> determined when you hit a booking page, everything before that is cached and might be fairly stale. Of course they can be errors in pricing since the fare rules are crazy complicated and often the difference in fares might be all the taxing entities. Each country, county, city, airport and cow pasture might affect the final price so it&#x27;s possible that a country where you are booking might affect this (our customers are mostly in the US) but I doubt it.<p>tldr - lucky &quot;hacker&quot;",1390440729

It is incredibly important, if you want to get the job, that you simultaneously deny being primarily motivated by money, power, and status, while sending the social signal that you are in fact primarily motivated by money, power and status.  If you weren&#x27;t, you&#x27;re probably making a mistake applying for a job at an investment bank (although I believe the joke about someone writing on their resume/cv/cover letter about their &quot;lifelong passion for taxation/equities/super funds&quot; did the rounds a few years ago).<p>So you get your extra-curriculars/interests/academic quals to do the dance about how well a rounded person you are, but simultaneously you must wear the right clothes, drop the right names, read the right things, follow the right topics, and say the right words to strongly signal that your main motivators are in fact money, power and status and that you accept that.  And if, god forbid, you&#x27;re ever asked the question outright, you must find a way to explicitly deny it, while sending the subtle message that is completely the opposite.<p>Similarly, what are colleges selling/interviewing for?  Well it sure as hell isn&#x27;t skills or merit, because most rich people didn&#x27;t use skills or merit they got from university to get rich, and many of them could be gotten at a similar standard for a far cheaper price.<p>God no.<p>Connections.  Power.  Links.  And the hunger for doing what is required for more of it.<p>And that&#x27;s what &quot;leadership&quot; signals.  That you care about it.  That you want it.  That you&#x27;ll be surrounded by others who think and want the same.<p>That&#x27;s what elite universities are selling.<p>As for the rest, well, that&#x27;s probably just regular human imitation/cargo-cult mentality.

7106456,comment,7104056,7104418,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"My understanding is that there are three competing theories which have the strongest claim on explaining Type Ia supernovae. The classic theory is that a non-white dwarf companion star feeds material onto a white dwarf, which increases its mass. This kicks off a complicated chain of events, some of which may occur over timescales of a thousand years, ultimately culminating in the initiation of fusion reactions (initially Carbon, then Oxygen) in the core of the white dwarf. The fusion reactions release heat, but because the white dwarf is already under electron degeneracy conditions it is unable to increase pressure and expand to moderate the fusion reactions, so instead they are caught in a very strong positive feedback loop. In a matter of seconds the fusion reactions consume all of the Carbon in the star and then begin consuming the Oxygen in the inner core, this process releases more than enough energy to completely unbind the star gravitationally, the star explodes in a supernova. Alternately, it&#x27;s also possible that a white dwarf star could have more than enough mass to undergo a Type Ia explosion but is kept in check by rapid spinning. As the star ages and the spinning slows down it crosses a boundary where the above events occur. Or, two white dwarfs could instead merge with each other.<p>It&#x27;s actually likely, in my opinion, that all three models contribute to Type Ia events in nature, but it&#x27;s currently unknown which variety is the most common cause of such supernovae.",1390439426

7106449,comment,7104251,7104251,5,0,beloch,,,"VR is undeniably going to take immersiveness a step forward, but user agency is still the true king of addiction.<p>Real life is obviously the benchmark for immsersiveness, but we don&#x27;t consider it possible to be addicted to living in the real world. We might consider some to be &quot;adrenaline junkies&quot; for pursuing dangerous aspects of real life, but we say they are addicted to a certain chemical the body produces rather than life.<p>Books are one of the least immersive forms of entertainment widely consumed in that the interface is through abstract symbols.  Still, they allow us to experience things that we are unlikely to encounter in our own lives.  They engage our imagination and are indeed addictive.  A good book lets you almost live another life.<p>Theater and film are, in most ways, more immersive than books.  Instead of forcing us to construct everything in our own minds, much of what we experience is constructed externally, just as in real life. An actor&#x27;s performance may be completely different from how we might imagine a character to be, just from reading his or her lines, and this really fools our minds into thinking characters are more real.  However, as in books, we are almost always passive observers. We have no agency.<p>Video games are now capable of offering everything that film does, but while granting the audience agency.  We can perform tasks, affect the outcome of the story, etc.. As with film, technical limitations mean that suspension of disbelief is necessary for us to buy into a video game world, but when a game does make us buy-in it can be a place we&#x27;ll live in for many hours before exhausting the content.  It can be grueling to sit through a 180 minute film, but a 180 minute game would be considered far too brief. We also respond very differently to challenge when we have agency.  Many films that challenge the viewer too much are considered &quot;confusing&quot;, and rapidly tire audiences.  A game that doesn&#x27;t offer challenge is unlikely to be fun at all!  Many of us enjoy conquering games where challenge crosses the line into frustration!<p>Many video games made today are modeled after books and film. You play a truly exceptional protagonist who is easily capable of things beyond anyone else in the universe. The game-world pivots and changes around this character, even if the user doesn&#x27;t have a lot of control over it. These are highly entertaining, but probably the least immersive.  Other games take a much more realistic approach, most notably MMO&#x27;s.  Users, by technical necessity, cannot change the world radically because other players share the world. Users become just one more player in the crowd.  MMO characters have little power in the simulated universe, but users have complete agency over their own characters. The unpredictable nature of interacting with real humans, the necessarily insurmountable challenges of the game (in terms of time required to &quot;beat&quot; the game, if nothing else), and total user agency make MMO&#x27;s the most addictive form of video game known.<p>If you&#x27;re with me this far, kudos for being patient!  VR is a means to interact with both pre-recorded films (think google-street-view cam on a snow-boarder) and video games that has been largely neglected to date due to technical barriers. Oculus and Valve are clearly on the verge of shattering those barriers. We&#x27;re probably going to see media running the gamut from pre-recorded VR videos offering no user agency (other than turning your head) to MMO&#x27;s where humans can interact with each other in simulated environments with complete agency. The level of addiction posed by these different recordings and games is going to vary wildly, just as the addictiveness of current games and media varies.  VR is an exciting step forward for immersiveness, but we shouldn&#x27;t expect anything VR to be an addiction problem!",1390439377

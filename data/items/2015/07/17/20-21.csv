For example, a Cleaner cannot tell Homejoy that while she may have picked different zip codes or cities as part of her territory, she only wants to stay within one zip code, or within one small part of a zip code, each day. Instead, if a Cleaner chooses Oakland and San Francisco as part of her territory, Homejoy alone determines whether the cleaner will stay in Oakland on a given day, stay in San Francisco on a given day, or travel in between the two cities multiple times on a given day. Furthermore, Cleaners cannot tell Homejoy whether they want a little or a lot of down time between each job, or each job start time or end time. Cleaners cannot tell Homejoy how much driving they prefer to do, whether the jobs need to be near public transportation, whether the Cleaners prefer to be stuck in rush hour traffic or instead on routes that are reverse commutes, how many jobs the Cleaners want to perform each day, or whether or not they want to return to a previous customer.&quot;<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/startup-workers-sue-to-be-recognized-as-employees-not-mere-contractors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/startup-workers-s...</a>",1437166783

But I don&#x27;t see how this observation is relevant to the question I posed: why we should think that this hurdle, but not the many others that exist today, would stop people from selling melatonin, as nostromo suggested it would. (As opposed to merely making it marginally more difficult which, of course, is undeniable.)</i><p>I guess I just don&#x27;t see how this question isn&#x27;t a tautology. No one is arguing that the other hurdles couldn&#x27;t stop it either. But if the manufacturing costs are $1 million, and the FDA costs are $1 million, then I don&#x27;t see how it isn&#x27;t obvious that needing BOTH is $2 million and thus MUCH more difficult. I agree that if we could magically reduce manufacturing costs to zero it would be even better. But your argument literally seems to be &quot;since this is already expensive and difficult, we can make it arbitrarily more expensive and difficult with no reduction in success rate&quot;. Which obviously isn&#x27;t true. More to the point: we <i>know</i> that it can get through the manufacturing hurdles because <i>it did</i>. We thus know this company is capable of 1x costs. Had they ALSO had additional costs from the FDA then it would have been >1x costs and thus we <i>don&#x27;t know</i> if they would have succeeded.<p>Perhaps an analogy. Let&#x27;s say someone proposed a new fee for graduating college of $50,000. I would say &quot;well, that might make it so less people can graduate, since it&#x27;ll cost more&quot;. Then you might respond &quot;But what makes you think THIS cost will prevent them, and not the existing expensive tuition?&quot;. Well, both do, but they already pay one and we&#x27;re in control of a theoretical second one.<p><i>> Or, perhaps more to the point, why this particular hurdle is not worth the supposed consumer protection benefits of FDA regulation?</i><p>This on the other hand is a completely reasonable question, but <i>not</i> more to the point, just a a <i>compeletely</i> different point than &quot;the company already has costs, what is the problem with more costs?&quot;",1437166641

Some ideas on how you might do that:\n1) allow cleaners to set their own prices / times / availability at short notice\n2) have users give reviews -> encourages quality\n3) provide the bonding / insurance as an optional service to the contractor, not the customer, but make clear on the listings who is and is not bonded / insured.\n4) only have reviews from current customers be easily available (or maybe bad reviews live for ever, good reviews only show if from current customers ??), so there is an incentive to stay on the platform, as it represents your marketing channel\n5) take a fixed, smaller percentage<p>It seems like there is a problem in the market when you have an overwhelming supply of people willing to clean, but low actual demand due to high price:value ratio. You can interpret the difference in price between the cheapest &#x27;craigslist&#x27; cleaner and the professional cleaning service as the &#x27;price of ignorance&#x27; regarding the honesty and quality of the cleaner. It seems that Homejoy was trying to control quality, and then claim that price premium for themselves (as does every other professional cleaning company), while pretending that their cleaners were contractors, not employees.<p>I think they might have been more successful if they tried to build tools that actually reduced that price premium, by making it easier for people to judge the quality of cleaners, in turn making it easier for the better cleaners to charge more, and driving the bad cleaners out of the market. You would expect the average quality/price to go up due to competition and better information, which would raise volumes, and you would still end up making money, just a smaller percentage of a much bigger market.<p>I recall the story about how Ms Cheung spent some period of time working as a cleaner, to learn about the cleaning business.

I&#x27;ve made it into a lead developer role after starting as entry level in 2010.<p>What I found after graduating and from trying to hire people, is that computer science degrees do not equip programmers for the industry.<p>CS seems to be better designed for people who want to stay in academia. My experience in school was only with languages like Java, C or C++. I had to take a lot of math. I had to implement a lot of algorithms and design patterns. Aside from learning the basics of programming, the only thing that has gotten me to where I am is my ability to understand and problem solve, that&#x27;s it. Good programmers know how to learn and stay motivated, that&#x27;s it.<p>When I left school with a BS, I would have struggled just to get a web server running on localhost. Now, I write business applications. In my spare time, I&#x27;ve learned about 10 languages. I&#x27;ve launch 5 website (all failures, but that&#x27;s okay). Launched an Android app. Launch three games on the Play store. Tutored college kids on the side. Reviewed technical books for a publishing company.<p>The odd thing about all of this is that I&#x27;m going for my masters right now, BUT that&#x27;s only because my employer is paying for it. I don&#x27;t value the degree enough to pay for it myself.<p>In short, if you can get someone else to pay and all you have to put in is time then go for it. If not, take the tuition money and buy some books and video tutorials. It will be cheaper and require less time.

I enjoyed it enough to want to learn further,  with a &#x27;different&#x27; full time day job.<p>Now, I am working my way through cg-masters video tutorials (warning: these are $$ not free), but worth the money.

If you happen to not have seen a pedestrian in the crosswalk as you do this, that pedestrian is <i>dead</i>; they will not hear you, and you will be through them before you even know it.<p>The acceleration of the Tesla presents a challenge to normal human reaction times on a routine basis.  It encourages the driver to use the greater acceleration advantage to do things that would not be possible in more traditional cars, like zooming from a dead stop to a very high speed to get through turns or rapidly changing traffic blockages.

We have 20 years of experimental progress to extrapolate when we expect to hit these thresholds.<p>I agree that progress in the 20s and 70s was much faster. But they were grabbing onto low-hanging fruit. Building  even a &#x27;bad&#x27; quantum computer is several orders of magnitude more difficult task than building, say, a 486 processor. The degree of experimental control required is much much more. What I see looking back is steady progress towards greater experimental control in multiple systems and very frequent and steady achievements of milestones.<p>What you forget when you compare quantum computing with DNA sequencing or image recognitions is that quantum computing is at the bottom of current theoretical paradigm. When you do DNA sequencing the science of your instruments (eg. centrifuges) is not suspect. In QC everything is suspect; your system, your detection mechanisms, your control systems.

But articles like this, which twist the truth and drop so much context make my blood boil.<p>Some examples:<p>&quot;Many high-risk medical devices today are approved on the basis of just one clinical trial (as opposed to new medications, which usually require two trials)&quot;<p>This is <i>only</i> true if the medical device in question is an update to an existing medical device that has extensive clinical data and use in the field. Sometimes that minor update is as minor as a software modification.<p>&quot;And only a small minority of clinical studies of medical devices are randomized, controlled and blinded — the gold standard for reliable evidence&quot;<p>This is true because it&#x27;s unethical to conduct major surgery on someone to give them a placebo, so we can&#x27;t really blind the studies. They are definitely randomized and controlled though.<p>&quot;In fact, according to a 2014 journal article co-written by one of us, the F.D.A. has never issued a warning letter or penalty for a postmarket study delay.&quot;<p>This is laughably untrue. I&#x27;ve in fact worked for two companies that received penalties for not being timely in postmarket surveillance. It might be true that FDA has never given a warning letter (which is their version of &#x27;you&#x27;ve been a bad boy, no new products for you until you get your shit together) solely for postmarket reporting failures, but that&#x27;s a much different claim.<p>&quot;When a high-quality clinical trial was finally completed, in 2011, it found that patients who had the device implanted were more likely to have another stroke and to die than those just receiving medical management. Despite this evidence, the F.D.A. did not withdraw the device (though it did narrow its recommended uses).&quot;<p>Wingspan was left on the market because for certain classes of patients it was a good treatment. FDA&#x27;s action was appropriate.<p>&quot;But alarmingly, the 21st Century Cures Act would establish a third-party program of nongovernment authorities to assess whether a company is permitted to make such changes. The act would enable the device manufacturer itself to select — and pay — the third party from an approved list. This flagrant conflict of interest would make it impossible for physicians or patients to have trust in the safety or effectiveness of updated medical devices.&quot;<p>This is the mechanism that Europe uses to approve all medical devices, not just changes, and it is not the nightmare scenario the authors make it out to be. The reason is that the regulatory middlemen have balanced incentives: they can&#x27;t be too lax because when they get audited by the European Commission they can lose their license (and in effect go out of business).

Wondering whether belief under particular circumstances is &quot;really&quot; knowledge is as meaningless as wondering whether a glider is really an aeroplane - or whether an amusing quote is really a joke. When you get down to empirical predictions (and empirical predictions inside the world of Minecraft are no less empirical) - Will someone predict correctly? Will this object fly? Will my friend laugh at this quote? - the confusion goes away.<p>> People without humanities education have humanities knowledge comparable to grade-school math. It&#x27;s more than nothing, sure, but it&#x27;s far from making one knowledgeable.<p>I deliberately didn&#x27;t say anything about knowledge, because the article doesn&#x27;t; the article talks about beauty, about wonder, about things that touch the innermost parts of our mind. If that&#x27;s its defense of the humanities, then it&#x27;s on those criteria that I will judge a humanities education - and my experience is that humanities graduates are no better at producing those things than those who are not.<p>> In any case, they are mostly STEM people who have some historical beliefs that are completely erroneous<p>What is it that they&#x27;re erroneous about?

Do you think that human existence lies solely at that level?<p>I think that we think more clearly and make better decisions at that level.<p>> Here&#x27;s that word again: real. Is a joke not real? What makes physical reality any more real than simulated reality? Is euclidean geometry any more real than non-euclidean geometry simply because we find the former in objective physical reality? Is, say, Call of Duty any more real than Minecraft or Super Mario simply because it imitates physical reality better? They&#x27;re both simulations. Certainly some things are more physical than others, but whether that gives them any more value is completely subjective.<p>And yet, in ordinary, everyday life, no-one finds the word confusing. We know immediately which things are real and which things are not (and sure, we find that some things straddle the borderline - but that only means that language is imprecise, not that we don&#x27;t understand those things), and we find that there is consensus, that realness is objective.",1437163258

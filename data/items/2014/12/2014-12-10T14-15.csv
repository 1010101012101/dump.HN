8729455,comment,8728010,8728587,0,0,walden42,,,"Decentralization, and thus p2p, is the very reason services like these are being created, to protect against censorship. That seems the logical next step.<p>And besides the &quot;altcoin&quot; problem, MaidSafe does this. You pretty much provide a hash to the API, and it fetches your files using chunks from a decentralized system. It&#x27;s genius. All the hard work they&#x27;re doing is the &quot;magic work behind the scenes&quot; that implements that.<p>As for the altcoin, the word &quot;altcoin&quot; connotates a &quot;copy&quot; of bitcoin or something negative. It&#x27;s not fair to call SafeCoin an &quot;altcoin&quot;, since it has nothing whatsoever to do with any other coins. It&#x27;s completely original (and does not use a blockchain), and it deserves a chance to prove itself. But I understand all the bitcoin evangelists don&#x27;t even want to consider that another digital currency can make it to the top.",1418223586

8729453,comment,8729047,8729314,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> With these kinds of policies being more common in young companies, I highly doubt that paying back unused vacation can have any significant effect on normal operations.<p>It has an effect on the balance sheet, since vacation time accrued but not used is a liability; in companies whose operations are labor-heavy, and that have high-pay workers, that&#x27;s may be a concern, especially when seeking investors, since concrete current liabilities can weigh heavily against hoped-for future returns.",1418223563
8729452,comment,8729047,8729047,0,0,jcadam,,,"I like this idea of minimum vacation.  Most companies I&#x27;ve worked in use vacation days as some sort of reward for sticking with the company for X number of years (i.e., &quot;When you hit your 5 year anniversary, you get an extra 1.5 days of paid vacation.  Won&#x27;t that be nice!&quot;).  And when I say paid vacation, I really mean PTO with no separate &#x27;sick leave&#x27; days.  Which means people show up to work sick.<p>Funny enough, the company I work for was recently bought, and in the interests of making things &#x27;uniform&#x27;, we were forced to adopt the purchasing company&#x27;s vacation policy, which meant an across the board cut in everyone&#x27;s PTO hours (to include folks that negotiated additional vacation days when they were hired -- those agreements were declared null and void).  Apparently the execs thought the hit to morale/retention was worth the &#x27;cost savings&#x27;.<p>On the other hand, I once interviewed at a company with an &#x27;open&#x27; vacation policy and was immediately suspicious of it.  My first thought was &quot;I&#x27;m guessing people don&#x27;t take much vacation?&quot;  That didn&#x27;t go over so well with the interviewer.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see an employer that treats vacation as a means to increase employee productivity and retention (burnout prevention, etc.), rather than as a pure cost to be minimized as much as possible.",1418223553

8729394,comment,8728745,8729258,0,0,jpradeek,,,"For me, I was always annoyed with how tedious it was to edit things. i.e, The gap between what I think vs what I have to do in the editor to get it done. This constant annoyance was what drove me to spend time and energy into learning it. I believe that if you don&#x27;t care about it, you won&#x27;t really benefit out of it. Because the whole point of switching to Vim/Emacs is to minimise the gap between what you think and how you do it.<p>Let me give you an example. You&#x27;ll be thinking, &quot;I need to change all the arguments to a function.&quot; In other editors,  you&#x27;ll press the arrow keys until you get to one end, press backspace key multiple times until you get to the other end. In Vim, I&#x27;d do &quot;ci(&quot; which means &quot;change everything inside (&quot; - which is pretty much how I think about what I need to do. A similar but more common example is changing text inside quotes. Again, that&#x27;d be &#x27;ci&quot;&#x27;.<p>Not everyone feels the annoyance about this and if you don&#x27;tt,  hats totally fine. Learning something just because its cool is never worth it. Learn it if you really care about it.<p>Also read this post by Yehuda Katz about how he started for some ideas. <a href=""http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convi...</a>",1418223093

However, there are things that I (and I believe the population at large) value that cannot be optimized using simple market dynamics with no regulation. For example, I expect there to be taxis on the road, even if the demand is very low. Another is, as I mentioned previously and you agree, insurance. Yet another is cooperation - it is beneficial for a city to mandate that there is only one app/protocol for hailing taxis, whereas for private companies it makes sense to each create its own walled garden and prevent new competition from entering.<p>Of course, all of the above could be created by carefully-constructed regulation (or appropriate economic incentives), but simply limiting the supply of taxis along with a small number of rules is the easiest way to do it. Ideally, we&#x27;ll get better regulation; while Uber will probably make us reach that goal faster, I hope the end result is not like Uber.<p>I&#x27;m divided on surge pricing, but I definitely see no reason for surge pricing on &quot;predictable&quot; events, such as Friday night. Even for &quot;unpredictable&quot; events, such as rain or even a hockey game, I think it would be better if people would be able to hail taxis on the street, or on a first-come-first-serve basis. On the other hand, I realize that surge pricing can increase supply, but the very existence of surge pricing can also lead to market manipulation - suppliers waiting until surge pricing is in effect, so that they get a higher fare. In effect, (if I understand correctly) since surge pricing is not momentary (when it starts, it doesn&#x27;t end until sometime later), Uber is creating a free market distortion itself.",1418222959

Some search and replace, and some reorganization.<p>I had been plodding away, copying, pasting, and repetitively hitting the arrow keys and typing a few characters in each place for about 5 minutes when a friend came over and saw what I was doing.  He was an absolute *nix expert.  After a few moments, he told me that he could finish all those changes in just a minute.  I had seen him code in Vim before, and was impressed, but it seemed like magic at the time.  I saved the file and went over to his desk and asked him to walk me through exactly what he was going to do.  He loaded the file up in Vim and started with a quick regex that knocked out 80% of the work.  He then recorded a macro that yanked the current counter number into a buffer, searched for the next edit position, pasted in the counter number, incremented it, then shifted position to the next code block and updated that reference as well.  He then asked me about how many sections there were. I said about a hundred, so he typed 99@q and poof!  There were a few more, so he did a :g/<some keyword>/p to see how many lines there were and then did that many more macro invocations and the file was done.<p>I was hooked at that point.

You&#x27;d like to debug this without needing to find a repro with the debugger active. But the JIT&#x27;s compiled code doesn&#x27;t expose enough information for Firefox&#x27;s debugger to work with.<p>How is your statement relevant? To enable the debugger to work on code that is currently in a busy loop in JITted code, it needs to introspect stack frames, and modify code (one way or another, for breakpoints). The current JIT design doesn&#x27;t permit this. How do you propose doing these things in a less complicated way? Either you deoptimize the existing frames (which the JIT apparently already has support for, and is described in the article) or you annotate generated code with extra debug info (which AFAIK it doesn&#x27;t have support for).<p>I also don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;pepper the code that enters the JIT&quot; in the context of stack traces.

It would be harsh of Uber to suspend/terminate a driver from one complaint, and what kind of check could they have done to detect that he would attack passengers in this way in the future?<p>In any case, I think it&#x27;s important to consider how this would play out in a pre-Uber world. If someone took a taxi ride and got attacked by the driver prior to Uber, there was very little evidence pointing to that driver. Passengers would need to remember their identification details or number plate after an event that tends to leave people quite mentally shaken. Not a good outcome; I think there&#x27;s a good chance they would still be searching for the driver if this hadn&#x27;t been facilitated by Uber.",1418221696

Similarly, if you had to play Street Fighter 3: Third Strike Chun-Li with Super Art 1 while levelling up your summoner to unlock Super Art 2, you would be playing a gimpy fake version of the character.<p>Why do we expect that playing a fake version of the hero against other fake heroes is better training for playing the real game than just playing the real game? What if the player picks up habits that are only good when the opponent cannot use the correct runes, spells, and masteries? In our Street Fighter example, people could learn to do things that Chun could punish with SA2 but not with SA1, and they would get away with them until their summoners reached the max level.<p>What if the player is an experienced LoL player who moved to a different continent, or a genre savvy player, or a LoL player whose previous account was banned?

This strikes me as an attitude that drives people away from Vim. Maybe it depends on individual differences in learning style, but I would say the exact opposite. Embrace the arrow keys! And all else that is familiar.<p>The moment you start with Vim you&#x27;re diving in the deep end and productivity will take a plunge. At least training wheels like the arrow keys can help you stay productive and keep using it for long enough until you cross over the productivity threshold (where you&#x27;re more productive than on a normal editor, even though you still have a lot more learning to do).",1418220460

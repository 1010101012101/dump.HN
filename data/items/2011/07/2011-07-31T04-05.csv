2827634,comment,2827228,2827521,10,0,atdt,,,"I basically agree: the article loses a lot of credibility making Heroic Age / Iron Age comparisons, and I think you & others are right to call them out. But I do think there are things that are uniquely worrying about the present moment. IBM has a lot of skeletons in its closet, but for many years one of its biggest clients (perhaps the biggest -- does anyone know?) was the US government, which made IBM at least minimally responsive to public needs. IBM was paid very handsomly by government clients to keep the US in the lead in science and technology, and that meant that a lot of people at IBM had the necessary leisure and latitude to think about some serious problems, some of whom went on to win the Turing prize and invent things like relational databases.<p>I don't think these people were smarter or more virtuous than us. (The comparison is specious on many levels, but bear with me.) I simply think that things were set up in such a way that it was possible for them to follow their natural creative and intellectual impulses and in so doing gain a measure of social respectability and pride that we all basically crave.<p>I think the startup world is different. The shoestring budget and (even more critically) the highly compressed timeframe in which startups operate create powerful incentives to take up easy problems that could be monetized quickly. I'm struck by how much of the advice that is offered to young people here amounts to something like, ""stop thinking so god damn much and build a business."" That seems so toxic! It creates an atmosphere of scorn toward big ideas and impatience with moral and intellectual reflection, with lasting consequences on the life-choices people make. I suspect a lot of young men and women internalize this ideology and develop a real sense of shame about being thoughtful or conscientious.<p>I'm not suggesting we all apply for a job at Big Blue. There are a great many wonderful things about the present moment, chief among them the enormously expanded access to creative computational tools and its concomitant, the wonderful increase in the geographical/cultural spread of creative work with technology. But there are also some very worrying trends, and I think we ought to confront them.",1312086991

She talks about renting out her place through Craigslist on multiple occasions (without any problems).  This is extremely risky and I wonder if her place was vandalized through craigslist, would people be calling for them to pay for her house?<p>When the ""Craiglist killer"" was in the news, I would be curious to see if the responses here on HN were similar (that Craigslist is to blame for the murders).<p>If I hired a developer from HN and they ended up stealing my source code/IP, should I blame Paul Graham?<p>Emotions play a lot into it.  Her entire post plays into our emotions and gets people to feel sorry for her.  Politicians and marketers use this same technique, and I don't like it.<p>At the very end, she does admit that it is her fault.  But not without a few passive-aggressive jabs about the assumption that because she had paid a service fee that somehow Airbnb had pre-screened the applicant.  I'm not sure why anyone would make this assumption.<p>I think because the criminals are not here, and people need someone to blame, airbnb is the next best thing (having the deepest pockets in the situation helps too).<p>Everyone just needs to take a step back, look at the situation, and take out emotions for a second...they often cloud judgement.",1312086881

2827600,comment,2826297,2827581,2,0,codeslush,,,"Too many AirBnb stories, and too many comments - so it's possible my input is duplicated.  But I COMPLETELY agree with you.<p>A month or two ago, someone was visiting SoCal (San Diego) and needed some help - I was about to offer him a place to stay at my house, for free.  But I had to think about things a little.  It's unfortunate.  I wanted to be kind, and help someone out.  The problem:  I have a large family - comprise d of boys and girls - teenagers at that.  Would my charitable acts backfire on me?  Not sure.  Maybe, maybe not.  Ultimately, I didn't make the offer.  It wasn't a SAFE decision for me or my family.  It would have been irresponsible, even though it would have been a nice gesture.<p>I would NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER offer up my primary residence to a complete stranger - NEVER!  I didn't do it when I would be ""present"" and I definitely wouldn't do it when I was an absentee.  No way.  It's IRRESPONSIBLE.  A secondary residence?  Maybe!  Of course!  Maybe they vomit on my couch, or piss on the carpet.  No problem - that's, sadly, somewhat expected of ""renters"" --- but to provide a complete stranger to your primary residence, with all your private material, documents, property and what not in place, is just NAIVE!  I'm sickened by what I have read, and I think AirBnb has no ""social"" or ""business"" obligation in this matter.  In fact, I'm wondering where my mental wiring has gone wrong to have such a strong feeling.  WHY on EARTH is everyone siding with this person?  Because of her gender?  Because she's a good writer?  No?  No... they've handled the whole thing, publicly, wrong.  This is a great lesson for them - but they are NOT AT FAULT - not in my opinion!  But, that's just my opinion, and clearly not that of the masses.",1312085498

Furthermore, Paul has been pretty vocal about what does/doesn't work in the hotel industry.  I'm pretty sure his hotel ties don't give a rat's backside about his article, TC, and the issues AirBnB are facing.<p>The conspiracy theory angle is pretty dumb, in my opinion.  Might there be people trying to take advantage of the situation?  Sure.  We've seen at least one article here on YC about an AirBnB competitor plugging the need for customer/host verification.  I don't think the hotel industry really cares at this point.<p>VRBO and other rental sites as well as CL are the near term losers for AirBnB.  Two million arrangements in 2+ years is a drop in the bucket for the hotel industry world wide.  Furthermore, the majority of the traveling populace don't use such services.",1312085479

However, all the context points to a lot of risk without much reward.<p>To answer your specific question: you have a lifestyle business.  At $100k, you are in the friends and family range, not angel range.  F&F can fund a lifestyle business.  Angels won't fund a lifestyle business.<p>To give you some critical feedback...<p>$100k will not give you a 2 year runway.  That's a 10-14 month runway.  I don't care if you live with mom and dad, eat top ramen for every meal and don't shower to save on your electric bill...you can't make $100k last 2 years.  And if there is ANY chance of a lawsuit, forget it.<p>You described your competition as 'a solidly established market leader'.  Have you ever built a business that took market share from the single incumbent?  If not, you have no chance in hell of success.  If you have done it before, then you <i>might</i> have a chance.  Of course they are a 'horrendous' company with a crappy UX, crappy customer service, etc.  However, you're assumption that 'offering better service' is enough to take market share is simply unrealistic.<p>If it takes you 2+ years to get to ramen-profitability, this is absolutely a waste of your time.  The risk-versus-reward is simply absurd.<p>There are SO MANY opportunities for a hacker out there, that you really shouldn't waste your time on this opportunity.  I realize this is the best idea you have right now, but don't bite on it.<p>Keep looking for a better opportunity.  You really don't have to look that hard to find a much more reasonable (i.e. lower risk, higher chance of success and bigger upside) than this.",1312085348

It would be if everybody clearly agreed on what should be, but people clearly don't.<p>For what it's worth I actually agree with your premise: I would like the police's capabilities limited as well. However, part of being rational is questioning weak arguments regardless of whether they support your point or not.<p>Just taking your conclusion as an axiom with no support is not particularly conducive to reasoned discourse. (This is why arguing religion with the truly devout is rather difficult--God is axiomatic to them.)<p>Logic is the best tool we have--save perhaps for the scientific method--to make decisions. It's worth maintaining regardless of the issue in question.<p>So yes--there always need to be shades of gray. Reasonable people reasonably disagree on almost every issue, because basically no nontrivial issue that isn't contrived is entirely obvious.<p>Perhaps you are fundamentally correct and your arguments stronger--I certainly think so. But this does not mean the issue should not be discussed. I've been wrong before!<p>Anyhow, I've gone well off-topic now, and I'm typing this on a cell phone.

It might boost morale if it is shown to people who would be interested in the technical merit.<p>I've noticed that on the business side, people have sometimes made their career through whining and complaining.  They will never be satisfied because not saying anything or being satisfied looks bad.  The game is that they complain, and you respond.  If you respond then that person has displayed control over you and your team and the person's status is enhanced.  Going skunkworks is going to cause problems if these people know about it because they want a venue so they can play the game.<p>If you are going ""dark"" , you need to get them to forget about your team's major focus.

Laws are for people, not currency. 
Property and contract laws still apply even with different currencies. The fact that the surrounding infrastructure is still being built can be frowned upon, but this has nothing to do with laws.<p>And yes, it is like real money. In fact it's even more like real money then what most people use daily. Bitcoin properties are almost the same as precious metals, making it much more money-like than a fiat currency. (On which we build our bank accounts and, as yet another layer, various credit tools. At the end of the day, you start to be quite far away from ""real money"".) Now, if such a thing is desirable is another question entirely. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is money.",1338014905

4026703,comment,4026486,4026486,3,0,tferris,,,"I'd start with a website. Important is that you give yourself small tasks, just learning from books and doing exercises is boring and you learn often too much which isn't relevant. I wouldn't do mobile development either: the learning curve is too steep and you face a fragmented landscape.<p>An example path:<p>1. Build a plain web page without anything (and learn HTML, CSS)<p>2. Build more: a web site with multiple pages and little dynamics (and learn a backend language/system like Python or Node.js with Javascript)<p>3. Build a blog with more dynamic content (and learn a web framework like Django for Python or Express for Node.js and how to use them with a database like MongoDB or MySQL)<p>I would start with plain HTML, CSS and later learn Javscript, then a little Node.js and then Express and MongoDB as database => that's the quickest way how to get things quickly done and to learn <i>why and how</i> things work. And you have basically to just learn three languages: HTML, CSS, JS and if you like some simple dialects (like Stylus instead of CSS and Jade instead of HTML). Or if you have some basic dev skills already just jump into Node and Express, you will have very soon first results.<p>I wouldn't start with something too much 'magic' involved. Magic = abstraction that you do not understand anymore. Ruby on Rails is an example: you learn tons of conventions, see magic everywhere but won't have a clue for a very long time why and how things work and thus, you just learn conventions and won't learn really to code. Ruby on Rails can be very frustrating: you do Rails for three months and are still not quick or productive and then you think it's your fault or you can't code (but it's Rails with its magic, conventions and increased complexity where actual coding is a very small part). Don't get me wrong: setting up a site with Rails can be done in few minutes but customizing it without knowing how Rails works (and even if you know how Rails work) can be a real pain. With Rails you learn how to effectively glue things together, Rails ecosystems provides thousands of great and mature gems waiting to be glued together.",1338014358

You feel that the quality of your work is suffering. You work hard, and yet the only time off you are able to obtain are vacation days.This seems grossly unfair. The majority of people are not eager to use a fake doctors excuse simply because they can, or out of a desire to see if they can get away with it. Most often, it is the only way people can take some time off work to rest or solve a problem.Need a note? Weve searched the  These are the best you will find ANYWHERE on the net.

I realize it is to make the subject provocative and thereby capture readers, but it will also produce such a negative visceral reaction that the key take-aways will be missed:<p>1. The best leaders are capable of adding value to other people's jobs. You don't necessarily need to be able to do their job, but you need to be able to stand next to them.<p>2. There are times you need to step in and demand more detail to find out what is really going on.<p>3. Good leaders have the [skill|experience|6th sense] to know when they need to do that versus trusting their employees. Sometimes it may be never, sometimes it may be always.<p>4. Good leaders can do the above without losing themselves in the minutia of trying to do other peoples' jobs for them (or telling them what to do).<p>Perhaps ""If you don't know the details, you can't effectively lead"" would be better.",1338012554

It's like some guy opening a bank in an old garage with thin plaster walls, simple pin tumbler locks on the doors and regular metal closet as storage for money. One has to be really careless to put one's savings into such bank, and only reason I can imagine why people did that because it was not apparent to them.<p>Building secure publicly accessible website that can store bitcoins is very hard. Almost all common software has multiple vulnerabilities, and the fact that stealing bitcoins once system is compromised is trivial, and, as I understand, irreversible (unlike breaking into bank website, for example, but like breaking into bank vault with cash) - this makes such task super-hard. I would be very suspicious about any professional that is not properly intimidated by such task.

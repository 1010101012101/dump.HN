1570829,comment,1570085,1570618,0,0,Vivtek,,,"Very true, except for the statement that other countries' involvement stopped worse from happening - the Yugoslav arms industry was nonexistent, and while they most definitely would have kept on killing one another with rocks, I think they would have been less efficient.<p>I agree with your larger point, though. The breakup of Yugoslavia was unfortunate - and inevitable - but it's kind of the exception that proves the rule.  1914, after all, was the <i>last</i> time a war was started in Yugoslavia, and it took down the rest of Europe and spread beyond the continent.  This time, it was relatively self-contained, and the pieces of Yugoslavia are joining the Union, one by one.  (After all, Yugoslavia was always a political fiction - Tito needed a platform big enough to fend off the Soviet Union, and by God if Slovenia didn't like it they could go suck an egg.)<p>Belgium may be next - and nobody's going to get killed over it.

Sounds like I was at least on the right track.<p><i>But if you ask me, the real solution is to have the kernel team fix their epoll implementation performance issues instead of forcing people to work around it with hybrid approaches.</i><p>That does indeed sound like a better conclusion.<p><i>Other than the stupid single-syscall-per-fd requirement, there's nothing in epoll's interface that would force it to perform worse than poll when the active/total ratio is high.</i><p>I don't see a reason why the syscall-per-fd couldn't easily be replaced/augmented with a single mass add/remove syscall which takes an array. The worse performance seems similarly baffling; it almost sounds as if they had some kind of inefficient data structure holding the file descriptor pool; considering poll() uses a flat array and epoll uses set operations I assume it's pretty tricky to make it perform well, even with a hash table. Maybe set operations aren't the best way to handle this data structure; but only some profiling in the kernel code can tell us that.<p>Obviously it'll take until 2.6.37 at least for any changes to enter the mainstream kernel, and until then a hybrid approach sounds sensible for those unwilling to patch.

1570781,comment,1569559,1570571,0,0,bl4k,,,"* That point about performance was more about FreeBSD being first with a lot of performance and security improvements. As I said, this argument was a lot easier 5-10 years ago but doesn't apply as much anymore.<p>* The Mono vs Micro kernel debate between Linux and BSD doesn't apply as much anymore since they both support both. With Linux is varies a lot between distro vendors. Vendor kernels also tend to lag behind the main branch (at least this is my experience, mainly with Debian and Fedora). I find that FreeBSD, as a distro, allows easier kernel optimization especially since the default kernel is tight. Again, this is something that on the Linux side of the argument is the responsibility of the vendors, who approach the issue by providing targeted server and desktop distributions (most do). You are right though that there is very little performance diff between Micro v Mono (see the classic debate from when Linux was announced: <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/appa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/appa.html</a>). I have always preferred only having code on the server that is required by the system (code coverage), and the FreeBSD way of doing this is managed better than any of the Linux distros, IMO.<p>* As somebody mentioned below, the Linux kernel is very much tied to GCC and its toolchain. It is so tied to it that the Intel compiler uses the Linux kernel as a test for its GCC compatibility mode.<p>* A BSD port of SELinux is actually part of TrustedBSD, which has in-turn been ported to FreeBSD. There are a bunch of other things that TrustedBSD entails, I can't name them off the top of my head atm, but both SELinux and TrustedBSD line up with orange book<p>* You are correct that the stable/release cycle of Linux is more up to each distribution, but since there is a step between kernel and distro (which FreeBSD as a total operating system doesn't have) there is a lag there, and a risk of support ceasing (or patches/updates/support suddenly becoming a commercial service, as it did at Red Hat)<p>In the end it depends on how you define 'better'. It is tiresome to enter debates about benchmarks and features, it is what you are most comfortable with. If you want to hack at a UNIX operating system that is very neat and cool, FreeBSD is a very good choice. If you like knowing what every file and every command does on your system, and prefer a UNIX-like uniformity in how things are done, then FreeBSD is again a good choice.<p>I would thoroughly recommend all hackers try out FreeBSD and become familiar with it. It will alert you to why some things are done the way they are, and there is a very deep history in that operating system, so at times it feels like opening a time capsule.<p>Add to that, if you need an OS for commercial purposes, FreeBSD is free as in 'do whatever you want', which can also be an advantage.",1280835067

That bastard GNU tar(1) man page was created because Debian has a policy that everything must have a manpage.<p>I like Unix, but the GNU Info format solved some real issues with man. It has built-in index and cross-reference metadata, scales to the size of entire books (the FreeBSD manual would be a single info page), and is much easier to write. I much prefer reading info pages to man pages for that reason.<p>A lot of people seem to dislike GNU info because they confuse the GNU TexInfo / info format with the info(1) program. I'm not a big fan of the default reader (I use the Emacs one instead). But the TexInfo format can be exported to multiple formats and read by multiple programs.

Their performance seems as good as any other VPS host I've used (Xen or otherwise), I think the price is pretty good, and I haven't had any downtime to speak of so far.

Apple have something like 91% market share in desktops and laptops priced above $1000, while Microsoft dominate cheaper priced machines (how many Apple computers can you buy below $1000?). A person who is a Mac user is unlikely to voluntarily switch back to Windows, they tend to keep buying Macs despite the price tag (product differentiation justifies the price in their mind). How many people spend over $1000 on a new PC? Gamers and people who need/want advanced hardware, but they are in the minority of PC users.<p>Obviously, this is in relation to the historical relationship between Apple and Microsoft, now Apple is mainly a consumer devices company in terms of revenue, and Microsoft will go toe-to-toe will Apple in the tablets and smartphones markets soon. Will be interesting to see how the relationship fares as this happens.",1280833747

Nor does it prevent vulnerabilities being introduced through installed userland software or other applications.<p>One benefit would be that with patches and ports, you can patch any vulnerability in a service without being forced to upgrade to a new version that might have incompatibilities with your system or that might introduce performance degradation.<p>You see this all the time with PHP, sysadmins run binary upgrades on the packages because of a security vulnerability, only for the website to spit out a bunch of warnings about functions that have been deprecated in the new version.",1280833605

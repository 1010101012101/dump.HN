Then again he's an investor in Sympoz :)<p>The interesting thing is the interactivity piece.  When talking about something as general as a startup idea it's difficult to engage in a general way.  Sympoz attempts to solve this with questions indexed to the video playhead.  This is interesting and its very cool that Brad has engaged in some of these discussions.  I think I'd much prefer to watch these and have someone lead discussion or answer questions in person though.",1367290789

So this dual structure was set up to make sure that taxes were paid on anything that looked like profit from operations, just in case.<p>Note that in all cases there are no individuals who are getting paid the profits as there would be in a privately held company, nor are there shareholders involved apart from the Foundation.<p>All of which is to say that the term ""for-profit"" doesn't necessarily mean the entity's sole purpose is to maximize profit, or indeed to make one at all; it's simply a classification for tax law purposes...<p>As always, I am not a corporate tax lawyer (nor any kind of lawyer), and this is not legal advice.  ;)",1367290221

That's kind of my point.<p>I'm also curious how well Dommy would perform in the 'real world'; seeing as everything is compiled down to plain JS, then the divide between library and implementation is removed. jQuery is a larger download hit on the first visit, but if it's already in cache (perhaps before they even reach your site) then the only code required to be downloaded is your app's specific implementation.<p>In the Dommy example for the templates, the jQuery code is 10 lines -- when formatted like generated.js (the equivalent Dommy code) and removing 2 unnecessary variable declarations. By contrast, generated.js is around 60 lines (giving you a few on account that there's some empty else-statements...). I know minification can do wonders, but the jQuery implementation is clearly going to be much fewer bytes. At what point does it eclipse the size of the jQuery lib itself? I guess that's up to usage.<p>If your library <i>is</i> the implementation, then it'd seem like you'd have a lot more data being sent over the wire, and likely more often as well on account of any changes to the Dommy which alters the output will have an effect on the cached files for each of them where that functionality was used. On the other hand, updating jQuery means only the 1 file has to be re-downloaded -- and not every userland implementation which uses the API.",1367288210

For all we know richer people are conditioned to say they are content because of the social stigma of being a depressed-rich individual.<p>I always thought that the trick to getting to the truth of the matter was to ask a question that couldn't have a negative consequence. The more neutral a question feels the more likely you are going to get an honest answer. ""Are you happy"" isn't as good as ""What's the funniest movie you saw this year"".<p>The ladder question, as I read it, says more about where you think others would see you. It isn't a question I'd answer honestly. I'd think about my wife, kids, house, and all my privileges before even thinking ""am I actually happy"".<p>When I used to work for a company that did personality inventory testing the neutral sounding questions (True|False I enjoy dressing up to work) were always the ones that carried weight, and the over-the-top questions (True|False I've thrown a punch at my boss) were just a coarse filter.",1367287976

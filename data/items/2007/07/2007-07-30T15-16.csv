37684,comment,37620,37622,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"A big difference between the .com bubble of the late 90's and the situation right now is in the number of companies applying for an IPO. That number is still currently a fraction of .com bubble levels. <p>VC investments are on the rise but still lower than at the peak of the bubble.<p>When looking at these statistics it doesn't yet resemble what we saw in the late 90's. Maybe people learned their lesson. Or it could be just the resulting chilling effect from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act... Its a lot more difficult to go public nowadays.

The larger factor is traffic in large metropolitan areas.  Driving an hour each way is far more detrimental than an extra 5$.<p>Biofuels have their place.  They are not the magical pill that will wean America of middle eastern oil but they surely have their respectable percentage over time.",1185809187
37682,comment,37336,37598,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The behavior of ants is certainly amazing. But take a look at behavior based robotics to see how well it scales. You won't find something as capable as, say, a cat. At least not by human design. The system needed to evolve such behaviors through EA would need to be quite complicated. We've seen systems that can do a pretty good job on mobility -- like that flopping starfish from Cornell. But locomotion is exactly the type of problem that has a very precise, quantitative objective function.<p>But perhaps I was too broad. I should have said orderable, which is really all that matters. You have to know something is better than something else. But you can't just take a euclidean distance in high dimensional objectives. Things just don't work like that. A real-world example: work-life balance. The two parts are just not really comparable, making optimization difficult. That's what I'm talking about.<p>Also, EA has lots of potential for lots of areas, but you have to compare it to other methods of solving a problem to talk about quality of the approach. Machine Learning offers a host of methods. Here is a great list of them

They've discovered over at AA that they can accomplish more with a support group in place than they can working individually. Their struggle with addiction seems a lot more manageable knowing that they're not alone in their struggle.  So where's the support group for those of us who support our families? Where are the Mom and Dad support groups? And what should these support groups even look like?

Rokhayakebe is suggesting to fix this problem via social networking.  <p>I think the alternatives are the intact networks that people use to find new jobs (alumni, friends, professionals, head hunters).  How will it compete with Facebook?  <p>Right now on Facebook, I can search by employer of interest (e.g. Google, McKinsey, etc) and it will pop up the closest contacts by some sort of FoaF distance algorithm.  I can friend them and message them to open up a dialogue.  ",1185808381

A system that is too insecure would not work.  But the virus threat needs to be real to discourage piracy.<p>Ultimately, users do care about an OS with lots of software available.  Many users will put up with some security threats to get that.",1185808125

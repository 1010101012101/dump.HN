The Hart & Risley study the article is addressing looked at the possible influence of genes, and found that the maximum influence they could have over verbal ability was maybe 20-30%.

1420985,comment,1420087,1420087,0,0,grellas,,,"A few observations on this:<p>1. There is no way a mere ""clerical error"" caused the company to send cease-and-desist letters of this type.<p>2. Trademark law is unambiguous on the point that prior use of a mark in commerce <i>always</i> trumps (within the geographical area of such use) subsequent registration of that mark by one whose actual use was later in time. In other words, the prior use of ""footlong"" by the hot dog vendor for 40 years leaves that vendor with clearly superior rights to the use of that mark vis-a-vis Subway. The vendor's priority would be limited to the geographical area in which such use occurred and would not extend beyond that - this is why Amazon, for example, had to settle up with a local bookstore in Minneapolis named ""Amazon"" for having infringed its (i.e., the local bookstore's) superior trademark rights to use that name and mark in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.<p>3. A putative trademark that likely is ""purely descriptive"" (such as ""footlong"") is not an enforceable mark and is not registrable on the primary register unless and until it acquires what is known as ""secondary meaning"" (such a mark acquires secondary meaning when the public primarily associates that mark with a particular producer notwithstanding its descriptive character).<p>4. Subway might have a shot at showing that its ""footlong"" mark has acquired secondary meaning given that it has spent mega-marketing dollars on it over a sustained period. The media fiasco resulting from this flap is not going to help its cause, however, as all guns will now be trained on it by anyone who has a vested interest in the issue.<p>5. By backing off on the hot dog issue, Subway is tacitly admitting that it has no hope whatever of showing that people will ever associate the mark ""footlong"" primarily with Subway when it comes to hot dogs. This part of what they are doing is smart. By limiting its claim to sandwiches only, Subway at least has some chance of getting its mark.<p>6. By the way, there is no problem with Subway (in theory) sending out C&D letters before its mark is registered. Just as the hot dog vendor did from its 40 years of use, so too Subway immediately acquires common-law rights to its mark based on its actual use in commerce. Assuming that the mark has already acquired the required secondary meaning from the actual use to date, it is an enforceable mark upon which Subway might choose to sue.<p>7. The broader point here, as noted by others, is that a company should not blindly follow formalistic advice from its attorneys without first considering how its actions will be perceived. By that measure, this was a pretty bonehead move on Subway's part.",1276192770

1420981,comment,1420731,1420731,0,0,rauljara,,,"My understanding of why the stock market is supposed to be good for society is that it encourages investors to invest in companies that need more capital.  It has the nice side effect of allowing people to buy high value assets that are likely to increase in value over time, letting people save for their retirements, while simultaneously providing capital to companies that may need it.  I fail to understand how a computer that holds on to stocks for < 20 minutes forwards either of those goals.  Maybe someone can explain why this is a good thing to me, but this really seems like a perversion of what free markets are supposed to be good for.  And again, maybe someone can explain why this would be a bad idea, but I'd really like to see a system where if you buy a stock you are not allowed to sell it for a fixed period of time that would be measured in months, and not seconds.",1276192658

1420857,comment,1418817,1418817,0,0,WiseWeasel,,,"Given the pains Apple has taken to ease the porting effort for developers, this claim is not just a little bit exaggerated. Let's compare the significant sources of platform fragmentation from an app developer's perspective; we've got 1) input interface and capabilities, 2) output capabilities, 3) OS capabilities, and 4) performance capabilities.<p>1) The fragmentation of input capabilities for the iPhone is manifested by a regular addition of input sensors to the iPhone. The actual physical text and interaction input on the iPhone has stayed unchanged since the first generation, with the same virtual keyboard, home button and touchscreen size and shape. Since the original iPhone shipped with an accelerometer, the 3G added a GPS receiver, the 3GS added a magnetometer and video camera, and the iPhone 4 adds a gyroscope and front-facing camera. The input capabilities of the iPhone platform are on a steady path forward, never losing any previous abilities. This makes it so a currently written app will always work as expected on a future device, as it will have at least the same set of input capabilities.<p>Android, on the other hand, has a vastly different situation. Some devices have hardware keyboards of varying design, some have only a virtual one. Various devices also have different shape, aspect ratio and size touchscreens. Accelerometers are present on all Android devices, but anything beyond that is a bit of a crap shoot, appearing in some models, disappearing in later ones. Flagship devices will typically mirror or exceed the input capabilities of the latest iPhone, for example, but other models will leave some out. There is no expectation that any given input capability beyond accelerometers will be present in future devices.<p>2) The output capabilities of the iPhone platform so far have gone from a 3.5"" display at 480x320 resolution to a 3.5"" display at 960x640, exactly pixel-doubled with the same physical size. This means that your app written with a resolution of 480x320 in mind will display perfectly without distortion on the new devices.<p>The Android platform, however, is host to a plethora of screen configurations of varying size, aspect ratio, resolution, etc., essentially making you redesign your interface for each different screen in the market.<p>3) The OS situation is vastly different on the iPhone and Android. iPhone OS updates are made available to the entire installed base at the same time for free, and the installed base of iPhone OS users is very quick to upgrade to the latest firmware, with ~90% running the latest major OS version, and most of the remaining ones only one version behind, with only a couple percentage points of stragglers. This means that you can count on your entire target audience being running at least the previous major firmware version. This makes the developer's job much easier by eliminating the need to test against older, often bug-ridden firmware versions.<p><a href=""http://metrics.admob.com/2009/12/updated-iphone-os-stats/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metrics.admob.com/2009/12/updated-iphone-os-stats/</a><p>On Android, we still have vendors shipping devices with the one-year-old Android 1.6 firmware, long after the major releases of 2.0, 2.1 and now 2.2. People who bought devices with older firmware often are not even offered updates to the latest version. Due to this, the portion of users running the latest firmware is a minority, and there are large populations stuck at various versions of the firmware. Since your target market is stuck running older versions of the firmware, you have no choice but to support ancient firmware revisions, with messy work-arounds for various bugs.<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-ve...</a><p>4) Performance capabilities are mostly a wash, the only difference being that the iPhone is on a steady path towards increasing capabilities, while Android has a more scattered path, with high and low-end devices with different performance capabilities on the market at any given time.<p>As a developer, it becomes obvious that the fragmentation taking place on the iPhone is not of the same order of magnitude as that taking place in the Android platform. This is to be expected when comparing a single-vendor platform to a commodity platform, but that doesn't make it any easier to deal with for those targeting the latter.",1276191128

I.e. something that helps the user's stated choice (and perhaps a bit of our best social judgment on mitigating the worst risks) become action.<p>In the earlier analogy, the bartender saw the troubling behavior.  Game design is not just analogous to how the drinks are mixed, but also the behavior of the bartender.  If one is programming the bartender-AI and one can, but doesn't, include the ability to be watchful in that way, and the reason one makes that omission is to increase drink sales... well, that seems pretty morally wrong to me.<p>You don't see how choosing to only include in a game's design the things that undermine user intentions of self-control and never any of the things that support those intentions, how that is a moral issue of game design?<p>Games can perhaps be used to help teach or reinforce the helpful skill of self-control and other better angels of our minds.  So possibilities of moral good are also clear.  Instead, are you saying moral metrics don't apply at all?  That there are no moral issues with how one designs games which treat their players little different from saps at a carnival?  No moral issues with making games that better and better undermine the player's will and take advantage of systematic mistakes in the way that player's discriminate, while having regard only for the metric of sales and no other effects.  Using someone else's weakness for gain is a moral issue.",1276190608

1420795,comment,1420415,1420415,0,0,lmkg,,,"I have a bit of a tin-foil-hat conspiracy theory as to why Google is copying Bing in several respects recently. From a game-theoretic perspective, it is to Google's advantage for the search industry to be as homogeneous as possible, because they're the incumbent.<p>As long as there's a difference between the major search engines, there's at least some sort of reason to go with one of the minor engines, for some fraction of people, some fraction of the time. If all the search engines are the same, Google wins because no one has a reason to switch and Google has the advantage of inertia. It is possible that it's better for Google to be identical to Bing rather than superior to Bing, especially depending on how situational or subjective that ""superior"" happens to be.<p>While I'm not a huge fan of Google, I don't think they would intentionally have a dick-ish strategy like that. However, I do think that their test-driven nature could push them in this direction anyways even if they don't intend to. Every time they try a feature and people don't like it, they can switch to Bing and Google gets the feedback... unless it's a clone of a Bing feature, in which case people can't really switch. So bad ideas that are clones of Bing features have a statistical advantage.<p>This is not to say that cloning Bing features is always a bad thing. I actually prefer Bing. I'm just saying that clones of Bing features have a statistical advantage during testing, regardless of how good they are in an absolute sense.<p>The solution, obviously, is Duck Duck Go. Or, more generally, if the search landscape is less of a duopoly, this phenomenon wouldn't exist as much.",1276190361

I can't judge, say, an economist or historian's work particularly well because I don't have enough background too. But if they've published a lot of peer reviewed articles, I can at least say that others who can understand their field get it.<p>(Note to those of you who are about to point out all the problems with peer review: I agree. But the solution to the problems might be worse than the problems.)<p>The second reason: if I'm writing an article or researching something, I don't have time to wade through tons of bullshit. I want to get at stuff that I can use. Peer review probably gets rid of some useful stuff and lets in plenty of crap, but it's a useful rough pass.<p>Who coordinates peer review and publishing and getting referees and all the rest of this scut work? Editors. They also get some of their journals' budgets from publishers. Publishers are now monsters that control hundreds or thousands of journals. They demand walled gardens and high payments. This situation is unfair and dumb, but it is, and until you have a way to replace the institutional authority and money of publishers, you get walled gardens.

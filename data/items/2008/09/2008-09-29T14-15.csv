Zones are the best game in town when you need OS level virtualization.<p>There are plenty of things that suck about Solaris -- zones aren't one of them.",1222700356

The typical barrier to entry for non-regulated industries, like cocaine manufacture and exporting in Central America, involves firebombing a new market entrant's facilities and executing their families.  Imperfect as it may be, I prefer the more heavily regulated version.",1222700299

There are a lot of people going nuts because their ability to do this is breaking down.<p>So, investment banks might fail, but as long as people don't pull money out of their checking or savings account I don't think the system is losing money.  What I expect is happening is a lot of ""fake"" wealth is being destroyed but I don't think it's a good idea to buy up fake wealth with cash the government is borrowing.  Because, as soon as we borrow money people will take money out of the system to buy our bonds which necessitates our buying assets to compensate.",1222698524

318360,comment,318008,318310,0,0,Retric,,,"I will preface this by saying my mother has a PHD in neuroscience and it's application to learning and talking to her we know a <i>lot</i> of the details but little of the complexity's in how the brain functions.  Anyway, several years ago I was riding on home from school and saw a bird out the window.  Out of boredom and curiosity I just started overlaying everything I know about birds and flight.  Everything from it's bone structure to the aerodynamics of flight feathers etc.  I blacked out and by the time I was aware again we 10 - 15 minutes had gone by.<p>I assumed it was probably a good idea to never do that again, but I have a incredibly detailed memory of what I pictured so there is a pull to try it again.  My point is I think you can overstress your mind and like overclocking a CPU it becomes less stable as you do so.  Our minds are a complex balance of chemical signals which has real limits.  I try to get enough sleep and take care of the wetware because I think it's less stable than you might assume.  Rest and good food are the basics, but so is balancing how you use your mind and trying to avoid unbalanced behavior.<p>I have gone all out 12 hour days for long periods, but they seem to lead directly to burnout and depression.  Yet, if I don't work really hard after a few months I start feeling useless and slow, so I don't think steady state is the best long term idea.  My guess is finding a good cycle where I avoid burn out and feeling useless for long periods but I have periods of extreme activity and rest is my best long term balance.  However, I have no idea how this relates to my inner biochemistry.",1222698048

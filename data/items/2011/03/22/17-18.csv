(Which is kind of a 'duh' if you think about it).<p>Parallelism is concerned with efficiency of the algorithm in a parallel environment. His example is that quick-sort is an easily parallelized algorithm (each level of recursion is two completely independent steps). This means that at each level, you can run the independent steps at the same time, meaning that in a parallel environment, you can see a big speed improvement.<p>Concurrency is more dealing with the control flow of a program. Concurrency tries to manage resources in a 'nondeterministic' environment.<p>Pretty much, its like an OS scheduler. The OS scheduler has to manage all of its resources, like the printer or the hard drive or whatever else, between different concurrently running processes, and prevent things like race conditions or deadlock.

As a platform, Java lacks the tools that a Unix sysadmin takes for granted.  For example, with Debian or Ubuntu:<p>What version of a library is installed, if any:  dpkg -l<p>What's the latest version available to be installed:  apt-get update, apt-cache search<p>Update the library for all applications that link it:  apt-get upgrade<p>These tools are important for administration, security, and troubleshooting.  It mystifies me that Java developers and sysadmins managing Java servers don't demand them.  Instead, they're willing to muck around in a web interface, go back to their dev box to look at Maven scripts, or go searching through the filesystem <i>just to see what software is installed and running</i>.  Even if you're not averse to doing that by hand, how scriptable is it?<p>If you have a large Java environment with many different services running on dozens or hundreds of boxes, how do you get a report of which boxes have a particular version of a library installed?  I know our sysadmins don't know how, and I know our Java developers don't care.  They could develop the tools themselves, but they have no interest.  The sysadmins do not do web pages; they are not going to spend all day going click-click-click to update a few dozen servers.  They have told the Java developers not to expect the same level of support for their applications as our C++ programmers get because Java is an unmanageable platform, and the developers <i>don't care</i>.

Clarifying,<p>1. Will netbooks (you mentioned the OQO) be built on modular, user-swappable hardware components.<p>2. Will smartphones be built on modular, user-swappable hardware components (you said, "" <i>802.11 if it is cheap and efficient enough, but provide a slot for drop-in 4g, bluetooth, DRM</i> "")<p>3. Will smartphones be build according to a fixed hardware/software HAL that is well specified enough that no OS or driver customization is needed and user-installable and substitutable OS's are possible.<p>#1 is possible IMHO. A few years ago ASUS was selling a customizable laptop platform that small computer stores could build and sell as their own brand. It was big and bulky and went away quickly, which is always going to be a problem with modular hardware, so I don't see this as ever being very popular. But someone might try it again with netbooks.<p>#2 is just never going to happen. Forget about it. if you <i>provide a slot for drop-in 4g, bluetooth, DRM</i>, someone else is going to build a competing smartphone with all of that built in but without the bulky connector and housing. It'll be smaller and sexier than your monster-smartphone, and it'll probably have better battery life with the extra internal room for a larger battery. Modularity is irrelevant when you can just include everything that's cutting-edge at the moment and you'll just get a new smartphone in a couple of years under a new contract anyways.<p>#3 might happen, but I still doubt it. It goes back to what I said about constraints and room for innovation. When something big needs to change with the PC HAL (like USB3), Intel, Microsoft, Dell, and a bunch of others have to get together and formulate something like XHCI to provide a common hardware interface - otherwise every USB3 chip would require a separate loadable driver. In the embedded market and with smartphones, there's no constraint on the hardware interface - you just throw the chip in and then add a kernel driver for it. Time saved, competitive advantage gained.<p>How much longer would it have taken for NFC to be included in smartphones if Samsung, HTC, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Nokia, and others had to get together and hash out a common hardware interface for NFC chips the way PC manufacturers do with stuff like UHCI/EHCI/AHCI/etc? A lot longer. And given that no one expects user-installable and substitutable OSs on smartphones, there's no incentive now or in the future to provide one. And given that a smartphone platform that provides a common HAL is going to be at a competitive disadvantage wrt smartphones with custom hardware, there's no thin end to this wedge.",1300813478

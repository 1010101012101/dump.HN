I have a Xamarin plan for use with Visual Studio for developing mobile apps in F#.<p>However I&#x27;m just keep running into stumbling blocks and general frustration developing in Windows, having switched from 10yrs of Linux purely for VS. With the general improvements in Mono and the open sourcing of F# I&#x27;d love to use them all together on Linux and take advantage of the greater OSS developer ecosystem there.<p>Monodevelop/Xamarin Studio is fine for development, more so with the newly-added split-view, and the F# support is pretty much on a par with VS these days, but without Xamarin.Android/iOS support I simply can&#x27;t move.<p>Maybe I should suck it up and buy a Mac instead.",1407232684

8136197,comment,8135967,8136143,1,0,f292,,,"Thanks for your comments - really useful.<p>Sorry you did not find it helpful for the sheet you tried it on. We have not yet implemented a way of showing 2D nodes in an intuitive manner and this is one of our focuses for the next release.<p>You mention context - I think this presents possibly one of the biggest barriers to adoption. We included the ability to jump back to the cell in Excel as a result of similar feedback. There is definitely a lot more that can be done though.<p>You also allude to where we think Slate can be really powerful - documentation. If we were to implement the ability to annotate and group together nodes in Slate, you can give a general overview of how the spreadsheet is working, with the option to dive deeper and investigate the nitty gritty, if needs be. All too often you are given someone else&#x27;s spreadsheet with no context, and this is where we think further value lies.<p>Would love to take this conversation to email to discuss further.

Sometimes the choice isn&#x27;t there.<p>I don&#x27;t actaully have chair suggestions - I think the actual choice is personal. I have a preference for more of a lounge chair for my computer desk because a good one has back and neck support as well as the room to adjust and sit comfortably, even if that means I&#x27;m in lotus position on my chair. Not only that, but it seems more likely that you&#x27;ll be able to test the chair first. I suppose that many people would miss the wheels, but if you can find one that swivels, the wheels don&#x27;t seem to matter as much. You might be able to install casters (didn&#x27;t see those in stock at Ikea, but  the hardware store had plenty).<p>I do have suggestions that might help you until you find &#x27;perfection&#x27;. Back in the states, I remember seeing lumbar support cushions. Something like this might just make your current chair bearable or at least buy time - and you can use that general shape to help guide your next chair. It is possible you can make one as well. You might try adjusting the height of your screen if your neck is hurting (even if this wasn&#x27;t an issue before).<p>Good luck on your chair search.",1407232315

8136143,comment,8135967,8135967,59,0,roel_v,,,"OK here is my feedback.<p>First some superficial stuff: Installshield is not going to fly with the market you want to make real money off, i.e. big organisations who want to deploy through Active Directory. The Office addin installer can be put as a merge module into an MSI, that will make the overall install experience much slicker. The instructions on the web page that opens after installation say to look in tab &#x27;Add ins&#x27;, but it&#x27;s in separate &#x27;Slate&#x27; tab (Office 2013/Win8.1). The introduction tutorial is unintelligibly small on a high dpi screen (Lenovo Yoga Pro 2); so is everything else that doesn&#x27;t scale with ctrl-mousewheel. I just aimed very well with the mouse to make it go away and I tried to figure it out on my own.<p>On to the functionality. I work with Excel models if not daily, then at least a few times a week. These are usually either models I get from partners and which I integrate with other models, or they are data analyses. Over the last few weeks I worked with an economic model and a demographic model I got from outside, and I did several analyses on land use/population data myself. They&#x27;re always intricate and on the overall complexity scale (as far as Excel models go) range from &#x27;medium&#x27; to &#x27;high&#x27;. So I think I&#x27;m exactly your target customer.<p>I tried first with a medium-complexity spreadsheet (5 worksheets, couple of dozen &#x27;variables&#x27; where the variables are usually 2d matrices and the analysis is in aggregating and disaggregating the input data in various ways). I tried Slate on several fields, but for none of them I could better understand what they were than by using Excel&#x27;s build-in &#x27;Trace precedents&#x27; or even by just reading the formulas. Slate shows only very little context; you have to scroll out far to see those 2 or 3 steps away, but at that point everything is too small to read. Furthermore, it doesn&#x27;t really dissect formulas; for example, an &#x27;if&#x27; with two VLOOKUPs is just a pink blob with a bunch of arrows coming in, without giving information on how or what. It also takes up half of the width of my screen, so there isn&#x27;t a whole lot more I can see on the screen.<p>What is worse is that there is no description of each &#x27;block&#x27; (could have taken the label in front or above the formulas in the original sheet); nor does there seem to be a way for me to enter them manually. For example, I can see the value in being able to annotate a &#x27;box&#x27; (variable) in my model with &#x27;Plot counts per district&#x27;, then an out arrow with &#x27;multiply with average amount of dwellings in low residential land uses for the transport zone&#x27;, then the box where the arrow ends up with &#x27;dwellings in low residential housing areas per district&#x27;. That doesn&#x27;t seem possible.<p>When &#x27;show detail&#x27; is on, some of the boxes have the upper left corner of some range of cells in them; I&#x27;m not sure how or why. They just seem to take up a lot of space.<p>It doesn&#x27;t look like I can edit anything in the result. For example, I have a lot of &#x27;if(iserror(formula), 0, formula)&#x27;. I don&#x27;t want to see all of that - I just want to see &#x27;formula&#x27;. The rest is an implementation detail.<p>When &#x27;hide detail&#x27; is on, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to jump back to the Excel sheet.<p>I had a more complex sheet I wanted to try it on after this one, but even this medium complexity one was harder to understand (and I wrote it over the last few days, so it&#x27;s still all in my mind) than the original Excel sheet is; so I didn&#x27;t bother with the more complex one.<p>Sorry to rain on your parade, it must have been a lot of work. I don&#x27;t see much added value though in its current form. I&#x27;m sure that with much polishing it can become useful. I think annotations should be first; then abstracting away implementation details of formulas, you have more ideas yourself probably. Slate also loses the spatial relation between e.g. columns next to each other; I&#x27;m not sure what to do about that, but it should make up for that somehow.<p>Lastly, the price is ridiculous at this stage. At first I though &#x27;oh 50$ seems OK, then I saw &#x27;/month/user&#x27;. $50 one-off seems OK; I don&#x27;t see who will pay 500 a year for this, especially with the basic functionality it has now.<p>Feel free to email me if you want to know more about the spreadsheet I tested it on. I&#x27;d love to be shown what I should look at that would give me more insight in my model; I didn&#x27;t see it myself. A real-world example on your website (as opposed to an Iron Man made up one, which to be honest is quite juvenile) would maybe help, too.<p>Good luck with your product. Please don&#x27;t be discouraged by this - I&#x27;m not trying to put you down, just honestly telling you what my experiences were, as you&#x27;ll get very few reactions from people like me who decide to give up after 10 minutes; while those are exactly the ones you want to hear from to know what to work on.",1407230945

It was possible but kludgy.<p>>But it is a pain to integrate any even-loop based app with another app that is not event-loop based.<p>That&#x27;s not where the pain lies. It&#x27;s more the fact that it has its own weird configuration/setup quirks (e.g. its own settings.py, reliance on environment variables, executables).<p>>If you don&#x27;t want serialization then you want a single process both for crawling and for other tasks. This rules out synchronous solutions - you can&#x27;t e.g. integrate a crawler with django efficiently without serialization.<p>I don&#x27;t really want scrapy doing process handling at all. It&#x27;s not particularly good at it. Celery is much better.<p>Using other code to do serialization also doesn&#x27;t necessitate running it on the same process. You can import the django ORM wherever you want and use it to save to the DB. I know you <i>can</i> do that - but, again, kludgy.<p>>It can&#x27;t be a library like requests or mechanize for technical reasons - to make crawling efficient Scrapy uses event loop.<p>I get that. It should have been more like twisted from the outset though. The developers were clearly inspired from django and that led them down a treacherous path.<p>>It can (and should) be a library for twisted/tornado/asyncio; it is possible to use Scrapy as a such library now, but this is not straightforward; this should (and will) be simplified.<p>Well, that&#x27;s good I suppose. I still think that it focuses on bringing together a bunch of mediocre modules for which, individually, you can find much better equivalents. Also, (unlike django) tight, seamless integration between those modules doesn&#x27;t really gain you much.<p>>Celery is also not the easiest piece of software.<p>The problem it is solving (distributed task processing) is not an easy problem. Celery is not simple, but it is GOOD.<p>>Scrapy is just a single Python process that doesn&#x27;t require any databases, etc. Celery requires to deploy a broker and have a place to store task results; it is also less efficient for IO-bound tasks.<p>A) You can use redis as a broker and that&#x27;s trivial to set up. I always have a redis available anyway because I always need a cache of some kind (even when crawling!).<p>B) My crawling tasks are never I/O bound or CPU bound. They&#x27;re bound by the rate limiting imposed upon me by the websites I&#x27;m trying to crawl.<p>C) I&#x27;m usually using celery anyway. I still have to do task processing that DOESN&#x27;T involve crawling. Where do I put that code when I&#x27;m using scrapy?",1407229848

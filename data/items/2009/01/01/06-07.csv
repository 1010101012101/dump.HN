We'll run it through all possible dates.<p>Well, you know, some actions may only have problems on certain dates, so make that all possible actions on all possible dates.<p>Well, you know, maybe the meridian counts. So, make that all possible actions on all possible dates in both the morning and the afternoon.<p>Well, we better test that with all the pathological media files we've built up. So, make that all possible actions on all possible dates in the morning and the afternoon with every one of our three hundred  test music files.<p>Well... what if...<p>In hindsight it's always easy to identify the test that would have revealed the problem. Given the ability of bugs to only manifest when five particularly tricky conditions occur (and let's not even TALK about race conditions!), it simply isn't possible to test them all exhaustively. Unit testing helps, sort of, because it can run through a matrix faster than a human can, but it's also dumber, and even unit testing can't exhaustively search a twelve-dimensional space in any reasonable period of time if it's anything more than binary values in those twelve dimensions.<p>That said, for date processing code, this is definitely something I would have unit tested; that style of date processing is OK if you get it perfect, but definitely inherently problematic. One case where I did write a fairly exhaustive unit test was for billing code with a variable bill-on date; getting every single case exactly correct took me a long time. I was up to about three thousand permutations when I was done, and yeah, I'd see bugs that only struck if you signed up on the 31st of a month followed by a month of 30 days, for instance. Easy to miss if you're writing on a 15th. (And that code was probably thrown away... :( )",1230793152

416282,comment,414330,416088,0,0,calambrac,,,"I agree with basically everything you've said here, except the conclusion that all this means allowing people to avoid being uprooted from their homes is destructive.  This is mainly because I don't think that the argument that ""rent control traps renters in their low-rent apartments"" holds any water - the alternative would have been displacement from the increased rent, and the tenant still wouldn't have been able to find a place in the same area (this terrible articles assertions aside).  Also - price changes contain information, sure, but how is that information being hidden in a rent-control environment?  With increase-on-vacate and no rent-control on newly constructed units, it seems like it's pretty rare that rent-controlled units would be so highly concentrated in an area to mask the true market value.",1230792773

I have seen a couple of people use the site, and they use it to publish short stories and such. They could always post it to a blog, but I think Scribd gives them nice search engine optimization. Even for this legitimate use case, the flash player is a bit of a turn-off for me.<p>But the reason I am not a huge fan is the sheer extent of copyright abuse going on there. Turning a blind eye to it - hiding behind DMCA really - is not kosher, and I frankly wouldn't want to do business that way, no matter what the profit.",1230790651

Here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nUnder the constant scenario, an American who forgoes having a child would save 9,441 tonnes of CO2 – almost six times, on average, the amount of CO2 they would emit in their own lifetime, or the equivalent of making around 2,550 return aero­plane trips between London and New York. If the same American drove a more fuel-efficient car, drastically reduced his or her driving, installed energy-efficient windows, used energy-efficient lightbulbs, replaced a household refrigerator, and recycled all household paper, glass and metal, he or she would save fewer than 500 tonnes.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;",1433815197

The question was asked in the context of your concern about the overhead of interviewing people. You are using a degree as a simple filter, and gender is equally applicable in that regard. Statistically, for our aforementioned example, a suitable candidate will be found in the male population of applicants due to the reasons we already discussed.<p>So, why bother wasting your time and associated costs also interviewing women when you can be reasonably confident that the male candidates will provide someone suitable? It is very possible that a great employee lies in that group of women, and it is very possible that a great employee lies in those without degrees, but you have made it clear that you don&#x27;t have time to evaluate them all.<p><i>> You&#x27;re pretending like there&#x27;s no causal link between education and capability. You are wrong. Period. </i><p>I&#x27;m getting a distinct impression that you haven&#x27;t fully understood my comments. That may very well be my failing, but this becomes a completely pointless discussion if that persists.<p><i>> Hiring someone based upon degree is absolutely no different from hiring someone based upon whether they have prior work experience.</i><p>Absolutely not true. What you are essentially saying is that even among those who have prior experience, you will only hire those whose experience came from Google or Microsoft. There are a number of practical reasons why a perfectly suitable candidate is unable to work at either of those companies before working for you, even though they do come with relevant experience from somewhere else.<p>I understand from your point of view why hiring from only past Google and Microsoft employees is desirable, but what about the people who were unable to work at those places? You really don&#x27;t see the problem with that?",1433814968

I&#x27;ll apologize for being so blunt, but the bullet points for your work experience suck.  They&#x27;re dry and could use additional context.

I was back in Minneapolis in April and the mall was just as crowded as I remember it. We didn&#x27;t really do any shopping (because Amazon Prime), but we sure spent a lot of money at a great restaurant, a few rides in that Nickelodeon thing[1], and more at the Sea Life aquarium [2]. We hung around a bit more to eat ice cream and watch the Twins game in the rotunda on the giant, ~2 story screen.<p>All in all, it was a fun day and it had nothing to do with shopping. So I guess my point is that you might be able to show me that online is eating brick and mortar shopping stores, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be stopping folks from going to the MoA or from building an expansion[3]. Seems that larger malls are transitioning into tourist attractions, though MoA probably always was. Honestly I would never drive to the suburbs to an open air &quot;commons&quot; (because Amazon Prime).

A poverty of the mind. A parochial vision of the possible, narrowed down to such a narrow slice of what might be that it may as well be invisible. They cannot look much beyond their noses. They do not see the natural world as the seething pit of pain and anguish and violent death that it is. They are willing to bow out themselves while condemning animals to that for the foreseeable future.

There will be more biospheres, more tooth and nail evolution.<p>Extinctionists are fixated on relinquishment, a form of cowardice in the face of being challenged by circumstances and change.

Seizing the future and continuing the work that our species has barely started on in the quest to eliminate pain is the high road.<p>And if at the end of the day there are still those who feel that they would like an untrammeled world, well let them build as many as they like - provided that all the species living upon them capable of pain are in fact living in a paradise free from suffering.<p>But heaven forbid we feel any sympathy for those who want to press the game over button now, who cannot raise their eyes just that little bit to see the golden future we could build with just a little more time.",1433813289

So I just pick based upon my perception of your personality/background from the 5-8 range. When asked for justification, I choose the most esoteric-but-not-inconsequential thing I know and bullshit for a minute or two while being personable. Whelp, that was a useful signal as long as your goal as to find a professional bullshitter...<p>Concretely, I&#x27;ve created stand-alone implementations and hacked on compilers for a couple of languages, but would not have a non-BS answer to this question for those languages. Mostly because I&#x27;m totally unfamiliar with the most recent set of popular libraries in that language&#x27;s ecosystem, and also there are certain language features that I know how to implement but don&#x27;t know the canonical usage patterns/idioms. Your standard FooLang dev could probably hack together certain programs in their sleep that would take a week for me to write. But then for other programs -- or especially if you needed a static analysis or optimization -- I could whip it up in a couple of days where the standard FooLang dev would probably take weeks just getting up to speed on the language spec and some particularly thorny parts of the implementation. Hm. Apples and Oranges. And what if you want a static analysis/optimization that exploits idiomatic use of FooLang&#x27;s whizz-bang BarLib? Hm. Not sure who has the upper hand.<p>I know you&#x27;ll say &quot;but that&#x27;s the point -- I want to hear exactly that reasoning so I know what you know/how you assess language familiarity.&quot; But this is all meta -- performance on this question crucially depends upon 1) ability to bullshit (i.e., come up with plausible-sounding hypotheses and give plausible reasons for them, quickly and on-the-spot -- this is not a particularly crucial skill in software development); and 2) ability to intuit the purpose of the question.<p>In conclusion, I&#x27;m not really sure what the point of this exercise is, except to select for bullshitters or people who read your HN posts.<p><i>>  Make them calibrate the scale for you.</i><p>You&#x27;re not just asking for a calibration, you&#x27;re asking for a rubric and a scale.

As a college student it is quite instructive in learning the ropes of becoming a functioning chef-for-one while juggling school and startups.<p>3) <i>What Is Mathematics?</i> - Richard Courant - A great introductory book for the laymen and mathematician alike, much like any good book written by an accomplished mind in a technical field it is both enlightening about the nuances of various areas of the field and a brief yet insightful introduction to each of these (number theory, geometry, topology and calculus).",1433813071

Problem is that this kind of code would be:<p>1. not readable by other programmers (compare 1 line of code to call library function versus e.g. 15 lines of code snippet).<p>2. not clear (libraries have usually some API, some clear input and output, some boundaries). So bugs would be introduces easily. And you would lose more time debugging than you would save disk space... and because it would be not clear, that also would be hard to maintain, to modify such code. You would be unable to make quick changes (what if you needed to change something?)<p>3. When you use libraries you can always compose them, treat one library as filter for another one (for example you can use Physics Engine and connect it to Renderer). If you used only snippets you will practically not be able to make anything more complex than program that outputs Hello World 100 times using 100 different snippets...<p>4. libraries are usually tested by creators and if you use libraries you don&#x27;t have to test library code.<p>But if you used snippets and mix with your own code, you would have to test these snippets also because they would be part of your codebase.<p>5. not properly encapsulated (unless you convert <i>every single snippet</i> into IIFE and inject variables to it as arguments)<p>All above would be obvious...

Those were similarly a clean break from prior OSes, with:<p><pre><code>  - a powerful REPL to call either apps, inline tools, or direct commands\n  - interactive shells made up of mouse-interactable graphical components being\n      printed to the screen\n  - compilation of source code directly into the running image</code></pre>\netc.<p>They were also single-user, but did networking as well.  People logged into a machine remotely could have the same interactive graphical sessions in their own context.<p>Given the history of computing from the 50s - 80s, this desktop architecture idea comes naturally to a lot of people.  The major OSes, however, all have their ancestral lineage which prevents major rethinking.  But another issue is that these ideas are at least power-user oriented.<p>While the mobile market did some major rethinks about the UIs, they&#x27;re still *nix inspired descendants underneath, and don&#x27;t expose anything but pre-baked applications to their users.",1433811658

He certainly encouraged people to think for themselves but anyone whose studied Jobs will tell you he stuck to his own vision.  Your only way to design a product at Apple under Jobs was to make your case to him and change his vision.<p>Steve Jobs did not develop new management theories he showed by example: Well how do you think management theory is born?  Good management theory comes from people who practiced what they preached.<p>Steve Jobs was not a futurist he built the future one piece at a time: WHAT?!?  You don't build the future one piece at a time unless you have a vision of what it will be like as a whole.<p>Steve Jobs was not charismatic he spoke from the heart: WHAT?!?

No, those people are not taking an individualist entrepreneur route that most here on this particular forum are probably more comfortable with. However, the individualist approach cannot solve every problem. Sometimes, a different route is needed.<p>The Occupy Wall Street protests are exactly the kind of process by which people <i>are</i> taking responsibility. Ideas are fermenting there, people are activated, becoming involved at whichever level (political or otherwise). This is not a uniform process - certainly, many people will just be there out of rage, not really becoming activated, but at the same time, many people undergo transformations, gaining knowledge, forming goals, talking about and then attempting concrete steps to get what they want.<p>This is hard to believe if you've never actually been in touch with a movement like this, mostly because it is impossible to see such developments from the outside. I've been personally involved in similar things when I was younger (though at a smaller, local scale), and even I can't see what's going on as an outsider. But believe me, if you think those people are all shouting for somebody else to fix everything for them, you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about.",1317927187

If so, then you are missing the weight of what you said!  Once a company, or nearly any organization, gets big and old, it's nearly standard that the organization becomes arrogant, inwardly directed, and process oriented, has big cases of middle management goal subordination, and has each person fighting with others down the hall instead of the competition outside the building.  Or, people go to work, work their tails off, stay busy, busy, busy, put in long hours, come home dead tired and frustrated, and the organization accomplishes next to nothing because all the effort is lost in internal mud wrestling.<p>The solution mostly is not to 'find a new job' because nearly all organizations of any size are like this.<p>Yes, the solution is to start your own company.<p>This pair of observations is solid now because, really, big organizations in the US -- GE, AT&T, GM, and more -- are dying out due to new technology, small competitors, foreign competition, etc.  The US is regressing to the mean of many old world economies of a lot of small companies with little role for big ones.<p>Once you reach some maturity and begin to understand people,
being good 'socially' gets to be simple enough.  F'get about the struggles in middle school, high school, and college!  So: (1) Have money!  If you don't, then JOB ONE is to make some!  (2) Stand up straight and be confident!  (3) Mostly expect only respect, not loyality or affection.  (4) Work to understand the emotions, fears, frustrations, and aspirations of others and, then, don't rub them the wrong way.<p>For adult women, first on their list is your money:  They want to know that you have money enough to support a family and, further, have the competence to make more such money.<p>For girls in high school, they want to see you as confident and, then, gentle with them, and then perceptive about their emotions.  They want affection, often sex, praise, acceptance, approval, and validation of their worth as girls.  By late high school and in college the young women move your money to the head of their list of what they want.<p>That's about it.",1317925601

This shouldn't be hard given you are a winsdom-sharing based site.

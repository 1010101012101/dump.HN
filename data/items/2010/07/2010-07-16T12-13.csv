1520967,comment,1520660,1520901,0,0,gjm11,,,"It would help to distinguish between (1) antenna detuning because of bridging between the antennas and (2) attenuation because of having a lump of human body next to the antenna. I don't know that that would be directly useful in itself, but it would be interesting. Obvious further experiments: what happens when you add some impedance (resistive and/or capacitive) to the connection between the antennas? what happens if you put a conductive thing, broadly similar to a human hand but better controlled, in various places near the antenna? Etc.<p>The results of doing a bunch of measurements like this could make it much easier to answer questions like: What is it about your hand or your grip or whatever that determines how much you impair reception on your iPhone? How much of the problem would go away if you put various things (kapton tape, rubber bumper, etc.) between the antenna and your hand?<p>Just playing around with actual human hands can give some information of that sort, and if you're only going to do a small amount of investigation you probably get more information that way. But for a deeper understanding of what's going on, you'd want to be more scientific and try harder to decouple different failure mechanisms.<p>(Of course talk is cheap. I haven't done any of that. Not least because I happen not to have an iPhone.)",1279285125

Spellings and usage here generally follow the US, but very few people could even be considered to be fluent speakers.  Hong Kong does still use UK spellings, but Taiwan and Singapore have considerably more US (and in the case of Taiwan, Canadian) influence.  Japan and Korea also favor US spellings.  So do Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and a lot of other places you may never have visited.<p>Maybe you see the attitude as ""provincial"" because you haven't seen much of the world yourself!<p>In any case, from a purely <i>pragmatic</i> view, the US usage is standard.

In fact, you can probably improve how well you do so much that even a mediocre developer can come out looking very good.<p>While this is true, isn't quite unlikely? Why not just invest the time into becoming a /good/ developer.<p>>""How can you detect loops in a singly-linked list without modifying nodes / keeping accounting information around?""<p>What do you mean by ""accounting"" information?<p>In the real-world I'd probably just brute-force it and keep around a set of elements already gone over.

As of now, it doesn't really provide any substantive benefits.<p>Unlike jeb and mensamember, I have it listed on my resume, at the bottom, in 'other', along with toastmasters experience, some public speaking activities, and other misc stuff.  For me it wasn't so much wanting to 'brag' about it, but it felt like another facet of who I am (albeit a very minor one).  It's also meant as an indicator that, objectively, there's a certain amount of quantifiable innate talent/skill I possess which can be harnessed for problems.<p>Specifically in the resume/job context, whether or not I completely understand the industry you're working in (perhaps I have no direct industry experience), ideally the Mensa qualification should indicate that I have the capacity to get up to speed quickly on the new industry and other facets of your company/business. If someone is that offended by me stating something like that about myself, they wouldn't like working with me anyway.

I qualified for Mensa a few years back, but used tests scores from the 80s.  A couple years ago I took some IQ tests (friend's wife needed to administer IQ tests to adults, and had a hard time finding volunteers).  These tests were completely different instruments, administered by different people over 20 years ago, and statistically they put my 'intelligence' in pretty much the same spot.  Not much had changed over 20 years.  The tests seem to test something deeper than things you can 'train' for.  If you took the same test multiple times, perhaps you'd get a better score, but that's not an accurate indicator then, is it?",1279282978

Anybody who has money betting on where an item shows up in a result list should not also be able to create the list. This is like going to the Ford car dealership and asking for an analysis of all the types of cars to buy. Even if the Ford guys give you an independently-created report recognized as the world's best authority on car purchases, it doesn't feel right. In ethics, if it looks wrong, it is wrong.<p>Having said that, regulating anything that returns a list is idiotic. Even regulating Google because of it's gatekeeper status doesn't work -- these things always sound good for the edge cases, but once you let the camel's nose in under the tent, the rest of the camel is soon to follow<p>I think what's called for here is an industry-sponsored certification program. Use outside auditors, establish quality metrics, create a set of public ethical guidelines. You can always have trusted outsiders check your work against those guidelines, even in IP-rich, and trade secret areas. Companies do this all the time.<p>Google's (and Microsoft before it) main problem is that it is successful.

In this case I'm on Google's side.<p>But as far as thinking Google is somehow magic, that SEO is evil, that ""writing good content"" is all you need for rankings? All of that is bullshit put out by Google to make themselves more of an authority than they actually are. They run a program to put things in an ordered list. People are going to hack the program. Neither of these two things are good, bad, or especially interesting. The interesting thing here, to me, is the degree of Google fanboy-ism that some folks have. Wish I could bottle that up.<p>Google is just an advertising agency who had some cool ideas on ranking a decade or more ago. They are not a bunch of knights riding in on white horses.

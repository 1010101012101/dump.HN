5081291,comment,5080350,5080350,5,0,tripzilch,,,"Hm, they could also have tagged the file as ""came from the Internet"" in the filesystem metadata associated with the file itself. That way, the ""came from the Internet"" tag is only around as long as it needs to: for the lifetime of the file. Avoiding the privacy problem, but also more sensible for another reason:<p>If you'd rename or copy the file, the ""came form the Internet"" tag will remain or be copied with the file. With the sqlite database approach, either this association breaks, or you need to check the database every time a file is copied, moved or renamed and if it's in there, update the database, if you want to be able to track a file when it's copied or renamed.<p>I don't know if OSX has extra logic for this, or if they just allow the association to break. But with the metadata tagging approach, you only have to run the tagging logic when the file is downloaded (to set the tag) and when it's about to be executed (to check the tag), not with every other file-operation.<p>A strange choice, IMO: the sqlite approach makes it <i>harder</i> to achieve the intended goal because you need extra effort/logic required to track a file as it's copied, renamed or moved, while at the same time it makes it <i>easier</i> for an unintended goal: tracking users by keeping the information about the file around even when it's deleted and the ""came from the Internet"" warning is no longer useful.",1358546133

But depending on your workload this may be a blessing in disguise because if you're parsing a very long stream of unstructured data you'll have to re-implement most of that buffering logic in your own code to deal with the inevitable corner cases where your data overlaps the borders of the buffersize chosen. The obvious optimization here is to pre-allocate a buffer of the right size and read in the data in one go but for a stream of unknown and possibly infinite length (such as used in a filter like this) that is not possible.<p>So f* function have their place, even in optimized code, but should be used with care. If you're reading data with fixed size blocks (such as in this example) then yes, a simple 'read' call will likely be faster, because as you note the read call will place the data directly into a user accessible buffer without the need to go through more library calls to get at the data.

First, government press releases like to trumpet the maximum theoretical numbers. Authors of the press releases will just count up the crimes and the add up the theoretical maximum punishments while largely or completely ignoring the reality of the likely much lower sentence. The practice is generally justified by its possible general deterrent value: perhaps word of the high punishment faced in theory will get to others who might commit the crime and will scare them away. And unfortunately, uninformed reporters who are new to the crime beat sometimes pick up that number and report it as truth. A lot of people repeat it, as they figure it must be right if it was in the news. And some people who know better but want you to have a particular view of the case repeat it, too.

The amount of variety between different glyphs and other factors such as kerning which help the letters combine to make an elegant whole word. A classic example of how not to do this is blackletter; all the glyphs are so similar that at a glance, the text looks like variable length blocks of repeated characters. It is also very hard to read.<p>In my experience, many computer fonts also fall into this trap. By trying to establish a consistent theme or feel to the glyphs, they iron out all the letters' individual quirks that make them easy to distinguish and recognise, thus readability suffers.<p>I think in terms of readability, the sans/serif issue is largely irrelevant (as the article might suggest).",1358544349

Yes, it can certainly take a deep and ugly dive in that direction. Let's have a discussion about how entrepreneurs can protect themselves in this environment.<p>Legal equality only exists when there's a good impedance match between the parties involved in litigation.<p>If you, as a small to medium entrepreneur, tangle with a large entity you could very well be screwed.  It really doesn't matter who is right.  He who has more money can prevail in spite of the facts by causing financial pain.  You either give-up or go broke fighting.  You are not receiving the same kind of ""justice"" they can effectively buy.<p>The same applies (sadly, apparently Aaron's case) to situations in which the government sinks it's teeth into you.  The whole idea of government-provided public defenders sounds great.  Then you realize that it is the equivalent of a call-center support person who's script always seems to call for erasing the operating system.  In other words, not a very good option when your life and liberty are at stake.<p>Again, I don't want to have this become a discussion about politics.  I think we can generally agree that our country is navigating an incredible surreal political period when it seems impossible to get even the most sensible things done.  Nobody is going to fix this until a significant tipping point of some sort is reached.  It's the ""waiting for Superman"" syndrome.  Don't count on it.<p>When the justice you get is directly proportional to how much money you can spend you can't really call it justice. I'm not sure we can even call it ""the rule of law"".<p>So, then, how does one protect life, property and the good-old pursuit of happiness when faced with the potential for being on the wrong side of this equation?  What should entrepreneurs do (or not)?  How have you dealt with it yourself?",1358544263

Most plastics were too brittle and would crack when you snapped them on the iPhone. In fact, only 1 ABS was usable. The consumer models had a hard time with the curved surfaces and felt much grainier in the hand. But once I tried out the final soft-touch part that was produced using injection modeling, I would never go back to the 3D printed model. The difference it feels in your hand is night and day. Oh, and the mass produced cases cost < $.10 per unit. I think we spend more on packing than parts themselves.<p>3D printers are great for prototyping and hobbyists doing 1-offs.

5081018,comment,5070508,5074621,1,0,parasubvert,,,"RIM didn't have a specific ""failed model"" that led to a collapse in margin.  They were a case of slow death, with warning signs beginning even in 2007 with market share instability as the global market for smartphones exploded.  Actually you could point to the failure of the Storm in 2008 as their inability to adapt to a touchscreen-centric device, though that didn't directly lead to a margin collapse - just part of an overall slow market share whithering. A lot of these failures were hidden due to RIM's internal explosive growth through 2010, keeping their eyes off how much more Apple and Samsung were growing.<p>So for Apple, the two areas to watch out for will be:  market and profit share losses (so far Android has not been growing at Apple's expense- that may change), and whether they fail with a major ""me too"" feature that another carrier brings to market and has big success with.  The latter I havent seen any real sign of.  The former, there's a question mark if Android can successfully kill margins in the mobile phone space through their market share to a point that hurts everyone (Samsung, Apple, etc) but mostly Apple.  On the other hand, Android is buying its market share from being a fully Google-subsidized set of software with no licensing fees.  Is that sustainable?<p>As for lock-in, surely the success of iTunes and the integration of AirPlay across all devices has caused significant lock in?  I mean, media options in the Android world pale in comparison, only Microsoft Xbox Live really has a comparable selection of movies and tv shows.  Similarly, the App Store selection have been a huge advantage to Apple with strong equivalents being slow to appear on Play.<p>So of course, to your last point, if Apple doesn't keep making compelling upgrades, their fortunes will decline.  but that goes for EVERY manufacturer that wishes to make a profit.  if the Samsung Galaxy S4 isn't compelling, wouldn't that benefit Nokia and HTC and Apple?  Samsung's profit growth too is almost exclusively driven from Smartphones - their other product lines aren't as profitable.<p>Ultimately I think Apple has many risks ahead but I don't think they're as fragile as you seem to believe.",1358543184

This is possible, in that we do it, so how?<p>March through February of last year my wife and I were living with another couple (who we met via craigslist, both couples hoping to save money) in a three bedroom apartment in Somerville MA.  Food was communal, and we took turns cooking.  All numbers I'm giving are per person per month.<p>utilities+food+household goods: $110.  This included heat, hot water, internet, electricity.  AC only in one room, and only on a few very hot days.  By cooking our own food and not eating out we saved a lot of money.<p>clothing+other optionals: $150.  My wife and I each give ourselves an 'allowance' for discretionary spending.  Clothing, eating out, cell phones, entertainment.  Clothing we mostly buy at the local thrift store.  They have good clothing quite cheap.  I'd go down once a month or so to look through things for an hour maybe.  My phone now is $30/month and has unlimited texts and data (via t-mobile) but at the time I didn't have a phone (preferred to spend the money on other things).<p>transportation: $60.  Unlimited public transit pass. (This is now $70.)<p>laundry: We did our laundry with a hand-crank machine at the apartment.  Not worth it; too much work.  When we used to use a coin-op washer that was about $20/month for two people ($2/load, 2 loads a week) so $10.  We would hang clothes to dry, which also makes them last longer.<p>renters insurance: not worth it.  Better to have savings.  If our apartment had burned down we wouldn't have lost much of replacement value anyway.<p>credit card: if we couldn't afford it we didn't get it.  Credit cards are a trap.<p>medical: paid for by my work.  If we were buying it on our own that would cost about $150.<p>This comes to $480 (counting the health insurance costs and laundry).<p>(We're still spending a similar amount, somewhat less now, but I don't have the data as well organized.)<p>Why are we living so frugally?

Crispin Porter & Bogusky is one of the best agencies in the world, and they have proven it year after year - there's no doubt they know exactly where they are heading with these ads.  If Microsoft is truly balking at letting them ""do their thing"", it's too bad.  CP&B knows what they are doing and Microsoft may continue looking cold and stale if they don't let Alex & Co. do what they do best.",1221706707

307812,comment,307057,307764,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"1) Until I can find a better business at a better price, adjusted for tax consequences?<p>2) It's impossible to usefully answer this question without recursing into nihilism. Consider: I think there's an 80% chance that BioCo's new drug will be a hit, and the stock will go from $5 to $10. Does ""What if you're wrong?"" mean I dial up the uncertainty everywhere (70% chance of going from $5 to somewhere between $8 and $12?). Okay, fine. Now I think there's a 70% chance that the new drug will be a hit, and the stock will trade between $8 and $12. But what if I'm wrong? Well, it must be time to dial up the uncertainty <i>even more</i> -- 50/50 chance of trading between $5 and $15, perhaps.<p>It doesn't add any useful information to just keep second-guessing oneself, or to have a rule that amounts to ""Be less certain than you usually are, except about the statement ""Be less certain than you usually are, except about the statement ""Be less certain..."""""" It's good to collect enough information to consider different scenarios, but it does no good to blindly assume that you're wrong about a given stock.<p><i>As for becoming overexposed... if you've got Stock/Index A that is allocated for 10% of your portfolio and the market price doubles, you're allocation is now 20% (all things being equal). So you need to adjust your position sizing, unless you want to have 20% of your assets under that particular security. That's part of portfolio rebalancing and money management. If the price of a security goes down and you want to have the same exposure in it, then you would buy more to maintain it.</i><p>That's true. In a scenario like the one we have now, that would imply buying. Also, holding (until a better deal comes along).<p><i>I also don't think people really take asset classes into account, mainly because there's not a lot of money in their portfolio to be truly diversified.</i><p>I'm not sure what this means. Asset-class allocators don't seem to get better results than people who buy good businesses at good prices. At least, I see fewer people who <i>allocate</i> their way onto the <i>Forbes 400</i>.",1221705907

307801,comment,306438,306670,0,0,nradov,,,"It's not the absolute size that's a problem but rather the degree of leverage. If you've borrowed $30 for every $1 in capital (like Bear Sterns did) and your assets all drop by about 3% then you immediately become insolvent. They thought they could prevent that from happening through clever hedging and diversification but it didn't work.\nA possible solution might be to set hard legal limits on size versus leverage for financial companies. But in practice I'm not sure how practical it would be to write regulations to enforce that.",1221704773

132936,comment,132873,132873,0,0,dmoney,,,"I haven't been a part of a startup, but I'm at a company that's been reorganizing around an agile methodology, paying some lip service to ""self-organizing teams.""  I think one of the problems with doing this is that if this methodology is imposed from the top down, you get the sense that this is ""just a bunch of crap that management is making us do"".  So I think a good idea would be to have the team figure out how they want to do this reorganization (possibly suggesting the kind of atmosphere you're going for).  That way they will have some stake in making this work, because it was partially their idea.<p>Secondly, in a startup, in an early stage, it's a couple guys in a garage, and there is no management.  That means if it's like a startup, it's a problem to try and factor you as a manager into the equation.  So you should make a deal up front what kind of management you will do.  Just keeping upper management off their backs?  Or will you be on the team yourself in some capacity?",1205124424

All browsers (that fully support javascrpit) I've tried were very slow.<p>I don't get why it's so slow. Aren't there efficient ways to execute javascript? I mean, GUIs in python, perl and other interpreted languages aren't nearly as slow as a javascript GUI, like gmail's e-mail client. What's going on here?",1205124311

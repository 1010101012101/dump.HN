If there&#x27;s ever any doubt how to do something, the Arch Wiki will show you how to do it, often 5 different ways.<p>One of the biggest pluses of Arch is the Arch User Repository. If a package for something doesn&#x27;t exist, someone will put it in the AUR for you. Whenever some software is released for a specific Linux distro, I assume Arch gets it too and I&#x27;m almost always right. I like Mint Linux&#x27;s UI a lot (that&#x27;s Mint Linux&#x27;s main selling point) so I installed it on Arch with one command. Steam only worked with Ubuntu when it was released for Linux... except I installed it on Arch with one command the next day. Spotify is tricky to get for Linux unless you use a Debian based distro... or Arch, in which case it&#x27;s in the AUR ready to be installed with one command.<p><a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_compared_to_other_distributions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_compared_to_other_...</a>",1412780345

2. which methods are called a lot.<p>Even 2. can be of marginal use.  A lot of times, it&#x27;s not surprising a method is called a lot, and not clear whether those calls are indicative of a performance problem.  There are times, though, where a method is called a lot more than you expected, in which case it might be the clue to solving the performance problem.<p>For 1., it&#x27;s usually click down through the call stack for the most expensive top level method, while there is still a single method taking up a good fraction of the overall time.<p>Hopefully the stopping point will still be a method you wrote, and not a library call.  If it&#x27;s your code, you likely have the ability to fix the performance problem by changing your code.  If it&#x27;s a library call, you might need to be a little more creative, in finding an alternative approach, or better understanding what that library call is doing under the hood.<p>So for me, the profiler just tells me I&#x27;m looking at the right general part of the code when trying to improve performance, and that&#x27;s about it.",1412780248

Are you talking about undue importance given to small parties in such systems?<p>No. The proportional list system prevents representativeness. The people whose name is on the list represent the one that put them on it. They do not represent the electors.<p>> Separation of powers: not happening in Spain. The most voted political party in the legislative elections forms government.<p>> That&#x27;s not how separation of power works...<p>Exactly. I was explaining what happens in Spain.<p>> Imperative mandate: Sieyes abolished it during the French Revolution and it still to be restored in all Europe. The elected candidates in the legislative elections should remain loyal to their promises.<p>> I&#x27;m also not sure what you mean by &quot;imperative mandate&quot;. As for promises... well, there are promises and there is political expediency.<p>The electors should have a contract with their representative and if they are not loyal to that contract they can be ceased.<p>> Different elections: for executive and legislative (like in France)<p>> I&#x27;m stopping you right here. It makes very little difference in practice, since the elections for the lower chamber happen right after the presidential elections. I also don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a benefit in general. It suffers from the idiotic, anti-democratic first-past-the-post system. I&#x27;d rather have a token President and a PM coming from a coalition instead.<p>It makes sense if you think about the different characteristics that you look for in a legislator in contrast to the values required to be a president. A legislator should be loyal to their representatives (a part) whereas what you are looking in a governor is intelligence to guide the Nation (all). It is nonsense to think that a good legislator could be a good PM (UK). Loyalty vs intelligence, that&#x27;s why it should be different elections.",1412780143

I&#x27;ve been spending the last couple of weeks reading as much as I can on figuring out the right balance between what remains of my life (I&#x27;m very close to 50) and how much money I should save up. I have been self employed for the vast majority of my career and have always aimed at providing for my own pension rather than to have some external party take care of that (because I don&#x27;t like to give that kind of control to institutions that I really do not trust and that lack transparency).<p>So I&#x27;ve been saving like a squirrel over the years and even though it&#x27;s been adding up nicely I never could shake the feeling that it wasn&#x27;t enough. I also do not have a disability insurance (it is absolutely un-affordable where I live).<p>Suppose all your income streams related to work would dry up tomorrow and you&#x27;d be stuck with withdrawing from savings or living off the interest / dividends of your money or investments (technically of course also a source of income), how long could you survive?<p>(reminder that a vote in the poll is not a vote <i>for</i> the poll!)",1412779566
8427113,comment,8424502,8426892,0,0,drostie,,,"One thing that was exciting about Datomic to me (and still is, I just don&#x27;t have any projects big enough to use it for) is that you get an immutable database state. You can emulate this in any normal database, but it gets harder to enforce the discipline among other members of your team. The basic idea is that you can serialize those same closures by just pointing to &quot;the state of the database at revision #5968&quot;, and then, though the database moves on, you can always use that ID to compute the view of that database at that point. It does the same &quot;heavy lifting&quot; that storing these closures is doing, but you can easily share that ID across a distributed service with no &quot;expired links&quot; problems.<p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> send a closure in a non-functional context. That is, if Alice sends a closure to Bob, it cannot any longer be the case that Alice&#x27;s other operations can mutate Bob&#x27;s state. So you must be serializing an &quot;orphaned&quot; environment tree with a bunch of closures which point at different nodes of that tree.<p>You could definitely do this even better by stealing some ideas from Smalltalk: encapsulate all of the states in some computational node (the original notion of &quot;object&quot; in OOP) which interacts with all of the other parts of the system communicate with by message-passing, and nothing else. To change the code on-the-fly, you just swap out the &quot;code part&quot; of some node for a new code part, and perhaps transform the state, queuing up the messages while you do so; then you can start replaying those messages to the new code. The benefit is that now at any time the nodes can move around servers arbitrarily, as long as you&#x27;ve got a good name-resolution service to tell you where the object is now.<p>In other words: (1) interpret all the things so that code and data are the same; (2) shared-state is your enemy; serialize orphaned states only; (3) you have to explicitly handle the case where someone makes a request while you are sending their closure to another server.",1412779559

We would go to industry events with, say, 20,000 CPG food products, but of those there were maybe only 5 - 10 per year that were interesting enough to actually be worth talking about. And even reaching out to contract manufacturers directly to get new products at the very beginning of the pipeline yielded limited results.<p>We were actually offered funding, but ended up shutting down the startup instead because we found that while we could make money doing bespoke projects for companies with large budgets, the market just wasn&#x27;t there to build the products that we initially wanted to build.

8427044,comment,8421594,8426020,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"Yep, although it doesn&#x27;t actually diverge; that&#x27;s the point ;)<p>The classic &quot;loop&quot; function, which is completely polymorphic, does diverge:<p><pre><code>    loop :: a
    loop = loop
</code></pre>
&quot;loop&quot; will never return a value, since to perform one &#x27;step&#x27;, it must perform an &#x27;infinite&#x27; amount of computation.<p>The function you&#x27;ve written doesn&#x27;t diverge, since it will immediately return a value &quot;Later x&quot; after one step. As long as we&#x27;re using laziness, it doesn&#x27;t matter that &quot;x&quot; itself is &#x27;infinite&#x27;:<p><pre><code>    loop&#x27; :: Partial a
    loop&#x27; = Later loop&#x27; 
</code></pre>
Note that we can do an equivalent thing in strict languages, by eta-expanding our definitions into thunks:<p><pre><code>    data Partial&#x27; a = Now a | Later (() -> Partial a)

    loop&#x27;&#x27; :: () -> Partial a
    loop&#x27;&#x27; _ = Later loop&#x27;&#x27;
</code></pre>
We can use &quot;loop :: a&quot; in place of &quot;undefined :: a&quot;, since they have the same type. We can&#x27;t use &quot;loop&#x27; :: Partial a&quot; in the same way, since its type is different.<p>&quot;loop&#x27; :: Partial a&quot; is a bit like a &#x27;phantom type&#x27;, where the &quot;a&quot; in its type signature never actually occurs in the value. In fact, we can define a type which doesn&#x27;t contain &quot;Now&quot;, and is thus <i>guaranteed</i> to never terminate:<p><pre><code>    data Inf a = Inf (Inf a)
</code></pre>
Of course, the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;Inf a&quot; is a true phantom: it doesn&#x27;t affect the values at all. We can get rid of it to obtain:<p><pre><code>    data Loop = Loop Loop
</code></pre>
We can use this type to &quot;drive&quot; main loops for servers, operating systems, games, etc. in a total language:<p><pre><code>    server :: Loop -> IO Loop
    server (Loop x) = do req <- readRequest
                         sendResponse (process req)
                         Loop <$> server x
</code></pre>
&quot;Loop&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Stream ()&quot;, where:<p><pre><code>    data Stream a = Cons a (Stream a)
</code></pre>
Of course, &quot;Stream a&quot; is to &quot;[a]&quot; what &quot;Inf a&quot; is to &quot;Partial a&quot;: it&#x27;s just missing the base-case (&quot;[]&quot; and &quot;Now a&quot;, respectively).<p>Interestingly, we can think of &quot;Partial a&quot; as being like &quot;[a]&quot;, except that it stores elements in &quot;[]&quot; rather than &quot;:&quot;. Alternatively, we can think of &quot;Partial a&quot; as being like &quot;Nat&quot; (the Peano numbers), which uses an element of &quot;a&quot; in place of &quot;Zero&quot;.",1412778775

8427012,comment,8425501,8425501,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Couple of comments:<p>1. I know of weev from hacker circles. He really is this douchetastic. But what&#x27;s really insane to me is that there&#x27;s a bunch of women in the hacker scene who <i>adore him</i>. I couldn&#x27;t quite understand it, until I saw them also adore Adrian Lamo, and so my theory is very close to Kathy&#x27;s here: hero worship distorts reality. In order to stop people from enabling abusive trolls like this, someone has to debunk the hero status. Which is a lot more difficult than it sounds.<p>2. Being a troll is about one thing, and one thing only: power. The power to abuse someone and laugh and get away with it. The essential requirement of trolling is that you make someone upset. So there&#x27;s a very real requirement that you do not respond in the way the troll wants in order for them to put their attention on something else. But trolls are varied, and sometimes they&#x27;ll just keep plugging away at you. In cases like these you have to change tactics, though there&#x27;s no guarantee anything will definitely put them off.<p>3. In general, trolls have goals. Usually it&#x27;s to harass you until you literally disappear into the ether. Once they can&#x27;t find any trace of you anymore, they have nothing left to do, and so they find another target. In this sense it&#x27;s sometimes necessary to literally leave the [online or physical] community you face harassment in, or find a way to force the troll out of it. In either case it&#x27;s basically a war, and you have to decide to either abandon the area or fight it out to the death.<p>4. I believe I understand why she was targeted. She has opinions that some people <i>hate</i>. Why, I have no frigging idea; ask a shrink. The point is, when people hate something, they lash out. And the internet is basically a hate delivery mechanism. And here&#x27;s my opinion that will probably get me downvoted into hell: there is no way to stop this, other than leaving the internet.<p>Editorial rant (sorry about the length):<p>Being abused was not Kathy&#x27;s fault. Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t have to do <i>anything at all</i> to be abused on the internet. Just your picture, or a handle, or <i>anything</i> can be fodder for trolls. You can do absolutely nothing but exist and people will still try to abuse you.<p>In my opinion, from what I know of the internet, there is virtually no way to stop someone that hates you from abusing you here. There are no closed systems on the internet. E-mail is public, Twitter is intended to be public, but even if you make it private there&#x27;s still a picture and a handle to start with (AND you can still direct tweets at private accounts), with Facebook you can avoid non-friends but not on comment sections, and on top of it all these accounts can be hacked. Private information like address, SS#, phone, etc can all be gotten incredibly, stupidly easily, without you <i>ever going online</i>. The internet is the easiest attack platform there is.<p>If you are visible in any way, you are a potential target for trolls, period. And I don&#x27;t see any simple solution to any of this. We could re-design our internet services to protect people&#x27;s privacy and anonymity better from abuse, but this wouldn&#x27;t protect people who want to <i>publish works</i> like Kathy has. We could try to develop better tools to combat trolling, but that might become an arms race, who knows. Maybe we need to require a ss# and a picture ID for people to make accounts on social media. But regular accounts might just get hacked to be used as sock puppets.<p>So perhaps there is no technical solution. Perhaps we just need to change the way our entire society treats itself, both online and off. <i>Peacefully</i> boycott sources of abuse, negativity, ridicule and scorn online (i&#x27;m looking at you, every-forum-on-the-internet). Combat the causes of insecurity and fear and hate. Provide more social services to support the emotional welfare of all people. Something other than band-aids and coalitions. Maybe it&#x27;ll never happen in our lifetimes, but at some point we&#x27;ve got to sit down and figure out a way to encourage people to be compassionate, or we&#x27;re all doomed in the much larger picture of world-wide human affairs.",1412778470

That&#x27;s an individual choice. Free speech and free thought should not mean that anybody give anybody else a free pass to cause harm or spread ideas that are likely to cause harm - and we should use every right we have to ensure this, so long as it doesn&#x27;t end up with people losing their rights to food, water, shelter, and (a duty of the Government and the people) protection from direct abuse.<p>Your right to freedom of speech do not mean that I have to listen to you, interact with you, or provide a platform for you, no matter whether I&#x27;m one person or a multinational.

That said, readers should be aware that the closures approach is a dead end for a large & complex service: unless you can figure out how to serialize the full closure state to data that can be exchanged between machines, you&#x27;re always going to be RAM-constrained and subject to machine failure.<p>The loss of state isn&#x27;t a big deal for a news site, but if you lost the user&#x27;s state in the middle of a significant process (e.g. dropping the cart mid-checkout), it would be a big problem, even if it was infrequent.<p>What would be great if a language provided a convenient way to repose closures into data blobs that could be exchanged between machines or sent via the browser (an untrusted channel that would have to be secured with cryptography). That said, it&#x27;s not obvious how to capture the semantics of the full closure of the system state without significant work (look at how fragile object serialization / pickling is).

Do you mean automatically watching and compiling on changes?<p>I mean that a javascript library would act as a gate to live-compile Javascript files on-the-fly.<p>For example, with ES6-Module-Loader[1], you can do something like this in your browser :<p><pre><code>    <script>
        System.import(&#x27;mymodule&#x27;).then(function(m) {

&#x27;mymodule&#x27; can be an uncompiled ES6 module, the code will still work fine, because ES6-Module-Loader will get its content (XHR), resolve its dependencies, then pass everything to Traceur.<p>Obviously its main use is for debug purpose (since it does a request for each source file, which won&#x27;t be great until HTTP 2), but it allows to have a full ES6 workflow, without any visible compilation pass.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader</a>",1412776972

It appears that the established parties do not dare touch big visions any more. In itself, I expect most people would actually be happy with this, as long as it works. The problem is that in most of Europe it doesn&#x27;t: the recovery from the financial crisis in the Eurozone is now actually lagging the recovery from the Great Depression.<p>And yet, my experience in Germany is that there is complete silence about the failure of politics. When polls show low approval for policies, even journalists tend to excuse this by saying that the policies just haven&#x27;t been explained properly to the population. The possibility that the mainstream consensus regarding Eurozone policies might be wrong is not seriously considered. There is no serious intelligent debate about political choices.<p>This is also a failure of journalism. I had some hope when Frank Schirrmacher, one of the editors of the FAZ, a very influential serious newspaper, made steps towards raising the possibility that the mainstream consensus is wrong. Unfortunately, he died recently.<p>Ultimately, people feel misrepresented by the mainstream parties. The result is a mixture of apathy in the form of dropping participation in elections, and remaining voters going to the non-mainstream parties, which tend to be more extreme.",1412776873

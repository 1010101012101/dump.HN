the question is, why you can´t finish your designs?
a very common problem is perfectionism. if you´re trying things out, change stuff all times and never are really content with the results, then you´re propably a perfectionist (which is totally ok).
if so, it means you really care about the stuff you´re doing, wich is very good. actually it means that perhaps you are caring a bit too much.
sometimes you won´t find the perfect solution. the hard part is to learn/accept that you won´t find it.

There seems to be a similar effect between Linux and BSD. I'm not going to claim that BSD is objectively superior in every regard, but on average, the BSD community seems to be quite a bit better informed than the Linux community. It may just be because Linux is so much more visible.

I started it 1 week ago following a reboot.  One week later I noticed the PC's mem usage was nearing the amount of physical memory and investigated; one contributor turned out to be the JVM session running this app: according to Task Manager, this app (actively monitoring <i>no items</i> during the week) was consuming over 100M of memory.  Now, I won't stop using it, because I'm not aware of a better tool, and restarting it is not particularly painful, and yes, it's likely this app wouldn't exist w/o the ease of programming offered by Java (though I would prefer a GUI-less version written in a language I am fluent in), but still: 100M of memory for a web-polling app that was essentially idling (from an end-user perspective)?  I've observed that various JVM apps gravitate to these (to me) giant memory footprints over time; I assume it's ""the nature of the beast"", but I'm speaking as a programmer who has never written a line of Java.

It just depends how you interpret the word ""everyone"". Is it a single representative object which takes on the combined characteristics of all the people it represents? Or is it a stand-in for comparing each and every person that it represents?<p>You're saying it must be the latter. If you're talking about person A, person B, and person C, then ""everyone"" is short hand for comparing against each one. So, ""Is everyone tall?"" means ""Is A tall?"" AND ""Is B tall?"" AND ""Is C tall?""<p>However, that isn't the only valid way it's used. ""Everyone"" could be its own object, so you don't need to check against each of the underlying ones. And it only has a certain characteristic when each of the underlying people has that characteristic. So, if Person A is short and has green eyes, person B is of average height and has green eyes, and person C is tall and has green eyes, then ""Everyone"" takes on the green eyes characteristic, but not the ""short"" one. Hence, ""Everyone"" has green eyes, but ""everyone"" isn't short.<p>It sounds convoluted when spelled out that way, but I think each usage of everyone is both valid and used by English speakers. When considering ""everyone doesn't want to be entrepreneurs"", I can mentally switch between the two cases. ""Everyone doesn't want to be entrepreneurs"" could incorrectly mean Person A doesn't want to be an entrepreneur AND person B doesn't want to AND person C, etc.... It could ALSO mean the word ""everyone"" did not take on the ""wants to be an entrepreneur"" characteristic BECAUSE there existed people in the group that did not have it. In that case, the statement ""interpreted logically"" is just what was intended.<p>For this reason, when I read the original statement, I didn't notice anything odd about it at all.",1269185400

For a long time, I couldn't tolerate melatonin.  I would feel like I wasn't fully awake for up to three days after taking it.  When my health improved enough that I could tolerate it, I still needed co-q-10 in the morning to feel fully awake.<p>Co-q-10 is the co-enzyme of melatonin and wakes your brain up in the morning.  It is made in the body in a complex (17 step?) process.  A bottleneck at any stage can leave you deficient, so many people are deficient.  If you take co-q-10 in the morning, your body will produce a small melatonin spike about 12 or so hours later.  If you take melatonin, it does not increase production of co-q-10.  So taking co-q-10 can do a lot more in terms of healing both sides of waking/sleeping cycle of the brain chemistry.  It is also gentler/subtler than melatonin.<p>Lots of people use melatonin to good effect, so I'm not trying to knock it.

I'm in no way qualified to be talking about this.<p>I have a fairly severe form of delayed sleep-phase syndrome: left to my own devices, as when I was on summer vacation back in school, I would gladly stay awake for 24 hours and sleep for 12. I've long noticed anecdotally this pattern is associated with geeks. Ask yourself: if a 6:00 AM Twitter update says your geekiest friend is waiting for his code to compile, is it because he woke up early or because he hasn't been to bed yet?<p>It turns out there's a reason for this. There's a gene called the ASMT gene, which codes for enzymes responsible (in part) for the synthesis of melatonin from serotonin in the pineal gland. This gene is often deleted in individuals with autism or Aspergers syndrome, which results in <i>extremely</i> low levels of serum melatonin. The effect is so strong that even family members of autistic children, even those not themselves diagnosed with autism or Aspergers, have been shown to have abnormally depressed melatonin levels. More information: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2199264/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2199264/</a><p>Melatonin is one of the biggest chemical regulators of the sleep cycle in humans, and increased melatonin at night has been shown experimentally to reduce the time of sleep onset. I'm not aware of any studies comparing the effect size between autistic/Aspergers patients and healthy controls, but it stands to reason that the former group might stand more to gain.<p>I've personally experienced <i>tremendous</i> benefit in my sleep patterns from taking melatonin. I spent my entire teenage life showing up to classes in a sleep-deprived haze because I wasn't aware of this. Hopefully I can save someone else from that.<p>Now, for the catch: We have no idea why Aspergers symptoms are associated with reduced melatonin synthesis. Melatonin is a regulator of neural plasticity during fetal and early childhood brain development. Melatonin is synthesized from serotonin, and serotonin levels at various stages of development are drastically different in autistics/Aspergers compared to healthy children. We don't know to what extent these are causes or effects of autistic symptoms, and what effect there might be on development from long-term melatonin supplementation during early childhood. However, in healthy adults, the safety of long-term melatonin use, even at doses many <i>dozens</i> of times higher than the maximum clinically effective dose, has been shown to be completely safe. How you generalize from that is up to you.",1269184427

Re: login, sorry, it's drupal and I turned off anonymous comments for spam reasons.  :)<p>I'm sorry that you think that I'm naive.  I'm 41 years old and have a CS degree.  I've been a linux programmer and sysadmin since 1993, before linux had a 1.0 kernel (0.99.9.45 or something like that when I installed my first linux machine).  My background is in programming and I spent my college career in 1990-1994 writing mostly C code.<p>Java <i>is</i> slow, although most java programmers don't want to admit it.  When you take into account resource bloat, java is still a horrible choice for almost any application unless you work for a company with a lot of money that's willing to just throw money at hardware because the software developers say it's needed.<p>If you'd like to compare apples-to-apple, it's going to be hard because people don't usually write the exact same app in more than one language unless they're doing benchmark tests of something simple (usually hello world, or a matrix operation or something), but not real world applications.<p>I realize that I'm sticking my neck out there for criticism, but I'm ok with it.  A lot of web programmers are java engineers - young kids coming out of school with a java background and they don't want to even deal with C because they don't want to do the manual memory management or watch for return codes, but instead just wrap the whole function in a try/catch handler.  To me, it's laziness.  C and C++ are almost the same syntactically to java.  You guys <i>can</i> write C or C++, you just choose not to.  For me, being a sysadmin for a living now, this is just a lazy and wasteful choice.<p>If you were to write your code in something more ""close to the metal"" just think how much more awesome your programs could be!",1269184344

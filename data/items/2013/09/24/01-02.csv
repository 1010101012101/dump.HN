6435406,comment,6427194,6431508,1,0,bennyg,,,"The thing is, I&#x27;m not rolling my own here (minus message authentication, but based on cursory reading, this is how it&#x27;s done anyways). I&#x27;m using standard OpenSSL libraries - things that are vetted, and I&#x27;m using like they suggest. Rolling my own was using it without an IV and without message authentication (aka getting it half right). I&#x27;m not doing that any more.<p>Obviously the libraries he suggested are different than the ones I&#x27;m using, but that in itself shouldn&#x27;t be a case for dismissal. The ones I&#x27;m using are industry standard. His suggestion uses a different stream cipher and a different key generation scheme, the ciphers and key generation scheme I&#x27;m using are what are behind SSL/TLS - something which is not broken. The NSA didn&#x27;t break this, they bought their way through the crypto, which should tell you something about its strength.<p>I am generally curious though, to make sure I got what I did right. I think I have - and again the only part I&#x27;m not sure about entirely is message authentication. Some places online suggest including the IV in with the authentication. However, since the code is open to the public, and if an attacker were to take my database, they&#x27;d have the IV no problem. The only thing they wouldn&#x27;t have is what I&#x27;m signing each message with, the thing that really does the authentication, my server config variable only used for message auth.",1379987955

Or, say, almost anything from GNOME.</i><p>This doesn&#x27;t apply to embedded Linux, or Linux for servers, which could be argued to be just as &quot;traditional&quot; a use case as Linux for desktops.<p>Additionally, for the desktop use case, nearly every distribution uses a different window manager anyway. There are such a wide variety of window managers, I wouldn&#x27;t know how to compute an &quot;average&quot; between them in a meaningful way. Although I use Linux for a desktop everyday, I don&#x27;t have GNOME installed, and I would barely notice if X was missing and replaced by Wayland or a different component.<p>> <i>I think it&#x27;s misleading to read &quot;Linux&quot; and imagine &quot;desktop GNU/Linux with all the trimmings.&quot;</i><p>Right. It&#x27;s not Linux for the desktop, or Linux for the phone, or Linux for embedded devices, or Linux for servers, it&#x27;s Linux for the living room. My point is that due to the diversity of the Linux ecosystem, there really wasn&#x27;t such a thing as a &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;average&quot; Linux Desktop in the first place, and that we can&#x27;t even say Linux for desktop is the &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;average&quot; use of Linux.

6435400,comment,6435030,6435209,12,0,ds9,,,"You&#x27;re a little too harsh in saying &quot;tolerated&quot;.<p>Opinion polls have shown for decades that a majority favor a system more like those of Canada or Europe - here it&#x27;s called &quot;single payer&quot;. But the interests of the majority have little relevance here.<p>The &quot;single payer&quot; alternative is considered so radical in USA that it&#x27;s mentioned in the corporate media only apologetically, as if it were advocacy of leprosy. When they can&#x27;t avoid mentioning the obvious, the rejection of it is euphemistically explained by saying that it is &quot;politically unrealistic&quot; - before a quick change of topic. The &quot;talking points&quot; the owners provide for their followers call it &quot;socialism&quot;, and the latter, in US political culture, is an epithet like &quot;child molester&quot;.<p>The ugly reality this charade is designed to avoid acknowledging is that the US is ruled by what has lately been called &quot;the one percent&quot; - and <i>there is nothing the majority can do about it</i>. Voting for one of the practically identical, freak-show, major-party candidates is made useless by the two-party system; the increasingly hollow pretence of democracy mocks any thought of reform.<p>Of course it&#x27;s barbaric. It is also perfectly rational on the part of the rulers: their families need not worry about getting first-quality treatment of any health problem, and from their view the rest are disposable labor whose costs are still too expensive.<p>What, exactly, would you propose we do about it? Protest in the streets? People can&#x27;t afford to lose their jobs, nor even time away from their daily responsibilities. Write to Congresspeople? Pointless for those who can&#x27;t afford lobbyists. Revolution? No one has a realistic plan. It&#x27;s almost miraculous that Obama managed to (temporarily?) install a plan that even purports to help - and it forces citizens to pay the insurance industry, whose presence in the healthcare system is exactly what keeps 30-40 percent of the population an illness or injury away from destitution.<p>You&#x27;re obviously in a better place (news of which does not penetrate the info-tainment here, BTW), but it&#x27;s rather naive to suppose that we in the US chose this situation.

Still, I have yet to miss an air date.<p>Then I look at the amount of points remaining and choose an idea from the right-hand half of the table to work on. Sometimes there&#x27;s one I&#x27;m already working on--that goes into a special &quot;On Deck&quot; corner of the table--in which case I just generate story cards from that and slot them into the current iteration.

Hell, even in a single process, this kind of serial access results in the same situation. The point of a purely functional data structure is to be able to pass it to another method/thread/whatever, without having to worry that the data will be modified without the caller context expecting it..<p>In terms of the type of pattern you&#x27;re talking about (something like producer/consumer), an appropriate pattern in Scala might be to use an actor with an internal mutable data structure. Actors receive messages in a synchronized manner, and can then distribute work as needed. If the majority of your data is immutable, then beyond config for number of threads and actor mailbox size, there&#x27;s very little you need to worry about - contention, lock granularity and race conditions are essentially non-issues.<p>As a thought exercise, it would be possible to use an immutable queue with an actor for the above purpose. Create an actor that, when receiving a message containing an item to enqueue, waits until it receives a queue. When sent a message with a queue, it should take a message from the mailbox, enqueue it, then send the queue to a second actor. That actor will dequeue and operate on an item from its message, then send a message with the new queue (with one less item) to the original actor. The only time the original actor will do nothing is when it receives a message with an empty queue (which is how it will start, and also the state it will be in every time it has finished working its queue), in which case it will wait for an item to enqueue. Assuming that the &quot;process a queue item&quot; step is fast (as it should be), and the &quot;wait for a queue&quot; is not a busy wait (I think there is a way to do this with Akka), then this might actually be efficient. This is probably a bad idea though, just having fun thinking about how it would be possible. =)",1379986163

There are a TON of &quot;signalling&quot; devices, for example liking comic books, or having thick-rimmed glasses.  Now, I&#x27;m not a physicist (chemist/biologist) and we may be more &quot;down to earth&quot; but I don&#x27;t have a single scientist friend who HAS THE TIME to do a lot of those things that maybe in high school geeks/nerds did a lot of.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who plays D&D anymore, I don&#x27;t know anyone who goes to Comic-Con (I&#x27;m in San Diego).   We do stuff like - go hiking; I&#x27;m obsessed with social dance (where there are, incidentally, tons of engineers and scientists); I had a lot of math majors friends from college and of the ones that did math PhD programs, they wound up: climbing rediculous spires in red rock country, supermarathon running for fun...  And one, after getting his PhD, joined the Navy and entered its pilot training program (he would have become a fighter pilot but there were no fighter billets available).<p>So, what bugs me about BBT in addition to having really awful people (watch &quot;BBT without the laugh track&quot; on youtube if you doubt it), is not only that it perpetuates stereotypes, it perpetuates really dumb stereotypes...  And the life of a scientist, I think, swings from incredibly boring times in the lab, to super-exciting times in the lab, to &quot;relatively normal social life&quot; outside of the lab, except that that last one gets a lot less time, since, we&#x27;re in the lab all the damn time.",1379985664

Women in particular seem to be taught not to profit. In fact, I think on the other side of the equation it is part of what has been awkward for me. Many of my closest male friends see profit as part of their self-identity and it wasn&#x27;t until your post here that it clicked for me that it may be related to gender identity.<p>So, like I said, worth a lot. And making people feel good, caring for people, it&#x27;s the most valuable skill so far as I&#x27;m concerned. Glad there are other people who value it.",1379984717

The frequent correspondence between priority rollouts and marginal seats is just a coincidence.<p>Perhaps there&#x27;s a reason why it&#x27;s better to have a weird patchwork of rollouts, rather than progressing geometrically or geographically or according to the network topology or whatever.

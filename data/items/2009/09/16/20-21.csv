826807,comment,826163,826163,0,0,andreyf,,,"I should have expounded in original post, thanks for asking. There are many points, the one I'm thinking about in particular has to do with what <i>Lisp</i> is. I conced that Cojure is in the family of Lisp languages because it has the s-exp syntax and the macros.<p>However, it's a step back in The <i>Philosophy</i> of Lisp, because it doesn't allow user-defined reader macros. First let me explain what I see the philosophy of Lisp - it is the late-binding of all things. Late-binding, in this sense, means that the system by which you make the computer do the things you want it to (we usually call them ""languages"") makes as few decisions as possible, and lets the user overwrite and extend them. For example, the Python mailing list every once in awhile has an active debate if anaphoric `aif' should be allowed in the language [0]. This would mean adding a special symbol `it', such that:<p><pre><code>    aif expensive_function_call():\n       foo(it)\n</code></pre>\nis an equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    it = expensive_function_call()\n    if it:\n       foo(it)\n</code></pre>\nGvR decided against it, after weighing the needs of the Python community. The late-binding that I see as inherent in The Lisp Philosophy says that decisions like these are personal decisions to be made as late as possible (certainly <i>not</i> when you're designing a system of computational expression), and certainly not for all users. Each user should be able to <i>define</i> aif to mean whatever they feel it does. The current popular counter-argument is that this would shatter languages into a personal dialects that nobody but themselves and their best friend would understand. The Lisp family of languages disagrees, and hence, supports macros. Cojure, for this reason, supports macros [1].<p>However, there are two kinds of macros Lisp supports for the same reason: ""syntax macros"" which let you late-define how syntax is interpreted, and ""reader macros"", which let you define how the <i>parser</i> interprets your syntax (the Lisp parser is called the <i>reader</i>). For example, the <i>reader</i> of Clojure translates '(foo) into (quote foo), #{:x} into (hash-set :x), [x y z] into (vector x y z), etc.<p>However, the rules by which the <i>reader</i> translates those ""special"" deviations from normal s-expression syntax into s-expressions is closed off from modification. This goes against The Lisp Philosophy, and is not so in other Lisps [2]. The only case for this I've heard (in Stuart Halloway's ""Programming Clojure"") is that this would allow people to dilute the language into something which is no longer Clojure. This explicit early binding is a step back in what I see as the Philosophy of Lisp because brings us back to the religious tribalism of ""this is Clojure, and the language decisions that were made are good decisions, and if you don't like them go fuck yourself"".<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_%28linguistics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_%28linguistics%29</a><p>1. The analogy I like best here is to mathematics. Any mathematician can create his own definitions to explain his ideas (as they usually do), and yet, mathematics doesn't break up into dialects that nobody can understand. Instead, mathematical language evolves as people participate - if you have a pet definition you like (maybe one you thought up all on your own!) you don't need to convince Guido or some council of language makers to be able to use it. You use it, and if your paper is worth reading, maybe you can convince other people to accept it. That way, mathematics as a language <i>evolves</i>, not by design, but by social interaction. The formal languages of computation can (and should) do the same.<p>2. <a href=""http://www.psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/chapter03-12.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/chapter03-12.html</a>",1253134640

826775,comment,826343,826343,0,0,grosales,,,"I think you have a valid analogy of Lisp to Linux, but you you should finish the PG book before you make any final judgment. The power of Lisp comes from its ""simplicity"", its extensions, and the magical Aha moment you get while coding in Lisp (it's like obtaining zen only to realize new and bigger doors have opened before you and there is a vast ocean of new knowledge to gain) - the Aha moment is rather special, to the point that I don't know how to describe it, that's why you should try to have it yourself. Like other comments have mentioned, Scheme and CL have different purposes (Scheme is mostly used in academia and is very simplistic while CL was geared to enterprises mostly). I really don't know why Lisp flavor wars arise, I suppose is the price we pay for being among passionate people, it can hold back a technology for sure, but if that war can be turned into a logical debate of merits, great things can come out. On that note, I do like Windows 7 a lot, but I will stick to Linux because I have learned so much (shell scripting, network administration, socket programming) ever since I started using it that it's not even funny, and there is some fun in being able to fix something yourself instead of having to report a bug to MS and wait for them to fix it.",1253133967

You know, that thing your English teacher always bugged you to do because it would make your essays more coherent. If one insists on writing code before understanding the problem, this is probably one of the better ways to do it. Recognizing that function names are obviously correct because you know exactly what their purpose is in relation to the whole is a good sign.<p>When I first started programming I wrote a lot of code without much planning, and it was good because it allowed me to learn a language faster by interacting with it. When what should have been pretty straightforward programs started to get unwieldy, I realized that I had to do something different. Now I go at it with pencil and paper before writing any code, and I find it much more productive and fun because the level of understanding is better.<p>It's so easy to write code and it seems like it's so easy to change, but with any non-trivial problem I think that this is really an illusion. There are many times when it is useful to write exploratory code without much planning, but I think it's mostly useful for learning a new environment or banging out a minor variation of something you've done before. Otherwise it seems more useful to do some fairly systematic planning, even if it's for a prototype that may get completely reworked over a number of iterations where requirements are explored and may change.",1253132073

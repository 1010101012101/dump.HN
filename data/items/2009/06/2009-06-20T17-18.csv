Trying to get a decent explanation of why I should have my plumbing replaced rather than repaired from someone with poor localized language sounds skills sounds like a nightmare.<p>A better bet would be for, say, North Americans to operate remote repair devices for locations in North America (and likewise for other language-unified locales).<p>Perhaps a local, unskilled person operates a device to feed information back to a pool of technicians in some other location; you get the human element, but centralized technical smarts.<p>I believe something like that happens now with medical imaging.  Technicians run the scanning machines, send the images off to who-knows-where for skilled readers to interpret, the results are moderated by a more-skilled supervisor, and sent back to the lab or hospital.<p>Still, I get the feeling that fixing bikes is part engineering, part art, and transmitting sufficient information over the wire for remote viewing may a hard problem.  Like cooking, some things are just better handled by real live people.",1245520767
666615,comment,666407,666407,0,0,michael_nielsen,,,"I was a theoretical physicist for 13 years, and struggled a lot with this question.  I found it very useful to develop several different styles for reading mathematics and physics.  Mostly I did this in the context of reading papers, not books, but the comments below are easily adapted to books.<p>One unusual but very useful style was to set a goal like reading 15 papers in 3 hours. I use the term ""reading"" here in an unusual way.  Of course, I don't mean understanding everything in the papers.  Instead, I'd do something like this: for each paper, I had 12 minutes to read it.  The goal was to produce a 3-point written LaTeX summary of the most important material I could extract: usually questions, open problems, results, new techniques, or connections I hadn't seen previously.  When time was up, it was onto the next paper.  A week later, I'd make a revision pass over the material, typically it would take an hour or so.<p>I found this a great way of rapidly getting an overview of a field, understanding what was important, what was not, what the interesting questions were, and so on.  In particular, it really helped identify the most important papers, for a deeper read.<p>For deeper reads of important papers or sections of books I would take days, weeks or months.  Giving lectures about the material and writing LaTeX lecture notes helped a lot.<p>Other ideas I found useful:<p>- Often, when struggling with a book or paper, it's not you that's the problem, it's the author.  Finding another source can quickly clear stuff up.<p>- The more you make this a social activity, the better off you'll be.  I organize lecture courses, write notes, blog the notes, and so on.  E.g. <a href=""http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=252"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?p=252</a> (on Yang-Mills theories) and <a href=""http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?page_id=503"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/?page_id=503</a> (links to some of my notes on distributed computing).<p>- On being stuck: if you feel like you're learning things, keep doing whatever you're doing, but if you feel stuck, try another approach.  Early on, I'd sometimes get stuck on a book or a paper for a week.  It was only later that I realized that I mostly got stuck when either (a) it was an insubstantive point; or (b) the book was badly written; or (c) I was reading something written at the wrong level for me.  In any case, remaining stuck was rarely the right thing to do.<p>- Have a go at proving theorems / solving problems yourself, before reading the solution.  You'll learn a lot more.<p>- Most material isn't worth spending a lot of time on.  It's better to spend an hour each seriously reviewing 10 quantum texts, and finding one that's good, and will repay hundreds of hours of study, than it is to spend 10 hours ploughing through the first quantum text that looks okay when you browse through it in the library.  Understanding mathematics deeply takes a lot of time.  That means effort spent in identifying high quality material is often repaid far more than with (say) a novel or lighter non-fiction.",1245520682

666609,comment,665782,666031,0,0,something,,,"you want to avoid a bogey because it starts a vicious cycle.  assuming you are at par, a bogey requires a birdie just to get back to par.  going for that birdie risks another bogie that would require another birdie to balance, and so on.  playing in this highly volatile manner you run a higher risk of having to make great shots in order to end up with an average score.  it's more in your favor to wait until you make a great shot (say a great second shot on a par 4 that leaves you two feet from the hole) and then capitalize on the ""free"" consequence (the two foot birdie putt) that actually takes you above average than to be forced to sink a 50 foot birdie just to stay at average (because you missed par on the previous hole).",1245520369

It's only in the last 30 years that science books tend to just be collections of other people's papers rewritten for the lay audience.

I really feel, since I never see any real evidence, that these sort of claims are just self-serving.<p>Your example of the physics professor is fine, in that you actually provided an example, but I'm not sure that is a fair evaluation. I think his question is fairly reasonable. The field of physics is so large and the amount of knowledge and sophistication required in both mathematics and physics to actually ""discover laws of the universe"" that it would be very difficult to achieve such a level by simply independent study.<p>Sure, there people like Srinivasa Ramanujan but they are very, very rare. I think there is too much made about autodidactism. There are many autodidacts. However, how many autodidacts take their learning to such a rigorous degree? Now, compare that with how many people read a few books on physics and are very interested in it but never come close to that level of sophistication.<p>I just don't think we can say ""See, academics aren't even interested in learning about the World. They are glorified bureaucrats that can solve differential equations.""<p>I think that is a bridge too far.",1245519569
666597,comment,666559,666559,0,0,cturner,,,"This is timely - I wrote an ed guide today and this post is a good opportunity to share it. I've been working on a remote server via ILO-in-a-browser with broken console definitions and a screen that's too small for the interface. It's a gift - I've wanted to be fluent in ed for a long time and spent the time to get there today.<p>If anyone has something similar for console-mode sam usage I'd love to know that too.<p>Anyway - the guide:<p><pre><code>    Ed doesn't push any of the fancy cruft that modern
    editors do - full screen views of the text in question
    or fiddly mouse interfaces.
    
    It is line based, scriptable, it works *everywhere*
    that unix runs, and the default configuration is
    predictable. A true power tool from the days of yore
    when men were men and each tool did one simple thing
    extremely well.
    
    How to get into ed and create some text:
    <pre>
    $ touch my_filename
    $ ed my_filename
    0
    a
    Here is some text
    next line
    more
    yet more
    The dot on the next line indicates I'm done inserting text. Then save and exit.
    .
    w
    q
    $ 
    </pre>
    
    Basic commands:
    * a: append to the first line
    * p: print the current line
    * n: print the current line with a line number (handy)
    * %n: list all lines
    * 1n: list line one
    * 1,5n: line lines one to five
    * 5,$n: list lines five until the end
    * 2d: delete line two
    * 3,4j: merge lines 3 and 4
    * 2i: insert text to a new line before the current line 2
    * P: enable prompt
    * %l: - that's a lower-case letter after 'k' not the
      number one. Print all lines, including end-of-line
      markers (useful in dos2unix settings among others).
    
    Regular expressions (this is where it gets exciting):
    * 2s/next/another/: change the word 'next' on line
      two do 'another' (don't forget that trailing slash)
    * g/e/: find all the lines containing the letter 'e'
    * g/e/n: find all the lines containing the letter 'e'
      and then print them out with their line number next
      to them.
    * %s/e/q/: change the first instance of the letter 'e'
      to 'q' on all lines
    * %s/e/q/g: change all instances of the letter 'e' to
      'q' on all lines
    * 1,5s/e/q/3: change the third instance of the letter
      'e' to 'q' on all lines
    * %v/for/n: print out the lines that do NOT contain
      the word 'for'
    
    Other magic:
    * 1,4y: cut ('yank') lines 1 to 4
    * 5x: paste to after line 5
    * 1,3t6: Transfers lines one to three to a position
      after line 6.</code></pre>",1245519559

The modern academic world -- at least in CS -- seems largely to consist of producing as many papers as you can, putting forth unimportant results, so as to get more 'points' and another funded project and more students. (British universities really are assessed on published papers, with different weightings accorded to international conferences and journals. It's a game.)<p>To do anything interesting means reducing or delaying your paper output (which your supervisor will not appreciate), and to get the results published requires you to write so as to persuade people with no vested interest in publishing novel output to agree with you... but without being able to have a dialogue.<p>I recall one amusing paper review by three reviewers which was essentially<p>1. ""the treatment of X is great, but I'd like to see more Y"",
2. ""too much Y, not enough X"",
3. ""both X and Y are fine, but I'd have been really interested in seeing Z instead"", where Z was entirely unrelated.<p>How on earth could an author anticipate the preferences of those authors and get three recommendations? Well, picking a non-controversial subject would be a good start.<p>Multiply this anecdote up to the size of the academic and industrial systems, and it's no wonder that so many people decide that academia is not for them. These people tend to be lumped in with the people ""not cut out for it"", but I think a significant percentage simply realize that academia has a different value system, and don't want to participate.

In eight or so years, with extensive help from the faculty of two universities, I grew to understand the contents of several dozen thick hard science and math books, and for my efforts they gave me two degrees.<p>Since quitting school I've dragged myself through a small pile of classic CS texts, and have learned a ton (and, as a side effect, become nicely employable as a programmer).  It is insanely hard (and rewarding) work.  If it's hard, then you're learning something; keep it up!",1245518116

It's also helpful to monitor exactly what happens when you get spikes of anxiety; note the situation, your previous state, and any other details you can, even if you don't think they're pertinent. The more data you can obtain, the easier it will be to identify your ailment, chronic or not.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder</a>",1245518001

There are diminishing returns, however, and at some point you have to say, okay, that's enough, let's put some money into education instead.<p>You have to find some kind of balance, and the more you put in education the fewer lives you can save in hospitals. The only sensible way (I can think of) to find the right balance is by crunching the numbers. Saving a life for $1000? That's only 20 text books, definitely a good deal. Saving a life for a million? That's 20 scholarships. A life isn't worth that much.<p>Unless you're Steve.",1245517989

C, C++, SQL, Unix etc. has been around for some time. Java and .Net aren't going to go away anytime soon. We may yet see some disruptive changes in Web development, but I doubt whether the basic Javascript/HTML/CSS scheme, or PHP/Python/Ruby set will become obsolete anytime soon.<p>My plan is to ensure that I can always deliver valuable software and maybe even create some that I can own. A lot of my friends are doing their MBAs - I just don't think that route is for me.",1245517882

88676,comment,88370,88668,0,0,neilc,,,"Well, perhaps for the ""typical"" student, sure -- but by most metrics I would say the YC news audience is atypical. If you have a small amount of natural ability coupled with a work ethic, it is not a matter of getting As <i>or</i> having ""something of a social life"" -- you can have both.",1197452982
88675,comment,88457,88506,0,0,asdflkj,,,">I'm certain there is life places other than Earth,<p>Any evidence for that?<p>Edit: this is my pet peeve, and I'm still peeved, so I'll write some more. Nobody has any idea how probable the appearance of life is. Nobody even has an idea how it happened. The only thing we do know about that probability is that it's very low, since we haven't been able to observe life anywhere. Just how low is anyone's guess. It could be 1/(number of particles in the universe * googolplex). Or it could be much lower still.<p>My other pet peeve is singularity. If you show an 19th century man our world and give him the definition of singularity, he'll tell you it already happened. That's because it's totally meaningless, and essentially amounts to this: ""singularity is when technological progress goes so fast, that, like, dude, totally"".<p>There, now I feel better.",1197452813

88668,comment,88370,88418,0,0,imsteve,,,"For the typical student, I'd say they're far better off having something of a social life than chasing after straight A's.",1197451427
88667,comment,88370,88585,0,0,imsteve,,,"> People see this issue as black and white, but trying to get A's does not preclude you from doing other things. <p>I believe that it does. A small number of people, in general, make good use of the extra time afforded by slacking on grades, but we here on yc news probably aren't talking about the average person.<p>People I know who got straight A's were very one-minded. The huge number of clubs that they were in fools no one. Straight A's is almost a guarantee that the person has expertise in nothing else substantial, from what I've seen.",1197451315

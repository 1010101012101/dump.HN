9491974,comment,9487633,9487633,0,0,halflings,,,"<p><pre><code>    Once you have access to random 2D data, it’s pretty straight forward to convert that noise into usable data. Simply set up thresholds for each tile type you want to support, eg:
     
    * water if < 0.3
    * grass if >= 0.3 and <= 0.6
    * mountain if > 0.6
     
    I recommend leaving the upper and lower cases open. If they are not left open, you may end up with holes in your map for unexpectedly high or low values. An alternative is to clamp or scale the noise values when you generate them.
</code></pre>
If you expect to have more tile types, you should probably consider a categorical probability distribution (something like: water: 0.3, grass: 0.3, mountain: 0.4) and sample from it (instead of &quot;hard-coding&quot; it with the test you&#x27;re referring to)",1430827090

You obviously have much more practical experience with this kind of system.<p>Many of the problems you mentioned I am aware of, and also have no workable solution yet (detecting lost messages being the biggest - Merkle-tees sounds like a very interesting approach, maybe even applied at the log-level?).<p>As mentioned in another reply, Kafka does support the kind of &quot;pointer-to-log&quot; setup you mention. Also Kafka is designed for lots of consumers, each with different characteristics. In principle, I should be able to sync something like memcache with the same information I need to sync Elasticsearch. The same holds for a websocket-server that reads from this stream and forwards new events to web-app clients. So I don&#x27;t see the need for more than one &quot;queue&quot; yet, maybe that will show up in practice.<p>Also your setup would require a lot more coordination to handle updates from multiple postgres instances, if I understood correctly.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m still in the experimental phase with all of this, I will publish a writeup once I gain a bit more experience.",1430826013

If you actually do feel bad about it, then I sincerely retract the tone of my response, and apologize for my poor interpretation.<p>Regarding &quot;make science more interesting in school&quot;, that seems to be a shift in conversation. My comment was in regards to feeling &quot;short-changed about your previous education and stupid about all the new stuff you have to absorb&quot;.<p>In the context of making &quot;science more interesting in school&quot; you wrote:<p>> Not talking about the existence of things when trying to introduce a field really stifles curiosity, by obscuring the fact that that there are many interesting avenues of inquiry that have yet to be explored.<p>This is incomplete. Many of the things we have brought up, from DNA methylation to obscure reef geography, are well explored. Your comment imply that only the globally unexplored is interesting to students, which simply isn&#x27;t true. The issue is that it is not reasonable for all teachers to know all of the details about these topics, and be able to summarize them, in such a way that no student will ever feel that they have been slighted for being misinformed about a detail.<p>A great way to make science more interesting in school is to not cover all of the details and only hit the highlights. This coveys the main idea which is that these fields are comprehensible.<p>If instead teachers spend much of their time qualifying their statements, then most students will be overwhelmed with information. &quot;Will this be on the test?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;So why do we need to know it?&quot; &quot;Because it&#x27;s good for you.&quot;<p>Call this the &quot;Now eat your vegetables.&quot; or &quot;It builds character&quot; approach to teaching.

This doesn&#x27;t just have a cost to it financially, but also environmentally.<p>It also means that if you want your batteries to last, you can reduce your depth of charge by purchasing excessive capacity. This way instead of discharging 100% of X capacity, you can discharge 50% of 2X capacity, and this lower discharge depth makes the battery last longer. Which means you tend to have to buy a lot more capacity than li-ion.<p>Beyond that, look at it like any system. e.g. do you want 4 small fridges that give you x liters of volume, or one large fridge that gives you 4x liters of volume for a slightly higher price? Do you want 10 harddrives that give you 100gb each for $250, or would you buy a $300 1 TB drive?<p>There are non-financial reasons to go for simplicity, something that works out the box, plug and play.

9491834,comment,9491365,9491518,0,0,rbehrends,,,"I see this less as corruption at the top myself and more as a number of internal problems systemic to the BND and the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Germany&#x27;s domestic intelligence service).<p>I am old enough to have seen a huge number of scandals coming out of the German intelligence services. I&#x27;ve seen Maihofer resign over the Traube affair and I&#x27;ve seen German intelligence snoop on privileged client-attorney communications and a lot of other bad stuff. The list of BND scandals is legion.<p>I would be happy to see resignations of any current and former Chief of the Chancellery involved in these schemes, pour décourager les autres. Let&#x27;s be clear: the BND has pretty much intentionally broken several of the safeguards contained in the G10 Act, often with internal legal justifications that don&#x27;t pass the giggle test (and would make only John Yoo proud). And the most recent revelations may mean they even committed crimes (conduction espionage for a foreign power, per §99 of the penal code, and economic espionage, per §17 of the law against unfair competition). This is plenty of reason for heads to roll. And sometimes, the tree of liberty has to be watered with the careers of intelligence service bureaucrats.<p>At the same time, even as an anti-fan of Angela Merkel&#x27;s policies, I don&#x27;t see what kicking her out of office would help (unless she had her fingers deeply in this particular pie). Intelligence services regular seem to aim at becoming a state within a state, and dismantling the power structures above them won&#x27;t help; structuring safeguards so that they aren&#x27;t as easily circumvented does. For example, in theory, the G10 commission (the watchdog appointed by the Bundestag) has broad control over what the intelligence services can do in terms of surveillance and can stop any and all surveillance measures at any time. In practice, however, that seems to have been circumvented by them not being told in the first place (or being deceived).",1430823870

Experience in the law-making process, knowing the ropes of the political system and maintaining diplomatic standards: That&#x27;s what members of lower ranks of political administration should be for (which for this very reason usually are appointed instead of elected). Politicians in leadership positions should be measured by their vision (or plan, to use a less high-flying term) for the country and integrity alone. Instead, most politicians in modern democracies have learned to navigate the political system and the media circus exceptionally well while integrity and ethics have been left behind.<p>Talking about political experience: Before Merkel became chancellor she was very inexperienced in international politics herself. As was Helmut Kohl, who was often underestimated by fellow state leaders (notably Margaret Thatcher) for his uncouth appearance and his perceived intellectual shortcomings. Both grew while in office with Kohl even managing the diplomatic masterpiece of the German reunion against all odds.<p>What&#x27;s happening right now is just outrageous. German intelligence spying on German citizens and companies and selling that data to a supposed ally who in turn uses this data against Germany. Everybody responsible for this (including the chancellor) should step down and make way for a government that&#x27;s willing to represent the interests of the people again instead of furthering their own agenda or catering for the interests of another country.",1430823652

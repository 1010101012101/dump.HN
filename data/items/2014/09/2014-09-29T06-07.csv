8381922,comment,8374345,8374713,1,0,balor123,,,"Tempting but extra levels of indentation also lead to poor readability. The other problem is that this style of programming isn&#x27;t commonplace and will throw off new readers. Better to just stick to a standard program, broken up into pseudocode I think. Technically, the bind time of variables are still the entire function but in practice you can choose to limit the useful scope of a variable to the code block where it is defined. It doesn&#x27;t take a master coder to notice quickly that the first variable at the top is the one to remember going down the lines. The only remaining problems, then, are that variable names become a little longer to avoid conflicts between the code blocks and the compiler probably won&#x27;t be able to optimize the function as well as you&#x27;d like to, since some extra variables stick around for longer when not needed.",1411973817

It is too specific of a definition to be truly useful.<p>I hope you realise that your use cases for words isn&#x27;t the same as every other English-speaker&#x27;s.<p>> I find it much more convenient, and useful, to have a word that means the current modern definition of decimate.<p>The word you&#x27;re looking for, as mentioned, is devastate.  Perhaps ruin, destroy, wreck, ravage, desolate, demolish, raze, etc.  If you&#x27;re happy with a phrase rather than a single word there&#x27;s plenty more to choose from to convey your desired meaning.<p>> Perhaps decimate is a poor choice to represent that, but honestly not every word has to sound or have roots that directly relate to the definition of the word.<p>Agreed, but where words have a specific use (even if not to you) it&#x27;s frustrating to have their meaning modified to a concept that is more than adequately conveyed by dozens of other, existing, commonly used words.<p>That&#x27;s my point.<p>> It is more important words are used, rather than languish or die in history books.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what to make of that claim.",1411973100

So why did my colleague feel compelled to pile up the polysyllables?<p>This reminds me of something from &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;. Feynman was attending some kind of interdisciplinary conference, and says:<p>------- begin quote -------<p>There was a sociologist who had written a paper for us all to read – something he had written ahead of time. I started to read the damn thing, and my eyes were coming out: I couldn’t make head nor tail of it! I figured it was because I hadn’t read any of the books on that list. I have this uneasy feeling of “I’m not adequate,” until finally I said to myself, “I’m gonna stop, and read one sentence slowly, so I can figure out what the hell it means.”<p>So I stopped – at random – and read the next sentence very carefully. I can’t remember it precisely, but it was very close to this: “The individual member of the social community often receives his information via visual, symbolic channels.” I went back and forth over it, and translated. You know what it means? “People read.”<p>------- end quote -------<p>Feynman wasn&#x27;t the only one who could not understand what others were saying:<p>------- begin quote -------<p>There was only one thing that happened at that meeting that was pleasant or amusing. At this conference, every word that every guy said at the plenary session was so important that they had a stenotypist there, typing every Goddamn thing. Somewhere on the second day the stenotypist came up to me and said, “What profession are you? Surely not a professor.”<p>“I am a professor,” I said.<p>“Of what?”<p>“Of physics – science.”<p>“Oh! That must be the reason,” he said.<p>“Reason for what?”<p>He said, “You see, I’m a stenotypist, and I type everything that is said here. Now, when the other fellas talk, I type what they say, but I don’t understand what they’re saying.

That is to say, the search is still fast but sorting a large resultset can be slow.<p>The only gotchas I would call out to anyone thinking of using PostgreSQL full text search are:<p>1) Beware of row-level queries like ts_highlight() for extracting a fragment of the matched text, be sure that you are only doing this for the n lines that you are returning for a LIMIT and not the entire resultset (most of which you will discard).<p>2) Beware of accuracy and think about the text you are indexing. If you are receiving raw markdown and transforming to HTML, then you shouldn&#x27;t index either (raw markdown may contain XSS attacks that can survive ts_highlight(), and the transformed HTML will contain markup that will be indexed). You should figure out a way to build a block of raw text that is safe to index <i>and</i> to show fragments for (ts_highlight()) which likely means running a striptags() over the HTML and also putting hyperlinks into the text (if you want those to be searchable) and indexing that.<p>We had no issues with performance, control over search ordering, or anything else. The only gotchas we encountered related to sorting and displaying results, and we resolved both easily enough, though too few of the high-level docs like the linked article pointed out the potential issues there.",1411971416

No chance to ever also looking it up in the dictionary.<p>Changing this requires changing the C code and subsequently deploying your custom module, all of which is certainly doable but also additional work you might not want to have to do.<p>And finally: If you use a dictionary, keep in mind that it&#x27;s by default not shared between connections. That means that you have to pay the price of loading that dictionary whenever you use the text search engine the first time over a connection.<p>For smaller dictionaries, this isn&#x27;t significant, but due to the compound handling in ispell, you&#x27;ll have huge-ass(tm) dictionaries. Case in point is ours which is about 25 Megs in size and costs 0.5 seconds of load time on an 8 drive 15K RAID10 array.<p>In practice (i.e. whenever you want to respond to a search in less than 0.5 secs, which is, I would argue, always), this forces you to either use some kind of connection pooling (which can have other side-effects for your application), or you use the shared_ispell extension (<a href=""http://pgxn.org/dist/shared_ispell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pgxn.org/dist/shared_ispell</a>), though I&#x27;ve seen crashes in production when using that which led me to go back to pgbouncer.<p>Aside of these limitations (neither of which will apply to you if you have an english body, because searching these works without a dictionary to begin with), yes, it works great.<p>(edited: Added a note about chaining dictionary modules)",1411970690

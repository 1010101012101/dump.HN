938104,comment,937430,937932,0,0,Freebytes,,,"That is certainly the reason he was downvoted.  Is there really any reason to discuss downvoting?  The fact that his wife might not want him to take such drastic steps is actually a good thing.  My wife is my dream killer which is a good thing.  Dreams are fantasies.  You should be willing to 'go for it', but you should have someone there to keep you in reality.  Just because his wife might not see things from his perspective does not mean she is wrong.  Instead of seeing it in such a negative light, it should instead encourage him to find more information to persuade her.  She, after all, is more like the customer than he will ever be, and the customer is the target for your business venture.  If you can convince her of the project, that is probably a useful project.  I am sure she would not mind a small cut in hours to work on a side business.  Even going from 40 hours to 35 hours per week at such a job would be a big change.  That extra 5 hours per week could result in him eagerly awaiting to come home to continue working on his projects.  He is not asking for permission to be lazy, and his wife would not be asking for him to suffer.  Instead, she would be the voice of reason to prevent him from slipping into fantasies.  She might say no at first but agree to a large cut of hours (40 to 20 perhaps) if he saves six months of income.  That would give him something towards which he can work.  He can bargain this way until they reach a concensus.  The reason he wants fewer hours at work is to spend more time with his family not to leave his family.  Even something as small as ""I am going to stay up 2 hours later than usual each night to work on my projects and work for 8 hours on Saturday on it."" can be the beginning of a new business.  That would equate to 18 hours per week of working on the side project, and when you can show something for the time spent, she will probably be more accepting.  If she is initially accepting of everything you say, it does not mean she does not love him, and it does not mean she is a cruel woman.  It simply means that she wants what is best for the family, and she can be the rational one that keeps him grounded.  He can continue to dream, but he needs a solution for filtering his ideas, and she can be perfect for that.",1258044807

What we've tried to do with Windows 7 whether it's traditional format or in a touch format is create a Mac look and feel in terms of graphics. We've significantly improved the graphical user interface, but it's built on that very stable core Vista technology, which is far more stable than the current Mac platform, for instance.<p>Interviewer: So you've taken the style of the Mac platform and built it on the more solid foundations of Vista?<p>We've taken everything that's good about Vista, along with the core infrastructure of the operating system, and we've made it faster and slimmed down the code to make it more effective.<p>We've also tried to listen to what customers want in terms of a much slicker user interface and the ability to engage with it far more intuitively.

The transmitter has to have a model of the receiver, and then devise the data that will transform the receiver according to the intent of the transmitter.<p>For example, if you're a mathematician and I talk about the topological space obtained by gluing the edge of a mobious strip to the edge of a disk being the same topological space obtained by identifying antipodal points of S^2, you'll know what I mean.  If not, I have to explain further.<p>Similarly, a computer program can start with a top level description of your intent, and a competent programmer can then complete the steps.<p>But a computer is not a programmer.  When you describe your algorithm in sufficient detail for a programmer, you haven't given enough information for someone who isn't a programmer.  A non-programmer will look at what you've written and then say ""How do I do that?""  Thus you need further instructions.<p>So you might say ""We sort this vector of numbers by picking one at random, scanning down the vector to separate into those that are smaller, equal and larger, then recurse.""  and a sufficiently skilled programmer who's never met the Quicksort can now implement it.<p>But there are details missing.<p>You programs should (perhaps) be arranged so that the main routine is sufficient for a very skilled programmer to complete. Each routine called then is sufficient for a slightly less skilled programmer to complete, and recurse.<p>The problem is that the terminating case is the computer, and not a programmer, or even a person.  Thus the terminating case is a long way down.<p>Perhaps there is a language design that will bring the terminating case higher.",1258043295

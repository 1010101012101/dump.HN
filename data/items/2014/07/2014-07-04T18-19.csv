Contrary to overwhelming popular opinion, there are content protection schemes that work. Generalist engineers mistakenly believe that content protection schemes must be unbreakable to provide value. They don&#x27;t: all they have to do is cost more to break than the value of the content they protect (across all the users who might subsequently get access to it).<p>For an example of a content protection scheme that worked extremely well, see modern satellite TV smart cards.<p>Given that there are ways to implement content protection soundly, there&#x27;s validity to research that determines whether a given content protection scheme is sound.",1404500208

7989848,comment,7989259,7989259,9,0,rdl,,,"I&#x27;ll probably donate to this in a few hours, but to understand it more fully, what is the argument <i>against</i> getting PACs/money out of politics?<p>(Clearly there&#x27;s a simple argument against MayDay PAC itself, that it might be unsuccessful in its mission, but that&#x27;s a much weaker argument.)<p>As far as I understand it, there are four main arguments for money in politics:<p>1) Money is speech; protecting free speech is important, and protecting political speech (and thus financial donations to campaigns) is probably the most important form of protected speech.<p>2) The utilitarian argument: if money is taken out of politics, groups with less economic power but greater organization and numbers will become dominant.  (I&#x27;m not sold on pure democracy either).  Control of &quot;large audiences&quot; without control of money to reach the public might become important; I&#x27;d rather live in a world where I can donate hundreds or thousands to EFF to influence policy vs. a world where Pat Robertson or Oprah are the only people who can influence voters.<p>3) The implementation argument: if this eliminates a fairly accessible form of financing (the PAC), those who control smaller but more enduring forms of money for political contribution will rise in power.  IMO, those people tend to be much more objectionable than people who contribute to PACs.  Or, if companies are kept out of politics, but unions are allowed to continue donating, etc.<p>4) Priorities: this might NOT be the most important issue right now.  Maybe immigration is.  Maybe not going to war in Iran is.  etc.<p>I don&#x27;t know how valid these arguments are.",1404500120
7989845,comment,7987805,7988590,2,0,adamlett,,,"> maybe I just write my code in a weird way that insulates me from those things<p>Maybe you do. I certainly strive to. But don&#x27;t you sometimes have to work with other people&#x27;s code too? I recently inherited a 10 years old codebase written by people who had not heard of implied global and didn&#x27;t use the var keyword.<p>In my previous job I had to educate several frontend developers about the dangers of using parseInt without a radix parameter. The ones that already knew did so because… you&#x27;ve guessed it: They had previously gotten burned.<p>I worked on a project in which the backend had a rest API that served json data. Among the data were some rather long integer IDs. But since javascript doesn&#x27;t have integers but only floats (of all things), the IDs got rounded off in weird ways. Not very useful as IDs after that! If all everyone ever used was javascript, this would perhaps not have surprised anyone, and it would be known by all that you shouldn&#x27;t use a Number as an ID, but always only Strings. The problem is that most back-end developers are not Javascript experts and in their world it is only natural that you should be able to use a number as an ID (as it should be IMO).<p>As time goes by and you get experienced, you begin to learn all of these little &#x27;quirks&#x27; of the language, and maybe you start to adopt a defensive style of programming that insulates you from the worst of them. And if you&#x27;ve never experienced anything else, it&#x27;s easy to tell yourself that this is just the way things are, and that it&#x27;s probably the same for everyone. But I&#x27;m here to tell you, that this is not the case! Sure, other (better) languages have surprising behaviours too, but they are mostly good surprises that empower instead of restrict.",1404500079

7989808,comment,7988738,7989219,23,0,YZF,,,"> You can write very fast C++, if you spend a lot tweaking it and hire experience and extremely expensive ($300k/year and up) programmers, but typical C++ isn&#x27;t any faster than well-written code in other languages.<p>I disagree and so does Andrei Alexandrescu:<p>&quot;The going word at Facebook is that &#x27;reasonably written C++ code just runs fast,&#x27; which underscores the enormous effort spent at optimizing PHP and Java code. Paradoxically, C++ code is more difficult to write than in other languages, but efficient code is a lot easier [to write in C++ than in other languages].&quot; – Herb Sutter at //build/, quoting Andrei Alexandrescu<p>Here&#x27;s the thing about performance.  Sometimes you care and sometimes you don&#x27;t care.  When you don&#x27;t care- you don&#x27;t care.  You can write it in Python and even though it runs 10000 times slower, you still don&#x27;t care.  When you do care a factor of 10000 for Python vs. C++ or a factor of 3-5 (or more) of JVM languages vs. C++ can mean running 5 million servers instead of 1 million servers, or 10 frames per second vs. 60 frames per second, and the success or failure of your business.  This is why pretty much all the big players who care about performance use C++ (from games to web at scale).  The maintainability of large C++ projects is pretty much field proven and C++ is also evolving and while not quite fixing some of the causes for grief (because it maintains backwards compatibility) it offers new ways of doing things that are safer, more maintainable, and just as fast.<p>The only thing you said that I can slightly identify with is that you need good people in order to build things in C++ (and no, they don&#x27;t cost $300k/year.  I wish.)  This is not a con, this is a pro.  You want that regardless of language and good people will be expensive.  Yes, you can get cheap people to write bad code in any language.<p>EDIT: Another data point.  I worked on a huge Python project where performance did turn out to be an issue and it was virtually impossible to find a &quot;critical&quot; part to apply C++ to.  It was just slow throughout, it was built over a huge base of meta-programming and Python specific magic.  There was simply no single piece you could point to that if written in C++ would make it go significantly faster.  My point there is that while it&#x27;s certainly possible in a well designed system to mix languages while applying fast languages to performance critical portions it&#x27;s not always possible after the fact.  Language choice is an engineering decision and there&#x27;s no single answer but you have to be very careful with the attitude of just throwing something together in the mistaken hope that it can be fixed later.<p>EDIT2: I could say more to defend C++&#x27;s &quot;honour&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t need me as a champion...  The choice of programming languages though is important and we need a way to eliminate some of the FUD.  Part of that is through sharing real world successes and failures.  Naturally there is some cognitive dissonance happening, that is if I chose language X, therefore I&#x27;m smart, therefore language X is the best, therefore other people who chose language Y don&#x27;t have a clue.  Where this turns from religion to data is when we can say share data about the project N years later that is somehow comparable to other projects and people can try to gather some insight from that data.  The nice thing about performance is that it has an objective component to it, that is if we look at a certain problem we can get some numbers that we can compare.  It&#x27;s quantifiable.  Factors such as development time, maintainability etc. are less quantifiable.  Developer salaries, while quantifiable, are also hard to compare but are definitely a factor in making language decisions.",1404499412

Please stop talking.<p>Native toolkits are usually easier to dev once you know them.<p>It&#x27;s a conventional wisdom - at least one other person in this thread seems to agree with me on this.",1404496948

7989667,comment,7974203,7974203,1,0,JorgeJetson,,,"There are many similarities between the old laws prohibiting homosexuality and laws prohibiting prostitution.  both concern sexual behavior that are seen, by some, as sexual deviance.  Men are more likely than women to be concerned with homosexuality.  Whereas women are more likely than men to be concerned with prostitution.<p>In both cases what drives the classification as illegality is icky-ness.  A heterosexual male cannot imagine having sex with another man - it is just icky for him.  Similar, a woman wanting a monogamous relationship, with romance, sees prostitution as disgusting and just plain icky.<p>Most women cannot understand why any woman would become a prostitute.  So they imagine that there must be some awful reason: human trafficking, dominance by a male (pimp), etc.  For some prostitutes this is the case, but there are a vast number of women who practice prostitution and it is not.<p>For these women selling sex is not icky - they explain it as being uplifting since it provides a high level of financial security.  They actually find it difficult to understand why other women take issue with it.  Their sexuality may be different.  I understand that bisexual women have a more male like sex drive and I bet there are higher percentage of bisexuals in prostitution than in the general population.  Also lesbians may be over represented in prostitution - the dildo just has a guy attached to it that pays the rent.<p>So I propose here that the laws against prostitution are driven by perceived icky-ness (a form of sexual bigotry) as the laws against homosexuality.",1404496878

569339,comment,568668,568734,0,0,Confusion,,,"The fourth commenter at the blog makes an excellent point: people call it 'best practices', but they are actually 'common practices'.  The reason something is a common practice, is because it has been shown to work or, lacking measurements to proove that something works, because it  makes sense and 'just works'.<p>Moreover, it's just a non-sequitur to conclude from 'mediocre company X does Y' that 'doing Y makes a company mediocre'. What makes a company mediocre is in the things they cannot single out in clear statements of the form 'we should change practice Z, as it is not good.",1240141441

Amazon seems very expensive, Google App Engine and Heroku are too limited (though Heroku is really cool for basic Rails). Just hosting vServers somewhere would probably be OK, though I am not much of an admin.",1240141056

569336,comment,568738,569172,0,0,josefresco,,,"Contracts are useless when shit actually hits the fan, as anyone with motivation and a decent lawyer can wriggle out of them fairly easy.  Contracts are a deterrent, and something you can use to keep a client or web provider in line.  Sort of like a business nuclear bomb.<p>And if you're a small guy, either keep your contracts small and simple or don't use them at all.  Small biz owners are weary of signing anything and typically work better over a handshake and your word.",1240140670
569335,comment,568987,569262,0,0,yters,,,"FYI, objective morality doesn't require knowledge of moral axioms for people to observe particular instances of morally objective facts.  Just as we don't need to know quantum physics to observe physical facts.<p>Anyways, if morality isn't objective, why get offended when someone insists that it is?  He isn't doing anything immoral...",1240140444

That may happen if we destroy ourselves, or if we reach a peak of technological achievement such that we are effectively gods.<p>I hope the former won't happen in my lifetime, and I suspect we'll have to wait a while for the latter.",1240139813

Reality isn't consensus based.<p>Plus, disagreeing that morality is objective is incoherent.    If it isn't objective, then what's wrong with stating that it is objective?",1240139243

3337868,comment,3337482,3337855,3,0,crgt,,,"Copy & Paste:<p>""With some funding from Google and the U.S. Energy Department, a pair of computer scientists at Dartmouth University are updating the venerable grep and diff Unix command line utilities to handle more complex types of data.\nSuch updates are needed because ""we now tend to have more model-based configuration languages that have meaningful constructs spanning more than one line,"" said Gabriel Weaver, a Dartmouth graduate student who, along with Dartmouth computer science professor Sean Smith, is creating the variants of grep and diff. Weaver presented the new utilities at a poster session at the Usenix Large Installation System Administration (LISA) conference, being held this week in Boston.\nThe new programs will allow administrators to extract meaningful data from configuration files, log files and other sources of operational data, the researchers maintain.\nGrep and diff are command line-based text analysis tools available in all Linux and Unix distributions. Both are designed to parse documents on a line-by-line basis. Grep offers the ability to search through multiple text files and folders for a specific chunk of text or regular expression. Diff compares two documents and highlights the differences between them.\nAs with most Unix utilities, the output from either of these programs can be linked, or piped, to other utilities, so they can be incorporated into scripts that automate routine system administration tasks.\nThe new programs, called Context-Free Grep and Hierarchical Diff, will provide the ability to parse blocks of data rather than single lines. For each new type of data structure, a vendor would provide a pattern library identifying the basic structure of the data, which the software would then use to ""extract the constructs of interest from the document,"" Weaver said.\nSuch utilities could provide administrators the ability to work with more complex forms of data now being generated by network equipment and infrastructure software. For instance, Cisco's IOS (Internetwork Operating System), which is the company's operating system for its routers and switches, will provide operational data in block-like data structures.\nWith this data, a tool such as diff ""can be too low-level,"" Weaver said. ""Diff doesn't really pay attention to the structure of the language you are trying to tell differences between."" He has seen cases where dif reports that 10 changes have been made to a file, when in fact only two changes have been made, and the remaining data has simply been shifted around.\nGrep has issues with data blocks as well. ""With regular expressions, you don't really have the ability to extract things that are nested arbitrarily deep,"" Weaver said.\nContext-Free Grep is still in the design stage, but should be completed within the next few months. A prototype of Hierarchical Diff has been completed, though the researchers have not posted the code yet.<p>Google's interest in this technology springs from the company's efforts in cloud computing, where it must automate operations across a wide range of networking gear, Weaver said. The DOE foresees that this sort of software could play a vital role in smart grids, in which millions of energy consuming end-devices would have connectivity of some sort. The software would help ""make sense of all the log files and the configurations of the power control networks,"" Weaver said.\nIn addition to system administration duties, the utilities could also be used in with non-technical languages as well. They could be used to parse legal documents, for instance, Weaver suggested.\nA number of Usenix attendees praised the idea for its potential usefulness. ""You wonder why it hasn't been done before,"" one said. Another commented that such tools could also be really handy for code repositories such as Git.""<p>Joab Jackson covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.

3337865,comment,3332357,3334728,2,0,podperson,,,"Thanks for your reply.<p>I haven't used Android (aside from on my Kindle Fire) enough to form an educated position on it. The Kindle Fire's UI is both (a) gratuitously animated and (b) laggy, but I tend to assume that if the UI were more utilitarian it would be less laggy. If this is not the case, then Android is simply broken.<p>It still seems to me that there are different routes to implementing UI elements in Android and some work better than others. E.g. some aspects of the Kindle Fire's UI are consistently inconsistent as it were, while others seem to be perfectly solid. If I were in charge of Android I would focus on getting the basics right and forget about the eye candy. It's not that Android can _never_ compete with iOS (or whatever) in the eye candy department, but that you should crawl before you walk etc.<p>My impression of Linux from my various encounters with it (including trying to live with Ubuntu as my primary OS for a couple of months) is that it fails both as a utilitarian OS and an aesthetically pleasing one. (And yes, I'm sure there are plenty of suggestions for alternate UI systems from KDE to flux box that will somehow not have whatever issue I find.)",1323535678

3337785,comment,3335603,3337170,2,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Yes, the Fed did 'quantitative easing' which is obscure nonsense for they printed some money and gave it to the banks.  The bank stockholders should thank the Fed.  Actually the taxpayers should own the banks and slowly sell them back to private investors as the economy recovers.<p>When Greenspan did such money printing, he called it ""rebuilding the balance sheets"".<p>A 'secret' is that the large banks are creatures of the Fed.  They just are.<p>Yes, it might be more fair to the taxpayers, who really gave the money to the banks, and who are BACKING the banks, to have the banks be so tightly regulated that they are ""boring"" with little chance of going bust or of putting people in the ""1%"".  So, for the risky stuff, let hedge funds like MF Global, LTCM, etc. do that.  And break up the big banks so that if one fails it won't bring down the whole economy.  But these changes are too hot politically.<p>I doubt that the Fed's quantitative easing was the main reason those nine banks were able to pay back TARP.  Again, TARP was just some fast money to stop runs on the banks and, as your data suggests, a relatively small amount of money.<p>So, why did the Fed print money and give it to the banks?  Because otherwise we would have no financial system and, then, no economy and then hunger, revolution, war, massive death, etc., little things like that.<p>So, what happened to the money the banks were supposed to have, that is, the money the Fed replaced?  It disappeared!  Uh, actually with 'fractional reserve banking' the banks can essentially 'create money'.  Or you borrow $100 from a bank and deposit the loan in your checking account.  Then the bank loans out $90 which is deposited in a checking account.  Then they loan out $81 which is deposited in a checking account.  It's called the 'multiplier effect'.  So, that's mostly the same $100 loaned out 3+ times.<p>It may be that the bank only has about $10 of the stockholders' money and the rest is from depositors via checking accounts ('demand deposits').  So, the bank has maybe $10 but about $300 loaned out.<p>Loaning money this way on 'financial assets', e.g., to buy stocks, especially on thin margin, that is, with high leverage, can blow an asset bubble -- 1929.  So we passed some laws keeping banks from loaning money for such purposes and put in place some higher margin requirements.  Then the sneaky bankers discovered houses, Fannie, Freddie, the CRA, adjustable rate mortgages, the Countrywide business model, and 'social justice' and blew a bubble based on housing instead of stocks.<p>When the stock market bubble burst in 1929, we got The Great Depression.  When the housing bubble burst in 2008, we got The Great Recession.  See a pattern here?<p>Now if the economy gets sick from, say, a popped bubble, then some of that $300 in loans won't get paid back.  If as much as $10 of that $300 doesn't come back, then the bank is bust.  In simple terms, that's what happened in the housing bubble, both its growth and its shrinkage.<p>So, when the bubble burst, some of that $300 or so the bank created is destroyed.<p>So, we can try to continue on with that money destroyed, but that would cause deflation.  In a credit economy, deflation is a bummer because the easy way to make money is just not to spend it and just to put it under a mattress.  So the economy goes into the tank and just stays there as people get poor, sick, cold, and dead.  We can get wars that way.  At least we can get people 'occupying' city parks.<p>So, the Fed is trying to avoid deflation.  But the economy is very sick, and even with interest rates near 0.00% per year the economy is plenty sick.  Why?  We don't get good answers from the newsies, not even Bloomberg, but first cut businesses don't want to borrow for inventory, expansion, etc. because the customers aren't coming, and the banks don't want to lend because the businesses are sick and might not pay back.  Or, the Fed's money has the banks flush again, but that money is not yet in the hands of small businesses and consumers.<p>Maybe a better solution would have been Milton Friedman's Helicopter:  Print up some money, about what was destroyed, load it into a helicopter, fly across the US, scatter it, and let people pick it up and spend it.  This is not entirely a joke.<p>There is a great title for a magazine and maybe a Web site -- Secret Romantic Confessions.  It's TOO tempting not to look!  Well, Bloomberg is a newsie site so has Fed ""secrets"", 'secret money given away'.  BS.  Total, 100%, reeking, fuming, bubbling, sticky BS.  Grab'm by the heart, gut, and below the belt nonsense BS and collect the ad revenue.  Net, Bloomberg is spouting nonsense to get yahoos up on their hind legs.  Deliberate, deceptive, destructive nonsense.  Of COURSE the Fed gave money to the banks:  That's EXACTLY what 'quantitative easing' meant to anyone but a total yahoo, idiot, fool.  There was no 'secret' involved!<p>It was just such nonsense from yahoos that was largely responsible for killing about 100 million people from the crash in 1929 to the end of WWII in 1945.  How?  Because when the US stock market bubble burst in 1929, a LOT of money the banks had created by loaning money to buy stocks on thin margin was destroyed.  Remember ""The Roaring 20's?""  -- lots of parties from lots of money created by bank lending.<p>So, when the bubble burst, we had no banking system.  Even out in Kansas, depositors lost 100%.  We were back to a barter economy.  We had massive deflation:<p>""For Sale.  Nearly new car.  Lost all in stock market.  No offer too low.""<p>""Deflation is the easiest thing in the world to fix:  Just print money."".  But we didn't.  Various yahoos didn't understand we needed to PRINT MONEY.  However even Betty Boop understood.  Still we didn't.<p>So we went from 1929 to 1941 refusing to print money as needed.  Unemployment was a disaster.  Some of the problems in loss of US 'social capital' are STILL with us.  Dumb.  Really dumb.<p>Since the US was not buying, foreign developed economies were not selling to us.  Since part of their economy was not selling, that part was not buying, and other sellers in that economy were not selling.  Nearly no one was either buying or selling.  The economy shut down.  People were cold and hungry.  So, the sickness of the US economy spread around the developed world.<p>Then along comes a wacko house painter with a solution:  ""Ein Folk.  Ein Reich.  Ein Fhrer"".  He gets dictatorial powers over the economy for four years.  With those powers, actually he puts people back to work, building roads, bridges, ships, guns, tanks, etc.  Yes, he abolishes the labor unions.  Then he gets four more years of dictatorial powers and decides that he wants some new 'living space', say, to the east to a line from, say, Stalingrad to Moscow to Leningrad or, really, just to the Urals.  For the people there, kill a lot of them right away (as 'inferior breeds') and kill the rest slowly as slaves on 1000 calories a day.  What he did resulted in 50 million, maybe 100 million, people dead.<p>Then in 1941 or so people started shooting at us.<p>Then we got serious, and in about three months we had about three jobs for everyone who could work and were OUT of the Great Depression.  Why?  We printed enough money to start to replace what was destroyed in the 1929 market crash.<p>For now?  We can be back to work anytime we want within about three months -- JUST PRINT MONEY.  That's what the Fed is trying to do, but apparently Friedman's Helicopter would be more effective.<p>There's more, but I know; I know:  This is post is already too long for a trivial little subject like putting 25 million people back to work.  But, gotta tell you:  Don't look for anything real on this subject from the newsies.<p>But, if another 100 million people die, or a billion or few, then the newsies will be right there reporting on the pains, the passion, pathos, and poignancy, with poetry, about the human suffering.  They won't have even as much as a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about what caused the problem or how to fix it, but they can report what it 'feels' like.",1323533502

Among men in the study who \n   reported good sex lives before cancer, fewer than half were able to achieve \n   normal erections two years after treatment.\n</code></pre>\nAlso, it's an unattributed quote, but based on some of my interactions with doctors, this rings true:<p><pre><code>   Such sobering statistics are a rarity in any discussion of prostate cancer,\n   partly because surgeons and cancer experts worry that a man might forgo\n   treatment rather than risk his sex life.\n</code></pre>\nFuck them.

Reduce the power and programs run by the federal government, and radically simplify the tax code, and you'll dry up the opportunities for corruption.<p>And that would only treat the problem of government corruption while exacerbating issues of social inequality. I'm all for fiscal responsibility but the empirical evidence seems to suggest that cutting social services and public good projects leads to net harm for society as a whole (see: Texas.)<p>As a whole, I find the prevalence of libertarianism among tech types curious.

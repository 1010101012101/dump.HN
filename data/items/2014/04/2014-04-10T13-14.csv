I think the answer is likely yes.<p>Any decently funded team with a dozen good auditors to commit to the project would be watching popular open source projects like openssl, linux, chromium, firefox, apache, nginx, gnupg, openssh, boost, gmp, berkeley db, qt, gtk, etc.<p>For this part of the project, you only have to grep for low hanging fruit in each new patch that is released for each project, that is usage of: gets, scanf, strncpy, strncat, memcpy etc (or the equivalents for each project that has wrappers or handling functions).<p>Any large state actor with any decent team running such a project would have discovered heartbleed within days of it being committed. They also would have discovered a lot of other bugs that we either don&#x27;t know about yet or have fixed.<p>With heartbleed the state actors are kicking themselves either way: either because they didn&#x27;t know about the bug and missed it, or they did know about the bug and now can no longer use it as effectively.<p>&quot;They&quot; (and you can include black hat groups that don&#x27;t disclose in this as well) combined likely have more resources dedicated to uncovering these bugs than what the open community does, and it might be an order of magnitude larger.<p>When you think about this further, you realize that the state actors having discovered heartbleed or not doesn&#x27;t matter - what <i>does matter</i> is that they <i>do</i> have a lot of exploits that we don&#x27;t know about and it has been confirmed that they are not only looking for these bugs and have a lot of people working on it, but are actively discovering them, using them and purchasing them on the market.<p>The response to this shouldn&#x27;t be heartbleed specific - it should be what do &quot;we&quot; do to stop &quot;them&quot; from discovering and using exploits from open source and projects. There needs to be a heck of a lot more effort or a whole new approach to defeat the level resources that are out there dedicated to uncovering and not disclosing these exploits.<p>The best thing that could have happen did happen: heartbleed was discovered and it was disclosed, and a hell of a lot of people are now more aware of just how frail some of this infrastructure is and what the risks are.",1397138214

The cost of fab toolsets and the cost of chip design are the culprits.<p>Many cutting-edge tools (etchers, deposition, others) now come with price tags of >$5M. A new 200mm fab can easily run north of $4B. The relentless trend of feature size shrinkage is still happening - some designs are underway using 16nm FinFet technology - but at the cost of increased power consumption and increased cost-per-transistor. I believe it was Nvidia that put a shot across the bow of chip manufacturers by saying they saw no economic advantage in chasing the lastest process node.<p>A clean-sheet-of-paper microprocessor design can easily hit $50M in expenses before the first chip is seen. Much of that expense is sheer manpower & verification processing cycles - a billion transistors&#x27; worth of real estate is worthless unless you can run a test suite against it. If you&#x27;re spending >$50M on a new design, you&#x27;d better have a locked-in customer. Projecting that amount of investment for a squishy market like a new consumer electronics widge is the surest way to get your project killed.<p>Running a microprocessor at ever-greater frequencies doesn&#x27;t help either. First, you&#x27;re cooking your chip. Frequency = heat. Second, every processor vendor in the world is limited by the processor-memory chokepoint. You can&#x27;t read data & code from memory into the processor(s) fast enough to keep the processor pipeline full. And the gap is widening.",1397138143

The ramifications of this would be the NSA not only being able to see other people&#x27;s secure traffic, but the potential for <i>our traffic</i> to be intercepted and decoded: this is not, as far as I understand, a win condition for the NSA. I could see the FBI being all for &quot;the world has no secrets anymore&quot;, but the NSA has a different agenda.<p>This is a fundamentally different situation than a backdoor in a parameterized encryption standard, such as ECDSA (which is often referenced in these discussions): there, only the people who built the backdoor can use the backdoor. Here, the backdoor exists in a shared resource, waiting for others--including your enemies--to take advantage of; that&#x27;s quite a risk, and unless you&#x27;ve been seeing some weird behavior--such as the NSA distributing heartbeat-disabled builds of OpenSSL for any potential government usage--I think it is a horrible stretch to believe that they&#x27;ve been sitting on this bug (or even having themselves planted the bug), using it as the long-term surveillance means that some people seem to be want to believe.<p>Frankly, the fact that they&#x27;ve been logging SSL traffic is enough: for systems without perfect forward security, if they don&#x27;t already have the keys through other means, they just wait for an opportunity like yesterday and then attempt to quickly get the keys they want. I would almost go so far as to claim the NSA was being negligent in their strategy (not that I like this strategy, mind you) if they didn&#x27;t follow through to that point. But I just don&#x27;t see it as being rational to believe the NSA is willing to make our own country&#x27;s secrets less secure if they are seeing benefits using the bug against others; if anything, I could see them trying to secretly (so as not to tip their hand as having had any advanced notice) fix the bug (after using it for a short time period to pull a bunch of keys, of course ;P).",1397135905

I&#x27;m not exaggerating, it isn&#x27;t even well-suited for the domain it is mainly used for (i.e., designing digital hardware circuits). For example:<p>1) Synthesis/simulation mismatch: Your design might work in simulation but not in hardware, <i>and vice versa</i>. Often, this is due to X-value (representing unknown/invalid values) problems.<p>2) Signed datatypes: If you mix signed and unsigned values in an expression, the result is <i>unsigned</i>. So, if <i>a</i> is unsigned and has the value 4, <i>b</i> is signed and has the value -3, then<p><pre><code>  (a * b) < 5\n</code></pre>\nwill return 0 (false), while<p><pre><code>  ($signed(a) * b) < 5\n</code></pre>\nwill correctly return 1 (true). That&#x27;s because signed datatypes are just an afterthought and weren&#x27;t officially introduced until 2001, more than 15 years after the language&#x27;s inception.<p>3) If an undeclared net is used in an module instantiation, the compiler silently creates a 1 bit net with that name. No error message, no warning. You can turn off that stupid behavior with a compiler directive, but you have to turn it back on at the end of your file, because otherwise its effects are active in <i>all files compiled afterwards</i>, and many third-party sources don&#x27;t work correctly with this setting.<p>VHDL is also a bad language, but for very different reasons.

Of course, it&#x27;s not surprising these things are crufty - html is ancient, and clearly wasn&#x27;t designed for today&#x27;s world; and the same holds for CSS.  But just because the author mentions something that&#x27;s true doesn&#x27;t mean his conclusions make sense.  His solutions sound good, but they&#x27;re really superficial and hide mistakes at least as bad as those html+css make today.<p>There are two fundamental ways to improve the dom layout model&#x27;s cruft:  By cleaning up weird legacy issues, and by fundamentally changing the way it works (i.e. introducing new layout models, or splitting styling from layout etc.)<p>I think it&#x27;s important to realize that removing cruft is virtually impossible.  The cleanliness we seek to simplify our lives in making new things simply isn&#x27;t as valuable as support for old things.  Legacy matters; it&#x27;s unhandy, but it&#x27;s also valuable.<p>So let&#x27;s make the realistic assumption that the DOM of today isn&#x27;t going away.  You can&#x27;t clean it up; you can only add things that work more easiliy, and perhaps discourage old, confusing behavior.  That means thinking about and settling on what this new behavior should be.<p>The author&#x27;s idea of splitting layout from styling simply won&#x27;t work the way he expects it to.  He suggests styling text nodes i.e. via `table text` and not have typography related styles on tables themselves.  Sounds neat, but this won&#x27;t work with today&#x27;s CSS inheritance rules.  If both `table text` and `bold text` were to match, css chooses the more specific (disambiguating by css order) rule.  That&#x27;s really not what you wanted to have happen though - just because bold was defined first in css doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s less important.  Here, we want specificy in order of DOM ancestry, not selector specificity.  In essence, CSS already does the split he imagines - most typography related properties inherit, others generally do not.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that the OP&#x27;s article really has anything insight worth mentioning.  Sure, there&#x27;s lots of legacy, but clearly we can&#x27;t just dump that.  Other improvements are possibly, but he doesn&#x27;t make a clear case for any specific, clearly better alternative.",1397135102

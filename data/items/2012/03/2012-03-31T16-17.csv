When offline, the file is temporary stored on our servers.<p>Monetization would be achieved with monthly bandwidth quotas on files sent through the web.<p>The cross platform client is nearly ready. ( should be really usable in the next few hours ) and we are trying some UI ideas.<p>We set up a landing page for now so you can check it out at http://www.dropsendapp.com<p>If you like the idea, just click download you won't download anything for now, but it will count as ""vote"" for our market validation.<p>Cheers!",1333212962

Dealers know this ""trick"" and what they do when you tell them you only have $10k is that they sell you an $8k car for $10k. That's how it works. So be careful. Pick the car first then say how much you only have.<p>Another problem I found is that if you want a particular car model and you don't live a in a large metropolitan area you might only have 3 or 4 places to choose from. They know it too. You walk away from all 3 or 4 places now you have to drive 100 miles to another city perhaps.<p>Another nasty thing, car salesmen in an area, know each other. A lot of dealerships are revolving doors and salesmen just rotate from one to another. When you go to one and tell them the other dealership's price, they say ""Oh Joe, he is so silly, he used to work here, we can do better, we can give you $100 less"".<p>In the end of the day you also don't know how pressed they are to sell that car. If there is a line at the door waiting to pay $1000 more for it. You'll just have to walk away without a car.<p>One more thing. Car options. A lot dealerships will put ""crap"" on your car. Nitrogen filled tires. Fancy decals. Anti-fairy-dust coatings. All that cost maybe $50 dollars or so but tell you all those things cost $1000 more, but they are ""giving them away"" for $500, and they put them standard on every car. So the price they quoted you through email, doesn't exist because all cars have these extra features. So don't fall into this one.",1333212796

There's a few things you need to know about mice in the lab. First, they're inbred. Everyone works in a few, genetically homogeneous strains (typically with a number of serious genetic defects). Typically the results found in one strain change entirely when done in another strain. Laboratories deal with this by only working on one strain and ignoring all the others. Second, the standard care practices throughout the world for lab mice leave them morbidly obese and inactive. All lab mice suffer from metabolic syndrome. Any time you see a result in the literature on obesity, fat buildup, heart disease, diabetes, or any other metabolic issue where the experiments were done on mice, it is more likely that the experiment's treatment made the mice drop some weight and become more metabolically normal than that it had any actual effect.",1333211475

The jury is still out there to see if traffic can be converted into loyal customers (which I argue NO for NYC) whether that's groupon vendors or 99c pizza.<p>What's the difference between a restaurant that charges 99c cheese pizza but 2.00 for pepperoni pizza v. a spa that gives 70% off of a $100 spa service through lifebooker or groupon deal sites? (btw, if you look at the way these coupon site's business model works, $100 70% off that you buy for $30 doesn't mean vendor gave only 70% off.  Groupon take ~30% of that $30 so vendor really only get $21 in return for value of $100. Furthermore, groupon squeezes net working capital by giving that cash to the spa after 15-20-45 days from when Groupon received the money).<p>Both type of businesses should be near break-even profitability at best UNLESS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO UPSELL their services/products or they do it to drive in traffic in hopes of converting them into return customers (marketing cost of doing business).  However, in NYC where there are 10,000+ restaurants and hundreds of groupon-esque deals daily and in every corner there's a 99c pizzeria, this traffic is worthless traffic and it's permanently creating a lower RONA (return on net assets) for the entire industry. These pricing schemes get played out in the convenience stores as well in the boonies (w/r/t cigarette and beer pricing).<p>Maybe these local vendors are smarter than I think and have figured out a way to upsell people into purchasing 100% premium pizza for 1 additional topping or restaurants make up the discount and stay profitable through selling higher margins products in conjunction with the coupon (alcohol for instance is 100% margin product) -- so then at spas, I would hypothesize that the upsell potential to be much lower than restaurants so they're just f'd. But to say that we can last longer than the other vendor is completely moronic and naive view of their customer base - why don't they ask abercrombie and fitch and every other u.s. retailer what happens when they turned promotional in 2008 and now they've tried to curb heavy promoting.  Price Stickiness is very hard to get rid of for the consumer especially on the value end of the spectrum.<p>Regardless of all these pricing wars, one can't imply that all pizzeria's margins are toast or all restaurants are toast.  Jean George has no problems filling his seats at his michelin star rated restaurants offering no groupon just like Artichoke Basil, a late night pizzeria, in NY doesn't have any problems selling great artisan pizza at an overpriced price to clubbers coming out of the Avenue and 1-oak (2 super-exclusive bottle service only high-end nightclub in NYC) at 2am.  That's just smart business and superior product -> turning a commodity business into a sought after premium charged product.  If you're spending $500 for 1 bottle of grey goose to get into a club, you're completely fine coming out drunk and spending $10-$12 for a small pan pizza as long as it looks like high-end.",1333211227

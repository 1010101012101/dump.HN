What we are watching now is silver bullets riddling companies and company execs who probably need to be riddled with silver bullets.<p>Unfortunately some innocents will end up going down with the ship but this has always been the case.   Events like we are watching right now are caused by human weakness and human failings not by free markets.",1222087880

During this political season, this is going to be politics and finance.<p>You can't flag it. This is stuff that hackers are interested in as you can tell by simply looking at the number of comments and votes. The site is supposed to self-regulate, but no amount of pointing out that the system is flawed seems to make a difference. Instead, you'll get dinged for complaining.<p>Love the crowd. Love startups and hacking. Think the up-down voting paradigm in long-dead and not crazy about continuously getting into political discussions with people I'd rather be learning from.",1222087723

The alternative to standardized testing is a rigorous, universal curriculum overseen by the state or federal government; otherwise, people will game the system by sending their children to whichever school marks the most generously.",1222087421

I've heard justifications about banks underwriting a bond and then having the commercial bank buy it, but these justifications never agree on who is defrauding whom. It is very easy for an investment bank and a commercial bank to make that kind of deal even if they don't share a corporate parent (""Oh, you want in on the next big IPO? Well, let me tell you how to get to the top of the list! I just need one little favor..."").<p>Actually, all of the justifications I've heard seem to imply that Glass-Steagall was necessary to criminalize things like fraud and undisclosed conflicts of interest, which I thought were already illegal.",1222086740

If SATs are taken less seriously as masses of people say that it is an inaccurate prediction of intelligence, only past performance is a major factor in the admission process.<p>And perhaps you're like me who didn't give a damn about what the school teaches, because other things seem more important, like entrepreneurship, and yet extracurriculars and character only make about 25-33% of the decision.",1222086416

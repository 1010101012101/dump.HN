407188,comment,405680,407083,0,0,Retric,,,"When talking about children age * IQ / 100 ~= mental if it's under 16 works as a reasonable approximation for younger children across much of the IQ spectrum.  So a 10 year old with an IQ of 70 has a mental age of 7, and someone with an IQ of 150 has a mental age of 15 etc.  Now we have redefined IQ to have a more mathematical basis but the approximation still holds.<p>PS: It's not really completely accurate, but you can treat a 6 year old and a 12 year old with the same mental age in about the same way and see similar types of responses.",1230000210
407187,comment,406010,406106,0,0,gruseom,,,"I think the parent comment was probably trolling, but as someone who loves Lisp I have to say that some people have  deeper reasons for not liking it than ""libraries"". A few of the best programmers I know just don't like Lisp. They tell me s-expressions don't fit the way their brains work. I'm not inclined to dismiss this as laziness, stupidity, or ignorance - though it's tempting :)<p><i>If you don't need the things that only Lisp can do, there's not as much of a reason to use it.</i><p>This is not an unreasonable thing to say, yet I'm skeptical. The problem is that a lot of the things that are natural to do in language X just wouldn't occur to you in language Y. I think this is a big problem with the way people compare programming languages. I've been meaning to write a post about it sometime.",1230000209

Or, perhaps provide a list of 5 recommended books, in case a single choice might be restricting the next book choice too tightly.<p>This both stimulates us to discuss the book insightfully (so we can pick the next book), and it resolves the dilemma of picking the next book!",1230000175

We don't have the same gaps in our knowledge and I don't have time (or interest) to read about the stuff that you're interested in that I'm not.<p>Book clubs seem to make more sense for fiction where the goal is entertainment or being more cultured or whatever.  For non-fiction, my reading choices are much more pragmatic and I also don't mind just reading the parts of a book that are interesting to me.  I don't fundamentally want to read more business or hacking books; I want to fill the gaps in my knowledge.",1229999898

407172,comment,406683,406683,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"This is really unfortunate, on several levels.<p>It's probably also self-reinforcing once it starts, because once a mailing list, IRC channel, etc. has a reputation of being populated by abrasive know-it-alls, new members have less of an incentive to bother being civil. Also, people mock-trolling to get useful answers is incredibly irritating to everyone else, which probably makes the overall attitude even less patient with newbie questions.<p>I don't know of a better way around this, either, but it reminds me of an offhand comment somebody made recently about how once cultural forces take a certain amount of bribery and corruption for granted, doing things honestly at all becomes much more difficult.",1229999001

It was invite-only (they did not list it publically), and such a bid would never fly by usual eLance (i.e., Indian outsourcing) standards.<p>Fortunately, I have a regular income (and besides that am still young enough to mooch off my parents), so I can afford to only take nuggets like that. :)<p>EDIT: Come to think of it...I never look for a freelancing offer anymore, last I did was months ago.

407156,comment,407148,407148,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"I think the reason is timing. Java took a huge market share during a software boom. It looked attractive at the time because it was an improvement over, but still similar to, existing languages. It also appealed to a perceived need of the time, making it hard for mediocre programmers to screw up.<p>We've learned since that it's much more important to make it hard for mediocre product managers to screw up by using a language that encourages rapid iteration. However, Java still gets chosen by occasional intelligent programmers because it developed a few robust libraries.",1229998477

Just because a company's having a hard time doesn't mean it should never advertise. Sometimes it should advertise more.<p>And the American car companies have figured out what cars people want and at what price range. They were selling SUVs before the rest, for example. The problem is that the other car companies can quickly copy them, and the price range is set by the market, which is flooded with Japanese cars of the same sort. The Japanese can undercut them because of their lower employee salaries.<p>It's not as if the American car companies can't make a decent car. They just can't make one that doesn't cost $2k more than the Japanese because of their cost basis. No amount of innovation can overcome that.",1229998465

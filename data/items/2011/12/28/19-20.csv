It's a big echo chamber.<p>Now, I'm not saying there's ""no harm done"" because they only redefined the terms. What I'm saying is that it seems like we're focusing so narrowly on one SOPA related story and missing the larger picture. Hasn't the GoDaddy story played itself out? There are other angles than GoDaddy and I'd be surprised if anyone is learning anything new or benefitting at all from these new ones. After the first 3 days of almost all GoDaddy/SOPA stories around here I think we've said all there is to say about it. At this point its gone from constructive discussion to just a lot of repitition and whining.<p>And yeah, I did mean not <i>all</i> the stories are true. Why do people have to nitpick? You obviously knew what I meant and I'm sure others are smart enough to get it too. The stories I was referring to we're the ones implying that GoDaddy wrote SOPA and that they gave themselves an exemption from it as if they're the only ones getting that exemption.<p>My original comment was a perfectly valid and reasonable point. If you start cherry picking tiny little details you don't agree with or that aren't perfectly worded then you're missing the whole point. Let me state the point very concisely and maybe you'll find you actually agree with me:<p>The GoDaddy stories have become repetitive and unproductive. The stories have been polluted with misinformation and false assumptions. We've said all there is to say and this is distracting us from stopping this bill from passing. Boycotting them is a great way to protest but let's talk about some other things we can do like we had been doing before the GoDaddy story broke.<p>This whole thing reminds me of how politicians use news cycles to their advantage. Sometimes you can't get around bad press so you pick out one aspect of a story to get the public all riled up this distracting them from the real story. What is the real story? I have no idea and I'm sure I couldn't find out on HN as it stands now because we're caught up in an infinite loop of the ""GoDaddy wrote SOPA and gave itself exemptions"" story.",1325102014

This said, I have a huge problem with this general mentality and I think a lot of today's entrepreneurs are spoiled brats that don't have their perspectives right.<p>I have had an awesome experience in Chile and it has been one of my best decisions I have made. I have met my girlfriend here, I have scaled my business a lot, I have learned to surf, I have met amazing people from all around the world etc. On top of this, my company got $40.000 free money. The reimbursement process could be improved, but generally I did not have that much problems with it.<p>The problem I see is that people expect everything on a silver plate. They expect everything to be perfect. And of course, if you expect this you will be disappointed by Chile and Start-Up Chile - - because it isn't perfect and they have a long way to go, but they are trying hard to create a good platform for entrepreneurs and so far I think they are doing a great job (and a better job than most other countries in the world).<p>Maybe this lack of perspectives is culturally/experience bound. For me, my dad's story as an entrepreneur gives me perspective that I have it good and that I have much better opportunities than he ever had. My dad was an entrepreneur that quit his factory job to start his own business in his early 20's. He worked 12 hours pr. day at least. He worked and scaled his business for over 20 years - - to provide education for my siblings and good life for my family. Then the Bosnian war came and we lost it _all_. We had to relocate to Denmark, a country where we did not speak the language (and I can tell you that Danish isn't an easy language to learn). What did my dad do? He learned Danish and started another successful business in his late 40's.<p>So when I see people complain about the process of getting free money or that the chairs in the offices are bad then I laugh, because I think they have no perspective of what it takes to build a business, how hard building a business is for majority of people or what struggles other people have.",1325101980

Thats all good, but proper scientific research starts once a well defined problem is synthesized into a testable hypothesis.<p>The gap between thought exploration and observable hypotheses can be called philosophy.  However, usually when this gap is paired with an assumed purpose (absent a testable or confirmed hypothesis), this is best described as religion.<p>Why say 'save the world' in order to solicit donations?  You really don't know enough about the problem to pre-suppose that any philosophy you are generating will create testable observable knowledge, or that in turn, that the findings of these observations would even come close to 'saving the world', or even providing any measurable benefit to the world - you just don't know.<p>Why not just say you are a group of researchers trying to better define potential problems generated from AI-related extrinsic risks?<p>Why do I care?

3401079,comment,3400508,3400508,2,0,ellyagg,,,"What a fatalistic article. Before taking the tone that this article does, I would need to see hundreds of studies suggesting that reversing overweight tendencies is not possible. It may be the minority, but legions of people have reversed their weight problems, and not all required herculean efforts. It's very doubtful that once you're significantly overweight, there's no hope.<p>While we need this research, this article spins it to make it less than helpful for a certain segment of the population. Rather than focusing on the people (most of them), who can't maintain their weight after dieting, we really need more research explaining those who can, and not simple dismissals that those rare people are machines whose lives revolve around counting calories. People can change their metabolism. For example, there is a case study documenting someone who lost almost 400 pounds over the course of just over a year, using a strict fast[1]. After 5 years, he had maintained his weight loss. Why was that? I can think of possible reasons that have not been thoroughly studied. For instance, after several days or weeks, people on strict fasts report not feeling hungry any longer. Is it possible one's metabolism/sense of hunger resets on a strict fast?<p>Long term fasting can be dangerous, not least of which because very overweight people often have other health problems. The study cited mentions several people who died on long term fasts, particularly during refeeding. Due to the danger, and probable need for doctor supervision, safe systems of long term strict fasts haven't necessarily been fully fleshed out, although some fasting diets exist that aren't strict fasts, and I would imagine would be quite safe, like PSMF or Dukan diet.<p>What I like about a fasting diet is that there's no room for fooling yourself. As soon as you introduce attempts to mimic yummy foods or introduce varieties of flavor and texture, you open the door to cheating and desiring things you can't have. If, on the other hand, you're consuming 600 calories of whey protein and some green powder for nutrients, there's little room for error.<p>We know that the human metabolism isn't a simple calories in, calories out furnace. Medical research is very clear that this isn't the case. Good Calories, Bad Calories is heavily cited. One example that confounds a simple arithmetical analysis is that the body uses a lot more energy to turn protein into fat. So the body uses calories to store calories in that case. Another example is that eating carbs actually changes most people's behavior: Unless they are consciously counting, people will tend to eat more food if they are eating carbs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pmj.bmj.com/content/49/569/203.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pmj.bmj.com/content/49/569/203.full.pdf</a>",1325101753

Then they would know who to invite to their research group.  Neither of these made for a particularly fun experience.<p>But at the same time, some of the classes had very difficult subject matter and the professors were actually interested in teaching students instead of torturing them.

Sorry, my mistake.<p>The thing is - in order for a true AI to act independently it has to have a purpose. Humans act the way we do because we want to have some sort of positive experience and want to avoid negative experiences. If we couldn't experience anything either positive or negative we wouldn't have a reason or motivation to do anything, we would just be. At that point we might as well be static dead objects. For AIs to act intelligently & independently and not just as algorithms solving a single task they need to have some sort of purpose/goal to reach. An independent AI can't be indifferent - it needs a basis for taking decisions.<p>I don't see how the purpose we give the AI could be detrimental for humans without severe negligence.

The human body is an adaptive organism and will fight any drastic changes trying to stay in balance. 500 calories a day will certainly cause the body to begin changing hormone levels. Then you come out of it after a while and start eating correctly you still have severely imbalances hormones (relative to normal levels). So now you're eating healthy but have completely screwed up the way your body handles food, essentially storing more calories than before. If you slowly shift into better habits and allow your body time to keep up you'll end up with a calorie burning machine. The main problem is people get so motivated to change they dive in head first (such as. 500 calorie per day diet), throw everything out of whack, try to maintain their losses which start coming back and end up worse than where they started.",1325099748

When we avoid our favorite foods, we deplete our willpower.  When that reserve is gone, it is much more difficult for us to make the ""right"" choice.<p>The really interesting twist was when they presented the brain glucose study results.  The authors suggest that it's glucose levels in the brain that partially determine the size of the willpower reserve.  Thus, when you diet, you not only deplete your reserve by making a decision to avoid fatty foots, but you also starve your brain of the glucose it needs to replenish the ability to make tough decisions.<p>They support it with some interesting and fairly compelling evidence.

Obviously if you're dealing with, say, sensitive customer data like card numbers or any sort of legally privileged information, then you have to have robust security in place across the board.<p>More often, in the particular cases I'm familiar with, we're talking about commercially sensitive information, where we have to weigh up the costs of complete end-to-end encryption by default against the loss of productivity that results when things like big network file transfers slow way down. In a self-funded small company, with limited staff time and limited cash, total encryption is not always the answer.<p>For example, I think you can reasonably have a policy that encryption of any removable media is required but anything screwed into a rack in the office is biased toward performance, and in fact that is basically what we do in most cases. But it does limit the value of the kinds of warranties we're talking about, because we're not going to just hand over a hard drive that has probably had sensitive company documents on it to some random delivery service.<p>Similarly, from a personal point of view, I don't consider theft of my home computers to be a very high risk, so I don't routinely encrypt all the hard drives, even though I have some potentially sensitive data like downloaded bank statements and bills on there. Instead, I expect to keep the hard drives for a relatively long time anyway, and then have them securely wiped/destroyed when they are too old/broken to be useful any more.<p>Just to be clear, I'm not saying these choices are anyone's problem but my own. I accept the cost of the occasional hard drive failure as a natural consequence of these policies. I'm just saying that it means hard drive manufacturers' long-term warrantes are effectively not worth anything to me or the companies I run. I suspect that in practice plenty of other people/small businesses follow similar procedures, and therefore the warranties probably aren't worth much to them either.",1325099195

That was a consistent theme--people asserting that her attitude about women in business/tech/being under represented was a result of her having a lot of advantages (via men propping her up and sponsoring her) that most women don't have.  And I don't know your mother but what I said is hardly BS.  I'm sure both she and you know who I mean by ""most women"" I mean women who make up the vast majority of women in our western society. Women who have to choose between giving their all to their career and having children because unlike Sandberg they don't have nannies or a 50/50 relationship where they can expect their husband to co-parent.  Women who aren't mentored by the best of the best and don't have parents who are PhD (dropouts) and Ophthalmologists.  I'm not discounting anything she's done--she's remarkable and a brilliant person.  But for her to act like other women aren't doing what she's doing because they aren't assertive enough or that the problem lies within their reaction to sexism--give me a break. In the article somebody counters her points on that by saying that Sandberg acts as if this is a meritocracy when it's not--that's spot on.<p>As for glass ceiling metaphor, why don't you ask Sandberg what she's referring to. I was just referencing what she said ""She opposes all forms of affirmative action for women. If you dont believe there is a glass ceiling, there is no need, she told me.""<p>Oh and as for specifics about being propped up and sponsored by men I'd point to things like this ""In January of 1991, Summers became the chief economist at the World Bank, and that spring he recruited Sandberg as a research assistant."" I don't care how smart or good you are, without certain connections you're not going to get a research associateship at the world bank.",1309762461

Which is what skews the numbers in favor of men (people abort female babies on a regular basis to avoid paying dowry when they grow up). When people realize there aren't that many females to go around, the dowry concept will reverse, it will be men paying to get married. Then the economic incentives will reverse, and the ratios will balance. That's how the market solves it. Hopefully by then rising prosperity and gender equality will eliminate this practice before the scales tip the other way again.",1309762084

After seeing how well corporations have dealt with IP addresses, I'm not so sure about this. Add in the possibility of a random war suddenly quadrupling the price of oil, and the fact that it might take twenty-plus years to switch the energy industry over to another technology, and I find it very believable that we'll wake up one day and be all ""oh shit we can't produce enough energy.""<p><pre><code>  South East Asia will have a 300m person gender imbalance</code></pre>

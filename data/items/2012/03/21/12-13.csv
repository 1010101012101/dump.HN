The only reason we've evolved is because people holding those opinions were allowed to voice them.<p>Of course, for every ""good"" opinion there were a thousand hateful and wrong-headed opinions. But that's the way it works. You let in everybody and allow reasoned discourse to sort them all out.<p>Yes, there is a very rare segment of society that are actually evil, and there's nothing much to be done with those folks. Let them express their opinions, punish them when they take actions, just like we treat everybody else. You don't have an obligation to talk to idiotic people, or even say nice things about them. They just have a right to think as they choose.<p>What I find most shocking is the idea that simply because I am extremely offended by your opinion -- the way you think -- I should take some action against you: fire you, put you in jail, have you ""re-educated"", etc. No matter how offended I am at somebody's opinion, as long as they don't take action on it (express it rudely, hurt another person, become an embarrassment for the organization, and so on), I will fight for the death for their right to have it. That's the entire basis of a secular society, the root of the enlightenment. But a large majority of people don't understand that.<p>To me that's a lot more worrisome than a couple of jackasses.

To the guys who wrote this, this faux pas may well feel no more significant than forgetting to match your belt to your shoes.  But the latter is -- wait they're supposed to match? is that why people look at me funny?  And the former got them ridden out of town on a rail.<p>The answer is, yes and no.  I'm certainly not politically correct -- I think I'm leading for Most Downvoted 2012 -- but there are some flavors of clueless that create problems beyond their immediate vicinity.  This particular form is so predictable that it can easily cause a lot of women to just avoid settings where it appears, which pushes them away from activities they might otherwise enjoy and at which they might excel.  If we want to provide those people avenues to what they might be good at, we have to make something more of such idiocy than we would of other idiocies.<p>But I think it is very useful to object to the important idiocies in a measured, thoughtful tone.  Because this conveys This Is Serious, and encourages the knuckleheads to _think_ about what they've mistaken.  I don't want them to learn to camouflage their boneheadedness from predictable outrage, I want them to be less boneheaded.  When you're yelling at someone really the only thing they can do is make apology noises and retreat, which isn't exactly what you want here.

It could have worked out very differently for Nash.</i><p>I agree strongly, in cases where the opinion is held out of ignorance or misunderstanding, or some root that isn't itself malicious.<p>People exist who hold, or pretend to hold offensive, or actually incorrect ""opinions"" for the purposes of power-gathering or pure getting-off-on-pissing-people-off. The latter can range from harmless to very frustrating, the former are dangerous. It becomes obvious that they have explicit motives behind ""holding"" and expressing an opinion quickly enough, but if the former manages to gather enough people around it it becomes a force to be reckoned with quickly.<p>Luckily there aren't very many of either of those two types of people, and the best way to avoid malicious ones actually ... doing anything malicious is through a well-educated populace and encouraging people to think and challenging the ideas present in a sane manner -- I mention this stuff mostly due to thinking that it's important to make and know the distinctions between respecting a person, respecting a person's right to an opinion, and keeping in mind that that person does not have a right to voice opinions and have them considered with equal weight, does not have a right to voice opinions and not have them traits like bigotry, purposeful ignorance, attempts at manipulation, and so on.

Believing that slavery is good is not only a generally offensive position, but it is an opinion that implies poor morals. Therefore not only in general company is expressing such an opinion a poor choice if one wishes to be socially accepted, but having the opinion itself is an abomination.<p>Being easily offended is not a good thing. And anything that divides for the purpose of uniting, like political correctness, enforced diversity, etc. is suspect because it can annoy or hurt a group, even if that group is in a power or majority position. And people have the right to be offended or not offended. A morally corrupt person has the right to hang out in the Hall of Evil if they would like. That is freedom.<p>But the purpose of the original post being discussed is that there is a way to apologize, and for that matter a reason to apologize. I personally think the apology was warranted. But, in the case of wanting to bring back slavery, I just don't think you can defend it as a moral opinion that should be aired.

There's a minor point in there somewhere about how wording apologies in terms of the receiver-of-offense is a common tactic for people who care most about what the average person thinks of them.<p>In this case, I can <i>just barely</i> see this being done by someone who was totally aware of how what they posted sounds, but forgot that the context that might allow them to make that joke, amongst people where it would be obvious that it was intended as a jab at a stereotype that all parties thought shouldn't exist, does not exist where it was posted. And then also hit a bit of a panic mode and put up a sheepish apology like that.<p>I know enough people that have actually done things similar to that. Not because they didn't understand the issues, but because they were distractable, burst-of-extroversion, nerdy younger folk who tended to forget  here and there that the reality bubble they were in was not a universal one, and didn't know how to own up to a mistake well.<p>I absolutely agree with you about the right to opinion, and that people should not need to <i>apologize</i> for holding one. On the other hand, I do not think that those people have the right to have those opinions <i>respected</i>, and if they're especially ridiculous -- bringing back slavery, or the moon being made of conspiracy, for example -- and they're being expressed publicly and vocally, I do not think that those people have the right to not have their opinions called out in a confrontational manner.<p>Should a <i>person</i> be disrespected for holding a ridiculously offensive opinion?

Interestingly, this effect is blocked when co-administering and NMDA antagonist. Even more interestingly, NMDA antagonists have been observed to reduce/prevent stimulant tolerance.

And yes, businesses have a responsibility to their shareholders to maximize profits. But if that was the only purpose of any business, everyone would be selling luxury watches.<p>YC is not a pension fund putting money in a VC; YC ""makes it happen"". They invest in very early stage companies because they believe that they can help them succeed (and they do).<p>In 2004-2005, PG famously predicted the second coming of Apple; if he had put all of his money in Apple stock then, he would be 17 times richer today.

They should be able to predict who's likely to succeed and who's not, better and better each year.<p>Therefore in all logic they should be <i>reducing</i> the number of startups they fund: put more money in sure winners and don't fund anybody else.<p>And yet they're doing the exact opposite: each batch is larger than the previous one.<p>There can be only two explanations to this: either they're getting worse and worse, and are spreading their bets; or, they're getting better and better and can afford to offer their services to more and more companies.<p>It seems likely that the second option is the correct one.",1332331303

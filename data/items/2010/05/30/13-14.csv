1390469,comment,1390400,1390439,0,0,patio11,,,"<a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo</a> , apparently.<p>The brief version is that you cookie each visitor with a random unique identifier.  Each identifier maps to one of the versions under testing in a durable fashion.  The first time you see an identifier for a particular test, you increment the participant count for that appropriate version.  When a conversion -- here a signup -- happens, you look at the identifier, check what version they saw, and increment the conversion counter.  From then it is just a math problem.  So when you see a conversion rate like 24%, that implies that 24% of people who viewed a page the test was active for signed up prior to becoming lost to the system.  (By, for example, leaving forever, clearing cookies, etc.)<p>Although one could theoretically exclude folks who log in later from the participant count, I think that is a poor use of your time for most people.  Existing site users will be split across all alternatives evenly, so their failure to sign up for the site affects all alternatives easily.  Since A/B testing doesn't really care about the exact value of the conversion rates and focuses on the differences between them, that comes out in the wash.  (Plus, for many services, first time visitors swamp existing users of the service, so even if you were worried about distortion it would be minimal.)",1275227457

1390463,comment,1390277,1390277,0,0,shimon,,,"I once heard of a system for representing threaded comments in a relational database, wherein the ID of each comment was a slash-separated list of its ancestors, e.g.:<p>1      Initial comment<p>1/1    Re: Initial comment<p>1/2    Re: Initial comment<p>1/2/1  Re: Re: Initial comment<p>1/2/2  ...<p>These sorts of IDs have the wonderful property that you can efficiently select any subtree using a LIKE query, e.g. ""SELECT * FROM comments WHERE path LIKE '1/%'"". These queries are efficient because they use string btree indexes.  And the results may even be sorted the right way, provided you have monotonically increasing IDs within each level.<p>I think I read about this technique being used on Slashdot a few years ago, but I can't remember the name or find any reference.

I think for paper a lot of chemicals have to be used?<p>Didn't McDonalds experiment with ""eatable"" packages? Some grain (sweetcorn?) might have the property of being easily molded into cups (think ice cream cones). Then add some wax to make it water proof? Except I suppose wax would melt from hot coffee? Also, growing corn requires water, too.<p>Just as an example - you don't have to treat sweetcorn with chemicals to make it moldable. Maybe a lot of properties of paper are not required for coffee cups, so a simpler material could be used.",1275224778

Of course, it helps that they're a cartel: if any store in this neighborhood hadn't adopted the ""5 yen per bag OR bring your own"" on the same day, they would have done quite a bit of business.<p>I even bought myself a shopping bag, even though my math brain told me that I would likely have to live in Japan for at least another six years until I had recouped the $9 it cost me.",1275224735

If Apple's plan is to sell more hardware through Safari lock-in, it's time to short their stock because they're doing it <i>allll</i> wrong.  Safari can't be ""the next IE6"" because it lacks proprietary features, and the bulk of its difficult to reproduce technology is open source and in fact, already in competitive use.  Even if Safari were the best HTML5 platform, Chrome/Epiphany/(new WebKit browser) would provide an escape from lock-in.<p>And, they're going to do this by not supporting NaCl?  Really?  Let's call NaCl x86-Flash and be done with it.  Running NaCl on an ARM processor is going to be way too slow.  I get that people want to see performant web applications, but the way to do that is via a cleaner, more portable VM, like the LLVM project that Apple is funding.<p>So, shame on me for taking a bite of spam thinking it would be meaty.",1275224514

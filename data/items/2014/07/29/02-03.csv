I am not chiding you for pointing out that Scala does not have the backwards compatibility feature set it would need to compete with something like C.  Only that, C wasn&#x27;t designed with backwards compatibility in mind, it just sort of arrived at it.  Scala is most certainly sacrificing compatibility in the short term to allow for &quot;improvability&quot; for lack of a better term.

In contrast, when you raise a quiet round, you can build your product and achieve product/market fit without worrying about the outside world, instead focusing purely on your customers.<p>2. If no investors are questioning the model, you should be alarmed. Almost by definition, no company seeking a seed round has proven revenue model. Knowing this risk, you should expect some fraction of investors to be questioning it. If none are, then it&#x27;s likely a signal that they&#x27;ve been swayed by smooth-talking founders who are very good at raising investment, but, as you mention, not necessarily fit or ready to build the business they&#x27;re hyping.<p>So if we assume quiet seed rounds help with success, this leads to some questions about YC, which is essentially a loud seed round. Namely: should you announce your YC acceptance before you have product/market fit? Should you go through YC in stealth mode until ready to capitalize on hype?<p>It seems your observations can tell us a lot about the value, or anti-value, of product hype. The lesson seems to be, in the words of Denzel Washington/American Gangster, &quot;the loudest person in the room is probably the weakest.&quot;",1406601063

You put down ten bucks. The team advances to the conference championship, where it’s playing the San Francisco 49ers. At this point, you decide to hedge your bet by putting ten dollars on the 49ers, who are three-to-one favorites to win the game. You’re guaranteed a profit, whatever the outcome.<p>So you made two bets:<p>* $10 at 20:1 for Packers, pays $10 + $10 * 20/1 = $210<p>* $10 at 1:3 for 49ers, pays $10 + $10 * 1/3 = $13.33<p>You spent a total of $20.

Any simplification of the type system with regards to type members.  Any removal of special XML features.  Any fixing of the travesty that is the collections library.<p>Things that are unimportant: &quot;The type system will have theoretical foundations that are given by a minimal core calculus.&quot; A type system being theoretically sound doesn&#x27;t interest me.  What does this provide me in practice?  Macros/Reflection (not that it isn&#x27;t actually important, but unless Macros are central to your paradigm like in Lisp, they are a hack, who cares how hacky they are).  Parallel collections.<p>Things that are missing: Structs.  Structs. Real f&#x27;n Structs (granted this may be a JVM limitation but I&#x27;d trade nearly everything for them).<p>&quot;Why do you think removing the arity limit is not interesting? What&#x27;s your approach when interacting with databases, were tables with tons of columns seem to occur in practice?&quot;<p>Because the only reason I can think of for having giant sized tuples is in a code generation scheme most likely for an ORM system.  Code generation in an ORM system is generally a bad idea and it bothers me that an ORM system seems to have the ear of the language designers.  When I encounter dbs with tons of columns, I fix the db using standard and proven SQL techniques like normalization, views, and stored procedures.  I don&#x27;t need or want a language crutch to get around those standards.<p>&quot;What automatic refactorings would you like to see? Which impression do you have regarding ScalaIDE vs. the IntelliJ plugin?&quot;<p>In an ideal world the Scala refactorings would achieve parity with the Java ones.  As it stands currently, there are a fraction of the number of refactorings and they aren&#x27;t actually safe, even on simple ones like rename or move.  Using Eclipse is a non-starter for me.  I prefer Vim or IntelliJ.  That the Scala maintainers have a defacto standard that goes against my (and many other peoples) preference is a real problem.  I would much prefer that the defacto standard was removed so that any solutions they came up with in the tooling space were of necessity workflow agnostic.<p>&quot;If you had a few wishes about improving Scala in the future, what would they be and how would you implement them?&quot;<p>The single most important next step for the Scala community is to come up with an idiomatic style.  As it stands, if you open a library, go to a new company or even look at the standard libraries there is no single &quot;right&quot; way to write Scala code.  For instance, lots of effort has been expended to enable type classes in the language but you can&#x27;t use standard type classes to enable for syntax (to be honest I&#x27;d be fine with the removal of the for syntax entirely but understand that is a pretty out there proposition).  A decision around what is and is not idiomatic code and a systematic rewrite of the standard libraries to follow that code is in order.  Better yet, a program similar to Go format that just makes decisions about what is right or wrong is in order.  The XLint/future features are a good start (not withstanding the neutering that happened with procedure syntax) but I would love to see something more aggressive.<p>Finally, Typesafe the company and Scala the community need clearer boundaries.  It is troubling to me that the Akka/Play/Sbt/Slicks of the world get obvious preferential treatment when it comes to language prioritization.  If you want to do something outside the norm in any of those functional spaces, Scala becomes hard to use (and in the case of Sbt they are actually internally inconsistent).  I&#x27;d prefer a more hands off approach by the language that let the &quot;market&quot; decide the solution.",1406600984

Depreciation applies to financing a car too, but you don&#x27;t count it in addition to your principal payments. Quick smell test: if you finance a $25,000 car, by the time you&#x27;ve reduced the value to zero it will have depreciated $25,000 <i>and</i> you will have made $25,000 in car payments on the principal, but you will not have paid $50,000 total, you will have paid $25,000 plus interest. Depreciation is ultimately just &quot;take the price of the car, average it out over time&quot; with potentially some games to take into account the nonlinearity of the curve.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if $5,000/year is right, though. The car cost at least $109,000 new and probably more. At that rate it would take 21 years to fully depreciate, but the average life of a car is more like a decade. It&#x27;s nonlinear, but the car is at most six years old. I think this may be an underestimate.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, I&#x27;m struck by the maintenance figure of $3,500/year.

The attitude towards backwards compatibility is something that is heralded as amazing by many when they look to Scala.  To the point that anyone that speaks ill of it is often chided.  (As I seem to be getting here.  Note the rhetoric you are using.)<p>Going further, though, taking your own sentence, one would should probably wonder if Scala is sacrificing anything in the longevity realm by having the attitude that they have.  I do not doubt that these are deliberate choices, but they are somewhat annoying.  I&#x27;m incredibly glad that I can still run all of the code in SICP, if I want to study them.  Same for TAoCP.  Though, the latter is definitely more work than the former.<p>Regarding tex, it is annoying to see how it is often supplanted as much by people that just refuse to learn tex as it is for any technical reason.  Especially in the modern environment where aesthetics are so widely debated and built around.<p>And no, I don&#x27;t think this is unique to the programming world.  I need only look at how many ways people refuse to learn to cook eggs on the stove to know that we often try many new things that just aren&#x27;t that fruitful.  And, honestly, this is a good thing.  Rarely is any effort truly wasted.",1406599799

The kill command is still used today, but can be used to send signals to running applications aside from &quot;please exit immediately&quot;.<p>If you want to get really nitpicky, halt isn&#x27;t as absolute and precise as kill.  Halt can mean that the app&#x27;s activity is simply paused, but its resources are still held and it can in the future be resumed from its original position.  Kill very much and in no uncertain terms means to immediately terminate the execution of an application without further processing of the current task.<p>They really aren&#x27;t interchangeable terms.  If you are talking about interchangeability to an end-user who doesn&#x27;t have such knowledge, I would argue even then some users may understand the different between not using an app and actually terminating it. Such as halting a video vs closing the window. If you are looking for analogies of proof of understanding, people say to &quot;kill the engine&quot; or other mechanical devices.  So again, the term &quot;kill&quot; used in reference to terminating things isn&#x27;t that weird.<p>The individual who was surprised to hear of killing an app could have been surprised for a variety of reasons, but not in such a way that I think &quot;halt&quot; should be used over kill.",1406599401

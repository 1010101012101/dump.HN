The ratio of good-to-unfinished/poor libraries was much lower than for Ruby. It was also evident that code style/programming conventions had not solidified yet; it looked like the early stages of Ruby, where people weren't yet quite sure how to write ""rubyesque"" code. (Take a look at Ruby's standard library; it's for the most part very much out of date with ""modern style"" Ruby.)<p>I see the same kind of uncertainty with some Haskell projects, like the Text.Regex package, which I tried to figure out how to use, and failed, even with repeated google searches to find examples. The author seems to attempt at a certain ambitious programming style based on typeclasses, but since its usage is undocumented (or was, at the time I tried it ~6 months ago) you have to be a level 15 Haskell wizard to untangle its API. Similar Ruby experiments exist, and are eventually deprecated because of ""too much magic"".<p>Sure, Ruby developers create way too many projects that are never finished (or equally bad, are abandoned). But the stable of good-or-great libraries is actually very solid. Probably more so for web development than other things (Ruby doesn't have anything like Python's NumPy, for example); if you start a web project with Ruby you can get absurdly productive by just harnessing a few existing gems.",1318953326

In Haskell, vars have data types, functions have type signatures, and even type signatures have types called kinds.  A type signature is a specification of what types of parameters a function takes, and what type of result it returns.  A kind specifies how many rounds of currying a type signature requires.<p>And it gets more sophisticated from there.  Languages like Java with just mere data types are baby typed at best.  Not even remotely comparable.",1318953221

I did a post a while ago [0] that features a lot of these. Its a long list.

Weve had the power of SVG available to us for at least 5 years (except in IE), and few devs can develop using it (it's not that hard once you try, honest!).<p>The web is expanding to one of apps, where we can create native like experiences. That isnt a bad thing. It means people can pick up and use web technologies to make apps when before they would have had to use C++ or Java or whatever. Just because people can write apps on the Web though, doesn't mean there will not still be the demand for web pages, based around pages, articles and content rather than the app model. Both will stand side by side for quite a while yet.<p>And back to games. They can be made using web tech now, and that along with mobile platforms, and online stores on games consoles and the like have breathed new life into the indie development scene. It seems it is now possible for a few people in their basement to make top selling games again. These is no reason why it can't stay the same for the web too.<p>Its always better that the capabilities are there for when developers need it, than not being available at all.<p>[0] <a href=""http://dstorey.tumblr.com/post/10657722675/openwebstack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dstorey.tumblr.com/post/10657722675/openwebstack</a>",1318952902

As far as I can tell the only real difference is type erasure, so all you'd have to do is:<p>1) erase types.  All method parameters become Object, all variables become Object.<p>2) implicitly add an interface to each class for each method type ie classes with String toString(String) get an implicit interface with one method Object toString(Object).<p>3) implicitly cast from Object to the method-interface type in order to call methods.<p>That sounds pretty slow, but also not very far from Java.

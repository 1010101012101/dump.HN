There seems to be a few parallels between what Kiko attempted and how they were hosed by Google Calender and what WriteWith is attempting. <p>The difference here being WriteWith launching after GoogleDocs and it being marketed differently. Looks like WriteWith is creating a niche within collaborative doc editing, by catering to and marketing as a collaborative blogging platform. Brilliant concept! Truly catering to the long tail of bloggers!!",1176410805

Good advice, definitetly.<p>The only problem is about the language filter: we already thought about it, but now we have only one story in english, so you wouldn't have seen anything. This is one of the first things we'll fix in the next days.",1176410341

I can notify you about it, if you want to, same for c1sc0, but you'll have to give me your email address then, I guess.<p>Funny, I thought starting the international version first would be better, as I find it easier to get the word out (lots of english web 2.0 blogs and such). I have very little knowledge on how to get your site promoted in Belgium.<p>Belgian community? You're giving me an idea :) Wouldn't it be awesome to gather belgian webmasters all in 1 place (a website.. obviously), create a commmunity and call it ""Silicon Valley in Belgium"". Not that I'm going to do that, it's just a cool idea :)",1176409342

For the use case you describe, having a saved set of Firefox tabs would do a far better job.<p>Let's say you do come up with some new twist on the whole web desktop thing. There is absolutely no technological barrier to entry for that market. Any of the existing products can add on your differentiating feature in a week, and then crush you.<p>If you're working on this as a neat hack, I'm all for it, but if you think this is going to turn into a viable business somehow, I think you're probably mistaken.",1176409303

12329,comment,12328,12328,0,0,rfrey,,,"There have been some discussions here and elsewhere about how larger companies are more interested in acquiring earlier-stage startups than they used to be.  The gist is that they are beginning to cut out the VC middleman by going after promising companies before they grow too big (and expensive).<p>Is anyone aware of any data that backs this up?  I'm not sure how to present this idea to folks who aren't in tune with valley trends.",1176408910

The downside of this, of course, is that photographers who shoot in RAW would only have a JPEG copy backed up. We figured this was a reasonable compromise. In a catastrophic event, wouldn&#x27;t a photographer rather have a JPEG copy than nothing at all? It turns out the answer was no. But we didn&#x27;t ask that question, because we thought the answer was so obvious.<p>I am no photographer... but from what I can see in this thread, what people are looking for is a solution to store RAW image files.

Sometimes we have to debug things that are on the other side of the world. When we do that, we need to have a mental model of what we&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;re familiar with that as a software developer: you have a mental model of the capabilities of the language that you are using, and you are fitting that in with the mental model of the problem you are solving and the context of existing program code.<p>To sysadmins, protocols are like programming languages. That&#x27;s why we like text-based protocols: we can fit them in our heads and type them out, slowly, like ancient creaky teletypes that make lots of mistakes and pause in between commands. Meanwhile, we&#x27;re running down checklists: can we connect? OK, there&#x27;s no IP-based packet filtering. What does the banner say? Can it support STARTTLS?

6023096,comment,6021568,6022447,2,0,CleanedStar,,,"If technically Poland was under Soviet occupation, then technically Italy was under US occupation.<p>There&#x27;s much more of a case for Italy being a US satellite state than Poland being and independent state under foreign occupation.  There was no independent Poland in the century before World War I.  Only the two decades of upheaval between World War I and II allowed for some Polish independence.<p>US troops occupied Italy and are still in Italy today.  Not that those who ran the US economy disapproved of what Mussolini had been doing.  As Fortune magazine memorably said in 1934: &quot;The wops are unwopping themselves&quot;.  Plenty of US investor money went to Italy, and Mussolini even had some support in US liberal circles.  Then World War II happens.  Northern Italy, which the fascists had to work to keep down, mostly liberated itself in the days and weeks before Allied troops even arrived there.  Then in 1948 the US very openly rigged elections so the Christian Democrats would win.  Gladio was set up as a secret government in case the left was voted to power.  As late as 1976, Italian voters voted 34.4% for the communists, 9.6% for the socialists (who still had the hammer and sickle emblem), 1.5% for the ultra-left Proletarian Democracy etc.  Secret P2 lodges pulled strings at high levels, strategia della tensione was put into effect with bombings by the far right blamed on the left, with leads back to the highest levels of government.  US intelligence had a massive involvement in Italy.  It was no less a &quot;satellite state&quot; than any eastern European country.<p>Hungary was called a satellite state of the USSR even though it had had an independent communist revolution after World War I, put down by foreign intervention.  Hungary was independent of the USSR until 1956, when the right took over and announced its desire to join NATO.  England and France were invading Egypt around this time.",1373493409

You can troubleshoot SIP issues very easily using a packet inspector like ngrep (using Telnet might be a bit difficult as there are some timers that expire if you don&#x27;t respond fast enough, but that&#x27;s besides the point).<p>Then there&#x27;s a protocol like SS7 which is binary based. It&#x27;s all structure binary bit fields. Even though it&#x27;s binary based, and not very human readable, we have tools that decode the bits into a human readable format, which in turn makes it just as easy as SIP to troubleshoot.<p>The question I ask myself is, which one would be easier to implement, text based or binary format? I guess I&#x27;d lean towards text based--in fact I have implemented a SIP client myself with success. But have yet to implement any kind of SS7 or binary based protocols. Perhaps experience has something to do with it, would having experience implementing binary protocols make it any bit easier? And to be fair, SIP is also much well more documented then SS7. As well it&#x27;s easier to test SIP.<p>I&#x27;m just starting to work with binary protocols, so it will be interesting how much progress I make.

Those files could easily be as difficult to open in fifteen years as a ClarisWorks document is today (just to choose one example - proprietary formats for professional software from the late 90&#x27;s are all pretty hard to open today). Also, important metadata is kept in the lrcat file.

This will require greater awareness for the complexities involved (and the need for open file formats) from everyone from creatives to storage and service providers.<p>By the way, every creative industry is struggling with this right now.

It&#x27;s basically an offensive response to assholes: also be an asshole.<p>I think it essentially comes from the nature of the game: as an individual, you&#x27;re suddenly stuck with a bunch of other people you have to cooperate with. It&#x27;s not like tf2 or CS. The teams are smaller and the stakes are much higher. People care about winning games in DotA a lot more than they do in most FPS games, where the journey is the destination. In DotA, the win is the destination and it&#x27;s the validation of your abilities (k/d ratio doesn&#x27;t cut it).<p>You would think having the win be so important would make it easier or better to work together, but the fact of the matter is most DotA players suck. Even people who consistently win public games still suck. Players hold everyone else to incredibly high standards and get frustrated when they feel like their team &quot;drags them down.&quot; This is compounded by a feeling that, if you&#x27;re doing badly yourself, you should scapegoat a team member in order to shift the blame.<p>DotA 2 is actually a lot better. I&#x27;m not sure why exactly, and it depends on your level. Maybe there&#x27;s hope.",1373490843

An MFN provision will frequently appear in contracts between wholesalers and retailers and it ensures that the wholesaler will provide the retailer with the best wholesale price. But Apple adopted it in the agency model to require that the publishers adjust e-book prices in the iBookstore to match the lowest price offered by any other retailer — regardless of whether the publisher controlled the pricing in that retailer.<p>>This meant that the iBookstore would always have the e-book at the cheapest price. It also meant that if a retailer was offering the book for a cheaper price, the publisher would have to lower the retail price to match it. If that meant the price was below what it cost to produce, the publisher would take the loss, not Apple — they would still get their 30% cut.<p>>The traditional purpose of MFNs are used to protect a retailer’s ability to compete, ensuring that they aren’t disadvantaged by the wholesaler giving their competitors a better deal. The DOJ contends that the way this MFN works, it was designed to “protect Apple from having to compete on price at all, while still maintaining Apple’s 30 percent margin.” Those are strong words, but there is certainly a kernel of truth to that.<p><a href=""http://www.macstories.net/stories/understanding-the-agency-model-and-the-dojs-allegations-against-apple-and-those-publishers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macstories.net/stories/understanding-the-agency-m...</a>",1373490599

They&#x27;re assuming that there&#x27;s a &quot;market&quot; of investors who are both interested in and willing to diversify their investment portfolio by, in part, making smaller high risk investments.  My experience with, admittedly smaller investment firms,  is that this may be true.  Organizations like IllinoisVENTURES (I know several of the folks there) aren&#x27;t interested in big C-round investments. The bulk of their information comes from their proximity (physically and virtually) to Enterprise Works (a UIUC run incubator).  I&#x27;ve heard partners declare, on several occasions, &quot;I wish we knew about these guys while they were still looking for seed money.&quot;  I guess in, at least one, anecdotal case, it does bear out to be true.<p>As for my bar, let me re-phrase, just for accuracy:  We couldn&#x27;t come close on our own without liquidating existing investments.  It didn&#x27;t make mathematical sense to do so (returns were higher on existing than expected returns on the bar).  From our perspective, it was an expensive hobby, not a money making investment (for us).<p>On the other hand, if we could raise, let&#x27;s say $50K from investment, $50K converted from other investments (our own money), and $25K from family, then cover the remaining $75K through bank loan collateralized by the building (the building is valued at $125k)...

I am happy to share what we have learned in the past 2 years. www.mosaicarchive.com<p>As a background, we now have thousands of users and customers. We also finished raising a series A in February. (Not that raising money proves anything) <a href=""http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/02/mosaic_storage_systems_collect.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2013/02/mo...</a><p>We are now growing at about 5%-7% a week. We recently peaked in the top 100 grossing US iPad Photo/Video Apps in iOS - although most of our revenue comes outside of iOS. (As they take a 30% cut.)<p>We target serious photographers (pro&#x27;s and prosumers) who use Adobe Lightroom. For pure backup customers our sweet spot are those who have outgrown BackBlaze and Crashplan. (Both great services but geared at consumers.)<p>On the backup side, we help photographers manage their backups by using Adobe Lightroom metadata. Customers can choose to backup everything in Lightroom automatically. However, many photographers use metadata like stars or flags to designate their best photos. We allow users to automatically backup these &quot;best&quot; photos. This provides the automation of the best backup tools with more precision for larger customers.<p>We use Amazon Glacier behind the scenes to store the original photos. (Yes, WMF the restoration costs even out for us over all of our users.) (Sidebar - we actually ran our data center for months before switching to Glacier...very glad to have made the switch.)<p>However... we are not an online backup company. Online backup is a feature is our service... but not the entirety of it.<p>Once we have have photographers photos, we also want to help photographers better use, manage, share, and enjoy those photos. At one point I would have said we are a backup company, now I call us a workflow company.<p>We also offer a web and iOS App to privately view and share your Lightroom photos. (We take JPG snapshots of the RAW files so they load quickly and have the Lightroom edits. This part of the service runs in Amazon S3 not Glacier) This gives you access to your photos in the same way you are used to experiencing them in Lightroom. (Lightroom users try this for free - <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mosaic-archive/id627973694?ls=1&mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mosaic-archive/id627973694?l...</a>)<p>The next step which we are working on now is adding two-way sync where you can manage your photos in the App and it populates back to your desktop files and Lightroom. We are also working on more collaborative features so photographers can share this culling and editing process with their clients or family members.<p>The bigger problem we are solving is that photographers have loads of large files... backing them up is painful yes... but managing them all is more painful. Sifting through 000s of images to find your best stuff frankly stinks. This problem is only getting bigger as we shoot more and more.<p>For those interested in this idea, please consider joining us. We are hiring a couple more software developers this year. <a href=""http://www.mosaicarchive.com/about-mosaic-photo-storage/careers/software-engineer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mosaicarchive.com/about-mosaic-photo-storage/care...</a><p>Thanks for the discussion and happy to answer all questions.<p>Best, Gerard\nwww.mosaicarchive.com",1373490158

Imagine a scenario where an ambulance arrives as a first responder, and the EMTs [1] find that they cannot gain access to the emergency scene, because the home or other structure is locked or otherwise blocked. In this case, a firetruck would need to be dispatched, because it deploys with the correct equipment (e.g., Halligan bar [2], Denver tool [3], etc.) and personnel trained to handle such a situation. Also, ambulances are typically deployed with only two personnel, and that may not be enough in situations where items need to be moved or cleared to gain clear access to the emergency scene.<p>2. Most firefighters are cross-trained as EMTs. If they are local to the emergency scene, then they may be the first responders, while an ambulance is en-route.<p>3. Incoming 911 calls can often be confusing, with callers under extreme stress, experiencing situations that they have never faced in their lives. Imagine a situation where a caller is so distraught, overwhelmed, or focused on a life-saving effort, that they cannot articulate that they need firefighting support, in addition to an ambulance.<p>The bottom line: in an emergency situation, it is better to have more help on-hand than too little.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halligan_bar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halligan_bar</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_tool"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_tool</a>",1373490054

Necessary backstory: regular Fancy Feast comes in two categories of textures: Classic which is a pâté style, and everything else (Flaked, Grilled, Sliced...) which is anything but. Our cat exclusively eats non-pâté food. So we order a 24 can box of flaked/grilled/sliced beef+poultry or seafood, and what shows up at the door?

Taking the data at face value it’s even doubtful whether the browser ballot had any effect at all.<p>StatCounter shows a pretty steady decline of IE since July 2008 (that’s when their data starts), down to about 45% in March 2010 (that’s the month when the browser ballot came with a Windows update) from about 58% (that’s about 0.6% per month). Since March IE has lost 7.8 points (that’s about 0.8% per month). All that loss since March was at the expense of Chrome (Firefox and other browsers could merely hold their March level).<p>That decline was a bit more rapid than the past average, but that extended decline is nothing special and also not particularly steep (there have been eleven month of near constant decline between August 2008 and June 2009 at an average rate of about 1.1% per month).<p>Firefox had more than 36% of the browser share since December 2008. The browser ballot doesn’t seem to have helped it so at least Firefox is in the position it is without any help from the EU. Chrome might have been helped by the ballot but even that is doubtful. North America which didn’t get a browser ballot shows a similar rise of Chrome.<p>A superficial reading of the data doesn’t show any effects of the browser ballot. You might be able to tease effects out with more analysis but I would bet that those are miniscule.",1294189198

I have so far considered the crappy Market to be a result of Google's internal algorithmic-search-is-better-than-human-editing approach, and their lateness to the game, and their subpar graphics performance for developers, and the comparatively poor UI culture at Google.<p>Given all these complaints, it's amazing there's a market at all!<p>If his take is true, then the worst thing the Android team did last year was screw up the patent situation on iAds. Mobile ads truly suck right now, the same sort of UI re-think that Google did in the late 1990s for web ads needs to be done on the mobile platform.

Most people do not realize how much of the messiness comes from the <i>problem</i> and not the <i>protocol</i>. IM's easy, right? Just message here, message there? Yeah, sure, the <i>first</i> iteration of IM in the mid-1990s was. File transfers are easy, right? Yes, when both clients and the server are on the same LAN they're trivial. On the real Internet? No, actually they're quite hard. Conferences are no sweat, right? If you're hacking together a Node.js demo that simply shovels out messages to everyone in the conference with no further features, sure. If you want like <i>features</i> and stuff in some sort of standard way, it gets harder. And so on. I'm not saying it's perfect in every way, in particular the oldest parts of the protocol are a bit crufty (like the overloading of the presence tag to mean too many things), but there's a lot of people who rag on it for really misguided reasons, or who failed to read the core standard and got tripped up on the connection process. (In fact, there's a lot of people who don't even spend enough time on it to realize that the standard <i>is</i> modularized and you don't have to take every piece for every purpose.)<p>If I were designing it from scratch today, yes it would be a JSON datagram protocol. But XMPP is many years older than JSON as a distinct thing.",1294189145

Google could, of course, just extend their search advertising to mobile phones, Adsense for mobile devices and build mobile versions of their web applications so anyone can use them. That might make for a fine business, but it’d also be a rather weak position to be in compared to where Google is now. Phone makers could change the default search engine on their phones to something other than Google; mobile devices might change how people find information—they might switch away entirely from using a search engine, and in that case, Google would be dead in the water; or, worse, perhaps mobile devices could move people away from using advertising-supported web applications, and toward primarily using paid-for applications; in that case, Google would really be screwed.</i><p>---<p>The thing is, Bing is already the default search on many phones, including Android/Droid phones on Verizon, who is ostensibly Google's partner.",1294188799

I'm disputing the fact that he doesn't think that.

They then trade that attention for money in the case of Ads<p>So Google does compete with iOS.  The only difference is they're deriving value differently (one directly from payment the other from Ads).<p>But if someone buys an iPhone they aren't seeing the Ads Google's trying to deliver through Android and if someone buys an Android phone Apple isn't getting that person's money.

2069249,comment,2068764,2069008,0,0,dkarl,,,"<i>If you can comment, I would be interested on the standard of coding that successful candidates exhibit once employed.</i><p>Good ones write good code; the ones we shouldn't have hired write poor code or don't code at all.  As for how to tell the difference, I pay a lot of attention to candidates' questions, comments, and attitude while writing code.  That part carries over pretty directly to how they do their real job and how pleasant they are to work with.  As for quality of code, my rough impression is that the more meaningful details they take care of in their whiteboard code, the more productive they are.  Getting syntax and library function names right or wrong doesn't tell you much (except how recently they wrote code that used that syntax or those functions) but getting other details right does matter.<p>Which details matter is a matter of judgment.  My attitude is that some errors are trivial but should be corrected if attention is called to them.  For example, off-by-one errors in array indices are easy to miss on a whiteboard if they only affect one line of code or just make the output a little incorrect -- that's no big deal -- but when a candidate gets stuck or confused because of an off-by-one error he made a few lines up, he should be able to figure it out, correct the error, and correct any related errors.<p>Good things to watch out for (besides asking good questions to make sure the problem is well specified):<p>1.  The candidate doesn't start writing a complete solution without having a decent idea where it's going.  If he doesn't see a solution immediately, he takes some time to understand the problem, possibly working an example by hand, sketching out possible solutions, or talking through the problem verbally.<p>2.  The candidate draws logical inferences about his own code.  ""Oops, this function signature is wrong, because in these two cases the same arguments are passed, but the output needs to be different.  I need to pass in more information.""<p>3.  If the candidate takes the wrong path, he backs up as far as necessary to get back on the right track.  He reminds himself of the problem statement and reevaluates his decisions up to that point.<p>Bad things to watch out for (besides having a bad attitude or failing to ask questions):<p>1.  The candidate launches right into coding a solution without understanding how the problem can be solved.  (Those candidates usually end up boxing themselves in, so they really better be good at backing up and starting fresh.)<p>2.  The candidate spends a long time trying to impossible code, such as trying to implement the body of a function when the arguments he has specified for it don't contain enough information.<p>3.  If the candidate takes the wrong path, he doesn't back up far enough to recover.  For example, he doesn't question anything he decided more than five minutes ago, so he starts to treat his initial steps in solving the problem as if they were part of the problem statement.  (I have seen the opposite mistake also, where a candidate encounters a problem that is clearly local to a small part of his code, but he interprets it as invalidating his whole approach.  That mistake is usually just a mistake; people are going to make mistakes under pressure.  It doesn't show a lack of intellectual flexibility like the opposite behavior.  Depending on the circumstances I <i>might</i> interpret it as a lack of persistence, but usually not.)",1294187609

2069182,comment,2068764,2069122,0,0,strlen,,,"Using a ""magic marker"" like this doesn't imply looking at a raw memory dump (which, however, is still needed in several places Google is involved e.g., kernel hacking, embedded devices). For example, I used it myself when debugging an issue where our processes morphed into un-killable zombies. I was dealing with crash dumps, where I was walking through the process list in the kernel (it's a doubly linked list) in crash/gdb (looking at kernel memory dump obtained via netdump from a production server that manifest this condition) so I could find a process that has acquired a specific lock to test whether a theory that I had was true. I wasn't (and still am not) at Google and I don't even claim to have any expertise in actual kernel development: it was a bug a customer was experiencing and it needed to be fixed.<p>Lastly (and I am completely going on a limb here, without any concrete information), this could also be used to gauge team/culture fit Google. This is a good way to see if you'll be a fit for a team that spends a huge amount of time finding and fixing low-level bugs: it's fun to read about infrastructure that Google has built, but the actual process of building it may be very frustrating to some. Not being a fit for such a group doesn't imply rejection, it could simply mean you're brought back to a different round with another set of people.",1294186206

Given that there are a large number of both companies and non-profit organisations requiring CAs, none of which require a postal copy, it cannot be rationally argued that this is a legal requirement unless you are also willing to argue that all of those other companies are failing to show due diligence; I don't believe that argument would have any merit. Since Clojure has that requirement, the most plausible reason is that it is an attempt to erect as large a barrier as possible to participation (and the only other reason I can think up is that Rich Hickey is a paranoid of the tinfoil hat variety, but I've seen no other evidence of that). I cannot overstate enough how large a barrier this is; even those corporate OSS projects widely condemned for their failure at understanding the open source ideal (I've already mentioned Android; another example might be OpenOffice, most of whose developers recently decided enough was enough and jumped ship) don't make it this hard.

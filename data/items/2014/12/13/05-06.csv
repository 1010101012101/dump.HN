Lots of the display advertisements that appear on the web are served via these ad networks. Many of these connections are not encrypted and, as you probably know, if a single image on the page is not encrypted it jeopardizes the security of the connection. To maintain the integrity of the connection, the nonsecure networks are eliminated from the bidding process. Fewer bidders, lower final value.",1418450315

For higher ups you need lots of ambition, vision, sense of mission, independence, intrinsic motivation and persistence. Most companies just want their employees to be able to &quot;get work done&quot; and they usually believe that management chain aka &quot;leadership&quot; would bring other qualities to the table. It&#x27;s considered as management&#x27;s job to figure out what the big problems are, break it down to tasks, make schedules, monitor progress and so on. if ads had a problem at Yahoo, for example, CEO might go to VP and ask him to fix it and then VP rolls this down the chain. The book says that Google breaks the mold here. Instead of CEO going to VP and management eventually assigning tasks to someone, he expected employees to just get up and take an action out of disgust and violation of sense of their mission.<p>One &quot;issue&quot; is that these kind of people don&#x27;t like to be &quot;managed&quot;. They generally don&#x27;t want someone telling what they should be doing, track their status and so on. This was the reason Google used to had managers with 30-100 reports. One intended effect was that managers would be forced to interfere less with their reports and not be able to look over engineers shoulders or decide for them what exactly they should be doing. At most other companies it is unimaginable to have that many reports because the very first question people would ask is how would one manager can keep track of what everyone is doing? These companies inherently are designed to attract category 1. There is exponential difference in outcomes between each of above listed categories.",1418448729

If you look at males in the general public, very few of them would actually be considered a &#x27;power user&#x27; or higher.<p>I disagree, and think that adults who grew up before computers were commonplace are skewing your perception. I was a teenager not too long ago, and as I remember it, personal computer ownership was about even between the sexes in middle class youth, perhaps even biased towards girls a bit because &quot;a boy will just use it for porn.&quot; In spite of this, pretty almost every young boy I knew that had a computer, whether or not they were really a &quot;computer person&quot; or grew up to do anything related to technology, was interested in tinkering with their computers in <i>some</i> way. From playing games for long hours, tweaking their configs or even making maps or modding the game, running their own game servers from their desktop (Minecraft is especially popular for this today), to having the spiffiest desktop and theme, to building their own PCs, hanging out on forums/irc channels/etc. and the good ol&#x27; fashioned standby of amassing a huge collection of pirated music, movies, and pornography, there were a lot of opportunities for otherwise &quot;normal&quot; boys to get experience in playing with computers and learning something about them along the way. Being good with computers could even be somewhat cool, in a &quot;you&#x27;re a fucking wizard, dude&quot; kind of way. And to be clear, this is the perception I got from hanging out with kids on all levels of the social spectrum, not just super computer dorks like myself.<p>In contrast, most of the girls I knew used them mostly for IMing friends. The most &quot;hardcore&quot; girls I knew were involved in communities themselves like Deviantart or the various MMOs, which gave them plenty of their own opportunities to play and learn (for instance, Photoshop is a very complicated program, and sites like Neopets and MySpace taught basic HTML to a lot more girls than boys), but in general a larger proportion of the girls seemed more interested in study, their personal lives, relationships, and &quot;drama&quot; (the &quot;dickhead teenaged boys&quot; I mentioned in another post ITT would blush at the shit that girls do to each other), than in the computer itself or the internet outside of their &quot;small world.&quot; I&#x27;m not a girl, though, so obviously I don&#x27;t have the whole story.<p>With the younger generations, the situation looks similar to me, but with smart phones. It&#x27;s common and &quot;cool&quot; for a guy to have a rooted/jailbroken phone, get a buttload of apps for free, and customize the crap out of his phone. But while I obviously don&#x27;t have much contact with teenaged girls nowadays outside of family, the ones I have talked with are more interested in instagramming and snapchatting with their friends than the phones themselves.<p>People often say that women naturally have more emotional and social intelligence on average than men, so I don&#x27;t really get why those same people get offended by the idea that men could naturally have more more &quot;systems intelligence&quot; or general interest in tinkering than women on average.",1418448559

Maybe they didn&#x27;t always get the best grades in school, but as early as middle or high school they could blow you away with the knowledge they gained purely out of self interest. This group is mostly (though not entirely) male. Most (not all, though things are a <i>lot</i> better today than the used to be) of the bear&#x27;s earliest experiences with computers were solitary endeavors free of gender bias; if you&#x27;re the elementary school kid picking out computer books from the library and pouring over them at home, you aren&#x27;t even <i>aware</i> of a gender bias or skew in tech, you&#x27;re in your own little world. Sure, when you grow up a bit and start meeting i.e. dickhead teenaged boys in IRC channels, the skew makes itself known, but if you made it to that point in the first place, a few jerks aren&#x27;t going to be enough to scare you out of your passion. Given that there seems to be a <i>lot</i> more male bears than female bears, this and other anecdotal evidence suggests to me that there could be some kind of unavoidable neurological difference that makes men <i>on average</i> more likely to be innately interested in this sort of thing from a young age. We can make things more welcoming for the female bears and attempt to insulate them from the aforementioned dickhead teenagers (though I don&#x27;t think that is great idea either), but you can&#x27;t just <i>force</i> any girl into becoming a programmer any more than you can guarantee that every boy with a computer will use it for programming instead &quot;wasting&quot; it on video games and porn.<p>The foxes are the honor roll students that worked their asses off in school so that they could get into good colleges, get a good degree, get a good job, and continue their family&#x27;s upward mobility. Whether it&#x27;s business, medicine, law, or today computer programming, they didn&#x27;t really care so much about <i>what</i> they did and didn&#x27;t really worry too much about it as children (though of course they probably developed genuine interests in their field of choice during study and employment), but whatever they decided to do, they were willing to work hard to become good at it. They are at a bit of a disadvantage in tech vs. other fields that mostly lack a group of self-interested bears, but their strong work ethic helps to make up for it. This group pretty much already has gender parity (when you look at college graduates <i>as a whole,</i> not just in tech-related fields), so while the programming foxes may be made up of less women today, it will surely reach gender parity in time.<p>(Yes, this is a false dichotomy; many people can be described by both the bear and the fox. Ignore it for now, or treat it as a suggestion that the foxes may come close to but never reach true gender parity either.)<p>Any tech company is going to be made up of both bears and foxes. The proportions of these groups will vary, and the gender ratio within both groups will slowly shift closer to gender parity over time as barriers are torn down. However, if you accept that there may be a natural reason for the bears to be made up of more men than women, then it becomes clear that due to the bears tipping the scales, there will <i>never</i> be perfect gender parity in tech candidates, and that there can only be perfect gender parity in <i>employed</i> tech workers if the male bears are actively discriminated against by all potential employers. Sadly this philosophy does not seem to be very far off from what many employers and prominent figures here seem to actually believe and practice, but on the bright side for the male bears, it is almost impossible for them to be completely excluded; for as long as tech is a competitive field, ignoring a male worker because of his gender will just result in him being snatched up by someone else.<p>So while I do support initiatives to reduce gender bias and punish <i>blatant</i> harassment in tech, I think that <i>some</i> amount of gender skew is unavoidable and not worth worrying about. The people that push for a perfect 50/50 split strike me as misguided at best (if you disagree with the idea that men could be &quot;better&quot; or more interested on average at tinkering as a whole, while simultaneously believing that women are &quot;better&quot; on average with emotional and social skills, then while I see where you&#x27;re coming from, I think you have some cognitive dissonance to work through), and at worst, far left radicals and those they dupe, more interested in raging a never-ending culture war than in making any real progress.<p>But hey, as a bear, I&#x27;m biased.",1418447600

It would be nice to get feedback.<p>I recently applied for a junior software engineer position with Crytek(Germany).<p>As a first line of assessment they had given me a coding test to be completed within a week, the HR lady gets back to me after a day to tell me that I have only 2 days to complete it. No big deal, as I had already completed it the same day, I submit it.<p>Next after a couple of days, I was asked to attend an international telephonic interview with 4 senior programmers. Unfortunately for the interview, there were some technical problems from their side which resulted in a telephone call where I could hear their conversation but they could not hear me.<p>Shockingly, as they were trying to fix the problem for an hour without realizing that I could hear them, I overhead them making racial jokes/taunts at me.<p>Without giving any further thought to what just had happened, I emailed the HR to request a re-schedule of the interview but I have still not received any reply. I am thinking they might have dropped my application for the fact that it maybe too much hard work for them to assess me.<p>what I would like to know from those of you who may have a lot of experience in the industry, is this something common, that one should expect when you interview in the gaming industry regardless of the company being an AAA games developer.<p>To be honest, I was shocked and appalled by the lack of professional courtesy.",1418447392

You have to willingly forgo tens of thousands of dollars for the pleasure of working. Since trying even just a little bit disqualifies you. And yes, SSI/SSDI eats your soul.<p>But the argument stands even without SSI/SSDI though. Just adding ACA on top of the existing subsidies was enough to almost completely eliminate the incentive to work for practically half of Americans! (median household income: $53,891)<p>> you can&#x27;t count payroll taxes as lost income, because they contribute to your future social security benefit.<p>If only that were literally true!! As usual, a tiny little bit of work each year contributes a lot to your benefits. Everything above that contributes ~1/8th as much. See: <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10070.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10070.pdf</a><p>I&#x27;ll summarize: Take your annual earnings each year (up to the FICA max for that year), and adjust for inflation. Take the 35 highest earnings years, and sum them, then divide by 420 (35 * 12). The result is &quot;Step 4&quot;. Now look at Step 5:<p>5a. Multiply the first $816 in Step 4 by 90%.  5b. Multiply the amount in Step 4 over $816 and less than or equal to $4,917 by 32%. 5c. Multiply the amount in Step 4 over $4,917 by 15%. Step 6. Sum the three to find your benefit!<p>Do you see what they did there?! This is nuts! What does this actually all mean? The net effect?<p><pre><code>  15.6% * $10k *  35 = $ 54,600 of FICA taxes ==>  $  816/mo in benefits (5.5yrs till breakeven)\n  15.6% * $120k * 35 = $655,200 of FICA taxes ==>  $2,642/mo in benefits (20 yrs till breakeven)\n</code></pre>\nTL;DR - With Social Security, paying 12x the premium nets you at most 3.2x the benefits. The highest payers would need 20 years of benefits just to get their money back, and that&#x27;s with no ROI / compound interest.<p>Plug $20,000 (it&#x27;s a bit more than current-day maximum FICA) per year savings for the next 35 years at even <i>4% ARR</i> into a calculator... the day you retire you should be looking at $1.35 million dollars in your savings account. At 8% ARR (S&P500) the balance would be $2.8 million.<p>But they&#x27;ll pay you inflation-adjusted $2,600 / month. About 1% annually on your 2.8 million. It&#x27;s. A. Scam. $18,000 / month would be a respectable ROI on that level of investment. In other words, the vast majority of that up to $655k <i>is effectively lost</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not tracking inflation, but since the Wage Base tracks inflation, and payout as well, I can make the point without adding that complexity.<p>It&#x27;s like a disease ridden throughout the tax code. The progressive nature is literally everywhere, and it&#x27;s all designed to apply more and more pressure the more money you make. The problem is, it&#x27;s all additive, and there are so many layers...",1418447114

64918,comment,63009,63009,0,0,earcaraxe,,,"This essay definitely gives me a sense of fear and dread. What Paul makes out to be a good thing, really gives me a nasty reaction. Startups becoming ubiquitous? If startups really become so prevalent, I feel like it's not necessarily worth doing. Aren't there only so many things that web startups can do? I'm afraid of startups becoming ""the cool thing to do,"" for students in technical fields. College starting to game students specifically for working on startups. 1000 applications, 10000 applications, it stops becoming novel, it feels like a sellout.

64914,comment,64839,64839,0,0,amalcon,,,"Not being a biologist, add a grain of salt and all that, but...<p>Of course not!  It's just not even remotely feasible.  There are two reasons, but I'll start with the big one.<p>We have shown a marked inability to micromanage ""changing human nature for the better.""  We just don't understand enough about the brain to make e.g. violent criminals stop being violent, using psychology, drugs, surgery, or anything else really.  See any crime statistics you like on the subject.  The one exception is wherein we can stop someone from being violent, by basically stopping them from doing anything -- not a desirable outcome as applied to the entire human population.<p>The second reason it's not feasible is, well...  What happens to the one guy who finds out about this, and spends a year in his basement becoming completely immune to the vector?   People are resistant to gene therapy vectors from time to time, with no deliberate action.  Deliberate action just makes this scenario more likely.<p>Eliminating violence is a nice sentiment, but this methodology is just not even remotely feasible.  Ethics are a whole other can of worms.",1191868571

I did a consulting gig once in the same office complex as them, and I had better luck getting an issue fixed by asking random smokers out front of their building if they could change something for me than I did calling their support number and going through the escalation procedures.

Whatever happened to growing a company slowly, based on the profits coming in? Oh, that's right - we don't do this in the tech industry because everyone says it won't work.<p>That's just a bunch of bunk. Nothing was funnier during Web 1.0 than guys saying we were ""rewriting"" the rules of business - like, profits didn't matter. Truth is, from a business point of view, starting a web service is no different than starting a dry cleaners: give people what they want, at a reasonable price (in our business, that usually means ad-supported)... and they'll come back (and click on ads in the process).<p>Yes, it may take some technical innovation... but it doesn't take any <i>business</i> innovation. Everything you say in your essay is true; so seriously, why do I need you? You expect me to go through this whole dance to come to Cambridge for, what, the possibility of <i>five-thousand bucks</i>? And then move to SilCon for three months so you can keep tabs on us once a week? Like, are you <i>serious</i>?!<p>Your essay is particularly prescient because you might have inadvertently predicted the ultimate demise of your current  business - i.e., venture funding. No, I won't fill out your form; no, I won't travel to Cambridge for the possibility for you to give me five-thousand bucks. No, I won't move to the Valley so you can keep tabs on what I'm doing. I'm a big boy, and I can take care of this end myself, thanks. Good luck with giving away your cash.<p>James Touchi-Peters, Founder/CEO

I found out about my outage from them, and they were already working to resolve the issue. I think I was down for about 30 minutes total in the middle of the night on a Wednesday, so it wasn't a big deal at all. ",1191868255

Then I was suggested to buy a new hard drive to rescue data. Then I was suggested to pay them $150 fee to swap drives. After few calls to their sales support and wasting several hours talking with them and waiting for their decisions the fee was waived. After all, three days later I got my data.
They are cheap, but when you're in trouble, you're in trouble.

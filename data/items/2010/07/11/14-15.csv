I recall similar criticism of Jimmy Wales. Wales acts like a rock star and he, like Assange, is a master fundraiser and aficionado of private jets. Despite mass defections of editors, and the enduring pompousness of Mr. Wales, Wikipedia is better than ever. Sometimes a greasy-haired, eccentric diva is the best person to represent your cause.",1278860347

According to the article, the Greek roots of ""nostaligia"" mean ""an old wound.""  I think that's very appropriate.  I get the same background feeling from this commercial that I get from watching the first part of Pixar's ""Up.""  I'd love to see a cinematographer's analysis of both of those pieces.",1278860116

While searching for more information on Cooper and Last of the Mohicans, I kept running into criticism of him by Twain. Twain said his grammar sucked and that he attributed romantic and ethical qualities to Native Americans which they simply didn't have, because they were entirely blood-thirsty savages.<p>Twain seemed like quite the jackass for those remarks, especially since I found Last of the Mohicans to be very readable and his portrayal of the Mohicans to be very interesting as contrasted to the European characters in the book. One such passage remarks that the Chief and his son, after considering new information, turned their whole plan on a dime, exhibiting the type of inconsistent behavior that would sink the career of a western politician.",1278858900

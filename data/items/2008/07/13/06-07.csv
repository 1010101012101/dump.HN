If what you're licensing is literally just ""the algorithm"" as opposed to an implementation of the algorithm that you write, than I don't see how you can get around telling them ""the math behind the algo"".",1215932341

Their search engine could also just have been a proof-of-concept, used as a demo in selling PageRank to another firm.<p>You should investigate patents (preferably with a patent attorney), and figure out just how easy it would be to reverse-engineer your algorithm.<p>Keep in mind that many programmers find the idea of secret algorithms distasteful. Hiding these processes is often a necessary evil in order to make profit, but do not do it if you don't have to (recent example: reddit).",1215932212

In politics, if you can trick people into believe rubbish X causes trash Y which leads to bullshit Z and make money off it, then that's what you do. Generally, it's best to have a semi-reasonable argument. In the case above, the flaw is in the statement ""Men and women are equal"", which is obviously not the case. (Nothing is equal to anything, except in pure mathematics.)<p>Really, saying ""men and women are equal"" is a moral statement, with built-in failure, like the commands in the sermon on the mount.

Whereas the ""small ISVs"" he writes about are just ordinary small businesses that happen to write software</i> is more a justification of your own prejudices than reality.  For every Google, there's a Microsoft, or an Adobe.<p>Software as a Service, and plain old ISV application software can both scale immensely.  I do not need to hire extra bodies if I'm selling 1 million copies a day of my app than if I'm selling 10 copies.  The only thing stopping an ISV from growing is the popularity of the software, just as the only thing stopping a Service from growing is popularity of their webapp.  In neither case there is no roadblock to growth caused by a lack of resources.<p>ISV != small.

One algo is an addon for search engines. The data generate by the algo improves usability of the search engine. Its not a ranking system. Just a taxonomy addon on top of othe ranking system that groups terms as required. Example: searching for 'gates', would generate the topics related to gates. Results will be precise as:<p>'gates' as in bill gates and microsoft<p>'gates' as in house<p>The other algo is just still a crappy 'basic stuff' stage.

I'm pretty sure the numbers play this out, but I think lower bounds on achievement tend to be heavily skewed by 'nurture'. Also, this assumes a symmetric curve.

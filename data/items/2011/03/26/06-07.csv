2371502,comment,2371006,2371248,5,0,samdk,,,"I'm not sure if it's where the 'param: Type' idiom is where it came from originally, but its use in Mirah almost certainly descended from its use in Haskell and ML. Scala also uses it, and its use there is definitely ML/Haskell-inspired. (Haskell technically is 'param :: Type', since ':' is the <i>cons</i> operator, but it's basically the same thing.)<p>Since languages like Haskell and ML (and Scala, to a lesser extent) do type inference, type annotations are often unnecessary, and so having the type listed after the name probably makes more sense in that context: what's important is the name, and variable-specific type hints are usually there for the compiler, not the human reader. The exception is functions, which very often get type definitions just because it's very helpful to have that information as a human. Since ML/Haskell-like languages have multiple function definitions and rely on pattern matching, the postfix type notation fits in very well:<p><pre><code>    func :: type1 -> type2\n    func a = ...\n    func b = ...</code></pre>",1301120308

There's also a concurrent CS 120 class that is basically a standard C course.<p>Unfortunately the Assembly scares off a lot of people from looking at the Computer Engineering degree, as does the very minimal breadboard wiring they have to do, since they assume that's all CE students do. It's a tradeoff of getting more people for a degree program vs. starting off low level. Why do you think so many schools teach Java or C# and never touch an assembly? If your school has to justify keeping a program alive, they're going to have to make it more appealing to a larger audience which unfortunately means creating an easier program or first few semesters, and targeting big-industry popular languages so you can keep subtly hinting at potential good jobs on graduation.",1301120099

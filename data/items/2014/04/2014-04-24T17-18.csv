But the conclusion does not have to be that. It would be good, for example, if cellphones could deliver rapid and accurate geolocation data specifically when the cellphone had initiated a call to a known emergency number.",1398362378
7641800,comment,7640074,7641741,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"An argument that research into curing mortality is somehow immoral based on overpopulation or limited resources directly suggests that it&#x27;s better for people to <i>die</i> than for us to have those problems.  I seriously doubt that was the intent of the argument, but that&#x27;s the implication of such an argument.  If my response sounded absurd, it&#x27;s because making the argument was absurd to begin with.<p>Now, if someone wants to look into those other problems too, that&#x27;s fine; in particular, we do need research into solutions for other causes of suffering, not just mortality, and resource shortage is a fine place to start.  But complaining about research into mortality is ridiculous.  Doubly so because such an argument assumes fungibility of research resources: the people doing that research are not arbitrarily repurposable towards other issues.<p>The rest of your post seems like an unrelated red herring combined with a vague attack.",1398362361

I&#x27;ve not been near an university in the last decade (I hated my time there as a student, I leave them alone now), but I need access to some papers for my personal projects. I resort to begging people in the academic field to send me papers, you can&#x27;t pay 45€ a paper you don&#x27;t even know if it will be useful, I read 10s of them. And, even worse, this high price doesn&#x27;t even pays the authors. A music album costs 10€ and the author gets all his money out of it plus you can listen to it on youtube to decide before buying.<p>Academics tend to cite papers for completely different reasons than for implementation, but you don&#x27;t know if a paper will be useful for implementation or not from the title.<p>edit: and I couldn&#x27;t find an option in scholar.google.com to filter only the free to view articles.",1398362292

7641759,comment,7638904,7640901,0,0,pjbrunet,,,"Can a low-res digital image really capture Warhol&#x27;s unique gestural moves?  I won&#x27;t even go there but my personal opinion is Warhol was more a conceptual artist who just happened to be &quot;on the scene&quot; in NY around the time modern art was on the way out and post-modern (more conceptual) was on the way in.<p>I&#x27;m more passionate about modern art, which I think is more in line with the &quot;refined aesthetic choices&quot; you&#x27;re talking about. I think Warhol was better known for his ideas, he just happened to know how to draw/paint to execute what was on his mind.  I can&#x27;t read your mind but your &quot;random scribbles&quot; comment caught my attention.  Not speaking to you specifically, but I think with the right teacher anyone can see there&#x27;s more to so-called random scribbles aka abstract art.  Even the nutty Jackson Pollock who made his own rules, I got to respect he trained under Thomas Hart Benton, etc.<p>I think most American universities teaching drawing/painting (fine art) today, the professors are students of students of students of Hans Hoffman (directly or indirectly) who was himself a student of Picasso, Matisse and other undeniably talented giants.  Personally, not a huge fan of Hoffman&#x27;s work but if I had a time machine, I would want to be there in one of his classes.  I don&#x27;t think the secrets are closely guarded, it&#x27;s more like esoteric nuance.  If you read old graphic design books, you&#x27;ll find some of the concepts underpinning great abstract paintings.  If I find time, maybe I&#x27;ll post YouTube videos explaining how to see abstract art through the eyes of an artist.<p>Warhol might have agreed with you.  I believe he started out drawing ads.  He was definitely thinking about commercial popularity throughout his career. I think \n&quot;popularity&quot; was the subject of much of his art.  Maybe because he felt so unpopular early in his life/career.  I think most artists would tell you, the best art is not concerned with commercial popularity, but that&#x27;s debatable I suppose.  I believe the truly great &quot;random scribbles&quot; reach toward truths and concepts that can&#x27;t be expressed well with words, or the words may not yet exist.",1398361848

However, many people have felt betrayed when using Facebook.<p>Some of it — potentially the majority of cases — have to do with the fact that the service is new, and the lack of understanding led to many context collapses: there are many situations to consider, but all involve three people knowing each other, one having authority over a second, but not a third. Classic case involve a teenage child, a parent and a common friend or relative. The relative reveals inadvertently something. This is far more disempowering to non-users mentioned by friends, or whose photo was taken.<p>Facebook was openly careless about those cases, manu legitimate — Mark Zuckerberg went up to publicly justify his disregard by saying that people shouldn’t have things to hide to their friends, a callous statement if there is any.<p>There are many more problematic cases, where the person feeling betrayed was attentive and knowledgable, but Facebook changed the way they handle privacy without clear warning, and something that wasn’t became visible. This is the case of profile pictures, for instance. You have important social information there; some people assumed that their photo with their significant other would remain as private as their set it, but that changed, without recourses. There are many more similar issues, related to poor explanations of updates.<p>There is no way the wordings chose for most updates came form considerate product managers.<p>There are more examples, generally to the overall attitude: ‘better ask for foregiveness than permission’, rephrased as (and plastered all over their headquarter as essential values): “Move fast, break things”. When it comes to privacy, you can’t get the cat back in the bag.<p>Company motto, public statements by the Founder-CEO, presentation of privacy-impacting updates… that’s plenty of proof for who would take five minutes to care looking.<p>I know for a fact that people at Facebook care about those — just they haven’t cared enough, repeatedly; and those cases where well documented.",1398361707

Okay, the stupidest thing ever. If anyone should like space solar power, it should be me. I got a rocket company and a solar company. I should be really on it, ya know. But it&#x27;s like, super obviously, not going to work because, ya know, if you have solar panels - first of all, it has to be better than having solar panels on Earth, so then you say, okay, solar panel is on-orbit, you get twice the solar energy - assuming that it is out of Earth&#x27;s shadow - but you&#x27;ve gotta do a double conversion. You&#x27;ve gotta convert it from photon to electron to photon, back to electron. You&#x27;ve got to make this double conversion, so, okay, what&#x27;s your conversion efficiency? Hmm. All in, you&#x27;re going to have a real hard time even getting to 50%. [The solar cells are better.] It does not matter, put that cell on Earth then. See, that&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m making. Take any given solar cell, is it better to have it on Earth, or is it better to have it on orbit? What do you get from being in orbit? You get twice as much sun - best case - but you&#x27;ve got to do a conversion. You&#x27;ve got to convert it the energy to photons - well, you have incoming photons that go to electrons, but you - you&#x27;ve gotta do two conversions that you don&#x27;t have to do on Earth, which is you&#x27;ve got to turn those electrons into photons and turn those photons back into electrons on the ground, and that double conversion is going to get you back to where you started, basically. So why are you bothering sending them to bloody space. &quot;I wish I could just stab that bloody thing through the heart.&quot; BTW - electron to photon converters are not free and nor is sending stuff to space. Then it obviously super doesn&#x27;t work. Case closed. You&#x27;d think. You&#x27;d think case closed, but no. I guarantee it&#x27;s gunna come up another ten times.

The rest of it is falsities and random talking points with no relation to the question.<p>> Except it&#x27;s capital gains, intentionally taxed at a lower rate than income.<p>It&#x27;s taxed at a lower rate <i>because</i> it&#x27;s double taxation. It&#x27;s the political middle ground between not having double taxation and having it at the full ordinary income rate.<p>> The first tax is levied on corporate income, the second tax is capital gains which is taxed on the individual level.<p>They&#x27;re the same tax. It&#x27;s all income tax.<p>Consider what happens when both entities are corporations. When Ford makes income, they pay income tax on it. If the income was from selling cars they would have paid the ordinary income rate. If it was because Ford owns shares of Exxon and Exxon issued a dividend, it would be the dividend rate. In either case, when Ford issues what&#x27;s left over after paying its income taxes as a dividend, its shareholders have to pay income taxes on it <i>again</i>. And it&#x27;s the same tax (again) whether the shares in Ford are owned by Henry Ford or Apple, Inc.<p>> That&#x27;s only true in the US. The majority of G20 countries that don&#x27;t have capital gains + corporate income tax use a VAT to achieve the same ends.<p>VAT and sales tax are economically equivalent, VAT is just collected at different points in the supply chain (which makes tax evasion more difficult). VAT is only collected on the increase in value over the cost of the raw materials (the &quot;value added&quot;), i.e. the portion of the sale price that <i>hasn&#x27;t</i> already been taxed.<p>> Look at effective tax rates for individuals and corporations based in the US. We&#x27;re one if the lowest taxed countries in the 1st world.<p>What does that have anything to do with double taxation?<p>Note also that the reason effective tax rates in the US are so low is the massive amount of tax avoidance that occurs. The nominal rates that US corporations would pay if they didn&#x27;t all hold their profits in foreign subsidiaries are some of the highest in the world -- which is highly discriminatory against smaller non-international US corporations that can&#x27;t play the same tricks.",1398361313

For that, you have many models, from ‘susceptibility’: a user adopts if it pleases her, as soon as any of her neighbour adopt it; to avalanches: one can’t tell the benefit without using it, so, as a proxy, they use a number of friends using it as a threshold. There are variants, including where users can stop using it; a more obvious one is using the weight relations; a more significant is considering the structure of the network: can one potential consider that their friends using it might be part of the same group (a ‘facet’ to re-use Field’s vocabulary) and does it encourages me to adopt or no, on the contrary.<p>When you talk to people about adopting trends, they usually explain that “every body is doing it”, but if you dig using several examples, “everybody” ends up being a form or another of those model. It might be ‘influencers’ that may of may not be a stable or identifiable group, too.<p>If you are concerned in targeting ads to the right people, understanding which case work for you is key. This is why Facebook tried (controversial) ads indicating that some of your friends were using the service already.<p>But even without that creepy factor of expressly indicating that, you might want to measure whether you have better conversation rate for people with no friends, one friend, two or three, four to nine, ten to twenty, or more than that already using your service. Cases include situation where those friends might know each other, or be part of clusters or cliques (respectively, groups where everyone knows almost- and everyone else). That would allow you to target your advertising to the specific behaviour of your service.<p>I’ve been studying that for the past ten years (so not exactly when Facebook started, but initially on other networks); since, I’ve made considerable efforts to make a complex and counter-intuitive discipline clear enough for any marketing intern to grasp it; I’m not sure “gobbledegook” is exactly how I want it to be described to me.",1398359831

How did it work?

A sword makes it possible to cut and stab in ways that your hand can&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s still your hand being raised against another.<p>If you want to invoke technology, then <i>all</i> technology is a &quot;democratizing and equalizing force&quot;. And, while we&#x27;re at it, all technology becomes a tool for elitism and oppression when it fails to be equally distributed. And is it <i>ever</i>, really equally distributed to begin with? You have to pay people a profit to receive internet.

Democracy? Doesn&#x27;t exist in America. Not really. The media is right: we are a country ruled by elites. Those elites might be liberal or conservative, but they&#x27;re not <i>us</i>. There is no government by the people, because the people don&#x27;t give a shit. That&#x27;s why Dubya went up and thought that getting some elections happening in Iraq would make democracy happen.<p>I repeat: The fundamental problem isn&#x27;t that no one gets elected without spending oodles of cash; the fundamental problem is that oodles of cash <i>have to be spent at all</i>.<p>> Direct democracy has its place, but you&#x27;re not seriously suggesting rule by referendum, right?

It&#x27;s hard, but you will learn a ton. Even putting substantial effort into improving a one page program, incubating and trying out ideas over a few days, can be beneficial if there is some &quot;meat&quot; in that program to chew on.<p>In general I believe software architecture is much more low level and less philosophical than a most aspiring architects believe. It&#x27;s really about knowing the trade-offs of a decision before making it, and this rests on knowing a lot about data structures, algorithms, existing components (like databases, operating systems) etc. Those little programs in non-trivial problem areas often already show up a lot of those things.",1398358923

Many of the graduate level courses have lecture notes online and these can often give insight into current research.  Here's a page with links to EE/CS courses: <a href=""http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes-eecs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/classes-eecs.html</a> <p>Another thing to watch for, besides talks specifically open to the public, is lecture series taken for credit, such as {EE,CS}{198,298} in the above page.  I took EE298.2 last semester for example, a communications/networking/DSP seminar, which had visiting scholars presenting their current research at almost every meeting.  Nobody would have cared or probably even noticed if a random person showed up to listen.

The number of active users may be even smaller than that, and some people like I only log on once a week or so.<p>If FB gets sold for $6 billion, that means the new owning company would need to make $500 million a year for 12 years(!) to break even. Frankly, the Internet will probably be drastically different a decade from now. FB doesn't even make $50 million a year, who in their right mind thinks that they will all of a sudden make a profit off Facebook by spending that much money?<p>I swear some of these big companies just like throwing money at things. Yes, the dot-com bubble is here once again.",1184383116

34160,comment,33886,34066,0,0,Jd,,,"I disagree that we don't think in tiers in real life.  We do - except they are called roles or titles.  For instance, the typical university has undergraduate students, graduate students, professors and administrators.  One could simply say that there are four tiers.  The reason that we don't think of it this way is most of these institutions have grown up organically over time, or at the very least we aren't aware of the original design decisions.  <p>Now I'm not arguing that we should necessarily replicate real-world institutions in online form, but one should at least recognize that real-world institutions (like universities) provide various measures which enforce content quality.  <p>As for approximating real discussion, I'm not sure exactly what you mean.  There are many different types of real discussion, from idle conversation about sports to academic journals about the poetry of W.B. Yeats.  Although certain similar principles apply, the way in which you would model either of these would have to be different.  <p>I'm afraid I also don't understand what you mean by an arbitrarily-tiered system.  Are you arguing in favor of the reddit model?

In that sense, we all, including end consumers, enjoyed the benefits of TARP bailouts - assuming that without them and policies related to them, the entire financial system would collapse and drop the US to something like the great depression or worse.",1272815895

Even the authors own description of 10.04 hardly amounts to ""perfect.""<p>Its cosmetic changes are, in my opinion, dubious at best. Window controls are on the left hand side of the Window for no good reason. The color scheme is way too dark, it made me long for the old human theme. UI elements are glitchy in places. The ""Me Menu"" is useless to me. And why the heck did they ever remove the startup/shutdown options from the system menu? Why are they off on their own?<p>I like the idea of the Ubuntu Software Center but its execution leaves a lot to be desired. Last time I checked it was just another front end to apt. Many of the packages available are totally useless to the vast majority of people.<p>Ubuntu One and the Ubuntu Music store, well, we'll see how those go. Personally, I've never, ever used them and I have to wonder if they're the type of things that will actually draw people to Ubuntu<p>And, well, I hate to come off as a curmudgeon because I really do like Ubuntu, but to say that 10.04 blows OSX and Windows 7 out of the water is just wrong. It doesn't. For instance, why does Ubuntu still have the same old application menu? Both OSX and Windows 7 (and even KDE4) have moved away from this model. The categorized, hierarchical menus that have been around forever are really unhelpful. Why can't I search this menu like in Windows 7 and KDE4? For that matter, why can't I easily search <i>everything</i> like I can in Windows 7 and OSX (spotlight). If they really want to compete with Windows or OSX they need to give me better ways to find, sort and organize <i>everything</i> on my computer.",1272815797

1312623,comment,1312443,1312443,0,0,thorax,,,"Some random ideas to salvage your idea a tad (which seems to be very difficult to make work given it's difficulties):<p>* Start with a niche like used books and perhaps partner with a book swapping site (e.g. bookmooch or bookcrossing or something) to get the initial tests done on something people don't mind losing. Other second hand material would be good, too.<p>* I think you'd also do much better with such a service if you treat your site more like a craigslist for ""package hitchhiking"" and reverse the process. 
I.e. travelers post where they're going on their next road trip and they say they're willing to take a few odd things. So you'd get a lot of random trip listings perhaps all on your front page until there's enough to break them down.
People browse the site when they have something to ship (especially second hand stuff, etc) and if they see someone going the way they need, they make a bid/offer to the person going that way.<p>* On the security angle you might look into the ""friend of a friend"" and ""church group"" organization like <a href=""http://www.goloco.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goloco.org</a> does. Targeting widespread organizations or friend networks may make this more palatable to people worried about trust.<p>* Posting some examples of ""what people shipped"" on the page, with a constant stream would help people feel more comfortable.<p>* I assume there will be ebay like ratings and reviews, etc?<p>* Overall, I'm not sure this ""disrupter"" is going to work unless you can plug it into the thriving secondhand market as an extremely thrifty for low-value items. Positioning yourself initially would do you a lot of good.<p>* Finally and not most importantly, the website (unless owned by craigslist) will need a much more polished design to make people thing this is a ""real deal"" enough for them to try it out. I don't think that alone will help you, but your traction issue isn't going to be helped by your current design (usability and visually).<p>Best of luck-- regarding the other comments, sometimes the naysayers on Hacker News are wildly wrong and harsher than they used to be, but they often have very good points that will let you adapt your vision and save it. Take all the advice with a grain of salt. You're going to learn the best from your users once they start giving you feedback, so testing your idea and site is far more important than our responses.<p><i>Edit</i>: To that end, give something like feedbackarmy.com a try a few times and see what random people think about the idea and see what percentage you could get to say they'd give it a shot.",1272815267

1312621,comment,1312443,1312443,0,0,rjett,,,"Aside from the concerns I share with others of your deliveries being safe, secure, and reliable, here's how I think you should focus your product. I see no possible way that your product could initially address the needs of someone needing to ship something outside of their local city/town. If I'm travelling San Francisco to Manhattan, and your site has matched me up with someone who needs a package shipped from San Fran to the Bronx/Queens/Brooklyn etc, you would have to offer me a pretty high price to deliver that package.<p>I have two suggestions: First, start with deliveries that need to be made within a certain territory. I could maybe see something like this working in a big city like NYC since there are millions of people moving around and your chances of finding fairly precise matches for delivery routes is much higher.<p>Second, I think you would need some sort of drop box system where shippers check in their packages and deliverers check-out the package, deliver the package to the closest drop-box to the destination, and the customers pick up the package from there. I know this second point adds a huge layer of start-up cost to something like this, but it's the only way I could see it working. When the delivery person checks out a package, their account would have to be liable for damage deposit, lost/stolen package/etc and when they deliver successfully, their account would be credited whatever fee you pay them. If you had a network of redbox-like machines in public places for drop-off and pick-up then maybe something like this works.<p>I know what I've just described is probably a completely different idea, but when people are in their cars going somewhere, they've budgeted almost an exact amount of time they need to get where they're going and delivering a package to an unknown destination that may only be a little bit out of the way could completely throw a wrench in that time budgeting.",1272815198

1312590,comment,1312443,1312443,0,0,nkohari,,,"Not to rain on your parade, but I'm having a hard to understanding how you'll undercut shipping companies. Their prices are so low because they rely on economies of scale (large trucks and a very sophisticated supply chain) and complex algorithms that determine the optimal route for delivery.<p>First, there's the problem of paying the couriers. I can't speak for others, but I would never carry a package in my car for $5 -- it's not worth the hassle. I might carry 10 at once for $50, but even that payout is very low for my time... not to mention that the likelihood that my route intersects with 10 different packages being shipped on the same day is extremely low. Drivers working for shipping companies make a relatively low wage, and they ship lots of packages. You'd have to pay couriers per-package, and at a much higher marginal rate than shipping companies pay. That means additional overhead, which means your prices will go up.<p>Then you'll have extremely high overhead with respect to fraud, insurance, etc. UPS/FedEx packages are handled by professional drivers, and I'm certain that their insurance costs are still astronomical. This means more overhead, which again means higher prices still. In fact, I'm willing to bet that even if you could find an insurance agency willing to underwrite your operation, the cost to insure each package would be higher than the overall cost UPS/FedEx charges their customers to ship.<p>Finally, you're going to have a hard time convincing customers that your service is reliable and safe. That means even for the customers you will get, your cost per acquisition will be <i>much</i> higher than UPS/FedEx. That won't hurt you too much right now, but it will be a major barrier to scaling -- and scaling is the only way you're going to compete with the shipping companies.<p>Maybe you can compete on some other way than price?",1272813883

There are a lot of really good people working there, so I don't think it's an untenable problem; facebook hires good people regularly (I don't think I know anyone at facebook that I don't consider a good person, actually). But, there seems to be a disconnect about the badness of chipping away at users privacy for the benefit of advertisers and facebook. Facebook has definitely done enough things to make me mistrust them as a company since I've been a user...so, I don't share a lot with facebook, and I'm moving toward sharing less.

By the way, Monday afternoons in the spring are the busiest time in the busiest season for psychiatric ERs, so there's literally no excuse for there having only been one doctor on staff.<p>The TV was extremely loud-- probably 90 decibels-- and some of the shows that played were rather violent.

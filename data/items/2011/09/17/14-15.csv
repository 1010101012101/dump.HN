Why? The answer lies in the very nature of modern federal criminal laws, which have exploded in number but also become impossibly broad and vague. In Three Felonies a Day, Harvey A. Silverglate reveals how federal criminal laws have become dangerously disconnected from the English common law tradition and how prosecutors can pin arguable federal crimes on any one of us, for even the most seemingly innocuous behavior. The volume of federal crimes in recent decades has increased well beyond the statute books and into the morass of the Code of Federal Regulations, handing federal prosecutors an additional trove of vague and exceedingly complex and technical prohibitions to stick on their hapless targets. The dangers spelled out in Three Felonies a Day do not apply solely to white collar criminals, state and local politicians, and professionals. No social class or profession is safe from this troubling form of social control by the executive branch...</i>""",1316271279

What sucks is I started this a few weeks ago so I wouldn't be admissible for the contest. Nowjs basically kinds of adds an abstraction layer on top of socket.io and makes it easier to develop real-time apps.<p>It's especially useful if you need the concept of room. They have a multi-room chat sample which gives a good start. For example, this would be quite useful if you wanted to build a MMORPG game with different maps/rooms where each user is in a single room at a time.<p>I'm using it with the concept of rooms and instead of sending chat messages to users connected to a room, and send JSON messages of different types and based on the type of message received by the client, I use backbone.js to update the UI based on what's received. When a user's action affect other users' views, message a dispatched back to the room.<p>The only problem I see with nowjs is that if you need horizontal scaling, you would need a license for a more scalable version of nowjs that doesn't seem to be ready yet from their website. Since I'm thinking forward for my pet project, I wouldn't want to pay for this. I'm thinking to add a Redis pub sub layer to take care of horizontal scaling but would love to have access to their solution for this!",1316270186

3008090,comment,3007945,3007945,2,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"A hugely important thing to keep in mind when learning is ""humility is endless"".  I remember when I started out I felt like I knew hopelessly nothing.  Well it turns out that this is actually a good thing.  You learn much better when you approach everything with the attitude of ""I don't know this so I am open to everything"" (There's a concept of 'Beginners Mind' in Zen Buddhism which is similar).  I find that new programmers are discouraged by this feeling, when in fact the most dangerous thing is when you start to approach problems with the attitude (and we've all done this) ""Okay I'm a smart guy , this should be easy to understand"".  So cherish that feeling of ignorance, and work to maintain it (the feeling not the actual ignorance).<p>And of course the biggest thing is to try to put in 1-3 hours a day of practice.  Coding a problem you have solved before is not practice.  Always be pushing yourself. At first this is very easy since everything is new, just code 1-3 hours a night.  But as you get better continue to try to learn new things, code problems from a book you're reading, start learning a programming language that challenges you, implement new algorithms, refactor and improve something you've written etc.  Essentially practice is very closely related to humility.<p>Put in enough hours of true practice and you will be a better programmer.<p>I also should add that I did find taking formal classes helpful (and it can help with pushing you to realize how much you don't know, force you to practice etc).  People make a distinction between autodidactic and formal learning, but really the best solution is both, and they are not mutually exclusive so there's no reason not too.",1316269988

But I think becoming ""technical"" is critical to learning how to code.<p>I don't mean you should start solving equations in your spare time. I just mean find a concrete problem that you're motivated to solve (i.e. something fun), and then solve it.<p>Maybe you think AI is cool, so try to figure out what it takes to make an interactive chat with the computer (easier than it sounds). Maybe you think computer graphics are cool, so figure out how to make a web page that has a ball bounce when you click it.<p>Above all, make the path interesting and fun for yourself. You'll get a lot further that way than you will by reading books or watching screencasts that brainwash you into the author's (or the programming language's) way of thinking. Most of programming is a transferable skill set anyway.<p>That's what I mean by becoming ""technical"".

3008087,comment,3007945,3007945,2,0,viscanti,,,"It really depends what you want to do as a programmer.  Different programming languages do better or worse jobs of making the general concepts of computer science digestible.  My advice for someone just starting off, who wants to be ""well rounded"", is to start learning Python.  'Learn Python the Hard Way' followed by a couple more introductory tutorials will help you get your head around a lot of the concepts of computer science that are found in most programming languages.<p>From there, it's worth working on a couple projects.  You'll have built a few by following the introductory Python tutorials, but pick something you're interested in and actually build it.  It doesn't need to be a huge project, something small will do.  Once you understand the syntax of the language and why you use specific concepts, building something helps cement that knowledge.<p>Once you've built a few of your own programs, you'll have a better idea of what you're actually interested in, and what you can do.  You won't need to follow a specific route by then, you'll be able to learn what you want to learn.  I'd suggest that you pick up a functional language next.  Haskell does a great job of packing in a LOT of computer science concepts, especially on the functional side of things.  Follow the same process you did with Python.  Start with a couple introductory tutorials, then build a couple programs.<p>If you've got Python and Haskell under your belt, you're really ready to tackle anything you can think of.  Learning a new language will be easy.  You'll find deep library support for pretty much anything you could want to do.  From there you really can pick anything you're interested in and built it or learn it.",1316269912

Of course sometimes this won't be relevant, and you could do away with the lock screen. E.g. the Eee Transformer requires the usual Honeycomb unlock gesture when it wakes up undocked or in the dock by pressing the power button, but not when it's in laptop mode and is woken up by the lid being opened.",1316268552

(Here I'm talking about a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe, not a full-fledged PS3 of XBox game). Programming something that is purely for fun provides a lot of gratification and reward. The joy of seeing the result is what propels you in spite of the frustration of error and failure. Plus, since you're in control of the project, you can focus on the fun stuff and postpone or skip boring things. For example, have a go at writing a Sudoku solver, or Cryptoquote, or Mastermind.",1316268537

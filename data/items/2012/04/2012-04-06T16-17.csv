3807908,comment,3807085,3807592,5,0,awj,,,"A lot of people will have a lot of advice, but the simple truth is that the only thing that works is diet and exercise.<p>Being in shape is a lifestyle issue. It's not something that happens overnight or that you can do in one go, it requires a fundamental change in how you approach living. I'm not trying to discourage you, but to steer you away from the ""you can fix it quick with no effort"" snake oil that abounds.<p>My advice:<p>1. Become your own expert. Learn how your body works, how nutrition works, how exercise works, how ... I've found that reddit's fitness community [1] has some great places to start. There's a ridiculous amount of good information out there. (Protip: most of the good info can cite studies, less than half of the bad even bothers)<p>2. Make it fun. Learn new recipes, try activities you've always wanted to do, do <i>anything</i> but force yourself to change. After a while the causation between ""not fun"" exercises or diet changes and their benefits will sink into your brain and make things easier, but to start if it sucks you'll probably quit.<p>3. Don't agonize over the scale. Your body weight fluctuates throughout the day and various activities. It's not uncommon to see a single day +/- 6lb change <i>just in the water your body is holding</i>. Aim for <i>feeling</i> better (or <i>looking</i> better, if that's your goal) not a number on a scale. Weigh yourself when you start, then come back after three months.<p>4. Be persistent. You're talking about a lifestyle change here. These don't happen overnight. You'll probably spend a long time being disappointed at apparent non-progress then wake up one day wondering when things changed. Do your homework and learn what you need to do, then start doing it and trust that the results will come. In a world where we can use our phones to identify and buy the song that's playing right now, results in this come agonizingly slow.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness</a>",1333731113

I'm sure Linux users also need to explain to their network admins that they're running Linux.<p>The term ""PC"" persists not just for historical reasons, but because its hard to come up with a replacement term.  A ""Mac"" refers both to hardware and the OS, whereas a ""PC"" means ""Windows OS running on Windows-compatible computer"".  I suppose we could replace the term ""PC"" with ""WOS-ROWCC"".",1333730781

3807872,comment,3803026,3806558,2,0,kmavm,,,"I haven't done any work on the type inference stuff, so my understanding is second-hand. My peers who actually know what they're talking about are working on a more complete write-up, so stay tuned.<p>1. (Type inference.) The compiler's type inference is basically a first-order symbolic execution without inlining; we don't iterate to a fixed point or anything, and any union types at all cause us to give up and call it a variant. Many other PHP surprises mess up type inference; for example, function parameters by reference aren't marked in the caller, so if anywhere in the codebase there exists a unary function that takes its first parameter by reference, $f($a) will spoil our inference of $a: $f might mutate it.<p>Still, simple things work pretty well. One major area we do well on is inferring the return types of function calls. It's hard to say how much we're missing out by not doing more sophisticated type inference; while we can count the sites at compile time, this doesn't tell us which sites are dynamically important. Our anecdotal experience has been that type inference is one of the more powerful optimizations we can perform.<p>We don't model refcounts, and I'm certain there are opportunities there.<p>2. (Compile times.) 15 minutes sounds about right to me, and chuckr would certainly know better. Compiler speed itself is something we pay attention to, since it inhibits our ability to turn pushes around. The actual global AST analysis is multithreaded, so we keep the whole build machine busy. So far the trade-offs between optimizations and compile time have not been too dire; there haven't been things that would make the binary twice as fast if only we could compile twenty times as long, e.g.<p>3. (PHP implementation/semantics). Who've you been ""arguing"" against? :). It's a manifest fact that accidents of PHP's implementation have been sunk into the language. Destructors are one of the ways to witness refcounts, but there are others. var_dump() of arrays exposes the refcount of internal data; things whose refcount is >1 are displayed with a '&' preceding them, e.g.:<p><?
$a[0] = 1;
var_dump($a);
$data =& $a[0];
var_dump($a);
unset($data);
var_dump($a); ?><p>produces<p>array(1) {
  [0]=>
  int(1)
}
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  &int(1)
}
array(1) {
  [0]=>
  int(1)
}<p>Less trivially, it is hard to efficiently support the copy semantics for arrays without reference counting; other systems have overcome this, but it is less trivial than with refcounting.",1333730626

Let me know how you'd parallelize the above in Java, how many lines of code it'll take, what syntactic constructs you'd end up using, what libraries you'd import, and finally your my mental model would be - in terms of locks and semaphores and so forth. The thing with scala is that concurrency - both data parallelism ( above example ) and task parallelism ( using actors in scala, a slightly longer example) are baked right into the language.

Our chosen screening process, the audition, is imperfect for many of the same reasons given for why puzzle solving sometimes falls short when it comes to screening for developers:<p>- The ability to perform on audition day doesn't necessarily correlate with the abilty to perform consistently in concert settings.
- Great solo players aren't always great ensemble players.
- It is very difficult to predict how an auditionee will mature over time.<p>That said, our field has yet to come up with anything better, and I think the organization I work for has developed a particularly good screening process:<p>On audition day, applicants are asked to perform some excerpts from literature our organization plays regularly, a prepared solo selection, and to do some sight-reading. This is pretty standard stuff for the clasical music industry and this preliminary round is done from behind a screen to help combat biases on the part of the panel. The excerpts are important because that's closest to the work applicants will be doing on a day to day basis if selected. The prepared solo helps show the candidates potential to excel in solo situations. The sight reading is crucial because it is a basic and necessary skill and correlates very highly with the applicant's quality of musical training.<p>The second round (generally 5-15 applicants from the initial pool of about 100) is where our organization does things a little differently. It consists of more excerpts and sight-reading, but this time applicants are asked to make adjustments to how they performed the selections (a little faster or slower, a little louder or softer, etc.). Observing how the candidates respond to these requests shows how nimble the musicians will be in a rehearsal setting, and also shows how well-prepared they are and how well they will take direction.<p>In the final round (generally 2-5 candidates), applicants are asked to perform alongside members of our organization. This demonstrates more responsiveness, how well the applicant listens, and how well the candidate performs in a group setting.<p>With that in mind, I often wonder why those looking to hire developers don't use a multi-stage ""audition"" process.<p>Step one could consist of some thing along the lines of ""Here's a piece of code like what you might see in our organization. There's a bug in it. Find and fix the bug and send the revised code back to us."" Step one could also consist of a short puzzle-type problem. Step one could be 100% automatic and would require the same amount of time for 100 applicants as it would for 1000 applicants.<p>Step two could be where applicants are asked to show samples of something they've coded in the past. This could also be where they are asked to perform a more difficult bug fix and a more difficult puzzle. In this round, applicants are told that their code will be read for documentation quality and use of good style.<p>Finally a final round could be done in-person where an applicant is asked to solve a problem with existing members of the team. This could be done in conjunction with one on one interview. This would help tell if the candidate is someone the team actually would enjoy working with, and how the candidate would be able to contribute.<p>I know I wouldn't mind submitting to such an application process because I could see how each step is relevant to what the company is looking for. It also shows that the company takes hiring seriously. Hiring is supposed to be hard. Knowing that every one else on the team has been able to excel in those circumstances gives me greater confidence that I'd be joining a great team.",1333730149

Apple makes doing this very cumbersome and expensive.  Just to be able to talk to the serial port you have to be approved for MFi membership and comply with a million requirements that only add expense to a product.  That's why you don't see a simple serial cable available for open use.  You can't legally buy the connectors and you have to also buy a decryption chip even to use the simplest functions.<p>That's why you have people resorting to the ridiculous (but it works) extreme of using the headphone jack to build such things as credit card scanners and the like.  They don't regulate the use of the headphone jack and seem to be approving apps that use it.  Headphone jacks were being used way back when (Commodore 64 and TRS80 days) to talk to cassette-tape based storage.  It's literally going back 30+ years in technology.<p>While, on the surface, open peripheral port access might seem like a geek feature I think that this is far from reality.  If peripheral port access on the iPhone was open for all to use you'd see all kinds of very interesting things happening with hardware for the iDevices that you simply aren't going to see given the current framework.<p>Also, this is the reason why there are no inexpensive iDevice compatible hardware products.  Developing them is very expensive due to the nature of the process.<p>If MS was open about their I/O and they achieved reasonable penetration there's a whole layer of the product world that would open up to their tech.<p>I think that when you come from behind and have the financial resources you just can't afford to ignore any market, no matter how insignificant it might look from your current vantage point.

Yes, diet.  Strength training builds/retains muscle, so do it.  HIIT cardio helps some, steady state cardio a bit as well.  But really, it's mostly diet.<p>If you want to understand more about this, you could look into starvation literature.  On a reduced-calorie-only approach, about 25% of your <i>weight</i> loss comes not from <i>fat</i> but <i>muscle</i>.  Which is among the key reasons diet-only approaches fail.  Among exercises, it's <i>strength</i> training which builds muscle, not <i>cardio</i>, which is why a running-only exercise approach won't get you ripped either.<p>This is also a major reason why I find the emphasis on ""weight"" loss in both mainstream and medical literature immensely frustrating.  What really matters is the relationship between two tissue types, subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle.  They're gained and lost through very different mechanisms, and play very different roles in body function. Confounding both as ""weight"" is  an immense disservice.<p>For a plan putting this together, there's <i>The New Rules of Lifting</i>, or for the gals, <i>The New Rules of Lifting for Women</i>.

The language is mind-numbingly boring.<p>When Scala and Clojure projects go ""straight to Java"", it's generally for specialized purposes (where those languages don't have native maturity) or in already-discovered bottlenecks. I think some degree of that's inevitable. Like database tuning, it's just something you have to do when you get to a certain point where (a) your problem is well-defined, and (b) shaving 20% off latency is worth doing. I consider these good problems to have. If I have to rewrite a class in Java for performance reasons, fine. I'd never start a multi-thousand-line project in Java, though.<p>Also, I really don't think anyone mature minds <i>writing</i> code in underpowered or difficult languages. C++, I find, is actually a lot of fun to write. It's <i>reading</i> other peoples' code, in large amounts, that becomes intolerable in these languages. If I have to spend a day to answer a simple question like ""how do I initialize this object?"", that's bad.<p>Interesting fact: Closures were cut from the 1.0 release for time. Gosling wanted them in, but Java's original purpose was to run in machines like automatic coffee pots and TV ""set top boxes"", so they were far from essential for that domain. The folk history (which I once believed) of Java being deliberately underpowered so that teams of hundreds of mediocre programmers could be stapled together in it is false. It was, however, co-opted by the ""let's commoditize developers"" crowd in the late '90s, and we've had to deal with FactoryVisitorDelegates ever since.",1333729663

Especially if you're a startup.<p>Do you have a VP of engineering who knows what the hell they're doing? Do you insulate the devs from sales people making ridiculous promises? Is your code base in good shape so someone can come in and make a difference without having to learn the complete spaghetti stack? Do you have a well designed deployment procedure that has dev, test, and production environments?<p>How do you approach scheduling? I'd say this is the number one issue that leads to bad experiences for developers, so tell us up front that you have this under control. Do I ever have to hear a business guy say ""I don't see why that would take more than a few minutes...""<p>In other words, prove that every problem isn't solved with ""developers work more hours.""<p>Say something that at least implies you know that these issues <i>exist</i>.

It's much easier to gain valuable skills in personal, open source, and consulting projects, because you can target your work towards sought after languages, tools, and frameworks, and clients you contract with will often let you choose the technologies if you make a good case for them. Bad companies will tend to use bad and outdated technologies, and they won't be open to the suggestions from a new hire.<p>It's also extremely difficult to build a strong portfolio working at a bad company, because bad companies by their nature rarely get anything done, and even if they do, they'll pigeonhole you into the most monotonous tasks and you'll get 0 experience making architectural decisions or working on anything outside whatever little gutter they throw you in.<p>On the contrary, doing your own projects or contracting (ideally with startups or small companies) will force you to learn every level of the tech-business stack, from feature planning to architecture to coding to design to deployment to launching and promotion. You can work on many projects in a short timespan, and you'll be left with numerous portfolio pieces that are all your own.<p>""Most companies wouldn't even consider you as a contractor unless you have several years of solid experience. I can only assume you mean the kind of 'contracting' that happens at places like rentacoder.com.""<p>This simply isn't true. You just need to sell yourself and show that you have good ideas and get things done. I got paid $60 per hour on my first rails project with no experience whatsoever in rails. The client never asked. She just saw that I had several strong pieces of work in my portfolio (half of them personal projects), and told me to use whatever tools I thought best for the job. If you're considering rent-a-coder you're definitely doing it wrong.<p>Don't settle for mediocrity. Take the initiative and start building a portfolio any way you can. The sky's the limit once you have a solid body of work to point to. You can make good money contracting or you can have your pick of awesome jobs. Having experience in some crappy job isn't what matters, it's showing that you can build great software.",1333729084

We learned a lot about blindness from having guardianship of our blind teenage nephew for a year. True, the ear piece would be the big benefit for him (though one eye was very slightly sensitive to light). Others at his school had varying degrees of low vision and might at least benefit from bright flashes of light. But the big gain would be something that describes his environment out loud. Blind people do still aim their faces toward things. And it's much better than a similar capability in a handheld device such as the iPhone or iPod Touch, because for the blind, orienting a handheld device correctly can be a major problem. We turned on the accessibility features for our nephew's iPod, but the thing would switch from landscape to portrait as he turned his hand slightly. Head-mounted is the way to go.

Maybe I use my real name on twitter, and I do not wish to use it with the service I am trying out (or the otherway round). The linkage extends even further. If I signin to both, service A and service B with the same twitter login, now these two can link to each other, without any assistance.<p>2. It takes mental effort to keep track of all the permission I may have granted to various services from my various identity providers. If I want to disable access, I need to make extra effort. If there is no linkage, I merely forget it about it and it goes away. Even you say ""They don't get your email (I think)"" - that ""I think"" right there is the problem. I would have to keep (and maintain) a mental checklist of everything I am providing access to when I use a syndicated login service.<p>3. Permissions evolve. Twitter may change its access policies, a new hack might allow privilege escalation. Each time this happens, I would need to review what apps have which permissions. For services I actively use, I am willing to put in that effort If absolutely needed, but for something I tried out as an evaluation, its not worth the hassle.<p>As I said, until I am convinced I am going to be using the service, I do not wish it to stick around in my ""apps with permissions"" list, or anything else for that matter. If I try it out, and decide it aint for me, I just want to navigate away and never think about it again.",1333728588

For instance, a standard left brain approach is to break a large problem into smaller sub problems which can be easily managed.  When I'm doing functional programming, it's easy to start breaking down a problem via recursion, but the idiom for imperative programming is often to tackle the whole problem at once.  To me, that seems to require far more pattern recognition and gestalt understanding than the reductionist functional approach.",1333728547

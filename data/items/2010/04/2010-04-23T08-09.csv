(apologies to Will.S.)<p>Large wooden drafting tables, and tall four-legged drafting stools (with foot-rest cross-bars, topped by a square seat sloping slightly forwards), used to fill many of the classrooms in the engineering school I knew many moons ago.<p>Alas, it mostly got 'updated' to standard tables and plastic chairs. But those unpadded high seats still strike me as healthier than hunching in a chair.<p>An old furniture store might have some around - a cheap alternative to expensive desks.",1272013147

The top-right icons (at least, in XP) could be (from right to left): x to close, window to maximise, line to minimise to taskbar, and a dot (in a square) to minimise to the system tray.<p>Applications could then act differently based on where they were minimised - e.g., icon animations to convey a message, can't steal window focus, can show little alerts/messages, etc.",1272012826

The hard-disk of course is the current bottle neck, so removing it entirely from the picture with potentially smaller, and cheaper devices alone will lead to an insane amount of innovation.<p>For example, the idea that we can move away from the von Neumann model and have in-memory processing (so-to-speak) could lead to a revolution in computer vision and other highly parallel, compute-intensive, pattern matching applications.<p>For now, HP will begin to deploy these things in tiny, very sensitive sensors that will lead to, potentially, more efficient discovery of oil:

1287611,comment,1287110,1287110,0,0,CRASCH,,,"No one wants to train new employees. It is expensive.<p>I totally disagree with the filter. I don't want employees that aren't going to tough it out and quit mid-project either. That isn't what we are talking about though. We are talking about people that probably switched jobs for any number of reasons. Not hiring someone just because they switched jobs or independently consulted, that seems so arbitrary it is almost comical.<p>It really is a two way street. I worked at a place that had 98% employee retention for multiple years through the boom. Almost everyone there was heavily recruited and almost no one left. Even the people that were previously independent consultants and the ones that had job hopped. Why? It was a great place to work with above average compensation and awesome people to work with.<p>My point is that if you compensate people well and you provide a great place to work you don't have to filter for potential job hoppers. You are then free to filter for the important things like work ethic, aptitude, skill, and fitting in.",1272012591
1287610,comment,1286952,1286952,0,0,lionhearted,,,"These two lines seem somewhat obvious, but are actually quite insightful to me now that I think about:<p>> This is not because [kings] are hostile to markets. On the contrary, they normally encourage them, for the simple reason that governments find it inconvenient to levy everything they need (silks, chariot wheels, flamingo tongues, lapis lazuli) directly from their subject population; it’s much easier to encourage markets and then buy them.<p>>  This actually helps explain the rather puzzling behaviour on the part of royal courts: after all, since kings usually controlled the gold and silver mines, what exactly was the point of stamping bits of the stuff with your face on it, dumping it on the civilian population, and then demanding they give it back to you again as taxes? It only makes sense if levying taxes was really a way to force everyone to acquire coins, so as to facilitate the rise of markets, since markets were convenient to have around.",1272012495

I'm not super convinced it works but let's say you're considering a switch to telco video or satellite you might think twice about it because you use Cablevision wifi at the coffee shop. Telcos pioneered most of the bundled wireless deployments so there's some pressure for cable to offer it just to say they have it. It's cheap to deploy and maintain too so why not?

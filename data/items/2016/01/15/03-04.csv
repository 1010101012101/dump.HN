To elaborate on a few points:<p>- While enrolling 500 people with breast cancer in a study might be easy enough at one academic hospital, there are lots of rare cancer types. It&#x27;s fiendishly hard to gather enough cases to do real research on these, and samples are like gold, so people are resistant to sharing.<p>- There&#x27;s lots of duplication of effort. While studies funded by the NIH are required to deposit their data, what&#x27;s being deposited is raw sequence data, which requires lots of computation, disk, and skill to turn back into useful information about the mutations in cancer.<p>- The clinical data (phenotype) that is released with studies is often incomplete or vague enough to be useless<p>- Getting data into and out of these access-controlled repositories is, to put it mildly, a pain in the ass.<p>We do need to protect people&#x27;s privacy, but removing some of these hurdles would go a long way towards accelerating the field.",1452830282

10907056,comment,10905118,10906229,0,0,sebastos,,,"I think the point is that it lives on a spectrum. If inflation was so bad that your savings would be worthless tomorrow, you would run out and buy as many materials goods and services as possible. If you knew that tomorrow it would reach 10 times its current value, you might go hungry for a day to cash in on that.<p>In either case, you&#x27;re obfuscating the consumer&#x27;s real demand due to 2nd order speculation. Using some particular good as a unit of account fundamentally introduces a distortion into the way that people elect to spend / save. And many people have different takeaways from this fact. If you&#x27;re a goldbug or a Bitcoin enthusiast, you think that inflationary pressure is evil and deflationary pressure is good. If you&#x27;re really into Keynesianism, you might think that consumption is good and saving is counterproductive. If you&#x27;re the Federal Reserve, you think there is a right amount of spending that expert economists should target by tinkering with the money supply.<p>For anyone interested, I personally think the real answer is to look for ways to design a system that removes the distortion entirely by introducing a currency that cannot be held. In other words, a financial system in which the unit of account, the grease in the gears of the economy, only exists in the brief context of a transaction. The actual holding of wealth would all be done using electronic &quot;shares&quot; of real material goods, sort of like what you&#x27;re buying at a commodities exchange. In this world, people&#x27;s personal savings would be electronic, hyper-diversified stock portfolios. The &quot;currency&quot; of this system, if you could even call it that, simply acts as a yardstick for understanding relative costs, rather than needing to understand the N^2 different exchange rates of a typical barter system. You would hold micro shares in thousands of different products thanks to automatic software tools that blended expedience with your desire to personally elect what goods you wanted a long position on. In this way, the appreciation / depreciation of your personal savings would rely quite transparently on current values of the goods it represented. Crucially, removing this layer of abstraction would make it much harder for your fortune to evaporate purely on perception of value (see: Zimbabwe) since you would never give it away for less than what the underlying goods were worth to you personally.",1452830007

I have tried telling my senior management that the average senior developer salary in Boston will go from 120k in 2014 to 140k by 2017.  I don&#x27;t think that 16% can be called &quot;exploding&quot;, since it&#x27;s just 5% y-o-y, but it&#x27;s definitely growing faster than the rest of the economy, and one of the few jobs where &quot;real income&quot; is growing.<p>Finally, my observation is that the biotech boom in Boston has created unique housing pressure in Boston, particular South Boston, Cambridge and the North End (East Boston is the only affordable place).  So many biotech IPOs in the area have created newfound millionaires over night, and helped support a housing boom in the area.  Combine this with DraftKings, Wayfair, Buildium, Amazon acquiring Kiva Systems, Samsung acquiring LoopPay, and other major tech companies coming into the area over the last 5 years, and you suddenly have markets where there is huge competition for labor but really expensive housing.  This necessarily entails salary hikes or relocation.  Relocation requires the board to negotiate with other states to relocate talent, which is always treacheous for high end white collar jobs.<p>If you want metrics to validate your assumptions, I recommend using CareerBuilder rather than these newer places like Hired.com.

10906999,comment,10905643,10905643,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"That&#x27;s right. Focus on the baseband is kind of the new fad in mainstream ITSEC. These problems are long-known in high-assurance as the cert requires <i>all things that can compute, store, or do I/O</i> to be assessed. The reason is that, historically, these were all where attacks came in. I&#x27;m pretty tired but I can do at least a few points here.<p>1. Software. The phones run complex, low-assurance software in unsafe language and inherently-insecure architecture. A stream of attacks and leaks came out of these. The model for high-assurance was either physical separation with trusted chip mediating or separation kernels + user-mode virtualization of Android, etc so security-critical stuff ran outside that. There was strong mediation of inter-partition communications.<p>2. Firmware of any chip in the system, esp boot firmware. These were privileged, often thrown together even more, and might survive reinstall of other components.<p>3. Baseband standards. Security engineer Clive Robinson detailed many times of Schneier&#x27;s blog the long history between intelligence services (mainly British) and carriers, with the former wielding influence on standards. Some aspects of cellular stacks were straight designed to facilitate their activities. On top of that, the baseband would have to be certified against such requirements and this allowed extra leverage given lost sales if no certification.<p>4. Baseband software. This is the one you hear about most. They hack baseband software, then hack your phone with it.<p>5. Baseband hardware. One can disguise a flaw here as debugging stuff left over or whatever. Additionally, baseband has RF capabilities that we predicted could be used in TEMPEST-style attacks on other chips. Not sure if that has happened yet.<p>6. Main SOC is complex without much security. It might be subverted or attacked. With subversion, it might just be a low-quality counterfeit. Additionally, MMU or IOMMU might fail due to errata. Old MULTICS evaluation showed sometimes one can just keep accessing stuff all day waiting for a logic or timing-related failure to allow access. They got in. More complex stuff might have similar weaknesses. I know Intel does and fights efforts to get specifics.<p>7. Mixed-signal design ends up in a lot of modern stuff, including mobile SOC&#x27;s. Another hardware guru that taught me ASIC issues said he&#x27;d split his security functions (or trade secrets) between digital and analog so the analog effects were critical for operation. Slowed reverse engineering because their digital customers didn&#x27;t even see the analog circuits with digital tools nor could understand them. He regularly encountered malicious or at least deceptive behavior in 3rd party I.P. that similarly used mixed-signal tricks. I&#x27;ve speculated before on putting a backdoor in the analog circuits modulating the power that enhances power analysis attacks. Lots of potential for mixed-signal attacks that are little explored.<p>8. Peripheral hardware is subverted, counterfeit, or has similar problems as above. Look at a smartphone breakdown sometime to be amazed at how many chips are in it. Analog circuitry and RF schemes as well.<p>9. EMSEC. The phone itself is often an antenna from my understanding. There&#x27;s passive and active EMSEC attacks that can extract keys, etc. Now, you might say &quot;Might as well record audio if they&#x27;re that close.&quot; Nah, they get the master secret and they have everything in many designs. EMSEC issues here were serious in the past: old STU-III&#x27;s were considered compromised (master leaked) if certain cellphones got within like 20 ft of them because cell signals forced secrets to leak. Can&#x27;t know how much of this problem has gotten better or worse with modern designs.<p>10. Remote update. If your stack supports it, then this is an obvious attack vector if carrier is malicious or compelled to be.<p>11. Apps themselves if store review, permission model, and/or architecture is weak. Debatable how so except for architecture: definitely weak. Again, better designs in niche markets used separation kernels with apps split between untrusted stuff (incl GUI) in OS and security part outside OS. Would require extra infrastructure and tooling for mainstream stuff, though, plus adoption by providers. I&#x27;m not really seeing either in mainstream providers. ;)<p>That&#x27;s just off the top of my head from prior work trying to secure mobile or in hardware. My mobile solution, developed quite some time ago, fit in a suitcase due to the physical separation and interface requirements. My last attempt to put it in a phone still needed a trusted keyboard & enough chips that I designed (not implemented) it based on Nokia 9000 Communicator. Something w/ modern functions, form-factor, <i>and</i> deals with above? Good luck...<p>All smartphones are insecure. Even the secure ones. I&#x27;ve seen good ideas and proposals but no secure[ish] design is implemented outside <i>maybe</i> Type 1 stuff like Sectera Edge. Even it cheats that I can tell with physical separation and robust firmware. It&#x27;s also huge thanks to EMSEC & milspec. A secure phone will look more like that or the Nokia. You see a slim little Blackphone, iPhone, or whatever offered to you? Point at a random stranger and suggest they might be the sucker the sales rep was looking for.<p>Don&#x27;t trust any of them. Ditch your mobile or make sure battery is removable. Don&#x27;t have anything mobile-enabled in your PC. Just avoid wireless in general unless its infrared. Even then it needs to be off by default.",1452829028

The only interesting thing it does (apart from storing constants like its serial number and variables like your phone book and text messages) is to generate authentication responses (to prove to the network that you have it) and derive session keys (so your phone can encrypt and authenticate what it sends over the air).<p>All the interfaces to this are open: the wire protocol to the SIM and the over-the-air protocols for authentication and security (what a phone needs to do) are specified completely by freely available 3GPP/ETSI specs.<p>The details of how the SIM computes the derived keys and authentication response are a black box. 3GPP suggests a couple of sample algorithm sets, but there&#x27;s no way to know whether the card did that unless you have the secret key (shared between the card and a box deep inside the carrier&#x27;s network).<p>However, the phone just passes the authentication-request parameters in an authenticate command to the card, passes the result of that in an authentication-response message back to the network, and obtains integrity and ciphering keys (for GSM) from a couple of files on the card (UMTS/LTE use some keys derived from these, but again, it&#x27;s documented).<p>An alternative, used in some older US specs like late AMPS, CDMA, and (EIA-136) TDMA is to store the secrets in the phone, generally at manufacturing time. This means that there&#x27;s no real boundary between the carrier&#x27;s authentication widget and &quot;your&quot; phone.<p>Much better to have the identity contained in a SIM that belongs to the carrier, that your phone talks to at arm&#x27;s length.<p>Java seems to be for applications other than plain (U)SIM like prepaid account management.

It&#x27;s practically the polar opposite of technology. Not a whole lot startups can really do.<p>> Specifically, I&#x27;m wondering why there are no cheap modular houses (like in movie ex machina). Houses that are mass produced, cheap and relatively easy to ship and assemble but configurable.<p>Well, that&#x27;s easy to answer. In most real estate transactions, the cost of the underlying land is going to be the dominant factor, the house is just a value-add, the equivalent of buying a soda with your meal.<p>Modular houses themselves are at a disadvantage because it&#x27;s not the cheapest way to put homes on land. Modern stick-framed houses are so cheap to put up these days that once you factor in the R&D, transportation and specialized installation costs, factory-built modular homes are at a severe disadvantage. Construction workers are literally everywhere, the labor is so cheap that it&#x27;s practically a non-factor.<p>Also, it&#x27;s easy to over-build. If developers create a glut, nobody&#x27;s going to make money for a long time. Prices don&#x27;t really come down during a glut because the developer would rather let the house sit than sell at a loss. So you get a lot of empty housing stock sitting around.",1452827550

Sibling commenters bring up examples like Atom and Electron that GitHub pours salary money into but don&#x27;t make money off of.<p>Also, it assumes that the requests don&#x27;t matter for paying users – on the contrary, the features listed in the original article could be useful features that could make more projects, including paid projects, use GitHub Issues, which could in turn make more people pay for GitHub. I know that the first request, metadata for issues, would have been <i>incredibly</i> useful for when my team was using GitHub Issues.<p>Finally, the lack of features that open-source authors consider important is a pretty big deal. This article asks, where are the projects going to go if GitHub doesn&#x27;t implement these features? Well, it&#x27;s far from inconceivable that they&#x27;d switch to another place that had better features and supported open-source projects more fully, taking away steam from what originally pushed GitHub to be so popular and become the juggernaut in public and private source code hosting – open-source projects.<p>Remember Google Code and SourceForge?",1452827008

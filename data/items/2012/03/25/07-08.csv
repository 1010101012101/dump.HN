So you guys get this.<p>The best text on learning how to draw is a copy of Preston Blair's book(s) on drawing for animation. However that's only half the equation, because it lacks exercises. So you need to go to <a href=""http://johnkcurriculum.blogspot.com/2009/12/preston-blair-lessons-fundamentals-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://johnkcurriculum.blogspot.com/2009/12/preston-blair-le...</a> and do what he tells you to. They will seem stupid at first. But trust John; a significant percentage of the talent in the Hollywood tv animation scene learnt their craft under his harsh tutelage.<p>Other textbooks on drawing I've read: Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, Figure Drawing for All It's Worth, The Vilppu Drawing Manual, The Animator's Workbook.<p>The combination of Preston Blair (long considered THE classic text on drawing for animation) and John K's exercises will VERY RAPIDLY teach you how to look at things,mbreak them down into simple shapes, and draw them convincingly. Other texts teach this but few start with the super-solid, super-simple cartoon art found in 1940s cartoons; you're immediately thrown into trying to break down a human body, or a car, or whatever, into shapes you don't understand yet. The simple characters wear their construction on their sleeves, so it's easy for you to understand it and learn.",1332662265

The learning capabilities and specialties of students are as diverse as the rest of human nature, and the best way to create proper incentives for students and teachers is to build a pervasive culture that rewards learning and meaningful contribution to society. Perhaps American education needs to edit its message: aligning extracurricular American cultural values to highlight the positive effects of learning on success will likely increase test scores more than the next set of standardized whatevers that get thrown at them by an overwhelmed, out-of-touch committee.",1332662047

But perhaps I'm being too pragmatic.<p>While its true there are some forms of functions that can be found to either halt or not, some can't. For example, ask the user for a boolean, and do a while loop based on this value. You can't say whether this will halt or not, but it does contain unspecified variables.<p>Then consider the Collatz Conjecture. We can't prove any other number then 1 actually reaches 1 without simulating the process. Since we don't even know if the next step will reach the destination, we can't make any decision about when it will halt.

Ultimately, the gist was that, among other personality characteristics, people who identified as 'introvert' were more 'successful'. This may have absolutely nothing to do with intelligence, per se, but in my humble opinion; it probably does (not saying this because I identify as 'introvert').",1332659886

In this instance I don't believe an ""all or nothing"" attitude about all IP is healthy. The same way an all or nothing attitude about taxes, war, death penalty, and freedom of speech is healthy. Too much protection and we get patent trolling, not enough protection and we get IP theft leading to less innovation and unfair treatment of the inventors. Naturally, our instinct is to share something with friends when we discover it. Which is why music and movies are pirated so much. Stealing IP, that's also a human instinct passed down from our lovely evolutionary primate relatives. To an extent it's beneficial (creative commons, github forking, open source projects) and too much stealing/borrowing is destructive to its inventors while really beneficial to the stealing party (Like the way China's been ""borrowing"" high speed rail and maglev technology from Siemens, Transrapid, and other companies and re-patenting everything with slight changes so they can avoid licensing costs and can resell the technology as ""Chinese Innovation""). At that level it's really unacceptable, pirating music and movies here and there, that's entertainment, it's not right but it's not seriously destructive to society.",1332659272

3751929,comment,3751882,3751882,7,0,rbehrends,,,"A couple of caveats.<p>First, you rarely want to use setjmp() and longjmp(), but _setjmp() and _longjmp(), or sigsetjmp(..., 0) and siglongjmp(..., 0) to avoid saving and restoring the signal mask. You'll rarely be modifying the signal mask in between, and the additional kernel calls to save/restore the signal mask are pretty expensive.<p>Second, any function that uses setjmp() or friends should have its variables declared volatile (or at least those that you rely on after executing a longjmp()). Otherwise, you risk that they do not have the proper value after a longjmp(). In particular, variables that are stored in registers and were modified between setjmp() and longjmp() will typically be restored to the value they had when setjmp() has called, not the value they had when you called the function that resulted in a longjmp() (and optimizing compilers may introduce further bugs). Unfortunately, declaring a variable as volatile will typically prevent quite a few optimizations, but it's still necessary for correctness.",1332659008

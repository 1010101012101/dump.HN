Specifically, you train yourself to increase the amount of alpha-band and theta-band activity in your brain. Theta-band is where you start getting creative; alpha-band allows your working consciousness (the one you use to read these words) to visualize/verbalize it in a form that you can understand and remember. The book I sourced this from and use is Anne Wise's High Performance Mind. Note that I didn't really see any double-blind papers cited in there. I can only offer anecdoptal evidence that the techniques in there works for me. YMMV.",1239976692

566915,comment,566542,566844,0,0,bsaunder,,,"Oh, I'm right there with you on the IDE v editor issue (maybe vim though).  My point is that the daily life of a (typical IDE) programmer in 2009 is very different than one of an emacs developer of the 60s/70s.  I agree there has been a lot of useless reimplementation going on (make works just fine for me thanks).  But on the whole I think we tend to think in higher level concepts (regardless of our editor choice).<p>I've also noticed an increasing trend of migrating code to data (though I'm not sure the ones doing it realize this).  In the LISP world they are one and the same (as I understand), in most modern programming languages, there's a pretty binary boundary between code and data that people are trying to work around all of the time by ""evaling"" code or introspection and various other meta-programming techniques.<p>I believe it should be a continuous space.  I think LISP supports this better than most languages.  I agree there's definitely a back-to-the-future notion here.  But I think the back swing is likely to have an alternate UI to it (in additional to the normal S-expression syntax for us die hard give-me-a-text-editor people).",1239976397

Look on the second article for the precise neuroscience.<p>In summary, the pre-frontal cortex has (at least) two different mode: focused attention, and juxtapositional thinking. The first works well when you have predictable task order. You know precisely what steps you need to do something in. However, it also shuts down any chance you have to be ""inspired"" or ""creative"". It is the precise reason when you <i>try</i> to be creative, you stop being creative.<p>The site lists some easy ways to encourage juxtapositional thinking in people. There are other methods I have found help trigger this.<p>I do want to point out though, the juxtapositional state will not automatically make you more creative, though it is a pre-condition that needs to be fulfilled before you creative insight pops up in your head.<p>However, this precondition does show why creativity is difficult to teach. It is something you <i>learn</i>, not something you teach. It requires a state of mind that you have to access yourself, you cannot be simply be told ""be creative"".<p>Whatever the case may be, creativity is <i>not</i> a genetic or an edge case.",1239976365

It has to do with changes in the relative popularity of various programming styles. As witnessed by this sentence of yours:<p><i>Many of these notions also seem to fit comfortably in LISP</i><p>That's probably true, but you're talking about a language which was invented in 1958 and implemented in the early 1960s. The Lisp hackers had the equivalent of IDEs and modern programming environments in the 1970s, if not before. They are not especially impressed by our modern programming tools. (And many of us actually prefer to do our programming using tools descended from theirs, like emacs.)<p>Even the old Lisp hands who helped <i>invent</i> (e.g.) Java are not particularly impressed. As Guy Steele, co-author of the Java spec and former author of the Common Lisp spec, famously said of Java:<p>""We were not out to win over the Lisp programmers; we were after the C++ programmers. We managed to drag a lot of them about halfway to Lisp.""<p>The outer surface of programming has changed a lot over the last fifty years, and Moore's Law, the buildout of our infrastructure, the increasing sophistication of computer users, and the general growth in the population of programmers has changed the nature of the problem space many times, but the essence of the task hasn't really changed all that much.

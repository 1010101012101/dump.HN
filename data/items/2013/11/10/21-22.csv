6708631,comment,6706647,6706647,1,0,woutervdb,,,"Another day, another new programming language that compiles to [popular language]. I&#x27;m sorry, I may be looking at this from the wrong perspective, but in my opinion, they&#x27;re starting to lose their value. Sure, accessing a hard language (like C, or Python (for me, I find Python difficult at times) by writing your own dialect or higher-level language can be fun and <i>maybe</i> can make your workflow better, for me it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Actually, I view these higher-level languages as the program that ships with a Raspbery Pi (don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called, sorry), which uses a drag and drop interface to create loops and create a game. You&#x27;ll learn the basics of programming, but having a company where everyone speaks their own higher-level language won&#x27;t really work. You&#x27;re especially f<i></i>ked if you&#x27;ve got a developer that has to read the generated code, in a <i>lot</i> of cases.<p>Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;m still genuinely interested in the purpose of such languages!",1384120757
6708630,comment,6704377,6707588,6,0,gaius,,,"There is a kids TV show here in the UK called Blue Peter, it&#x27;s been running for decades. I&#x27;m not sure who Blue Peter actually was (the show is presented by a man, and woman, a cat and a dog) but anyone British will have watched it regularly growing up.<p>One day back in the 80s Blue Peter decided it was going to do something about discrimination against what were then known as &quot;spastics&quot; (I will use the term as it is <i>historically</i> correct). So they got someone on called Joey Deacon (see, I can still remember the name) to show that they were just normal people despite their physical condition.<p>It backfired spectacularly. The next day in the playground, &quot;Joey&quot; was the insult of choice. Now this may just be because kids are stupid and cruel but there is a lesson there: you can&#x27;t do social engineering by clumsy attempts to manipulate language. It just doesn&#x27;t work. So (for example) nowadays when we hear that a kid has ADHD, everyone just rolls their eyes and knows perfectly well that is just the PC way to say &quot;bad parenting&quot;.",1384120754

But TED talks aren&#x27;t a good model to emulate for formal presentations. It&#x27;s great if you have an awesome punchline with a jaw dropping assertion, but most presentations don&#x27;t. Just think about it how much of the details from the TED talks you have watched do you really remmember. That&#x27;s not what TED talks are for. They are meant to push the viewers into deeper self research by attracting them with just a tiny dose of hyperbole.<p>And frankly most day-to-day presentations and even most pitches understandably don&#x27;t have something jaw-dropping to talk about, or else they would attract a TED talk, no? If you&#x27;re giving a pitch, chances are you have to convince the investor/audience with an almost complete narrative. Having a story framework is useful, but it has to have enough information that backs your assertions, which is not true for a TED talk. Data is important, but the art is in the way you present them. Having no data might point that you don&#x27;t have a strong case, or just didn&#x27;t care. So have one or two convincing data representations.<p>And slides are important, to help you say what you wont be able to say verbally and the second to guide the audience about the structure of your presentation. Most people aren&#x27;t great story tellers. It&#x27;s an art which few can be trained in.

Instead of asking why I hold an observation to be true (thus, allowing me to make an argument <i>for</i> it), you immediately go on the offense, forcing me to rebuttal your arguments.

Bonds become overbought, so investors shift to stocks and shares, lifting the stock market. Investors benefit, as do companies seeking to raise funds through share issues, but uninvested consumers do not. As a result, the stock market goes up, and borrowing costs for companies go down, but the &quot;Real&quot; economy stagnates. Companies can borrow easily to fund expansion, but have no real market to sell into, because the stock market is disconnected from the underlying &quot;main street&quot; economy. Basic income provides another mechanism for Keynesian reflation, but targets the &quot;real&quot; economy rather than the stock market, so stimulates actual demand, rather than pumping up the bubble. Of course, inflation is a massive risk with both of these strategies ... and may happen more directly and more quickly with the basic income strategy rather than with QE ... so on second thoughts ... it might not be too great an idea.",1384118216

I tried, really hard, for six months, to participate and get something out of it, but it was just a huge time waster so I wiped it.<p>Although supposedly youtube is only (or mostly) used for trash talking comments on kitten videos, I have occasionally gotten actual useful data and experiences from youtube.  Programming screencasts and the like.  Also the videos I watch and comment on are of a professional-ish level I like being associated with.<p>So I&#x27;m finding the outrage hard to generate.  If the whole world finds out my real name liked a university video lecture about simulating a vibrating 2-D plane using multiple stack computers solving differential eqs instantiated on a FPGA as a lab exercise at Columbia, well, I&#x27;m not going to ragequit youtube over it.  In fact I think thats just great.<p>Its their property; if they want to drastically change its culture (to something I happen to prefer) its hard for me to feel bad about it.  There was a cheesy falling apart barn nearby the Interstate not too far from where I live.  The new owners painted it; outrage from traditionalists who would rather see it torn down than painted.  What do I care, other than I happen to like the new paint job?  If the complainers don&#x27;t like it, they can put up their own antique barn and let it decay unpainted, or they could have bought the old barn.<p>The original author didn&#x27;t like that the rabbit bathing video site decided to dump him, so shout out, you can&#x27;t dump me because I&#x27;m dumping you first.  Well all this high school dating drama is amusing for me to watch, but I have a FPGA video to get back to watching.  And if someone finds out, that&#x27;s OK with me.<p>Unlike facebook, youtube can demand a fair trade because its content is actually worth something.  OK here&#x27;s my real name, now let me watch something useful.<p>This might be the end of youtube as we know it, as a complete waste of time, I mean.

And of course this is not a solved problem, not by a long shot. Truly unbiased IQ tests are an open problem, and then there&#x27;s a whole extra layer of exactly what IQ is, why it&#x27;s worth measuring, and what it leaves out.<p>By all means, discuss the data.

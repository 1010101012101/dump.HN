But then we have to ask if institutions of higher education are effective at all, and economically efficient if shown to be effective, at providing learning. Learning is a wonderful thing, but much of learning occurs outside school walls, and some very socially useful learning doesn't gain the learner a credential such as a Ph.D.",1236487753

I know that it's fashionable to bash higher education in this forum, but an economy that's driven by technological progress takes more than high-school kids who know Python and HTML.  At any rate, I sincerely hope that this isn't the first generation where education no longer correlates positively with economic success.<p>That said, I agree that Universities are taking advantage of naive young people -- especially when it comes to PhD programs.  But if we're going to have a serious discussion about the flaws in higher education <i>system</i>, we have to start from the premise that higher education is itself a virtue.",1236487027

If nothing else, it's more likely to be long lived because it makes URL redirection easier in the future if the system changes.  When version 2 of the site software comes out, someone can easily redirect all the /profile urls to a legacy system or parse them into the new system.  Whereas a flat namespace is much harder to migrate and keep constant.<p>And besides, we shouldn't confuse the two issues of readable URLs and short alias URLs.  Both have very legitimate uses.",1236486828

I find it hard to believe that your formula is more effective than 1-3mg of melatonin when the time comes to sleep.<p>Is it the particular combination of ingredients that is so effective? It doesn't seem like any of the individual ingredients would have much of an impact. It doesn't mean you don't have a business model though, you have very nice packaging and there is currently no package on the shelves that treat jetlag.<p>It would complicate dosing instructions, but would not bundling your product with 1mg of melatonin to take when it comes to sleep dramatically improve effectiveness?<p>Edit: After reading the testimonials on your site, it seems that you are not trying to (supplement) sleep cycle issues, but are dealing with the fatigue and haziness one feels after flying for 18 hours. I would believe your product helps with that.",1236486644

Using Sinatra, and potentially Juno, there is a hard line: we don't do ORMs. We don't do y. We don't do z. I find that useful and refreshing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy writing for each given <i>because</i> they have differences. It sometimes took me a while to pick up on the subtleties. :)<p>To suggest creating a framework that does less than other frameworks is the soup du jour isn't quite on. I'm loving Sinatra because it does what I need: routing. I'm using other tools to bite into git as a data store and Haml for views. It makes me giddy. Each part works the way I think or the problem I needed to solve. To expect one framework to fit all criteria is a tall order.",1236485704

239901,comment,239881,239881,0,0,edw519,,,"Interesting concept.  Certainly struck a nerve with me.<p>I've found one of the easiest ways to minimalize my code is to <i>require</i> less code.<p>How?  Better program <i>design</i>.  Tighter structure, more efficient algorithms to accomplish to same thing.  Reverse the order of two functions and suddenly that conditional is no longer necessary.  Adding a parameter to a function may make it larger, but useful in more places.  Only handle 90% of cases and send the outliers off to custom-land.  You get the idea.<p>It then becomes a whole lot easier to minimalize 50 LOC than 100 LOC.<p>[EDIT: The timing of this post couldn't have been better.  I struggled with some pretty complex code all day yesterday.  I woke up at 5 a.m. and thought, ""Just switch the order the functions are called.""  I did and it simplified beautifully, working perfectly, and eliminating about 50 LOC.]",1215529057

It is because Firefox base system has always been kept to the bare minimals else they could have included all the usually used plugins & extensions like Flash player, Real Player, Java Runtime Environment, etc<p>As for shipping with Google Toolbar, the author shouldn't be bothered about this fact since the are two versions: with google toolbar pre-installed and without google toolbar. And you can choose what you want.<p>Yahoo! too shipped IE7 with Yahoo Toolbar. IE as fas as I know uses MSN's ""page not found"" (I have IE6 on XP and haven't bothered to update it since I use Firefox)<p>And for using Google as the default search engine, all my non-tech friends know is ""internet is google"". The moment they need something... Go to firefox address bar and type google.com<p>Even though other search engines are beginning to have clutter free pages homepages like Google. Its Google that made its mark first with the both - good results and clutter free pages - and quickly won users(most of them now being loyal followers of any 'good' and necessary G product).",1215527706

In fact, of all the different types of people I've known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.""<p>Well, he certainly didn't refute the first sentence.  Arguing that other things have a lot in common with hacking doesn't prove that painting doesn't.  And I don't see how either you or he could say anything about the second.  You don't know who I know.  And I didn't even say they were the most alike of people I'd known, only among the most alike.<p>You both pretend I'd written ""Hacking has more in common with painting than any other field.""  But if I'd meant that, I would have said it.<p>In fact, I say explicitly that what hackers have in common with painters is that they're both makers, and I mention other types of makers (writers and architects) who are also like hackers.  The kinds of work I claim hacking is unlike are math and science, which I think is an important point, because lots of people have tried to push it into the mold of one or the other.<p>Now that's settled, will you answer my original question?  Can you give me an example of a specific statement about painting that he's refuted?  Not (what he claims is) the thesis of my essay, but one of the statements I make specifically about painting.  As you point out, he attacks these ""repeatedly and explicitly,"" with footnotes.  I'm asking you to produce just one you feel is convincing,\nto support your claim that he has ""carefully refuted"" me.<p>The reason I'm asking is because I think you'll find, when you look more closely, that you've been convinced by the form of his arguments (the emphatic tone, the citations) without actually understanding them.

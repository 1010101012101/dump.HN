Usually when we put up a small smoke fire under the tree , the ants will scram. After reaching a branch , someone will throw a rope up and I tie the rope around the jackfruit and wrap it around a branch sort of acting as a pully system. Once the person in the ground has got a good grip on the rope. I cut the fruit and the person on the ground slowly releases the rope bringing the fruit down slowly.<p>This is useful especially when the fruit is very ripe as it likely to smash into pieces on impact.

10255837,comment,10252123,10255471,0,0,shas3,,,"> Do you see the same thing happening in India, or are they managing to preserve local tradition alongside the mainstream?<p>It is complex! Some dialects are dying out, but the regions seem to be clustering around the 22 &#x27;scheduled languages&#x27;. In Karnataka (population ~ 60 million) for example, there are at least 4 dialects of Kannada. With the proliferation of social media, TV, and cinema, two things are happening: (1) the non-majority dialects are losing out to a &#x27;standardized&#x27; mean similar to the Wisconsin-mean in the US, (2) paradoxically, non-standard dialects are gaining popularity because of their quirks. This is similar to how Irish dialects are highlighted in movies like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, In Bruges, etc. giving them more visibility than it would otherwise get. Another analogy is how we all know about Minnesotan &#x27;dialects&#x27; and Californian dude-isms from Coen brothers&#x27; explorations of these themes.<p>The primary bulwark against the disappearance of dialects and languages in India is just the largeness of the masses of people who speak these languages. For example, Bhojpuri, a dialect that is different from standardized movie/TV &#x27;Hindi&#x27; has tens of millions of speakers.<p>Somehow standardized languages seem to co-exist with dialects in much of India.<p>It is nearly impossible that any of the 22 languages will die out in the next few centuries. Even most dialects will survive because of the strength in numbers. (Note, the 22 languages includes Sanskrit, which like Latin and classical Greek has in some sense &#x27;died out&#x27;.

You can sit back on your unlimited money makers, receive hundreds of billions of dollars in profit, then just hoard it.

You could imagine a 55&quot; television in the 70s but you could not cost effectively manufacture one.<p>Another way to think about it is how computer games today on the PS4 or the Xbox would be inconcievable on the DEC-10 or the IBM 370 in the 70&#x27;s. The GPUs themselves were simply to complex to imagine, much less design, simulate, and fabricate. Get your hands on state of the art &quot;demo reels&quot; from the Siggraph conferences in the 70&#x27;s early 80&#x27;s. Compare that to Renderman. There is no comparison.<p>I think as Peter gets older and has participated in bringing more technologies from concept to product, he will evolve his thinking where he understands the entire stack of things that have to be in place for something to occur, this &quot;eco-system&quot; if you will, which has to all be present before progress can be made.

So clearly someone can make it more cheaply. I get that Sigma is research chemicals not medical grade, but seems to me someone could figure this out. FDA approval must be the issue.

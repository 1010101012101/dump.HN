Are you telling me that switching between Live IDs is magically easier (it's not, it's amazingly easy to be ""logged in"" to a Live site without a logout button, especially when you mixed an XBL account in there).<p>It's just that Google is the one site large enough to have users that NEED multiple accounts and have reasons to switch between them. You're arguing against the cookie model and the fact that modern browsers are still complete shit at managing an identity and related cookies.<p>(edit)Rambling here, with the new Cookie API in Chrome, would it not be possible to switch between profiles quickly using an extension? I understand the frustation is that we want to have one tab/window with one account and one with another, but this solution could surely mitigate some use cases.<p>Also, I hope my comments aren't interpreted the wrong way.

2948585,comment,2947203,2947203,2,0,EGreg,,,"The purpose of patents, as I understand it, is to propose a compromise in order to promote innovation: the company which publicly discloses its non-obvious innovations through a patent is granted a MONOPOLY RIGHT by the government, and enforced by the courts, to prevent anyone else from implementing this invention without paying licenses. (Depending on the country, they may be forced to offer licensing, or not.)<p>In the software industry, patents are unnecessary. Because whatever is patented, even if it is not obvious WHEN patented, it (or a variant of it that falls under the patent) nevertheless becomes OBVIOUS to lots of people a mere 3-4 years later. Therefore, we can easily explain how a 20-year monopoly has wound up HURTING the industry rather than helping it. Companies implement an invention WITHOUT rummaging through new patents that come out every year. It is obvious that most of the stuff implemented in the software industry was arrived at in a different way. Non-practicing entities can sue those who actually implemented the invention 3-4 years later. Meanwhile, those who implemented it, get hit with a suit.<p>Therefore, patents have now become a tax on innovation.<p>I repeat: the inventions were not obvious AT THE TIME THEY WERE PATENTED. And, those who ultimately implemented them DID NOT READ THE PATENTS in order to get the idea for the invention. Therefore the system is not serving its purpose.<p>Patents are an exchange between the inventor and the public. The inventor discloses how an invention works, and in return gets a monopoly for 20 years so that no one else can implement it.<p>In open source, the IMPLEMENTOR not only discloses a theoretical thing but actually builds it AND releases all the inner workings of it, AND others can build on top of it. So we get the upside with no monopoly. Why do we need the latter, then, if so much innovation happens without it?",1314848955

The case is even more extreme in Africa, where there are huge numbers of small cellular carriers with redundant infrastructure.<p>During the early 90's many telecom companies either had protected monopoly status or were government owned. Neither worked well, because disruptive technology meant that they were undercut in price by newer competitors which were also able to offer new, innovative services that the incumbents could not - or would not - match.<p>Cellular network infrastructure isn't like roads, pipes or train tracks where you build it and then maintain it forever.

2948564,comment,2945787,2947422,2,0,Dan_Nguyen,,,"(Bear in mind I'm going into biomedical research, which is a very different field than CS or Entrepreneurship, which seem to make up the majority of HN users)<p>For me it's not the fear of not fitting in, per se, but the loneliness that comes with being misunderstood by those around you.<p>I find that the point he made of not being understood when I started to pursue my career aspirations rings very true. I wouldn't blame others' inability to understand on ignorance so much as lack of experience, in that not that many people have experienced the biomedical research field for themselves, so therefore have no way of understanding the nuances or the lifestyle of it all beyond hearsay.<p>That lack of understanding in turn leads to an inability to connect with me, or conversely, an inability for me to connect with most people. My career takes up the majority of my time and thoughts, and as a result is one of the most important aspects of my own life. When people are unable to understand that, they in effect do not understand me as a person.<p>Furthermore, there's the fact that I and other people who want very badly to accomplish their dreams are often very hardworking. A bit anecdotal, but I've also found that the people who are physically in my life are by far not driven to work as hard as I do. I find a sense of happiness working 12 hours in a research lab and coming in on weekends. The ""average"" person in my life, however, is the sort of person who looks at a career as a means to make money; a commitment they only have to fulfill between the hours of 9AM and 5PM on weekdays. Anything beyond that (time after work, weekends, etc.) should be dedicated to partying and the like.<p>Going back to the point I was making before: these differences in personalities between myself and almost everyone in my life makes it almost impossible for me to truly connect with someone.<p>And for reasons I can't really explain beyond ""human nature"", even though it makes perfectly logical sense to focus on my work and be as efficient as possible, I find that interpersonal connections to be something I cannot live without. For me, there is immense comfort to be had in being able to talk to people about your life (which again for me mostly revolves around work) and have a true understanding of it all.<p>I'm very lucky enough to have a small yet very close group of friends who are like that (although mostly online due to college; thank you internet). However in the past two years I've already fell out of contact with most of my friends because of my shift from (and I do apologize as I can't think of a better term) a commonplace life to one that is unorthodox to most people. So a big lingering fear of mine is, ""If I continue on with my goals, will I still have anyone in my life I can connect with?"" While so far the answer has been ""yes"", the past two years still leave a very strong, lingering fear in the back of my mind. And while it's very true that I've come into contact with and maintain a personal relationship with many people above me and have gone through the same path as me, for me it's no replacement for having people in your life that are going through the same life challenges that you're experiencing yourself. As the saying goes, ""Misery loves company"".<p>On a more minor note unrelated to the article, another sort of fear I've felt (and am still feeling) is really fear of the unknown. I was the sort of person who did just enough in my life. I'd go so far as to say I was complacent with myself. This whole lifestyle of being ambitious, proactive, and actively and constantly working towards a dream that once felt unobtainable to you is all a new experience. Others above me/more experienced than me have told me stories about their own lives but in the end actually going through with the life yourself is completely different than hearing stories about it. For me, everything I'm doing now is new, unfamiliar, unknown, and as a result it's nerve wracking and scary.<p>While I know that everything above is not universal and there will be others on HN that have different experiences/viewpoints, these are my honest viewpoints shaped by my own experiences in my life. I hope this helped with your question.",1314848279

FIRST OFFICER: Don't you think it rains more? In this area, here?<p>The first officer must have thought long and hard before making that comment. [...] Among Korean Air flight crews, the expectation on layovers used to be that the junior officers would attend to the captain to the point of making him dinner or purchasing him gifts. As one former Korean Air pilot puts it [...] ""the captain is in charge and does what he wants, when he likes, how he likes, and everyone else sits quietly and does nothing.""<p>[...]<p>So when the first officer says, ""Don't you think it rains more? In this area, here?"" we know what he means by that:<p>Captain. You have committed us to visual approach, with no backup plan, and the weather outside is terrible. You think that we will break out of the clouds in time to see the runway. But what if we don't? It's pitch-black outside and pouring rain and the glide scope is down.
""""""<p>The plane crashes not because of any individual error, but rather because the culture aboard the plane is weak in a tragically important area plane flight: communicating errors.<p>So imagine my surprise when I see this post on the bug tracker:  ""Ehsan, are you going to be able to pick this up again? If not, let's find a new owner.""<p>In an open source project, you don't pay people in money. They're paid in intrinsic motivation. For that reason, it can be very dangerous to do things that would be commonplace in a business. For example, pulling someone off a task and reassigning it to someone else. I would read that post as ""Ehsan, can you fix this or should I assign it to someone else?""<p>And I would read his reply as ""No, I don't think I can without extra help"". But no help comes, because the discussion is wrapped in social code to avoid appearing incapable or ordering someone around, neither of which are really acceptable in an open source project.<p>I suspect that this represents a general trend, and much of the reason why good design has come so late to the picture for Linux, when it seems to fall so naturally out of everything Apple touches. The culture in open source is a kind of loose-knit collective individualism, which means leadership in open source looks a lot like gardening: your main function is to tend the soil and stop the plants from strangling each other.<p>But design necessarily requires autocratic leadership - a person or persons whose vision for the product subsumes the priorities of any individual working on it. As a thought experiment, imagine if everyone's favourite ex-Apple CEO was faced with this bug. I can't help but imagine him kicking in someone's door and screaming ""Why isn't it fixed? What do you need? Don't understand XBL? Here's the guy who writes the event handler. Neither of you are leaving until it's done. Namaste.""<p>That's a good way to lose contributors, but it would get the bug fixed. I don't think Mozilla would necessarily be a better organisation with more screaming but, like Korean culture has a characteristic failure mode (problems that would have been impolite to fix), open source has its own characteristic failure mode: a problem that would have been solved if someone cared enough.",1314847518

You've been doing it since the day you picked up your first programming language, after all. And in <i>theory</i>, C arrays are perfectly safe because you will always pass around their lengths and check the length every time you so much as glance at the array, but in practice it's hopeless and the only practical solution for mere mortals is <i>Don't do that</i>. STM actually suffers from this even worse because if you actually want to take advantage of the composition promises (and if you aren't getting that why bother with STM in the first place), it only takes one bad case in one block of code, with no feedback to the programmer that an untracked effect has occurred at any point, to bring the whole thing down. One of the whole points is that you can write transactional code that calls other transactional code and it's all supposed to Just Work in a way lock-based code can't be composed together, so a single transaction may run all over the program just like a single function call can.<p>I can't hardly get my coworkers to properly encode their HTML, and you expect me to teach them about managing effects in a language that doesn't even acknowledge they exist as a distinct category of things?<p>You can solve this by adding a concept of ""effect"" to your language, as Haskell does... but once you do that, you no longer have the same language. Not even close. None of the old libraries will work, more semantics will have to be tweaked, the change will ripple everywhere in both semantics and probably syntax, new coding patterns will have to be learned (and worse, unlearned!)... unless someone's come up with a <i>really</i> big breakthrough that everybody up to this point has missed.<p>It's not a hardware problem, it's a <i>semantic</i> problem.",1314846614

It is really rare among professional investors.  It might happen again at the private equity level, where established businesses are being restructured, but there you could argue the value is not with the founders in all cases, or with management.  I have little experience at that scale though.<p>In a startup, the founders, and their relationship with each other and the company, is probably the biggest asset.  If an investor doesn't like the team, he just won't invest at all.",1314846456

My requests...<p>1) Add all of the menu commands to the list of commands that show up when you press cmd-shift-p. It is very weird that some of the named commands (like convert to spaces) are available via cmd-shift-p, but others (like switch to 1 column view) are not.<p>2) I prefer the way textmate does multiple selection, where you can press a single key to toggle between regular selection mode and block selection mode.<p>Using cmd-shift-up/down in sublime text is very unpredictable. It works fine in the case you have several consecutive lines with no extra newlines in-between, but that is about it.<p>Though cmd-d to multi-select the next same word is pretty awesome.<p>3) Easier navigation between tabs in differnt split columns. I never remember the keys to switch between columns and I feel the existing normal tab management keys could do the job with a couple of tweaks.<p>For example, cmd-t is awesome, but I wish it was smart enough to automatically switch to an existing tab instead of opening a new tab with the same file in it.<p>Also, make cmd-shift-{ and cmd-shift-} move across all tabs and not just the tabs inside the currently selected column.<p>4) And lastly, the find in project results desperately need syntax coloring. It is so hard to scan a giant blob of plain white text.<p>Ackmate style file types would be nice too, but that isn't to big of a deal.<p>Again, awesome stuff. I can't wait to try out the vim bindings and I hope he keeps up the good work!",1314846241

2948487,comment,2947918,2947918,2,0,frankus,,,"The problem is that legalization (like alcohol) is different from decriminalization (like pot in the Netherlands) in both the effect on use and the effect on crime. Too often authors like this one will pick and choose the best or worst attributes of each to match their conclusion.<p>This article cites the small or negative impact on use that decriminalization has had in Portugal and then jumps straight into how legalization (e.g. after Prohibition ended) has resulted in a drop in crime.<p>But there is no reason to suspect that full legalization wouldn't result in a situation similar to what we have currently with alcohol. That is to say pervasive use and abuse, lavish marketing campaigns, and really awful effects on public health and safety. Not to mention  regulatory capture by the industry, where even modest policy changes (like raising the federal tax on alcohol) are pretty much a non-starter.<p>Likewise, there is little reason to suspect that decriminalization (of use and possession of small amounts) would do much to reduce drug-related crime, both by dealers and by those users who don't have a rock band or trust fund to support their habit. And you can't really tax a substance that is not legal to sell. And it does nothing to improve the safety or purity of street drugs. Basically all it does is put fewer non-violent users behind bars.<p>That might be worth it, but don't keep bringing up the benefits of legalization when you're arguing for decriminalization.",1314846164

The surge in visual programming just resulted in developing the same logic with less powerful tools in languages that were not designed for programming (XML and in this case JSON).<p>These kind of tools focus on the wrong side of the problem. It is not about how to connect the nicely designed services, but how to actually get services to be nicely designed. Once you have service that can be easily connected in the visual tool, it can be trivially used from the conventional programming language as well.<p>Reasons why services can not be just trivially composed include:<p><pre><code>  - every service that is comprehensively mapping real problem is inherently complex \n  (even for seemingly simple things like address geocoding)\n  - any two services will have slightly different APIs \n  (consider various signatures of substring method in various languages)\n   and oftentimes the backend system details \n  - limitations are leaking over the service API\n  (datatypes, formats, paging, ...). \n</code></pre>\nFor these reason there exists the large branch of programming that deals with integrating services (sometimes called Enterprise System Integration) that basically wraps, formats and preprocesses data before shoving them to the target service.<p>For restricted domains - it could probably work.

Here&#x27;s my experience from combating the same problem:<p>You can talk to your conscious mind all you want. Won&#x27;t help. Your subconscious mind will reign supreme. Always.\nSo you need to re-program the subconscious. Eliminate the emotional drivers behind your procrastination. See 2). below for one such method.\nThink of it as an unfair message bus. Without cheating, it takes a lot of work to pass messages from the conscious mind down to the subconscious mind but messages from the subconscious are effortlessly running your conscious life - and mostly, you don&#x27;t even realize.<p>So what to do?\n1). calm your minds (both of them) through meditation. Sit for 12 minutes a day in a comfy, non-disturbed place, and focus on your breathing. When a thought pops up, simply acknowledge it and return to focusing on breathing. Resist the urge to pursue those trains of thought. This will strengthen your ability to focus.<p>2). get familiar with EFT (Emotional Freedom Therapy). Its easy to do and as an offshoot from acupuncture/acupressure, it involves finger-tapping on specific acupuncture points on the face and torso.\nMany people dismiss EFT as silly pseudoscience but it does prove to be remarkably effective at eliminating undesired behavior by acting on the deep subconscious circuits.

Keep in mind that while I&#x27;m an active contributor, I don&#x27;t speak on behalf of the core/security teams.<p>The aforementioned bug is in the phpass library used in WordPress. As fun as implementing our own cryptography is, we use the phpass library to abstract ourselves from this. Personally, I&#x27;d say this is something that phpass should be handling, as the use of crypt_private() is an implementation detail that we shouldn&#x27;t need to know or worry about.<p>(This is also an issue that affects a small portion of sites, as &quot;Exploitation of this vulnerability is possible only when there is at least one password protected post on the blog.&quot;)<p>As to the response from the security team (which is not exactly the core team), that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve called them out on before. Security is a serious issue that is usually handled very well on WP&#x27;s behalf, but there have been a few notable instances lately where it&#x27;s not.<p>(Also, the reason I &quot;narrow down&quot; the answers is because there are smaller &quot;security&quot; issues that tend to boil down to &quot;admins can do anything&quot;, which is intentional.)",1375432447
6145933,comment,6145261,6145261,3,0,jhuckestein,,,"I often struggled with this as well. When you go through life with practically no effort and somehow achieve many things that are hard for others, it&#x27;s easy to feel guilty. Especially because most of our parent&#x27;s generation lived their lives diligently working 8 hours a day, advancing their career, eventually settling down etc and that seems to be the expectation for us as well. I&#x27;d just not worry about it and live your life the way you think works best.<p>One thing that helped me was to stop thinking &quot;How can I get myself to work 8 hours a day?&quot; and start thinking &quot;What fun, useful things can I do with the 8 hours a day I&#x27;m not working.?&quot; The only reason I read the internet and played flash games all day was because I was supposed to be at my computer, working. Overall that&#x27;s a pretty low-fun and low-reward activity, though. If you accept that you won&#x27;t work more than 3 hours anyway, you can do much more engaging/fun/interesting things with the rest of the time.<p>You mention that you wish you&#x27;d done more sports. Great, start doing sports. With your income, you can easily get a gym trainer or trainer in any sport you&#x27;d like to learn. Set yourself the goal to complete a mini triathlon next year, join a recreational volleyball league or anything else you like. You can also learn how to cook really well, enroll in a language school (for human languages), volunteer to teach kids how to code, etc. Those are all things that you&#x27;ll probably enjoy and that I&#x27;m much less likely to procrastinate. Learn how to play an instrument or sing (again, you can afford a teacher to get off the ground) or pick up a hobby closer to your work like electrical engineering. The possibilities are endless once you accept that you&#x27;re not &quot;supposed to&quot; work all day; unless you want to, and that day will come.<p>You can even take it one step further and just up and leave. Spend a few years traveling every corner of the world and earn your keep with a day or two of contracting each month. I know nobody who&#x27;s done that who&#x27;d consider it a waste of time in any sense of the word.<p>Hope this helps and best of luck. Don&#x27;t be so hard on yourself.",1375432394

Many larger stores also have facilities for batteries, but I&#x27;m unsure how many uses them as most people I know toss them in with the general waste.<p>It has also been tried many times to separate organic matter from the rest (different colour of bags), and using automatic systems to sort it. It has been mostly dropped because it&#x27;s more expensive than just burning everything unfortunately. Which brings me to the main point. We can be very efficient and recycle most of the waste, find a optimum point where we minimize the environmental footprint - it&#x27;s just expensive, and the first thing to go when the city need to save money. People just don&#x27;t care about future generations, or don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a problem, to accept the cost of recycling.",1375432019

It&#x27;s pretty standard procedure to log out a recently departed employee&#x27;s accounts and revoke all of their permissions, and it&#x27;s not a big stretch to assume some sort of simple audit of their recent activity.  Did they have any partially-completed work sitting on their desktop?  Were they still logged in to the billing system?  Did they have anything checked out?  I can imagine an IT guy at a smallish company sitting down at the console and finding a browser window still open with a handful of work tabs, and a tab of google search results, and noticing the google search results are a little bit suspicious.",1375431027

If it finds a TEXT field it throws its hands in the air and joins on disk, taking great care to avoid any indexes you might have added to speed up those joins.<p>Any time the query cache isn&#x27;t there to save you, you wind up stomping around on disk anyway. Fun fact: the recent comments widget that ships in mainline blows the query cache.<p>Secondly, file caching could still ship in mainline with a tickbox to enable it.<p>Thirdly, I&#x27;ve never seen a site that wasn&#x27;t improved by file caching.

6145871,comment,6141641,6142926,3,0,yason,,,"In Finland, neighbouring Sweden, we also have more different containers for different trash than you&#x27;d care for. It takes time to learn all that and when you&#x27;ve finally sorted out all your trash properly to different bins, you sit on your balcony and look at the garbage truck reversing to the yard. The guy goes inside the garbage shed and brings out one bin of certain color, empties it in the truck, and drives away to the next address only to come back a few days later to do the same. When your mind accidentally multiplies this activity by the number of different colored bins you have there, you begin to imagine the local emissions produced by these different trucks circling around all the time, emptying one type of trash each. There are so many bins that each of them must be rather small, so the <i>buffering capacity</i> of the garbage sheds causes excess traffic and pollution due to regular visits by the garbage trucks. Further, some things are collected in certain recycling points, such as non-returnable glass waste like jars and olive oil bottles, which means people take them there with private cars!<p>For a long time we used to have general waste and compostables. That was quite understandable because you really want the compostables into a separate heap because of...well, composting and you can produce bio gas off composts if the percentage of decomposing waste is high enough. But I&#x27;m pretty sure the separation of glass, wood, papers, cardboards etc. could be done in some automated way that reaches a good enough success rate that would make it economically and ecologically viable.",1375430910

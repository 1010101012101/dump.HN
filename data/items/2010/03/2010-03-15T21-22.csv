Something has to make the hydrogen (or hydrocarbon) to power them. Also, fuel cells use platinum as a catalyst. You know, rare expensive stuff that has to be dug out of the ground, processed, and refined before it can be shipped to factories that build fuel cells.<p>Living off the grid would require land for solar cells and/or wind turbines, and energy storage mechanisms for when it's neither sunny nor windy. Building this stuff requires factories (again), raw materials (again), infrastructure, and R&D. A small community can't afford these things. And that's just for basic stuff like electricity and transportation. The small communities could solve this by banding together and contributing resources to a collective pool. Some sort of federated system...<p><i>Faced with the burden of financing the decades-long retirement of aging boomers, many of the young embrace a new underground economy, a largely untaxed archipelago of communes, co-ops, and kibbutzim that passively resist the power of the granny state while building their own little utopias.</i><p>So... what happens to the old people? How do these small communities trade? I'm guessing quite a few will be landlocked. If trade is limited, how do these little utopias have modern medicine? An MRI machine needs to be topped up with liquid helium to maintain its superconducting coils (which are manufactured in factories-blah blah blah). Contrast agents use rare elements like gadolinium.<p>The writer doesn't seem to realize just how interconnected the world economy is. Almost nothing I own was made anywhere near where I live.

There's a reason typography focuses on line length in written text - it's easier to read something if you have a decent reference point [1]. A long line makes it easier for your eyes to get off track.<p>The same thing happens in music. Dividing things into measures and lines allows our brain to ""chunk"" it. Part of the chunking mechanism is returning your visual focus to the beginning of the next line.<p>Part of reading is the connection of eye movement to new information. If you no longer need to move your eye to get a new measure/phrase/note, it's patently more difficult to notice the change. That's why marquees are useful for short lists of phrases that repeat often - and not entire articles. Maybe scrolling music might be decent for karaoke or games like guitar hero - but the information encoded into one bar of classical staff is orders of magnitude greater (and one of the reasons I despise, say, piano rolls in most digital audio authoring software).<p>Disclaimer: I have only been reading sheet music for two decades; this may or may not qualify me to comment on the benefits or detriments of an autoscrolling marquee of sheet music instead of paginated sheet music.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/em/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/em/</a>",1268688775

We certainly didn't call for the contest to be cancelled, and we had nothing to do with the lawsuit. But when some people implied that we were responsible for the mess that ensued, we were kind of pulled into it. We posted this as a way of explaining our point of view and reaching out to see if there's a possibility of collaboration.<p>* The sadness we expressed is genuine. The reason we brought up Netflix's response to our paper wasn't ""snark"" or ""gloating."" Rather, we were pointing out that the cancellation of this contest was rather needless, because if they had acknowledged the privacy risks back when we published the paper, they would have had more than enough time to deploy an opt-in system for this contest. I think it is really unfortunate that that didn't happen.<p>* Someone wanted to know exactly what I thought of the ""greater good"" argument. Well, I'll tell ya. I'm vehemently opposed to it and I think it's a dangerous slippery slope. I think this point of view is enshrined in the ethos of this country -- ""better let ten guilty men walk free than to convict one innocent man,"" etc. I don't think anyone has the moral authority to decide that the privacy concerns of a few can be sacrificed.<p>* There is a specific reason we chose the open letter format rather than communicating with Netflix directly. Acutally, two reasons. First, there are many data privacy researchers who are at least as qualified as we are for this role. We wanted to make sure the community had the opportunity to participate in whatever ensures, rather than just us.<p>Second, I'm sure there are many companies other than Netflix who have a similar need for privacy preserving data mining. If Netflix doesn't take us up, perhaps one of the others will. Bottom line, since there are multiple parties on both sides, and we don't really know who they are, we felt it is better to have this dialog in public.<p>* Finally, it is understandable when something like this happens to want to find someone to blame.

Generalizing, the problem with anonymized data sets is that it is very, VERY hard to say with confidence that the data cannot be connected to a client.<p>That kind of data should not be released without consent.",1268687343

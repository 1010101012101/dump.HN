There is no easy way to do it, I have to manually ""poll"" the item page, and it's far from optimal. The biggest problem being, I can't easily see new comments.<p>* Similarly, I'd like to be able to quickly see new submissions/comments from some users.<p>I'm planning on building a small app to remediate to this problem. Basically the plan is to provide RSS feeds for top-level items and users, so that I can quickly see new content on a RSS reader.\nMaybe I would extend this with a website that would allow you to sort comments by novelty and other things like that (+/- a HN-specific RSS reader).<p>I would like to know if someone else is interested by this idea, or if someone can point me to an already-existing solution. If there are several people interested, I would put much effort into this project, and don't make it usable only for me :-)<p>P.S: I know HN has some limitations about crawling, but I think if one almost only polls ~ once/minute the /newcomments, /news and /newest page, the amount of data could be sufficient.",1288202274

1839671,comment,1839394,1839394,0,0,ilamont,,,"Harvard used to get a lot of flack for legacy preferences. A writer named Dan Golden documented some of the ""Z-List"" rule-bending in his 2006 book, 'The Price of Admission: How America's Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges -- and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates'. Here's what the Boston Globe reviewer (<a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/09/04/harvards_admissions_of_gilt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/09/04/...</a>) had to say about the book when it came out:<p><i>Golden's book is a well-reported critique of what amounts to affirmative action for rich people, who enjoy a panoply of preferences in the college admission process that outsiders could never dream of. The best-known examples are ``legacy"" admissions for alumni children; scholarships reserved for upper-class sports, such as rowing; and the ultimate preference: dough. When you read how Harvard treats the children of its fat - cat Committee on University Resources -- who enjoy such perks as sit-downs with the director of admissions, personal campus tours, and access to the coveted ``Z-list"" of deferred applicants -- suddenly real affirmative action for people who need it doesn't seem like such a bad idea.<p>The most egregious example of pay-for-Crimson - play is that of Jared Kushner , now the youthful owner of The New York Observer. While Jared was applying to colleges, his dad, New Jersey billionaire developer Charles Kushner , pledged $2.5 million to Harvard, to be paid in installments. (Kushner pere pleaded guilty to tax evasion and other counts in 2004 and recently completed a prison sentence.) An official at Kushner's high school told Golden: ``There was no way anybody in . . . the school thought he would on the merits get into Harvard. His GPA did not warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought, for sure, there was no way this was going to happen."" Kushner graduated from Harvard in 2003.</i><p>I'd be curious to know if this is still an issue at Harvard, or any of the other Ivy League schools. Maybe the OP can talk about what happened/didn't happen at Princeton?",1288201784

There are parallels with WP7 launch but the stakes are much higher this time around because the relevance of the desktop is waning for general consumer use and Microsoft needs something to replace it. WP7 is an inflection point, if it fails I think you'll see Microsoft go roughly down the same path IBM has as far as consumer relevance (unless perhaps they turn Xbox Live into a OnLive-esque games as service thing, which they are in a better position than Sony or Nintendo to do).",1288201616

A good number of those might be of a lot of relevance to people who were not a part of the email discussion. Some quick examples:<p>-  You posted a question to a few of your colleagues. You got some responses, and after a few emails on the thread, you got your answer. This answer might be of relevance to many other people at your workplace who might have the same question that you had.<p>-  You are working on a project and using email heavily to discuss key matters on the project. A new member joins the team, and needs to have access to all these email threads.<p>-  You found a link on the internet that you think your colleagues can use. You forward this to your immediate peers over email, but do not want to send it to everyone as they might not need it immediately, and might consider the email to be spam.<p>All this is useful knowledge hidden in your inbox, which can not be useful to others, and might probably die in your inbox. GrexIt solves this problem by letting you add content from your inbox to an online shared repository, which anyone from your workplace in need of information can access. You can do this using our very intuitive and easy to use browser plugin.

You've said many times you believe the outcome of early stage investing is bimodal.  In your Startup School talk you even made a point of saying you ""did the math"" that led you to this conclusion.  You said you didn't even start to question this conclusion until you started writing the talk for the last startup school.  And this seems to be as close as you get to retreating from that conclusion:<p>""So I think at least some super-angels are looking for companies that will get bought. That's the only rational explanation for focusing on getting the right valuations, instead of the right companies. And if so they'll be different to deal with than VCs. They'll be tougher on valuations, but more accomodating if you want to sell early.""<p>This is the passage I referred to as ""grudging acknowledgement.""  A non-grudging acknowledgement would have gone something like this: ""Because angels do not operate under the same constraints that VC's do, it opens the door to exit strategies that VC's are not able to undertake because of the constraints they operate under.  This has the potential to change everything, including the current bi-modal distribution of outcomes, which is caused at least in part by the fact that VC's have to hew to a schedule and can't reinvest proceeds from early exits.  So you as founders might be able to provide very nice ROI's for your investors without really dramatic wins, as long as you can add value quickly and reliably.""  Or something like that.<p>> Whether programs process strings and whether they're visible in your source code are separate questions.<p>Of course surface syntax and internal representations are separate issues.  I challenge the claim that ""it's lame to clutter up the semantics of the language with hacks to make programs run faster.""  The semantics of the language determine, for example, whether strings are mutable, whether it's possible to take the CDR of a string, whether taking the Nth element of a string is an O(1) operation or an O(n) operation.  ""Cluttering up the semantics with hacks to make program run faster"" could save you a lot of money, and is therefore not ""lame.""  The chances that it <i>will</i> save you a lot of money is proportional to how successful you are.<p>> There is definitely a subset of opportunistic investors whose motives and character deserve to be impugned.<p>OK, but maybe you should draw the distinction a little more specifically, particularly when your audience is a bunch of aspiring first-time founders.  It is very easy to interpret what you said as, ""Anyone who gives you this line is [very likely to be? almost certain to be?] a jerk.""",1288201487

People will care about products you care about. If you're just building stuff to throw out onto the internetz and hope a few randos latch on... well, that's exactly what you'll get. If you want dedicated users who keep coming back, you'll have to steadily improve your projects, and nurture them into full-fledged awesome products. There are no shortcuts, what you put in is what you get out (usually).<p>Also, the original idea is almost never perfect. Products evolve over time, flickr didn't start as a photo site. Listen to you customers, but not too much, find the problems that REALLY need solving. Like Henry Ford said, ""if I listened to the customers, I would have made a faster horse."" What he really means that the customers wanted faster transportation, not necessarily a horse. You need that insight to see what the core problems are, and solve them in novel ways.<p><i>>>I lack visual design skills, but yet trying to do my best to provide a usable UI for the products. One of my motives in building a product against my lack of visual skills is knowing that ""they started as crap too"".</i><p>That is not good enough. Knowing you suck at UX is a good start. But justifying it by calling out reddit, twitter, and stumbleupon? That's just naive. You want to know what made them succeed? THEY GOT BETTER. They didn't sit on their ass saying ""well, those other guys suck, so I can too."" No, they were the ones saying ""I'll endlessly strive to make my product better every single day.""<p>Software adopts the personality of the developer(s). Users can tell when the developer actually loves and cares about something enough to follow through with good support and updates. Similarly, users want software that gets to the <i>core</i> of their problems, not just shallow complaints, which brings me to my next point:<p><i>>>My projects are mostly based on features that are missing or misimplemented in the existing products.</i><p>Do NOT base your software on a feature. Features are shallow, like breast implants. Build VISION and PERSONALITY into your software, and people will love you even if you're flat-chested. Again, this goes back to UX/UI and taking care of your product and helping it evolve a personality AFTER launch.",1288201415

The GP sees this failure as something else: continued unwillingness, by the corporate leadership, to seriously support these innovation efforts.  I agree.<p>If you disagree and think that Microsoft's leadership is willing to change and has just not been able to, then their leadership must be <i>phenomenally</i> incompetent.  Just ask yourself, what's their cohesive product strategy?  Where's their commitment to excellence?  How many of these research projects are designed to build on the strengths of Microsoft's offerings or fix their weaknesses?  Why aren't these research projects winnowed down into economically viable and marketable products and services?  What's the corporate vision?<p>A simpler explanation is that the leadership of Microsoft is afraid of anything that competes with their two cash cows: Windows and Office.  If this explanation is correct, then any product or service that Microsoft makes (or participates in) will be sufficiently hobbled in order to keep Windows and Office at the forefront of their offerings.  It's their ""strategy tax.""  Mobile devices and web services both compete with Windows and Office, in some way, so the company has done relatively little to advance in these two areas.<p>It doesn't matter which way you look at it, though: spending billions and having little success to show for it isn't a merit badge, it's a mark of failure.",1288200751

I am still very interested in UX though. I think starting as a programmer, I would just try to recreate designs you think are appealing. I would also try to learn the grid system. Use CSS frameworks as training wheels that have a solid grid, and decent typography (eg. Blueprint). I started constraining myself to HTML and CSS, and I think you should too, leave Photoshop alone until you can make decent designs in just HTML and CSS. Then, when you are completely comfortable using the two, then look to PS to add details that you can't achieve otherwise.

1839509,comment,1837843,1837843,0,0,TheCondor,,,"Yes, it changes absolutely everything.  I'll also say it generally makes life better, you can talk about work/life balance before a child but it takes on a completely different meaning.  It's not more time at the gym or more xbox or more time outside that you're balancing work against, it's more time with your child.  There simply isn't a comparison.  Something else, I think I was a great deal more selfish before hand, I didn't think it at the time and I never intended or wanted to be selfish and I don't think I'd have described my self as such.<p>As for work and work related things, it provides an incredible filter.  I've always had too many ideas and had to somehow filter through the bad ones but try to honor every idea to see if it's bad, you simply have less time to screw around and you either become more efficient and effective or you become more mediocre. You either embrace that or you fight it.  Where as before, I could spend 6 hours on a Saturday morning just screwing around, maybe learning a new tool or language or something, now I've got maybe 1 hour on that Saturday and I have to make that time count more.  I was maybe more oriented towards just trying stuff and seeing what happened, now I have to be a bit more thoughtful and it's not an entirely bad thing, when you just experiment and try you kind of don't excercise some parts of your mind the same way.   Some of the screwing around some how seems more satisfying now when you can actually do that.<p>In some ways,  it redefines ""success.""  I've had mentors and peers that have sort of fallen in to two camps.  1 camp says entrepreneurship is a young man's game,  it's countless really long weeks, doing every job you have to to get the company to work, you might just have to grind,  at some point you either want to have a life or burn out and then you're done. You might have to choose between a marriage and your buisness.  The other camp insists that it's better to have your support structure in place,  how can you possibly start and run a really good company if you don't have support at home?  That support is a loving family.  A child almost forces you to be in the second camp or give it all up.<p>Now, personally, what's interesting is that when I was 23 or 24ish it seemed like there was this spectrum of success that went from Bill Gates style billionaire down to being some hired contractor that did coding jobs to pay the bills.   Ultimate success would have been to grind out a decent company, sell it for a billion dollars, take some time off to do stuff that ""mattered"" (even though I was probably too selfish to really do it) and then try to do it again.    Now, building something sustainable that I love is the goal,  something that allows some balance,  something that would be really hard to just walk away from for a pay day.  Something that allows my co-workers and employees to live satisfying lives, start families, and have some balance too.  Oddly, that goal seems much better to me and I think it is radically easier to achieve.<p>That is of course after that first rough year to 2 years....

1839445,comment,1839022,1839022,0,0,mrpsbrk,,,"Hi. I am a designer that is trying without too much zeal to learn to program. Here go some advice, no idea whether it helps.<p>First, i believe that ""looking great"" and ""being good user experience"" are actually very, very different things. Designers are good just at the first. The second remains a dark art for programmer and designer alike.<p>For example, thinking about which user input you need or could do without, which order to ask for them and so on, falls i believe neither there nor here. Which effect you should apply to the input box is utterly immaterial, and i would venture that a competent designer can make any kind of use-process beautiful to look at.<p>As for making beautiful, i have found no way to develop this except by endless boring practice. The best illustrator is generally the one who has done more illustrations. Rules or techniques (as in crutches) tend to give good results in the very short term and become stifling very quickly.<p>If you lack the stamina or interest to simply draw, i guess this is not a bad thing. The other way to see the thing is that you'll eventually get better at it.<p>That said, designers do tend to develop a variety of manias and sensibilities that, well, <i>seem to be related</i>, vaguely, to their craft. If you're willing to try to get that, i would recommend a very, very old book. I know this goes directly against what you were looking for, but, again, that is my opinion: Symbols and Signs, by Adrian Frutiger. (Amazon has it, not sure if it is bad form to put an amazon link here... Also, i do only know the Brazilian edition so i can give no advice about that...). Maybe this book can come out sounding like full of rules, but that is not the point.<p>Another, more recent book that is also incredible, but even more paranoid (the guy goes pages and pages discussing commas, then semi commas, then colons, and i just love it!) is The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst.<p>Finally, designers always do end up getting a bit of cognitive psychology, and it is a good thing, but no self-respecting psychologist could purport to understand the human cognitive system, so i would say avoid the ones who are too sure of themselves like how-to guides to Gestalt, those are just gimmics. Find something that is serious about cognitive science, but not serious enough that you'll sleep, and that is it. You can always go back for more...",1288198895

The creator of the language himself has admitted multiple times that it was never meant to be anything more than quick glue to add tiny dynamic content to a webpage, much like Perl was back in the day. He rarely adds anything to the language because he thinks PHP will be better for it, rather he described it as whatever features people yelled that they wanted more. As such it's turned into this mess of a language today that makes you want to cry whenever you have to work on it for anything beyond simple websites.<p>OOP was clearly just an afterthought and is very poorly implemented / missing many core functions of real OOP languages.<p>No threading support. In fact, the language itself isn't thread-safe to begin with.<p>Libraries are close to non-existent for anything outside of basic web features.<p>Function, method, constant, and argument naming conventions and ordering are completely inconsistent across the entire language. Because of this for everything related to say, strings, you're forced to always re-lookup the damn argument order because the language designers can never seem to decide whether needle or haystack should come first.<p>The language has always taken years to get features that other languages took for granted a decade ago (like closures and namespaces).<p>For years it had terrible defaults and practically encouraged insecure websites. Magic quotes anyone?<p>I could go on a several hour tirade of why PHP is bad, but I'll just stop here. If you're still using it, I'm sorry.",1291042311

Beyond that it's useful for doing image rotation in a cross-platform way and for manipulating bitmaps.

And it's not just startups who need custom software—many small businesses need it as well, and they rarely give up big chunks of equity to hire a CTO.<p>Two major factors will affect how well outsourcing works for most people:<p>1) The quality of your programmer. It's an old cliché that the productivity of programmers varies by a factor of 10. You also need to take into account how good their code is, whether they write unit tests, what languages and platforms they use, and whether they're reliable business partners. If you're using open source tools, there's a shortcut to finding somebody good: Track down the project maintainers, and see if any of them run consulting businesses.<p>2) How well you understand your business. Some business people have a good grasp of what they need, and it's very easy for a good programmer to help them succeed. But my <i>least</i> favorite clients were always the ones who didn't understand their markets, who had dysfunctional committees, or who otherwise made it impossible for a programmer to earn them money.<p>If you have $10K to spend and a good grasp of what you need, you <i>absolutely</i> can succeed by hiring a good hacker. (Assuming, of course, what you need is genuinely in the $10K range.) On the other hand, I've seen small businesses spend the better part of $1 million on a simple database application and still crash and burn.<p>And finally, ask yourself what happens if don't <i>quite</i> achieve product / market fit, and you end up needing to pivot twice before you get traction. Nobody's going to lose <i>too</i> much sleep over a lousy code base if your business is successful. But can you afford two more iterations at $10K a pop?",1291040200

I suppose it's just because it lends itself readily to quantization and photography.<p>Other actions are far more dangerous than driving fast. Failure to signal is pretty much a pandemic around here, and when people do signal, it's only <i>after</i> they've already slowed, just before the turn (clue: turn signal is supposed to be a warning that I'm about to slow down).<p>Less frequent, but also very dangerous, is incorrectly turning onto a multi-lane road (for right turns, rightmost lane turns into rightmost lane; next lane turns into next lane, etc. For left turns, leftmost lane turns into leftmost lane, etc.) In my experience no one observes this, and very few people seem even aware -- but the consequence (that I've witnessed enough times, and even experienced) is to force other cars right off the road, or worse, toward incoming traffic.<p>And, of course, bad lane discipline (failure to keep right, a/k/a/ ""left lane dick"") isn't a direct danger, but impedes the flow of traffic, and results in <i>other</i> people doing stupid things.<p>I don't believe that speed enforcement yields much safety improvement; it's just easier and delivers revenues to the authorities.

And a 2x increase is pretty much science fiction anyway.<p>The lab structure has changed dramatically in the past 50 years: your average research lab is way bigger than it ever used to be and it's mainly composed of students and postdocs. The principal investigator would invest all of their time on a) writing grants proposal to get funded b) hire and coordinate lab members c) writing papers when it's time to.<p>This leads to the following problems:
a) it's difficult to identify intellectual contribution. Many times the postdocs and students are the ones who did the whole work, starting from having the initial idea to writing the paper. The PI may or may not help and at the end of the day will always get full credit.<p>b) PI who are successful by this standard will keep in getting money to hire more/new people.<p>c) with labs this size, there is no way everybody will get a job past the postdoc phase. In fact, only 1 in 10 postdocs can get a professorship nowadays, simply because there's too much demand and too little offer.<p>This means that a lot of smart people simply will not be able to continue with their career and, as a corollary, that a lot of not-deserving PIs will still be able to thrive exploiting their students and postdocs.

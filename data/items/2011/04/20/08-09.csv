So that allows it to occupy it's rather substantial niche.<p>Paper books still have some interface advantages over ebooks (as several people have described in this thread) but they'll go away as people build proper, well designed ebook readers.<p>When that happens, all books will have going for them is nostalgia and a pleasant physical experience that can't be replicated digitally. I think a much more apt comparison is records, which don't provide a fundamentally different sonic experience, but do have nostalgia and physicality.<p>So I think a handful of book lovers will still have collections, and visit the bookstore down the street, but like record players, and unlike radios, I think the vast majority of the population won't have any.",1303289700

Obviously it'll differ from place to place, and climate to climate, but here the highest demand occurs in the early morning and the early evening. Both peaks are caused mostly by domestic consumption - hot water and food preparation being significant.<p>Now depending on the time of the year this may coincide with daylight, or night time. Either way solar performance at this time of day is poor.<p>Of course commercial use keeps demand up through the whole day, but during this time domestic use (including heating and cooling where required) is either minimal or sufficiently random to ""smooth"" the demand. There is also some use all through the night (lights being an obvious source, although more efficient lighting is becoming more common.)

Yes, formats come and go. But as long as there's a sizable catalog of content in a given format, it's going to be readable. We can still read WAV files, RTF files and AVI files from decades ago. In fact, most computers can read these formats without even downloading any special tools.<p>It's true that reading your VisiCalc spreadsheets off of an old tape backup is going to be a pain in the ass. But that was the freaking <i>dawn</i> of digital storage. Imagining that there is going to be the same upheaval in storage in the next 100 years as there was in the last 200 years is absurd. Things are stabilizing. Media are being abstracted away. Powerful catalogs of codecs and transcoders are being packaged up into easy-to-integrate services.<p>I think there's a reasonable chance that YouTube videos will be viewable on all computing devices <i>for the rest of time</i> without us having to do any transcoding.  Maybe Google will migrate to new formats like they're doing with WebM. Maybe Google will eventually sell YouTube off as a historical relic. Maybe they'll even shut it down and someone will suck out all the public video and store it somewhere else like they did with GeoCities.<p>But acting like YouTube is the same as some tape backup, or an LP... it's just not.

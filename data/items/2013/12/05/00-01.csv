Linux Mint is Linux. People who run it say &quot;I&#x27;m running linux.&quot;\n2. Linux Mint does not run steam. People who run it say &quot;Steam doesn&#x27;t work on Linux Mint&quot;.\n3.

He reluctantly revisited the study in detail because he saw striking parallels to the torture and humiliation in the Abu Ghraib prison under US occupation. While he&#x27;s at it he also reviews much other research into the psychology of authoritarianism, obedience, dehumanization and other facets of social psychology that add up to what may very reasonably be called Evil.<p>I might add that organizations like the CIA are well aware of these principles, and appears to have been working on ways of weaponizing them.\nIt is my opinion that they are using them to corrupt individuals and whole social environments when that suits their ends.

Though, I agree SO has saved a lot of time with a great source for common questions and best answers, great answers. But, I also have to say that for many developers, specially in their early days, it provides a lazy alternative to learning.<p>A lazy debugging practice is to find a question that generally has a subject line almost exactly the same as the error message and pick the first answer, without even trying to understand it. I see the difference personally when I worked on .Net/Java and when I was working on a applet for Gnome. The latter is not very popular and so I have to resort to documentation, IRC etc. I might spend more time initially but I end up reading the documentation, develop a better understanding and even create my own snippets which in turn save me time eventually. To summarize, SO saves time but one might tend to leech on to it instead of learning. I guess some metric of how many times a person revisits the same question might be a good indicator of this.<p>Not to mention how many times I have seen a comment like, is this homework; show me what you tried, instead of an answer.",1386203619

Arguably, a classic libertarian government is indeed authoritarian: state power is exercised pursuant to the policies of philosopher-kings who believe in a particular set of &quot;rights&quot; (private property, etc), not pursuant to the will of the people themselves (who may very well have different beliefs). Indeed, even as someone who isn&#x27;t a leftist, I have a hard time seeing much difference between classical libertarianism and divine monarchy.

Certainly you couldn&#x27;t tolerate that the software hung to a memory error 0.1% of the time? Hence if the product supports the feature, then it must always work, and thus memory must always be reserved for it. I don&#x27;t understand how it would really work otherwise.<p>The other end of the spectrum, the &quot;modern way&quot; even in high performance tasks, with reckless java object creation and jvm memory shuffling almost makes me sick. Then everybody&#x27;s tuning the garbage collectors to avoid constant full gc. It&#x27;s heuristics. Oracle makes drastic changes to the GC defaults between minor releases.<p>While there perhaps aren&#x27;t maybe many direct memory bugs in such code, the code does become very unpredictable.<p>Then to fix that it&#x27;s again going to preallocated static pools and primitives and self implemented cache cleaning and what else, and you&#x27;ve lost quite a lot of your java style.",1386202852
6851661,comment,6850051,6850968,2,0,rayiner,,,"You correctly recognize the key issue that &quot;basic rights&quot; are intrinsically a restriction on democracy. The question is: what counts as &quot;basic rights&quot;? In the U.S., we have a basic set of rights: those enumerated in the Constitution itself plus those that exist as a result of long historical practice plus those recognized by the Supreme Court based on a combination of the other two sources. In a Constitutional republic, rights aren&#x27;t static, but they&#x27;re slow to evolve.<p>Cyber-libertarianism, at least as espoused by many today, embraces a dramatically broader notion of rights. You don&#x27;t just have the classic rights of Englishmen (life, liberty, and property), but the right to privacy, the right to free and anonymous exchange of information, the right to tinker with your cell phone, the right to turn your apartment into a hotel, the right to transfer money freely and anonymously, etc. Cyber-libertarians tend to believe that government should be restrained from acting unless absolutely necessary, and almost never believe that government action is necessary when it comes to cyberspace. The more rights you recognize, and the broader those rights, the narrower the scope of democratic self determination.<p>This viewpoint is the diametric opposite of constitutional republicanism. Under that view, government, by the will of the majority, can act so long as it does not invade certain &quot;basic rights.&quot; Under cyber-libertarianism, the assumption is reversed. Government is barred from acting unless there is an immensely pressing justification.",1386202831

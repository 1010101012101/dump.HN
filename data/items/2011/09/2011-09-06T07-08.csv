It's 2011, and linux <i>still</i> doesn't offer a stable filesystem with snapshotting/versioning, CRCs, atomic operations, etc. Soon btrfs may be here, but it will be years before it's widespread enough for application developers to count on it, and the basic posix APIs won't make it easy to actually make use of these things.",1315295954

2964573,comment,2963783,2963783,2,0,jeffdavis,,,"""the machine must present a single address space which can be considered non-volatile""<p>That doesn't solve the problem, or it is at least an oversimplification. How do you ensure that you are only writing out valid states, and not some state that is temporarily invalid (i.e. in the middle of some operation)?<p>I'm sure there's an answer for that, but that seems like totally the wrong direction. That's what a DBMS is for, and/or a modern filesystem with DBMS-like features.<p>I think that DBMSs and the fancy features in new filesystems are underused by applications. Perhaps that could be improved through greater standardization of the way to access basic ACID guarantees. Or, perhaps OSes should have these things more built-in and the lower-level APIs that are tricky to get right should be more obscure.<p>In any case, an oversimplified notion of persistence does not improve matters. Virtual memory just seems like the wrong place to solve these problems. How do you do a ""rollback"" of some operation when it's a direct modification of the in-memory state? (Note that a rollback is not the same as going back in time -- a rollback surgically undoes a single operation without affecting concurrent operations). If nothing else, a program bug can do a lot more damage (sometimes subtle and not detected for a while) within its own address space than it can to data already held by a separate program (like a DBMS or the kernel's filesystem) with its own consistency guarantees.<p>I think one of the most common software engineering mistakes is to not understand the role of a DBMS in application development, or to drastically oversimplify it (usually leading to a bad reinvention of the DBMS). The reality is that most applications would be greatly simplified by using a full DBMS (typed data, etc.), and almost all applications would be greatly simplified by relying on ACID guarantees.",1315294919

If you click the Edit button and look on the Quick Fixes tab, youâ€™ll find a Rotate button. But clicking it rotates the selected photo (or photos)  counterclockwise only. If you guess that Rotate options are on the Edit menu, youâ€™d be wrong. Instead, you have to look on the Photos menu, which is where the Rotate Clockwise option appears.<p>In Windows Live Photo Gallery, just about every task and command is available from the ribbon. The design allows you to pick a tab and then scan its contents to see commands that apply to the task youâ€™re trying to accomplish. In iPhoto, you have to learn where each command lives.<p>A good example is the option to use the current photo as your desktop background. In Windows Live Photo Gallery youâ€™ll find a Set As Desktop button at the left of the Create tab, or you can right-click on a photo and choose Set Desktop Background. In iPhoto, that option isnâ€™t available on a right-click menu. Confusingly, itâ€™s not available from the menu that pops up when you click the Share button at the bottom of the window; you have to use the pull-down Share menu instead.""<p>> And if you're on new-enough hardware to have real multitouch (the past what, 4 years?), they've already seen the gestural approach because it's been pushed at them from every angle multiple times - rotate 2 fingers = rotate picture. And that works from the editing perspective, the single-picture, and the bunch-o-pictures list. Zero clicks!, since they seem so focused on clicks as a measure of UI design.<p>Using the multitouch gestures is not quite that obvious. I've used mac for a little over a year and I've never used any other gestures than the two-finger scrolling. Besides, clicking on a single button is just simpler than rotating your fingers (assuming you want to rotate the image 90 degrees).",1315294566

A stacktrace, however, will often give enough information. Simply start looking down the stack for the first function that is part of your code base. The function may or may not have a line number. This depends on if you've loaded the source as a file, or sent an individual function to the repl on its own. In the latter case the line number information is simply not available to the language.<p>Using the stack traces solves 90% of issues I encounter. If I need line numbers, I restart the REPL and make sure that information is present. It's rare indeed that a stacktrace doesn't help at all, although it happens. I also use print debugging frequently. The REPL makes this technique a lot more reasonable than it is in say, C.<p>What would you suggest to improve the debugging/error situation?<p>--<p>If I had to choose a single biggest weakness for clojure adoption, I would say the lack of good documentation and also standardized process that is often so important when working in larger teams. The core documentation is good for experience developers, but lacks examples that many others find useful. The books clojure books are good, and clojuredocs.org is a great idea that has yet to get enough traction to become the standard go to place for documentation.<p>That said, it is still a young language and the community is working hard at addressing these issues.",1315293920

And that was mostly just a result of <i>associating it</i> with the thought of 'need'. But our bodies are apparently made to not bother us needlessly - it's not the body that's bothering us.<p>When you fast, rather, you go through the whole range of <i>conditioned</i> responses YOU have created to food. But you don't fight them, instead you get to just kind of say 'yeah, that's an interesting thing I've created' and go on with what you're doing. But once you know they are just that, nothing is stopping you. It's a little bit like meditation, where when you notice a thought, you'll simply label it a thought, and its power goes away.<p>And since you 'know' you will take great care of your body, now and whenever you break the fast (and please do that, follow the instructions, and break it gently, like a part of fasting, rather than straight back to old habits - your pancreas & co will thank you...), there's no crisis thinking or anxiety to it. Rather you get to be alone with your body and your thoughts.<p>I like it, because it is actually sort of easier to focus when there's just my body doing its things, vs the body with a lot of food it's having to digest, and blood sugar levels going up and down all over the place.<p>You get to really want something else instead, rather than associating/replacing all sorts of wants with food, if that's what you've done before. It's like realizing those wants are yours and owning them as that, rather than being owned by them when you think it is 'needs'.<p>Eating regularly is just a routine - probably a good one if it is done right - but there's so much extra luggage, so much extra use, that we put on top.<p>We really have a lot more power than that.

Depressions are normal, anxiety is normal, fear is normal, neurosis is normal, everything is normal unless it actually renders you completely inoperable so that you become a danger to yourself or others.",1315292670

I hated them but when they are collapsed everything is looking clean and they just work like a drop-down-menu with icons.<p>Ribbons are a big mess but now I don't have to look at them all the time, clearing my mind and my screen.",1315292612

I'm not doing anything harmful (hence the exclusion of phishing) -- and I'm making money.<p>People value all sorts of ridiculous things like homeopathic ""remedies"", psychic readings, and bullshit seeds on Farmville, how are those any better than spamming or content farming? I'd argue that the first two, at least, are far worse.<p>For that matter, how is the threshold of ""acceptable value"" set so that we don't similarly condemn, Facebook or 37Signals or SEO firms, for doing work of much less value than say, drug discovery or computer security -- especially when these are all within reach of the same CS grads?<p>Do Google's adwords count as creating value? Because they're how it makes it's money, search -- which creates value -- is just used to bring people in. If that separation of value creation/profit is all right, then is it okay to make millions spamming and give it to an efficient charity (as below)? If not, why not?",1315292435

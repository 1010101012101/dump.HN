You offer forth some conjecture, give an example, refute it, and then don&#x27;t formally state your thoughts on the matter. It leaves us, as readers, nothing to respond to really...<p>Let me give you an example. I&#x27;m going to describe the same thing two ways.<p>a.)Bank robberies seem to be easy to stop today, with the multitude of security systems in place and general improved response time of law enforcement. For example, in the last decade multiple bank robberies were attempted and the overwhelming majority of them were foiled. It seems that no bank would be susceptible to a robbery, however robberies are as potent as ever. Check out these random sources I have relating to isolated cases of robberies [0][1]\n[0]-source\n[1]-source<p>b.) It&#x27;s surprising to see that bank robberies are so potent given the multitude of security systems in place, as well as the improved response time of law enforcement. It seems that banks wouldn&#x27;t be susceptible to robberies given the tools they have at hand, yet we have evidence of it happening regularly, I wonder why that is.<p>TLDR/In Short:  You&#x27;re offering us &#x27;conjecture&#x27;, that is; you&#x27;re giving us your interpretation of how easy you think false caption detection should be(for the average pleb like myself), but you&#x27;re failing to tell us why you have that opinion and then you exacerbate the situation by disagreeing with yourself.",1399611599

7719441,comment,7716447,7719086,1,0,fspeech,,,"Yes Google is a rather special case. It clearly has technological advantages and may have succeeded despite its clumsiness if Chinese regulations were different. However that does not explain how others failed, like EBay or Yahoo. I showed clearly ownership restriction wasn&#x27;t the reason. Local operational control was, in my opinion. I don&#x27;t even see how this could be controversial. Jack Ma is one of China&#x27;s richest man. So are the other Ma (of Tencent) and Li (of Baidu). Does anyone think hypothetical resounding successes of EBay/Google/Amazon etc could have similarly minted local billionaires? Why would the same incentives work in the US to create successful entrepreneurs but not in China?<p>Tactically it may be true that stricter ethics rules make things harder. But that didn&#x27;t stop businesses like Starbucks from succeeding eventually, because their business model can be transplanted.<p>Alibaba didn&#x27;t have success handed to it. Its initial B2B model was ho hum. It had to or did recreate itself, multiple times. Its Taobao was initially a loss leader with free listings. TMall was also not given a high chance of success. It had ferocious competitors. It created its own business models and executed well to ensure their success.",1399611374

It seems mister Gates <i>knew</i> a certain thing was impossible to do, so he didn&#x27;t try ... and lost million$ and market share when his competitor went and did it anyway.<p>Here&#x27;s the story:<p><i>This business of taking software written for the 8086 processor and porting it to the 80286 normally required completely rewriting the software by hand, often taking years of painstaking effort. It wasn’t just a matter of recompiling the software, of having a machine do the translation, because Microsoft staunchly maintained that there was no way to recompile 8086 code to run on an 80286. Bill Gates swore that such a recompile was impossible. But Drew Major of Superset didn’t know what Bill Gates knew, and so he figured out a way to recompile 8086 code to run on an 80286. What should have taken months or years of labor was finished in a week, and Novell had won the networking war. Six years and more than $100 million later, Microsoft finally admitted defeat.</i><p><a href=""http://www.cringely.com/2013/03/24/accidental-empires-chapter-14-counter-reformation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cringely.com/2013/03/24/accidental-empires-chapte...</a><p>Accidental Empires is a good book.",1399610750

7719381,comment,7718277,7719145,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"LNG is still a fossil fuel.  Its supply is inherently constrained.  Most estimates are that we&#x27;ll hit peak natural gas some time after peak oil and before peak coal -- somewhere in the mid-to-late 21st century.  Jean Laherrere (who&#x27;s also researched peak oil) suggests a 2030 date for peak NG.<p>One characteristic of gas that makes predictions more difficult than oil or coal is that wells tend to peak and fail <i>very</i> suddenly.  Which makes sense:  you&#x27;re extracting a gas, not a fluid, under pressure.  While oil can be extracted, effectively, by sucking harder, or by forcing water into wells (what Saudi Arabia&#x27;s been doing for years now), gas flows until it doesn&#x27;t.  Experience to date with fracked natural gas suggests that wells peak even faster, often within a year.<p>See for example:  <a href=""http://www.oilempire.us/naturalgas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oilempire.us/naturalgas.html</a><p><a href=""http://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Shale-Bust-North-America-Natural-Gas-Production-set-to-Seriously-Decline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Shale-Bust-North-Amer...</a><p>As for NG as an aviation fuel:  while it tends to perform well on a energy/weight basis, it&#x27;s not so hot on energy/volume, and presents more significant storage and handling challenges.  Where liquid fuels will stay in any reasonably contained tank, LNG needs either refrigeration or pressure to  be viable.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s <i>impossible</i> but I&#x27;d strongly suspect it&#x27;s much less practical than liquid fuels, so long as they&#x27;re available.<p>That Russian NG aircraft has been under development for four decades and still isn&#x27;t available.  I take <i>any</i> paper-engineering estimates with several tons of salt.  Of the touted benefit, carbon monoxide emissions reduction really isn&#x27;t an issue:  CO is a problem in confined environments such as garages and warehouses, in which commercial aircraft rarely operate.  In the open atmosphere, CO both dissipates and reacts fairly quickly (forming CO2).  Of itself it&#x27;s not a long-term persistent atmospheric pollutant.<p>Similarly, NOx and hydrocarbon emissions are results of incomplete combustion and principally represent problems in urban smog where you&#x27;ve got large numbers of vehicles operating in a constrained area.  They&#x27;re not a particular concern in the wide-open reaches most flights occupy most of the time.",1399609591

Program still compiles, runs and probably doesn&#x27;t do what I expect.<p>* In Python, if I leave an extra , at the end of a variable it creates a tuple ( x = a vs x = a, ). Program still compiles and runs but probably doesn&#x27;t do what I expect.<p>* In general think of the time you spent hours and days hunting a bug that ended up being a one character error like above.<p>In either case, it would be nice if compilers or linters should warn you...<p>But anyway, I don&#x27;t think as you were saying, {} are necessary a cause for more or less &quot;errors&quot;<p>But, { } are a source of visual noise. I think it clutters the screen and it provides an opportunity for strange syntax. When I scan code quickly I don&#x27;t match up parentheses, I look for nicely formatted and indented blocks of code first. Whitespace and indentation is best for that.<p>There shouldn&#x27;t be 100+ page style guides for how to format a language, it should have a one, best, clearest, default formatting and it should be used by everyone.

7719325,comment,7714400,7714400,3,0,dj-wonk,,,"I can appreciate the depth of research behind the article. The many-valued notions of logic are quite helpful. Here&#x27;s are two ways that I would distill the message for different audiences.<p>1. A computer science audience: Not all sentences have a computable boolean truth value. Here&#x27;s why. To find the truth value of the sentence &quot;This sentence is false.&quot;, you have to figure out the truth value of the following statement (call it X1): &quot;Whether or not this sentence is false depends on if X1 is true or false.&quot; Put that way, you can immediately see the circularity in computation. From a computer science perspective, there is no terminating condition. The function will never complete, so there is no computable boolean truth value.<p>2. To an educated, but non-technical, audience: Just because a sentence asserts something doesn&#x27;t mean there is any guarantee of the result being &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;falsehood&quot;. The truth value of this &quot;This sentence is false.&quot; is simply &quot;undecidable&quot; or &quot;ineffable&quot; -- pick a word. So, just live with the fact that not everything is true or false. Note: I&#x27;m <i>not</i> saying that the statement is really one or the other but we just can&#x27;t figure out which (as in Schrödinger&#x27;s cat); I&#x27;m saying that neither &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; makes any sense for that kind of self-referential sentence.<p>This really isn&#x27;t mind-blowing. Many articles write up these &quot;paradoxes&quot; as if they are insurmountable. They aren&#x27;t.<p>All of this said, I think many philosophical writings, especially Buddhist writings, use contradiction as way of promoting thinking and careful decomposition of the essence of things. In short, complex things consist of parts that vary over time. So their components or transient values can seem to change or stand in contradiction.<p>There is no contradiction in Dickens writing &quot;It was the best of times and it was the worst of times.&quot; in my opinion. This is just a literary device to show contrast eloquently, because saying &quot;In some regards, it was the best of times. In other regards, it was the worst of times.&quot; is not as memorable or striking.",1399608757

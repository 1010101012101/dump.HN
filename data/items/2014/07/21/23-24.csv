It&#x27;s quite easy to hunt down the cruddy SQL queries in a DB, or realize that you spinning rust is too slow. But when it starts to come down to things like a blocking network fabric, which has some big fat buffer between two servers, that is killing your transaction speed - many will just start to blame the devs.<p>Of course, the second point is compounded by the first - the less systems thinking that went into the design in the first place, the harder it is to produce accurate hypotheses about the system in order to troubleshoot.<p>Whilst there is a lot to be said for the &quot;right tool for the job&quot;, if you watch an artisan crafting something, you&#x27;ll realize that despite having a huge number of tools, they actually get by with relatively few.

8066703,comment,8065403,8066594,4,0,mdisraeli,,,"And as mentioned in the opening to my post above, there was a huge roleplaying community on some shards (servers), who would use the static NPC towns as bases for huge roleplaying communities. One of the most notable features of UO, and one that few other games have ever replicated (I&#x27;ll come back to this...) was that you could drop anything onto the floor. So people would set up player markets in these towns, placing tables and laying out their wares. Players would roleplay guards, and then deal with any thefts, and sometimes players from another faction would raid and make off with a trader&#x27;s daughter (another player on an alt character).<p>In the PvP areas you could effectively run a toll bridge by laying out a road block, and fight those who tried to just push past.<p>A major difference with later MMOs was that (originally) when you died, your possessions stayed on your corpse. You would have to wander off as a ghost to get resurrected, then somehow get back to your body to get your kit back - a tall order in the middle of a dungeon!<p>Without any form of global chat, the best you could manage was party / guild chat, but often this wasn&#x27;t enough to get the help you needed. It became commonplace amongst the community to build a metagame community - you might not be in the same guild in game, but you were friends in the forum or in real life, or perhaps you met eachother in game and wanted a means to stay in touch. This posed a problem - no player-to-player system was really in place, and generally minor roleplaying was common - exchanging email addresses felt wrong and out of character. Thus the &quot;pigeon number&quot; was born - ICQ was the staple communication tool. When gAIM, the open source AOL/ICQ messenger (and others), renamed to pidgin, I can&#x27;t help but think this was deliberate.... ;)<p>The huge downside to these interesting mechanics and heavy freedom was the opportunity to grief. Kill someone, loot their stuff, ransom it back. Let monsters kill someone, loot their stuff, ransom it back. Tell a ghost you&#x27;ll only resurrect at their corpse and... you get the idea ;) I always was a big fan of some of the griefer stories, even if I didn&#x27;t agree with their ethics - Belan being a prime example <a href=""http://www.askcorran.com/belan/episodes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.askcorran.com/belan/episodes.html</a><p>Ultima Online was classless - you developed skills through their use. This also lead to some of us who roleplayed beggars trying to build the ultimate in useless characters - every single skill point up to the cap spent on skills that offered in total no benefit in terms of gameplay mechanic. Begging in UO was a real artform, and there was so much fun to be had roleplaying a widow and seeing what people would offer you.<p>And finally, these mechanics that few other MMOs have ever implemented? Ultima Online inspired two UK students to build their own version, which became Runescape. Runescape inspired Wurm Online. And one of the Wurm developers, was Notch of Minecraft fame. For all UO&#x27;s faults, it is truly an important piece of gaming history",1405986500

8066669,comment,8066168,8066320,14,0,cmeiklejohn,,,"Full disclosure: I’m a current employee of Basho Technologies.<p>Other than some supporting work [1] [2] introduced into 2.0 to provide advanced causality tracking, you’re correct in assuming we could have introduced more [3] CRDTs as part of the Riak 1.x series.  We could have also implemented all of the CRDTs we provide in the client as well, which is similar to what the SwiftCloud CRDT reference platform does.<p>There&#x27;s a couple important things to note here, however:<p>* When talking about merging conflicting writes, we are specifically referring to state-based CRDTs, not operation-based, which is what we have implemented in Riak.<p>* Retrieving conflicting writes from the client, or siblings as we call them in Riak, requires bringing all of the siblings to the client, performing the merge operation, and shipping the updated state back.  Given this, the number of siblings an object can have on disk, assuming all merge operations happen at the client, is potentially unbounded if you never ever read, and only ever write.  When implemented on the server, we can ensure that we perform this merge operation during both the read and write cycle, keeping the sibling count down to one and reducing the amount of state we need to ship to the client.<p>* In addition, we use the coordinating node (really, a combination of virtual node and partition index) of the write as the &quot;participant&quot; or &quot;actor&quot; for the operation.  This is not to be confused with actor model based languages.  This allows us to have better control over actor growth; when dealing with clients all writing to CRDTs, every single particpant needs to have a unique actor id.  Recall, that most of the CRDTs track actor counts, for instance the G-Counter which is structurally equivalent to a vector clock, although semantically different.  This introduces a problem of garbage collection.  Interval tree clocks, is one such solution for addressing the problem, but can not be used as the basis for some CRDTs. [4]<p>* Finally, there is work underway in making state-based CRDTs more efficient through &quot;delta-CRDTs&quot; [5], which allow for a more efficient optimistic and anti-entropy repair mechanism.<p>While the most notable resource for exploring CRDTs continues to be the comprehensive report by Shapiro, et al, [6] in practice many of the data structures outlined here have unbounded growth in garbage (specifically referring to items such as the OR set, which tracks an object for every operation performed).  Therefore, we rely on some of the more optimized representations which don’t accumulate garbage. [7]  In addition, the conflict-free, composable, replicated map structure, which is provided by Riak 2.0 was specifically invented by Basho, and it is the first of its kind. [8]  It took many hours and iterations on QuickCheck models to ensure that, given somewhat arbitrary composition, that merge operations happened correctly.  This is why there has been interest in exploring alternative ways of checking or building these models. [9]<p>By storing these CRDTs at the server-side, we also are able to provide a operation-based interface for interacting with these objects from all of our clients, and leave the complexity of implementing the CRDTs out of the client.  This additionally allows for our search offering, Yokozuna, to be able to index these data types and provide query over their values.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/746"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/746</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/basho/riak_core/pull/463"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/basho/riak_core/pull/463</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://basho.com/counters-in-riak-1-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://basho.com/counters-in-riak-1-4/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/itc2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/itc2008.pdf</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://twitter.com/xmal/status/467331615535149059"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/xmal/status/467331615535149059</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3368"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3368</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2596633"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2596633</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4291"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4291</a><p>* Edited to fix citation formatting.",1405985952

8066595,comment,8064947,8066490,2,0,mseebach,,,"So, I haven&#x27;t done any market research, but the model I have in mind is that the network is dark fiber terminating in a carrier neutral facility to decouple the infrastructure from the service - I think this is important for financing reasons. Running fiber to the home is a pretty expensive operation and most people would need some kind of financing. In a non-decoupled scenario, that financing would come from locking in a long term provider subsidy contract, but the timescales needed (maybe 5-15 years) are way too long to commit to a single service provider. They might be awesome in the beginning, but they then deteriorate or go bankrupt or whatever and you&#x27;re stuck paying for Comcast-like service for a decade.<p>A dark fiber, however, is a perfectly neutral medium and it&#x27;s trivial to measure it&#x27;s quality so you can set up meaningful SLAs (basically, like water or electricity - it&#x27;s either there or not, and if it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s the providers problem. OK, not quite, but it&#x27;s a heck lot more clean cut than deciding whether your internet connection is too slow, why and whose responsible).<p>So you essentially take out a mortgage on your fraction of the dark fiber coop (my consultancy could conceivably facilitate this financing - maybe there&#x27;s some local businesses or wealthy citizens that you like to underwrite the loans, but they&#x27;d still need the infrastructure to facilitate the loans and secure the collateral). You own the bit of infrastructure that only serves your house outright (if you&#x27;re in a dense area, that&#x27;t not much, if you have a two mile driveway, it&#x27;s more) and 1/nth of the shared infrastructure, including the carrier neutral termination room. When someone buys in later, they pay for any direct cost of connecting them, and their 1/nth is distributed evenly between the existing members. If this is a community effort, you can save a lot of money digging ditches yourself (the consultancy will provide instructions on how to properly secure the cables in the ditch) and by placing the termination room in a town hall, community center, church or local business annex - ideally close to existing backbone cable runs. Obviously, bullet proof leases and contracts for access to this room would need to be in place, that&#x27;s part of what I imagine the consultancy would help with.<p>Once you have the infrastructure in place, you need to get a provider to set up shop in the termination room. It would make a lot of sense for the consultancy to also be an ISP for this purpose. Maybe the cost of setting up could be incorporated in the initial capital of the coop, maybe the ISP will front it on back of signing maybe 1-2 year contracts for service (which is separate from and on top of the cost of the fiber), maybe it can just provide the service on the expectation of being able to do business - that would likely depend on how remote the community it. Installing optical transceivers at each end of the fiber is the responsibility of the customer and their desired ISP.",1405984985

Both of us are old Europa players, and used to have a house near the Fyde&#x27;s and Barian! And the housemate was involved in the Trinsic RP scene. Feel free to drop me a line if you remember us ;)<p>In a strange way, the community that formed around Ultima Online saved my life in more ways than one.<p>As a hacker, there&#x27;s a lot we can learn from UO&#x27;s ups and downs, and especially how much emergent gameplay appeared, and how the developers reacted. Clean Up Britannia being a great case in point, along with Trammel.<p>And from a pure tech point of view... what the hell was with the low latency of the old 2D client? For some reason it always offered a better connection than any of the multiple attempts to re-write it. That in turn resulted in the community sticking to said 2D client, and the developers cancelling the first &#x27;3D&#x27; client (still fixed isometric, just 3D rendered). What&#x27;s fascinating is some of the directions it didn&#x27;t go in - back before the Kingdom Reborn client was developed, there apparently was a Warcraft 3 style engine under development.<p>When it comes to game design, Raph Koster is one of the people who literally wrote the (a) book on the subject, having started out in MUDs and then being hired for UO.

Gmail simply lacks the &quot;WOW!!!&quot; it had when I first signed up.<p>A few other issues that have had me looking for alternatives:<p>* False choices for new tech. If don&#x27;t say Yes to transitioning to something like Google Hangouts, they make it really easy for you to push the button that says yes to hangouts.<p>* Google Apps for Business is pretty expensive when I actually see how people use it. 9/10 it is just for them to have the Gmail interface with their own domain. A lot of people forget that Google Docs exists until they accidentally click the &quot;Open in Drive&quot; or whatever.<p>* Spam protection has degraded with time. I receive more junk mail now then ever before. I think part of the email is because of the next bullet<p>* Wrong emails happen very frequently. Probably 2-3 times a week for me I receive a wrong email from someone <i>thinking</i> they own my Gmail account. It has happened three times with Apple purchases alone. A custom domain would help mitigate this. These aren&#x27;t malicious. They have my last name, but a different first name, but we have the same initial so I can easily see how they mess it up. Also the majority of people still don&#x27;t realize the Gmail + sign trick or that periods don&#x27;t matter.<p>* Lack of features. You added tabs? Thanks, ummm, I guess. Thank you for putting that in the Promotions tab when before every semi-clever person already had a filter set to move things like that into their own &quot;Promotions&quot; tab. That&#x27;s the big innovation?<p>In other words, almost everytime I check ShowHN I&#x27;m hoping for a new Gmail.",1405984481

His argument doesn&#x27;t really refute any of my points. Knowing how the rasterizers work is never going to hurt you, quite the opposite. If you&#x27;re serious about computer graphics you&#x27;ll really want to have internalized both raytracing basics and rasterization basics. If I didn&#x27;t know how triangle meshes are fed into the GPU and processed until the &quot;final fully lit&shaded output pixel&quot; for any one of my 94 favourite games, I&#x27;d feel pretty uneasy. Rasterization will always be orders of magnitude faster by necessity: that means when raytracing can finally render ca. 2004 scene complexity (think GTA:SA -- hint, it still can&#x27;t even at quarter-res), rasterization can render ca. 2016 (or 2018 or whenever) scene complexity at full-res. Guess what the folks at Rockstar, Ubisoft, Crytek wanna do? Throw more details, more content variation, more procedurally-generated or -perturbed geometry at the screen at 60+ FPS. Sure Brigade can reach almost/barely 30FPS at some low resolution in a small limited preprocessed scene and then there&#x27;s no more room for any physics, any AI, any animated crowds etc etc at all. They&#x27;re doing important work and one day the big payoff will come, but for the next 10 years knowing how our rasterizers works will not be wasted at all.",1405984033

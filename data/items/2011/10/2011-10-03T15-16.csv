3066756,comment,3064664,3065312,1,0,EGreg,,,"I thought this way for a while too, although not about everything. Actually some things can be really fake while others are actually simply thoughtful! It's the way you are taught to think about it.<p>Let me give you a small example. You know about etiquette right? In every country it's different. Are you manipulating people because you behave differently at Church/Synagogue/etc. and in a bar, or with your parents, or at a dinner table? Are you manipulating people by trying to learn their language and making sure you talk about what's important to THEM an not just whats important to you? I am sure that put this way, you think it's actually all good things. Yet, once we start going further and looking at it more mechanically, it starts to seem disgusting to you and to many people. Perhaps it has to do with the Uncanny Valley actually. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley</a><p>Here is the thing. You want people to not be systematic and strategic to a large extent when meeting other people, except where everyone in society is already being shamed into doing it. Why? I think it is because when someone becomes systematic and strategic, then any particular interaction seems like it's just a pawn in a larger scheme, doesn't mean as much to the one being strategic, and for the most part this is unfortunately true. On the other hand, greater mastery over a domain lets you make better moves, and over time gives you more connections and more experience so that you can actually HELP people in ways you couldn't before. An experienced salesman can sell your pretty good product that you couldn't sell yourself, and you can rely on him to do so, even though you might think his sales tactics are ""scammy"" at first blush. A person who knows a lot of people after many years is able to connect you to the right people even though they have such a large network that you can't possibly imagine they have close relationships with most of them, yet they help you and you appreciate it. Winston Churchill made sure to remember the name and interests of each person he spoke to at dinners. Is he being manipulative and strategic? Maybe. But people loved him.<p>I think the bottom line here is this: forget the ""stigma"" that society forces you to attach to actually putting thought and strategy into achieving things when it comes to meeting people, organizing things, etc. If you are producing a result that HELPS EVERYONE INVOLVED, then you are actually doing a good thing. The litmus test is, if you encountered someone who was a master at what you are trying to do, would you be HAPPY that they did this to you, or NOT happy?<p>I think most of it is about being aware of what the other person really needs and wants, and working to give it to them. For example when a nightclub promoter invites you (a guy) what he really would like is for you to bring a girl or two to the event, so more alcohol will be sold. If you don't, he may be glad you came but ultimately if you did, he would be way happier because you are helping him. You may say, ""well, you USED the girls to get more points with the promoter"". But you also USED the promoter to help the girls! They all get free drinks and a great time, and meet more people. And they also think you are a cool guy that they had a great time with that night. So everyone wants to see you again.<p>Look at the suggestion at the end of my post. Do you really consider it creepy that you take your friends' business cards, ask them who they are desperately looking to meet, and actually talk them up to people whenever you feel that you might make a good match? And then ask your friends to do the same once you have made some results for them? Is it weird that you have a group of guys who remember to meet girls for their friends and invite them all to a big house party so they can introduce their friends and generally hang out and have a good time? Is ""every man for himself"" the only non fake strategy? Or is it actually MORE fake? The guy has to generate all the social proof out of thin air, and at the end of the day, the first strategy attracts people far more, because a group of cool people who respect each other is more attractive. Why not be part of one.",1317657474

As programmers we are consistently straining our eyes.  I'm always in the doghouse with my optometrist because I am always breaking her rules.  She understands programmers and what they do to their bodies (fingers, wrists, eyes, posture), but obviously her bias is the eyes so she has a few rules that I should live by:<p>- don't strain the eyes reading small text.  Smartphones are especially bad at this.<p>- don't always look at the same distance.  It strains the muscles.  We were meant to look at short and far distances, but monitors are always 2-3 ft from our face.<p>- Take A LOT of eye breaks.  Every 10-15 minutes just look somewhere else.  That's all.<p>- Blink.  When people read screens, they blink less.  If you don't blink, your eyes don't lubricate themselevs and you can develop sores under your eyelids (especially so with contact lenses).<p>- Get more sleep.<p>- Wash around your eyes every night.  This is good advice for women as well as men.  If you mistreat your eyes, you can get protein build-up around the eyelids and follicles.  Make sure you gently clean all of it away with a warm compress.<p>Basically, treat your eyes like precious little jewels.  Pamper them and they'll last a long time.",1317657378

</code></pre>
In smartphones the display is the biggest consumer of battery.<p>For instance, I rarely use my Android smartphone, other than for making calls / reading emails (and I really don't do that frequently), and the display is usually eating up ~ 30% of my battery, even though I always keep my data connection + sync ON. And there's nothing that drains my battery faster than doing Internet browsing, with the stats on my Android showing the display taking more than 50% of battery life.  And if I'm outside, in the sun, browsing the web ; to make the screen readable I have to increase luminosity, and so my phone drops dead in 2-3 hours.<p>Another example - I also have an old Nokia 1100 - it's absolutely insane how the battery lasts for a whole week. If you can make your smartphone last for 6-7 days with whatever you want turned off, let me know ;)<p>I would also like an e-Ink smartphone, since it would be perfect for reading emails, in direct sunlight and also increase the battery life to more than 1 day - yeah, that would be awesome.",1317657315

The answer is no one sits down with sheet of paper and memorizes these sort of things. A person sits down and understands how to use a particular tool, and then later on he just looks up to some form of a reference. Over time this becomes just muscle memory.<p>This where tools like Perl/Awk/Sed and other Unix text processing tools win over Python. You have to spend some learning how to use them initially after which you get very productive with them. For most people who don't have exposure to how much one can push the combination of pipes and Unix text processing utilities its a little difficult to explain it in words. You have to just use it to feel how power full they are.<p>Often you can save days of effort writing lengthy programs and testing them. All you need to be is familiar with the Unix text processing utilities and know how sew them using pipes and you can amazing lot of work without writing any code at all.<p>Perl has a special distinction that it not only helps you do all this things seamlessly but also makes a great scripting language for any task imaginable today. You get one platform for quick scripts plus application development of almost any kind.<p>They didn't call Perl the swiss army knife and duct tape of the internet just like that. I don't think any other programming language has come to adapting practical software realities as much as Perl has.<p>Every other programming language forces you think in one way or tries to force its paradigm you. On the other hand, Perl bends towards your paradigm. That to me is more than sufficient reason to use and go back to Perl again, because adaptability ensures survival on the longer run.<p>A painter is never happy when the brush dictates his art.

That's probably fine, if the solution is better automation and failure detection. But once you go into postmorteming a situation where you dropped a few requests to a minor service, the whole process turns into a pile of shit where the engineers and operations team are scared, management feels in control, and the product managers are left screwed because engineering and operations no longer take risks and everything takes forever.<p>Engineering management doesn't stop and look at the cost of what they're doing and when software takes forever to release, they don't look in the mirror for the blame.

You can't let your employee continue to act this way for multiple reasons. First, if this isn't/wasn't his normal work ethic, something has changed. You need to act like a leader and just ask him. If you really want him to be a founder, and he needs something that isn't asking for the world than give it to him! It sounds like you owe a lot of your projects current state to him. If he's worked like this all along, and you haven't said anything than that is your problem and you need to deal with it. A poor employee like that can bring a company down if you just like it sit and fester.<p>As far as he's the ""only one that knows the backend"", any programmer that's proficient in the language of your application can get in there and get to work. It may take a little bit of time to get used to your current programmers style and quirks, but it shouldn't be an issue.<p>It really boils down to the fact you need to sit him down and talk to him. Be up front and honest, voice your concerns. If there are troubles in his life, he'll let you know and you can work with him.

That code will be nearly equally fast in Haskell as in, say Python.<p>BTW.

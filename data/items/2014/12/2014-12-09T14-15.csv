To be fair to the other languages, I don&#x27;t think this is a huge issue in day-to-day development, but from my experience is was an enormous issue when I was trying to learn a new language and I actually had to think about the syntax I was writing.<p>My biggest suggestion though is not to do it in java and instead expand your horizons - if I plotted my strength of a developer against time on a graph there would be long flat sections interspersed with sharp upward inclines. Those inclines? For the most part, short periods of time when I started working on learning to program in a new language.",1418137192

8723060,comment,8722175,8722519,0,0,pierrebai,,,"This is the archetypal problem with benchmarks: not only are they hard to design, but people will incorrectly nit-pick the results.<p>You count the number of allocations, without looking at the big picture: this is a toy example. It provides the hard-coded input to the function. This results in the C version not having to allocate memory for the hard-coded literals and the function problably being inlined and optimized away and the strlen() calls being equally optimized away as the length of the strings are known at compile time.<p>In the real world, these would come from some input where they would need to be allocated on the heap, just like the C++ version does. It would use just as many allocations, except they will all be hand-rolled, hand-held, error-prone, with every bit of memory management explicit. C++ is superior in every measure here. Only in toy programs and hard-coded strings does C wins.<p>If the goal was to have as few allocations from hard-coded strings, then just write &quot;foo@bar&quot; and avoid the concatenation altogether. That is not the point of the example.<p>(Also, the newer C++ standard support std::string literals, FWIW.)",1418137135

8723045,comment,8721650,8721920,0,0,compbio,,,"> if the AIs that are supposed to do our jobs turn out to be very fallible as well?<p>To state that AIs can be foiled by a specifically crafted adversarial attack, does not mean the AI is very fallible. Under normal circumstances it still outperforms humans. But let&#x27;s say the error rate of a net is on average 3%, and an attack works only if it is crafted for a specific net (where the weights are known etc.). Like a team of humans is able to come up with better solutions than individual team members, so does an ensemble of nets (usually) outperform any of its individual members. For instance, the final model  generalizes better, because it uses information and predictions from all the nets. Foil one out of ten nets, and the other nine will cancel out the bad prediction with their votes.<p>In an automated future jobs will be taken up by AI. A security guard then becomes a supervisor: 100s of nets will try to detect disturbances in a mall, and when they find one, they notify the supervisor. A judgement call is then made by a human. This is currently happening with law expert systems. A judge will input the case and get a prediction for punishment. Then make a final adjustment to this punishment, looking at the context of the case. Such a system prevents racially based sentences (the AI will not care about race, but look at precedent), while still giving emotions, judgment and reasoning a final say.<p>> it seems that some problems are inherently prone to making mistakes. Can it be avoided at all?<p>Some problems are incomputable, like finding the shortest program to reproduce a larger string. In others, like lossy compression, mistakes may be made in representing lossless information, that humans are unable to spot. I think this is a very interesting, but difficult question to answer.<p>> who do we blame when an AI makes a &quot;mistake&quot; like that? The training set?<p>We blame the AI researcher that build the net :). And she will blame the training set :).",1418137018

Nothing we have now is even close to being able to perceive and think in the way that a human mind does. We won&#x27;t get there through incremental progress, better hardware or clever algorithms. The shift from &quot;applied statistics&quot; to &quot;Commander Data&quot; will be sudden and unexpected, as big or bigger than any technological change that in human history that I can think of. We couldn&#x27;t put a date on that shift any more than Henry Ford could predict the common adoption of driverless cars, if they were explained to him in 1908.<p>A current deep learning neural network cluster and &quot;Hard AI&quot; seem similar but they really bear no relation to each other.

There&#x27;s some truth to this, but for the majority of people the goalposts have never moved. They associate the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; with an artificial mind that functions in the same way that a human mind does, &quot;Hard AI&quot; in the tradition of Asimov and other science fiction writers. We&#x27;re as far away from that as we&#x27;ve ever been. It could happen in 2045 or 4045, or anywhere in between.

How do you behave? Are you doing anything to put them off? Is there a chance you secretly think that as a man you should be entitled to sex with a woman? Some men do think like that, and of course they are wrong, and it&#x27;s a terrible basis for a real relationship. There are also men who think it&#x27;s normal to behave like an asshole, a creep or a jerk. It is not, of course.<p>It is possible to improve yourself and become a better person.

The fact that 23% of ad views don&#x27;t convert just pushes down the price of an &quot;ad view&quot;, ie those fake views are priced in to your CPM rates already.  This does not effect your ad budget however.<p>People that get hurt aren&#x27;t the advertisers but the quality publishers who may be struggling to sell ads at higher CPM rates, justifying those with fewer fake ad views.

In Szegedy et al., they constructed invisibly perturbed images that resulted in the misclassification of previously correctly classified images. Here, the results of a search were images whose classification have little to no visual similarity to typical members of that class.<p>In a way this is interesting because it&#x27;s a sort of visualization of what the network views as important in discriminating between different objects. It&#x27;s also interesting as a display of how alien the learned model&#x27;s view of the world is.<p>Take optical illusions...optical illusions are remotely similar to this sort of exploit, although the sort of scene modeling we do is a lot more complex than recognition or decomposition. Anyways, illusions exploit cues that result in distorted recognition but not drastically so, unlike the case for these networks. My guess is that this is due to animal vision using a lot more high level cues -- cues that are also useful in a natural setting -- depending on things like size, color, shade, lines, context and so on. Visual systems are also a lot more proactive, filtering out things that don&#x27;t make sense, fudging color at the edges of vision, smoothing out shades and generally making inferences and deductions about what it should be seeing and how things are &quot;supposed&quot; to be. In fact, a good number of illusions exploit those aspects of vision.<p>In the case of these networks, the cues are incomprehensible, having no natural counterpart, so we see most of them as noise. But sometimes they make a kind of sense, as in the starfish, baseball and sunglasses examples. Based on the observations in the paper, I would guess only a handful activations strongly associated to each feature are responsible for each susceptibility.<p>With animal brains the distortions usually end up in a slightly transformed space, a different scaling or something. It&#x27;s useful to match a bit overzealously and get something like pareidolia but it also makes sense to have the conflations actually be like something you might run into. The ANNs have no such incentive.<p>Their paper also wonders about whether this is unique to discriminative classifiers. Would a generative classifier, with access to a proper distribution, be so susceptible? That&#x27;d be very interesting to see.<p>They also mention some real world consequences, some of which I disagree with. Neural Networks are good at interpolating between examples, so if your training has good coverage over what is to be expected then it&#x27;ll work very well. And in the era of big data this isn&#x27;t really a problem (that they don&#x27;t generalize as we do might explain some of why they have trouble with abstract images) so I&#x27;m skeptical an image search solution would be thrown off by textures.<p>There is, however, a better example of facial or speaker recognition. For example, you could train a network to distinguish between faces or voices and then evolve a pattern against it. This could then be used in such a way as to be randomly matched to an individual on a target database. Not good. Driverless cars are also mentioned but those are typically augmented beyond just vision. Personally, I&#x27;d add medical scans to the list of things to be careful with.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that some of the evolved images are inspired works of art. And a few of the images optimized (not evolved) with an L2 penalization are recognizable without the label and a few more where you can see why it gave the label it did.<p>Your offhanded dismissal was unwarranted IMO.",1418136539

The allocator never returns. There&#x27;s usually some kind of helper system watching for the failure, which can take a dump or at least a stack trace.<p>The theory is that any attempt at recovery is going to be a disaster; not well tested, and probably doomed in the face of memory pressure anyway. On 64 bit systems the memory ceiling is essentially infinite, but reaching the point where we start to swap is horrible and a pyrrhic victory at best, so instead let&#x27;s do a controlled crash and log enough information so we can analyze and fix the actual problem (which is a misunderstanding of load and resources, or maybe a bug or an attack where we&#x27;re trying to allocate twenty gazillion bytes).<p>That&#x27;s one philosophy. Another (which was prevalent on the Mac in the 80s, in user applications) is to have a reserve; you test the crap out of the code and give it enough memory in some kind of emergency mode to succeed at getting back to a normal state, or at least quitting in an orderly fashion (ditch dynamically loaded code, fonts, whatever) so that the user&#x27;s work isn&#x27;t totally lost.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for both designs, and of course these don&#x27;t cover the case when you&#x27;re writing library code that can be used by anyone, where reliably returning failure to the caller is important. Here you don&#x27;t have a choice other than to check and be robust.<p>So three, yes, three philosophies.",1418136153

Kaboom. Oops. You can use auto, or you can use {} to make a vector, but you can&#x27;t do both at the same time!

There was no way for new students who were still struggling with the concept of a loop to figure out what they were doing wrong, besides finding somebody who had already been through it.<p>This was a long time ago, and C++ has improved, especially in the error message department.

This allowed to adopt a lot of nifty features and become extremely powerful, but it also means that there are a ton of bizarre corner cases and inconsistencies to deal with.

To translate to faces: There may be clouds that look random to our human brain, but are detected as faces by nets.<p>It seems this is an adversarial attack, where you need access to the guts of the net (weights, layers).

However I think that Paris has a very low quality of life in most of the fields that are ignored in metrics:<p>- Apartment prices are usually measure by the room when doing comparisons. In Paris the room count is misleading: I&#x27;ve seen studios smaller than 15 m^2 and 1BR smaller than 25 m^2.<p>- Apartment quality is really really bad: creaky, cracked hardwood floors that haven&#x27;t been replaced since Haussmann, humidity and mold are the default.<p>- The weather is awful, it rains 40% of the days.<p>- This might sound surprising but the average food quality is abysmal: produce is expensive and tastes like nothing and the random brasserie is an expensive tourist trap.<p>- Some of the stereotypes about the Parisian being grumpy and pretending not to speak English have a grain of truth. [edit: this is going to get me downvoted to hell]<p>So if you are really planning to start a business in France, go to another city: e.g. Lille is a thriving city with a very rich cultural life, it&#x27;s 1h away from Paris by train (if you need to network you can commute) and doesn&#x27;t suffer from most of the above (except for the climate).",1418134995

Node.js (or any of its lightweight frameworks on top) is probably a little stronger than Rails in this regard.<p>This service-based approach is more difficult with Rails as the community hasn&#x27;t blessed any consistent conventions around doing it.

I used Visual Studio as C# IDE for 7 years, and...<p>* Autocomplete - the XCode way to do autocomplete drives me crazy. Why XCode hides what I&#x27;m typing with it&#x27;s guess? Regarding Visual Studio autocomplete: you start typing variable. The autocomplete narrows your choice. You press up arrow/down arrow, enter/tab, you&#x27;re there. And the choice is always relevant, instead of &quot;I&#x27;ll put just everything I can think of&quot; XCode autocomplete<p>* Quick open - which Visual Studio version you&#x27;re using? In VS 2013 you can press Ctrl+, and get essentially the same functionality as XCode. Type file name, symbol name, enter, the file is open.<p>* Syntax/Error/Warning - Visual Studio gives you extra help if something isn&#x27;t quite right. You typed &quot;Regex&quot; and there&#x27;s red squiggly line? Place the cursor there and press Ctrl+. What&#x27;s that? An option to include System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace automatically? Or you typed parameter name that doesn&#x27;t exists? XCode will curse you, Visual Studio will offer (via Ctrl+.) to make the method for you, and it will infer return value and type of parameters from your code. That&#x27;s great way to start writing class from scratch, and I miss it in XCode.<p>* Debugging - again, I can&#x27;t argue about C++ debugger, but C# debugger is actually much more powerful than XCode debugger. You can inspect variable values in tooltips, there&#x27;s powerful visualizers, there&#x27;s an option to pin tooltips with values so they&#x27;re always visible (even when the program stops, so you can see the last value while fixing the error) and last and not least - very, very powerful Immediate window, sort of REPL for C#. I hope LLDB will have something similar for Swift.<p>And there&#x27;s much more that Visual Studio provides. Code Lenses (only in Ultimate version, but still). Code Peek - XCode sorta have something similar in Assistant Editor, but not quite. Find References. Call Hierarchy. And that&#x27;s just the basic Visual Studio (now free) functionality.

Roughly,<p>Transaction : Database :: Process : OperatingSystem<p>The four transaction isolation levels, defined nearly fifty years ago, were an attempt at categorizing incomplete isolation.  Can you imagine launching an operating system process and saying &quot;It&#x27;s OK if my memory locations are changed by another process&quot;  Or &quot;Don&#x27;t let my memory locations be changed by another process, but it&#x27;s OK if another process prevents me from deleting a resource&quot;.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re asking of our non-serializable database transactions.<p>Why not just provide strong isolation?  Partly because it is hard and partly because the performance impact of strong transaction isolation is greater than the performance impact of process context switching.<p>But if you&#x27;re living with less than strong transaction isolation, then tautologically, strange and unexpected things eventually happen: seeing state that never existed, seeing state changes that you didn&#x27;t make, failing to see state that you should have seen.

That latter point is becoming more relevant as we increasingly see computers deeply integrated into expensive devices with long service lifetimes. Just wait until a car manufacturer pushes out one of those combined “security fixes and new terms of service / we collect your personal data” patches and you&#x27;re faced with living with problems, suing, or clicking Accept and hoping you&#x27;ll have better options in a few years when you&#x27;re looking for a new car.<p>> Also, good filtering isn&#x27;t based on an IP address alone but that&#x27;s splitting hairs.

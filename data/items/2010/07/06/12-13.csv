1490814,comment,1490365,1490365,0,0,netmau5,,,"Cool idea, I've always wished there was something like this when shopping in a category.  My process always breaks down into cross-referencing several items on cnet, amazon, ign, etc and a vote would give me a quick top 3 to narrow down my choices and save me some time.<p>Feedback:<p>1) Is there a way to cross-post an item to multiple lists?  There are many categories that are simply subsets of others, ie HP Pavilion 1234 might be in ""Computers"", ""Desktop Computers"", and ""Gaming Machines.""  It would be nice to collate votes and comments from many sources too.<p>2) I agree with AlexMuir on the color scheme, and you already have an alternate color available on the home page in the orange.  You've worked this color in on other pages but not on the homepage.  I'd suggest using an orange-scheme for the list links since those are something you'd probably want to draw attention to anyway.<p>3) On the comments page, I tried to click the up/down arrows before realizing they were just symbols of how a user voted instead of a vote itself.  To make it more clear, I'd suggest using a +1 or -1 icon there instead of a different colored arrow.<p>4) You may be able to fill in some blank lists and items by reading through Amazon metadata or the like.  It takes alot less inertia to upvote something than it does to enter a list or item, so I think that makes it more likely to get user involvement.",1278421098
1490813,comment,1490142,1490727,0,0,benno,,,"""I am simply arguing that the most important thing in a project is the quality of the developers, not the language they chose""<p>I agree with the first part, but I think the language choice is integral to just how good those good developers can be.<p>I don't believe for a minute that a great developer can develop in PHP without being seriously crippled by it.<p>Functional programming has a tremendous amount of value outside of async/multi-threaded environments that cannot simply be replaced by other means. There are real limits to the amount of modularity one can achieve without functional programming, and modularity is key to great programming. I'd point you again to this paper: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1482797"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1482797</a><p>The state and history of the software industry at large only demonstrates that the majority of software developers in key technical positions within the industry are and have been less than great.<p>But if your argument is that PHP is ""good enough"" given a bunch of average developers... well then, yes, probably. Certainly plenty of good software has been written in PHP. I'd just argue that with the right developers it's far less than optimal, and that the choice of language could easily be the difference between the success and failure of a complex project.",1278421078

Profound stuff (general relativity, quantum mechanics, Poincare conjecture) is very often difficult to understand.<p>2. Continental philosophy is difficult to understand.<p>3. Hence, continental philosophy is profound stuff.<p>Frankly, applying the ""looks like a duck, talks like a duck, walks like a duck"" criteria, I feel it's more likely that continental philosophy doesn't qualify as a genuine area of human knowledge - it's all just nonsense.

Interest rates artificially low, lending based on political regulations, high ranking employees of major banks moving back and forth between government posts and high paying jobs at the major banks... nah, American currency/banks/Federal Reserve are incredibly government-managed and corrupt.

It's a testament to the will and work ethic of the Japanese people how fast they rebuilt the economy and started prospering.<p>That said, I'm 100% with the rest of your comment aside from the idea that the American money/currency is run hands-off, very good comment.

Is there an elevator pitch or value proposition?</i><p>I find Derrida to be a fascinating philosopher for several reasons.  One, his thought has a profoundly ethical component (influenced by Levinas).  Second, he questions many of the assumptions that other philosophers have taken for granted (in a way similar to Nietzsche).  Third, he has a very subtle phenomenology which I personally find very compelling (i.e., it seems to aid my understanding of the world.)<p>Of course, your mileage may vary.<p><i>However, if a pure scientist says to me, ""I can't explain it, but we're discovering something we think is interesting,"" I have more faith in her than a philosopher saying much the same thing, and I'm more happy for e.g. the government to fund her research and not the philosopher's. Is that wrong?</i><p>Obligatory joke-- College president, to the head of the physics department: <i>""Why do you need such a big budget for equipment?

Still, I bet Stephen King can actually throw a sentence together reasonably well, despite turgid prose and bad themes!<p>If you haven't read it, I'd also recommend the essay ""Politics and the English Language"" by George Orwell. You can even read it online for free: <a href=""http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm</a> (or for a couple of bucks at pretty much any second hand bookstore, as part of a collection of Orwell's essays!)<p>You have also called my bluff on history. I don't actually have a 'history degree', I have an Asian Studies degree with majors in Asian History & Indonesian. I shorten that to 'history degree' cos it gets more mainstream approval, and most computer people don't care less about the difference. It gets less negative responses than 'arts degree'.<p>So, most of the non-Southeast-Asian history study I've done has been historiography (theory of history writing.) A lot of which borders on the deconstructionist stuff that you posted the discussion of, today. So, given that you seem to be interested by that, I'll try and remember some good reads or at least ideas...<p>Max Weber's Ideal Type is an interesting idea, and an important one in the history of postmodernism's precursors. I also find it a useful conceptual tool to keep in mind when generalising or reasoning. I can't remember the name of the essay of his that I read, sorry, but there are a few linked from Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_type"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_type</a><p>I've only read a chapter of Foucalt's early work Discipline & Punish but I'd like to go back and read the rest. It's pretty heavy going though, from memory (translation from French doesn't help.) His ideas are really interesting and influential (at least the ones I can follow.)<p>Orientalism, by Edward Said. This is, from memory, another really dense book but it also has some really illuminating and rewarding sections in it.<p>The best ""real"" history book that I've read since uni is probably Howard Zinn's Peoples History of the United States. It's politically fairly extreme, and unashamedly biased. It's the unashamedly biased part that I really like about it, even though I don't always agree with the politics. I think it's both healthy and honest for an author to give up any pretext of being ""unbiased"" or ""objective"" and admit ""this is my theory, this is what I believe, here is my thesis laid out, make your own mind up."" Which is exactly what he does.<p>Homage to Catalonia, also by Orwell. Not really a history, but a personal account of a historical time.<p>History of Modern Indonesia, by Adrian Vickers.

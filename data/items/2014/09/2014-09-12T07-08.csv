The wide variety of options is one of the reasons Apple has a shot at getting people to adopt smart watches when everyone else has failed so far. It&#x27;s why they invited fashion industry people, and it&#x27;s why many of them loved it. A wearable is a fashion accessory first and foremost. When it comes to looks, people like options - we&#x27;ve seen this with the iPhone. People quickly got bored of black, then they got bored of white. Most people also accessorise with cases, not to protect their device, but for aesthetic reasons and individuality.<p>As for all the &#x27;Jobs wouldn&#x27;t have done that&#x27; BS, how do you know? There&#x27;s a reason Jobs told them not to do what he would do but to do their own thing. Not even Jobs new what he wanted. He changed his opinion regularly: no video iPods, then he released a video iPod. No bigger screen iPhone, then the iPhone 5.<p>This is one of those things that you look at and think you could do better but in reality dozens of the worlds smartest people have spent years researching and working on it and they have very good reasons for not doing the ideas you&#x27;ve come up with in 4 days.",1410508380
8306965,comment,8305938,8305938,67,0,ThePhysicist,,,"&quot;What we want from Apple isn&#x27;t new technology. We want human warmth â€” a possibility of living a more fulfilled, meaningful life.&quot;<p>I think this sums up nicely what&#x27;s wrong here: The belief that technology will make your life more fulfilled or meaningful. I didn&#x27;t watch the live keynote (I don&#x27;t have the required Apple gear) but saw excerpts on Youtube, and frankly, I find the level of religiousness surrounding this event appalling.  Maybe I&#x27;m just old-fashioned, but I really don&#x27;t like how emotionally charged most products are today, in the sense that they are supposed to not only solve a technological problem, but at the same time fulfill a social or even religious role and provide &quot;human warmth&quot;, as the author puts it. It&#x27;s not only Apple who does this (BMW comes to mind with their Mini commercials), but it seems they perfected this art to a point where their events have more resemblance to a Lenie Riefenstahl movie than a trade show (no comparison intended beyond the aesthetics of the presentation). And does technology actually live up to the promise? Studies show that, although we have more superficial interactions through technology, the number of close friends diminishes and more and more people become socially isolated. Take the metro / subway in any big, affluent city these days, and look around you. What do you see? People whose eyes are glued to their phone screens, oblivious to the persons around them, looking for &quot;human warmth&quot; in their virtual companion. That&#x27;s really not the society I want to live in.<p>Sorry for the rant, I just think that especially people who are very savvy and enthusiastic about technology and full of entrepreneurial spirit (like most readers of HN) are especially susceptible to this kind of religious admiration of technology and should sometimes take a step back to ask themselves what kind of society they&#x27;re actually creating with their actions.",1410508361

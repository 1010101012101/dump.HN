4261016,comment,4259897,4259897,5,0,callahad,,,"Hi Zaroth,<p>Thank you for the thoughtful post! I'm about to hop on a flight, so this is a bit hasty, but you raise a bunch of good points, and I wanted to thank you for the thoughtful post. I've forwarded this to the Mozilla dev-identity mailing list, and I think it will be helpful as we announce our Beta and polish the service and protocol.<p>For updates on a few specific points:<p>> <i>""Teaching users that its OK to type their credentials into popups is just crazy.""</i><p>We agree, and are working on adding native support to Firefox so that users only enter their credentials in the browser chrome, and never in page content. We're also working on a project that will authenticate Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo users via OpenID or OAuth, eliminating both the Persona password <i>and</i> the verification email.<p>Native support should land in Firefox 17 (off by default), and the provider bridge should go live in 4-6 weeks.<p>> <i>""The only way I could find to actually clear out my cached credentials from Persona.org was to go back into the Login dialog and click the This is not me button.""</i><p>You can also sign out by going to <a href=""https://login.persona.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://login.persona.org/</a> and clicking ""sign out,"" but that's not ideal either. Native support in the browser will make this much better. If I recall correctly, we did some user testing earlier this year and found that no matter which option we went with -- logging out everywhere or just logging out of the site at hand -- a very large percentage of users were confused.<p>Do you have any alternative ideas for approaching this?<p>> <i>""The Login dialog opened as if an email address should have been listed, but no email was present.""</i><p>What sort of connection were you on? If I recall correctly, we've seen similar issues when users are on slow connections / high packet loss connections. I've filed a bug to investigate: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues/2090"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues/2090</a><p>> <i>""Validation is complicated enough they dont want sites trying to do it themselves""</i><p>The data formats are still in flux while we wait for the IETF to finalize some specs, but if you don't mind keeping your validator up to date, you're totally welcome to do local validation. You can either reuse our validator (writtin in NodeJS), or use PyBrowserID which has experimental support for local validation.<p>This stuff will stabilize in mid-August when we formally anounce a ""Beta"" release and commit to API stability, etc. We're almost there! For the working group progress, see <a href=""http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/</a><p>> <i>""even if a domain does advertise support for BrowserID, that doesnt exclude certificates from being accepted that are generated by Persona.org.""</i><p>We're tracking that in Issue #1501: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues/1501"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/issues/1501</a><p>> <i>""Does BrowserID tell you if the user just recently reset their password? No.""</i><p>Brian Warner has implemented something like this, which invalidates all login.persona.org-backed sessions upon a password change. Pull Request #2026: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/pull/2026"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/browserid/pull/2026</a><p>> <i>""The fact is, when BrowserID says okay, you dont have any assurance the person on the other end even knows the users password. [...] requiring the website to abdicate all responsibility to a black box that just says okay, let foo in""</i><p>I strongly disagree with this characterization -- for the case of users with native IdP support, you're assured that the user agent successfully authenticated with the email provider within a window of time determined <i>by</i> that provider. For users of our fallback, this is <i>never</i> more than 24 hours, and in the case of public computers, is one hour by default.<p>That's a much stronger claim than you can make with a traditional password-based system, where a sniffed credential can be valid for months.",1342623518

We can't simply treat this specific problem as if it appeared yesterday, it has a history and evolution of its own. Certain methods have been tried, there have been many scandals, people revealed to be 'on the take', thousands of innocent bystanders have been slaughtered.

People don't use Oracle Linux because the Open Source community doesn't trust Oracle (and they shouldn't; that mistrust has been well-earned over a couple of decades).<p>There's a lot of reasons not to use Oracle Linux, most of them non-technical. Oracle is simply not an ethical member of the Open Source community, and if you trust them, they will screw you, some day, some way. Red Hat may have their flaws, but they've never sued over patents and they've never attempted to destroy competing projects or companies through legal threats and bullying. CentOS may be slow to jump on updates sometimes and to get out new releases, but at least it's a good Open Source citizen.<p>As an aside, if you want a faster moving RHEL rebuild that has paid developers working on it, you might try Scientific Linux. It is built by CERN and Fermilab, and tends to be very solid and fast to update and invisible (i.e., I don't think about it, at all, and it Just Works). We switched from CentOS to SL back when CentOS 6 was so late being released; couldn't be happier with it. We added support in Virtualmin for SL for just that reason...so many of our customers wanted 6, it was worth the effort to add a new OS.<p>So, yeah, Oracle is gonna have to have a ""come to Jesus"" moment if they want to participate in the Open Source community.

It's not as simple as it sounds though: if you land on, say, a $2 drink of which there are multiple such on the bill then you need a protocol to disambiguate. You could randomize again among the people who got one of those items.<p>What I like most about the method in the article is that you can avoid the confusing smaller items with high probability. Maybe the way to achieve that with your method is to walk down the items in decreasing order of price. That also forces you to identify sets of things that all cost the same, so you can do the second randomization if necessary.

And not to mention your 200 line SQL query does a lot more than you can do in 200 lines in any other language.<p>What I concluded was that we debug most languages line by line, like moving through a linked list.  SQL is much more efficient.  A query, if it is well structures (no inline views or UNIONs) is a small set of sections, each of which is broken down further.  So instead of reading through a query line by line, we figure out which section to look at, which relations are involved and debug that way.  It's like searching a btree instead.",1342621517

Let me elaborate on the MQ point.<p>We do want media queries and it isn't too complicated, indeed. Like you correctly pointed out, we have some amazing designers on Scoutzie and many of them are familiar with responsive layouts. We could design a layout that looks great. More so, we could upgrade to the latest version of the Bootstrap and use their responsiveness to accomplish this goal.<p>Having said that, we have been been changing something on the site on at least weekly basis, tweaking the layout, occasionally flipping it on its head. With that, I track analytics and I know the percentage of users that come from mobile and I can guesstimate their behavior on the site; it's very similar to the desktop users, not better, but not worse. So, maintaining a responsive layout right now just doesn't make as much sense for us, if you consider the time tradeoff.<p>Furthermore, a responsive layout shouldn't just be smacked on top of the regular design. If we were to create a truly great experience on mobile, we should design it with mobile needs in mind. Just having object be smaller and wrap around is a good start, but I believe there is more to responsive design than that.<p>For right now, we'd rather focus on making a better overall (desktop, for now) experience, and once we got it down, we'll go ahead and revamp the responsiveness.",1342620993

You have to show a lot of initiative though - it can't be conceptual in nature. For example, you wouldn't want to approach a rock star in your space and say ""I'm thinking of doing this, would that work?"" Instead, approach them and say ""Check this out, here's what I have done. What do you recommend I do next?"" If they get excited about what you have done, then you may have found a good match. Let that relationship grow and do not force them into being a mentor.

Likewise, people on Twitter who don't have a blog, probably just wouldn't publish anything at all in the absence of Twitter, so it's a net gain in that respect.<p>Finally, Twitter does have a corporate API, isn't most of it accessible through the open web any way?

It's very similar to Apache Ant and uses a XML file to describe the build tasks (include/exclude files, copy, tar, SCP, run PHPUnit tests, etc.) and can easily be extended using PHP (we use the rsync extension). It takes a little while to get everything up and running, but once you've got it (and well tests) it'd pretty much bulletproof.<p>Also worth taking a look at WePay's blog post on how they do deployments: <a href=""http://blog.wepay.com/2010/11/30/weploy-wepays-deployment-tool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wepay.com/2010/11/30/weploy-wepays-deployment-to...</a>",1342620634

4260767,comment,4260288,4260385,2,0,mdasen,,,"I have one possibility of what might be going on.<p>When you have multiple joins that aren't one-to-one mappings you get all of the different combinations in the result set.<p>Let's say that you have 5 people, each with 5 addresses and 5 phone numbers.  The result set wouldn't have 55 rows (5 people + 25 phones + 25 addresses), but 125 rows (a row for each combination).  The difference gets larger as the numbers get larger (for 100 addresses and phones per person, it's 1,005 vs. 50,000).  Your ORM also needs to figure out that semi-mess and when you get to large numbers of rows, that's a lot of rows to process.<p><pre><code>  John | Address 1 | Phone 1\n  John | Address 1 | Phone 2\n  John | Address 1 | Phone 3\n  John | Address 1 | Phone 4\n  John | Address 1 | Phone 5\n  John | Address 2 | Phone 1. . .\n</code></pre>\nSo, you're potentially pulling back a ton of excess data.  Phone 1 will appear 5 times in the result set and then the ORM has to de-duplicate that.  Likewise, Address 1 shows up 5 fimes in the result set and John shows up 5 times in the result set and the ORM needs to deal with it.  Likewise, it's a lot of excess data over the wire and a lot of excess data to even process into a hash.<p>Now, Hibernate has a way around this.  It's been a while, but it's something along the lines of setting it to fetch related entities in batches (EDIT: doing slight Googling, but not checking it in code, it's the @BatchSize annotation and @Fetch annotation that you'll want to look into).  In that case, Hibernate basically does a ""SELECT * FROM people"" and then a ""SELECT * FROM addresses WHERE person_id IN (list_of_people_ids_from_last_query)"" and a ""SELECT * FROM phones WHERE person_id IN(list)"".  That way, Hibernate gets 5 people records plus 25 address records plus 25 phone records (55 rows in total) and there aren't any duplicates that need to be weeded out, etc.  It's three queries which is more than 1, but a lot fewer than the looped queries without the cartesian product.<p>This is the behavior that Rails' Model.includes(:relation) and Django's Model.objects.prefetch_related('related_set') use.  There was a discussion (possibly years ago) on the django-developers list about why select_related('related_set') didn't work on reverse foreign keys and this is the reason why.",1342620618

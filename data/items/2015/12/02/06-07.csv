I can&#x27;t respond to most of the things in this thread, so don&#x27;t bother asking.)<p>&quot;If Google were to provide real transparency into the information they track about me, that would be fantastic.&quot;<p>&quot;In no way do I believe that is all the data Google tracks about me.&quot;<p>The second comment here is why there&#x27;s no point in doing the first one. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much information we release about this, when people are determined not to believe it.<p>It is a frustrating experience for the people who work on them to pour time and effort into making sure a privacy policy is really <i>precisely</i> accurate about what is happening, and then see threads like this where people will go looking for loopholes that aren&#x27;t there, and because English is fairly ambiguous they&#x27;ll eventually find a way to misinterpret the words to support what they wanted to believe all along.<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting hypothetical question: if the primary effect of the conspiracy theorists is to throw bricks at the people who are trying really hard to make sure the bad things never happen, then which side are the conspiracy theorists really on? (I make no claims about whether this is what&#x27;s happening, because I can offer no evidence, I just think it&#x27;s an interesting question)",1449039598

Wonder why you can&#x27;t buy everything Patagonia makes in black, like you can for anything North Face? This is why.<p>What? A black waterproof coat is dorky, it makes you look like a walking garbage bag. I should know, I have one (it was the only color left in my size). They are popular with people who have to wear them on the job, though, because they look &quot;professional&quot; (I don&#x27;t mean a cool, adventurous job like mountain helicopter rescue who can wear a red and orange coat, think instead of a security guard who has to patrol the same block all day in the rain.)<p>> Wondering why effectively everything they make with a hood has an oversized hood that fits a helmet instead of being geared to bay geeks that have to walk two blocks from their Uber in the rain? This is why.<p>First off, do you not understand how Uber works? Second, you think bay geeks don&#x27;t wear helmets when they go mountain biking or snowboarding? If anything, they need an even bigger hood to fit their GoPro.<p>You know, that Patagonia post, obvious brand marketing though it is, was actually working. &quot;Patagonia sure cares about the environment and making sturdy, quality goods like in the good old days&quot;, I thought. But now, thanks to your comment, my subconscious will instead remember that &quot;Patagonia are a bunch of sanctimonious jerks&quot;. Congratulations on ruining it!",1449039435

10661332,comment,10658316,10658316,0,0,gnarbarian,,,"Posting my comment I made about this game three years ago:<p>The UI in Dwarf Fortress is completely indefensible. Even when you do understand how to play the game it&#x27;s a kludge. Let alone the fact that AN ASCII GAME CAN BRING AN 8 CORE DESKTOP TO A CRAWL. (The ASCII is actually rendered in OPENGL for performance which is a joke in and of itself because 99% of the system resources are spent poorly simulating stagnant blocks of air rock and dirt with nothing happening to them).\nThere are many amazing and laudable aspects to DF. Tarn has a physics background and in this regard the game is well thought out. It has unmatched emergent gameplay and behavior due to the physics and complexity of each dwarf.\nWhat isn&#x27;t well thought out at all are both the &#x27;design&#x27; of the software and interface. This is the most beautifully complex game with endless unique and hilarious morsels of awesome (the naming of geographic features and depictions engraved on items) Yet absolutely no effort is spent on conveying that to the user. It&#x27;s like the game itself is autistic in its savant level complexity and all that beauty is hidden behind an utterly unusable interface and horribly inefficient software design.\nDwarf Fortress is a perverse decent into a single brilliant yet mal adjusted person&#x27;s &#x27;ideal&#x27; game. It&#x27;s wildly capable and meticulously tended to in all the wrong areas while the glaringly obvious flaws go unattended.\nIt&#x27;s like a brilliant mathematician who shits on the floor and writes earth-shattering proofs on discarded fast food bags leaving them strewn about homeless shelters. The hobos (DF fans) all rightfully commend his genius and defend the antisocial idiosyncratic behavior as &quot;part of the creative process&quot; or that anything else would detract from &#x27;the experience&#x27; of reading a revolutionary proof off of a shit stained McDonalds bag.\nThe main problem is Tarn&#x27;s inability to work with anyone else or compromise. The poor quality interface and software design is a perfect metaphor for the developer behind it. The smallest improvement such as rendering more ASCII layers at once from an isometric perspective would vastly improve the usability and likely expand the userbase by 10 fold yet no effort is made to make ANY UI adjustments.\nMinecraft is the perfect example of the level of success DF is capable of. Their premise is quite similar, but where Notch&#x27;s effort went into a simplistic usable UI with simple physics, Tarn went without a UI and devoted his effort to a bewilderingly complex and amazingly inefficent engine with no reasonable way for anyone to experience it. Tarn could be a multi millionare if he simply would take some damn advice about sofware and UI design.\nSeriously, With two more people helping him, one person focused on optimizing the codebase and another focused on improving the UI this would literally be one of the greatest games of all time.\nUntil that day DF will remain an obscure oddity, like a model train set with a revolutionary efficient engine whose owner steadfastly refuses anyone to use it in anything except a toy which actually causes physical pain to all who attempt to play with it.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5277033"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5277033</a>",1449037209

The incidence of SQLi has definitely decreased over the years but I would estimate that we still identify it on approximately 1 of every 5 web apps that we test for our clients. Usually, the more obvious SQLi has been found and patched already years ago. An example of obvious SQLi is &#x27;error based SQLi&#x27; where the application returns verbose error messages such as:<p><pre><code>  &quot;You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual\n  that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the\n  right syntax to use near &#x27;\&#x27;&#x27; at line 1&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAs soon as we see an error message like this, we know we can dump the entire database in a matter of minutes.<p>These days, we usually have to work a bit harder to find the more difficult to identify and exploit SQLi (e.g. boolean-based blind and time based) but the end result is the same once we do. SQLMap is a standard tool in a any good web app penetration tester&#x27;s toolkit. It&#x27;s not always going to work but when it does it automates away a lot of the grunt work. I applaud the SQLMap developers who seem to know SQL inside out and actively acknowledge feedback from the community.<p>For any devs, this is decent guide for preventing SQLi:<p><a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Che...</a>",1449036702

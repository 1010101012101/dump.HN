A lot of people, probably the majority of people in the America, have some amount of insecurity about where, or whether, they went to college. The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest liability of not having gone to the college you'd have liked is your own feeling that you're thereby lacking something. Colleges are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect. There is only one real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs: you know you wouldn't be missing much if you weren't. When you're excluded, you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider. But invariably they're larger in your imagination than in real life.""",1189010501

50514,comment,50456,50456,0,0,aston,,,"First, I'd just like to point out that PG is in an interesting place to report that college doesn't matter, having himself attended two Ivy League schools. <p>There are two arguments happening here. The first is that entrepreneurship and business success are not so well correlated with where you go to undergrad. The second is that where you go to college doesn't make much of a difference in life in general. I won't really quarrel with the first, since it's been demonstrated pretty often, and YC's results support it as well. The second, on the other hand...<p>The main problem with trying to assert that college doesn't make a difference in life is that there's really no easy measurement you can do over ""net change"" in life. That's due both to the long span of time a life consumes as well as the complex and/or fuzzy cause-effect relationships that are at play throughout. At best, I think, you would need to argue over objective differences that have some immediate effect, and then hope that those actually do make a difference. As an example, here are some of the things that I think made Paul Graham successful that are pretty strongly related to his going to graduate school at Harvard: <p>- he met RTM and Trevor there<p>- he got to spend his time in Boston, where he's acknowledged startups can thrive<p>- being able to drop the H-bomb almost certainly helped give credibility to his company<p>- he learned Lisp (not really the most popular language at the time, except at certain places)<p>Would Viaweb have happened had he gone elsewhere, or skipped grad school altogether? Well, maybe. But I doubt it. Harvard's name is what convened the talent (peers, advisors, mentors, investors) that shaped much of that company, and it's there that Harvard's value lies.

""If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a graduate school). This will give you access to some jobs that require credentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field, but if you don't enjoy school, you can (with some dedication) get similar experience on the job. In any case, book learning alone won't be enough. ""Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter"" says Eric Raymond, author of The New Hacker's Dictionary. One of the best programmers I ever hired had only a High School degree; he's produced a lot of great software, has his own news group, and made enough in stock options to buy his own nightclub.
# Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer on some projects; be the worst on some others. When you're the best, you get to test your abilities to lead a project, and to inspire others with your vision. When you're the worst, you learn what the masters do, and you learn what they don't like to do (because they make you do it for them)."" <p>He is referring to Jamie Zawinski.

50498,comment,50456,50456,0,0,cperciva,,,"I did my D.Phil. at Oxford University, and my B.Sc. at Simon Fraser University; while SFU is one of Canada's best universities, it clearly doesn't have the stature of Oxford or Harvard.  Were the students at Oxford more intelligent than the students at SFU?  No.  Were they more motivated?  No.  Are there jobs for which I'd rather hire an Oxford alumnus than an SFU alumnus?  Absolutely.<p>The largest advantage of a great university like Oxford is in increasing the range and depth of ideas presented to students.  It's impossible to completely separate the teaching role of a university from its research role: Teaching (and inconvenient questions asked by irritating students, like yours truly, in class) informs research, and research informs teaching.  And quite apart from the ""indigenous"" research, if you're at a minor university without a strong reputation for research, you don't have Knuth dropping by for a few months, or Rivest visiting to give a lecture (albeit about the rather odd notion of obtaining forward security by using a stream of broadcasted random numbers which is too fast to be stored).<p>There are undeniable advantages to being at a great university in being exposed to new ideas.

All I'm saying is if somebody with who didn't go to Horace Mann and Harvard or Yale and isn't related to somebody who may help behind the scenes came up with ""the next big thing"" ... NOW ... during THIS time period when China controls more of our economic destiny than silicon valley and wallstreet combined ... well then you should pay close attention to that person.  They're super-smart in a way that is directly relevant in cold, hard reality land.  But can you find such a person?  Who?  Thought so.  Everybody else just take with a few dozen grains of salt.  And people who know how to make it in tough environments will never show you how its done.  Why would they?  The number one rule in business is ""Figure it out for yourself.""  I'm sorry but there are no shortcuts, no magic formulas, and the sooner you realize that the better.  And people who tell you that they have some ""system"" for pumping out real-estate fortunes, or making a killing in the stock/commodity market, or pumping out multibillion dollar startups at-will (ecompanies, idealab, and the 300 or so ""incubators"" that got started 1998-2000) never made a penny in anything but getting people to sign up for their magical secret systems.  And making money at one time period during certain circumstances does not the expert make.  Honestly - who thinks mark cuban could start another company and sell it a year later for $5 Billion today?  How about 1 Billion?  I doubt he could convince anybody in today's market to give him a loan.  I'll say what is being left out.  More than likely you will not make it at YC or even Kleiner Perkins.  You will probably fail.  You might be inspired to come back again having learned much and made good contacts from the experience.  But nobody at YC will give you a loan and pay your apartment rent and car bills while you look for a job to pay the bills until you recover and get ready to try again.  And you need to be used to that reality because people who called will call less and less and then eventually they won't return your calls.  For years.  Until they hear you're up to something cool again.  If you can deal with that reality, fine.  Deal with it 1, 2, maybe 3 or 4 times.  If it sounds to cold, rethink how much time you're ready to commit.",1189008013

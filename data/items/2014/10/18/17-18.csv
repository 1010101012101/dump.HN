The point of these forums is to have intelligent discussion, which you can&#x27;t have without differing opinions.<p>Personally, I get really frustrated when I spend 20 minutes writing out what I think is a respectful, thoughtful response with links to all of my sources, only to watch it get downvoted into oblivion only because (as far as I can tell) I&#x27;m conveying a minority opinion.  It kills discussion and turns threads into echo chambers.<p>I turn on showdead and run my mouse over every grayed-out comment now.

8475859,comment,8474824,8474824,0,0,Animats,,,"The conventional wisdom is that it&#x27;s not possible to detect MITM attacks other than by using some trusted path to validate the credentials from the other end.  But that&#x27;s not quite true. When an attacker decrypts with one key and re-encrypts with another, the encrypted bit stream changes.  Both ends now have different encrypted bits.  If they can somehow compare them, a MITM attack can be detected.<p>One early secure telephone unit displayed a 2-digit number derived from the beginning crypto bits.  Users were supposed to confirm, by voice, that both units showed the same number. An attacker would have to break into the voice stream and\nsubstitute voice words in a matching voice to prevent that detection.<p>This illustrates what&#x27;s possible.  It&#x27;s possible to force a MITM attacker to do considerable work (perhaps an arbitrarily large amount of work) to prevent both ends from comparing notes on what crypto bits they have.  More than that, the endpoints can force the attacker to have to construct an arbitrarily complex lie in the form of impersonation of content.<p>David Chaum (of DigiCash fame) claims to have developed a way to detect MITM attacks along these lines.  See U.S. Patent Application #<i>20060218636.</i><p>The USPTO rejected the patent application, because of prior art\nfrom Microsoft (U.S. Patent # 7,475,421)  for &quot;Automatic Re-Authentication&quot;,\nwhich is about recovering disconnected Microsoft Terminal Server\nsessions securely and is limited to re-connection. So Chaum&#x27;s approach seems to be\nunencumbered by patents. However, his explanation is almost incomprehensible.\nThere&#x27;s a thesis that explains it, though.<p><a href=""http://www.cisa.umbc.edu/papers/theses/newton-thesis-2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cisa.umbc.edu/papers/theses/newton-thesis-2010.pd...</a><p>Even that is heavy going.  Here&#x27;s a simple explanation of the concept.<p>if both ends can compare some of their crypto bits, they can detect a naive MITM attack that&#x27;s decrypting and re-encrypting at the transport level.   A smarter MITM attack would detect and rewrite that exchange of info, even if it occurred at\na higher protocol level, like HTTP.  However, the effort required by the MITM attacker can be made very large, and the MITM attacker can be forced to introduce delay.<p>An example approach would be to send an HTML or XML document which contains an item showing the N crypto bits that both ends should be seeing.  Wrap the entire document with an item which has a cryptographic hash of the entire document, and send the hash BEFORE sending the document content.  If the attacker just sends the HTML/XML through unchanged, the attack will be detected. If they change the item containing the N crypto bits, the hash will be wrong and the attack will be detected.   If they generate a fake document with suitable crypto bits and hash, they have to do so before they&#x27;ve seen the entire content of the actual document. If they buffer up the entire document so they can modify the document, they introduce delay equal to the transmission time for the entire document.  It should be possible to detect that delay.<p>For concreteness, suppose the server does the SSL/TLS handshake, then sends the HTTP headers, which contain the cryptographic hash of the material to follow.  This is done as fast as possible. The server then sends most of the rest of the document. But at the end of the document, it pauses until 3 seconds have elapsed from receipt of the HTTP request before sending the last hundred bytes or so.  Most of the document will still render, although &quot;onload&quot; Javascript won&#x27;t trigger yet.<p>At the receiving end, the browser only allows the server 2 seconds from HTTP request to headers received.  If the server can&#x27;t keep up, the page will be treated as untrusted.<p>This provides considerable MITM protection.  An attacker must be able to fake page content to defeat this.",1413654971

I should point out that for those of you experimenting with deep learning, you&#x27;ll probably not be writing your own code from scratch. There are various open source libraries (pylearn2, torch, caffe, others) that make things <i>a lot</i> easier when you&#x27;re getting started. They still have something of a learning curve though.<p>I should caution also that not all of the libraries work as well with the latest or earliest GPUs, so the model of GPU you buy still makes a big difference.

8475785,comment,8473771,8474918,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> No. I interpreted the original assertion and subsequent discussion to be about the effect of prison on crime against the general public.<p>Even putting aside the implied exclusion of prisoners as members of the general public, it doesn&#x27;t actually work that way. Prison inmates can cause physical or psychological damage to other inmates who are about to be released, increasing the subsequent drain they put on public resources and their likelihood of re-offending. Inmates can be threatened with violence if they don&#x27;t convince their families or associates to commit crimes on the outside. Crime bosses can smuggle in cellphones and bribe prison guards to carry on running their organizations. &quot;What happens in prison stays in prison&quot; is the opposite of what happens in prison.<p>> My guess is that the crime rate against the general public as a function of prison time curve [1] is not monotonic. I expect that there is at least one local minimum before the absolute minimum reached at life imprisonment.<p>I agree that it probably isn&#x27;t monotonic, but it seems like asking the wrong question. If a specific type of punishment causes harm to the convict and causing harm to the convict increases the probability of recidivism then every ounce of that punishment you mete out is counterbalancing itself. Increasing the deterrent also increases the damage. Sure, the two curves may not be perfectly symmetrical and therefore allow you to find a local minimum. But that&#x27;s like trying to optimize the amount of poison to put in your food as a preservative. Is it not better to just use a non-poisonous preservative?",1413652945

A player with those cards will usually win against one without them anyway.  Those cards cost $20 bucks or something to get.  But thats not the reason I don&#x27;t upgrade.  The reason is I don&#x27;t want to have those cards and be matched up with someone who doesn&#x27;t have them.  Players with nax cards should be matched with only other players who have them.  Blizzard has built in a disincentive for players like me to buy their expansion.",1413651806

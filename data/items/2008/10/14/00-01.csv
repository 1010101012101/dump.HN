I think that the more open video is, the better it is for people. My gripe lies entirely with the fact that YouTube is an extremely ugly site, and with video - unlike some things - there are <i>very</i> attractive sites to compare with. Vimeo and Hulu do it right, both the overall aesthetic and the vanishing bar in particular. YouTube makes it so that I would never be able to really use my computer like a television, whereas in Hulu I can get fairly high-resolution video of, say, Arrested Development, and watch it in an environment that's even slightly better than watching it on TV.",1223945166

331770,comment,330981,331601,0,0,emmett,,,"There are, of course, a few doctors who reject the very idea that mere scientific evidence should be able to tell them what to do. But in general, most doctors want to provide the best care they can for their patients, and that includes scientific evidence.<p>However, it's extremely common for doctors to prescribe medicine off-label, before the full level three trials have completed for that use (which can take a decade). There is often compelling evidence a medicine is effective (in the Bayesian sense) far before there is official ""Evidence"" which counts for ""Evidence Based Medicine"".<p>The very fact that it's called ""Evidence Based Medicine"" should set off alarm bells. Being against it sounds like being against science in medicine, which would just be stupid. In fact, it's code for ""restrict public care facilities from being able to offer a full range of medical benefits to conserve money"".",1223944906

I don't think that by the time you aggregate it and compare it to income the numbers have any meaning whatsoever. Lots of correlation in the world. Lots of folks who don't know science.

331760,comment,331485,331485,0,0,time_management,,,"For these sorts of questions, the water is very muddy in the US, due to the proliferation of consumer goods. That's the thing that happens in a rich society; people who are unhappy for social and economic reasons (shitty health coverage, unable to afford ridiculous housing/higher education costs) are still able to buy a lot of trinkets which, of course, fail to deliver on the hedonic promise. Rich is definitely better than poor, but clutter does not equate to wealth, and often makes a person worse off rather than happier.<p>Someone might be unhappy because of his mediocre health coverage (even the insured are screwed), low occupational autonomy, meager two weeks' vacation allowance, inability to reach the level of stability necessary to responsibly procreate, et al. He's 35 and not really poor; he has enough discretionary income to buy a $30,000 SUV-- which would be considered a luxury outside of the US (in Europe, because of the high gas prices moreso than the cost of the car). He does this to procure ""happiness"". It fails him (he returns to baseline) after three weeks. Why did he buy it? Because he lacks the power to make meaningful improvements to his life, whereas trinkets are cheap.<p>""Consumption"" is a poor predictor of happiness because most consumptive activity is utterly devoid of hedonic value. On the other hand, increased security and autonomy would make people legitimately happier.",1223943943

If you type a word, the whole word looks selected, even though it doesn't act that way.  If you hold down the delete key, it deletes one character and stops.  It works really well if you already know what you're typing and make no mistakes, but slightly less well otherwise.<p>I really like what the Mac does here: use underline to indicate ""still working on this word"", so selection still means selection.

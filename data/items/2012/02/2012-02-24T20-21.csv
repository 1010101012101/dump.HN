If you've watched videos online before, you know it's just buffering, but the tv-oriented kid would do the same thing as this guy's kid did: ask if it's broken, or why we stopped it.<p>I'm not saying that there are no problems with the way TV is presented, but to raise a child in a relatively TV-less environment,  marvel at their confusion over how it works, and then come to the conclusion that TV is broken... that doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense to me.",1330117149

For one, that quest is how better languages are developed.<p>But there is another thing that bothers me. A lot of languages are good enough, and could be considerably better, if only the designers were not stubborn, or if only they had the resources and the will to break backwards compatibility for a while.<p>Take Python for example. Wouldn't it be better with:<p>- A better default UI kit than TK.
- The GIL removed.
- A JIT of JVM calibre.
- Something like goroutines.
- Optional static typing (and/or type inference).
- Some way of AOT compilation (with an appropriate runtime).
- Proper and easy to use closures (like Ruby/JS etc).
- A better syntax to replace the double underscore thing.
- Something like Virtualenv built-in.
- Something like PIP built-in.
- A redesigned base library, with the cruft removed and simpler interfaces<p>For a lot of those, there exist workarounds, half-baked implementations, etc.<p>Now, some people will say: ""those will complicate the language"", etc. But most of those changes are orthogonal,  remove very real pain points, and some are even totally transparent to the programmer (like the GIL removal, or the JIT presence), while others enable totally new ways of using it. So, most complaints are of the ""I don't want any change"" variety.<p>Consider this thought experiment, to obliterate those complaints: if Python DIDN'T ALREADY EXIST AT ALL, and you were presented with two languages, one like the above (Python-A) and another like the existing 3.0 one (Python-B), which would you prefer?<p>I'd say that despite the complaints from current Python users on the changes above, 100% of the people would take Python-A. Right?<p>Now, nothing on the list is technically impossible (most are quite normal). But they require: the will of the core maintainers, a community to do them, money to back them up, etc. Actually, it just takes a major lead like Guido to be hell-bent on them, and lots of money, but not that much.<p>So, while a ""perfect Python"" (or a 100% improved one) is a possibility, it's sad to see that it's not actually achievable.<p>I can find similar pain points for most other languages (a PHP with a re-organized basic library with sane conventions and namespacing,  a Javascript that's at Harmony-level on every browser, Ruby with better performance, Go with some way to write generic code besides interface{}, C with actual fuckin' strings, etc etc).",1330117016

But records don't really bother her. She thinks they're weird because they're so big, and you have to find them and put them on the player and be careful with the needle.<p>But she happily drags out the player, shuffles through the handful of records I have and listens to them from time to time.<p>Yet she had a very similar reaction to what's described in the article, when she (briefly) saw Shrek on Cable.  Her grandmother (the only one in her family who watches broadcast anymore) flipped through the channels and passed Shrek, whereupon my niece convinced her that they should watch it. After the first commercial break she asked if we could just watch it on the Boxee.<p>So it's not ""child notices change"".  Not entirely.

But that severely restricts your defense.</i><p>TrueCrypt is not meant to hold file systems any more than a hard drive is. There is nothing stopping you from <i>not</i> creating a file system on your truecrypt volume and just storing garbage in it - or use another encryption software on top of it.<p>TrueCrypts hidden-volume feature is quite meaningless in most cases (my opinion) due to the way it is likely used. If you present a decryption key that gives access to a filesystem that does not match what was expected then you are in trouble.<p>Especially the hidden OS feature... So you have been using this laptop on multiple occasions the last week (of which we have proof) but according to the filesystem you presented to us this system haven't been used for over a month.<p>The same goes for a hidden volume. Unless you actively use it as often as you use your device (which is <i>really</i> cumbersome to do right) you might just be better of without it since exposing it will tell them way more than you want to tell them (for starters it will tell them that you are actively lying and having made precautions in order to try and get away with lying).",1330116809

The advertiser does not put enough money in to fully test the product/niche/demographic<p>2. The product targeting mix is not well thought through, targets too many people or doesn't take in to account other factors.<p>3. The advertiser is not testing enough ads to find what gets people to respond.<p>There are many more reasons as well, and I won't try and cover them all here. Suffice to say, most of the time people don't really put enough on the line to find where they can succeed with FB ads. This has kept the market fairly clear for people like me - I'll happily drop $1k to test something, because if even 1-2 ad/target combos is reliably profitable, I know I've hit something.<p>A very broad range of products work quite easily, you just have to break out of the old mold of thinking in terms of direct interest -> product correlation. For example, you aren't really going to sell jeans to people that like ""clothes"".<p>Think broader - target people that like home improvement and give them ads that say ""Toughest Jeans Ever / (pic of dirty as hell jeans) / Work in the garden or change a sink, it doesn't matter.

While this may be a temporary trend as we adapt to the information overload the internet can provide, I think it's fairly safe to say that people 10 years from now will be far less likely to sit patiently watching TV than people 20 years ago.<p>The most obvious implication from this may be that commercial advertising, rather than TV in general, is going to need to adapt.  I imagine part of the reason why people under 30 are cutting the cable in increasing numbers is because they aren't willing to sit through loud, irrelevant commercials in order to watch something they don't <i>actually</i> want to watch.  The tolerance of the consumer for TV style advertising is shrinking proportionally to the consumer's attention span.  This should be good for subscription services like Netflix, and would be good for HBO/Showtime if they didn't for customers to pay for cable/sat in addition to their services.",1330116442

Most browsers in TLS ClientHello send an empty compression algorithm list since they will use encoding headers (which let the servers cache the compressed data).  A browser using Spdy could indicate it supports deflate to enable compression.<p>> Also, you claim that Google is basing this protocol on assumptions and you imply that they do not understand the value of metrics. I strongly disagree with this sentiment<p>Watch the tech talk video the other guy posted and drink when they say 'we assume' or to that effect.  These guys do testing to confirm their assumptions.  Take a look at when a questioner asks about high packet loss and how they hand-wave away Spdy being crippled by high packet loss.<p>> because SPDY headers are length-prefixed for ease of parsing. It compresses better when the prefix is included in the dictionary; such that {0x00,0x00,0x00,0x07,o,p,t,i,o,n,s,} would compress to one byte, not 5<p>No, wrong, that's not how compression works.  Deflate uses lz to compress runs and repeats like \0\0\0 and it uses huffman to better encode it to bits.<p>Here's a clue for you, compressing ""\0\0\0\7options"" using deflate:<p><pre><code>    spdy prefix: 7 bytes
    w/o repeats: 6 bytes
    w/o any counts: 6 bytes
</code></pre>
The first is the rfc draft dictionary, the second is that with only the first occurrence of each count, and the third with on \0\0\0 at the start and no other counts.<p>Not even to mention there is limited space in the prefix due to the window size and it sliding, so not only are the counts basically useless but they use space that could be used for other data.<p>I take it back... these people don't just lack rigor, they are clueless bordering on incompetent.

They need something very reliable obviously, but they're not sitting on their hands. Instead they're constantly pushing their vendors for less latency, more bandwidth and faster storage.",1330113702

What it feels like centuries can be a fraction of second for such hardware.<p>With this kind of simulations you can obtain, in theory, ""what if"" universes where alternatives solutions and technologies can be created. If you can observe them and the simulation rate is faster than your own time, it can be a rewarding experiment.<p>About universe observing, this story is cool: <a href=""http://qntm.org/responsibility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qntm.org/responsibility</a>",1330113689

They're not bricking because of being drained, they're bricking because they're drained and then left for months. Do this to any other Li-Ion device and the same thing will happen.<p>More generally, you jumped to conclusions based on personal anecdotal evidence, ignored the entire preceding discussion, then pretended you were some kind of PR expert based on stuff you just made up.<p>(Edit: I guess the accusations are that some earlier battery models discharge in a week or a few, not months. I'm told the charge management circuitry of the 6000+ cell battery is extremely complicated, so improvement over time is to be expected. Nevertheless it's not a case of ""duh just disconnect the battery""--these things self-discharge and also discharge very slowly over the disconnection circuitry!)",1330113612

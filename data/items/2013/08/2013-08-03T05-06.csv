6151294,comment,6150646,6150854,1,0,ereckers,,,"A lot of the more attractive themes at say Themeforest for instance are simply HTML, CSS, and jquery. At this point you&#x27;re only constricted by the ease of templating whichever CMS/thing you&#x27;re using, whether WordPress, Drupal, Expression Engine etc.. I still think WordPress does a good job, better/best job even and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s currently king of the user base. However, the Internet is fickle and people will bail for something better at the drop of a hat, network effects or not.",1375509418
6151293,comment,6150603,6150997,17,0,matchu,,,"Two important Python notes:<p>1. `is` really shouldn&#x27;t be used for string comparison. It checks object identities rather than string equality, which is broken here for two reasons: first, because it depends on the interpreter to keep one true copy of `&#x27;&#x27;` (which CPython seems to do, but doesn&#x27;t have to by the spec), and, second, it doesn&#x27;t even work consistently in CPython anyway if `expr` is a Unicode string, since `&#x27;&#x27; is not u&#x27;&#x27;`. (Try replacing `expr` with `u&#x27;28+32+++32++39&#x27;` and you&#x27;ll get an error.)<p>2. If an object is known to be a string, test non-emptiness by testing the string itself: `bool(&#x27;&#x27;) == False`, whereas `bool(&#x27;any other string&#x27;) == True`. It&#x27;s more concise and is equally clear to someone comfortable with Python.<p>I agree that the given example of functional programming is pretty ugly (though it might&#x27;ve been chosen just to illustrate the author&#x27;s specific points), but I think the version below is really quite nice <i>and</i> won&#x27;t break on the string comparison.<p><pre><code>    expr = &#x27;28+32+++32++39&#x27;

As a fellow pythonista, I can guarantee you that using the builtin higher-order functions excessively will cause you nothing but pain. The feeling of being lost when you revisit code will be common.<p>I had a coworker who undertook a plan similar to yours, except he gave himself less rigid constraints. He is a very smart guy but he fell into the tar pit of code masturbation and couldn&#x27;t finish the project he took on. He simply couldn&#x27;t manage the complexity of his application in his quest to be As Functional As Possible. The project was never completed and after wasting many man hours, the company was forced to purchase $25,000+ worth of software to compensate. It didn&#x27;t reflect well on him.<p>Python has functional programming support, but it&#x27;s not intended to be the dominant paradigm. Python 3 even removed reduce as a builtin. The high order functions are still useful, but definitely not all the time. The principles of functional programming, such as limiting side effects and statefulness, are always useful. But Python has awful lambdas and no lexical scoping (fixed in 3). Python&#x27;s functional support will always be hobbled as Guido doesn&#x27;t support it.<p>Since you seem to have a healthy interest in functional programming, I&#x27;d suggest looking at Clojure. If you want to challenge yourself, it&#x27;s a good choice as you&#x27;d have to learn lisp (macros, code is data, s-exprs, etc) and the JVM ecosystem, while being almost totally constrained to writing functional code. Haskell is even more strict and is a pure functional language, forbidding state entirely and relying on monads for things like I/O. I almost like it as much as Clojure. Erlang and Ocaml are also worth checking out.",1375509018

6151223,comment,6150603,6150603,11,0,dev360,,,"So I felt really torn with this. I applaud the author for introducing Python devs to FP; I love functional programming. Python was one of the things that opened my eyes to FP with its cute little m/r syntax and for that I&#x27;m forever grateful.<p>Over the years, I have found that python code that people write to solve problems will fall in roughly four categories: a) completely ignorant and inefficient code; b) concise, idiomatic python code with a focus on readability; c) fancy functional code where the author is showing off their FP savvy (peppered with recursion and m/r); and d) raw, boring C-influenced code that looks primitive and boring to read, but is incredibly efficient and algorithmically sound. As much as I used to love going for b), I then prided myself for writing c). But last few years I have realized how under performing c) is for most serious work, so I tend to avoid it and try to strike a balance between d) and b), but preferably the latter. To write code in c) and tell yourself, well the data size will never be so great that the stack will blow, or memory will suffer, is in many ways just like avoiding null checks all together and saying to yourself your data will always have perfect integrity... e.g. any sane person will tell you that you cannot rely on this mindset in the long run.<p>So, for me at least it comes down to this: to try to pretend that you can write FP code effectively in Python is an exercise in futility. FP is more than writing a map and reduce. If thats your basis of reasoning, yeah I agree take that and run with it - I find m/r to be a neat syntax to use here and there in your program but its really challenging to write a whole program in python that is composed of several chained map / reduce functions to a large extent because things are not oriented around generators by default.. I&#x27;m not saying its impossible, just that it goes against the grain. I also argue that recursion and guard expressions (and lazy evaluation) are at the heart of the FP paradigm and if you want to do it right, then its just retarded to sit and do this in Python when there is no tail recursion.. how are you going to appreciate this concept when its so limiting?? If you want to muse yourself and marvel at pretty code, write it like this and have fun with it, but please pick another language if you want to actually ship production code.<p>And ... so sorry to piss on the parade.",1375507053

I have a couple of points.<p>&quot;What we&#x27;d hoped to accomplish, and fell short on in the end, was a way for developers with non-traditional backgrounds find gainful employment.&quot;<p>First: I think you&#x27;ll find that a lot of developers have &quot;non-traditional backgrounds&quot; (where by &quot;non-traditional&quot; you mean &quot;didn&#x27;t graduate in CS&quot;, I&#x27;m guessing). Is a person with a MS in CS going to have an easier time finding a job in, say, Iowa? Maybe they are, maybe they aren&#x27;t. If someone is having a hard time getting their foot in the door in Iowa because they don&#x27;t have a degree, giving them +K isn&#x27;t going to help much (and I&#x27;m guessing you found this out from the companies you contracted with).<p>Second: &quot;There&#x27;s a huge disconnect between what developers want and what companies want. You&#x27;re going to have to reach out to developers who fit.&quot; I know this is too late, but that statement should have been front and center on your site. You&#x27;re hiding the true intentions of your application behind this layer of developer competition, when in reality &quot;We can help you find a job&quot; should have been your number one point. (In the language of your site, &quot;Discover&quot; should have been front and center, and &quot;Compete&quot; should have been 86&#x27;ed.)<p>Last, the remote thing: I don&#x27;t think that there is -- yet -- enough of a market for recruiting agencies for remote workers, especially at your typical Fortune 500 company. Office culture is ingrained in this country, and probably will be for another generation or two. If someone is in a &quot;weird location&quot; and they&#x27;re unwilling to accept a relocation offer, that&#x27;s (currently) a massive hurdle in their career growth, and as a talent agent it&#x27;s up to you to tell people this.

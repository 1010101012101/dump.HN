After he wrote mongrel, he was jobless and nearly homeless for an extended period if time.<p>That just doesn't sit right with me as being truthful.  How can a person, who is otherwise a qualified developer, write one of the most well-known pieces of the Rails infrastructure, but suddenly be jobless?  I wrote a shitty weather app and got 3 gig offers within a day.  How can you be a household name within the Rails community and not have a job?<p>By being an arrogant asshole?  By demanding outrageous fees?  By demanding outrageous control over projects?  All three?",1199144736

We absolutely want to add a shortcut, but don't know how to do it in Chrome yet (some research is in order).<p>You can already search for time ranges (the syntax is a bit weird, though), it's ""added:[2010-07-01T00:00:00Z TO 2010-08-01T00:00:00Z]"", for example.<p>We are also planning to support better autocompletion, as well as bulk edits/deletions.

1607391,comment,1607217,1607217,0,0,hooande,,,"AdSense was designed to help Google offload their abundance of keyword inventory. They have millions of people bidding on keywords. Web pages have keywords. So AdSense is a great tool to help them sell what they already have.<p>Adsense wasn't designed with increasing publisher revenue in mind. Google doesn't operate it as a primary business and the revenue ig make pales in comparison to search advertising. That's why they don't act like any sane business when it comes to customer service. Ads might stop working. They certainly won't give you answers as to why. You may make a lot of money or only a little this month. On the whole, they don't care.<p>Google has actually changed the name to ""Google Display"" and a lot of the ads that I see are retargeted. I don't know if this is actually increasing publisher revenues, but I would love to hear first hand about that from the HN community.<p>By and large, AdSense will work well for you if a high percentage (>60%) of the traffic to your site is based on search queries. It works best as an extension of the search advertising process. If you have a community or user generated content, then you'll need to find another solution.",1281955884

At adsense income levels reocities will <i>never</i> be profitable, and I have a couple of <i>thousand</i> thank you notes collected by now that prove that on the whole people are pretty happy that I did what I did.<p>People that request removal of their pages have it backed up now (I do that for whoever asks to create a zip file of all their content), and those that don't want their old stuff online any more because it is either inaccurate or because they can't update it (reocities is 'read only').<p>In some cases they want it removed because they put private info online back when everybody did that or because they are now professional designers and don't want their geocities stuff to haunt them.<p>And, of course, whoever asks has their content removed, once every month or so I filter my inbox on 'reocities' and 'geocities' to process the removal requests.<p>It's still a manual process, that's how little it gets requested, but I probably should automate it somehow.<p>If in the long run reocities contains no pages and all the stuff has been moved to the proper owners again then I'll be more than happy, that would be the best outcome.<p>Having some adsense ads in there was a way to offset some (but not all by a long shot) of the hosting costs.",1281955794

I used to find it easy to immerse myself in a book or a lengthy article. [...] Now my concentration starts to drift after a page or two. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else to do. I feel as though I’m always dragging my wayward brain back to the text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle.<p>> The author is Nicholas Carr. According to Wikipedia Mr Carr was both in 1959 and thus is now 51. Like me, Mr Carr is aging, unlike me Mr Carr seems to be blaming changes in the operation of his mind on the Internet.<p>I'm 31 and I feel same change in how my mind works when confronted with a book as Nicolas Carr does. I can't blame aging and I've spent most of my time for last few years reading the internet so there might be something to it.<p>It might not necessarily be bad. I was always impatient with books that had low ideas/wordcount quotient. I couldn't force myself to read Hobbit and I fell asleep on Bladerunner at the same time immensly enjoying short stories by Henry Kuttner.

It's a bit more complicated than that and depends on how targeted your app/site is, as well as how much traffic you are getting.<p>Small startups with a lot of possible advertising topics can't solicit every possible niche. You would have to have a sales person selling bingo ads one minute, then the other niche, then the other niche etc. and then manage all those relationships.<p>What Adsense does is manage all that for you. No salesperson investment, no ad software investment, no prospecting etc. Also, Adsense does some other things like customizes the ad to the user's behavior (across sites), not just the page content.<p>Maybe what you are saying makes sense in the case of Demand Media because they have a lot of sales people.<p>But it's not practical for a small startup if they cover more than a few topics. They will end up with less-targeted run of site ads with lower CPM and more ad management headaches.",1281955006

A publisher lives or dies on the competence of their ad sales department and their ability to convince advertisers that space in their publication is worth more than just eyeballs.<p>It's obvious to all of us that a click isn't just a click. There are quality clicks and bad clicks. There is clear value in advertising even with no direct response. It's up to you as a publisher to convince advertisers that your readers are richer or more spendy or more enthusiastic or more easily persuaded than Joe Random.<p>Print publishers laugh at us for our naïveté. As online publishers, we just don't have the cultural sense that our job is to match up advertisers with people who want to be advertised to. That's the real value-add of ad-supported media, the content itself is just a hook to attract and retain the right demographic.<p>Ad sales is an active pursuit. If you're waiting for people to find you, you're doing it wrong. If you're expecting advertisers to know what space to buy, you're doing it wrong. If you're not thinking in terms of campaigns and strategy, you're doing it wrong. If you're not pursuing ongoing relationships with agencies, you're doing it wrong.<p>If you were an advertiser, would you buy advertising from you?",1281953786

I registered a while back for corporate perks (http://www.corporateperks.com/), another site which claims to use collective bargaining based on what employer you work for.
I removed my account shortly since I learned they didn't have anything for Ireland. Ever since, I am getting few advertisement emails from some third parties (US specific). Now, I have a strong reason to believe they sold my id to spammers, since there we only 2 websites who knew it (other being facebook). + I never shared my email to any forum etc... And from the nature spam emails (mainly sent to entice managers et al), I can be fairly sure that it www.corporateperks.com.<p>I am really annoyed by that, thanks to my spam-intolerantness. Is there anyway I can stop this, fight back?",1281953752

I'm thinking about that due to the low price of these boxes. Myself, I have a small QNAP and even if the ram is low and the processor also, I thought that having like 10 of these boxes would be great to experiment stuffs like hadoop or distributed cheap web hosting.<p>(Look at the prices, you can get a 1.2Ghz for like $150. That makes 10 nas for $1500)<p>Did anyone here try something like that ?",1281953397

1607324,comment,1606073,1606073,0,0,forinti,,,"I've just read most of ""Kicking Away The Ladder"" (2002, Ha-Joon Chang) and this work makes it clear that Henry VII started the whole textile business in the XVI century. He had lived in the Netherlands, saw the wealth that it created, and put in motion policies geared towards building an industry in Britain (restricting exports and hiring dutch craftsmen). His successors continued his work and in the XVIII century this industry accounted for half of Britain's export revenue.<p>This book is quite interesting; it argues that those economic policies that rich countries now sell to developing nations (through the Washington Consensus, for instance) were actually only put in place after they had become developed. These policies include IP rights, opening up of markets, less government intervention (that's laughable), etc.",1281952819

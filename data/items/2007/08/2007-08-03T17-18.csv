39081,story,,,4,8,samb,"Crowds vs. Herds",,"I read Dharmesh Shah's ""Lamenting the Loss of Reddit"" at onstartups.com, which furter fueled a notion that's been brewing for some time now.<p>When does the Wisdom of Crowds become Herd Mentality? And why? The easy answer is that with wider adoption it's inevitable. Early adopters are, I would propose, more interesting people, generally, than later waves of mass market users.<p>If you're a social media startup is it an unconscious goal to make your community boring? Are Paris Hilton threads a sign of success?<p>This is only a thought stub, put out quickly. I'm interested to know what others think about this.",1186163764

39067,comment,38829,38916,0,0,palish,,,"Listen, I agree with you in spirit, but it's not practical.  Here's what I have no problem with:<p>Let's say foo is 15 and he wants to download Super Expensive Program 9000.  He spends all day looking for a torrent.  Then, once he's downloaded it, the next day it takes him another full day to figure out how to install it and get the various cracks working and everything configured.<p>Right, that's fine.  Here's the problem:<p>Time passes, foo's grown up.  He's 25, and a software engineer, making $75k a year.  He goes to thepiratebay.org and finds Super Expensive Program 9000 immediately.  He downloads it in about an hour.  It installs immediately with no requirement to apply a crack or any other technical detail.  It just installs and works.<p>Okay, I have a problem with the second one, because once piracy becomes a one-click solution it starts to hurt those that make the program.  The first isn't a problem because 15 year olds don't buy programs anyway, but they might buy it when they grow up (Like I did with Visual Assist).<p>If there's a way to make it artificially hard to get something for free, I say let them get it, because only the committed will be able to.  If it's easy (Napster, ThePirateBay, etc) it needs to be made harder.<p>Also, making money by giving away people's work for free in a one-click solution is just evil.  If you're going to give it away for free, make it hard, and don't make any money from it.",1186161455

39064,story,,,1,1,wensing,"Spatial data warehousing in PostgreSQL",,"In the very near future I will need to create a data warehouse for storing a rather large amount of data.  I'm not sure what it will be in terabytes, but let's just say that it won't be huge instantly, but it will be big instantly, and need to scale to support whatever new data sets (dimensions) get thrown its way.<p>The language will be Python (Django), but I'm waffling on the database.  All of my experience is with MySQL, but I believe the out-of-the-box support for some of the software we'll be using is PostgreSQL.<p>Do any of you have experience with data warehousing?  What about a data warehouse with spatial features?  And what of the trade-offs between MySQL and PostgreSQL for this task?<p>Any information/links you can provide on any of these subjects would be fantastic.  ",1186161118

6700474,comment,6695540,6700011,1,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I&#x27;ve had customers use their credit card on my online store. Buy the product. Have it mailed to their house with their name on it. Forget what they bought and initiate a chargeback. I would then give the credit card company everything they asked for. Phone numbers, addresses, delivery confirmations, emails. And the chargeback would still go through. Until I hound the customer down and explain to them what the charge is for then they finally after weeks call back their credit card company and explain everything and me finally end up getting paid.<p>The CC companies Do. Not. Listen. It&#x27;s not &quot;tough&quot;, they&#x27;re just stupid and don&#x27;t investigate. It&#x27;s cheaper that way. They need you to use their card so they can make money, and we need them to accept payments so they screw us over. They need you so they side with the card holder, we sellers need them so they treat us like crap. They assume that we businesses have money to spare and can handle a few chargebacks so they don&#x27;t bother with any investigating.<p>You losing your card, not having a pin number and someone else using it to buy products is not my fault. That is your fault and the credit card companies fault for making a little piece of plastic representing $3,000-$12,000 work without a password. Why should I get screwed over for that?",1383965744

More than anything, it&#x27;s about gaining confidence, learning some basic etiquette, grooming essentials, and a little bit of other stuff.

Better posture, better clothes, a fresh haircut, smiling more, and not being scared of, or intimidated by, beautiful women, is the heart of PUA-dom.<p>And to be quite frank, these days, the &quot;PUA community&quot; has really outgrown it&#x27;s roots and become the &quot;male self-help and improvement community&quot;.

Enterprises like to use the same analytics platform across everything so they don&#x27;t need to maintain staff and contracts with multiple vendors.<p>With that said, a reason Google Analytics is free is because it let&#x27;s Google track users once they leave Google and enter web-sites. Or at least Google could, by using co-relating users to search clicks. They aren&#x27;t involved in the space out of the pure kindness of their hearts, and Google Analytics doubtlessly loses lots of money every quarter for Google.<p>&quot;I&#x27;d rather trust a specialized analytics company&quot; - don&#x27;t.

Then they can focus on what people are using and what they should pitch towards.

A lot of existing Python code relies on implicit assumptions about the parameters of functions, e.g. &quot;this is an iterable&quot; or &quot;this is a number or supports some numeric operations&quot;. I know there are some Python libraries that formalize interfaces like this, but I can&#x27;t see a good way of doing it nicely in general and being able to calculate the types of everything (with or without explicit annotations). Someone can correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but I don&#x27;t think Scala or Clojure code has this problem.",1383963497

We need solid file hosting with lots of bandwidth (pushing well over 50TB a month at SF) that will be sticking around next month and next year.  In my comment linked above, I mention that Github ditched binary downloads (they did last year).  In the ensuing discussion, it was pointed out that Github added the feature back in this year as &#x27;Releases&#x27;.  It remains to be seen if the feature will stick around, though, and I wouldn&#x27;t put my all my eggs in that basket.  When Github discontinued binary downloads last year, users were offered no alternative.  So, it&#x27;s not inconceivable that Github would pull the binary hosting feature again in the future as they stabilize their product offerings.

That&#x27;s doubly true if not everyone is even subject to the policy (e.g. first-line or second-line managers).<p>Think of it this way: if you selected the bottom 10% of a company, would the results always have exactly 10% of each team?

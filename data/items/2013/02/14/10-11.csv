5218868,comment,5215884,5217742,3,0,vidarh,,,">  Previously it seems that only one request could be handled by the dyno so requests had to queue on the dynamic routing layer but with multiple request support with unicorn or whatever, wouldn't it be more efficient to dump all the requests to dynos?<p>It would be if all requests were equal. If all your requests always take 100ms, spreading them equally would work fine.<p>But consider if one of them takes longer. Doesn't have to be much, but the effect will be much more severe if you e.g. have a request that grinds the disk for a few seconds.<p>Even if each dyno can handle more than one requests, since those requests share resources, if some of them slows down due to some long running request, response times for the other requests are likely to increase, and as response times increase, it's queue is likely to increase further, and it gets more likely to pile up more long running requests.<p>> Followup question, also how would intelligent routing work if it just previously checked to see if which dyno had no requests? That seems like an easy thing to do, now you would have to check CPU/IO whatever and route based on load. Not specifically targeted at you but to everyone reading the thread.<p>There is no perfect answer. Just routing by least connections is one option. it will hurt some queries that will end up being piled up on servers processing a heavy request in high load situations, but pretty soon any heavily loaded servers will have enough connections all the time that most new requests will go to lighter loaded servers.<p>Adding ""buckets"" of servers for different types of requests is one option to improve it, if you can easily tell by url which requests will be slow.",1360839048

You probably also think that cold water freezes faster than hot.  Taking the thimbleful of knowledge that you have and making snap judgements based on it will often mislead you.<p>In the case of the cars, without looking it up it is not obvious to me which is worse - the energy loss in starting and stopping at low speeds, or the quadratically scaling energy loss from wind resistance at high speeds.  Certainly if you go fast enough you'll find that your driving range drops substantially - this is why the old 55 mph limit was passed during the oil crisis.<p>If I am not certain without looking it up, then I can't fault someone else for not knowing it either.<p>About the water, if you have equal amounts of hot and cold water in wooden buckets and put them out in the snow, the hot water can easily freeze faster.

The car does not appear to have lost much charge overnight, but with a cold battery, it's discharging much faster just after he starts driving again.  Thus the range remaining is pretty low, even though the battery is still charged.

For some reason though, the range remaining graph doesn't increase after the battery warms up, when you would think it should.<p>From looking at these graphs, it doesn't look to me that there's a problem with losing charge, but there may be a problem with how the state of charge is reported as range.",1360838128

All that is needed is a ""maximum number of simultaneous connections to pass to this backend"" setting coupled with load balancing by available slots rather than purely randomly.<p>The issue here isn't that Rails needs to be treated specially - this problem applies to various extent in <i>any</i> type of backend where some types of requests might turn out to be computationally heavy or require lots of IO. You can't magic away that: A request that takes 8 CPU seconds will take 8 CPU seconds. If you start piling more requests onto that server, response times will increase, even if some will keep responding, and if another 8 CPU second request hits too soon, chances increase that a third one will, and a fourth, and before you know it you might have a pileup where available resources for new requests on a specific instance are rapidly diminishing and response times shoot through the roof.<p>Pure random distribution is horrible for that reason pretty much regardless.<p>Now, doing ""intelligent"" routing <i>is</i> a lot easier for servers with <i>some</i> concurrency, as you can ""just"" have check  requests and measure latency for the response and pick servers based on current low latency and get 90% there and that will be enough for most applications. Sure, the lower the concurrency, the more you risk having multiple heavy queries hit the same server and slow things down, and this request grows dramatically with the number of load balancers randomly receiving inbound requests to pass on, but at least you escape the total pileup more often.<p>But that's also a clue to one possible approach for non-concurrent servers: group them into buckets handled by a single active load balancer at a time and have front ends that identifies the right second layer load balancers. Shared state is now reduced to having the front end load balancers know which second layer load balancers are the currently active ones for each type of backend. It costs you an extra load balancer layer with according overhead. But don't you think OP would prefer an extra 10ms per request over the behaviour he's seen?",1360837671

Is someone in trouble, or did a dumb tweet get faved by someone? That game can erode attention after awhile. With the Pebble, I can discreetly glance at my wrist without breaking the flow of conversation.""<p>In what way is this giving someone your undivided attention? You're just slightly modifying the division of your attention and making it easier to hide that you're thinking about something else.<p>Personally I find a better solution is to either be honest and put your phone on the desk and explain to people that you might be getting a call you need to take, or put it somewhere you can't see, hear or feel it and genuinely disengage.<p>Not saying I don't like the Pebble, I do, just that I don't think this is a great use case for it.",1360836508

5218766,comment,5200916,5201849,1,0,earthboundkid,,,"Some thoughts in defense of Go's use of capitalization. First of all, public/private are used in languages with classes. It would be misleading in Go, since visibility is at the package level.<p>Second, if Go didn't use capitalization and wanted to keep package level visibility (which I will strongly argue is the Right Thing), there would be choice of having both private and public as keywords and requiring one of the pair to be put before before all constants, package level variables, type declarations, struct members, functions, and methods -- creating an immense amount of noise -- or to have one of the two and make the other one the default. Probably it would make more sense to have everything private by default and public only when prefixed with public But it would be really ugly and inconsistent.<p>Now it might be possible to get around this with some other convention. Maybe it could be like Python, where everything is public by default but private if it starts with _. Or it could use a different, shorter keyword like 'p' so there's less noise overall<p>But I think that once you make the decision to have package level visibility, case is the most efficient way of expressing it.",1360836439

Sinatra's hello world is awesome, until you realize that a lot of the cool stuff is scoping magic that you have to throw out when your app has to play nicely with others.<p>My original approach for (fab) was like jQuery:<p><pre><code>  fab()
    .find( path )
      .bind( method, handler )
      .find( subpath )
        .bind( method, handler )
      .end()
    .end()
  .end()
</code></pre>
but I realized that I could simplify things by getting rid of methods entirely, and reserving methods for HTTP methods and status codes.<p>As for people not realizing they can define functions outside of the DSL, I'm hoping that the extensibility of middleware will mitigate that, just as the ecosystem of plugins did for jQuery.",1264719499

You can take the value of fab, use standard for loops and if statements and whatnot to apply things to it, then call fab again at the end and it'll all work fine. By hiding in a DSL here, you encourage people to not realize that, and take away the ability for these people to use the Javascript they already know to build the system.

You're almost certain to end up having more than one type of thing go in those arguments, and the alternative will be either returning to method chaining, or using the first argument to do nothing other than switch on which method you actually call.

1085200,comment,1082325,1085071,0,0,philwelch,,,"Wikipedia:<p>---<p>Although it is widely believed that the word football, or ""foot ball"", originated in reference to the action of a foot kicking a ball, this may be a false etymology. The historical explanation has it that the word originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot.[2] These sports were usually played by peasants, as opposed to the horse-riding sports more often enjoyed by aristocrats. This explanation is supported by the fact that the word football has always implied a wide variety of games played on foot, not just those that revolved around kicking a ball. In some cases, the word has been applied to games which involved carrying a ball and specifically banned kicking. For example, the English writer William Hone, writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir Frederick Morton Eden, regarding a game — which Hone refers to as ""Foot-Ball"" — played in the parish 
of Scone, Scotland:<p>The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party, but no person was allowed to kick it.[3] [Emphasis added.]<p>However, there is no conclusive evidence for either hypothesis regarding the origins of the word.<p>---<p>So, it's not as clear cut as I thought, but there it is.",1264716795

First it's possibility, then power/flexibility, then price, then convenience/usability.  iPods and mp3 players got cheap enough that the usability of th iPod/iTunes Music Store became the deciding factor and there was no demand for undercutting it on price.<p>Also, the music use case is so well defined that there wasn't much room to compete on flexibility.  PCs have miles and miles of flexibility, but by defining the role of the iPad as music, movies, books, and games (basically media consumption), it might be staking out a territory where it can outperform everyone rather than compete with commodity devices.",1264716750

1678118,comment,1673130,1676267,0,0,mfukar,,,"I happen to be somewhat familiar, since I've been living there for 26 years. The majority of state enterprises (or those the state has a share in) right now are profitable, with the notable exceptions of a) railroads and b) the off-the-books units created by ministries to handle short-term tasks. Could they benefit from a restructuring and would lay offs be helpful? Probably so.<p>Does the state's involvement in public corporation screw up incentives? Telecommunications is a good example of why not. Banks still don't convince me; they pay taxes with interest rates significantly less than 18-20%, which is the norm and they have resisted any and all attempts of the state for policy changes.<p>Personally, I am more concerned with other issues: the legislation that often proves to be shortsighted and inefficient, limited (and that's a euphemism) opportunities to young entrepreneurs, poor education, but the one thing that bugs me the most is that Greeks (yeah, I'm one of them) have no regard for public interest. The why is a longer story than what can fit in this post.<p>PS.

Help the ones that want the help and go from there.<p>One simple way would be to list out the top 7 SAFE actions that you've taken that have helped with your CF. Put that on your front page. And then from there link to other pieces of information. That way the user has something useful right on the front page. 
The pared down checklist might be good enough. Right now its a link that I had to find - it would be good to put the most important information on the front page.<p>After that you need to make the site more legible w.r.t font-size and the colors and the general design.<p>From a tactical standpoint I would advertise for a web designer who also has CF.

Players perform basic tasks — clicking on crops to harvest them, clicking on stoves in restaurants, clicking on fish to feed them — earn fake money, enhance their farm or restaurant or aquarium, and repeat. In Zynga's hands, the art of snaring users with such gimmickry has become, quite literally, a science: Pincus told Time magazine last year that Zynga employs a behavioral psychologist.""<p>I think the absence of something in addition to the compulsion loop is what people are objecting to here.

1678095,comment,1672140,1674914,0,0,andrewacove,,,"Thanks for the comments, Sam.<p>I've been trying to work out the best response to this.  I think that you're correct in that there is a hole to be filled by a QR-to-URL service - essentially a bit.ly for QR codes.  Despite availability of QR codes from existing players (Google being the most significant) and the ready availability of both websites and libraries for producing QR codes from URLs (and any other text), branding will play a big role in making them take off.  ScanLife is certainly a player in this space: <a href=""http://us.scanlife.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.scanlife.com/</a> .  They have QR codes on the Inception movie posters as part of the advertising campaign, as well.  But anyone can do it.  And given that ZXing is an open source scanning library, anyone can build the apps.<p>It may be shortsighted, but that's not the business I want to build.  Scanning a QR code to follow a business is something I actually want - something that came directly out of a need in my own life - and it's the connections themselves that are interesting to me.  QR codes are really only the beginning of what I want Quirk to be - I just think they're a good place to start.<p>That said, you're not the only person to suggest that Quirk should provide a tool for converting URLs to barcodes, even just as a promotion for Quirk itself.  And if that turns into the biggest aspect of Quirk, then so be it.  So, I guess we'll see.<p>Thanks again for your comment - definitely made me think (thus the slow response).",1284100632

These inter-frame data dependencies will make tone-mapping video comparable in complexity to video encoding. It also means that it is unlikely to be a task that can be fully automated, because there is a tradeoff between inter-frame contrast and intra-frame contrast that can only be resolved with knowledge of the artistic intent of the sequence.",1284100295

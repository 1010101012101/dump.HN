Apple predicting what Samsung would have agreed to; that acting reasonable and rationally, Samsung would have agreed to pay to totally crazy sum; or the patents themselves.<p>What can possibly be innovative about tapping a phone number? How is unified search Apple&#x27;s idea and not some actual search giant&#x27;s? What is innovative about data synchronization? Does Apple do it in a particularly clever and innovative way that Samsung copied? And does every single website also owe Apple $8 per visitor for having autocomplete?",1394546351
7379203,comment,7378865,7378933,1,0,zanny,,,"I&#x27;ve always thought of how revolutionary it would be to have some kind of video hosting site where you distributed encrypted content throughout the users in fragments. When you would be using the client it would always be broadcasting to others, but you could enable or disable a background daemon to do it throughout the day. You could have it &quot;smart allocate&quot; the video cache, and it would keep local your favorites and could pull down your &quot;watch later&quot; videos in advance. It could buffer episode 2 when you are watching episode 1, etc.<p>I can&#x27;t think of another way to democratize youtube - the costs of storing and broadcasting petabytes of videos are astronomical, but I think torrenting proves there is a <i>lot</i> of untapped bandwidth in the world you could take advantage of if you mask it over with a nice GUI. I guess that is the real downside of such an idea - it can&#x27;t work in the browser, unless you implement a torrent client in javascript, and even then you couldn&#x27;t maintain a local cache.",1394546348

Because people want to create web applications that are responsive without requiring the client to constantly poll the server to see if there&#x27;s new data, and Node.js does that better than existing tools.<p>Why are NoSQL databases popular now? Because right now, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to scale up by buying more computers than it is to scale up by buying better computers, and current relational databases are bad at scaling up that way (compared to other parts of the stack). Now, I think that NoSQL sometimes throws out the baby with the bathwater, and I do think there are cargo cult NoSQL users who are convinced that if they go around throwing out babies they&#x27;ll eventually get some dirty bathwater. But NoSQL does solve real problems, and (to the point here) those are problems that are really difficult to predict that you&#x27;ll need to solve from 15 years before now, because you need to know how the economics of buying computer hardware will change in the future.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is possible, at this point in the development of these technologies, to future-proof your skills if you want to work on new projects. You can either keep learning the new things, or waiting until other people find out which of the new things are actually going to last and then learn those things. You can use your current skills to maintain legacy systems. Or you can get into something like management, where you can leave specific technical details to other, younger people and focus on broader issues, like relations between your developers and the people they&#x27;re serving.",1394545351

There is something way worse, and harder to cure:<p>You can&#x27;t teach something to someone if their livelihood depends on them not knowing it.<p>For instance, if you start with an departments whose sole job is build software, and they make scrum teams that happen to have 5 people that only know the business, 3 testsrs that don&#x27;t know how to write code, a dba who is the only person who can change DB structures, and 4 developers who do not talk to users, there is NO WAY you can make scrum work without major amounts of turnover. 13 team members is too many for a scrum. Scrum members have to be able to play multiple roles, even if they are only excellent at one of them. Otherwise, the team is not self organizing, and can&#x27;t adapt to much.<p>Most large organizations around town that claim to do scrum follow that pattern, and the end result is that they are doing all the scrum ceremonies, but the teams are lumbering hulks of failure.<p>I agree with the article: Agility is more important than the process, and people have to carry agility with them.

But that doesn&#x27;t change that actual agility is the only way to produce high-quality software efficiently.  And we probably do need people investigating and suggesting how we overcome these barriers; but indeed, the &#x27;agile&#x27; industry has not succeeded in doing so, they mostly take the easier path of figuring out how to cater to these barriers while calling it &#x27;agile&#x27;, instead of how to change organizational culture and surmount them.",1394542884

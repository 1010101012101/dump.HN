5805956,comment,5804798,5804798,16,0,semaphoreblink,,,"I make about $200k as a (mostly) developer, so I can give you a bit of guidance.<p>First, constantly improve throughout your 20s. Learn a new (programming) language, read tech blogs, contribute to open source, etc. This will allow you to sharpen your skills and get into the top X% of the class. Understand operating systems, networking, security, plus higher level stuff (read CIO-focused magazines, technology strategy blogs, etc.) Volunteer for special projects at work whenever possible--these are often worth their weight in gold.<p>Next, specialize. Go deep in one or two areas. Trends today are on mobility and security, but there are plenty of others. Depends on what you're passionate about, but try to get to the point where you're the smartest person you know in that topic.<p>Oh yeah, you have to be passionate about it. You aren't a programmer, you're a creator of things. An artist isn't a ""paintbrush mover"", and you're certainly not a typist. Take it up a level.<p>To be more strategic, get into financial services. A good percentage of developers make close to $200k after bonuses. Watch the firm though, some place like Goldman will have you working 18+ hrs a day.<p>Live in an epicenter (San Francisco, LA, NYC, Seattle, and probably a few others).<p>Ok, most important advice. Change jobs every 3 years. Most developers, no matter how good they are, don't get a 50% raise, but it wouldn't be hard to start around $60k, then jump to $85k, then to $110k, then to $140k. After bonuses at that higher level, you'll be close to $200k.<p>Don't work 80 hr weeks more than a few times a year. Put in the time and the effort when it's needed, but if you make it a habit, it'll become expected. Work for a company where quality  >> # of hours put in.<p>If you're 20, generalize.<p>If you're 25, specialize.<p>If you're 30, take some risks. You'll soon be the ""old guy"" in the room. Write articles, books, talk at conferences, become an ""industry expert"" (hint: fake it till you make it)<p>If you want to do consulting, as opposed to traditional work, you can get to $200k, but you'll probably need to bill out around $120/hr or so. You'll need to specialize in order to get a rate like that, or be available on-site, because whoever hires you would have to think you're better than 4 or 5 people in (insert-outsource-country-of-the-week).<p>Finally, exploit LinkedIn. Get to know a few good recruiters. Get to know people in the industry who are ""going places"". Unfortunately, many of the best jobs out there aren't advertised, you have to know people to get in.<p>That's all I've got. Good luck!",1370119859

This bad URL could then be sent as a link in a spam email or similar. Victims clicking on the link would then see a page that comes from the legitimate source, but is running unsafe code compromising that user's session.

Firstly, salaries in the software industry are mostly determined by market forces rather than actual value generated, because there isn't any driving force, union-based or otherwise, to give individual developers leverage to set rates based on value instead. Secondly, incompetent middle management is a speciality here in the UK, and a lot of the people responsible for hiring software guys wouldn't know a good developer if he single-handedly displaced Google in his spare time. Therefore many businesses that need software wind up hiring poor developers and then complaining about the results.<p>I concluded after a while that the solution to this problem almost always involves founding your own company, even if it's just a vehicle for freelance contracting. That way you are negotiating with clients on a business-to-business basis and typically dealing with senior managers who have a real problem to solve and will pay for the actual value they get if you can solve it for them, bypassing all the PHBs in middle management and their foot soldiers in HR, accounting, legal, etc.",1370119595

I just don't understand what that means. From chatter with recruiters and friends, your best change of getting into a hedge fund is through personal contacts. Can you confirm this theory?",1370119586

They are loosely connected to the economy and aren't as affected by this as people fully involved with the global economy.<p>In a way activities like urban farming and doomsday preppers share a value system we'll see on a rise.  The value system shared between these two activities is being self sufficient and control of your own destiny.

5805827,comment,5805020,5805343,45,0,antr,,,"Your entire statement is false/untrue and lacks intellectual rigour.<p>Let me start by saying that half of my family works in the healthcare sector: my dad is trauma surgeon, my sister is a chemical engineer at a (very) large European pharma company, and my mum works extensively with pharma sales/marketing teams around Europe. I'm no expert, but I tangentially know the industry.<p>i. 6 out of the top 10 pharma companies by revenues are European (Novartis, Roche, GSK, Sanofi, Bayer, Astra Zeneca).<p>ii. Europe accounts for 1/3 of all pharma R&D in the world.<p>So with the above two points in context, let me pull apart your unsubstantiated comment:<p>First, lets talk about pharma and drugs for a second.<p><i>>make little to no margnial profit in non-US markets</i><p>European pharma co. Novartis made in 2012 revenues of $19.7bn in Europe vs $18.6bn in the US (and a total of $56.7bn). Novartis invested 21% of sales into R&D.<p>U.S. pharma company Pfeizer, total revenues of $59bn in 2012, U.S. was $27bn and international $36bn. Pfeizer invested $7.9bn in R&D (c. 13% of revenues).<p>Look at any other large US or European company and you will see that Europe is as profitable, if not more, than the U.S. Europe, by itself, on a total revenue minus total R&D expenditure, is (in the $ billions) profitable.<p><i>>pressures of a single-payer system driving down prices as low as they can possibly go.</i><p>No European country has a single-payer, that is false. Purchasing is not made by a country, and it is not even done at the regional level. Purchasing decisions are made at a hospital per hospital level. Each hospital manages its own budget and pretty much pay market rates (to check this simply go to the pharma companies annual reports and do the math).<p><i>>This means that pharmaceutical companies have to recoup their fixed costs (R&D) and generate their real profits from the US market.</i><p>So given the math above, and given that R&D is a fixed investment (even if the final compound is produced ad infinitum), the U.S. tends to contribute to 25% to 35% of any pharma companies' revenues, while the rest of the world makes up the rest. This simply means that the U.S. by itself would cover R&D, but in no way it could cover for R&D + operational costs.<p><i>>Without the US market, there would be no incentive to actually create the drugs.</i><p>European pharma, by itself, makes over 1/3 of all world R&D in pharma, while U.S. contributes 1/3 of all revenues. Without the rest of the world, U.S. companies would not invest at all.<p>Second, lets talk ER and other primary patient care with no drugs involved.<p>How is it that any transplant, operation, etc. in any part of the world is cheaper, face value wise, in RoW than in the US?<p>Well, let me say that while in Europe healthcare is considered important, it is not seen as a business, but a basic right. Not the right to FREE healthcare, but the right to healthcare. Healthcare in EU countries is seen as the recurring cost of keeping the citizens healthy, and hence healthcare is managed as a cost centre and not a profit centre. E.g. Doctors and nurses, across the same EU country get paid very consistent salaries, unlike the US, where a surgeon in Orlando makes a completely different salary than one in Idaho, or even in the same city! Salaries of public employees in the EU are transparent and consistent. The overall U.S. healthcare system lacks price transparency at every level. How can it be that the same surgical procedure in the same U.S. city varies in price by 2x or 3x? In the U.S., hospitals, large healthcare companies and other parties are there to make a profit, not to run a business at a loss. They have shareholders, it's understandable. In Europe, the shareholder is the citizen, and healthcare is not a for-profit business. Nevertheless, if you want more ""customer service"" in your European healthcare you can have it, pay for private insurance, but pay for it, it's not illegal.<p>My final comment would be this insightful chart: <a href=""https://www.e-education.psu.edu/drupal6/files/geog438w/images/module5/LifeExpectancy.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.e-education.psu.edu/drupal6/files/geog438w/image...</a>",1370118444

So the effective mass (mass * ) of an ""electron"" inside a crystal is different from the mass of a free electron in vacuum. The mass can even be negative! It's easy to understand this negative mass using an algebraic trick and describing this object as a particle called ""hole"" with a positive effective mass and a positive charge.<p>Another example is the perturbations of the crystalline lattice (the movements of the atoms that compose the crystal), they are called ""phonons"" and in a lot of ways they behave like real particles. For example the correct method to understand conductivity at small temperature is to analyze how the ""phonons"" can ""bounce"" against the ""electrons"" and ""holes"".<p>So, the result in this article could be useful to test what could happen if we even find a real monopole, but it's not a real monopole and it gives no cue about a possible method to create a real monopole.<p>Another article that describes a similar effect, but it's more clear about the difference between a real monopole and the result of their experiment: ""Point-like defects in a quantum fluid behave like magnetic monopoles"" : <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2012-09-point-like-defects-quantum-fluid-magnetic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2012-09-point-like-defects-quantum-flui...</a>",1370117038

Our customers <i>love</i> our product, because we work extremely hard on to improve and protect the user experience, design, and overall coherence of the product.<p>Current goals and challenges include building new features, improving our automated testing, and maintaining a solid foundation for the product.  Your workload in a given month might include bugs, a feature or two to build by yourself or with a few others, improving our technology stack, or implementing your own ideas to improve the product.  We like people who are full stack, and like learning about all areas of the product.<p>I am a full-stack dev, so I do everything from tuning database queries to Rails to JavaScript to visual design on my features, its pretty damn rewarding and interesting.<p>Working on the product development team is pretty great.  I enjoy working and spending time with everyone on the team, and we have smart people from lots of different backgrounds and locations.  We have a neat office space in downtown San Mateo that is open and perfect for a team of programmers (we keep the noise down when we're working).  We are two blocks from the San Mateo CalTrain station, we have plenty of room for bikes, and free parking passes if you want to drive.<p>We have had remote developers for a long time, across the country and world.  We also allow for working from home as needed for local people (or wherever else you are productive), and tend to <i>strongly encourage</i> people to go home and rest if they look tired or don't feel well.<p>We offer good pay, great health / dental / vision insurance, unlimited vacation, extremely flexible hours (pretty much be in by 11am if you are local).  We have ""field trip"" lunches on Wednesdays to get the team together and relax, and other days we might walk to the park or somewhere downtown for lunch.<p>Please email a quick intro and your resume, website, or github to <i></i>* brianfarr@gmail.com <i></i>*  if you are interested or have any questions.<p>If you seem like a good possibility, your resume <i>will</i> be seen by my manager and the team this Monday.  If not, I will try my best to point you to someplace you are a good fit, or connect you with recruiters I know.  Also, if you are new or looking to move to the SF Bay Area and want to talk to someone who did it last year, from the midwest, send me an email too.",1370116847

Also, the reason consulting rates are not high is not b/c of the benefits (that makes at most 20% of the diff between consulting and full time rates). The difference is uncertainty!  If you freelance, you have no idea where your next gig will come from. If you are long term contractor, you are 1 step away from being the first cut in the budget",1370116835

This didn&#x27;t completely stop them from falling over, but usually the top of the pallet&#x27;s contents would become partially dislodged, which was a minor annoyance at best.  It usually took a team of two a half hour to offload about 30 pallets of grocery items off of a truck and load up bales of cardboard for recycling, and about 5 hours to break down the pallets and stock the store.<p>Part of Target&#x27;s madness might be in the extremely different kinds of merchandise they&#x27;re selling, but most of those products are small, and Winn-Dixie solved the problem by sending these products in plastic totes.",1401155824

There are ways to work around this, though.<p>The bigger problem to me is interpretability.  Deep learning often gives feature sets that are very good for whatever task you are working on, they are in some senses artificial and it is difficult to relate changes in features to changes in the input data.  I work with a lot of biological and medical data, and this is an issue because for some applications it is important not to just get accurate classification results, but to be able to understand what your features mean in the context of the original problem.  I saw some interesting work in a computer vision paper earlier this year on trying to learn how to visualize how changes in input and outputs of a neural net were related, I&#x27;ll try to dig that up later if anyone is interested.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how coherent that was as I was trying to get this typed out in a hurry.",1401154257

IP exists to legally protect a competitive advantage in the marketplace, making it indispensable to anyone in the marketplace.  every capitalist is incentivized to act in defense of current IP laws, because their continued success in the marketplace is based on their control of IP.  considering the people defending IP policy are largely the ones controlling the lion&#x27;s share of capital, they correspondingly have a much greater amount of power to dictate IP policy in every arena, from the legal to the legislative.<p>this is an intractable problem.  information is just an abstract form of capital.  at the heart of it, success in capitalism is about consolidating as much capital as you can.  it follows that information will be consolidated as much as possible, and this problem will only get worse as time goes on.<p>since we all need money to fulfill our basic and higher-level needs, our economic systems directly drive our collective behavior.  since capitalism is based on competition, this means our collective behavior is always going to be driven towards individualism.  as we have seen, when we have problems that require behaviors not incentivized by the economy, such as cooperation - climate change, biodiversity, etc - we instantly hit a brick wall and find that cooperation is impossible.  we see companies continuing to steamroll ahead with oil drilling and such in the face of huge disasters, not because anyone is evil, but because <i>everyone is doing their job</i>.<p>i don&#x27;t know what the solution is, and i am not advocating any other economic paradigm over capitalism.  but i think we need to take several steps back and ask ourselves if our best heuristic for determining the behavior of human societies is: &quot;move capital around as efficiently as possible.&quot;  and i&#x27;m not even touching the fact that laissez-faire capitalism optimizes for inequality.<p>chicago and austrian school commenters: come at me, bro.",1401152994

The number of rediculous assertions I&#x27;ve seen which are patently (heh) false is astounding. A recent example was a patent awarded to Amazon; the media reporting would have you think they got a patent for taking a photo of something in front of a white background. While that does form part of the claims, the actual details are extremely narrow, and the patent is almost worthless to Amazon.<p>Then there&#x27;s the frequently brought up &quot;Apple got a patent for rounded corners on a phone! The patent system has gone MAD!&quot;. This was a design patent, intended to stop others making phones that look like Apple&#x27;s (both other big players like Samsung and HTC as well as Chinese knockoff manufacturers). Design patents are very different from standard patents; they&#x27;re closer to copyright for physical things than patents.<p>These are just examples of the tip of the iceburg of ignorance I see every day when people discuss the patent system.<p>As for lots of &quot;low-quality patents&quot;, I disagree that is actually true. It&#x27;s just the bad ones that get reported on most frequently and loudly; it&#x27;s the reason more people are scared of flying even though they have a much higher chance of dying on the car trip to the airport. The USPTO and other patent offices around the world are very good at rejecting things which don&#x27;t (legally) deserve a patent. Generaly examiners are quite familliar with the state of the art of the technologies they examine and know when something is well known or an obvious improvement over the prior art. Sometimes they have to allow something that seems obvious because they have no legal grounds to reject it.",1401152746

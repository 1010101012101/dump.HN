We have just started to build our engineering team focusing on growth, marketing and business development efforts in our San Francisco office (product development is in our other office in Budapest, Hungary with about 40 engineers).<p>Some exciting tasks ahead: build quick prototypes that drive growth; high performance web development (both from a backend and frontend perspective); backend systems for marketing campaigns (and their respective frontend work of course); content management system on our main website; integration with 3rd party providers (e.g. Salesforce).<p>About our technology stack: we primarily use Python/Django in the backend, but we also have Scala and Haskell in production. Frontend is LESS (built on top of Bootstrap), and JavaScript (jQuery) with some CoffeeScript.<p>Why Prezi? We are a profitable (but also well-funded) company that's been around for more than 4 years now, with more than 18 million registered users. We have 100 employees, but the SF office is still pretty small (20 people). We don't track holidays, benefits include health, dental and vision. You get to travel to Budapest, Hungary at least twice a year, a city well-known for its baths and ruin pubs.

Unlike most consumer goods, books are returnable to the publishers for a full refund if not sold which has been the glue keeping publishers and booksellers workign together since the 1930's.<p>Publishers were tied to their partners and couldn't walk away from them to go after new opportunities.

4993712,comment,4981962,4984532,1,0,geofft,,,"Secure Boot does not implement DRM or help in any way for DRM, as it turns out. Secure Boot is about the hardware trusting the OS it's about to boot, not about the OS trusting the hardware it's running on. Once the OS has booted, it has no way to figure out if the ""you were secure-booted"" flag is trustworthy or not -- a trojan bootloader can easily set that flag and then chainload to the normal OS.<p>If you want the OS to trust the hardware it's on, you need a TPM, and you probably need the machine to be installed by someone who can communicate with the content provider. The entire point of Secure Boot is that it can be implemented just in existing UEFI code, _without_ the additional hardware of a TPM.<p>I develop an OS product that has no browser installed on it at all -- there's one small client application that just interacts with our one server product, and then boots everything else you might want to do in a VM. The biggest threat to the security of our outer layer is, in fact, an evil maid attack. It's certainly worth being aware of that threat, even if there are other, bigger threats.

Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into ""layers"", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.<p>I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.<p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)<p>See mokafive.com for more info, or send me an email (gthomas at that domain name).",1357069771

We just need more ideas, and to make sure that our existing operating systems are modular enough to allow them to fit into the picture.<p>Trying to recreate an entire operating system from scratch is almost universally doomed, even when the end result is something ""better"" -- Plan9, BeOS, take your pick. Doomed. Because if it's too great a departure from existing platforms all at once then after you're done reinventing the wheel somebody has to go out and build all new roads before you can actually deploy it at scale. All the apps people expect have to be ported (and who is going to port them to an OS nobody uses because it has no apps?), all the drivers for all the different hardware have to be written (and who is going to write them for an OS nobody uses because it has no drivers?), on and on.<p>Which doesn't mean they aren't useful as research projects rather than operating systems: You build something that works on one hardware platform and has no apps, but does something cool, and now you've got a proof of concept and the operating system(s) people actually use can adopt it. And then after they do, the research project OS fully dies because it no longer offers anything novel and it still has no apps and no drivers and no developer community hunting bugs and so forth.<p>The thing we need is an operating system modular enough to allow the implementation of new ideas. Which we pretty much have; and if you can identify an exception, kindly do your part and submit a patch.<p>Most people don't need a versioning file system, but if you do, they're available. And if you don't like the existing ones then you can write your own and plug it in without having to write your own SATA controller drivers. The list of features in Plan9 is basically a TODO list for the Linux community with a good chunk of the boxes already checked.<p>Evolution beats revolution better than 99 times out of 100. All competition is simultaneously healthy/necessary and a wasteful duplication of effort. Having the competition occur at a lower level of granularity reduces the reduplication. Once you get one piece right, that piece can stay as long as it fits while you keep iterating on everything else, without having to reinvent and reimplement all the things that already work.<p>Saying ""we need many more operating systems"" is like saying ""we need many more mutually incompatible version of Internet Protocol"" -- even if you can point out a hundred reasons why IPv4 and IPv6 are both terrible, you're still wrong. There are areas where it's better to work collectively toward getting it right the first time (or at least, getting it right the second or third time instead of the thousandth time), because incompatibility and wasted reduplication are not without cost.",1357069220

Believe me, I know--I run a web site for writers!  ""Piracy"" is the giant slobbering boogeyman that everyone can blame their problems on, but that doesn't really exist.<p>Personally I never buy ebooks for three reasons:<p>1. DRM.  I've bought a handful of DRM'd ebooks in my life and I never will again, not even for a penny.  DRM is crime against freedom of information and consumer rights.<p>2. The quality of many ebooks is just atrocious.  Any ebook version of a book written before, say, 2000 is guaranteed to be riddled with typos and errors so bad as to be unreadable.  And publishers still ask north of $10 for such an ebook.  They OCR a dog-eared paperback from the CEO's personal library, don't bother to proofread it, and slap it on Amazon for $10 and pray for the money to roll in.  Such practices are disgusting to a bibliophile like me and I refuse to support that.<p>3. Price.

It's happening here, and it's not unforgivable since most operating systems package both together. That's actually half the reason Richard Stallman wants you to say GNU/Linux, the technical correctness of the name (the other half is what makes that annoying).<p>What adventures like Debian on FreeBSD (kFreeBSD) and even Android teach us, though, is that you can take a great kernel with its sweeping hardware support and build something better on top of it. The hardware work has been done for you. Apple could have <i>easily</i> built OS X and Darwin on top of Linux-the-kernel instead of Mach (what an interesting world that would be), but they had a limited range of hardware to target and the resources at their disposal to tailor Mach to their known hardware targets.<p>The kernel for the Intel architecture is, I think, at this point mostly figured out. Microkernel had its shot and on Intel we have seen that it's too slow (even though it makes more sense on paper). Linux is pretty darned good, and I think any attempt to be better will, after a few years, end up looking like Linux from several years ago. The Intel architecture has been stable for a long time, and a lot of clever minds have come up with ways to squeeze every drop out of the machine in Linux.<p>When people say ""I want a new operating system!"" I'm not hearing them desire a complete kernel rewrite; that's doomed to fail for a plethora of reasons including hardware drivers. I'm hearing them desire a new userspace and GUI. Make something like OS X based on Linux and I'd spend $500+ to buy it and fund its development.",1357067667

Even if the card only has 8 million unique locations? The contract doesn't say that the card has to hold 128M unique things all at the same time, it just says that you can address 128M things in it. So we take our clever software give you 128M addressable locations but if you try to put more than 8M things in the card you'll erase one of the other things you put in there.<p>You go through a process where you ask a number of vendors for a product that you've specified, perhaps you pick the cheapest one, and it turns out that they have an interpretation of the contract that isn't the same as you. (so they sold you an 8MB flash which pretends to be 128M flash). Your next step is to get them to 'fix' it, and they will, they will say ""Oh we didn't realize you wanted to store 128M different things at once, we can do that too! That will by $Y"" except that $Y is anywhere from 2% to 15% higher than the second or third lowest bid you got earlier.<p>So this manufacturer will tell you with a completely straight face about how sorry they were for mistaking what you wanted, and how its perfectly reasonable that some people really only need about 8MB of unique things, but since you have a relationship with these folks now you get to the 'real' product you wanted (128M flash) and you end up paying more for that than you would have with a different vendor at the start. They have 'won' this round, you have lost.<p>If you know this is how the game is played you write your contracts differently, you write : ""128M Flash, which can hold 128M unique pieces of information at the same time that can be read back at a minimum of x bits per second and written at a minimum of Y bits per second, and can be re-written at least Z times at all temperatures between 0 and 50 degrees C and in the presense or absence of any magnetic field up to x Gauss, to be measured using the following tests on the following equipment that will be supplied by me and cannot be changed by the manufacturer, and will be inspected every 30 days by an agent I appoint who does not work for the vendor.""<p>And then they know you've played the game before.",1357067399

The media and community lionize successful startup founders, and I remember hearing once about the guy who invented the little highway reflectors you see embedded in the California roads (his family gets a royalty for every single one...)<p>[1] ""My Coffeehouse Nightmare"", <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2132576/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2132576/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3029771"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3029771</a>",1357067232

The government is not just the political elite, rather its the civil service as well and that is who the majority of people deal with on a daily basis. If there isn't sufficient ministerial direction or aren't adequate agency policies in place and very importantly those policies are enforced, then the lower ranks of police (and other civil servants) will largely do as they please. This is why corruption, collusion and incompetence are so very tough to remove from much of India's civil service and society.",1357067168

Each person has 3 minutes to talk. Like most standups, we talk about what we've done and what we're doing next. The thing that we do which I don't know that any other startups do, is that as part of that 3 minutes we also share a daily improvement. Something we're working on to improve ourselves. It can be related to Buffer, but usually it isn't. Some examples of improvements people have worked on: start blogging every 2 weeks, speak at first event, speak to a new person every day, learn japanese, wake up an hour earlier. We all encourage each other with our improvements, and this helps us push forward much faster than otherwise. It's a really positive environment and there is built in accountability.",1357066982

""Well I love you but it's probably a mistake because I'm probably a mess myself so let's just walk away from it?""<p>It is OK to size up a potential relationship and make a practical decision about  pursuing it before you actually fall in love with someone.<p>For most people, starting a relationship with a severe schizophrenic is a bad idea. You're letting yourself in for a lot of suffering and very likely you'll further injure your loved one when you eventually leave because you can't take it any more.<p>I think part of growing up is recognizing that not every person you feel attracted to is actually a good person for you to be involved with. Letting feelings of attraction trump one's better judgement causes a awful lot of misery in the world (usually in much less dramatic but much more common scenarios).<p>I'm speaking of the general case here. As you say, sometimes seemingly reckless relationships do work out.

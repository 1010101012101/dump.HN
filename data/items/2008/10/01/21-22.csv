There's good stuff out there, but it's just not yet commercially viable. But the technology is there.<p>I ran Windows XP for years on a 400mhz PC just fine. Mobile processors may be slow, but they are fine for the uses that they will be used for in the near future - email, chat, social networking and the iPhonesque games. Also, one can switch between dedicated simpler processors to more complex processors if battery life were an issue.<p>Technologically, I see very little problems with the concept. The problem lies more with distribution, acceptance and all the business interests whom it does not favor to have this out there.<p>Growth will come in that people will choose to purchase mobile devices that double as a laptop, instead of purchasing a new laptop. So you are right in that it won't bring in new people, it will just cause a movement from one device to the other.",1222898194

Its so good that none of the carriers can duplicate it.<p>These applications drive carrier revenue by encouraging data usage, mobile payment usage(in a future form), 'location usage', etc.<p>Google realizes people are not clicking on ads (as much as when 'browsing' on a PC).  So they do two things, charge the carriers to offer their services(take a share of mobile payments they generate, data usage, etc.) and charge businesses to get their ads in front of people on mobiles, perhaps on a non CPM basis.<p>Is this 'growth'?  Yes.  Its very possible people will 'search' (to use the term very loosely) for different things from their mobile than they do on the web.  Fast food coupons, vs. straight info.  And its also very possible that 'searching' wont be typing into a search-box, but instead some type of flow based suggestion mechanism.",1222897908

But a lot of Flash apps made for WIMP won't run smoothly or, in many ceases, at all on the iPhone.<p><pre><code>  ""All multi-touch does in Safari is zoom!""\n</code></pre>\nNothing is perfect, but the iPhone, unlike any other mobile on the planet, does in fact have a coherent user experience. And the basis of that is multi-touch, not just in Safari but everywhere on the phone. This isn't some Linux distro where all apps have their own UX paradigm. You can't expect iPhone users to switch UI paradigms when they encounter Flash apps just because Flash can't handle multi-touch or because its WIMP conventions conflict with the iPhone's. (The vast majority of Flash apps/sites are predicated upon mouse rollover, for example, that doesn't work on the iPhone.)<p>This is a movie we've seen before. You could give the same example with friends sending you links for stuff buried in  Active X containers in IE that no other non-Windows browser could properly render. What happened? MS has gradually abandoned Active X, and much of what Active X could do can now be done via non-proprietary browser technologies. The scenario won't be so different for Flash. Nothing will be black and white, but that's the trend.",1222896807

321153,comment,320646,320646,0,0,Hexstream,,,"My personal highlight:<p>""<i>It had a novel event-handling system capable of supporting arbitrary user-defined events. The event system identified events by pattern-matching.<p>Q: What kind of high-level events would that be? Could the user define those?<p>Mikel: Yes. The idea was that you could plug a sequence of lower-level events together and use a property sheet to perhaps parameterize them, thus creating a novel kind of event. Sort of like constructing AppleScripts by recording UI actions, but in smaller, easier to understand and easier to debug pieces. (One of the things I wrote for the automated testing system was an application that watched what the user did and constructed a representation of the observed actions that could be replayed on another system; it represented actions not in terms of low-level MacOS events, but in terms of abstract state transitions described in terms of frames that represented application features, so that moving to a different machine with different screen layout and so forth would not break the playback. Some of the ideas for the event system came from combining that experience with the experience of Jim Grandy, who actually wrote the event system, and who had earlier worked on Garnet.)</i>""<p>The future of OSes, folks!... and of applications too I'd say.

321152,comment,320830,321113,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"The first thing FriendFeed lacks is a profile of the user. If I use my Friendfeed account as a link for someone to find out about me (ie in an email footer), then having some profile information alongside my feeds makes sense. This is more of a Facebook profile feature I'm thinking inserted into a FriendFeed-like 'base' site.<p>Also, FriendFeed lacks distinction between Friends and Subscribers, currently there are only subscribers. A person's life also consists of events they are going to, places they are or have been employed, and place they've travelled to. Each of these would be represented.<p>Furthermore, as a webmaster, I'd like to login and see what on-site comments have been made about pages on my site and by whom.<p>There should be a toolbar, allowing me to like/digg/approve any page I come across and then comment on it. Those comments can be accessed back on the site, in a sidebar like socialbrowse, or 'pulled-into' any site that wants them. In the sidebar, I should also see where else on the web discussion for any page is occurring. Also, I should be able to see what pages my friends are on at any time, and there should be a toggle to turn off the broadcast of my browsing behaviour to stay 'under the radar.' There should be chat too, either with friends or people on the same page. Also, an author or content creator profile should be seen in the toolbar of any page so a webmaster or author can claim their site or page.<p>A business can create a profile page and then keep it updated with the latest news, product offerings, events, press releases and fundings associated with it for stakeholders to follow.<p>The new site should allow 'Tweet'-like updates, and also presence updates of where someone is located and friends and news occurring in that physical zone.<p>There's no reason the aforementioned sites (twitter, facebook, socialbrowse etc.) can't be integrated to some extent (especially Friendfeed), but ideally this site would be standalone and a replacement. It may in fact copy text and content straight off qualifying external sites for redisplay, like imgfave does for photos. That way, it can start to track authors I like, and I can then view articles on-site without logos and ads as seen on the source site.<p>News for example can be submitted on-site and attached to a company or individual or, it can be aggregated from elsewhere like on Friendfeed. Expanding overall submission capabilities would be a goal. It can also implement the OpenSocial SPI.<p>Information is semantically marked-up and searchable.",1222895456

321150,comment,320601,321125,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, I see the rampant complaints about the iPhone 3G's battery life, and the relatively slow improvement in batteries overall. It's going to take a tremendous leap for a phone to match my laptop's dual core processor, and have a graphics card that can power an external display, while getting battery life that's tolerable to most people. You really think it's almost there?<p>I'm definitely not privy to any research labs, but I've seen nothing in the past, or in current literature, to make me optimistic about that big of a leap. Laptops still lag significantly behind desktops in general, especially at the same price point. Why should phones not lag even further?<p>Also, even if what you say is true, and they swap laptops for phones, that's not growth, it's just a shift. If they still use the phone primarily docked, where they would previously have used a PC, and only 10% of the time mobile, then it's only 10% growth from Google's perspective.",1222895297

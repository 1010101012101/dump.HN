As I got older I made a rule never to start a new project until the old project is finished.<p>As I&#x27;ve switched, I&#x27;ve noticed the motivations have changed.  The last 20% of any project is un-fun work.  All the excitement is gone and all that is left is tedium.  This is when your eyes start wandering to other projects.<p>It&#x27;s addiction.  You are addicted to the fun part, and when it&#x27;s no longer fun you start looking for you fix somewhere else.  The trick is to change your addiction.  Force yourself to finish a project.  Get addicted to the sense of accomplishment instead of being addicted to learning something new and exciting.  If you only care about the learning and not the doing, you&#x27;ll end up reading wikipedia all day, every day.",1423925870

9049772,comment,9049208,9049208,0,0,UserRights,,,"Problem: Information Overload. \nSolution (immediate): Cut input. \nSolution (long term): Stop wasting time with BS.<p>Do NOT start to read books / weblogs to solve &quot;productivity problems&quot;. \nBiggest bullshit you could do right now. This will only increase your overload. Not all of these books are bad, but read them later, it will not help you right now. Instead do this:<p>YOUR MISSION (ONE WEEK SPECIAL OPS):<p>-> STOP USING THE COMPUTER FOR ONE WEEK - START RIGHT NOW.<p>No exception. Be absolutely strict about it. It is only one week - it might change your life, so no exception, not one single minute. Send emails now about being offline for one week to most important people. CLOSE ALL BROWSER TABS before shutting down the computer and then put your computer into a wardrobe or in a place you can not see it. Hide it.<p>-> Calm down your neurons.<p>Sleep a lot. DO NOT WATCH TV. Do not read any books. Eat very good, this means healthy, not much. Eat lots of vitamines, fruits, salad, etc., no toxic waste like meat from industrial production (too many hormons and medics), no sugar, no alcohol, no drugs. Spend much time with things that let you feel physically good, e.g. taking a bath, massage, sports, etc. Go outside, walk, move your body, WASTE TIME sitting on some sunny place doing nothing. Do some meditation or just sit down and try not to control your brain, just let your ideas flow like clouds in the sky.<p>-> you will feel better after two days, but DO NOT TOUCH THE COMPUTER AND DO NOT WATCH TV. Do not read books. Go on with relaxing and feeling good. If you start feeling an urge to &quot;do something&quot;, go out and move your body or ask your girlfriend what she would like to do.<p>-> After the week passed, you will realize that you are still alive and that you did not miss anything. You do not need a computer to have a good life. Interesting experience, try it yourself.<p>-> Now write down what you want to achieve the next week and what exact task you want to accomplish, just a few words are ok, but this will be your plan for the week and you must follow it strictly. Before startig the computer again, write down what exact task you want to solve with it.<p>-> Stop using the internet like a news paper or a tv show. Stop visiting this site. Stop using any social networks, twitter, reddit, imgur, whatever. Only do things you need for accomplishing your task.<p>->  Start using the internet as a place where you can look up things, when you hit a wall and need some specific information.<p>-> Still stop watching TV. It will help a lot. From time to time download some interesting movie or documentary, but absolutely avoid being radiated with an non-controllable unidirectional information stream.<p>You are now in a special condition and there is much more to explore about this state of mind, but you have to control your input very strictly. Be aware of the dangers and you will succeed. Good Luck!",1423925785

You can choose wrong and restart, but you need to go deep on something to get the level of knowledge and experience that will then help you more quickly dive deep on the next thing.<p>As far as that algorithms lecture, it&#x27;s a case study in learning with a purpose. As an adult, learning something which can then be applied or wrestled with immediately is how you pull value from that lecture. What did you do to reinforce your consumption of the lecture within 72 hours of the lecture? What did you do over the next 12 months?<p>My general advice would be: \n1. Identify something you would want to work on even if it wasn&#x27;t from an engineering standpoint (something that offers the side effect of desire/motivation/focus)<p>2. Discover your strengths and weaknesses in getting things done by wrestling with understanding the problem and practicing solutions<p>3. Learn with a purpose in order to build your skills and experience in analysis, design, and implementation of a solution<p>4. Reflect on what worked or didn&#x27;t work in steps 1-2-3 for you since everybody is different.<p>You may learn differently.

At which point the entire team is in constant crunch mode and getting tired. This causes even more defects, which cause even worse estimates...<p>One project I worked on last year saw four different authentication systems implemented.

9049759,comment,9049186,9049679,0,0,engendered,,,"<i>thereby leaving an inconsistent, incoherent spaghetti mess behind them</i><p>Generally my experience has been that the inconsistent, incoherent mess develops when people tasked with doing trivial changes try to &quot;fix technical debt&quot; in the process, leaving you partly on the way to a &quot;better&quot; model, at least until the next guy comes along. And then the next guy. Until you have a layer cake of different approaches and technologies and philosophies, degrading to a worse and worse state.<p>Look, I&#x27;ve been doing this for 20 years. Almost everything I work on tends to be novel code. I&#x27;m <i>terrible</i> at estimating, and now refuse to do it at all. But there is a lot of self-serving, well, nonsense that we ply in this field, justifying our failures (and the reality that most developers don&#x27;t want to learn other people&#x27;s code, so they just short circuit the whole thing and pretend it&#x27;s higher ground), and the whole &quot;technical debt&quot; thing is one of the most egregious. Most developers, when asked to do something to existing code, will throw their hands up and declare it the worst code they&#x27;ve ever worked with, and they can&#x27;t possibly make some trivial change without completely rewriting all of it, etc (usually somehow pulling in whatever the pet technology of the month is...sorry, I can&#x27;t change the web form without turning it into a single-page app built on io.js and React and...). We all tell each other this on boards that we dominate, not realizing how completely ridiculous and transparent it really is. It&#x27;s always more fun to build something novel than to just modify things that exist.<p>Which is why I really think maintenance programmers are a unique and <i>valuable</i> breed for businesses to have. I personally have a weakness that I always need to rebuild things. I&#x27;m terrible as a maintenance programmer, so I simply don&#x27;t do it. But there are some people who are perfectly happy adapting to whatever they are working on, learning its idioms and unique traits, and then competently and quickly making necessary changes without drama and theatrics about how dire of a situation they&#x27;ve been put in.<p>To abuse the analogies that have been plied, it&#x27;s being asked to drive somewhere, and first re-building the car into an electric car, then a self-driving car, and then deciding that you want it to be a hyperloop, and then talking about relativity, all while the business just wanted to get from A to B.",1423925522

Under governments wherein the will of every one has a just influence, as is the case in England in a slight degree, and in our states in a great one. 3. Under governments of force: as is the case in all other monarchies and in most of the other republics. To have an idea of the curse of existence under these last, they must be seen. It is a government of wolves over sheep. It is a problem, not clear in my mind, that the 1st. condition is not the best. But I believe it to be inconsistent with any great degree of population. The second state has a great deal of good in it. The mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious degree of liberty and happiness. It has it’s evils too: the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject. But weigh this against the oppressions of monarchy, and it becomes nothing. Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem. Even this evil is productive of good. It prevents the degeneracy of government, and nourishes a general attention to the public affairs.

Four times in the course of those last weeks he mailed himself source code he was working on. (He’d later be accused of sending himself 32 megabytes of code, but what he sent was essentially the same 8 megabytes of code four times over.) The files contained a lot of open-source code he had worked with, and modified, over the past two years, mingled together with code that wasn’t open source but proprietary to Goldman Sachs. As he would later try and fail to explain to an F.B.I. agent, he hoped to disentangle the one from the other, in case he needed to remind himself how he had done what he had done with the open-source code, in the event he might need to do it again. He sent these files the same way he had sent himself files nearly every week, since his first month on the job at Goldman. “No one had ever said a word to me about it,” he says. He pulled up his browser and typed into it the words: Free Subversion Repository. Up popped a list of places that stored code, for free, and in a convenient fashion. He clicked the first link on the list. The entire process took about eight seconds. And then he did what he had always done since he first started programming computers: he deleted his bash history. To access the computer he was required to type his password. If he didn’t delete his bash history, his password would be there to see, for anyone who had access to the system.&quot;</i>",1423924124

You can take a look at a piece Peter Drucker (the &quot;Father of Management&quot;) wrote, for the Harvard Business Review, titled &quot;Managing Oneself&quot;. Here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nWe all have a vast number of areas in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becoming even mediocre. In those areas a person - and especially a knowledge worker- should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence. It takes far more energy and work to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance to excellence. And yet most people - especially most teachers and most organizations - concentrate on making incompetent performers into mediocre ones. Energy, resources, and time should go instead to making a competent person into a star performer.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>You can also take a look at David Allen&#x27;s &quot;Getting Things Done&quot;.<p>I found that the problems you are talking about, for me, have stemmed from poor time management. I didn&#x27;t know where time went, and I would do/study something, neglecting another thing and then recalling that it&#x27;s been ages I haven&#x27;t looked at the darn thing and completely forgot it. So...<p>So it&#x27;s not visiting something for a while that screws things up. I needed to make sure that I visit everything at least once a week and make it constant. Not ignore it for a year and then try to get back to it.<p>Naturally, you can&#x27;t do everything daily..<p>I studied Electronics Engineering and I graduated few months ago. I organize my time (think &quot;Country/State budget&quot;, finite) into 4 axes(think &quot;Departments&quot;). I assume it&#x27;s a 16 hour waking time. Each &quot;Department&quot; gets a specific &quot;budget/time&quot;<p>Axes/Departments: Engineering (9 hours), Business (3hours), Lifestyle (2hours), Culture(2h).<p>These are the core of who I am/want to be.<p>- Engineering:<p>* Reservoir Engineering/Characterisation (General + specific: NMR, sonic, induction logging, etc).<p>* Electronics Engineering.<p>* Physics (Landau & Lifschitz, Feynman Lectures, Atomic/Nuclear).<p>* Mathematics (Old college courses : Piskounov, Demidovich. New ones: Kolmogorov).<p>* Brush up my rational mechanics (well, basically stuff we did in college in the engineering course).<p>* Signal Processing (Oppenheim, etc).<p>* Programming: (Python, currently building an application). C (for microcontrollers and much more). Erlang (because I want to). In addition to the stuff I&#x27;m using.\n* \n- Lifestyle: Fitness, time with family and friends: Because I found out I was neglecting my loved ones in my quest.<p>- Culture/Self improvement:<p>* Short term goal: Fluent in the 6 official U.N languages (3 down, 1 on in progress). Then German.<p>* Learning how to draw and paint, learn to read music and play guitar.<p>* Literature (raised with French literature classics, touched a bit of Russian, keeping that going).<p>* Raised in the military, so I&#x27;m interested in weaponery and intelligence.<p>- Business:<p>* Economics 101.\n* Management.\n* Business.<p>I divide each day in 16 slots, I have a spreadsheet with colored blocks(each &quot;axis/department&quot; has a color)  and make sure I touch everyone of those aspects multiple times a week.<p>So I may skip today&#x27;s session of something, but I make it up the next day.<p>Many of these may not &quot;bring&quot; something or advance my &quot;career&quot;, but the scope of all of this is a lifetime.

Douglas Rushkoff documents this recent phenomenon very well. His book Present Shock articulates the problem / dilemma really well. Worth a read - if you haven&#x27;t already added it to your Amazon wishlist and is not another book in your digital bucket list.<p>My personal solution was to let go. Tech and computers are now the apex predator. Just swim in the ocean, don&#x27;t resist it. In terms of your path - who am I to judge? I dropped out of a C.S course because tech was moving too fast and the course material was out of sync with how fast tech was moving. Enjoy tech on your own terms.<p>Note: &#x27;Letting go&#x27; also has the paradoxical effect of getting more done with tech. When you get out of your own way, tech works for you, rather than against you. I learned this from the raw data. It&#x27;s up to you to experience this for yourself.",1423922631

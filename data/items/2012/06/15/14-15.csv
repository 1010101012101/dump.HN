4116819,comment,4115700,4115700,3,0,vonmoltke,,,"""I've come across many employers complaining that recruiters have actually copied their job postings word for word despite not engaging said recruiters to represent them.""<p>I have been hit by this, and I believe I may have lost one or two opportunities because of this.  My first hint of this practice was during a phone interview when the hiring manager said something to the effect of, ""your recruiter will get in contact with you"".  Not  ""our recruiter"", not $NAME.  I got the distinct impression that I had been put in front of this company unsolicited.<p>From then on I started Googling for reqs that recruiters sent me that I was interested in.  I soon discovered a pattern of recruiters copying open reqs, sticking a contract period on them [0], and posting them on job boards.  I have seen multiple recruiters do this for the same position, sometimes with the actual company posting the same position on the same boards.  A few even manage to leave the company's name in the posting.  This more than anything drove me away from job boards, except SO Careers and the HN threads).<p>[0] These are all full-time regular positions.",1339772228

Never mind the fact that most of the job postings are seemingly written by people who have no idea what the job actually is. I really got tired of explaining that Java is in fact not the cool nickname for JavaScript.<p>I found my new job through a recruiter. He approached me and I found him to be quite good at his job. He talked with me first to get a feeling for my competency level and then suggested two positions with clients he has worked with before. One of them turned out to be my new job.<p>I think I talked to around ten recruiters total and only two of them knew what they were doing. The others really, really needed to find a new line of work.<p>I won't go into details of the oddities of my job hunt because I'm sure many here have similar stories.

It's actually the existence of <i>any</i> institutions that guide the behavior of people, whether they are just social traditions, or religions, or laws.<p>For example, I've found that in China, people don't tend to line up for the bus. When it's coming, people just crowd around, and so the pushiest person is the one who gets the best seat. We don't have this problem in the US, but it's not a law that solves it for us. It's because our culture has inculcated into us the idea that each person should wait his turn.<p>Conversely, the imposition of a law doesn't necessarily ""fix"" the problem behaviors. For any law to work, people must accept its legitimacy and be willing to abide by it. And there's a bit of a Catch-22 at work there, because when everyone is breaking the law, an individual will see that on an individual basis, his compliance puts him at a disadvantage.<p>There's actually been a good deal of research, especially by Bill Easterly [1], examining what institutions tend to make some cultures thrive, while others languish in poverty.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Easterly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Easterly</a>",1339772067

Yes, it does make OO-style programming easier than vanilla JS, but it also makes functional programming a heck of a lot more accessible.

4116758,comment,4115986,4115986,47,0,jashkenas,,,"This essay is fairly amazing -- there's so much emotion and so many assertions packed into it, and yet they're all founded on innuendo and hearsay, not on how things actually are. Most of the things Leon writes are factually incorrect, but at the same time, you can see how listening to enough FUD might make you start to think them...<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    > CoffeeScript classes have attributes and properties that \n    > are encouraged to be mutated by reference so a language \n    > contrivance was devised (@) to allow OO style encapsulation \n    > while still trying to provide Functional referential \n    > transparency in anonymous contexts wrap your head around that.\n</code></pre>\nWhat? Instances of CoffeeScript classes are just like any other JavaScript object with a prototype -- just like any old string or function or array. The ""language contrivance"" `@` symbol is simply an alias for `this`. Nothing more and nothing less. `@name` in CoffeeScript is just `this.name` in JavaScript -- I'm not sure how you wind up with ""functional referential transparency in anonymous contexts"" from there ... but I'll have a little of whatever Leon's smoking ;)<p>There's many other things in the essay, but the core boils down to this: There are a bunch of folks who are used to ignoring prototypes in JavaScript because they hand-roll objects by manually adding properties or using Crockford's ""module pattern"". For them, CoffeeScript's `class` keyword feels like it's adding something alien to JavaScript because it makes prototypes accessible. It's not. Using prototypes and objects lies at the core of JavaScript, and it's only the difficult and fragile syntax that leads people to manufacture new instances like this:<p><pre><code>    var makeDog = function() {\n      return {\n        bark: function(){},\n        run: function(){},\n        ...\n      };\n    };\n</code></pre>\nInstead of the <i>far</i> more efficient:<p><pre><code>    new Dog;\n</code></pre>\nFinally, CoffeeScript isn't encouraging you to do anything in particular. If you truly don't like using prototypes in JS, feel free not to use `class` in CS.<p><pre><code>    > Jeremy Ashkenas, whom I do not know but would \n    > LOVE to have a drink with (alcoholic drink or \n    > otherwise) and pick his brain ...\n</code></pre>\nPing me the next time you're in NYC.

4116757,comment,4115986,4116155,4,0,dxbydt,,,"Frankly his main gripe is that JS = FP, CoffeeScript = OO.<p>The 3 gripes you point out are mostly a consequence of Coffee choosing to do OO instead of FP & then needing hooks into JS's world to achieve this end. From the article - ""CoffeeScript sees the world through OOs eyes. When I see JavaScript, I find beauty in its ability to be a dynamically typed Functional programming language.""<p>His example is known by various other names, most commonly <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=lots+of+little+objects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=lots+of+little+objects</a><p>He wants just 2 ""objects"" ( he more specifically wants unstructured objects, or plain structs ) - sammy the python & tommy the horse. Functional JS gives him just those 2. But OO CoffeeScript gives you 5, or even 6 if you count hasProp.( var Animal, Horse, Snake, sam, tom, __hasProp. )<p>The more dramatic way to document this behavior is to have say 100 cats & 500 rats, whoe identity is captured in an int. With FP you'll be able to happily get away with just 2 ""objects"" - 1 cat and 1 rat ! The int indexing will happen via a function call. With OO you will have 600 little objects plus a bunch more for the classes and the hasProp !!<p>Here's another one I've seen - If you get two programmers to write a paddleball - one in functional JS, and the other using Coffee OO. The Coffee one will lag pretty soon. The Coffee guy will have a Ball object & a Brick object & a Wall object & each gesture will get captured as an object as well. So when the player moves the arrow keys to move the paddle, each move's x,y coordinates will become a gesture object & then gestures are passed to the ball & the wall to determine collisions....soon you'll have 1000s of gestures & the pgm will slow down unpredictably as the gc kicks in.\nThe functional JS guy won't create a single gesture object, he'll simply call some collision detection function directly with the x & y, so you'll see much better performance.<p>Ofcourse the coffee OO code will look a lot prettier than the FP one littered with curlies & function calls, but like the author says, ""JavaScripts function keyword and curly brackets arent ugly to me, they are useful indicators of code smells.""<p>So pick your poison.",1339771735

4116685,comment,4115942,4115942,8,0,illamint,,,"I've always been in the camp that rarely replaces the battery in my Mac laptops, especially with the new LiPo batteries. It's not like they're NiCads that need replacing every month (I remember having a <i>stack</i> of batteries for my Powerbook Duo). Additionally, in the past, the only other components I've replaced have been drives (adding an SSD) and memory (upgrading to the max amount supported by the board). In this case, you've already got those. If you go the 16GB route and pick an SSD appropriate to your needs (I'd never want to trust 768GB of data to one drive in a portable machine, anyways), what's left to upgrade?<p>Seriously, most people talk about adding SSDs and replacing drives: it already <i>has</i> an SSD that is near-as-makes-no-difference fast enough to saturate the SATA bus. People expecting to get the one-time boost they got from going to a 5400RPM drive to a blazing-fast SSD won't ever experience that again until we push past SATA interfaces. The 16GB of RAM you can option it out with is also pretty close to not only the limits of practicality but also the limits of the chipset. So, those points are moot. Max out the RAM and pick any SSD and you'll never need to touch them during the lifetime of the computer, and if you could, it wouldn't have any real effect. The SSD is even socketed so--should it die--you can replace it.<p>And, sure, the screen is hard to replace, but it's not like Apple's ever been the pinnacle of upgradability anyways. What were you expecting, a socketed processor and some thumbscrews so you could drop in a new chip? Whether you know it or not, this serves the needs of well over 99% of Apple's market for the MacBook Pro, and if it doesn't serve yours--if you really insist that you must be able to replace and/or repair <i>every single component</i> in your computer, then a Mac wasn't for you in the <i>first</i> place. Two Thunderbolt ports and two USB 3.0 ports further drive the point home.

While many users can create folders and somewhat organize their data, to most non-experienced users I've encountered, the mental image of a hierarchy of data segmented into directories is  not represented clearly enough by the GUI's of modern operating systems.<p>When people hear the word ""folder"" and see the folder icon, they don't think of it (the way we do) as a metaphysical representation of the overall directory tree. They simply think of a folder on a desk. A folder on a desk is not usually <i>inside</i> another folder. It's usually just sitting there. So a user without knowledge of the tree/hierarchy  model just sees various sets of folders, not a set of folders <i>within</i> other folders. Therefore getting things <i>in</i>to their Dropbox is an exercise of mental visualization that takes time and explanation.<p>Further, once I've somewhat explained this concept, I usually leave it there and tell them that ""the green checkmark means you're backed up."" The web interface is a whole new exercise in visualization that is quite a bit more difficult to pick up. Even after I tell people that ""your data is synced to the web interface,"" they don't initially understand what that entails, and believe the web interface is separate from the files they've ""backed up"" on ""their Dropbox"" (the local Dropbox folder.)<p>My girlfriend (A/B test subject #1) is used to using the ""upload"" button on the Dropbox web interface because for a good while she didn't realize things on her local folder would sync to the web interface. She's also not entirely comfortable with the hierarchy model, and the ""upload"" model is in fact easier for her to understand.<p>Reminds me of the SJ quote from an AllthingsD conference where he says every usability test hits a wall when the user encounters the filesystem.

It's the same sort of thinking that has a certain political party opposing free trade agreements out of a fear that it will bankrupt manufacturers using inefficient processes. It's a classic case of violating Henry Hazlitt's economics lesson: ""The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.""<p>While this prohibition has the immediate (apparent) consequence of 'saving' the state-controlled telephone industry and ostensibly the jobs of its workers, it has a long run consequence of raising telecom costs for the rest of the country which results in less money available for other investment, resulting in a net-loss for the economy. This will also result in an expansion of the ""industry"" of catching illegal Skypers and prosecuting and incarcerating same -- thus magnifying the net economic loss. Instead of diverting government and/or private resources into innovation, those resources will instead be consumed by reactionism.<p>The Ethiopian policy is entirely about protectionism and has nothing to do with communications security.",1339770368

But when Google came out with its 1GB storage plan in which there was nothing to delete ever, it solved a very big problem for a whole bunch of users. So while Gmail's interface is nice and Ajaxy and spam filters rock.. still the reason why everyone went through the trouble of changing their email addresses was still because of the huge space and no deleting emails everyday. Because if that wasn't there then I would have never used Gmail in the first place, let alone realize the other advantages it offered (like better ui, spam protection, etc)<p>Changing a social network similarly would also require such a huge motivation.

Whether they can stay afloat or not in the face of returns is up to them.<p>And I believe they well can stay in the black, given that:<p>* `installation' of Windows from a harddrive image is quick, low-tech and mostly hands-off process,<p>* as a major retailer they enjoy strong negotiating position with Microsoft or OEM for obtaining said images,<p>* if they really can't be bothered with the harddrive images, shipping the device to OEM for the work is cheap anyway, given they certainly exchange significant volume of cargo with 'em.<p>EDIT:<p>It does not make sense for the whole company to reject valid claims and be on the receiving end of geeks' anger. If I were to guess, the whole matter at Newegg was probably caused by some mid-level manager desperatly wanting good metrics -- like `valid customer complaints per thousand units sold' -- for his or her department.

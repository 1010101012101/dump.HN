They've been around tech all their lives, but they were never the ones that were into it. A large portion of my uncles and on both sides were, so they've had a lot of exposure. But they're unaware of a lot of the details.
Anyway, I've found out that I can learn a lot about how technology interacts with people by talking to them about it. Recently, I've had a few interesting web site ideas, and, after talking to them about it, I've learned what parts of ideas are complicated and what parts are not. Focusing on the simpler aspects means they're more likely to understand (and therefore use) whatever it is I'll eventually build. So, possibly try to think about ideas that way. If you were a user, how would you think about the tech?<p>Someone recently commented on the fact that even though I was sitting at a computer, I pulled out my phone to tweet about something interesting that just happened. I think this shows Twitter's genius: us young whippersnappers are already addicted to text messaging, and Twitter is the perfect application for texting. Not all services work well through SMS, but Twitter does. Look at its popularity in Japan. This means quite a few people already know how to use it, and some people start their Twitter accounts via phone, and never use it in any other way.",1235930388

To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. It's the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money--and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.""</i><p>To see men perform the most immoral of acts for money, it becomes easy to believe money to be a wretched thing.<p>Thus, it's not a far leap to consider the love <i>(or insane lust)</i> of money as evil.<p>Hence, the quote from the bible is there to protect men from performing acts of evil in the search for or in the name of money.",1235930271

499124,comment,499014,499053,0,0,unalone,,,"I dispute your notion that people are ""called"" to vocations. It's not that easy, never that easy. People may move in some directions more quickly than other people, but that doesn't make it some sort of preternatural thing. David Lynch is regarded as possibly the foremost filmmaker of this generation, but he started off as an artist, and he still paints in his free time, and in the meantime he's recorded music and written stories. So is ""painter"" his calling? Or is it ""director"", even though that's not what he's most interested in?<p>I'm biased reading any David Simon article because I use the context of <i>The Wire</i> as sort of an opening to Simon's points in any article. One of the big themes of <i>The Wire</i> was how people don't easily care about things immediately outside of their own frame of reference. That means that cops don't care about anything beyond cophood, politicians only care about relevant political issues, and so on.<p>The Huffington Post doesn't care about local news. They don't care about issues in Baltimore specifically. They care about big generic things, and as such they miss the point more often than not. They're a pretty poor source even for online reporting. Even the best ones, though, don't focus superlocally like actually local papers do.<p>Simon's argument isn't that newspapers are wonderful and magical, though. His argument is that newspapers <i>also</i> failed us, after they started chasing sensationalism and yellow journalism. His second point, made here, is that too few bloggers care about things like this. A local blogger doesn't have the instant influence that a journalist for a paper does. As a result, the local stuff gets even more ignored, beyond the basic cheap local news that everybody knows and nobody cares about. That's a major problem, and it's not one that's easily fixed.",1235929667

It's not necessarily that their businesses are fundamentally flawed.  It can simply be that they've built up cruft - like the $5 daily coffee and $150/mo cable bill that many of my friends racked up during fat years.  In many cases, getting back to basics would release a lot of the pressure.<p>But there's also the unique situation of over-leverage.  Businesses haven't been conservative with their capital - rather, hoping that they could provide better returns for increased risk and sometimes even just spending money on projects without enough regard to the value of those projects.  In fact, management has often been criticized for acting conservatively in recent years since it leads to lower returns (at least in the short-run).<p>Warren Buffet once wrote, ""I've never believed in risking what my family and friends have and need in order to pursue what they don’t have and don’t need.""  Businesses should make money - they good and services they produce advance our standard of living.  However, it's a little clear that they need to concentrate on their foundations a little more so that bad times become lost potential and not lost businesses.",1235927323

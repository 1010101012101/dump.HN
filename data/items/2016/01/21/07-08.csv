My mother language is German (Fun fact: My mother does not speak German, so, maybe I should also call it my &quot;primary language&quot;). I do speak Turkish but like many Turkish people who have been born in Germany, I can&#x27;t communicate well in Turkish[1] (and neither in Greek nor Bulgarian). If I were to join an army and communicate under stress (being a pacifist, even the thought gives me the chills though), I&#x27;d rather speak German or compromise with English. So, as I said before, I think there is a high chance that they do communicate partially in English. However close-minded they can be, practicality always wins. Always.<p>[1]: Actually some do speak Turkish somewhat fluently, but I can&#x27;t tell if being able to describe your favorite cocktail to a bartender in a Turkish hotel proves that you can describe further tactics to fellow combatants under suppressive fire.",1453363181

10943967,comment,10942505,10943650,0,0,jrockway,,,"Those antennas are just for show.<p>There are plenty of short-range wireless technologies currently under development that use the SHF/EHF bands to send data at very high speeds.  There is plenty of bandwidth up at 60GHz.  Furthermore, the processing power of affordable chips is very high, so they can control an array of antennas that send the signal exactly where the other end of the connection is (WiFi is starting to do this, and cellular networks have done this for a while).  For connecting your hard drive and monitor to a nearby laptop, I think this will work fine.<p>The big &quot;problem&quot; with these bands is that they don&#x27;t propagate through walls, or even your hand or a sheet of paper.  But with beamforming they can go around your hand, so it&#x27;s not a problem for things like connecting to monitors, in theory.<p>Wall penetration is a big problem for WiFi.  WiFi&#x27;s very limited bandwidth is shared among all stations that can hear each other.  When walls block the signal, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re creating a brand new Universe free of other stations and interference, and so you get free bandwidth.  This is why corporate AP deployments turn _down_ the power of their access points, so they only cover a small area, thus allowing the system to have more total bandwidth.<p>Ideally the clients would also turn down their transmit power, but they don&#x27;t because that&#x27;s bad for benchmarks and reviews, so they kind of ruin this by bleeding their signals intended for the nearby AP into the range where other clients that can&#x27;t hear that AP are.  Fortunately things like beamforming and MU-MIMO are fixing this, by allowing receivers to move a null in their receive antenna system to where the unwanted device is, thus providing isolation from nearby devices and increasing the total bandwidth of the system.  We&#x27;ve been promised this for years but it&#x27;s still in what I think are the early stages.<p>(As for the use case of &quot;I want one WiFi router to cover my whole city!&quot; we&#x27;re not there yet.  You need an AP in every room, with a wired backhaul.  Meshing might solve this... but it is also in the very early stages.)",1453363010

If you trace the threads back to &quot;online lead generation experts&quot; or &quot;internet marketing specialists&quot;, you&#x27;ll find lots of such enterprises.<p>In my case, most of the active properties I knew are offline (though their proprietors are still rich). One guy was trying to be Tim Ferriss and had a membership site that promised to teach users how to get rich working no more than 4 hours a day. He had about 2 dozen other sites generating some income here or there, but I don&#x27;t remember any others. They were hosted on a rack with 3 FreeBSD servers running in the corner of his office that some contractor had set up years earlier.<p>One guy was selling really bad eBay listing management software. He also had sites meant to ease the process of applying for government grants, a site that referred patients to audiologists for new hearing aids (which resulted in a lawsuit from the competitor that he had ripped off), and others.<p>Although all of these projects were objectively terrible and not competitive with the good products in each field, these guys almost undoubtedly made way more money than the programmers of the products they&#x27;re trying to copy because they had much better SEO and spam game. While the dev who builds decent products is spending his free time thinking of the amazing features he&#x27;s going to build and how much his users will appreciate them, the career spammer is thinking about which of his spam sites he needs to swap links with next so that Google doesn&#x27;t detect the link ring and decrease the PageRank, and how he needs to add another minimum wage lackey to keep up with all the astroturfing they need to do.<p>I know of several similar schemes. They aren&#x27;t the edgy startups we hear about here on HN, but the proprietors end up making quite the pretty penny off these things, despite the fact that none of them have any interest in the subject matter, nor any technical skill. They spam and rake in the dough, getting their tech work done by offshore contractors on oDesk if they can&#x27;t find a naive local student who&#x27;ll work only for promises of equity.<p>The moral of the story is that devs need to spend their time getting access to a network of sites that make it easy to gain PageRank for any desired term and tapping good astroturfing resources instead of working on features. It&#x27;s really discouraging as a tech entrepreneur trying to provide quality products.",1453362826

10943956,comment,10939457,10940032,0,0,Al-Khwarizmi,,,"I&#x27;m not American but European, but in the 80s and 90s I remember there was a general perception of progress, of things getting better and better. We got some inventions that were a revolution for people&#x27;s everyday life, like computers, mobile phones and the Internet. Achievements like putting a man on the moon were still rather recent and still seemed like they would be repeated. Religion appeared to be on a decline in the West and freedom of expression on the rise, without being so much menaced by religious bigots on the one side and political correctness on the other. People weren&#x27;t worried about terrorism (at least compared to now), one could go to the airport and ride a plane in like 10 or 15 minutes.<p>I think there was a general change in attitude at the turn of the millennium, of course the symbolic turning point was 9/11, although it would probably have happened anyway. But the 9/11 changes were especially visible, we went from being a society that took bold steps forward to a society that walked cautiously and scaredly - and that&#x27;s even in Europe, I suppose it was even more noticeable in America.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there would have been as much as a consensus about being in the best of all possible times, but I think if you asked in the 90s many people would answer that they were better than any past time, and still improving. You would get that kind of answer much less often now. All this in the West, of course. I suppose if you ask e.g. in China, things would be quite different.",1453362798

NYC has pretty substantial public transit presence that could and probably should be the transit answer for far more people, however, people chose cars for a variety of reasons.<p>For <i>some</i> of the population, cars probably are a necessity; commuting may not always have a convenient transit option into the city and as such these people have a legitimate need. What the article, and likely the commenter, are suggesting, is that the &quot;need&quot; for parking is a result of a want for cars, not a need for cars, and the article is suggesting the trend is reversing. I think the commenter is suggesting is that it&#x27;s time to start discouraging those who would take a car when they really don&#x27;t need to, especially in high density urban populations with substantial public transit presence, and that with an alternative on the horizon, it&#x27;s time for cities to start reclaiming space that was formerly given to parking.<p>Tangential to this response, I am pretty glad to see that the article takes a more realistic look at the future with self-driving cars. I have been reading comments and articles for a long time where people envision &quot;their&quot; self-driving car, but I&#x27;ve always thought it far more practical to have fleets of these cars instead that are summoned rather than owned by an individual.",1453362554

If our encoding of a hypermedia response is a JSON document, the format definition should describe how we can interpret that response to perform some action.<p>If the service we provide is as general as a Web Page, then using a standardised format like HTML makes a huge amount of sense.

A good number of the big...and biggest, names are our clients. I guess we would mostly fall into the &#x27;mint for CRE&#x27; category, except property/assets are just a piece of it. We go all the way up through loans, deals, equity, the cap stack for each thing and the entire portfolio. All with realtime reporting/analytics, data integration from anywhere (extremely simple to use, unlike most systems...), chart of accounts roll ups, etc. It has been a TON of development time (close to 3 years now) and is a massive system.<p>I think we&#x27;ll see some more adopted standards in data schemas and APIs with governmental organizations that will really change the CRE world. Underwriting and securitization is a huge opportunity for when that becomes more widely adopted. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re quite familiar with the securitization process of today and how crazy it seems...excel workbooks and binders full of reports everywhere is a nightmare.<p>Argus is such a big player, however they won&#x27;t get disrupted all at once in my opinion. So many processes, reports and data is intertwined in it, it&#x27;ll take some time to unravel...but yes, big opportunity.<p>All in all, many of the &#x27;ideas&#x27; in CRE are well known, it&#x27;s getting the industry on a macro and micro scale to adopt new practices and solutions that are actually good. For example, think of all the CRE loans out there...to get detail information on them ( thousands and thousands..) you really have to pay big money to someone like Intex or something. And then parsing that data even more to be useable at scale is a whole other undertaking.<p>I&#x27;m interested to see how the &#x27;crowdsourcing&#x27; CRE world develops. That space is pretty wide open with big but unestablished players.<p>I&#x27;ve got many ideas for stuff I want to do down the road, let&#x27;s talk.<p>Note: I didn&#x27;t edit this at all, it&#x27;s probably filled with grammer errors...but it&#x27;s late and don&#x27;t care =p",1453360697

In this case though, do you really need 170 sq. feet to store whatever you are carrying with you? Opening parking lots to development will generate enough value to provide a couple 12x18x72 inch lockers for each space removed. That still clears up over 98% of the square footage currently being taken up by parking spaces, and it would obviate the need to use cars for personal storage.<p>It might even lower theft since a big component of theft from automobiles is that a thief can look into a bunch of cars and only break in when something valuable enough is identified. And since lockers could be located inside where the people are, it would probably opportunities for would be thieves to have alone time with valuables.<p>> people like to forget stuff in their cars<p>If cars begin to be produced primarily for the purpose of transporting a single different person over and over again all day (with a smaller number of multi-passenger vehicles being produced for the relatively rare case of multi-passenger rides), then I imagine that eventually they would evolve a design that makes it more obvious when you drop things you are carrying. Currently cars[1] have all kinds of nooks and crannies for your wallet to fall into, because it&#x27;s not that big a problem in most cases when you do that. But it would be fairly trivial to add a little fiber glass hip that sits flush with the seat. You would have to relocate the seat adjustment controls, but a lot of vehicles have already centralized those controls on the main console, and ridesharing vehicles would actually see enough benefit to consider such a change.<p>[1] this includes taxis because taxis fleets are made up of essentially consumer vehicles. This makes sense, because you always have at least 2 people in a taxi, so you can&#x27;t really comfortably make it that much smaller. But if there were fleets of rideshared self-driving cars everywhere, most cars would only need to carry a single person, and you can drastically reduce the size of a one-person car without sacrificing comfort.<p>Edit: added third paragraph and the accompanying footnote",1453360678

And I think that is because HATEOAS has never found a natural expression in JSON.<p>So I&#x27;m saying: if you want to follow REST-ful principles for your web application, you should abandon a data-level API entirely, and move to a partial HTML model instead, where HTML allows you to naturally leverage HATEOAS without even really thinking about it.<p>Ad, deep insight, whatever.  It&#x27;s a thing.",1453359646

Every Canadian programmer is a skip, a hop and a TN visa away from a USD$100k job. Taking less money to stay home in Canada was one thing with the dollar at parity, but all of a sudden the pay differential from the employee&#x27;s perspective is pushing 100%. Canadian companies already want people worth USD$100k in the US to take CAD$80k in Vancouver or Toronto. That&#x27;s now just USD$55k.<p>The biggest struggle I&#x27;ve heard from a lot of Canadian companies is the difficulty of holding onto talent given the proximity of the US and the fact that Canadians are blessed with a far simpler visa process than other foreigners. Doesn&#x27;t that effect become even worse as CAD drops relative to USD if employers in Canada don&#x27;t make up the difference?",1453359624

1571613,comment,1569559,1570771,0,0,tzs,,,"> Different systems simply have different conventions, and GNU picked GNU Info over man pages.<p>Sure, but that's no reason to be hostile to man pages. Ideally you have a man page, which provides a standard quick reference for those how know the command, and then other documents (such is Info) for people who need more detailed information, complete manuals, etc.. In fact, that's how it was way back in the Seventh Edition days of Unix, with the UPM providing the in-depth documentation and the man pages providing the quick reference.<p>If the GNU people don't want to actually write the man pages, they could at least not stand in the way of those who would like to provide them. Here's another variant of the note from the GNU tar man page on some Linux systems:<p><pre><code>    The GNU folks, in general, abhor man pages, and create info\n    documents instead.  Unfortunately, the info document describing\n    tar is licensed under the GFDL with invariant cover texts, which\n    makes it impossible to include any text from that document in this\n    man page.  Most of the text in this document was automatically\n    extracted from the usage text in the source.  It may not completely\n    describe all features of the program.</code></pre>",1280851104

1571608,comment,1569825,1570504,0,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>If you use a two-word representation, you can't atomically set a value.</i><p>At least on 32-bit x86 this isn't true. CMPXCHG8B can atomically write 64 bits of data and has been supported by CPUs for decades. The x86-64 equivalent, CMPXCHG16B, for atomic 128-bit writes is more problematic, as early Athlon64/Opteron CPUs did not support it. But even on 64-bit systems, a 64-bit encoding should be good enough. Technically, the address space can comprise 48 bits, but even if you steal a couple more than 16 for the NaN coding you should have more than enough for a few decades.<p>PowerPC, ARM, etc. have different atomicity guarantees though, which make this sort of thing more problematic. However, as far as I know, even Web Worker threads don't share JS context state with the main thread, so this is probably a non-issue.<p><i>I don't really see the practical benefit.</i><p>Probably to avoid cache misses.",1280851040

1571588,comment,1571516,1571516,0,0,sophacles,,,"How appropriate, I just finished a paper today and submitted it for review.  LaTeX is awesome and sucky at the same time. On the awesome side, you have structure separate from formatting. This comes with lots of benefits as mentioned in the article. It also allows you to use the concept of imports (or includes if you will), so you can have <i>a well factored paper</i>.  It also allows you to do sane things like footnote, cite and reference diagrams and sources without a need for explicit number tracking -- just give everything a unique identifier that works for you.  Finally if you do well enough with your structuring you can output not just different file formats like pdf or ps or whatnot, you can also output completely different styles. It is pretty simple to wrap your core with the trappings of IEEE style for one version and a book-like style for another.<p>On the sucky side, the toolchain is notoriously difficult and cryptic.  For some reason you have to make multiple passes of various tools by hand (or with a makefile -- i reccommend <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/</a> it just works).  The syntax can be a bit inconsistent.  The worst is the errors tho, sometimes it is impossible to figure out why all your figures are showing up at the end of the document instead of in-place, or why all your references are failing to point at anything.<p>Overall tho, it is a fantastic system :)",1280850818

I don’t really care about startups – I'm a physics graduate student planning on going into academia – but I do care about programming and tech. I have not yet been able to find an active online community that caters to these interests that I would describe as being ""female-friendly."" At HN, at least, sexist jokes are usually downvoted/discouraged because of their lack of content, which is more than I can say for Reddit. I generally enjoy HN except when the community decides to discuss gender, which it seems to do multiple times a week, even when it's only tangentially related to the article and despite it already having been beaten to death on this very site a million times over. These conversations invariably turn into, ""Women: Does society screw them up or is there just something weird with their brains (on average of course, let's be PC here)? Dudes speculate."" This is the most interesting topic to hackers, apparently.<p>I guess it's good to know that HN just feels like a woman-free space because it practically <i>is</i>, in contrast to sites like Reddit that feel that way even with ~2/5 of the users being female.",1280850793

To me, that's where all of the brilliant students go, to the professors who convince them, through their passion and excitement for the next generation, to take up a particular field of study.

The existence of sperm sorting technology, and of prenatal determination of fetal sex via ultrasound along with the option of termination, means that we now have the power to choose the sex of our children. An influential contemporary line of thought about medical ethics suggests that we should use technology to serve the welfare of individuals and to remove limitations on the opportunities available to them. I argue that, if these are our goals, we may do well to move towards a “post sex” humanity. Until we have the technology to produce genuine hermaphrodites, the most efficient way to do this is to use sex selection technology to ensure that only girl children are born. There are significant restrictions on the opportunities available to men, around gestation, childbirth, and breast-feeding, which will be extremely difficult to overcome via social or technological mechanisms for the foreseeable future. Women also have longer life expectancies than men. Girl babies therefore have a significantly more “open” future than boy babies. Resisting the conclusion that we should ensure that all children are born the same sex will require insisting that sexual difference is natural to human beings and that we should not use technology to reshape humanity beyond certain natural limits. The real concern of my paper, then, is the moral significance of the idea of a normal human body in modern medicine. </i>",1280847619

Take a look at the SPLASH talk linked in another comment here, and see how the ""pain points"" mentioned either apply mainly to C and C++ (dependency issues, build times in the case of the latter), or are independent of the language in general (like poor documentation). Then at least 4 sections on that page are just related to dependencies and build times (about 1/3rd of the entire article).<p>No one is denying that C and C++ have many problems. At the same time though, many of those problems have been solved in other languages (both older and newer than C++).",1370033948

I'm actually not particularly concerned one way or the other; it certainly isn't as if Google hasn't pivoted to whatever the standard solution is in the past even when they've previously embraced (and enabled-by-default) a solution that ended up failing to become the standard. If Google was trying to push developer-focussed tooling as a business model and so was invested in its proprietary solutions winning, that would be different, but AFAICT there business model around improving web performance is to enable people to do more in the browser without relying on external code for the underlying OS, and if asm.js addresses that problem its just as good for them as it would be if PNaCl did it.",1370033942
5801347,comment,5800345,5800851,2,0,vortmeester,,,"An interesting idea, but I think this argument leaves out an important fact: money in the present is more useful than money in the future. This is often captured in accounting by use of a ""discount rate"". A pretty conventional number is 10% per year: waiting an extra year to receive some money makes it worth 10% less, all else equal. Comparing a typical interest rate and a typical discount rate, I would conclude that you should donate now.<p>Furthermore, if this is really the best way to do charity... well, charities could just invest the donations they receive and cash out when the time is ""right"". But since organizations don't die, when would that ever be?<p>Lastly, the idea that you should invest in a single ""best"" charity entails the idea that your donation is too small to make much difference in which charity is best. But some problems have already been solved! More problems will surely be solved in the future. It seems that charities could face diminishing returns -- like most other investments -- so your most effective strategy should sometimes be to split among more than one. Especially if you have followed the advice to invest for your entire life, and you do have a huge sum to donate.",1370033942

If you multiply two unknown quantities, you can not assume anything about the result, even if one of them is very big. So basically what you're saying is ""we have no idea if it's dangerous or not, and there's absolutely no evidence on any danger present, but if it were, you could DIE!!! so PANIC!!!"" This would be an extremely irrational and stupid behavior.<p>>>> But the benefits are small to nonexistent, especially for your typical first-worlder who as I mentioned is drowning in food.<p>The problem is that it is very fragile. If the anti-science idiots ever prevail, the whole food abundance we have now could very well collapse pretty quickly - without science, malthusian scenarios are very real, and the people who predicted massive hunger by 2000s could very well be right if science did not intervene. If the idiots ever succeed in their war on science, first world would be in no way insulated from the disastrous effects of their victory. The whole abundance <i>is</i> the <i>direct effect</i> of what you call ""food liberalism"" and it is the only thing maintaining it.<p>>>> The same calculus underlies decisions to take out insurance policies<p>Not at all. Insurance companies have very accurate actuarial and statistical data, which they use in very accurate and specific ways to issue insurance. They never base their decisions on ""multiply two unknown numbers, make assumptions on the result, panic"". Your decision on buying the insurance may very well be irrational, but the insurance market itself is very rational.<p>>>> Statistically you'll probably be better off not buying insurance<p>It is not true, since you can not be better ""statistically"" - the fact that it didn't happen to 100000 people would not improve your situation if it happens to you. The whole function of insurance is to make statistics work for you, without it statistics would be just a useless trivia - just as the fact that if Bill Gates walks into a bar, the average income of the bar visitors jumps - is useless for anybody in the bar, because they get no money from it. Insurance is the way to get you some money from statistics.",1370033794

This connection creates a risk of revolt, and a sensible king will be mindful of it.<p>In a democratic society with a Kafkaesque prison system, torture of prisoners is not as easily associated with any one person's cruelty. Because most people are optimistic and don't like to believe that several hundred million of their neighbors would silently condone the torture of a whole class of people, it's easy for lazy minds to consider prisoner torture acceptable, necessary, justified, and so on to whatever stronger beliefs these individuals may hold.<p>I'm not saying that prisoners would fare any better in a non-democratic society, but how people think of prisoner mistreatment would definitely be different.",1370033095

It can also show up as a dedication to a particular self-brewed approach, despite strong hints from experts that some other approach probably would work better.<p>To turn that into direct advice, try to identify a mentor at work-- your boss may be one, but you really want a technical mentor-- who can spare you an hour a week or so to bounce ideas off of, and to give you an occasional nudge when you go astray (which you will).  And then respect that mentor's time, by weighing his or her advice carefully before you reject it.<p>Another thing I've noticed is that physicists are very fast at making inroads on problems they've never encountered before.  I'm not a physicist, so I can only speculate about why, but in general I think it relates both to their broad background training, and to an approach that emphasizes estimation as part of the analysis.  I feel like physicists are far less likely than others to start off chasing a solution that's likely to tackle only 1% of the problem.<p>To turn that into direct advice, before you plunge off on some tack that you find interesting, try to perceive the outline to the answer of how this approach is going to solve the problem, or a substantial amount of your problem.  Obviously you need time to build up your technical background, but maybe thinking in these terms will help you not only find the most likely research approach, but also figure out where you personally want to invest your time acquiring expertise.<p>Finally, the fact that you posted your question to HN implies your problem space is programming-related.  Another side of the student/employee dichotomy is that students are much less likely to consider IP issues when scavenging code.

5801204,comment,5799167,5801109,2,0,rayiner,,,"> Isn't it more important to advocate a policy than to try to interpret the placement of a comma?<p>I mean that question is the ""emacs versus vi"" of holy wars in the legal community. My legal philosophy tends to lean towards pragmatic/conservative, which means I think it's generally more important to interpret the placement of the comma. The reason is that, like conservatives generally, I tend to view the Constitution as an agreement, the last time Americans ever agreed on anything (and then just barely). So given the extreme lack of consensus today, I think it's at least a principled position to fall back to the existing agreement.<p>At the same time, I'm pragmatically concerned about judicial legitimacy, which is a function of how the judiciary spends its political capital. The farther judicial decisions stray from the original intent of the laws, the more political capital is spent. Every time the judiciary disagrees with the elected branches, political capital is spent (see, e.g., the response to Citizens United, which is an excellent interpretation of the law, but went against what the political branches wanted). I don't think its wrong for judges to ""legislate from the bench"" but I recognize that it costs political capital to do so, and that this political capital is best saved for situations in which there is an acute need to overturn the existing agreement (e.g. I'll concede that Roe v. Wade was a very tenuous interpretation of the law, but I also think it was one of the rare cases where it was necessary for the court to make up law out of thin air).<p>But that's my two cents. As I said, it's the subject of much religious zealotry. Lots of people would say that the most important thing is to establish the ""right"" policies. In terms of what policy I think is best, I'm a huge fan of judicial oversight, so I think the only exceptions to the warrant requirements should be exigent circumstances (e.g. searching a suspect for weapons at a crime scene).",1370032340

See this for a picture: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Benzene_Representations.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Benzene_Representations.sv...</a>\nSo, the electrons in a benzene ring really form more of a cloud around the entire ring.

Even if I'm off base, 16:10 is certainly not hard to find.<p>Second, while I agree that computing activities lend themselves well to vertical orientation, like you suggest, they lend themselves <i>even more</i> to multi displays and multi tasking.<p>So the question is do you really want 2 or 4 or 8 vertical displays, with a physical seam between each of them, or do you want 1 or 2 or 3 horizontal displays, all split in two with your window manager, and with fewer physical seams ?<p>I organize my workspaces vertically, and I have 3x 16:10 monitors split into (roughly) 6 vertical workspaces.  I only have two physical seams.  If monitors were not horizontal, I  would have 6 displays with 5 vertical seams.<p>So if you're working on a laptop, or have just one screen, I feel your pain.

However when we came back to the US there was simply no opportunity to use it so I have lost most of it. Same goes for Spanish that I used to use semi-regularly when I was in my teens.<p>Naturally when I joined college I started studying language classes, Japanese the first year and every year after, as well as concurrently learning Chinese starting the second, I also went to college in Japan for a year focused on upper level Japanese. The process was me religiously studying, watching tv shows, constantly writing essays on my thoughts about society, culture, news, Rubik's Cubes, artificial intelligence, etc. even blog daily. Also listen to music. I can't emphasize enough how much I'd write and from the beginning engage daily in only using Japanese and Chinese in conversation. It took a year and a half to be conversational in Japanese (largely due to the completely different grammar and kanji) and for Chinese only around a year. I have also recently started Korean, to find that the overlap of Chinese and Japanese make it almost trivial to learn. So language similarity is also important.<p>Also in my years of interacting with foreigners who are learning English. The best speakers are typically ones who came here younger, there is even a large difference to students who studied abroad as early as high school (versus college)<p>I can definitely contest that you can still learn a language to very technical competency as late as in college.

The basic idea is that existing applications can have their own proprietary way of getting data into their systems, and we want to evolve a standard way of getting data out of these systems. We are developing an API specification around this. <a href=""https://github.com/openmhealth/developer/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/openmhealth/developer/wiki</a><p>Once app developers adopt the Open mHealth approach, much of the work of getting data out of these silo'ed apps will be done. This is important because the real value of this data comes about when the streams are combined to be analyzed and visualized.<p>I am posting here because many of the issues outlined in this thread and in the original post are things we are actively trying to solve.",1370030495

Armstrong does not meet your requirements, would you like to take the matter up with mr. McCarthy instead?<p>> And this particular thread seems to be more grounded in discussing FP concepts than Erlang.<p>So? That makes it ok to speak in a disparaging manner about someone who did more for reliability of complex FP systems than anybody else that I'm currently aware of? And to fail to even do the author the courtesy of checking his/her credentials before firing off an ill thought out rant?<p>Really, not recognizing your elders and betters, -5 points, not knowing who they are, -50 points and being dead wrong on top of all that -500. The article is interesting for one reason only, it's Joe Armstrong writing about a new entrant on the VM that he designed and for those that are interested in such stuff his opinion carries a lot of weight. To dismiss his writings as the drivel of just another anonymous 'someone' who couldn't be bothered to do his homework about FP is ridiculous.<p>Anyway, I'm done with this thread.",1370030471

Yes, that's exactly the benefit.<p>You could in fact have heterogeneous JSON documents within one file, and json_fdw could still handle them. If a field you declared in the table schema doesn't appear in a JSON document, json_fdw would just consider that field to be Null.<p>The issue is, json_fdw is built such that one table can only associated with one JSON file, and users typically have many JSON files lying around. For example, you'd have one JSON file for each hour's worth of website error logs.<p>If that's the case, you could create a distributed table. That way, you could run the query one distributed table and have the query run on all your JSON files instead of just one.<p>That said, it's probably best to associate one type of JSON logs (say your website error logs) with one distributed table. That way, your queries go over your website error logs or your mobile application logs, but not both at the same time.",1370030430

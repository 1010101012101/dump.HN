1107191,comment,1106635,1106635,0,0,blahedo,,,"As an avowed chalkboard lecturer, I can totally understand where the OP is coming from, and I can add a few more reasons why chalkboards are better:<p>1. Non-linearity---it's easy to reconfigure the lecture on the fly if I'm chalking it out on the board.<p>2. Interactivity---I can ask for and actually use examples from the students when working through something, and I can even ask the students to come up and write something on the board when appropriate.<p>3. Real estate---In a good classroom, I might have seven or eight times the area of chalkboard as I do projector screen, and I don't need to erase anything until it's all full.  That makes it much easier to refer back to earlier points.  It also gives everything I wrote a ""place"", and I can refer back to what I had ""over there on that board"" sometimes two or three classes later, and if I don't need the precise content (just a general reminder), that's often enough to refresh it in students' minds.<p>4. Editing---Have you ever been in a PP-based lecture where there were some errors in a formula or graph or equation?  (It might be better to ask if you've ever been in one <i>without</i> errors...)  These are hard to edit out, and if the slides for students to look at later, how often does the prof correct them first?  I had a theory class in grad school that was <i>terrible</i> for this.<p>One ""big"" advantage for PP isn't even unique to it: sure, I could post a PDF of my slides for students to read later.  You know what I do instead?  Snap a photo of the chalkboards after each class and post that.<p>The only reason to use projected slides IMO is when there is a long formula that students don't have to write down (e.g. it's in the book) that I need to point to, or a particular graph or diagram that needs to be precise.  For these things, I stick a PDF of the formula or diagram on the course website, and pull that up during class to talk about it... briefly, before going back to the chalkboard.",1265513629

Or did that ""serious deflation"" you refer to start sometime around the birth of the railroad? ;)<p>I think the culprit here is not deflation of the language -- the language has always been ambiguous -- but rather inflation of the scope of engineering education. It's not just for P.E.s anymore. If you believe the term <i>engineer</i> should be restricted to P.E.s you should start by explaining that to every academic engineering department I've ever seen, all of which are happy to hand out ""engineering degrees"" to graduating ""engineering students"" who tend to be called ""engineers"" for short, whether or not they go on to get a P.E.

We definitely had one pre-prepared essay type, but most of these were lecturers would just freely write on OHP reels instead of the blackboard. I found that a lot worse, due to people trying to write legibly/exaggeratedly on blackboards but writing 'normally' (and totally illegibly) on OHPs. But my sympathies for the overhead essays, I've been there.",1265511926

No problem, he says, I will just imagine myself in the same physical condition as the scolded player. But would that be enough?<p>If you want to be good at playing soccer you need to know about tactics and strategy, you need the experience of hundreds of games. Can the soccer fan just imagine himself having all that and still be sure whether he would have passed to a different player? Probably not. Why would all those changes to his brain keep the part intact with which he just decided which would have been the best pass?<p>I might be committing a fundamental attribution error by concentrating too much on the brain side of things, though. Situation can be the other and maybe even more straightforward reason why the teleported soccer fan would probably fare not much better than the player. The fan has a bird eye’s view, multiple camera angles and instant replay, the player doesn’t. The fan is sitting in the pub, the player is running around. And so on.<p>You might want to be careful when using this phrase, then. Maybe yell something like: “The optimal pass which maximally increases the chance of scoring a goal would have been to pass to that other player, you idiot!”",1265511854

Maybe it's time to think about the problem differently.  There's a ton of things that can be done without a high refresh rate.  Some video games, and videos, are just about the only things that <i>require</i> the high refresh rate, and the Kindle is NOT a game platform.",1265511767

You only get one or two hours of small group tuition per week per topic, so you need to make the most of it. The system generally goes: go to lectures to be introduced to the core concepts in play, have a sheet of 10-20 example questions to work on per week, bring as much of the questions as you can do to your supervision and go through the correct forms. In between we generally worked in peer groups to make sure we had enough to bring to the supervisions in the first place.",1265511688

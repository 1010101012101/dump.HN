For you it was probably a matter of being zillionears but for music lovers ? The dynamic pricing thing looks also fishy in the sense that no one except you are in control of pricing, or its algorithm. This gives the feeling to be exposed to be screwed, the artists and the potential buyers.<p>My feeling is that you conceived the startup guided mainly by your desires than the one of the artists, visitors and clients.

5537032,comment,5535467,5536799,2,0,bradleyjg,,,"The DREAM Act has been introduced in every Congress for over a decade. It has gotten close a few times, but is stuck in the politics of 'amnesty'. Executive branch defered action has been in place for almost a year now, and while it's strictly inferior to a legislative solution it's far better than nothing.<p>All of which is to say that there is a well developed political lobby on both sides of that issue. While I'm sure the DREAM Act supporters wouldn't mind getting big checks from SV millionaires and billionaires thier voices would add little to the debate. Similarly, the major private sector unions and national buisness association, after much back and forth forged a compromise on blue collar temporary work visas sensitive to the needs of both.<p>It makes sense for the tech industry -- both the owners and workers -- to speak out on topics that are salient to them. That's where they are most knowledgable and where thier opinions will be most respected. There is no need to feel guilty or try and shame anyone for concentrating on the those issues.",1365749823

5537027,comment,5534429,5535925,2,0,lazyBilly,,,"> That's not going to happen either, under the current system.<p>Well, the dynamics of who will get paid as a result of the legal recording arrangements are well beyond the scope of this conversation, and I don't believe the terms of somebody's recording deal, whatever they might be, negate wholesale expropriation of someone's artistic output.  I find the whole ""FAT CAT RECORD LABELS ARE PARASITES, STICK IT TO THE MAN!!!"" argument to be kind of disingenuous.<p>> Here your own argument comes back to bite you. Really good sampling takes just as much blood, sweat, and tears invested as the other skill sets you cite.<p>This is.... categorically not true.  I'm sorry.  I have no small familiarity with electronic music and sampling, having transitioned over a while back after seeing the writing on the wall in terms of making music the old-school way, and while I would not hesitate to say that it requires skill and, above all, taste, there is little if any comparison to a singular analog musician, let alone an entire ensemble.  I realize I'm going to be called old fashioned in this respect, but I've done both, and I can DJ a heck of a lot better than DJ's can sing, play guitar, bass, keys (live keys), and drums.  Each instrument takes a lifetime to master, point blank.<p>You're right, I abused 'externality' a little.  Not completely, but it's a little strained.<p>All I'll say here is what I said before-- for little songs, kick a small mechanical royalty to the rights holders so they can pay their bills.  For big gold record songs, if you want to ride the coattails of AC/DC, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, or whoever, pay the toll that they dictate or write your own hook.<p>To take the 'sampling' debate into another realm, consider taking the likeness of a famous actor and CGIing it into some other, derivative work.  This isn't so farfetched, really.  Didn't 30 Rock do a bit a couple years back where they tried to CGI Jerry Seinfeld into NBC's flailing lineup?<p>And according to the ideas proposed in that article, wouldn't that be ANY derivative work, any time?  Like some technicolor nightmare of a porno where James Dean bangs Elizabeth Taylor?  Do they have a right to say 'no thank you'?  Do they have a right to say 'yeah, but it'll cost you'?  What about somebody like Tom Waits, who's consistently declined to make his work available in commercials?  Can Girl Talk sample him and then put it in a Doritos ad?

Of the 110182 characters Unicode 6.2 defines Windows 8 (the only thing I can test at the moment) includes glyphs for 102082 of them out of the box. The missing ones fall mostly into either rarely-used CJK ideograph or historical script (like Hieroglyphs).<p>Unicode serves many different needs and not all characters are necessary to support in a general-purpose OS. There are fonts to cover the missing pieces and professionals working in fields requiring those usually have them installed.<p>There is also little benefit to provide a single font that encompasses all of Unicode. Designers pick fonts for aesthetic reasons and every script has different styles (although Latin, Greek and Cyrillic are fairly similar which is why they usually are all included in every font). E.g. you have the main distinctions into serif and sans-serif (for non-decorative body text). This distinction never existed for scripts like Han, Hebrew, Arabic, various Indic scripts, etc. So if you were to create only one font, what are your choices to include for every script? Pan-Unicode fonts are mostly useful as fallback fonts to ensure that you can see some rarely-used glyphs but for nearly all practical purposes they cannot be used for anything else. It's also an enormous effort beyond creating the glyphs because you'll have to include kerning tables, define positions where combining characters appear, etc. Those are often issues that make such pan-Unicode fonts unusable because yes, they may contain plenty of glyphs but cannot be used reliably to render text that goes beyond simple scripts (and diacritic placement can even be wrong with just Latin.",1365748327

The sentiment was worthwhile, and I can also see it within the musical tradition of rap and the soundsystem aesthetic where musicians develop their MCing skills by rapping over over a sampled loop in their bedroom/the garage etc. so to build a whole song over a single looped sample with a minimum of additional production elements actually served a musical function of evoking nostalgia for 'the way things used to be' when the people in question were young and just learning how to rap.

If BitCoin slowly but surely keeps providing utility and gains financial market volume, it will eventually stabilize in price. It's volatile now because the outstanding value of BitCoins is about$ $1 Billion, but the amount of investors trading it are capable of causing it take big swings. This makes it an attractive market to play in since the amount that can be made in a single day is high. This should eventually increase the number of investors in the market, increasing the total value of the market. If this goes on for long enough, the outstanding market value will grow and BitCoin will stabilize further and further, making it more suitable as a currency.<p>BitCoin right now is like the market for a low volume commodity like Caviar.

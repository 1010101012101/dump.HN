My 20ies are gone.</i><p>This, and I mean it in a kind way, is totally batshit absurd and thinking this way will only hold you back. I know the feeling. I felt it myself and spun my wheels for years because of it.<p>When I turned 30, I had just graduated from business school (which I went to because I couldn't figure out what to do with my life). I had never built a real piece of software, and object oriented programming seemed to be too much for me - I too had started that journey with C++ and failed. (For me, it was Ruby that made it click, for what it's worth).<p>So here I am, 30, with some interest in technology with an MBA and no programming skill. I truly thought I had wasted the last 8 years of my life since college. What was I doing during those years. I was working at NASA. On the Hubble Space Telescope. I was paid to scuba dive with astronauts and build hardware that would fly in space. I own not one, but TWO pieces of the actual Hubble Space Telescope that flew in space. Looking back, that job was a dream come true - jobs do not get much better. But at 30, looking forward I thought it had all been a waste of time - my 20's were gone, and I was woefully unprepared for the business I wanted to start. There were people smarter, younger, and more successful than me everywhere I looked.<p>It was a ridiculous way to think for me, and it is for you too. Enjoy life, and don't compare your inside to someone else's outside.",1363546770

For all of my professional experience, so little of it has helped me prepare for the challenges of building Earbits.  My co-founder is one year older than me and his professional experience before Earbits was almost exclusively music production and composition.  Now, not only does he manage the music department of Earbits, but most of our sales, editorial content, accounting, and frankly, he is the yin to my yang that balances out Earbits in so many ways.<p>30 is a great age to start something new and significant.

It is a word that you decided to label yourself with, it's totally arbitrarily chosen and not based in reality if you really think about it.<p>Second , this is not your last chance.

Like every living organism, you are part of this infinitely complex ecosystem, proliferating, processing and modifying the light from a star. 
You are the spearhead of thousands of generations of winners at this game of life, who managed to transmit their strong features into the future with the ultimage goal of achieving a form of immortality.
If you look at yourself from this perspective, rather more important and deep then whatever number is associated with your bank acount in some SQL database on some server belonging to some bank, then the term 'sucess' or 'loser' is really unapplicable.<p>Likewise, success is a rather arbitrarily chosen label. Our society generally defines it as people who were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time and be born into the right parents and to have met the right people and to have been blessed with the right obsession (which we call talent) to become sucessful at increasing their financial and political score.<p>But this is just a small piece of the whole puzzle!<p>My sugestion is to really try to look at your spiritual side and try to realise what your other purposes (besides making money) really are.<p>Eventually, who you are is really what stories about yourself you believe in.<p>Oh, and your life is only just begining !",1363546369

I'm guessing the issue for Heroku is that that don't have 1 router/haproxy per app, and that 1 server can handle many dynamos/apps.<p>Heroku likely has their own custom routing software that communicates with their databases to route incoming requests to the correct dynamos, etc.<p>EDIT: Key problem with the 'at scale' part is that Heroku does not have a single router, they have many many routers. I don't work there, so I have no idea if/why a single HAProxy couldn't handle it all, but obviously it can't or they'd just do that and save money!<p>Using a HAProxy with 'maxconn' flag works only for that single router instance. If a request arrives at a different router, it has no knowledge that server is wants to route the request to is already processing a request. That knowledge is internal state in a different router.<p>The key here would be to communicate this state between all routers. As I thought in the OP, the correct way to handle this at scale is some form of multicast - across a 1gbps network, broadcasted status updates should account for a tiny percent of traffic/processing, yet allow intelligent routing that would decrease latency immensely.<p>So I guess the original question still stands: is there any router project that communicates state between multiple load balancers/routers to allow intelligent routing at scale ?<p>EDIT2: Here we go - looks like research is being done in this area.

First off, who cares if someone has your number on their physical wall? If you posted your phone number to a public site, it will receive a lot more exposure there than hanging on some persons wall. Also, they claim to only produce one piece of art per comment so really they are only adding one more venue for viewing the number to an infinite amount of exposure via the web. And most likely, the people that the phone number is being publicly displayed to on porn sites are the people you wouldn't want to have your number. So how about... if you don't want people to have free access to your number in connection with some dirty thing you said online, don't post your flipping number on a porn site with your dirty comment, you silly goose!<p>With regard to this being extortion, the ""erase a number from our database for 1000"" thing is a joke, whether intentional or not.

And if I plug the number of comments in their database, the number of people willing to buy one of these painting, and the number of places you and all of your aquaintences go that might publicly display the art in to my handy probability calculator, the odds that you or anyone you know would ever see the painting containing your phone number are 25 jagillion to 1. Not to mention that if you live in the US or anywhere outside of Italy really, the cost of shipping a 70x100cm canvas would be prohibitively expensive for many.

I think this is partly because I'm not good at selling myself. But I've been where you are, had the same thoughts over and over, only I have a few years on you and have some life experience to offer. Like a great number of people, I have changed careers multiple times. It's not a big deal. As of right now, I've got another 40-50 years to fill up that I don't relish spending in front of a television drooling on my bib.<p>I told myself the same thing in my 20s. It was data structures for me, not pointers. I remember thinking, I'm just not smart enough to write code. Man, no lie... I'm slow and these concepts are tough. What's different now is that I know a number of people who are willing to take time out of their busy days and explain stuff to me when I get stuck. Very few people build things alone. Even using a language to build a thing of value is going to leverage libraries and packages that someone else wrote.<p>If you feel like a loser and a loner, this tells me that you somehow feel isolated and that you don't feel like you have a peer group of like-minded people to associate with. For me, the internet has helped tremendously in this way. Many times you cannot talk to someone candidly in person, but you can do this online. The fix for this (which you seem to have already discovered) is to find some way to talk to people, and talk to a lot of people, until you've talked to enough people that at least one of them sees something valuable in you.<p>Honestly, the words ""This is my last chance get my life back on track,"" are melodramatic. Every day, people all over the world set different goals for themselves and learn new habits in order to meet those goals. If you are convinced you ""don't have much time left,"" you are setting yourself up for failure. How long do you think you will live? After you turn 30, then you turn 40. Then you turn 50. And so on. How many times will you screw up in those decades? Lots.

Dreaming is necessary but not sufficient for great accomplishments. Glad you're one of us.<p><i>I hardly ever tried - and when I tried, I didn't persist. It has been my goal to start a business since ever I can remember. And yet I never really tried (until last year, which resulted in abysmal failure). Not even something small, like selling stuff online. I was always good at dreaming up new ideas. But never executed on any one of them.</i><p>I am about to tell you a bunch of stuff, but this is the most important. You have to get this or you will never break out of your rut:<p>The reason you're stuck is because you're too focused on yourself. Remember, it's <i>not</i> about you. It's about others.<p>The reason for building great things is to help others achieve their goals. It's not about how rich you'll become, or how famous, or who will like you, or how much fun it will be. (Well maybe a little of that last one.) Until you find someone else who must have something, you will always quit when things get tough. And they always get tough. Having someone else (a customer, a user, someone...) is the key ingredient that many miss on the road to ""must build"". Find someone, then find something that you <i>have</i> to build. You won't want to disappoint someone who is depending on you. Believe me, in your case, this will probably make all the difference.<p><i>Likewise, I have been programming on and off since the age of 17. Unfortunately, I started out with C++. As soon as I hit pointers, I made up my mind that programming was only for people smarter than me.</i><p>There will <i>always</i> be someone smarter than you. DO NOT let that stop that from building what you must build. It's better to be junior than to be weak.<p><i>Somehow, I did get back into it a few years later, but I never really became proficient at it. Again, I was good at learning the basics, reading code, messing around with code snippets on the command line. But I never built anything of value.</i><p>Stop reading code. Stop messing around. Find something that needs to be built (preferably by someone other than yourself). Then build it. Trust yourself and trust the process of building. You <i>will</i> learn what you need when you need it. I promise.<p><i>I don't have too much time left. My 20ies are gone.</i><p>Bullshit. I didn't do my first startup until I was 32. Stop thinking like that. If you're a programmer, your prime is still 20 years ahead of you. (Believe me, I know.)<p><i>This is my chance to turn the boat around, and realize my goals.</i><p>Good. It's definitely not your last chance, but glad to see you're prepared to make the most of it.<p><i>So, this is meant as much for the rest of the world as it is meant for myself.</i><p>It better be. Until you realize that your work is for others, not yourself, you will continue to spin your wheels. The biggest byproduct of recognizing the needs of others is that you will automatically and subconsciously start solving your own problems as well.<p><i>Usually, I would have just signed up with yet another anonymous name. Not this time. I want to keep myself honest.</i><p>Good. Always be yourself. Who else are you going to be?<p><i>(unfortunately, besides being a loser, I'm also a loner).</i><p>You're not a loser, so get that disempowering thought out of your head forever. A loser would never have opened up like you just did. And if you are a loner, that's not unfortunate, it's probably normal. Maybe even necessary. You see, despite what people may think, the best software is still written by one person, alone with their thoughts. Embrace your lonerness!<p><i>For better or for worse.</i><p>There is no worse. What you <i>think</i> is worse are just speedbumps on the way to better. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you will see these things as what they really are: the feedback you need to get on track to get better.<p><i>This is my last chance to get my life back on track.</i><p>No it's not. (See above.)<p><i>If anyone else reads this, wish me good luck.</i><p>Fuck luck. Just quit you're stinkin' thinkin' and get to work.

Wealth and ""success"" did not solve their problems in the long run.<p>If you are really serious about changing your life, I strongly recommend taking up therapy with a therapist you respect and trust, and be prepared and committed to doing a lot of hard work on yourself, with their help.<p>Though CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)[1] and other short-term, ""evidence based""[2] therapies are very popular and nearly the only kind insurance companies want to pay for these days, I personally look at them as a superficial bandaids[3][4], and antidepressants as emergency tourniquetes at best.[5]  My own inclination is towards something like Logotherapy[6] (which focuses on helping you to find meaning in your life), Jungian[7], Transpersonal[8] and Humanistic[9] therapies.. so that's where I'd personally steer you to.<p>But whatever therapy you pick, it's most important to find a therapist you respect and trust.  If you can't respect and open up to your therapist, or if you can't commit to lots of often painful hard work with them (because looking deeply and honestly in to yourself is often painful and difficult), your time spent in therapy will be wasted.  Try as many therapists as you need to to find a good one.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine#Limitations_and_criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine#Limita...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine#In_psychiatry"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine#In_psy...</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant#Controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant#Controversy</a><p>[6] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logotherapy</a><p>[7] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology</a><p>[8] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology</a><p>[9] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology</a>",1363545424

This bug turned out to be there for years and nobody ever noticed it. The pitfall was that there was a constant reference to a template SQL string for doing the ordering, that was passed to an external plugin that filled the template with detailed data. Unfortunately, the plugin modified the string instead of making a copy, so the sorting criteria applied correctly only to the first user.

I did run after a lot of tech, new toys etc. Even though it is nice and many times important to know the new and emerging stuff, I accepted that it overwhelmed me and I have to narrow down a bit. So, I started learning a (only one) new language and chose Python because it seemed easier to focus of the task at hand with Python and not get drowned in gory details of the tool.<p>I figured that I will work on what I like rather than what is or will be 'cool' after 4 years of this struggle. There were humanitarian projects I had thought of as a junior in college that never saw the light of day. I have begun those. It makes me happy to work on things that I want to work on, rather than what can become a great business. At least that's a start. I have started thinking in terms of how can I deliver a great product to my users from the idea I have and love.<p>Don't get me wrong, I am still learning. I have to make a mental note every hour of the day to not compare, not get distracted. My physical therapist told me that one has to make a mental note of their posture. That is termed as ""body mechanics"". I think that that goes with our minds too. You have to keep training yourself to stay positive by little tricks like avoiding comparison, recognizing what you want to do and accepting reality etc.<p>Maybe not the best advice but my 2 cents.<p>Good luck!",1363544637

5390329,comment,5390138,5390138,1,0,angkec,,,"I can relay to this. I'm like you, starting things but can't persist. I grow tired and frustrated easily from mundane works such as make a pretty landing page, beef up our application's UI etc. Anything that requires 40+ hours of working is like a sea of burden to me.<p>However I had the great opportunity of having an awesome co-founder. He seems to be picking up where I left and finishes them off beautifully. Server side coding? check. Server side UI remake? check. Landing page details? check. I grew very interested in the fact that facing the same amount and type of work, why can he persist and why not me?<p>I think I had the answer this morning after quite of few months of introspection. The difference between me and him is that I look at how things were supposed to be, while he looks at how things could be. Let me make an example.<p>Remember the old story that half a glass of water can be both viewed as still a half remaining or a half missing, generating different moods? Well my tiny story is a twist to it. Say you were to fill a bigger glass with a tiny ink converter. Let's say it will take about 2hrs of mind-numbing work. After one hour with half a glass, I would look at the task and say, oh my, still a half to go. How grueling can this be? Then I'd feel frustrated and give up. Just like what I did to many of the tasks I started but never finished. My co-founder, I suspect, will look at the remaining work and say, oh my, only one more hour to go then I'll have this wonderful filled glass of water! That's why he stays up and working and never seems to have burn outs. I guess positive emotions never gives you burn outs. It is persisting under negative emotions gets you burn outs.<p>So I'm guessing the key is to catch yourself thinking in a bad way that is generating negative emotions, then turn the thinking in a better way that generates positive emotions.<p>I just realized this this morning. There should be a few points that I'm missing but I think I'll figure more out in the coming days/weeks. Meanwhile I am logging my thoughts and see if I can turn my emotions around and if that makes a (at least) personal difference. Hope it is useful for you.",1363544621

Still I do believe the tax would have a significant positive impact on the economy.<p>The tax would most effect arbitrage trades. Arbitrageurs get between buyers and sellers. When a seller offers a stock for $95 and a buyer is willing to pay $105 the arbitrageurs buy the stock for $95 and sell it to the buyer for a premium (~ $102.5). Arbitrageurs have trading algorithms which can do this millions of times per second, that's how they can buy faster than the ""real"" buyer. They behave like vultures fighting for the scraps (so to speak) and getting in the way of ""real"" market participants.<p>The act of arbitrage trades is taxing market participants already. The proposed tax of 3 might make buying stock cheaper on average. (I don't know the real numbers, this is just a guess)
Further more I would rather see the money in the hand of the government, as there is a chance that some of the money is spend on better streets & health care. The alternative is to fund hoards of highly skilled engineers to improve algorithm that pick up the scraps. I personally know engineers at broker firms who feel their extremely well paid job provides absolutely no good to society.<p>EDIT: The main argument for the existence of arbitrageurs is that they provide liquidity to the market when there are not enough buyers & sellers. My personal believe is, they liquidity they provide today comes with a to high of a price. 20 years ago when it was a few guys yelling on the trading floor you could always count on one guy yelling (the arbitrageur). Today the number of market participants & electronic transactions make trades near perfect; The utility of arbitrage trades vanished almost completely.",1363543310

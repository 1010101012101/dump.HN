(Enron, Halliburton and Dick Cheney don't have a good reputation on these parts). And I'm certain there will be some mud on the Democrats' side as well afterwards.<p>In Uruguay we do have some problems with high-level corruption, but it's the low level small things that put us on a slightly lower level than the US.",1288177006

The degree to which it does, however, is up to you.<p>My wife and I waited 'til we were both 30 to have kids (we had been married since we were 24).  Because we waited, we decided that we'd go all in when we did have kids--one of us would be at home with the kids, and likely homeschool (which we are doing).  We made the commitment to change our lives in order to be parents.  We weren't going to shoehorn kids into our lifestyle.<p>Additionally, be ready to sacrifice your time for your partner/spouse's sake, especially during infancy.  Both parents need some time away, particularly if one is at home with the child.  Early on, I considered my time at work my ""free time,"" and was willing to give up trips to the climbing gym in the evenings so that my wife could get out of the house.  As I said, this is only temporary, and as your kids get older, it's easier to share what you love with them (that's why we've never stopped climbing since we had kids--we can easily do it together, and the many road trips have provided lots of bonding experiences).<p>Another thing I've come to realize is that raising your children really is a way to make a positive contribution to the world.  The work you do as a parent is profoundly important, more so than any hacking project or start-up.  You <i>will</i> have time for your own big ideas again, so don't waste the opportunity you have with your kids.",1288176955

I don't want to get into the details here, but your assumption that having your strings in one encoding composed conceptually of code points in a different encoding is not necessarily the way to go. I was on a JCP expert committee that rejected that option for Java, but that doesn't mean it <i>couldn't</i> end up best for Arc. It's just not as easy a decision as you imply. There are alternative approaches with different pros and cons, and since these abstractions all leak, you need to make a cross-implementation decision so that you don't end up with different coding practices on different platforms. Plus all the other issues that Unicode presents that make parsing a challenge that might have implications for a language that is famous for parsing and rewriting its own source at runtime.... These could all be worked out through a vigorous discussion process among a diverse group large enough to make sure that the implications of each approach are understood, but Graham doesn't work that way.",1288176242

But after a while you always run into the things the author describes.  There are simply no options out there that can compete with a simple CMS that you build from scratch.<p>Keep it simple, as in, a few textareas that accept HTML and spit it out verbatim.  Deal with all the SEO bits such as good urls, meta descriptions, etc. so that it works in the correct way.  Incorporate it into your actual site shell, as opposed to trying to create a fragile little WordPress theme that sorta looks like your site.  Make it modular enough that you can drop it into every new project you do from here on out.<p>It'll take you two days to do this.  If it takes longer, you're overengineering.  Stop and redesign from scratch for the whole thing to live in two tables with a half dozen fields each.  You don't need a little tree structure where you can drag nodes around, jQuery style.  You just need a table full of content and a way to display it.<p>From there, it's maybe a few hours per existing site to rip out the garbage CMS you're currently using and retrofit yours in its place.

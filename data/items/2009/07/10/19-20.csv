698266,comment,697826,698166,0,0,sho,,,"With redundancy, basically. But there's not much ""downtime"" with mail servers, it's not like web servers where they're always being updated with the latest code and the app server needs restarting. Any admin worth his salt should be able to guarantee very good uptime (barring HW/power/network failure) for mail under normal/medium load conditions; high load has its own challenges but that's a separate issue. Of course, real 100% uptime means multiple machines at multiple sites, cue standard cost/benefit analysis.<p>And it's also important to bear in mind that it's an SMTP server; unless it's actually your users trying to connect directly it will be other mail servers talking to it. If you're down for a while, they will queue at their end and retry periodically. You'd have to be down for days to lose mail, although your users might get warning notices, which might look unprofessional.<p>One thing you could do to get the benefit of having your own server, while keeping the gmail redundancy, is simply set gmail to forward all those messages to you. If you went down, they'd just build up until you were back up, and that way you could avoid users ever getting those embarrassing failure notices.<p>I think Lamson looks awesome, btw. I started an SMTP server in Ruby before but gave up in horror when I started having to actually read those hideous RFCs. Shaw certainly has a knack for getting the dirty work done. A real mail server is a <i>horrible</i> job to write. He should be given a govt grant or something to do this shit.<p>(edited to sound less like an asshole, unfortunately not before OP had replied .. sorry >_<)",1247255919

698247,comment,696652,696652,0,0,schizoidboy,,,"The ""thread dump"" feature should be an absolute requirement for any language runtime environment. Java has perfected this with the SIGQUIT signal. Thread dumps give you readable stacks of all threads with a simple user command (kill -3 on Linux/Unix, although a bit more difficult on Windows), without having to install symbol files, install additional software, run ""scary"" commands (for end users), etc.<p>This is a textbook example of taking a few thread dumps, a few minutes apart, immediately showing what is going on. IBM has one of these as their Performance or Hang ""MustGather"" script:<p><a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21115785&aid=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21115785&#3...</a><p>.NET thread dumps suck -- you have to use adplus to attach and they're not easy to read. Native programs (e.g. C/C++) work better with symbols and are just too scary for end users. DTrace on Solaris with Ruby/Python/PHP extensions is nice, but too cumbersome to install, and again too scary for end users.<p>I'm not aware of built-in thread dumps-by-signal in other non-Java languages (please note in a comment if there is), but this feature is so basic and needs to be baked in to every runtime environment and easy enough for end users to use.<p>Firefox, being a native program, is in a bad problem determination position here and the haphazard nature of the problem determination process in the forum and bug report shows that. I suggest Firefox create something like IBM's MustGather scripts (starting with a performance one such as IBM's hang MustGather -- <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21115785"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21115785</a> [click ""Show Details"" for the steps]). A hang MustGather should go through the process of installing symbol files, getting the thread stacks, submitting the information, etc. This will allow users to at least feel like they can do something valuable to help the developers fix the problem.",1247255413

Variable attributes table not only gives you a lot of application flexibility but also helps performance in that you're not polluting your primary  table with extraneous metadata columns that are hardly ever referenced. It doesn't surprise me that DB programmer would look at that and be offended that it's not purely referential -- not everything that happens in a database has to be referential to everything else. Sometimes databases are just dumb data stores. Not all problems are solved by ""referential integrity""",1247253631

To me, Google represents everything on the <i>web</i>, all of the odd links and connections between people who want to communicate, be heard, get feedback about their ideas, etc.  It actually did make a lot of sense for it to release a web browser.<p>So even though its basic mission is something like ""To organize the world's information, digitally,"" I don't know if that should really extend into the private sphere.  \nThere is a lot of private data that people want/need to keep offline.  Separating its over-arching ""www"" mission from its hyper-aware ""blanket snapshot"" of all the live pages on the web would be really tough.<p>It'd be heading in the direction of Microsoft, where when you go buy a new PC at the store, and they include all those stupid-annoying icons glued to the desktop.<p>I'm probably a bit biased because to me, an OS [<a href=""http://oss.zentu.net/?q=forum/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oss.zentu.net/?q=forum/1</a>] should be like the local agent, there to help me have more control over what the Internet and its many ports have access to, on my local machines, at any particular time.<p>This lack of divide (the Microsoft OSes and IE browsers) and the lack of <i>separation of control</i> by one business to so many facets of a person's private data is one of the primary reasons MS was targeted for anti-trust issues.<p>Anyway, if Google does end up releasing a truly open-source OS, I might possibly link to it in the directory. . . (the Chrome web browser is already linked).  But taking into consideration the number of OSes already out there (37 in my directory alone w/a few more in queue), it doesn't seem like the wisest choice or business move.<p>Besides, with all of the new offerings and ""stuff"" it is working on, doesn't it already have enough on its plate?  For such a relatively young company, it seems like they might be attempting to take on a little too much.  Healthy growth life cycles and all.",1247253398

For example, I know a number of management consultants who work for the big brand name consultancies. They travel each week to work at their client's site, and usually stay at classy hotels: the Ritz, Four Seasons, etc., and the clients don't care because they already spend $X million on consultants, so who cares if they're spending $500 a night per person for hotel costs? Besides, they're advising the board, or the president and C-suite, so there's no point in worrying about costs.<p>But Wal-Mart cared. The consultants had to stay at cheap hotels. (For these people, that was traumatizing.) Their receipts were reviewed and per diem spending caps enforced. (Very uncommon. These people like to rack up $1,000 bar tabs and charge it to the client.) Most of the team did not even fly down there, to save costs. (Seems obvious, but that's not usually done.) That made them an unpopular client among the jet set, but they sure saved a lot of money.",1247253147

1267412,comment,1266619,1266619,0,0,gjm11,,,"That's beautiful.<p>For anyone who's wondering: why a 17-gon? the answer is an astonishing theorem: with the traditional Euclidean tools of ruler and compass, you can construct an n-sided polygon if and only if n is the product of a power of 2 (1,2,4,8,...) and some set of ""Fermat primes"": prime numbers of the form 2^2^n+1 (2,3,5,17,65537, and no one knows whether there are any more but there probably aren't). You aren't allowed to use any of the Fermat primes more than once.<p>So you can construct a regular heptadecagon but not a regular nonagon or a regular heptagon.<p>Why? Here's a super-handwavy sketch of the ideas involved. Points in the plane are complex numbers. Constructing a regular n-gon is like constructing z = exp(2 pi i / n). That satisfies the equation z^n=1. We only need to consider prime-power values of n, because if m,n have no common factor then you can do mn if and only if you can do m and n. (Proof left as an exercise for the reader.) For such n, it's not hard to figure out the <i>minimal</i> polynomial in z whose value is 0; when n is prime, e.g., it's z^(n-1) + z^(n-2) + ... + z + 1.<p>Now, imagine doing any ruler-and-compass construction you like. Start with two points, which we'll call 0 and 1. Then every individual construction you can do involves solving either a linear or a quadratic equation. Conversely, you can solve any quadratic equation by doing ruler-and-compass constructions. (Details again left as an exercise; or look it up.)<p>Now think about those ""minimal polynomials"" for all the numbers you construct along the way. The degree of such a polynomial (i.e., the highest exponent it contains) is an important quantity. It turns out (super-handwavy, again) that when you solve a quadratic equation with coefficients whose minimal polynomials have degree d, you get something whose minimal polynomial has degree d or 2d. So at any stage in your ruler-and-compass construction, all the degrees are powers of 2. In particular, you can never construct anything whose minimal polynomial has degree that isn't a power of 2. And <i>that</i> is enough to tell you that when n is a power of a prime number, you can't construct a regular n-gon unless n is a power of 2 or a Fermat prime.<p>The other direction is conceptually easier but fiddlier, and I shan't try to explain it here.",1271325202

I couldn't play it for more than a couple of hours.<p>Two games I relate to on the theme of navigation of space are the Thief series, and Far Cry 2.<p>With Thief, you have a rough map, and your task is to navigate the territory to get to your goals, avoiding hazards such as loud tile and metal, bright lights, guards, traps etc. With a selection of arrows for making the ground silent, extinguishing torches, and rope arrows for climbing, it can be a lot of fun. Constantine's Mansion (Constantine's Sword mission) is a particularly architectural delight, with optical illusions and a network of grassy tunnels joining different floors.<p>Actually, a defining metaphor of the first two Thief games is architecture as sexuality; in the first, your enemy is the earthy Pagan Trickster and his co-conspirator, wood nymph Viktoria, and you pursue him into the bowels of the earth. In the second, your enemy is a technocratic religious self-described prophet, and you pursue him in a monstrous skyscraper of metal, working your way up and up.<p>Similarly, a substantial and (for me at least) entertaining part of Far Cry 2 relates to the navigation between mission objectives. The roads are patrolled, and intersections are heavily enough guarded that clearing them risks depleting ammo, so the best policy is generally to navigate in the gaps between the roads, choosing crossing points, swimming in rivers, selecting the right angle of entry approach for mission destinations, etc. Given that every main mission involves at least three different destinations (one to your buddy in a safehouse, one to the buddy's preferred mission target, and a third as the original mission), you need to enjoy this navigation to get the most out of the game. (Most people didn't; it seems they stuck to the roads and found the guard checkpoints tedious.)<p>As to games like Half-Life and its successors in particular, they seem to me to inhibit exploration and be very linear. Any time there's an interesting passage hidden away in a corner, I make a note of it and scout out ahead to see what the mainstream alternative is; but in HL2 and episodes, it usually turns out that the main branch is a dead end, and you <i>must</i> go back and investigate that hidden passage. So it kills any chance of you feeling clever, and makes the unorthodox mundane.",1271322486

And even in the case of YC, if I were to advise a budding pair of young entrepreneurs, I'd tell them to move back in with their parents for a year, get a low skill but high paying job to give them sustenance money (e.g., bartend or barista), and focus on implementing their idea. There are nice YC value adds like being introduced to influential folks. But part of being a business person is finding a way to get to these folks anyway. Why pay for this service when you can get them for free?<p>So many startup folks are attracted to these kinds of programs because I think they mimic the illusion of safety that school offered. You have to be ""accepted"" and it's not a venture but a ""program"". Everything is geared towards creating this sense of safety without pointing out you are giving up a lot for it. Know why these programs want to save you the hassle of doing your own incorporation paperwork that took me a day to figure out when I was a teenager? Because they have to put clauses in that will help them, not you.<p>Again, I'm not saying these ventures are sinister. But you can get by without them and in fact may become a better business person for it.",1271322159

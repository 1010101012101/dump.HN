Creativity defines the world we live in. He defines creativity as ""the process of coming up with original ideas that have value."" Just think about that. Everything in the world that we use and take for granted is the result of some creative person somewhere taking a risk. The importance of creativity is the most undervalued characteristic of people in the world. We focus more on SAT and ACT scores, both of which are only a fraction as important.",1289537824
1896575,comment,1896122,1896490,0,0,tokenadult,,,"In current psychological literature, the term ""genius"" is developing a generally accepted definition. Psychologist Dean Keith Simonton is the leading author on the subject. The basis idea is that a genius is someone who performs at a level that is reliably superior in a statistical sense (that is, an ""expert"" in the terminology of K. Anders Ericsson) AND produces a new paradigm of performance in the domain of performance.<p>Comment on the submitted article: the Mozart biographical materials I have read suggest that Mozart's sister didn't reach Wolfgang's high level of performance partly because their father really did have a child in whom more was invested, consistent with sexist attitudes of the time. After edit: I guess the author of the essay has ten years to learn how to write a well researched essay on a topic that is well sourced in the standard scientific literature.",1289537793

Accepting a $3.5 million counter-offer means that the immediate ""sure thing"" is greater than or equal to the expected value of Facebook's offer when the risk of Facebook falling short is taken into account.  Say this engineer thought there was only a 50% chance of Facebook actually hitting their ""quietly told"" market cap.  That would imply the Facebook offer was something in the $5-$7 million range, or 1/15000th to 1/20000th of the outstanding shares.  For recruiting a big name, this is much more plausible amount to offer than the 1/10 of 1% in the story.<p>If the story is true, then I'd bet that the engineer is someone who came to Google late (or at the wrong time), probably is pretty comfortable with his standing at Google is someone fairly prominent, and is more comfortable taking  a stable, sure thing than taking a risk on a situation as early in the company life-cycle as Facebook is.

8099965,comment,8098238,8099241,2,0,apu,,,"The Viola-Jones technique is still fairly competitive for face detection performance, IF you train it with a lot of data (and of course <i>good</i> data, which means with all the types of variations you expect to see). However, the pre-trained classifier provided with OpenCV is terrible (unless they&#x27;ve updated it recently).<p>Fortunately, OpenCV provides functions to train your own classifier using your own data, so if you can get good data, and are willing to wait for the week or two it&#x27;ll take to process, you can get much better performance using the same technique.<p>Finding sufficient training data (labeled faces) is more tricky. For an automated approach, you could try bootstrapping it by simply running a more state-of-the-art detector (such as on Facebook, Google, etc.) and feedings the outputs into the training function (you&#x27;ll need to do some work to actually get the outputs programmatically, perhaps through undocumented APIs).<p>Another approach is to use an existing face dataset. One possibility is the FDDB [1] although it&#x27;s kind of small (5171 faces). Unfortunately, most other datasets I know of in the face community are either unrealistic images (e.g., only &quot;mugshot&quot;-style) or were detected using OpenCV (and thus won&#x27;t help you get better).<p>The final approach is to label images yourself, which would require time and money (e.g., to do it on Amazon Mechanical Turk).<p>If you do decide to retrain classifiers, it&#x27;s essential that you augment your data in various ways, such as by mirroring images (and labels) left/right, generating slightly rotated versions of faces, and at slightly different sizes. This augmentation can GREATLY improve the performance of your detector.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/index.html</a>",1406591684

Most of the pure recreational fleet could burn an unleaded version of the current 100LL. That wouldn&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; the problem though.<p>I&#x27;d love nothing more than to see a safe, usable, unleaded aviation fuel emerge from the morass that is the FAA approval process.<p>I want an unleaded replacement fuel as much for the sustainability of the necessary part that general aviation plays in the economy as for the ecological issues. There is only one chemical plant in the world that makes TEL today. We are quite possibly one significant industrial accident away from having the fuel supply disrupted.<p>I believe 9 candidate unleaded fuels were submitted to 1 testing avenue, though I think that the most promising fuel, G100UL, was not submitted to that testing process. Presumably GAMI (the creator of the G100UL) has some alternative certification process that they&#x27;re intending. I do know that the Shell, Swift, and GAMI fuels have flown a fair amount in experimental airplanes already. That&#x27;s a technical categorization. The airplane itself was probably mechanically indistinguishable from the certified airplane, but was placed into the experimental category specifically in order to test its flight characteristics with the new fuel. A certified airplane cannot legally fly on non-certified fuel (or with non-certified radios, autopilot, non-certified diesel engine, etc). Convert that same certified airplane to experimental, put the required placards on it, and you can fly it with the non-certified fuel.<p>To address the &quot;why don&#x27;t you just burn car gas?&quot; question: the high-compression and/or turbo-charged engines typical in the working airplanes require an octane rating higher than currently available car gas or unleaded aviation fuel. Most (some estimates are over 80%), of the low and mid-performance piston engined airplanes could burn 94UL (the current ASTM D910 standard 100LL just without the lead added at the end of the process).<p>The relatively low percentage of the fleet which cannot burn 94UL is unfortunately the portion of the fleet that flies the most hours and burns the most fuel. Estimates are that this 20-25% of the fleet burns 60% or more of the fuel. These are the freight haulers, charter operators, CapeAir and other island hoppers, Alaska mail/grocery/fish/charter ops, firefighting water bombers, small business aircraft, and high-performance family airplanes. (That last category doesn&#x27;t burn near as much as the planes that fly everyday on working missions, of course.)<p>I sympathize with the FAA a lot, as the standard (ASTM D910) for the fuel they&#x27;re looking to replace is a chemical makeup standard and not a performance standard. The standard literally dictates that it contains a certain amount of tetraethyl lead (TEL), rather than dictating certain performance characteristics. Therefore, it&#x27;s just as impossible to create a &quot;standards conforming fuel without lead&quot; as it would be to create &quot;water without the wetness&quot;.<p>So, why can&#x27;t we just have airports start selling the 94UL at least to those planes that can use it?<p>Two reasons:\n1. Aviation fuel is already a low-volume fuel, and requires special handling all the way from refinery to dispensing station. If you believe that 94UL sales would only be 1/3rd of the current fuel sales, you now need a duplicative system of trucks, tanks, and dispensers for a volume of sales that&#x27;s 1/3rd of the current, already low volume. The economics of that are daunting to say the least, on a per-gallon-dispensed basis. Airplanes are, by definition, mobile. If 94UL costs more than 100LL due to low-volume of sales, airplanes will fly to a field that sells 100LL. You can&#x27;t readily (practically) ban the sales of 100LL to airplanes that could use 94UL, because you don&#x27;t want airplanes taking off from airports that only sell 100LL with inadequate fuel and crashing from fuel exhaustion.<p>2. If an airport were to decide to take their existing single avgas storage tank and switch it over to 94UL, they&#x27;d be turning away 2/3rds of their business. If they decide to keep the single dispenser selling 100LL, they can sell to everyone. Again, the economics are compelling in favor of a single fuel solution for all piston airplanes.<p>I happen to believe in G100UL, but I&#x27;m not sure I see the clear path to getting any of them approved.",1406590362

A, and an interpreter implemented in lang. B. Now if you want the interpreter (in B) to interpret the program, you need some structured data to come from the parser (in A). Abstract syntax trees (ASTs) are the usual conceptual tool for this. Now assume that the parser outputs an AST that is described by something, like for example an algebraic data type (ADT). Assume that the structure of the ADT conforms to some type protocol. Now the interpreter can implement the ADT in its language (B) and thereby take the ADT directly as input.

And automated config generation can arguably be <i>more</i> error-prone.<p>Automation/orchestration should not simply make things happen automatically. It should make things work more reliably, and require less expertise to do so.

The actions layer specifically seems unnecessary as it could be implemented at the Store / model layer. The dispatcher is an event queue system with support for dependencies.<p>To me it makes a lot more sense for React components to push an event directly onto a pubsub event queue which then dispatches accordingly. When data changes anywhere it fires an event that then passes new state to the top level React component. Most of the actions you do to data are boilerplate and can be greatly simplified from Flux.<p>What am I missing? Why is it so complex?",1406588938

There are no shortcuts, especially when you&#x27;re an adult that cannot afford to spend as much time as a younger (because of work, family, etc).<p>To answer the question (the thing I wished I had known), I would advise you to start by learning anything that will help you for your whole career. It may be boring at first, but on the hindsight, it will be very rewarding.<p>To be more specific:\n- Learn to type on a keyboard. Really. I wish I had course about touch typing when I was younger (got to learn alone), and when I look around me, I notice many people still don&#x27;t know how to type.<p>- Learn Vi/Vim. Same as above. Vim is spread everywhere, is powerful and the principles behind it are strong. Vi exists for nearly 30 years, and won&#x27;t disappear before a very long time.<p>- Learn to work on a Linux/Unix/BSD environment. Even if you do not use it on a daily basis.<p>- Start with a language well established (well, do not start with C++ though). Not because they are better, but they have stood the test of time, are likely to be still there for some years, and, more importantly, you&#x27;ll find quality resources/books that will help you when you&#x27;ll stumble on a difficulty.<p>- Finish what you start.

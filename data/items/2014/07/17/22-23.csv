Similar enough to goto.com/overture&#x27;s idea, of search <i>purely</i> for ads. You&#x27;re far more likely to pay attention, to click, to buy. And it&#x27;s sustainable indefinitely because net-better for the world.<p>Although, judging from advertising in general, it may be better for advertisers to get your attention whether you want it or not. And they are the ones who decide whether the advertising occurs.<p>But if another company did ad-relevance better than Google, more efficiently (cheaper) and effectively (clicks, sales), it seems that Google couldn&#x27;t beat them, because the revenue at first would be lower and Google is Wall St-committed to increasing revenues. They would have to acquire the new company (if they could).<p>Unfortunately, ad-relevance requires data about the person, and Google is best placed for this (alongside Facebook). Despite the privacy-backlash, people increasingly live online and accept the loss of privacy. So, instead, we have startups with new ways to gather new personal data, and are acquired by Google/Facebook.",1405637804

8050695,comment,8049758,8049758,1,0,kingmanaz,,,"I&#x27;m a full time dvorak typist after years of having used qwerty. I re-learned vim&#x27;s shortcuts for dvorak. The transition took approximately one month. My wrist used to ache after 10+ hours a day typing querty. The fire finally died after I switched and became comfortable with dvorak.<p>My first impression when revisiting qwerty is a revulsion at the placement of the &quot;t&quot;. What a horrible location for such an oft used key. However, most qwerty users will have a similar response when typing &quot;ls -l&quot; on dvorak. Actually, a lot of unix commands were clearly written with qwerty in mind, their letters centering on qwerty&#x27;s home row. The unix monikers get easier with repetition for dvorak typists, but dvorak&#x27;s true power comes in writing English, which in my case is most of my typing. Vim works well with either layout, luckily. Most of the programming languages I use - SQL, golang, python, and c# - seem about the same in either layout.<p>Once you become fluent with dvorak it &quot;rolls&quot; off your fingers. You&#x27;ll know what I mean once you&#x27;re there. &quot;The&quot;, &quot;another&quot;, &quot;masticate&quot;, &quot;friend&quot;, and most other words with vowels and common consonants spend most of their typed lives on the home row. Both hands share evenly in typing. The common punctuation and quotes are right where you need them.<p>If you use RDP for most of your remote work the transition is surprisingly easy. Switching between layouts is simple in Windows and Unix. Hell, even my copy of Amiga 3.1 supports dvorak out of the box.<p>Some here seem to switch their keycaps to a dvorak arrangement. I did this in the past with my Model M but eventually set it back to querty. I&#x27;m not embarrassed to admit that I need to look at the keyboard now to type qwerty, thus having the keycaps set to querty serves as a convenient reminder. When typing dvorak I never look down.",1405637470

However, I do see that I left out an important piece of that: see below.<p><i>> If you take the space and earth out of the galaxy into empty space, the result would be very much the same</i><p>Yes, because empty space has a similar time translation symmetry, as long as the Earth is at rest in it. If the galaxy is included, the Earth has to be at rest relative to the galactic center of mass; I see now that I was implicitly assuming that it was, without saying so (I did hint at it when I commented about the Earth also rotating around the galactic center, but too slowly to make a difference). So you&#x27;re right that the galaxy itself isn&#x27;t really relevant; but the underlying time translation symmetry is.<p>The point is that what makes the Earth observer in these scenarios have the longest proper time is the fact that he is the one who is &quot;at rest&quot; with respect to the underlying time translation symmetry of the spacetime. Acceleration only comes into it because that is the particular mechanism you chose to make the space ship move relative to that time translation symmetry. In flat spacetime (which is essentially the idealization you&#x27;re adopting here), accelerating is the <i>only</i> way to move relative to the underlying time translation symmetry. But this does not generalize: there are plenty of examples in curved spacetime where unaccelerated observers can be the ones with shorter elapsed proper time, because they are moving with respect to an underlying time translation symmetry.",1405635492

With crowdfunding, we the people get to choose what things we want instead of publishers - which does mean we take the risks in case it misses the mark, and that is a very <i>real</i> risk.<p>I backed this one myself; a little bit, basically to see what happened. I like YOGS (back to when I played right alongside them on WoW, actually - small world!). They&#x27;re always looking for another fun platform to play/tell stories with. The developer/s were inexperienced; although it wasn&#x27;t quite clear just <i>how</i> green they were, I was aware that this one was looking a bit wobbly, as I&#x27;d never heard of them, and I <i>was</i> getting Molyneux vibes from the promises.<p>After I saw the alpha and beta, it was clear Winterkewl just couldn&#x27;t deliver the goods to anything resembling a reasonable quality, which is why Yogscast didn&#x27;t feel comfortable really going forward with it like that any more.<p>Pity about the lead dev&#x27;s marriage. Isn&#x27;t the first marriage killed by game development; won&#x27;t be the last. Obviously the studio is bankrupt (or to the extent that it isn&#x27;t, needs to refund).<p>Interesting to see Yogscast did at least get the source and assets out of the ruins of this project (although they&#x27;re not very <i>good</i> assets, unless you really want a dwarf beard simulator), and they seem to have some kind of rescue plan with another studio. Let&#x27;s see what happens.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure no-one&#x27;s swimming in half a million quids&#x27; worth of Jaffa cakes out of this one - but that&#x27;s development. Sometimes it goes like this and goes nowhere. Sometimes (like Elite: Dangerous, which is turning out <i>brilliant</i>) it goes to the stars.<p>I&#x27;m actually glad <i>we</i> can choose to take these risks with crowdfunding.

This is based on my observations of what I see myself and other people using Google for, not any inside information (I worked in Search, and they generally kept me away from the Ads numbers).<p>People use desktop search to research big-ticket items: cars, vacations, mortgages, life insurance, mesothelioma, consumer electronics, etc.  There&#x27;s a lot of value in a sale there.  A personal-injury lawyer may collect hundreds of thousands of dollars from a client with a solid case.  As a result, these keywords get bid up really high, because the profit potential of a new customer is high.<p>People currently use mobile search for day-to-day local needs.  What restaurant should I go to?  Where can I find parking?  What&#x27;s there to do in this town?  Most of these have sale prices in the $10-50 range, and so there&#x27;s just not as much money coming out of the sale.  As a result, the keywords don&#x27;t get bid up as high, and CPC is lower.<p>These use cases are not substitutes.  Just because people are searching for restaurants does not mean they aren&#x27;t <i>also</i> searching for mesothelioma.  We see this in the revenue numbers, which continue to rise.  But as a percentage of the total addressable market, high-value keywords like insurance and lawsuits will shrink as the market becomes larger.  If you&#x27;re looking at aggregate CPC numbers this will look like Google is becoming less attractive to advertisers, but what&#x27;s actually happening is that <i>Google is becoming viable for less attractive advertisers</i>.  The total market size is expanding, and with that come more marginal customers.<p>This, BTW, is one reason why I think Wall Street analysts are idiots.  They pay attention to the wrong metrics, because those are the only numbers they have to pay attention to.  I have my own set of metrics that I use to judge when it&#x27;s time to sell Google stock, but I&#x27;m not going to reveal them here.",1405634665

Basically, classical stenotype and other similar syllabic two-hand chording systems are a big bag of hurt, and probably not well-suited for anything except transcribing spoken English (or whatever natural language your steno system is designed for). A more orthographic system like Velotype <a href=""http://www.velotype.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.velotype.com/en/</a> / Veyboard <a href=""http://www.veyboard.nl/en_main.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.veyboard.nl/en_main.html</a> is probably better unless you need to optimise for the last iota of transcription speed in one specific spoken language, especially since most of us will never reach professional real-time transcription speeds no matter what keyboard we use. (And OTOH, Velotype is apparently fast enough to be in use for real-time tasks in the Netherlands.)<p>EDIT: Also, most people would probably be better served doing something about the time they spend moving their right hand between keyboard and mouse than increasing their typing speed.",1405634438

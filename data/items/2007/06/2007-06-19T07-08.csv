People like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Henry Ford, etc.<p>People on a Board of Directors fire superstars because they're hard to control and hire losers that are ""team players"". Just because they implement the theory so horribly doesn't mean it's not a valid one.<p>I wouldn't look to Japanese companies for any pointers on staying innovative or disruptive. Japan is still all about the status quo, risk-aversion, and bureaucracy. They should be so much further along it's scary and it is hurting them: a superstar at Sony would have created the iPod.<p>",1182239701

29145,comment,29023,29023,0,0,Tichy,,,"I recently tried PickyDomains.com, which was a suggestion from news.ycombinator. My task was an ""umbrella page"" - I am tired of this domain name problem, so I figured I need something like google or yahoo - when they create a new service, they just create a subdomain (maps.google.com, answers.yahoo.com, whatever.google.com...).<p>What PickyDomains came up with is Artifia.com (since I mentioned artificial intelligence, I guess). So here is my question to news.yc: what do you think about that name? I am not a native speaker, so it is hard for me to judge (sounds good in German, not even sure how it would be pronounced in english). I think the name could grow on me.",1182237328

Distressful is that ruby and rails are by many people considered as the same thing. Those ROR versus PHP versus Java versus whatever-you-want are simply infantile. Please no flame and good luck :)",1182237109

Surprisingly many people only type the company name into the url field (without www or .com) - I think then they are at the mercy of msn search?",1182236937

Why do writers try to make it sound as if the fate of Apple and Steve Jobs would depend on it? Also was it such a huge investment for Apple? I don't think these days building a phone is that much of a problem, at least there are several companies who managed to do it before.",1182236533

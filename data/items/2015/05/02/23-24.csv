It was not uncommon for bare-knuckle boxing matches in the 1800s to go 30, 40, 50, even over 100 rounds, until someone collapsed in exhaustion or broke too many bones in their hands from badly-placed punches to the bonier parts of their opponent.",1430610944

9479020,comment,9478442,9478951,0,0,Swizec,,,"> Do you always spar with headgear, mostly with headgear, or never with headgear?<p>At my home gym in Ljubljana, Slovenia, Europe, we fight without head gear. When I&#x27;m in the US, they won&#x27;t let me spar without headgear because of liability issues.<p>Official amateur fights are with headgear. There has been talk about banning headgear in amateur fights for as long as I&#x27;ve been boxing (about 5 years).<p>My personal view is that for official fights, headgear is probably good. For sparring, it sucks. People punch like wild animals because hey, he&#x27;s got headgear, he&#x27;ll be fine. But it doesn&#x27;t cover the face much and a full-on blow to the face is, imho, against the spirit of sparring and training. Because of headgear people also care less about hooks[1] because hey, my headgear protects there. But rotationary forces cause the most concussions and damage to the brain[2].<p>But headgear is amazing at defending against cuts. Although in five years of boxing I&#x27;ve only got punched hard enough to get a cut once.<p>> Can a boxer make a living as a sparring partner?<p>Maybe, it depends. I make my living as a software engineer and keep boxing as a pure hobby. But I assume somebody like Mayweather would pay a lot for a really good sparring partner. He most likely would have no use for me, I&#x27;m not at that level.<p>The best fighters I&#x27;ve sparred were amateur kickboxing world champs in various tournaments. There is no money in that, but a lot of fun.<p>> How much is weight an advantage? Is 5 pounds massive, minor, or inconsequential?<p>I&#x27;m about 60kg (~135lbs) and have sparred people anywhere between 55kg (~120lbs) to 100kg (~220lbs). Most of my partners are in the 70-80kg range (155lbs - 180lbs).<p>When you&#x27;re doing gentlemanly sparring, weight doesn&#x27;t matter as much. You&#x27;re not trying to kill each other and if somebody sees they&#x27;re about to make a killer shot because you messed up your defence, they will hold it back and just tap you. Even as a lighter fighter, you would return said favor.<p>In a real fight, weight has a lot of advantage because it makes killer shots stronger.<p>But speed and arm-length are far more important. You would statistically come out on top if you always bet on the man with the longer arms.<p>Speed also more than compensates for weight.

It&#x27;s one of the things that made Ali special, he completely dominated the game in his younger years with speed and nimbleness that had scarcely been seen before in the heavyweight division. Then he went to jail because he famously refused to fight in Vietnam (&quot;No vietcong ever called me a ngr&quot;), which was quite brave as if he had served he&#x27;d be loved by the vast majority in the US, continued to box, and never have to fight or risk his life, as he would be doing boxing exhibitions for soldier morale, campaigning etc. He refused purely out of (political) ideology.<p>Anyway, all that aside, what I wanted to say is what made him special is that when he got out everyone considered him to be too slow. He changed, he wasn&#x27;t fast any longer, and older. Yet he was able to still dominate the weight class with a completely different style, at the expense of his body.<p>It&#x27;s not often we see that. Most fighters who lose their speed never stand a chance to even lesser fighters. It&#x27;s like Mayweather losing the shoulder roll and still dominating. And it surprised many at the time, it&#x27;s hard to imagine but Ali, unlike the champions we think of today (like tonights fight) went into many of his later fights as an underdog, the fight against Foreman being the most famous. Foreman was considered an absolute beast, knocking out within 2 rounds (brutally) people like Norton and Frazier, amazing fighters who Ali himself had already lost to. Add to that an Ali way past his prime who had lost his greatest asset: his speed. That was remarkable.<p>The Ali in your video against Williams was as great as the Ali against Foreman, but completely and totally different in style, strategy and capacity. It&#x27;s one of those things that don&#x27;t show up on the scorecards (of say a Mayweather, who never lost and has been a world champ for like 17 years in a row now, compared to Ali who retired with 5 losses), reasons for which most boxing experts don&#x27;t even have Mayweather in their top 20, no joke, while ali regularly makes a top 5, even though Mayweather is an absolutely brilliant fighter, too.<p>Thanks for the vid, good memories :)",1430609514

There is a much lower standard for a technical knockout. There are many stoppages that occur after &quot;flash&quot; knockouts, where the fighter is only unconscious for a brief moment.  Usually the fighter will protest, as he doesn&#x27;t even realize it&#x27;s happened.  In boxing, a flash knockout doesn&#x27;t end the fight, as long as the fighter gets back up.  In a boxing match, this could happen twice every round without ending the fight.<p>I also wonder if the ability to wrestle in MMA plays a role.  In boxing, as soon as the fighters clinch, the ref breaks up the fighters.  In MMA, it&#x27;s rare to see fighters stand within each other&#x27;s range and throw full powered punches for extended periods.",1430609270

Let&#x27;s take it easy on the echo chamber cliche here.<p>That&#x27;s my personal opinion based on personal experience. Feel free to attribute it to others but the echo chamber does not factor in there unless you wish to consider my office part of the echo chamber.<p>> Yeah, lots of bad apples out there,<p>Present company, as always, excluded.<p>> but ask any reasonable professional: a good recruiter is extremely valuable.<p>A good recruiter is a good recruiter for their paymaster. I&#x27;ve yet to see &#x27;reverse headhunting&#x27; where you submit your resume to a recruiter and they then go out to find the best possible position for you. So for now recruiters are exclusively working for companies looking to employ people.<p>> You did forget that there are 2 types of recruiters: agency (outside) and corporate (inside).<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with both, neither group to date has me particularly impressed. And I&#x27;ve dealt with them both as an employer <i>and</i> as someone who somehow made it onto the list of recruiters. Clueless wouldn&#x27;t begin to describe them, they used to have a joke saying that &#x27;those who can do, and those who can&#x27;t teach&#x27;, you could probably amend that with &#x27;and those that can&#x27;t teach recruit&#x27; and it wouldn&#x27;t be too far off the mark.<p>> I, the agency recruiter, do not want to &quot;dislodge&quot; the candidate for the minimum amount required. Not because my fee will be higher with a greater salary, but because I&#x27;m actually incentivized to do what is best for both the employer & employee.<p>And what is that?<p>> This is called sales.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly care about what you call it, to me it felt more like interacting with a class of buzz-word wielding vultures trying to make money from placing people based on an extremely limited understanding of what makes the tech world tick.<p>There are multiple ways to make money in any industry: you either dig for gold, you sell shovels to the miners or, in the case of the recruiters, you sell the miners to the mining company.<p>> When you do good by all parties to the transaction, it pays dividends long-term.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m sure it does. In the long term your loyalty <i>has</i> to lie with your repeat customer, the corporation that hires you. Since you are not going to get any repeat business from the individuals that you&#x27;ve placed (unless you&#x27;re willing to risk that long term relationship, but there are plenty of other recruiters that will be more than happy to play the game again).<p>> So, no, we&#x27;re not trying to &quot;snag&quot; them.<p>Said the fox to the chicken.<p>> I appreciate your paranoia, as you&#x27;re not alone; many people dealing with bad recruiters probably need to vent.<p>So, many people dealing with bad recruiters on the one hand..<p>> But for the most part, your perception of the recruiting industry is different from the reality.<p>And yet my perception is different from reality. That&#x27;s an interesting concept but I can&#x27;t fit both of those into my head without significant cognitive dissonance.<p>Either my experiences match those of others and the venting has - as you apparently confirm - a basis in fact <i>or</i> my perception (and by extension that of all the others complaining about their experiences with recruiters) is wrong. You can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>And you conveniently forgot to address the main point I made and instead latched on to my &#x27;perception issues&#x27;.",1430609260

First and foremost, he was using the glibc malloc, which belongs in a museum, not in a running system. One of rust&#x27;s big advantages in performance comes from that alone, given all the memory that&#x27;s being allocated and destroyed. Which leads to the second question of how he did allocate objects. He knew he was going to allocate a number of objects, yet he didn&#x27;t pre-allocate a large chunk of memory ahead of time to make it so he wouldn&#x27;t have to call malloc and friends as often. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if spending a bit of time just tuning memory didn&#x27;t cut significant time from how long execution takes. I really wonder how much time was spent in the system context of all three of those; I&#x27;d be willing to bet that the final part of the examination would probably fare much different had he used the same malloc for the C program that rust and go already use.",1430609099

With GraphQL, if you don&#x27;t automagically parse the filter out of the client code, you over-fetch. However, the HTTP/2 solution could just push the 2nd fetch as it was made by the co-executed client.<p>All that being said, GraphQL certainly alleviates the server-side load co-execution would imply and that&#x27;s likely more suitable to the scale Facebook operates at.",1430608421

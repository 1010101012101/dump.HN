You decrease success chance for higher yields. This is like business 101.<p>The advice &quot;do not base your business model on another company&quot; evaluates to &quot;do not increase your risks&quot; which would be an absolutely absurd advice.<p>If one qualifies the original statement with several conditions for different contexts, it may become a solid advice.

Some of the peering sites in the US are non profit, and as such these companies that own their own infrastructure are able to connect at-cost, or even at no cost [1].<p>I have no doubt that large companies take advantage of the above fact to get their internet &quot;free&quot; [2].<p>Now, there are still very significant costs in getting fiber to the peering sites, whether they trench it or lease it, and there are also the costs of the higher end routers, engineers to maintain them, etc. So, probably it is more cost effective to buy &quot;regular&quot; internet services for many small to medium office locations.<p>There is a decent article in Wired [2009] that explains how Google likely leverages all this to significantly reduce their bandwidth costs for YouTube [2].<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.phoenix-ix.net/aboutus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phoenix-ix.net/aboutus.html</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2009/10/youtube-bandwidth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2009/10/youtube-bandwidth/</a>",1428850757

This is one odd thing about Europe: in some ways it is left of the US, but in other ways quite right of the US. To take an example I&#x27;m familiar with in academia (I&#x27;ve worked in both American and Danish universities), Danish universities are more progressive in one sense: there is no tuition, education is free and universal. But in return, they are also much more shamelessly neoliberal about the goal of the university: the goal of universities is to increase the Danish GDP. Both their educational and research activities are measured by the extent to which they &quot;create value for Denmark&quot;. That view exists in the US too, but only the right wing really buys into it full stop, whereas in Denmark even the Social Democrats hold it, and have recently initiated a set of university reforms on that basis.",1428850280

9363455,comment,9362830,9363328,0,0,sparkie,,,">But global variables and SL are not the same thing as side-effects.<p>They&#x27;re examples of side effects. It&#x27;s not good enough to set the values of a global variable or register some service purely for the purpose of a test, because the test then does not reflect the runtime behavior of the code. The benefit of a unit test is to assert that code behaves the same way all the time -  not just for specific values you use at the time of testing.<p>> Your example (of testing a database) seems very confused to me. You&#x27;re talking about coupling now. Not global variables. Why would you suddenly need a database connection? Why does the existence of global mutable state mean that nothing in your code can be tested independently? You seem to have a strange idea of how software works.<p>Global variables increase coupling - code which consumes a global variable now has a dependency on all of the code which mutates it. You simply cannot test the consuming code in isolation without regard for the code mutating the variable, unless your test is exhaustive of every possible value which the global variable may contain.<p>My example was not of testing a database, it was about testing algorithms or logic that might exist inside some class named &quot;Person&quot;, but which has a data dependency on an actual person (held in a database). If one wants to test the logic only, then mock data must be supplied instead of the real data from the database - else you&#x27;re not testing only the person, but also testing that the database is connected and querying it is successful. The correct way to test this is to decouple Person from the database, usually be means of a mock object, or by passing the mock data into the person directly. Either way, it seems the blog author does not do such unit tests, as he doesn&#x27;t use mock objects.<p>> I do not use mock objects when building my application, and I do not see the sense in using mock objects when testing. If I am going to deliver a real object to my customer then I want to test that real object and not a reasonable facsimile This is because it would be so easy to put code in the mock object that passes a particular test, but when the same conditions are encountered in the real object in the customer&#x27;s application the results are something else entirely. You should be testing the code that you will be delivering to your customers, not the code which exists only in the test suite.<p>The problem with the author&#x27;s philosophy is that it means when problems do arise in his applications, he must perform whole system testing/debugging to find them. He is missing perhaps the main benefit of unit tests - which is that, when a bug arises, you can quickly eliminate many possible causes because unit tests against those parts of code have succeeded (unless your unit tests were wrong to begin with, which will more or less be the case if they&#x27;re testing against code which depends on globals).",1428849197

Regardless of the manner in which these constants were inserted into the program, changing one of them was going to have direct effects on several calculations and ripple effects on others.  It is just the nature of radar equations.<p>Thus, if you have a program that has an immutable global constant it is likely in the same situation.

Your comment is great, though, and hopefully will find its way to the top of the thread.<p>People often get caught up in &quot;the one true way to do things&quot; mentality.  This is engineering, they think, so there must be a single, indisputable, scientifically provable, ISO standardizable correct way to write software.  Once I know the one true way, I can mechanically apply it and not have to think about it anymore.<p>Someone who subscribes to that mentality might go about creating a lot of ThingDoers with doTheThing() methods.  In the name of never creating dependencies to concrete classes and having 100% test coverage, it is possible to lose perspective of what is important.  If you&#x27;ve made your system less understandable and maintainable than a monolithic procedural class, you&#x27;ve missed the point.<p>Related functionality needs to remain grouped together for understandability.  Abstraction seams need to be created in ways and in places where it makes sense, not mindlessly to every single method in a system.  This is more of an art than a science.<p>One thing that I always keep in the back of my mind is FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition.  It&#x27;s an absurd example of thoughtless one-true-way architecture taken to its extreme, making an extremely simple task incomprehensible but &quot;pure.&quot;  If I&#x27;m ever writing code and FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition pops into my head, I stop and evaluate what I&#x27;m doing.<p>The fact is that in this field there is no autopilot and constant reflection and adaptation is required.  What works in one scenario doesn&#x27;t always work in another.  What works with one codebase doesn&#x27;t necessarily work in another.

Going solo isn&#x27;t as simple or easy as what the OP seems to be implying. Going solo means you are essentially working two jobs at once as it takes a tremendous amount of work and dedication to network, find good projects and keep them rolling in to pay your bills. To further exacerbate things, each year the amount of competition that you face ramps up drastically as more and more workers enter the consulting world who are unable to price themselves correctly and are willing to work for less and less.<p>Furthermore, by going solo, you are now assuming 100% of the risk as to whether or not your new consulting business sinks or swims. Chances are, just like any start up, you will sink. Additionally, you will have added burdens such as insurance requirements, self-employment taxes, various state/county-level taxes (such as gross receipts taxes) and a laundry list of day-to-day operations that you will need to perform that aren&#x27;t related to software development.<p>Going solo really isn&#x27;t for most people and I wish we&#x27;d all stop perpetuating this myth that it is somehow easily attainable. Remember, a solo consulting business is the easiest business you can start, maintaining one is the most difficult business you can run.",1428848717

That sucks, but that&#x27;s life. Don&#x27;t build your entire business around a single partnership, because that signals to your partner that all they have to do to get rid of you is replicate what you do and cut you off. Once you&#x27;ve gone through the blood sweat and tears to prove the market, you&#x27;ve just given your larger partner free market development.<p>DataSift&#x27;s website lists a number of data sources [1], but Twitter comes up first. More importantly, I suspect these sources are slightly massaged to look like they have more sources coming in than are really useful for their business model. e.g. is Wikipedia <i>really</i> in the same space as Twitter? They also have a bunch of minor sources but they&#x27;re listed like they all rank equally. This is fine, most businesses would do the same to make themselves look better -- it&#x27;s just advertising.<p>Another part of business partnerships is that you have to expose your weakness to your partner. Twitter is going to know at some point that DataSift&#x27;s business model is heavily built around their firehose. They might even have some sense about what volume of business all the rest of those sources makes up to DataSift&#x27;s business. Twitter <i>also</i>, through their other partnerships, has a better sense of the size of the Twitter Analytics market. Even if DataSift&#x27;s piece is 15% of the overall market, Twitter has other partners it can use to get a feel for the other 85%.<p>Partnerships are dangerous. Know what you&#x27;re getting into before you get into them, and try to only do them with similar-sized partners or you&#x27;ll find yourself getting screwed over/screwing somebody else over.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.datasift.com/platform/datasources/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datasift.com/platform/datasources/</a>",1428848610

Another is that there&#x27;s a less than obvious relationship between the GROUP BY clause and the SELECT clause.<p>A well-designed block language could offer a lot of guidance on these sort of points, perhaps by having a context-dependent pool of available blocks to drag into the body of the query.<p>At least, doing that would make more sense to me than any graphical query builder I&#x27;ve ever seen, with the bonus that it might lead to users who are more capable of writing SQL directly.

It may have something to do with the tendency for consultants to be vetted from higher up in the management chain where the silver foxes live.</i><p>I can explain this. It&#x27;s a very old idea. The truth about the young hires is that they&#x27;re cheap and the work they do isn&#x27;t very important, but they&#x27;re hired based on the potential to rise a level or few.<p>From an executive perspective, you don&#x27;t hire juniors for the work they&#x27;ll do, because it&#x27;s usually not of high impact of value. You hire based on the probability that they&#x27;ll be high-impact employees later. It&#x27;s impossible to predict this at the individual level, so you&#x27;re building a portfolio.<p>Of course, in 2015, the one-company-for-life model is pretty much dead and most people who get executive positions get them by job hopping at the first sign of an obstacle. Likewise, companies invest very little in their junior employees and tend to hire top-level talent from outside. So the biases from the old days don&#x27;t really make sense.<p>If someone&#x27;s 40 and still a junior or mid-level engineer, the assumption is that he&#x27;s &quot;too old&quot; to become a high-impact employee in 5 years. It&#x27;s completely ridiculous, these days. He could have been doing something else, like trying to make it as a novelist or working in a dive shop. It&#x27;s a hold-over from the employment-for-life, gold-watch era.<p>For the consultant, he&#x27;s not selling himself on some hazy &quot;future potential&quot; factor, so no one cares how old he is or (more relevantly) how old he&#x27;ll be in 10 years.<p>Very few people actually think that young, junior programmers are more skilled or better at their jobs than the 50+ badasses. The issue is that the young juniors come with a 5% chance of being a high-impact, executive-level employee in 10 years. Since the people making big decisions are executives who tend to discount the importance of everyone but executives, this still matters... even though the one-company-for-life model is pretty much dead.",1428848117

9363374,comment,9362252,9363223,0,0,netcan,,,"I talked to a really cool, smart teacher about 2 years ago and I have some murky version of an idea brewing from that chat. She thought about these problems in terms of economics, pedagogy and how it affects the classroom. I am not a teacher but I have been a student so the subject is naturally interesting to me. I also care because I think teaching is a core thing in a society. A lot of other things hang on it.<p>Some key things that are directly determined by the school system seem to be class size & learning pace. At the same time, children&#x27;s attention spans and other complicated realities of learning and how it works in kids or not really in tune with the &quot;industry&quot; of teaching on a society wide scale.<p>Nine year olds in groups of 30 40 or even 20 are a handful when you put them together 6 to 8 hours every day and make them learn reading. Kids only have so much attention span, it varies, but 6 hours is far above the median in practice. A lot of the controversial learning related medication is used primarily to improve a child&#x27;s ability to make it through a school day. Class size. School hours.<p>Learning pace is related to class sizes too. The reality is that the number of hours it takes to teach a 9 year old reading or multiplication  varies, but it the vast majority of cases classrooms go at a pace much slower than could be achieved by a competent teacher 1-on-1. I don&#x27;t know what the multiple is but I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume it&#x27;s high. Call that the reference point for efficiency. That means the potential number of hours needed per child are lower, if the learning quality is higher.<p>Another &quot;economic&quot;issue other than cost and subsequent scarcity of teacher hours is parents&#x27; &quot;babysitting&quot; needs. Parents work. You can&#x27;t work if you need to pick up an eight year old at 11:30 and an eleven year old at 12:45. I have heard interesting ideas here. All sorts of ideas that I don&#x27;t really have the understanding to evaluate, but they sound interesting. If you don&#x27;t need the kids to learn math for half the school hours, teachers don&#x27;t need to be teachers. High schoolers can work at camps, youth clubs. They could also do it in after schools during school hours. They could spend time outside. There are a lot of options. An important note is that these hours are cheaper than classroom hours.<p>Anyway... technology could play an interesting role. If technology and pedagogy can figure out a formula that gives teachers a lever a lot of the economic problems become more solvable and a lot of new models are possible.",1428847518

9363360,comment,9361580,9362068,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>don&#x27;t specialize in programming languages</i><p>Agree and disagree. I think that learning the minutiae of a specific programming language might be an evolutionary dead end. I say &quot;might be&quot; because there are C++ engineers making $500k in HFT. Since we&#x27;re both in the same city (Chicago) now, we both probably know some of them. C++ isn&#x27;t dead yet, and it&#x27;s not even close (but a mediocre C++ engineer is probably hosed).<p>What seems to happen as a technology fades out is that the number of jobs drops, while the pay in those jobs increases. There&#x27;s a risk to it. If you continue to be qualified for those jobs in the depreciating technology, then you&#x27;re solid. If you lose at the game of musical chairs, you can be screwed.<p>There&#x27;s value in learning programming languages if you keep an eye out for the concepts that make them what they are, and if those concepts have a future, which is more likely. We may not need C++ in 25 years, but we are going to have low-level programming problems that require a C-like language (and fluency with assembly languages). Haskell itself may or may not be around in 25 years, but the problems it exists to solve and the value of static typing will still be relevant. Common Lisp is nearly dead, but Clojure is doing well. Languages die, but concepts hibernate at worst.<p>The people who will be screwed are the ones who specialized in minutiae of Java but forgot the computer science itself: the ones who got really good at JVM configuration and Spring and Hibernate but have completely forgotten how computers really work. The really good ones will always have jobs: there&#x27;ll be Java work 50 years from now, just as there is Cobol work now and some of it pays very well, but the more average engineers who only learned The Java Way will be screwed: not good enough to get the dwindling (if well-paid) Java jobs and with too much atrophy of their general CS knowledge to handle whatever is next.",1428847249

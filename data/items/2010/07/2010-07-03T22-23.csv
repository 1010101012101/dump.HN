1484661,comment,1484314,1484314,0,0,dasht,,,"Mr. Grove should consider, in my view, another contemporary issue that puts our society at risk:  the failure of basic infrastructure and the general fragility of engineered environment.<p>We have centralized (and industrialized) food production.  Our power grid, efficient in some ways, creates massive central points of failure.   Centralization of basic retail (e.g., the ""big box"" stores) has gutted small-scale local manufacturing and retail.   Our transportation infrastructure is optimized for cheap oil leaving us with roadways too expensive to maintain well and a neglected rail system.<p>His paradigm for building ""scalable"" industry in the US sounds as if it might be locked back in the vision of industrialism that got us into this infrastructure problem in the first place.<p>I suggest that the scaling we most want is not a few firms that grow very large, but rather many small business industries that better distribute and decentralize essential production.   Examples:   Invent agricultural equipment and supply technology in support of small forms and more labor intenstive forms of agriculture;  focus on manufacturing equipment improvements for small factories;  focus on distributed and decentralized power production and distribution.   Such investments are more difficult to finance because there is less often just a few big winners that generate a handsome ROI -- it's lots of tiny wins.   But it's tiny wins that scale ""horizontally"" across regions and scale up employment just fine while at the same time giving us a more robust, resilient society.",1278197393

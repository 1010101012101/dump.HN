I experience it practically daily. Every time I cross the street at a marked intersection, cars will stop for me 9/10 times. At unmarked intersections, its more like 5/10. Crossing at a stoplight with a walk signal on is still precarious because of the tendency of many drivers to blow through crosswalks without stopping so they can turn right on red. <i>Every single day</i> I experience a situation that could be fatal to a less visible child with a more fragile body and slightly worse situational awareness. No way.<p>The second problem is the CPS story. My neighborhood is extremely safe, but the parents here are borderline psychotic about helicoptering their way through their children&#x27;s lives. Every time I take my kid to a playground, I end up witnessing helicopter parents freaking out about how my kid will climb a ladder by himself or jump off of a piece of equipment by himself... sometimes they swoop in to &quot;parent&quot; for me...and other times they will chew me out for being so irresponsible as to let my kid learn his own boundaries.

Filtering by polygon would be difficult at the moment, although we are actually talking about creating a separate point-in-polygon service (no promises as to when yet :P), since we use it during the process of importing all our data, but the code isn&#x27;t really generalized (it&#x27;s at <a href=""https://github.com/pelias/admin-lookup/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pelias/admin-lookup/</a> if you did want to take a look). However, adding filtering by state is pretty easy. It works the same way as our country lookup: at import time we do point-in-polygon lookup for countries, states, neighborhoods, etc for everything, and then record that as text fields with a consistent name in the actual documents we put in Elasticsearch. Then you can just query the text field and since the names of countries (we use ISO-3166-1 alpha2/3 codes) and states are pretty well defined, it works quite well.<p>2.) Not likely for full polygon data, although we are thinking about doing something with TIGER data which has street address ranges for the US. I&#x27;m not quite sure what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish but you&#x27;re welcome to drop by our gitter room (<a href=""https://gitter.im/pelias/api"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitter.im/pelias/api</a>) and perhaps we can figure something out.<p>3.)

In Japan, every apartment building of size has maintenance people who stay several years and know all the children in the neighborhood, and recognize strangers. Every supermarket has parking attendants. Every construction site has &quot;guards&quot; to make sure people cross the area safely. Every train station has staff around. Many grade schools have patrols of parents who literally &quot;sweep&quot; the neighborhood right before school lets out, just checking that no &quot;out of place&quot; people are hanging around in the parks and neighborhoods.<p>What this REALLY adds up to is like the article said - there are always people out there keeping an eye on things.<p>2) &quot;Japan is safe&quot; - yes, but assaults on children/young people are a problem, and parents worry.

We never want results that aren&#x27;t within the boundary, but this is impossible with other geocoders because they will sort arbitrarily even if you specify a focus. For example, if you only want Montana, typing &quot;San Francisco&quot; should not return the city of SF.<p>(2) Is there a possible workaround that&#x27;s easier to implement? For example, if we can ignore routes (= long roads where no numbered addresses were matched) that&#x27;s an acceptable compromise until you support returning bounds.<p>(3) OSM finds it. The map doesn&#x27;t have a polygon for it, so it&#x27;s likely captured through interpolation. It matches as &quot;house&quot;. I can send you the address privately if you want.

Your feedback is super useful and I think at least some of it we&#x27;ll be able to address relatively soon.<p>1.) We do have a focus point option for autocomplete, with either a soft (will sometimes show you results far away if we think they&#x27;re really relevant) or a hard (only stuff nearby) radius that can be set. Look at the boundary.circle and focus.point parameters in our /v1/search endpoint docs (<a href=""https://github.com/pelias/pelias-doc/blob/master/search.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pelias/pelias-doc/blob/master/search.md</a>). As you probably realized tuning this for general use is actually quite difficult, but if you&#x27;re running pelias yourself there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from tuning to your particular use case. But if you&#x27;re running your own instance you can also just add a filter by state, since we already have a state field in all our documents.<p>2.) That&#x27;s right, even for our datasets that have polygon data (only OSM and Quattroshapes), we just take the center point. This is something we want to add in the future, but it may take a few months at least, since we don&#x27;t currently have much infrastructure for handling polygon data. We also have another awesome team at Mapzen that is working on a gazetteer project called Who&#x27;s On First(<a href=""http://whosonfirst.mapzen.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whosonfirst.mapzen.com</a>) that should really help by offering concordance between datasets.<p>3.)

Most of the above groups are risk averse, so this is a non-trivial project. People who succeed at it spend a large chunk of their career on the process.<p>The “easy” way to build up the understanding and support to play this game is to get elected to some lower office, and spend years working within the system, raising money, working with other elected officials, getting to know all the key players.

10320926,comment,10319698,10320660,0,0,joseraul,,,"Its take on probability as a way of modelling our brain is refreshing, for instance, the beginning of chapter 1:<p>Suppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewelry store with a broken window. Then a gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which turns out to be full of expensive jewelry. The policeman doesn&#x27;t hesitate at all in deciding that this gentleman is dishonest. But by what reasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion? Let us first take a leisurely look at the general nature of such problems.<p>A moment&#x27;s thought makes it clear that our policeman&#x27;s conclusion was not a logical deduction from the evidence; for there may have been a perfectly innocent explanation for everything. It might be, for example, that this gentleman was the owner of the jewelry store and he was coming home from a masquerade party, and didn&#x27;t have the key with him. But just as he walked by his store a passing truck threw a stone through the window; and he was only protecting his own property. Now while the policeman&#x27;s reasoning process was not logical deduction, we will grant that it had a certain degree of validity. The evidence did not make the gentleman&#x27;s dishonesty certain, but it did make it extremely plausible. This is an example of a kind of reasoning in which we haveall become more or less proficient, necessarily, long before studying mathematical theories. We are hardly able to get through one waking hour without facing some situation (e.g. will it rain or won&#x27;t it?) where we do not have enough information to permit deductive reasoning; but still we must decide immediately what to do.",1443816088

We&#x27;ve been looking for something to run ourselves that can replace Google.<p>However, I found a few flaws after a couple of minutes of testing.<p>1. Neither search nor autocomplete appears to support filtering by fields other than country? We have an app that needs to filter autocompletions by state. A focus point might be sufficient if the autocompleter aggressively sorts results based on distance, but I have yet to meet one that does this (or allows a tuning of the distance function). A rectangular bounding box filter doesn&#x27;t cut it. I guess I&#x27;ll have to check out the code and see if this can be added/improved.<p>2. The API only returns points, with no boundary information, for street addresses. We have an app that uses geocoding to match street addresses to points. But if your address is a bit imprecise and matches an <i>entire stretch of highway</i> (it happens a lot!), that&#x27;s obviously not a valid match — something like &quot;Highway 66&quot; is just wrong. Google will wisely return a bounds object that you can compute the area for and determine if it&#x27;s small enough that it&#x27;s likely a precise enough location (we use 10m2 as the maximum). Unlike Google, Mapzen doesn&#x27;t even tell you that your match is a &quot;route&quot; — everything is an individual street address. Not sure how trivial this would be to implement, as boundaries would need support from datasets; OSM has the required data, OpenAddresses might not.<p>3. Street address matching seems a bit patchy. I tried my Brooklyn street address, and it didn&#x27;t find it. The building was constructed last year, though, so maybe it&#x27;s old data. Can someone from Mapzen comment?",1443816031

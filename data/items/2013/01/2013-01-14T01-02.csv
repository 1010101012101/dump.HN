5052823,comment,5051892,5051892,1,0,julienmarie,,,"There is just something really wrong here, and even if it may appear clich, it is really not clich. There is a great confusion between sex and desire. Making love with someone is not about having sex, it is about desiring someone. This works only if you share a real intimacy, i.e. if you let this intimacy exist between you two.  The arousal doesn't come from sexual prowesses, but just because you desire that specific person you share your intimacy with.
After, sex for sex, is always about fantasies, power... in a word, ""fun"" ( even when it's not fun ;) )
And then there is hygiene, just bodily functions. Like masturbation.
Sexuality is wide, wild, and complex, it's the mirror of our inner world. Porn is just a business around it.",1358127419

The cultural bias comes into play more strongly around the question of how much dissonance is ""good"" vs. ""bad"", and how the more dissonant bits should interplay with the more consonant bits of music.<p>Certainly, ""more consonant = better"" isn't true in any culture I can think of.... Imagine an orchestra that tunes up, then they all play the note A in various octaves for 3 hours.<p>Possibly also worth mentioning that this isn't quite correct:<p>> The traditional classical Western twelve-note scale consists of the 12 simplest frequency ratios<p>You're thinking of the major scale, maybe?

5052814,comment,5051892,5051892,87,0,mattm,,,"I know this is outing myself but this is my personal experience.  I won't post anonymously in case anyone wants to contact me.  I came to the realization about 2 years that I am addicted to porn.  For anyone out there struggling with the same thing, it can get better and yes, it is probably having a negative influence on your life.  Previously I would look about once per week but in the past 6 months, I have probably viewed only 3 or 4 times and am hopeful going forward that I will never view it again.<p>The difference between internet porn and porn from the past is just the abundance of new material that there is.  Each time you view something new, your brain gives a hit of dopamine.  In fact, porn addicts are not really addicted to porn, they're addicted to the chemical sensations that their brain provides.  At the basic level, it really is not much different from any other addiction.  Old, offline porn is different in that it gets stale pretty quickly.  There are only so many times you can look at a magazine or video without it getting boring.<p>The problem with this is that your dopamine levels get out of whack.  You need a higher and higher amount to feel satisfied.  This is how people get roped in.  This also caused normal, life things that were once enjoyable to become less so, such as hanging out with friends or programming.  Life just becomes more dull.  In fact, now that I have learned about this, whenever I see a post on HN about how someone has lost their interest in programming or other activities, the first thing I think of is probably this person has a porn addiction.  It's not a far stretch seeing as how most of HN is young men.  Having drastically reduced the amount I see, I have noticed many benefits in my life including better health and ability to focus better.<p>Porn, like other addictions, are also a way of masking stress and a way of distracting yourself from negative emotions.  Dr. Gabor Mate has done great research linking addictions of any kind to stresses in the body.  Porn gives a way to temporarily release the stress but puts the person in a vicious cycle of causing more long-term stress.<p>Personally, I use the recovery information from <a href=""http://www.feedtherightwolf.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feedtherightwolf.org</a>.  It has been the only thing I have across which can really break the cycle.<p>As someone else pointed out the videos from <a href=""http://yourbrainonporn.com/your-brain-on-porn-series"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yourbrainonporn.com/your-brain-on-porn-series</a> will really help you understand what is going on in your brain.",1358127332

People need to feel guilty so they self-police themselves, and it also has to be something that is common (such as sex) so everyone is always guilty.  Guilty people are vulnerable and easily controlled.<p>This has to be planted early in the childhood, then it sort of becomes automatic and not that easy to unlearn.

It has got quite popular among scientist, and it's peer reviewed. However, it charges the authors with a small fee, usually around $1000 per article. For some scientists this is a problem. Personally I think this is a much better and a more economic systemic model than subscriptions. The subscription model unfortunately is pretty nasty (<a href=""http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=890"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=890</a>), to the point that thousands of scientists, and among them some renown geniuses, have decided to boycott it (<a href=""http://thecostofknowledge.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thecostofknowledge.com</a>).

Is it really that hard to think of one or two personality traits that keep you from steamrolling through your day?<p>My answers may very well be different in 5 or 10 years, but for now:<p>1) If someone asks me for a time estimate, I always try to immediately come up with a rough number, which never takes into account ""the last 20% takes 80% of the work."" I'm trying to get better at not committing before having a spec, but I still have that habit.<p>2) I tend to get lightly emotionally invested in the code I'm currently writing. If I've spent two or three days working on something and find out that the requirements have changed, or that I need to architect my solution a different way, I usually need to work on something different for a day before I go back to it - otherwise, I stress out about having just wasted that effort.<p>Any interviewer that finds these answers unacceptable either shouldn't be asking the question, or is representing a company that I absolutely would not want to work for.",1358125275

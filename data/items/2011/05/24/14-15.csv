The difference between a good photographer and a bad one is largely how well they curate their work. Don't go to the MOMA and get depressed because the walls are lined with incredible works by incredible photographers - realize that it's an <i>incredibly</i> selected subset of everything they've done. After all, you're taking decades of a career and choosing only the finest, oh, 50 photographs?<p>- your keep rate shouldn't be much above 1%. 99% of the pictures you take will be shit, and that's just the natural order of things. Throw these out - preview them at home from the SD/CF card, and make sure none of them ever survive to your HDD. Treat the remaining 1% carefully (back them up). Spend time editing them and looking at them with a critical eye to see if they can be better.<p>- slow down, think more. New photographers mash the shutter release as if it dispenses candy, particularly in the digital age. Put a jar on the kitchen table at home - put a quarter into it for <i>every single picture you take</i> (or $0.50, or $1, depending on what is good for you). Donate this jar to charity or something - the point here is to force you to take fewer pictures. You will work harder for each one, and think more before each shot, and these will make your work <i>dramatically</i> better. Personally, I do this by shooting film. I rarely leave home with more than 50 exposures or so in the camera/bag. On a good day I'll shoot maybe 15 pictures.<p>- go shooting more. What work inspires you? Ansel Adams? Winogrand? Cartier-Bresson? Look at <i>lots</i> of photographs and think about what makes them great and what you like about them. Then go out and try to ""see"" the same images in real life. A photographer's eye is far more important than their ability to operate a DSLR.<p>- join a critique group. Yes, this will suck for your ego, but it is <i>extremely</i> helpful for your development. Join a <i>small</i> group (5-10 people max) so it's not a complete zoo. These people will tell you <i>how</i> to make your pictures better and give you actual directionality in your improvement.<p><i>Lots</i> of people in photography are hackers. If you're ever in Seattle, give me a shout and we'll go shooting. Otherwise, keep snapping.",1306248802

Most departments have a regular colloquium, where the entire <i>point</i> is to listen to a talk to mathematicians outside your specialty. Many speakers do a good job, but there are some who will start out with ""Let M be a symplectic manifold, let omega be the associated bilinear form, let X be the ring of differentials, ..."" [ugh.]<p>And yet I think there is more pressure to write and speak well than there is to do so poorly. Certainly as a graduate student I was pressured by my advisor to explain things clearly, to add examples and exposition to my papers, to omit technical details from talks, and in general to keep in mind the perspective of the non-expert. The author complains, ""Submit a paper with two consecutive sentences of exposition and watch how quickly the referee gets on you for it."" But I have not experienced this myself, nor heard this complaint from anyone until this article.<p>Moreover I can think of lots of well-known books that are loaded with exposition. <i>Representation Theory</i> by Fulton and Harris comes particularly to mind. Of course, there are many books which are notoriously terse as well. (Any HN'ers tried to hack their way through Baby Rudin?)<p>Indeed, there are many mathematicians who make quite an effort to write and speak well, and largely succeed, and the author seems unable to identify any mathematical writing which he does approve of. If we are doing a bad job, please give us <i>specific examples</i> of what you would like to see instead.<p>The fact is that learning new math is just <i>damn hard</i>, even from well-written papers. I think that we could do a much better job of explaining our work to others. But, IMHO, this article overstates the problem, and omits to propose any practical solutions.",1306248056

1651175,comment,1650814,1651103,0,0,blhack,,,"This is an incredibly difficult thing to do.  You're essentially going to have to rely on your users to categorize things, which they probably won't do.<p>One person's academic article is another person's lolcat picture.<p>This was exemplified to me recently on <a href=""http://newslily.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newslily.com/</a>;   We had a new user who was constantly submitting things that he thought were appropriate for ""science"" or ""medicine"", but they weren't (at least not in the opinion of most of the users).  To him, this was hard science; good stuff, but it was mostly things that we weren't interested in.  How would the slider work for him?<p>The solution (one that is similar to what digg did [although we've had this for about a year, humph]) was effectively user-whitelisting.  Now, what you see on the front page of the site is things that our moderators have approved, and what you see in the various categories (or ""upcoming"" section) is things from users that you have whitelisted.<p>A major misunderstanding (and why I think that user-whitelisting is better than what reddit or HN do [and is also why I think a control like what you're talking about wouldn't workd]) is that people are <i>not</i> all the same; this is why I like the idea behind what digg did (hey, it's worked for facebook and twitter, right?)",1283295564

What motivates any individual cabbie to acknowledge that they should be the one to give that fare up rather than someone else?  And what job do they take in its place?

1651113,comment,1649684,1650409,0,0,cmdrkeene,,,"To your issues:<p>1) Yeah, organization is crazy. I think the method comparison is a bit unfair though. In theory, each step should be easily identifiable (like a method) but this is rarely the case given that most steps have complex regex matching (sometimes for grammatical niceness - e.g. (a vs. an), sometimes for other crazy town reasons). This makes not only automated indexing difficult (RubyMine tries...) but trying to keep hundreds of steps in your head is pretty hard. Especially one's you probably didn't write.<p>The cool thing about steak is that helpers and ""reusable steps"" are actually just methods! Hello ctags :D<p>b) Our case was:<p><pre><code>  And the user ""212-555-1234"" should receive a text with:
    | Some ""double quoted"" and 'single quoted' text |
</code></pre>
Definitely possible in cucumber, but I prefer a string equality assertion:<p><pre><code>  text.should == ""..."" (you have to do this anyway in the step_definition)
</code></pre>
c) Ben Maeby's email_spec is awesome and provides some steps for clicking on links in email. I still use the library in steak (just the raw rspec matchers though).<p>The trouble is you have a url:<p><pre><code>  http://coolsite.org/something/abcde22424aw3324234
</code></pre>
The matcher provided says:<p>I click on the link ""Link Title or URL"". Since the token is random every time (unless you stub it, which is kinda out of the spirit of acceptance testing, but that's another debate) it's hard to say ""Click on the link with the big ass token in it"".<p>You can definitely write a step like:<p><pre><code>  And I visit the account confirmation link
</code></pre>
Again, a matter of preference for abstracting the step with one-time use, highly coupled text to code vs. a comment and the code together. The actual mechanics are the same in both systems, it's just that cucumber hides them in a one-time use step away from the actual feature whereas the steak is inline.<p>d) Similar to the above, the catch all step can work in cucumber. Though, in a few scenarios, it's desirable to run only specific jobs or more often in our case, to check if jobs are scheduled in a specific way. It avoids the weird scenario of writing a step definition like ""And I run only the blah jobs"" or ""And a blah job should be scheduled with ..."". Ideally the job system would be decoupled entirely from the acceptance test, but we can't all do cool stuff like this all the time: <a href=""http://corner.squareup.com/2010/08/cucumber-and-resque.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://corner.squareup.com/2010/08/cucumber-and-resque.html</a>",1283294417

My original point in this line of argument was that one of the main reasons cabs <i>don't</i> contribute to congestion in the city is because the number of cabs allowed in is capped.  <i>You're</i> the one who wants to make that number bigger.<p><i>Also, I didn't realize that the 37'th percentile of income (36'th percentile in NY [1]) did not count as lower middle class</i><p>The labels are flexible depending on who's drawing the boundaries, I'm sure.  The point is that I wasn't contradicting myself when I said your plan would both cut a certain class of jobs and increase traffic, I was simply saying that you're replacing fewer higher-paying jobs with more lower-paying ones.  Where we disagree is that I think in this case that's equivalent to giving rich people a break and forcing more of the city's service workers to live further away, and I assume you don't.<p><i>If the congestion tax costs less than $24,000/year/cab, consumers still pay less for a taxi.</i><p>You're taking the savings from the medallion and labor costs that you posited above and assuming they'd be passed directly to the consumer, but that's overly simplistic.  More competition means marketing costs go up, which drives the fares back up a bit.  The congestion tax is presumably convincing fewer people to drive to work, which increases the demand for cabs, which drives the fares back up a bit more.<p>The point was not ""you are wrong about consumer prices going down"", it was ""you have to start modeling the problem more carefully to have a meaningful conversation about it"".  You're probably right, consumers would save money, but again, given who the consumers are (oversimplifying: rich people), I don't necessarily see that as a good thing when it comes at the cost of cabbie pay.",1283292423

That's it.<p>Why it works: When two things are equal, if we transform them in identical ways (being careful about what ""identical"" means), then the results are equal. So if two differentiable functions are equal, then their derivatives must be equal.<p>What it's good for: In spite of all the carefully selected examples we're given in calculus class, the fact is that solving equations is often very difficult, and usually <i>impossible</i>. So if someone writes some ""f(x,y) = k"", and asks you to solve for y in terms of x, well, in general, you can't do it.<p>Now, suppose you want to find dy/dx in the above situation. The ""usual"" way is to solve for y and then differentiate. But what if you cannot do that? If you can find the derivative, w.r.t. x, of f(x,y), then you can apply implicit differentiation, to get something like g(x,y)*dy/dx + h(x,y) = 0. Then finding dy/dx is easy.<p>So: What it is good for is finding a derivative while avoiding the pain (or the impossibility) of solving an equation.<p>Of course, that leads to the question of what derivatives are good for, but I'm hoping you have some inkling of the answer to that one. If not, then back up, and learn more about derivatives.",1283292079

1651011,comment,1650898,1650898,0,0,SandB0x,,,"In your example, y <i>is</i> a function of x. x is also a function of y. If you pick a value for x, there is a unique y that satisfies the equality. If you pick a value for y, there a unique x that satisfies the equality. Let's find y as a function of x<p><pre><code>    x^2y = 5 => y = 5x^-2 <------ this is y(x)
</code></pre>
That's all it means. This a <i>function</i>, because as mentioned, x uniquely determines y.<p>Now let's look at an example where y is <i>not</i> a function of x - the standard example of a circle of radius r:<p><pre><code>    x^2 + y^2 = r^2
</code></pre>
solving for y gives<p><pre><code>    y = +- sqrt(r^2 - x^2).
</code></pre>
This is NOT a function, because for a value of x, we don't know which value of y to choose - it could be the positive case or the negative case. Geometrically, this means a line (like y = c) can intersect the circle in two places, so trying to find <i>the</i> single intersection point is not well defined.<p>But the <i>gradient</i> y' IS a function, a function of both x and y and we can find it by implicit differentiation (with respect to x):<p><pre><code>    2x + 2yy' = 0 => y' = -x/y  <---- this is y'(x,y)

Geometrically this means that <i>given</i> a point (x,y) on a circle, the gradient <i>is</i> a well defined quantity, even though y(x) is not.<p>------------<p>Also: I had a look at your submission history and I really don't think that HN is the right place for most of your questions.

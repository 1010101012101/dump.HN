I'm not 100% sure I understand how he's implemented this, however. I'd be useful to see some more specific examples than the extremely abstract high-level diagram.<p><i>My approach was to introduce it in a stealth manner. I first discussed the idea with a couple of programmers individually, and eventually convinced them it was a good idea. I then implemented the basic framework for generic components, and implemented one small aspect of game object functionality as a component.<p>I then presented this to the rest of the programmers. There was some confusion and resistance, but since it was implemented and working there was not much argument.</i><p>This bit sounds familiar...",1258898087

955726,comment,955427,955548,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Typically, payment agreements such as this are blanket agreements. Spofiy agrees to give X% of its revenues to the musicians (indirectly) and in exchange it can use their music. This is not a fixed fee as it varies with Spotify's revenues. If Spotify can't get any revenue for a year, the musicians won't get paid at all for that year. RIAA is a recording industry association (dealing with mechanical rights) while the article is about paying composers (which is performing rights) so it's not like ""RIAA members"" valued these tracks to anything. Also RIAA is American where Spotify is not present at the moment.",1258897859

It was largely the result of having the needs to easily doing unit test without doing extremely complicated of a setup and as well making it far easier to maintain my code.<p>This setup migrates the game codebase from total disaster to something that is much cleaner. Now that this article has come into views, I fear that the codebase I have will slip back into oblivion as models, their corresponding rendering code, and the controllers gathers into blobs.",1258897719

However, a negative result wouldn't necessarily disprove the theory because violins may appear simple, but they are acoustically very complex.

The strings alone can make a significant difference to the sound of a violin.

If the wood got more tight when the instrument is left alone its brightness would increase, not decrease.\nBut what's the point of theorizing when musicians would rather rationalize their beliefs than doing a simple experiment?",1258897340

955719,comment,955427,955427,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Let me clear up a few misconceptions here. Is that one million plays worldwide or one million plays in Sweden? The population of Sweden is about 10 million people, I really doubt that a single track accumulated as much as one million plays so quickly.<p>And if the number is worldwide, why do they expect STIM (Swedish Performing Rights society) to pay for it? Of course they won't, STIM only collects royalties for performances in Sweden! Every country in the world has its own performing rights collection society. For music played in the United Kingdom, she gets paid by PRS, in France it's SACEM etc.<p>Artists usually don't have the ""performing rights"" for a music. The person who gets the performing rights royalty payments after a music is the composer. Lady GaGa received that paycheck not as an artist/performer but as the composer of that track (along with Nadir Khayat). She is not the only composer of the track so she only gets her share of the payments. The article has huge factual mistakes.",1258897278

I'm not particularly fond of Martins when they're new, but give them a few years to mature, and it's amazing. I've always assumed this had something to do with the wood fibers loosening up over time along with everything settling.<p>There's a lot of this stuff in music, though.

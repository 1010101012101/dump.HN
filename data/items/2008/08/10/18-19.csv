The key point of the article is that it was a cultural rather than a resource based shift that helped Denmark become energy independent.<p>I read a recent estimation that America has enough oil for 3 years at it's current rate of consumption. Unless consumption is dramatically reduced drilling is just going to tap out a resource that would be best saved for a real emergency.<p>Europe has been coping with smaller more efficient cars, and driving habits for decades. American can too.",1218394774

The message I got from Seth here is to take the broad, macroscopic view; if your first startup fails, don't quit, try again.  And again.  And again, if need be.  Be patient.<p>This essay was good, but I thought Ira Glass presented a related idea in a much more powerful way here:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hidvElQ0xE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hidvElQ0xE</a>.

It happened before, but as a plan it's like moving to Hollywood with a strategic goal to become a film star within a year.",1218394578
272492,comment,272403,272472,0,0,olavk,,,"Denmark is a net exporter of oil and natural gas. We import coal because its a cheaper source of energy than oil, so it makes sense to use coal rather than oil in power plants. But I believe that Denmark is a net exporter of energy at this time. Our oil is running out, though, this is why we invest in other forms of energy like wind.",1218394241

They use YouTube as a search engine (eh?) when something more specialized like DZone or SourceForge or even delicious would be better. They use only one query and counting mentions of it, hardly a measure of real-world popularity.<p>Some better metrics: number of new projects written in a language. Number of servers hosting sites written in a language.<p>Anything really. Google hit counts doesn't cut it.",1218394079

To say no energy from the Middle East is misleading. They buy their oil on the open market like everybody else.

272482,comment,272403,272465,0,0,maximilian,,,"What are you trying to say with the 0% stat.  If I were going to use more wind energy, I wouldn't just shut down a coal plant and throw up a million wind turbines.  I would just add more wind turbines as our energy needs grew.  So ideally you add a lot of wind turbines to mitigate building a new coal burning plant.<p>You will probably always need things like coal plants because they are very efficient and always work.  You probably build a hybrid of wind turbines and gas powered turbines that are very adjustable.  On a good wind day you you use less of the gas turbines and on a bad wind day you use more of the gas turbines to meet demand.  The coal (or nuclear) plants are the base upon which you build your solar or wind system.",1218392677

272472,comment,272403,272449,0,0,gruseom,,,"Actually, the coal was one thing I was wondering about. The statement was 99% of <i>energy</i>, not 99% of oil. That can't possibly be true with coal in the picture. Note that in this case the exaggeration comes not from a journalist but from the Minister of Energy.<p>It sounds as if the kernel of truth here is maybe that Denmark produces more oil than it consumes. But I would be shocked to hear that Danish oil is produced by Danish rigs and transported via Danish pipelines to Danish refineries. Rather, oil from Danish territory goes into the same global market as all the other oil, and the Danes buy oil the same way (and at the same price) that everybody else does. So the Middle East bit is a red herring.",1218391904

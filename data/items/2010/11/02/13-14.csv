1860384,comment,1859396,1859396,0,0,weego,,,"Knowing your use-case actors is a primary requirement before anything else is done. You should have atleast 2 or 3 just having come up with the idea to build software (by that I mean you will have an implicit actor just by deciding someone needs a bit of software), but UI wise you need much more granular detail.\nThe implicit actor for your software is usually as simple as ""a freelance developer needs to be able keep track of the time they devote to projects so they can effectively bill their clients while minimising time wasted on their own admin"".<p>When you want to create use-case actors for the UI side you want to really think about people and not functions. The Joomla admin system is, in my opinion, an example of something that was written as a set of functional requirements without anyone attempting any user empathy.<p>A starting point here might be:\n""Tom is going into his second year as a freelance developer, having had a more successful first year than he had anticipated. Tom doesn't keep detailed time records and ends up partially guessing at the end based on emails but as he works with clients he likes he's been happily underestimating because his income is really good compared to his old job, and what is an hour or 2 anyway?<p>He has just taken on some work with a really well known agency who want work break-downs to 15 minute accuracy included with invoices, and while he doesn't really see what the point is, this is a big opportunity for him and wants it to go smoothly. He is also a little intimidated by his contacts at the agency and doesn't want to cause any conflict.<p>Tom is willing to run the time software for working with this agency, but at the moment doesn't really imagine the benefits to using it for his existing clients because it seems like more effort every day than it is just to do what he usually does at the end of the month.""<p>From here you can extract lots of valuable information that will inform your UI cases. You know instantly for example that if you need to read a PDF to understand how to even start tracking project time this user will no doubt ditch the product because right now he is not really buying into the concept.<p>Case 1:\nThe user must be able to record time information on a per-project basis to specified precisions, broken down by task.<p>Now look at Case 1 and ask yourself how you would go about building the task tracking UI for your actor. Would you build something like a tray app that he can quickly select the project, add a row into with a name, and then run a start/stop timer on that task? Would you add a way to show visual reminders that a task is still running every x minutes? Why?\nOr would you make it a system that you had to log into where you click into a project, then create a new task, then on the next page you can put in the time you spend on that task, save that and go back to the project panel, then swap projects and put in some new time against another task?<p>Both effectively do the same thing, but which one is Tom more likely to use for his current requirement, and more importantly for your business, which one might affect his opinion that it's more hassle than it's worth and would look to expand his use of your product to all his business (and this possibly be up-sold to)?<p>Writing clear and precise actors that have some empathy to them makes a huge difference to IA and UX as a complement to a good set of functional requirements.<p>(Note: I've cheated a little by basing my example to expand on as developers, as this makes it very easy to remove actors who don't understand technology that well).<p>And that is really a starting point, I've not touched on using real users to inform your decisions (though things like card sorting) and I would really suggest that if you use people to test wireframes or early designs you don't sit over their shoulder but screen-share with them instead, as people definitely tend to act differently when they are in a ""test"" environment with someone watching them.",1288705920

Android, Adobe AIR, Google Chrome, Safari, and iPhone all use WebKit for rendering. One problem with GWT is that it does not allow you to write applications that run as desktop applications (even though GWT's development toolset for rendering is based on WebKit).""<p>And:<p>""When you're ready to deploy your application to the Web, you need to be a bit more careful about what library you include. It is common to use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-RPC services from a Pyjamas application running in the browser.""<p>I'd give a blog post a pass, but this is a web property that I assume has an editor and pays authors for their submissions.<p>Also, pyjamas confuses me because two of GWT's rationales for existence are:<p>1. Using static analysis of your code to heavily optimize the resulting Javascript.<p>2. Using static language tools (Eclipse, etc.) to maintain order in large codebases<p>For 1), at Java->Javascript compile time, GWT will inline code, prune dead code, make calls un-polymorphic, and other fancy optimizations driven by the static typing. The goal is to make your Javascript as fast, or likely faster, than it'd be if written by hand.<p>Similar optimizations can be done these days at runtime by good VMs, e.g. the JVM and V8 (probably?), but the point with GWT is that crappy browsers (IE6-8) don't optimize at runtime, so GWT helps them out and does it at compile time.<p>For 2), whether or not you buy the assertion that IDEs/static typing make larger codebases easier to maintain, that is nonetheless the GWT team's assertion and something people using GWT generally agree with.<p>So, if you forgo static typing, and so give up static analysis, and a static tool chain/IDE, why are you not just using Javascript itself?<p>(Edit: formatting.)",1288705818

The best opportunity an individual has to influence elections is to vote in the primaries but few people bother to show up. You'll have the choice of a dozen candidates or more -- most of whom have a very legitimate shot at getting the nomination. It's common for primaries to be decided by only a couple hundred votes because so few people show up to vote. For the general election you have less choices but, at the local level, it's still winner takes all democracy. There are always third parties and/or write-ins if you don't want to vote for the two major parties. In many places we have referendums or propositions on the ballot which offer the most direct form of democracy<p>The argument people make about their votes 'not counting' is like an individual choosing not to join the basketball team because they might not hit the winning shot. Every point counts. I don't understand the extreme egotism that people would opt not to participate unless they get to cast the deciding vote. Talk about un-democratic?

I'll hit on a few highlights.<p>""Ray Tracing, which has major issues with memory and cache""<p>Memory is impossible to make generalizations about with rendering but there are situations where ray tracing can use <i>far less</i> memory than scanline.<p>Consider if you have a NURBS surface you'd like to render.  With a raytracer, you can solve the ray to surface directly.  With a scanline renderer, you must tesselate that surface.   Or consider a simple sphere.  The memory used to define a sphere can be 4 floats -- xyz position and radius.  Solving a ray-sphere intersection is as simple as it gets.  With a scanline renderer...it's a lot  more.  And say you have a velocity and want to motion blur it.  Raytracer: 7 floats, stochastic sample the rays in time.  Scanline render... it's even more RAM.<p>Renderman is not a pure scanline renderer anymore.  It has had raytracing for a long time.<p>""Almost all animated movies are rendered using RenderMan""<p>No, all of Pixars are.  That's not ""almost all"".  Dreamworks uses a proprietary renderer.  Blue Sky uses a pure raytracer for their movies (Ice Age 1,2,3, Robots, Horton Hears a Who).  I'm sure others use Mental Ray.<p>""Without going into the technical details...""<p>If you're interested in the graphics space, you should really learn a lot more about how and when raytracing is useful and efficient.  I've used pure raytracers and pure scanline renderers in production, I by far preferred the pure raytracer.  A compromise between the two is best in general.",1336334357

3936114,comment,3935828,3936063,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Ray tracing is actually the exact opposite of the way light in the real world works. In the real world light starts at light sources, bounces off objects, and ends in your eye. Ray tracing starts at the ""eye"". The one thing that ray tracing does well is model reflections, but as it turns out that's not that hard of a problem and easily approximated with many other techniques. More so, it's not even remotely the dominant problem in photorealistic rendering, as reflections are often not the dominant part of any particular scene. In some ways the radiosity technique has a better claim to mimicing ""the real world"" but that's sort of beside the point, any rendering model is going to be an empirical approximation and not an attempt at photon simulation.",1336334157

This has caused issues because coins are expensive to ship there, and yet in Zimbabwe the value of small denomination coins are still quite relevant.

It's true that there are probably more implementations than we really need, but they do serve different niches.

Of course, most of them have their own extensions, but a lot of these (particularly in the important areas of multithreading and foreign function calling) are now abstracted by portable libraries.

3936018,comment,3928155,3932108,1,0,drostie,,,"(3) To solve your first problem, remember that a definition is independent of its rhetorical purpose: that is, it tells you what we're talking about, but it does not force or ""backdoor"" any sort of metaphysics upon you. To solve your second problem, realize that you're committing a fallacy of equivocation: you're assuming that because something is <i>ontologically</i> subjective -- that is, it only makes sense in the context of a subject which experiences it -- that it is <i>epistemically</i> subjective -- that is, it can only be known, talked about, and reasoned about, by that subject who experiences it.<p>(4) Just look at the words you chose: ""I perceive a very disjointed self."" You chose the singular 'I' and the singular 'a self'. As a subject, you would like to be <i>just one</i> subject -- you would like all of the parallel efforts of your different neurons to identify one ""me"". But then suddenly you're astonished that all of your experiences must be described as <i>unifying</i> into a single whole, which can't simply be treated as separate senses, but come to you as part of one whole conscious experience. That in turn astonishes me.<p>If you believe Sperry's ideas on his split-brain patients, then yes, there is evidence that to divide the brain creates <i>two</i> conscious processes, simply by cutting off communication between parts of the brain. I guess you could add that to the list above, although it's not unique to quantum processes -- but if consciousness were caused by something quantum, then you would indeed expect that two systems which could no longer entangle could no longer form the same consciousness. But this is also true for certain classical systems, like computer networks, and might just as easily be described as a network effect -- which is why I didn't include it.<p>Re your discussion that cars are a bad example: I agree; I used them because (1) they were your example and (2) I never proposed that we ""need to bring in quantum mechanics to explain why we don't understand the brain."" Again, the question I was answering was, ""why are some researchers so quick to blame our failure to understand consciousness on quantum mechanics when we don't yet understand the classical parts of the brain?"" -- which presumes an agreement that yes, the brain is indeed something whose classical parts we don't yet understand. The question was ""why might some people reasonably think that quantum mechanics will form an essential part of the theory?""<p>(5) It doesn't matter what people agree or disagree. What is pivotal about the Star Trek transporter case, what I am trying to articulate, is that it creates all sorts of difficult problems about <i>identity</i>. In particular, quantum consciousness theories, while often functionalist and materialist, see an opposition from much of what passes presently for materialist functionalism. This <i>particular</i> brand of materialist functionalism has certain philosophical problems, because they conceptualize consciousness as some sort of <i>logical pattern</i> or <i>arrangement</i>. So, for example, if a computer simulated a brain, even though we would say that there is no ""brain"" per se, presumably these people would say that there is nonetheless consciousness.<p>Now, the problems are diverse, and since I mentioned above the ontological/epistemic subjectivity distinction of Searle, I would like to raise that in the same articles Searle also mentions an observer-relative vs. observer-independent distinction: whether something is a computation depends on how you look at it, he points out -- but whether you are conscious should not depend on how I look at you.<p>That's not the Star Trek problem. The Star Trek problem comes instead, for me, from a book called <i>Reasons and Persons</i> by Derek Parfit -- it's relegated to part three of the book, but otherwise it's a good read, and you can skip to the chapter if you want without missing anything. There are an abundance of things which you might think ""make you <i>you</i>,"" or more generally, make you the same person as you were five minutes ago, or even five years ago. But thinking about the Star Trek transporter, and one's visceral reactions to certain stories about imperfect transporters, tends to make many of these philosophically problematic. The problem is that even though there are two people who are <i>qualitatively identical</i> in the world, they are not ""the same person"" in the above sense. So the fact that you are ""the same person"" as someone five minutes ago would appear to not depend on any particular quality or aggregate of qualities. Qualities wouldn't make you who you are.<p>You've added, as I see it, that since the universe is quantum, even <i>physical</i> continuity can be made epistemically ill-defined if the replicas are sufficiently exact, but I don't think materialists would have a real problem with that.<p>But here's where a quantum approach could have a benefit: in a quantum theory of consciousness, qualities perhaps <i>could</i> make you who you are. The whole thought experiment crumbles if the device is not even in principle realizable, and that's precisely what quantum mechanics purports to offer.<p>(5b) The ""it"" is quantum mechanics.<p>(5c) First off that's not what I claimed -- I claimed that ""some of the building-blocks of warm-and-fuzzy consciousness just fall out."" Second, you're in luck: if Newtonian mechanics is sufficient to you, then Ehrenfest's theorem makes consciousness fall out of quantum mechanics, problem solved. Unfortunately, your ""theory"" requires modification because the ""thermal noise"" is quantum and the ""deterministic parts"" are not deterministic at bottom, but other than that, I invite you to use whatever your theory is, and apply your Hamiltonian with the Schrodinger equation rather than with Hamilton's equations of motion. On average, you'll get consciousness out again. QM does not take away; it adds.",1336332144

The text is convincing and well organized ('Pitfalls of others' is the strongest moment). But the design contradicts the content - I read 'trust' but can not trust the page. There are 3 factors which cause that (in my case): font, color-palette and the photo on the cover. Yes, I think that the cover photo is working against you. It shows a scene which induces negative emotions - someone who has something to hide. You see it often in the media (compromised politicians, suspects/accused people, guilty celebs etc.) and it's associated with negative reactions. As a result when I open the page I automatically feel aversion. I'd change the pic to something more safe (even the cliche padlock). The same goes for the color-palette. Once I read that the beige strongly polarizes people - they after love it or hate it. And combined with black menu above it looks distressing in my eyes. I'd choose the palette which is often associated with lawyers: dark green or purple, brown (wood), brass/gold etc. And that leads us to the choice of font. What about something what look more 'noble' and 'established' - some serif font? Sure, my suggestions lead to more 'generic'/cliche design but I think that it might build more trust (if not overused). Of course these are my subjective opinions - as always the only way will be to A/B/C test it.",1336331477

Python probably didn't get popular when Guido released it.

They, frankly, make men look better. A suit that fits well makes a man look slimmer, taller and more broader-shouldered. It accentuates his chest. It hides fat and bad composure in ways that T-shirts and polos never can. Ties also make you look taller, and add fantastic unity to the collar.<p>The main reason hats are dead, still, is because there's no gray area for them to come back. Fashion cycles: you have wider ties, then skinnier ties, then wider ties again. But if you stop wearing an accessory completely, it's harder to bring it back. Say, for a second, that no one wore two-piece suits. But people would still wear oxford cloth shirts, khakis, and blazers, which is only a few hops away from a suit. You can wear varying degrees of formal wear, but there are two options for hats: wearing one, or not wearing one. Which means that the man who wears one suddenly finds himself in a start minority...unlike someone who wears a suit in a room full of khakis and oxfords, which is slightly different, but not THAT different.",1336331218

For example, if your model, view and controller have a control flow that makes them three layers in a stack, with the controller sitting between the model and the view, then your architecture is not really anything like MVC at all.<p>The common architectural pattern for web apps where you have a request handler that talks to a database and then generates its output by filling in a template is popular and widely applicable. However, I think the way some of these frameworks tried to hijack a well-established term for publicity in the early days has come back to haunt them now they are better known. Today, if someone wants to learn how to use these web frameworks, particularly the common underlying concepts and design skills, and searches for ""MVC"", they find a whole load of other information that doesn't really make sense in the context of web apps.<p>Similarly, anyone who really does want to learn MVC in a context where it is more applicable -- including designing larger JS-based applications that run primarily in-browser, for example -- comes up against a lot of material that is in some cases almost the antithesis of MVC, which doesn't help there either.<p>When the most common reasonably simple architecture beyond PHP's everything-is-a-template starts off at such a disadvantage, it's not really surprising that many people struggle to understand the basics and just stick with PHP's ""it just works"" instead, despite the other disadvantages they suffer in making that choice.",1336330853

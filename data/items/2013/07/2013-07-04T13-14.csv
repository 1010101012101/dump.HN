5990618,comment,5990342,5990538,6,0,jcastro,,,"I was a Boxee Box early adopter and got it as soon as it came out. I think what crippled it is that what you got with the Box wasn&#x27;t anything like Boxee was before, it was an entirely new Beta UI, and then right around the same time they killed the standalone version. So in one fell swoop I went from an awesome media center to the buggy Boxee Box.<p>Unfortunately the thing just barely worked. They patched over the next few months and eventually it became okayish but at that point it was just too much of a hassle and I returned it. It never met the user experience of the downloaded version + a standalone computer; which is weird because I bought the box to skip the hassles of a normal PC, updates, noise, OS issues, etc.<p>The remote is brilliant though, I bought a standalone version of the remote that I still use today.<p>I mostly use Roku&#x27;s now, and while the older ones were sluggish the new Roku 3 has a nice fast UI that lets me watch what I want. It&#x27;s nice to have a system level search that looks for content on both Netflix and Amazon at the same time.<p>But the Boxee had this awesome feature where it put the content first, the TV show was the top level item. So you would find the show you want, and then it would present you the sources. On the Roku I have to remember if the show I was watching was on Netflix or Amazon. I can&#x27;t imagine content providers would be happy with this though, it basically backshelves their brand.<p>For local content Plex with a Roku is a pretty nice setup.",1372946125

Everything just worked. The remote was unmatched. Simple on one side. Qwerty on the other side, for apps, searches, etc.<p>The box itself played all kinds of file-formats & sources without a hitch. It extracted, identified and unified meta-data much better than any other software I have seen, and auto-combined it into a huge database, all without having performance degraded, like much software does when the library goes big.<p>Everything was great.

Reentrancy gives you thread-safety by default.<p>Yeah, Ruby core data structures are not thread-safe. But that doesn&#x27;t matter. You&#x27;re not supposed to a lot of any data structures between requests anyway. Of the few that are shared (e.g. the Rails cache object), they are explicitly engineered to be thread-safe.<p>There&#x27;s also the story that Ruby cannot use multi-core. That&#x27;s partially correct: on the MRI implementation, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many threads you have, only one can be active at a time. However what you <i>can</i> have is multiple <i>processes</i>, each with multiple threads. Each process can use a different core. Furthermore, the JRuby and Rubinius implementations can handle multi-core with multithreading just fine.

In my eyes it&#x27;s pretty easy. If you have a library that&#x27;s not thread-safe, then just don&#x27;t share that library&#x27;s objects between threads, or ensure that you grab a lock before using that object, and you&#x27;ll be fine.

5990485,comment,5989707,5990217,12,0,tptacek,,,"I hear this all the time but I think it&#x27;s a little verkakte. Here&#x27;s why:<p>First, GPG isn&#x27;t that hard to use. When people say this, I assume they&#x27;re referring to the command-line tools. But nobody advocating GPG for &quot;ordinary people&quot; thinks they should be using the command line tools. Here&#x27;s the day-to-day UX for GPG in Mail.app: (1) ask for acquaintance&#x27;s key, (2) double click it in the email message when it arrives, (3) optionally call acquaintance the first time you use the key to verify it, (4) send acquaintance mail. Depending on your settings, you may need a step (5), &quot;push encryption button in mail composer window&quot;.<p>Second, to the extent that GPG is fussy, it&#x27;s fussy because it&#x27;s trying to solve a difficult problem. Wanting the problem to be easier doesn&#x27;t make it easier. We would all be better off if all mail was opportunistically encrypted (OE was the dream of the late &#x27;90s, where you wouldn&#x27;t even need to ask, and software would just figure out when it was possible to encrypt traffic). But GPG is doing more than OE does, because GPG is guaranteed end-to-end, even in conversations with multiple people. OE-style encryption is not that far from what we already have today with certificate-pinned DHE TLS to Gmail.<p>We could definitely use better UX for PGP (the fact that GPGMail is the best we have right now is telling).<p>But that&#x27;s not what tools like this are; they&#x27;re not a better UX for a proven system. They&#x27;re not even the same kind of system. Cryptocat provides weaker guarantees than GPG does. It&#x27;s simpler to use because it&#x27;s a simpler, less secure system.<p>As to Comic Book Guy voice: yes, that&#x27;s something that happens in infosec. You should be able to see why: it&#x27;s a field populated by nerds that is uniquely adversarial. Bruce Schneier hasn&#x27;t taken that tone with Cryptocat, but he&#x27;s taken it with other people. If you go looking for patronizing, pedantic, dismissive tone in infosec, you&#x27;re sure to find it. But let&#x27;s not lose sight of the fact that the people taking that tone are (a) in this case right and (b) taking the time to communicate that rightness on their own dime.<p>Nobody paid Steve Thomas or Adam Langley to find bugs in Cryptocat.",1372943899

I&#x27;ve seen some people talking about installing Wordpress (and the like) websites for local small companies, and some friends have been advising me to do just that. I&#x27;m studying software engineering and host a (personal) Wordpress, so I&#x27;m familiar with the platform, but I don&#x27;t really know where to start when it comes to doing it for third parties. How personalized should it be? Do I need to take care of the hosting? Should I offer maintenance? How to determine pricing?<p>All in all, are there people out there who experimented with this kind of side business and could share their experience?",1372943240

I&#x27;m really happy to see some developments, because Opera browser always seemed somehow stalled (except for investing resources in strange technologies - e.g. widgets, unite).<p>I&#x27;m afraid that Opera vision is becoming a company serving ads, so the browser will be no longer best choice for power users.<p>The old Opera (till 12.16) just didn&#x27;t have many users, but with new engine Opera could take some users from Chrome. I think this is a step for being attractive for advertisers.<p>Just take a look at Opera business page [1] - the &quot;technology&quot; part just gives historical context, whereas ads/content takes prominient place.<p>I think we&#x27;ll see some innovations from Opera such as mentioned Stash, Discover (another way of promoting partners&#x27; content), etc. But I think in the case of web browser we really need faster horse.<p>What is interesting, Opera published their commits to Chromium and Blink [2] - it seams that only 8 Opera developers work with browser, at least with adopting engine.<p>By the way, Opera 12.16 was released, but you will not find it easily[3].<p>[1]:<a href=""http://business.opera.com/company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.opera.com/company</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://operasoftware.github.io/upstreamtools/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://operasoftware.github.io/upstreamtools/</a><p>[2]:windows: <a href=""http://ftp.opera.com/pub/opera/win/1216/int/Opera_1216_int_Setup_x64.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftp.opera.com/pub/opera/win/1216/int/Opera_1216_int_S...</a>

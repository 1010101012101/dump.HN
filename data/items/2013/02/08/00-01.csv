There has always been a difference between unformatted and formatted space on disks. Look at an old box of 1.44MB floppy disks and you'll clearly see that formatted space and unformatted space are reported separately. The same thing goes for hard drives. What file system you put on the HD can make a difference too.<p>There will always be somewhat less space than the full raw capacity. In this case the problem appears to be shipping large pre-installed software and OS on a smallish SSD. Five years from now when higher capacity is cheaper, no one will even care.",1360285150

The world doesn't work by the fact that you or anyone might have a use for something better than someone else.

Are you going to just give it to them or would you try to make money?  More importantly you seem to assume that ""milk.com"" would be available right when you want it.

Then I would collect this code, and POKE it into place in the C=64 memory, and voila! Magic! The C=64 was so malleable.

And creativity is a must.<p>A recent deal I did was a domain where both the buyer (my client) and the seller agreed to a price ($60,000) and both were happy. I perceived to much eagerness on the part of the seller (the tempo of his replies and his voice on the phone) and as a result managed to get him to lower his price by another $4,000 which almost covered my entire fee. All this w/o the buyer even knowing about it. (I did the entire deal from the start and the start price was $200k and it's a pretty good name actually.)<p>It would be hard to put in words why I decided to take that chance along with the risks etc. (And it didn't put any more money in my pocket I did it just for the fun of following my hunch).<p>On the sell side I once raised a price by $50,000 merely hearing the buyers voice over the phone. That said almost all deals are done by email not in person and not over the phone.

Since then people have invented the laser, the integrated circuit, modern computing, spaceflight, robotics, and have completely overhauled physics at the most complex and creative level.<p>Because of advances in mathematics and physical theory, we now know that most of our earlier assumptions about the universe were wrong -- we only understand 4% of the universe's mass-energy, which leaves a huge playground for genius, and there are plenty of very smart people trying to craft theories to match the new observations.<p>The problem is not a shortage of very smart people, the problem is that most modern science is <i>applied</i>. The resources available for pure research -- the kind of research that produces entirely new fields of knowledge -- is much smaller as a percentage of total science spending than it was in the past.<p>There is every indication that the probability for the appearance of a very bright person is either unchanged, or greater than the past.

Less serious users, who don't need the extra capability, have no reason to look at it over an iPad.<p>Also, don't forget about how 7"" tablets factor into the equation, because they make it more practical to carry a laptop + tablet.

5185497,comment,5185122,5185248,40,0,potatolicious,,,"iCloud in general ""just works"". It was pretty terrible from the get-go, from reliability to really egregious bugs in the OS, but at this point is pretty stable.<p>The real problem here is the combination of iCloud and Core Data (for non-Apple folks, the built-in persistence/object model framework).<p>In a somewhat simplified way, Core Data is a data store most commonly backed by SQLite. It's used everywhere from your mail app to the Facebook app. It's handy and convenient when it isn't trying to kill you - it's one of the more complex frameworks that Apple ships, and the documentation is <i>extremely</i> poor for it. It also doesn't help that there is a <i>lot</i> of quirky behavior that's more or less tribal knowledge to long-time Apple devs and WWDC attendees, and is has enough concurrency gotchas to fill a container ship.<p>So, Core Data is not the simplest piece of code to work with from the get-go, and then you pile iCloud on top.<p>iCloud is conceptually pretty simple - there's a directory on your file system that is replicated to Apple's servers, and back down to each one of your devices. When files change the OS sends notifications to your app informing you of such. If you're using iCloud as a distributed file system (a la Dropbox), it's easy to integrate.<p>The trouble with this model is that Core Data stores can be in fact quite large. If you have a 30MB database of, say, recipes on your disk, you really don't want to resend the whole thing every time your user alters a row. Apple special-cases Core Data stores in iCloud by sending only deltas, but the implementation is utterly broken:<p>- There is no baseline state(s). The database is literally the playback of every delta, with no canonical snapshots. Ever.<p>- iCloud is really bad at sequencing the deltas, especially if (somewhat) concurrent changes are happening. Core Data is also <i>terrifyingly bad</i> at conflict resolution when deltas from different devices don't line up.<p>- The above points means that it's <i>trivially easy</i> to break your entire database, as your deltas no longer play back to a sane database file. When this occurs there is no way to roll back your database, since there is no concept of a snapshot or last known good state.<p>- This is compounded by some really horrible API design on Apple's part. When your iCloud database becomes corrupt <i>it fails silently</i>, with absolutely <i>no</i> API that allows one to determine said broken state. Your app literally stops working with none of the OS making a single peep, and no way for you to proactively check your database's state. iCloud seems to print some debug things into your console indicating this failure, but neither your app nor your users have access to it. This manifests in your app (and in tech support requests) as ""iCloud just stopped syncing"" - your device stops transmitting deltas and simply works off of the last locally-cached good state, all without telling the dev or the user.<p>- This is further compounded by the fact that the entirety of Core Data+iCloud was rushed out the door. Documentation was non-existent even up to the day the new version of iOS went out to the public. There was literally only one source of information: a thread on the Apple dev forums that Apple engineers would sometimes pop into.<p>- This is further compounded by the fact that even the Apple engineers themselves seemed to have no idea how to implement an app with iCloud + Core Data. The example code (provided deep, deep within aforementioned thread) made 90 degree turns seemingly every few days. The same sample would have <i>dramatically</i> changing implementations from week to week. The Apple engineers in the thread seemed as mystified as the people trying to use the framework.<p>- The poor documentation and poor state of sample code, as well as what is IMO a fundamentally broken architecture means that iCloud + Core Data remains a complete nightmare to this day. I think the poor architecture is really the core of this here - while Apple could have provided better docs and better support, I believe the fundamental architecture choices made here means Core Data + iCloud would never have been workable.<p>- The icing on top of the cake was an extremely egregious bug that existed at launch (unsure now, you couldn't pay me enough money to work with that API ever again). ""Okay, so our deltas are completely fucked"" you say, ""Why don't we just delete the app's entire iCloud bucket and start over?""<p>A jolly good idea until you realize that a bug in iOS/iCloud means that <i>when you delete an app's iCloud storage ""bin"", it cannot be recreated by that app, ever again</i>.",1360283665

As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my body; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was half-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons, and that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my remaining respect for it, and pitied it.<p>Thus the State never intentionally confronts a man's sense, intellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed with superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can force me who obey a higher law than I. They force me to become like themselves. I do not hear of men being forced to have this way or that by masses of men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet a government which says to me, ""Your money or your life,"" why should I be in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not know what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do. It is not worth the while to snivel about it. I am not responsible for the successful working of the machinery of society. I am not the son of the engineer. I perceive that, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but both obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they can, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a plant cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.",1360283553

Besides, it is not like Apple would have a problem with debt financing if they decided to make a major acquisition (a scenario that I find unlikely, anyway).<p>What to do with the cash is a bit of a harder problem, though. The default option should be to give it back to the investors as a dividend or share repurchase. I would actually go with the latter as I think Apple is oversold/undervalued at the moment. I was thinking of selling, but now I am thinking of buying, again.<p>On the other hand, I am not particularly convinced by the ""social good"" argument of the article; this is business, after all. The author is right, though, that there is certainly an opportunity to try something wild (and huge) which could change the world (and possibly make even more money for the investors). That sounds like a very Steve Jobs thing to do.

Don't bother quibbling about this: it is simply not up for discussion and you are wasting your time trying to claim that I am wrong for it.<p>Apple restricts some features from OS updates in ways I do not appreciate, sure. And it was a factor in me going to Google's Nexus device line. But it was a small factor because, in practice, Apple doing so was not a significant issue--I didn't care about Siri and Apple's messaging toward third-party development meant that I still got third-party applications that interested me that could run on my iPhone 4. Microsoft is not encouraging people to develop for WP7. It is a second-class citizen at best because WP8 is out, it is the new hotness, and <i>no, WP7 loyalists, you can't have it</i>. And there is nothing to indicate that they won't do the same for WP9. Or WP10.

His team had figured out how to tightly pack such batteries into both space-going and earthly vehicles. He was happy to pass along lessons learned. Boeing replied that the situation is under control, Musk said.<p>Now, Boeing appears to have reconsidered. Though it is not saying so explicitly, it seems to be looking at Musks main advicereducing the chance of fire hazard by increasing the space (paywall) between the lithium-ion cells in the battery pack, according to the Wall Street Journal.<p>A Musk fan site is crowing about Boeings possible about-face.<p>The reporting on Musk gets one thing wronghis Tesla automobiles do not use the lithium-cobalt-oxide chemistry that is in the Dreamliner batteries. They rely on Panasonic nickel-cobalt-aluminum lithium-ion batteries, which may be less volatile.<p>In the end, that may not be a crucial difference, one battery scientist told meI would be the first to say that there are safer battery chemistries available than [Boeing's lithium-cobalt-oxide], he said, but if you know what youre dealing with, you can make a system safe.<p>Yet it may be at least partly about perception. Why choose the most volatile of all the standard lithium-ion configurations when, in a crisis, that could turn into a public relations nightmare?<p>Generally speaking, battery scientists will speak only not-for-attribution on the 787 issue. In some cases this is because they have been hired by Boeing as consultants to figure out what went wrong. The one quoted above doesnt want to be identified.<p>But he also thinks that, contrary to what some reports have suggested, Boeing has made progress in figuring out the root cause of the problem with the Dreamliners. The process of elimination does rule out many possible root causes and gets you closer to the answer, the scientist said. Im sure they have a short list thats getting shorter by the day.",1360281950

In such a case, Hardware failures are probably going to be the most prevalent mode of failure for needing a system re-image, since software usage is going to be in-line with corporate policies. People aren't going to venture into warez sites, etc.<p>But for the average, non-technical user, I think you'd see a much higher incidence of needing a system re-image due to viruses, malware, spyware, etc.",1360281908

The Marketing GM is a total tool without a clue who basically destroyed everything he touched, hence the toxic place to work you experienced.  He's gone, things are much better now, and that San Bruno office is finally being put to rest.  When he said he promoted too many of his own people too fast, he nailed it, but not because of some image or trust problem within the new company, they just weren't very good at all.",1360281881

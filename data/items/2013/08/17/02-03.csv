(But some things would be easier to launch externally.)<p>- Part of the attraction, like for open source projects, is that it&#x27;s something different from your main job, so you learn and stay fresh. If you turn it into your main job you lose that.<p>The theory is that if you do work on a new product and it works well, eventually it will be staffed full-time and you&#x27;ll be rewarded.

6227972,comment,6225479,6226749,5,0,JimmaDaRustla,,,"There are two types of discharge states - typically &quot;fully discharge&quot; implies within the application the battery was designed, not completely dead. For example, a car battery is fully charged at 12.6v, but discharged at 11.2 (or somewhere around there). There is still lots of capacity left, but dead for the use of cranking over an engine. NiMH typically has a very fast self discharge rate - letting these dip well below the operational capacity level will be much more detrimental than just letting your drill die after prolonged use.<p>NiMH has memory too, but not as bad as NiCd. We always suggested allowing NiMH to fully discharge time to time, but we never suggested keeping a phone on its base constantly.<p>Both these types of batteries need to be primed properly - full discharge/recharge the first few cycles.

He was only convicted on a portion of those. In any event.<p><i>That being said</i>, It may have <likely> been the case that (1) Nacchio may have had access to information that (if made public) could have compromised/damaged the NSA&#x27;s institutional interests and/or the reputation of its principals; and (2) he may well have threatened to make such information to become public.  But (1) comes with the territory or running a bell operating company (US west); and (2) comes with the territory of being a desperate, CEO about to be thrown in Jail. Since these alternative explanations are alot simpler and easy to make sense of, Its not worth walking out on a limb to support the alternative hypothesis that the NSA somehow framed Nacchio. It would be (at best) like framing al capone for tax evasion, understanding it also to be a fact that he did evade taxes.",1376706577

1896771,comment,1892550,1893507,0,0,throwaway1675,,,"This is clearly flame bait / troll comment, but I would like to make a comment to rebut the central point, namely that personal relationships somehow ""do not matter"" or are purely exploitative at organizations.<p>First, I've found that one's work experience is dependent to a huge degree on the direct manager. If your manager is an asshole, you will hate your job. If you don't get along with your manager, you will dislike your job. If your manager does not care about you, you will dislike your job. If you work at an enlightened organization, you may be able to raise the issue up the chain with your manger's manager and apply for a transfer. Otherwise it is best to find another job.<p>That was the practical angle. Here is the theoretical one: if you call ""social capital"" the propensity of employees to form relationships, care about each other, and be loyal to each other, then the argument put forth is that low social capital corporations will somehow be better adapted than high social capital ones and will push them out of existence Darwin-like. This simply hasn't happened - Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple are all examples of places that by and large treat their employees fairly. I've heard that Oracle is more ""cut throat"" but I don't really know what that means in practice and have never worked there. Oracle does, however, seem to suffer from Ellison's weirdness. Just as there is a market in employee salaries there is also a market in corporate culture - a company that is not nice is not going to attract top talent. I have never heard that Oracle has attracted a substantial number of top-notch engineers.<p>On a personal level, it is always advantageous to be friendly, nice, respectful, and take everything in stride because it wins you friends and lets you do things like get other companies to hire you, a process which increases your market value as an employee. It is also completely free.<p>Keep in mind that this is specific to large tech companies - other sectors like Finance and Sales are going to obey their own cultural trends which may be more selfish and greedy. The start-up sector tends to attract and encourage a rather different breed, but the conditions are also completely different from a traditional corporate environment, so different personality characteristics will be adaptive.",1289543931

I don't believe anyone is truly claiming the latter is the case. I'll take him up on the challenge the former though. 5 years ago I knew absolutely nothing about programming. I decided I wanted to learn. I started spending few hours a day on learning new things, doing exercises, taking classes and doing projects.

Plenty of people seem to operate under a false dichotomy between code and business, where ""not programming"" gets treated as a business skill.   I consider myself a hybrid hacker/businessman, but stronger on the hacker side for now.  If I am to take a ""business person"" as a partner, I'm looking for that person to do things I couldn't learn easily from a day of reading.  This could mean lots of things: truly understanding markets and pricing, being a professional member of a specialized target market, legal and accounting training, unlimited patience for customer support, etc.<p>I see some ""business"" people making the same mistakes they're supposed to prevent.  The stereotype is of a programmer who builds and builds without testing the market, but how many non-programmers try to recruit techs to hack together a totally untested but ""revolutionary"" idea?<p>Another thing I've gotten wiser to is the use of vague terms, like ""leadership"" and ""networking.""  To me this comes off as ""I wanna be the boss and hang out.""  If you really are good at these things, try to give some specifics.<p>Finally, if I wanted to have a boss and live in a hole, I'd get a job at X big corporation.  This is the point I expect the most disagreement on.  I don't want a business founder who will ""take over"" all of the networking.  By deciding to be a founder, I've already bet that I can manage myself better than someone else can manage me.",1289542318

Nine years later, he became the U.S. chess champion.</i><p>What's the mystery there?  Bobby Fischer was completely obsessed with chess and played and studied it incessantly.<p>9 years of manic dedication and he ""suddenly"" got good.<p>His mother spoke something like 8 languages and his father was a Hungarian physicist who headed the Theoretical Mechanics section of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory and was an expert in elasticity and fluid dynamics.<p>One famous story about his memory:<p>""One day when he was in Iceland, Fischer called Frederick Olaffson, Iceland's only Grandmaster. Olaffson's Icelandic-speaking daughter answered the phone and explained her parents were out and would return at suppertime. Fischer understood nothing that was said because he did not know the language. But he listened, apologized and hung up. Later that day Fischer met with another Icelandic player who spoke English. He explained what had happened and repeated every Icelandic word he had heard on the phone, imitating the sounds with perfect inflection. The Icelandic player translated the message word for word for Fischer.""<p>Despite being prodigiously ""intelligent"", it still took years of dedication to get good, and years more to get <i>really</i> good.<p>Plenty of average people undoubtedly beat him at chess when he was a kid.  When you think about it, it should be obvious that he was <i>always</i> that smart.  Just because you're a kid and don't know anything yet doesn't mean you aren't <i>smart</i>.   ""Smarts"" is not the same as <i>skill</i>.<p>Incidentally, his record as the youngest grandmaster in history lasted for many years until it was broken by Judit Polgar, whose father was explicitly running an experiment with his daughters to prove that prodigies are made, not born.  All three daughters became chess experts.  He explained that Judit, the youngest, was the most successful because <i>she worked the hardest</i>.  She's the only female ever ranked in the top-10 of the ""Men's"" ratings list.<p>Since then, many people have gone on to break the youngest-grandmaster record at younger and younger ages.  I can only assume that if being a classical composer had as much of a ""lobby"" as chess (parents pushing their children into it, reward structures), we'd see more Mozarts as well.<p>The reason it takes HARD work is because even geniuses aren't that genius.  If you look at the top level of any objectively measurable and well-subscribed field, there is generally less than a 1% difference between the best, whether it's sprinting, bike racing, weight lifting, or chess.<p>Knowledge builds on knowledge and skill builds on skill.  If you think of it like compound interest, a few percent difference between two individuals at any given moment eventually turns into a huge dividend a decade or three later.<p>For chess, if you take two average players rated 1500 each, and one improves at 2% ""interest"" and the other at 4% ""interest"", in 10 years the former player will be rated in the 1800s (moving from class C to class A), and the latter will be rated in the 2200s (National Master).<p>To become a Grandmaster (typically 2500+) in 10 years, that's an ""interest"" rate of about 5.3%.<p>Meanwhile, a super-genius with a 7% compounding rate who puts in 7 years and then burns out will be stuck at ~2400, International Master level.<p>Humans occupy a pretty narrow raw talent niche.  The best people tend to be pretty tightly clustered together.  I'm not smarter than I was when I was young, but I have compounded YEARS of knowledge and experience to the point where I can vastly outperform my younger, smarter self.",1289542138

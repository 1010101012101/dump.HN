Handmade meant crummy and for poor people, whereas something from a production belt meant precision-engineered. But now that everyone can afford, say, a quality solid-state amplifier, suddenly it&#x27;s hip to have the expensive point-to-point tube amp again. It&#x27;s really about status and conspicuous consumption, but the snobbery is hidden behind notions of quality and authenticity.<p>Now let&#x27;s circle back to software. High-level programming languages, interpreted languages, libraries, frameworks... all used to be really cool. Until people realized that now everyone can learn how to code, so there&#x27;s a need for something to separate the elite from the plebeians, something to separate the software engineers from the script kiddies... how about handmade programming, maybe that&#x27;ll do the trick?",1440165587

Well, until you reach the limit of what async code does, but that limit is quite high.<p>Typically a request thread that ends up blocking on I/O in some way (like accessing a database) sits there doing absolutely nothing for a very long time.  The time it takes to get data from a database could be spent servicing many, many more requests!  Async does just that.  And before you ask, it doesn&#x27;t spawn off any threads ... it leverages the asynchronous nature of the operating system to service I/O requests.  It&#x27;s actually really, really rad.<p>> Usually seems to be a premature optimization<p>If you have a user-facing system, it&#x27;s most definitely not a premature optimization.

Yet, the C class (not only of my course, but of some others too, or of other years) frequently outperformed the A and B classes, even if their students were frequently obviously outright dumb... The reason is that the C class students learned to do two things: one, work hard, including being very creative in cheating if needed, C class students never shied from hard work if it was needed, and two, they were really, really good at being friends of teachers and other staff, and socialize their way into success.<p>The A class, that theoretically had the best students (example of difference: A class students frequently already had past experience in the job we were learning, and was the class that least needed to ask questions to teachers, also in simple enough tests always scored very high), but it don&#x27;t worked, most A class students didn&#x27;t knew how to hard work, they would just coast, and when some advanced teamworking was needed (example: team of 7 students asked to make a 6 month long project that would affect the grades of all subjects), the A class students would often start to fight each other (sometimes physically), have big egos, don&#x27;t cooperate, and so on.<p>Altough this is what I saw from personal experience, I got curious and looked more into it, and saw this everywhere, the smartest kids fail in real life, they don&#x27;t work hard, don&#x27;t socialize decently, and when facing a big challenge they fail, they panic, or get confused, or procastinate or lot, or give up before even starting.<p>The &quot;C class&quot; kids although they often are the typical party animals (frequently going to bars, getting drunk, being rowdy, skipping unecessary work, etc...) when they face a challenge, they take it, they work hard, either to do it the right way, or to do it the wrong way, or to figure how to avoid it completely, but they don&#x27;t give up, they just figure how to do it somehow.<p>Practical final example: I once went to some seminars in a hard to understand subject, the speakers were all students, it was mandatory to all students to speak. The brightest students, gave boring seminars, everything was correct, but not really detailed, and the work was clearly half-assed. Now, watching the seminars of the students that were infamous for being often drunkards and dumb was awesome, some of these just creatively figured a way to nail it. One guy gave a really, really awesome seminar, 100% correct, 100% charismatic, and very detailed. Later I learned that what he did was meticulously create a script for the seminar using his comedy skills to copy, paste and edit parts of books, then record himself reading the script, then play that recording during the seminar while hiding the headphone on his hair, it is work intensive, and he don&#x27;t understood half of what he said, but he got a 10 of 10 grade, and I understood the subject he needed to teach very well. Another guy just tried to learn everything he needed to say like if he was an actor, and just acted his way through, he also don&#x27;t understood shit of what he said, but everyone else did, and he got a 9.5 of 10",1440164765

I&#x27;m also a graduate of the <a href=""http://bloc.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bloc.io</a> full-stack apprenticeship.<p>If I&#x27;m not mistaking, the current software &quot;craftsman&quot; and &quot;apprenticeship&quot; movement has been largely influenced by Dave Hoover&#x27;s Apprenticeship Patterns (free on the web): <a href=""http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.ht...</a><p>A few quotes from that book:<p>============================================================<p>This book is written for software apprentices—for people who have had a taste of developing software and want to take it further, but need some guidance. Whether you have a college degree from a prestigious computer science program or are entirely self-taught, you recognize that there are great developers out there, and you aspire to achieve the same mastery that they possess.<p>...<p>When discussing what it means to be an apprentice, Marten Gustafson, one of our interviewees, put it best when he said, “I guess it basically means having the attitude that there’s always a better/smarter/faster way to do what you just did and what you’re currently doing. Apprenticeship is the state/process of evolving and looking for better ways and finding people, companies and situations that force you to learn those better/smarter/faster ways.” We think there’s a lot of value in having this internal drive that is not dependent on anyone else to bestow solutions upon you, and that leads you to find constructive ways of dealing with problems.<p>...<p>Apprenticeship is the beginning of your journey as a software craftsman. During this time you will be primarily focused inward, intent on growing your craftsmanship. While you will benefit from the attention of your peers and more experienced developers, you must learn to grow yourself, to learn how you learn. This focus on yourself and your need to grow is the essence of what it means to be an apprentice.<p>============================================================<p>In my mind, the key difference between an internship and apprenticeship is the focus and purpose. Generally, a company hires an intern as a cheap way to get extra help. Sure, they will help the intern as needed, but primarily so they can accomplish something for the company.<p>Whereas, when a company takes on an apprentice, the primary focus is on providing an awesome, safe learning environment. Sure, the apprentice will likely do something of value for the company, but that&#x27;s a side benefit.<p>Also, generally people think internship == work while apprenticeship == learning.<p>So technically there may not be a lot of difference, but I argue that the difference in paradigms has a large impact.<p>---<p>I&#x27;m not familiar but any of the other apprenticeships, but Sparkbox&#x27;s is much better than what&#x27;s generally being discussed in the other comments here. You don&#x27;t need to already have significant experience to join. All you need is an interest in web development.

Some of those quotes will be old so you have some logic that removes them so to keep the ticker marquee fresh. While the method responsible for culling ticker quotes need not be asynchronous the method responsible for getting the ticker quotes themselves may be best suited for an asynchronous call if the data source is remote (like a web service). This way the rest of your application can still do whatever tasks that are essential while the ticker quotes trickle in from the async method.

In the exception handling example it is not clear if all the failures are caught, or if they are more that are meant to be caught at higher levels, or perhaps exceptions were forgotten.

Exceptions should be used when it&#x27;s lights-out important that something Really Bad be handled or the program will be killed.

The exception-based isomorphism to the usual returned-error handling style would look something like:<p><pre><code>    try:\n        a_single_statement_here()\n    except:\n        if exception.type == &quot;A&quot;:\n            #yada yada\n        elsif exception.type == &quot;B&quot;:\n            #yada yada\n        else:\n            raise\n</code></pre>\nExceptions by contrast encourage putting a lot of statements together, and much less frequently checking for what the exception may be, and capturing fewer of them. The code snippet above is bad exception style because you shouldn&#x27;t be putting a try around every statement like that.<p>Exceptions expressed in the error handling modality probably look something more like:<p><pre><code>    val, err = func()\n    goto EXCEPTION if err\n    nextval, err = func2(val)\n    goto EXCEPTION if err\n    # etc etc, for the whole &quot;try&quot; block\n\n    return goodval\n\n    EXCEPTION: {\n        if err.type == &quot;A&quot; { ... }\n        if err.type == &quot;B&quot; { ... }\n        return err\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwhich is, intriguingly, also very bad style for an error-returning language; the EXCEPTION block must be written excessively generically, when in fact the error handling may in fact care about the difference between whether the error came from func or func2, and may even want to take different actions (especially w.r.t. retrying). You can of course write those different actions into an exception block, but the style discourages that... your code starts to look messier (as nice as exceptions can be, they&#x27;re syntactically pretty heavy, and also difficult to factor out the way that error-return handling can be factored out with monads and such (albeit not in Go so much)), it takes more work, so you&#x27;re less inclined to do it.<p>It remains unclear to me what &quot;the best&quot; is. Error-returning code is, both in theory and in my practice, more correct, in terms of the programming style it affords; it turns out that in ways you won&#x27;t see if you&#x27;ve only ever done exceptions-based code that your exception handlers are often incorrect, overly generic, and missing opportunities to intelligently handle bugs. The flip side is that all that extra handling is of course expensive, and it&#x27;s not 100% clear that it&#x27;s worth the expense, and exception code, while IMHO clearly generally less correct in both theory and practice, is equally clearly often &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>I find myself wondering if some of the divisions of opinion come from different environments. In a conventional GUI program, I favor the exceptions; frankly so much stuff can go wrong that an enumeration of all possible failures is very difficult to produce, and your answer to almost all of them is likely to be identical (&quot;scream an error to the user and hope they can fix it&quot;). In a network server, I <i>heavily</i> favor the error returning paradigm; in my mature Go codebases that are network servers, I took a survey once and about 1/3rd of the lines that received an error immediately <i>did something</i> with them, other than simply passing them up the stack. Converting that to exceptions would actually lengthen the program and be a royal pain to deal with going forward.",1440162751

Here&#x27;s the overview:<p>- When you select a deck, you study words 10 at a time in &quot;learn&quot; mode.<p>-- In &quot;learn&quot; mode, you have to get the flashcard correct 3 times in a row, at which point they are &quot;learned&quot;.<p>- Every day, you&#x27;ll be given a set of cards you&#x27;ve learned to &quot;review&quot;.<p>- These cards use a form of spaced repetition. In order to make spaced repetition more approachable, I don&#x27;t use time intervals in the same way apps like Anki do. Instead, each card has a level, and as you progress through the levels, the interval at which they appear increases. Each level takes three steps to get through, each of which has its own interval.<p>-- Level 1: 1 day, 2 days, 3 days.<p>-- Level 2: 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks<p>-- Level 3: 1 month, 2 months, 3 months<p>-- Level 4: 6 months, 9 months, 1 year<p>-- Level 5: Never show again<p>- If you mark a word wrong at Level 1, it drops down to Level 0, where it will keep showing up in that same session periodically until you&#x27;ve marked it correct enough to move it back to Level 1.<p>- Getting through your daily set of review cards is encouraged as being the most important thing, adding new cards is secondary.<p>- We don&#x27;t want to discourage people from coming back, even if they got lazy and stopped studying for a month. So we never build up a huge pile of flashcards for people to review.<p>Give it a try if you have a chance, and if you have any thoughts/suggestions I&#x27;d love to hear them!",1440162501

This was after an encouter with ZFS&#x27;s horrendous performance with dedup enabled. btrfs at least lets you manually dedup (which works fine for my purposes--I rely heavily on hashdeep in my workflows already and it&#x27;s trival to locate duplicates in hashdeep inventories).<p>My sense is that it&#x27;s the more exotic parts of btrfs (i.e. the native RAID but not-RAID-0/1 parts, esp the stuff intended to be in the RAID-z alternates) that have the most issues.<p>But ext4 doesn&#x27;t natively support any of that either, so maybe any place you would consider using ext4, btrfs is potentially ok as an alternative. I mean if you approach it as ext4 with a few very useful missing features I think you hit the most useful and widely used corners. You can still use md etc. I&#x27;m not talking about datacenter scale things, I&#x27;m talking workstations and laptops.<p>I currently run a zfs-on-linux RAID-1 and have been testing btrfs for one of my backup copies. There are parts of btrfs things seem to work fine and that I really like a lot compared to the ZFS versions. I&#x27;m a bit paranoid about data loss and corruption (I do research with large sets of medical images, it&#x27;s sort of like video except the data is typically very compressible, but few tools work with compressed images--filesystem-level compression is great for this stuff) so I keep hashdeep inventories of everything to document provenance. One thing about medical image processing workflows is you easily end up with multiple copies of images in different directories. I hoped to use ZFS deduplication for this but it is a nightmare. With btrfs you at least have the option of safely deduping files manually using the (cp --reflink) so you can dedup periodically (or even based on knowledge of how the data is layed out in the filesystem) or add it into workflow scripts which works well.<p>Unfortunately, the one thing that I haven&#x27;t figured out is how to make a bit-by-bit clone of an existing btrfs filesystem. You can dd, but that leads to issues because device UUIDs are imbedded into the metadata. Working on btrfs, I&#x27;ve managed to consolidate 5.1TB of data that includes very compressible source images, duplacates and a lot of text files into 1.2TB, but I can&#x27;t figure out how to correctly duplicate the 1.2TB version of the data without it transiently exploding back to 5.1TB in the process.<p>I do like the way ZFS approches the concept and organization of &quot;datasets&quot; better than btrfs&#x27;s approach though. btrfs&#x27;s approach seems more adhoc and less opinionated. I think if you lack discipline and experience with large datasets, btrfs can enable you to do unwise things that will seriously bite you in the butt down the road, whereas ZFS enforces some discipline. I think it&#x27;s probably because ZFS was designed by people that have seen hell.",1440162071

There are too many sites like this on the internet designed for google and thrown together to make a quick buck.  The kid seems like he has at least some ability to code, why not put that towards something with a little more value-added.",1201384789

104741,comment,104727,104727,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is probably the first genuinely valuable article I've read on OnStartups. This is dead-on, and cuts across pretty much every aspect of running a software company:<p>* Engineering --- BigCo rockstars can be process-bound, require 30 page MRDs to start projects, and gummed up in the tar-pit dev platform choices of their previous project; your startup should not be using J2EE or ACE.<p>* Marketing --- You know you're fucked when you're pre-revenue and your marketing plan involves dropping 20k on vanity booth kits to take to conferences, or when your marcom person spends more money on mailing lists than on organizing meetups.<p>* Sales --- Just having an account manager backs you into a corner on pricing; now you have to make 50k off a customer to make them ""worth having"". BigCo sales rockstars need armies of sales engineers to be effective, and may spend more time selling you on why they should be promoted to Global All-Encompassing Executive VP Of Worldwide Sales.<p>A big difference between Microsoft and your company is that, for better or worse, everything inside of Microsoft is at least designed to help people do what Microsoft thinks will improve shareholder value. At a BigCo, you can work your MRDs and add $50MM to the year. Nothing at your company is designed to make people successful. If you sit back and do what you're supposed to do at a startup, you die.",1201384379

The first page :scaffold section of just about every beginning Rails tutorial is broken in Rails 2.<p>Lots of little things are changed. Some of them are confusing and hard to decipher when tutorials and message boards say things should be working when they're not.",1201384307

104736,comment,104733,104733,0,0,bmaier,,,"My other comments were edited since I sort of feel bad about jumping all over it...  Theres normally so much sleaze associated with credit card marketing in general that it is hard not to jump on it sometimes... For starters, your plesk login page is indexed by Google.  Probably not the best idea for site security.<p>After that if the site is to work you need to make sure you keep it really pure and unbiased.  Don't allow users to submit affiliate links, put strict controls on user ratings and don't allow small groups to drastically affect the site.  Inherently the site sets itself up to be abused by marketers but if you can put strict enough controls in place to keep it relatively unbiased you have the potential to create a decent resource.",1201383849

I'm a rare bird, I guess, in the sense that I'm usually looking for answers about other people's systems, and so I'm dealing with hundreds of hardware, OS, version, etc. differences.  Most folks only ever deal with a few such variants at any given time.  Nonetheless, I can see this being a very useful service...not a terribly profitable one (at least in its early stages), but extremely useful.  Assuming people use it, of course.",1201383334

104725,comment,104361,104361,0,0,neilk,,,"This is worse than the first article.<p>They seem to be conflating the use of a high-level, SQL-like language with the architecture of the system. Of course you could layer a SQL-like language on top of a MapReduce-based storage and processing array, and for some queries that would be very user-friendly. If that is their whole point it is true but trivial.<p>I think BigTable does have a limited join capability now.<p>The real difference between a MapReduce-oriented system and typical SQL storage options is something like this. MR gives you assured scalability at the cost of limiting what kinds of queries you can do, and as the authors correctly point out, some queries get more and more onerous to create. Usually, SQL storage engines place ease of querying above all else, but have to go through painful and expensive procedures to scale well.",1201382394

Think of the original context of ""critical mass"": nuclear reactions. No one fissible atom need be a ""super-influencer"" -- just getting enough identical atoms in the same space results in the desired chain reaction.",1201381608

In hockey, you have line changes every couple minutes, so when they are out there on the ice, they are going balls-to-the-wall the majority of the time.  None of this jogging around, diving, booting the ball out of bounds, conserving energy that you see in pro soccer, because the players <i>have</i> to play the entire game, barring one or two rare substitutions.<p>When I played in high school, our soccer league had unlimited substitutions, and, even though the skill level was pretty low, the games were more entertaining to watch than professional soccer, because people were actually trying.

I&#x27;ve absolutely encountered servers and other long-lived apps written in C++ that suffer from heap fragmentation, and required serious attention from skilled developers to try and fix things (sometimes by adding or removing fields from structures). It can be a huge time sink because the code isn&#x27;t actually buggy and the problem is often not easily localised to one section of code. It&#x27;s not common that you encounter big firefighting efforts though, because often for a server it&#x27;s easier to just restart it in this sort of situation.<p>As an example, Windows has a special malloc called the &quot;low fragmentation heap&quot; specifically to help fight this kind of problem - if fragmentation was never an issue in practice, such a feature would not exist.<p>CMS was never designed for 100GB+ heaps so I am not surprised your experience was poor. G1 can handle such heaps although the Intel/HBase presentation suggested aiming for more like 100msec pause times is reasonable there.<p>The main thing I&#x27;d guess you have to watch out for with huge Go heaps is how long it takes to complete a collection. If it&#x27;s really scanning the entire heap in each collection then I&#x27;d guess you can outrun the GC quite easily if your allocation rate is high.",1454579012

However, it doesn&#x27;t follow that everyone should own a home, or that rent is somehow evil.<p>If you rent, you pay rent.  If you own, you pay interest on a loan[1] and maintenance costs.  There is also a forced savings component in the form of mortgage principle payments.  There are also less tangible benefits to both renting and owning.  Renting is entirely flexible and allows you to relocate with ease.  Owning gives more flexibility in customizing your home.  Different people will ascribe different values to these benefits.  Especially for someone who does not yet know where they want to settle long term, renting might be very attractive.<p>Because of the forced savings aspect of owning, renting will almost always be cheaper on a cash-flow basis.  Therefore, if a person earns a middle class income[2] and is fiscally responsible, it provides an opportunity to put money into a diversified, low-cost investment portfolio.  Eventually, that portfolio should grow to the point where purchasing a modest home is possible.  What&#x27;s more, it will hopefully start a habit that will continue through life, and eventually provide for a comfortable retirement.<p>So again, I absolutely agree with you that finding a way to better teach smart personal finance is critical.  I just don&#x27;t see at all how it follows that everyone must own a home (immediately).<p>[1] Or if you own outright, you pay the opportunity cost on funds that could be invested elsewhere.<p>[2] Obviously at a certain level of poverty, there simply is no additional money to put away, even after any discretionary spending is cut.

Even though you could use cgo... in my experience, most neuroscientists aren&#x27;t that into fixing their tools.

The loan was for the land itself, and I planned to self-fund the house construction. So, I was looking at property that cost around $75k, and was hoping to get a loan for $50k of that (with $25k down). The tiny house was not at all part of the equation on the loan (except in the sense that had I been planning to put a big house on the land and was contracting a home builder to do it, the bank might have treated it more like a regular house and been willing to loan me money).<p>But, yes, part of the problem is that land has much less predictable resale value than houses, and that was the usual answer I got when being told, &quot;No&quot;.",1454576435

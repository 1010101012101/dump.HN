10769850,comment,10769538,10769538,0,0,edanm,,,"This is a terrible article, and I have to say that I&#x27;m not enjoying the reaction here either.<p>Take out the alarmist language, the &quot;SuperBoss&quot; title and the fact that this article talks about CEOs, and what this article is saying is that some people get up early and exercise. Is that so horrible and unhealthy? Exercising in the morning sounds like a <i>good</i> thing, even something most doctors would recommend!<p>But the article phrases everything to sound so ominous:<p>- CEOs don&#x27;t get up early to exercise, they get up early to &quot;exercise furiously&quot;. Every day that the gym I see dozens of people with me, are they all exercising &quot;furiously&quot;?<p>- They mention a CEO who, while exercising, &quot;looks at e-mail, surfs the web, watches tv&quot; [paraphrase, not direct quote]. No kidding, <i>everyone</i> does that! There&#x27;s music playing in the gym, there are TVs in the gym, and who the hell <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> glance at their phones to check emails once in a while? This literally describes the behavior of 90% of the people at the gym.<p>- The article keeps harping about the time CEOs get up, but they never even mention when they go to sleep. What if all these crazy CEOs that get up at 5am, also go to sleep at 10pm? Changes the picture somewhat, no? You&#x27;d expect a decent article to at least <i>mention</i> this.<p>Seriously, most of the behaviors in the article describe me and half the people I know who try to live a healthy lifestyle by exercising in the morning, and all these prescriptions at the end of the article of how business will fail if the CEOs are always exhausted are just flat out ridiculous. Getting up early to exercise gives me and most people an energy boost, and we&#x27;re definitely healthier for it.",1450678241

CEOs need to appear like they are valuable.<p>This is truly sagacious statement. Modern CEOs represent almost none of the value generation for the companies described <i>except</i> for the part where things are sold or money is solicited. Perhaps that is a cruel and thoughtless quantification of corporate leadership, but I&#x27;ve worked for some truly bad and even gross leaders. People who offered me hard drugs for performance. People who revealed company secrets to sound good in interviews. People who proudly posted about their underage sex tourism on facebook. Bad people. So I don&#x27;t put much stock in it.<p>So, I suspect that this is a compensation for the other fact: CEOs are hiring and then selling that team. CEOs claim to recruit, lead and inspire their talent. They&#x27;re all too aware of what&#x27;s actually critical to the functioning of a company. They&#x27;re all too aware of who they can&#x27;t lose.<p>So maybe they&#x27;re actually doing this for themselves? To say, &quot;See? Maybe I am not as smart or creative or talented in a way that directly benefits our business, but I work as hard as everyone else put together because I care more.&quot;<p>But all the same I should start trying to wake up early to exercise.

708315,comment,707014,708168,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Oh, I'm definitely not saying that it <i>replaces</i> automated testing. A mixed approach is almost certainly best. I like randomized testing, too. Just, (conservatively) half of the things people write as unit tests could be expressed in the type system in OCaml* . If not correct for all possible input, they prevent the program from compiling, and lead you to everywhere the property doesn't hold. That's arguably a stronger guarantee than passing tests for known input->output at runtime. (In all fairness, much of it can also be done with Java or C++'s type systems, but without type inference it becomes incredibly tedious, and ML type constructors are far more direct than wrapping things in classes all over the place.)<p>Type systems are <i>also</i> ""just another tool"", though, and more useful in some cases than others. I wonder how many other properties about a program could be declared, inferred, and verified for the complete domain of input at compile time -- this is safe to use concurrently, that is fully isolated from non-deterministic input, this can have its results memoized, those can fully evaluated once at compile time and don't even need to run in final executable, etc. (Haskell can do some of this, but I don't like lazy evaluation as a default, among other things.) Playing with Prolog and logic programming has gotten me curious about how far that sort of analysis could be pushed.<p>About the insurance example -- I know exactly where you're coming from. I've done something similar for the architectural industry, and a huge suite of example results helped tremendously.<p>* And very likely Haskell, SML, Clean, and others, but my ""advanced type system"" experience is mostly with OCaml.",1247763490

It is a free linux program, it will integrate pictures from a variety of cameras and save them in a searchable way via a web interface.  You can make it trigger on motion, and only save those shots, and it will make little avi movies out of sequential stills from an ordinary still camera.<p>In my experimentation, I found that ethernet based ""web cams"" worked best for my application.    I used the cheap Airlink brand sold at Fry's.  The quality is not good, but good enough to see who is in a room.  If you need to read license plates in a parking lot they will not be good enough.<p>I believe a decent small business could be made simply building and installing zoneminder boxes.  I tried to get set up to do that but never really got that first customer.<p>Another business opportunity is in higher quality cameras for zoneminder and similar applications.  Security cameras are really 15 years behind in picture quality, and to get decent quality you pay thousands of dollars.  I tried to use one of the common consumer cameras, via the control-by-USB mode, as a security camera, but the control by USB mode is buggy and unreliable on most of those cameras.<p>If you made a simple ethernet camera like the Airlink 101 sold at Fry's, but had auto-focus, at least 3 megapixels, auto-correction for low light, I think they would sell well.",1247760091

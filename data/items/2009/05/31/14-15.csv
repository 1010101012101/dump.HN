Obviously Steve Ballmer would love for MS to knock off Google at the head of search, but it would be nice for their search offering to be profitable first, wouldn't it?

634708,comment,632518,634475,0,0,grandalf,,,"Good point...  From Wikipedia:<p>Doubt as a path towards (deeper) religious faith lies at the heart of the story of Saint Thomas the Apostle. Note in this respect the theological views of Georg Hermes:<p><i>... the starting-point and chief principle of every science, and hence of theology also, is not only methodical doubt, but positive doubt. One can believe only what one has perceived to be true from reasonable grounds, and consequently one must have the courage to continue doubting until one has found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason.[3]</i>",1243781178

Petty bickering is going to ultimately hurt everyone using python...<p>a) Either you won't get good quality code because Zed may be right.<p>or<p>b) You will get Zed's python branch because he/others got pissed off enough and the python community will be split into two.<p>I say B is a good solution. Eventually python-fusion will come out. :)<p>Edit: Let the war begin!",1243781126

634693,comment,634484,634484,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I worked for a public library for several years, and we spent quite a bit of time helping people suddenly required to use the internet for their basic economic/social arrangements.<p>While the article mentions using message boards, Flickr, etc., those are probably of secondary importance. Surprisingly many low-end jobs, particularly retail, only accept applications online. While this is probably a cost-cutting measure, it's also extremely effective de-facto discrimination against people without internet access at home. (Some of the applications seemed designed to make completing them in a public library's typical 30-60 minute limit difficult.) Similarly, many unemployment offices in Michigan have closed to cut costs, and AFAIK people can only file for unemployment online now. It's much easier to do taxes online, etc.<p>Many organizations, both public and private, have moved their primary resources online, since publishing and updating are significantly cheaper. The permeation of internet connectivity in the US hasn't quite caught up, though. Sweden, for example, decided to lay optical fiber while they were already digging to update other national utility infrastructures, and has much better connectivity as a result. In the US, we have more landmass and far more uneven population density. While there are some metropolitan wireless network initiatives, people in e.g. Nebraska are probably stuck with dialup or (if lucky) a telecom monopoly.",1243778801

What about the teachers?  Then naturally, someone from education administration since you want to be fair.  What about the most important industry of all, agriculture?  Your empire won't last very long without food!  Let's not forget the Doctors.  Again, to be fair, we will need to give a place at the table to insurers as well.  Ooops!  I forgot the handicapped.  Now to balance things out there we will need an Olympic medalist in track and field, or swimming.  Etc.  Etc.  Ad Infinitum.<p>I hope everyone can see where that line of thinking takes us.

Your solutions did not generate the correct output for the questions.<p>For example, I'll take the following question :<p>'Given the string variable 's' and the integer 'n', return a new string consisting of n repetitions of s.<p>For example, if s = ""abc"" and n = 3, you should return ""abcabcabc"".'<p>The code you have written is as follows :<p>String duplicate(String s, int n)\n{<p><pre><code>  String result = s;\n  // First assignment already done\n\n  while (n > 0) {\n     result += s;\n     n--;\n  }\n\n  return result;</code></pre>\n}<p>If we analyze the following code (assuming that s = ""abc"" and n = 3), initially, the variable 'result' is assigned the value ""abc"".<p>The loop then runs 3 times - when n = 3, when n = 2 and when n = 1. Which effectively means that ""abc"" is concatenated 3 more times giving the string ""abcabcabcabc"", which is incorrect.<p>I do agree that the solution is <i>almost</i> right. Note that you are allowed to compile your code and run it against our testdata (and even your own test cases) in order to establish it's correctness - which means that you did have the opportunity to find out that there was a bug in your code and fix it.<p>But in computing, how often is it acceptable to get things 'almost' right ? Would you be happy if Google returned search results which were almost right ?<p>I know that if a human conducted the interview, he would have helped guide you through the test - in fact, we are almost done adding the capability for recruiters to monitor test sessions in real time and converse with candidates.<p>I can also provide a case by case analysis of your other solutions if you wish.",1277534782

Few libertarians are anarcho-capitalists; they want a state and thus have to accept <i>some</i> taxes. They just want them to be very low and, usually, to be able to enjoy other things that are perfectly reasonable to want to enjoy (pot/cheap foreign labour/excellent foreign labour/raw milk cheeses FDA does not permit/exotic medical treatments). Imagine a thousand square kilometres of California with a laissez faire system akin to that of Dubai. Hackers who want more money (or access to foreign talent, cheap foreign labour etc.) would move there. They would make it apparent that most of the taxes they used to pay, while perhaps used for good in a general utilitarian sense (a point I only concede for the sake of brevity), was not used for <i>their</i> good.

If inheritance tax is a double-tax then by the same standards all taxes are like an infinity-tax.<p>One way of looking at it is like this:<p>Government siphons off taxes at multiple points within the lifecycle of any given unit of money (a dollar, a penny, whatever). Businesses also siphon off money in the form of profits (ideally) and costs (unavoidably, unless outright theft was used to procure input resources, etc.). Basically, money gets fractionally siphoned off and redirected into other streams. If the money is siphoned off by a business under the label of profit, the Republican Party (a US thing) treats it as a good thing. Instead, if the money is siphoned off by a government under the label of taxes, Repubs tend to call it a bad thing.

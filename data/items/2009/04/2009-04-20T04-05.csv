570233,story,,,59,19,ffernan,"The Great Brazilian Sat-Hack Crackdown",http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2009/04/fleetcom,"CAMPINAS, Brazil â€” On the night of March 8, cruising 22,000 miles above the Earth, U.S. Navy communications satellite FLTSAT-8 suddenly erupted with illicit activity. Jubilant voices and anthems crowded the channel on a junkyard's worth of homemade gear from across vast and silent stretches of the Amazon: Ronaldo, a Brazilian soccer idol, had just scored his first goal with the Corinthians.<p>It was a party that won't soon be forgotten. Ten days later, Brazilian Federal Police swooped in on 39 suspects in six states in the largest crackdown to date on a growing problem here: illegal hijacking of U.S. military satellite transponders.<p>""This had been happening for more than five years,"" says Celso Campos, of the Brazilian Federal Police. ""Since the communication channel was open, not encrypted, lots of people used it to talk to each other.""<p>The practice is so entrenched, and the knowledge and tools so widely available, few believe the campaign to stamp it out will be quick or easy.<p>Much of this country's population lives in remote areas beyond the reach of cellphone coverage, making American satellites an ideal, if illegal, communications option. The problem goes back more than a decade, to the mid-1990s, when Brazilian radio technicians discovered they could jump on the UHF frequencies dedicated to satellites in the Navy's Fleet Satellite Communication system, or FLTSATCOM. They've been at it ever since.<p>Truck drivers love the birds because they provide better range and sound than ham radios. Rogue loggers in the Amazon use the satellites to transmit coded warnings when authorities threaten to close in. Drug dealers and organized criminal factions use them to coordinate operations.<p>Today, the satellites, which pirates called ""Bolinha"" or ""little ball,"" are a national phenomenon.<p>""It's impossible not to find equipment like this when we catch an organized crime gang,"" says a police officer involved in last month's action.<p>The crackdown, called ""Operation Satellite,"" was Brazil's first large-scale enforcement against the problem. Police followed coordinates provided by the U.S. Department of Defense and confirmed by Anatel, Brazil's FCC. Among those charged were university professors, electricians, truckers and farmers, the police say. The suspects face up to four years and jail, but are more likely to be fined if convicted.",1240203477

570229,comment,569940,570101,0,0,gmazzola,,,"Sadly, this is outside my area of expertise. I will nonetheless attempt to answer your question, but please take my words with a grain of salt.<p>Before we even begin delving into true RNGs, it is worthwhile to consider if we're over-engineering the problem. Is a PRNG ""good enough"" for the task at hand? In most cases, it is. A well-seeded PRNG, such as the ones present in modern-day Operating Systems, are suitable for most tasks not involving National Security.<p>However, if you have a genuine need for a true RNG, a computer algorithm certainly won't be generating it. Computers are by nature deterministic, and thus are very poor at behaving unpredictably. Thus, like with all good problems, we are forced to enter the realm of physics.<p>The fundamental problem is, who will be observing the source of randomness? To my knowledge, there isn't a physical source of randomness that is observable to everybody. (I did some quick googling to confirm my suspicions, but if you're planning on using my words to do anything useful, <i>please</i> confirm my statement!). Thus, as I see it, you have several options:<p>1) Your idea, where all parties derive a true random number from physics and publically sum everyone's numbers together. Your qualifiers (2) through (4) hold, but (1) is difficult. In this case, a certain number of rogue nodes will be able to manipulate the computation. I remember a Professor of mine, who does research in this field, stating the minimum number of truthful nodes needed in a distributed computation is (2/3)n + 1, but again confirm this number for yourself.<p>My point here is, using the public-summing method, you are faced with the difficult problem of determining if a node is attempting to manipulate the system. While a provable solution has been found, after decades of research across the globe, my Professor still is working on the problem, thus demonstrating it is not an easy task.<p>2) Have a single computer (say, random.org) that is observing a true RNG, and publicizes the result for all to see. Of course you'd use asymmetric crypto so that all parties can prove that they've received the correct number.<p>Again, your qualifiers (2) through (4) pass, but (1) presents a different problem. We're back to where we started: do you trust random.org?<p>However, it's an easier task to make an authority trustable than a peer in a distributed computation. We trust Verisign to be a certificate authority, because we believe their security practices are half-decent, and they can be audited. (Every year all CA's are independently audited by WebTrust.org using pretty strict criteria.)<p>The same could be done for random.org: why not require certification and frequent auditing of their RNG equipment?<p>The other nice thing about RNGs is that you can audit them yourself, given enough time and expertise. When viewed correctly, poor RNGs will have distinct patterns visible to the eye (example: <a href=""http://www.cs.hku.hk/cisc/projects/va/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.hku.hk/cisc/projects/va/index.htm</a> ).<p>The crux of my argument is: I don't know of a true RNG, that upon observation by multiple parties, all will receive the same random number. My instinct and my research says that none exist, but I would love to be proven wrong. Crypto experts, correct me!<p>If you'd like more information, Wikipedia is always invaluable: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generato...</a>",1240203252

Whereas weights are designed to exercise specific muscle [groups], I think that activities like sit-ups and push-ups work muscles in such a way as to deliver more real-life benefit. They certainly expose you to less risk than weight-training and can deliver a full workout without much planning, a requirement when using weights.<p>In my opinion, most people lifting weights do so for superficial reasons, (not that there's anything wrong with that).

You will probably want to have a general idea of what region of the valley you want to be located in; if you are just coming out to be a founder of a ramen-startup then you have a lot of flexibility, but you might also want to consider the fact that you might eventually need/want to get a ""day job"" or have others join your effort (which means that you might want to consider various commuting distances for places you are considering.)<p>If you have no other plan beyond ""go out to silicon valley and change the world"" then I would probably suggest that you stay out of San Francisco (too many fun social distractions) and aim for that suburban strip from San Mateo to Sunnyvale.  This area is generally close enough to CalTrain that you can get in and out of SF with just a bike and you are more likely to replace social evenings at a club in SF with an entrepreneur meet-up in Palo Alto.  Eventually you will need/want a car for general transit, but this particular zone will make it possible for you to get by without one for a while if necessary.  After a year of this you will know the area a lot better, have a better idea where you want to live next, and will hopefully have made a bit of progress on your startup.<p>Start looking for a place on craigslist.

570202,comment,569940,570130,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think it's a lot more complicated than the diminishing-marginal-returns model taught in econ courses.  For example, there's a pretty sharp discontinuity at ""can move to a better neighborhood"".  There's another one at ""can afford a vacation home"", and another one at ""can send kids to college"".  And then there's a big one at ""never has to work again.""  When an event bumps you from one category into the next one up, it can often be rational to take a small chance at that rather unlikely event than to worry about a few dollars that don't make a material difference in your lifestyle anyway.<p>Actually, this is a big problem with conventional economics: it assumes that all variables are conventional.  So income taxes don't affect people's willingness to work nearly as much as theory predicts, because their choice is usually between ""Have a job"" and ""Don't have a job"" and not ""Do $30K of work per year"" and ""Do $40k of work per year"".  Unemployment exists because a business can't just drop wages to the equilibrium level, but rather workers make the choice between ""I'm being paid fairly"" and ""I'm not being paid fairly"" and act appropriately.  Market niches are not instantly filled because entrepreneurship often has a binary outcome of ""Get rich"" and ""Fail"", and not a continuous distribution of outcomes.",1240201433

Do everything with barbells to start if possible, if not go with dumbbells.<p>I do agree 5x5 or so is the way to go - especially starting out as this will allow you to go with heavier weights.<p>Don't go to failure, keep well below that and stay consistent a few times a week.  It is by far the best way to gain overall strength.  Lookup 'riptoes workout' as a good guide to that basic plan if you want the generally accepted best way to gain strength from scratch.",1240200053

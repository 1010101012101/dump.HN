They don't have top of the line equipment, their professors aren't always the best; it's their student bodies that make them more than anything else.  When you get the very best (in their areas) out of 1 billion people....<p>As for MIT numbers, you might find these interesting/useful: current yearly applications are something like 13,000, a bit more than 3,000 are judged as being able to do the work (that's the number one thing that's important to MIT; while mistakes are inevitable, it accepts <i>no one</i> who they don't fully believe can make it).<p>10% of those are ""obvious admits"" and the admissions staff, augmented by anyone on the staff with a clue who volunteers (especially to make absolutely sure <i>every</i> application gets at least two readings) then agonize over who amongst the rest to offer a slot to.  (It's hard and not really fun; I have a very good friend who does this on a time available basis and I helped her a bit one year when I was on the staff.)<p>MIT shoots for a yield of around 1080 the last time I checked (that figure is old, but is tightly constrained by available student housing, all freshman must spend their first year in it; one year the the admissions office made a big enough mistake they had to turn a graduate dorm's basement into makeshift housing, which perhaps not surprisingly worked out very well (they bonded into a tight and self-supporting group)).<p>The self-selection in applications is <i>tremendous</i>.  Nobody attends MIT who doesn't think they wanted to (that can of course change once they arrive ^_^, but I didn't see much of that in the '80s).<p>Thanks for the intelligent discussion and observations.",1270039543

That's part of the revolution Jobs is talking about with the iPad, but you've got to get one of the 3G models to experience it.<p>Regarding storage, like I said I really don't know how much I need. I know how much space a movie could take up, which is probably the biggest single thing I would store, but I'm likely to want a few of them.

MassiveDebate.com could be a suitable domain for someone tackling the problem.<p>As a reader, one problem is in getting an overall feel for the 'lean' of the conversation. There must be a way to incorporate this in large discussions, or to categorise posts by theme ('Thinks murder sentence given was too short', 'Thinks sentence given too long', 'Discussing increased police attention for bikie gangs', etc).<p>Or identify key contributors by post volume or karma within a thread.<p>Or provide ways for a reader to seek out arguments with people they disagree with, or to mostly see like-minded commentors (confirmation bias).<p>Another problem for readers is knowing where to start. Oldest topics first or newest? Randomised order? I've wondered (half-baked idea) about topics along a horizontal axis with responses hanging down the vertical axis from each parent topic. Might be something in that, or could just be a usability disaster. Or maybe the viewport is fixed (no horiz scrollbar) but you hit arrows to each side to browse top-level topics? Each sub-topic could have a header that included info about the originator, key contributors within, general lean of the contents ('Strongly favours those that think the sentence was too light.').<p>Another issue is in finding the most worthwhile comments (Slashdot has moderation and so on that can be helpful but I've only ever used it as a set-and-forget thing to browse at +2 with Funny discounted heavily). The biggest news network in Australia doesn't even have this (or threading, or anything useful) in its commenting system. It's flat, no notifications, no ownership of an alias, no prevention of people impersonating others, no up/down vote - and it's been like that for years!<p>As a contributor, a big problem is the perception and reality that a lot of comments are drive-bys. Forcing, encouraging or using a default setting of email notification could help there, but in a way that doesn't leave you diving for the off-switch once the replies start getting heavy. I think the PHP BB (or maybe it's a competing forum I'm thinking of) system of sending one alert only until you return to view the thread has merit. Providing quality tools/experience for regular contributors could encourage people to hang around and build up their karma within the system, etc.<p>How do you tackle a 500+-post conversation?

We do ""well"" by our definition, terrible by the writer's.<p>So, problem #1: using hand-drawn faces (these are fairly stylized) is a really bad way to test a face detector. No one ""in the real world"" wants to detect or recognize hand-drawn faces, and so no one trains with hand-drawn faces. We, specifically, err on the side of choosing to exclude stylized faces from the faces category (though most frequently these would be ""don't-cares"").<p>Problem #2: Using a single image is actually a bit misleading, because if you really want to ""test"" methods for thwarting detection, you need to use a video. Those slight variations in pose and lighting are going to make it much easier to pick up the face and filter out the misses.<p>Lastly, if you wanted to ""defeat"" a dystopian mass surveillance system, you don't want to prevent detection, but recognition. It's far easier. And to prevent good recognition over a huge dataset (ie, the population of the world), you just need to ""remove"" information from your face. Wear big ol' sunglasses and a hat. Far more effective, far less conspicuous.<p>(edit to add: if you click 'thesis' at the top, and read the top few entries, he shows alot more about how viola-jones and the haar wavelets are used to find face regions.

Today one of her clients, an American bank, has asked her to find new customers. At first she guides the algorithm to buy as many impressions as possible near bank branches. Then she narrows her targets, choosing criteria that produce a better hit rate. For example, she finds that tablet users sign up more often than iPhone users, and afternoon seems to be a better time than morning.<p>It sounds so hand-wavy. I&#x27;m guessing she (as well as the entire food chain from her keyboard onwards - the DSPs to the SSPs and the publisher websites) would be sleeping under a bridge if she was paid for actual conversions, rather than for just filling a purchase order of impressions with whatever she can get.<p>Sometimes I wish I could get clients with loose wallets like this...<p>...and what on earth does getting impressions &quot;near bank branches&quot; mean?",1410465534

They&#x27;re unlikely to mingle and thus form reform movements either. Politicians like it this way and even the few that may not take advantage of these racial divisions to push policies that hurt the poor in general and the non-white in particular.

This means that allocations that are needed to do pageout and other things to free memory can deadlock. There is a workaround in the SPL that will switch it to kmalloc when this issue occurs. There is also a new mechanism in Linux 3.9 and later that should render this unnecessary.<p>2. The kernel deals with kernel virtual address space exhaustion in vmalloc() by spinning until memory becomes available. This is not a problem on current 64-bit systems where the virtual address space used by vmalloc is larger than physical memory, but it is a problem on most 32-bit systems.",1410464962

If you are just doing a startup for the end result then you&#x27;re probably in it for the wrong reasons. You&#x27;re probably going to fail, so hopefully the journey is somewhat rewarding.<p>Most of the comments here are pretty harsh, but I think the author has some really good points. Maybe not everyone is impressed by his former management consulting job, but even if you aren&#x27;t, quitting your job (or forgoing a regular salary) to do a startup is probably not going to be supported in everyone in your life. My personal experience has been that most people have been supportive, but I live in the Bay area. My parents try to be supportive, but I think they think I&#x27;m crazy/foolish and keep it to themselves. Social pressures can be a big hardship, having support from friends and family can make things a lot easier.<p>As far as money goes, he is totally right. Having savings to live off of for a year+ is a wise plan. (But so is living frugally from the first day you quit your job, and perhaps bringing a refillable water bottle).",1410464160

It&#x27;s similar to OO you&#x27;re used to in Java etc, but the types are often inferred instead of requiring that you state up front that classes/objects are subtypes of other classes.<p>It allows you to use objects just as you would records, except:<p>1. You don&#x27;t have to predefine the object types anywhere - with records you do.\n2. With OCaml &quot;objects&quot;, you get inferred &quot;row polymorphism&quot;, which means that you can make a function (without any type annotations) that accepts a point, and accesses point.x, and point.y. This function will also, gladly accept a 3D point that has an extra field point.z, that the function never accesses. In OCaml, you never even needed to predefine a type for 2DPoint or 3DPoint. This is similar to, but different than the OO &quot;subtyping&quot; that you&#x27;re used to in OO languages.\n3. Records don&#x27;t provide this &quot;row polymorphism&quot; that OCaml objects provide.\n4. Records do allow pattern matching.\n5. I would like to see the best of both. Pattern matching and row polymorphism into one new record abstraction.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are tradeoffs (likely something to do with predictable memory layout accommodating efficient instructions). Row polymorphism may make type inference times longer, or error messages less readable. I&#x27;m definitely not the right person to give an overview of this - so please do your own investigation on the tradeoffs. I&#x27;d love to hear an expert chime in.<p>But all in all, I&#x27;m happy with records and the performance I see. Named arguments (with optional defaults) (which OCaml has) can fulfill the role of a unified record/object system, in some cases.",1410464123

You also have 10 coins, and if the coin comes up heads, it costs $1,000. Insurance is when you charge the dice $166 and the coins $500.

If you can&#x27;t do simple two digit addition in your head by the time you start learning things that involve larger processes like inequalities and quadratic equations you WILL slow down and possibly become frustrated and lose confidence. If you want to get by in these subjects you have to start to depend on the calculator.<p>But guess what? Now you want to be a computer science major and all of the sudden you have to learn how to graph trig functions and find the instantaneous rate under a curve. Calculators can&#x27;t help you now.

8304510,comment,8304019,8304019,1,0,zackmorris,,,"Had a similar case with someone in Nicaragua.  The procedure (including diagnosis, medication etc) was $3,000 there whereas it would have been at least $30,000 in the US.  I think it goes well beyond cost of living comparisons, because most things there cost perhaps 2-4 times less than here.  Even if we factor in that per-capita medical costs in the US are roughly double the rest of the developed world ($6,000 vs $3,000) there is still another multiplier of perhaps 2-3x for procedures.<p>I’m becoming more convinced every day that the US has become a two-tier society.  I (and many of my friends) have had some very lean years, earning perhaps $7-15,000 and surviving.  During those times, saving even $3,000 was next to impossible, because we were already $5, $10, $20,000 in debt or more.  Multiply that by 10 and it’s effectively out of reach for, I don’t know, 90% of the country.  The standard deductible (which is looking like it’s going to be about $6,000 under Obamacare) will often mean the loss of a home, vehicle, or college savings, especially for chronic conditions.<p>Meanwhile the people who determine these rates (doctors, hospitals, medical supply companies, insurance agencies) enjoy comfortable incomes of $50, $100, $250,000 or more.  I don’t think they are capable of setting rates ethically.  Throw in the fact that aging people are desperate and will basically pay anything to live longer, and it’s an unavoidable conflict of interest.<p>I think the simplest solution to all of this (and probably the most controversial) is to decouple medical research from practice.  Ban all medicine-related patents.  Create low interest government matching funds for the loans provided by supply companies to dentists and other independent practitioners.  Remove the regulations that prop up monopolists and rent seekers.  Start reducing the administrative layer that adds so much cost but so little quality of care.  Then protect doctors from frivolous lawsuits with a bond system like plumbers and electricians use for catastrophic accidents so they can perform the procedures they feel are needed instead of the ones deemed “safest” or most profitable.  Go after the true medical costs, the Erin Brockovich type of coverups that cost the economy billions.  And especially go after the sources of illness - radiation from burning coal, carcinogens released by fracking, a hamstrung FDA that doesn’t have the resources to test interactions between thousands of household chemicals, carcinogenic herbicides and pesticides used on genetically modified food, and so on.<p>I’ve heard the standard arguments about how all of this might disincentivize medical research but I don’t buy them.  The system we have now rewards treatments more than cures, as evidenced by big pharma ads on TV for irritable-whatever.  If we really want to start over, we need to go back to pre-Nixon, before HMOs and profit-driven care.  We need to spend substantially more on medical research than we do now (rather than practice), through universities and big-data approaches where biologists and chemists can run simulations and avoid human trials.  Dump the current grant system and make funding far more accessible so researching don’t spend all of their time fundraising.<p>If we do all of this, we may just have a shot at cracking the underlying mechanisms that cause illness, basically map every virus and bacteria, the mechanisms through which genes control proteins, how we age and repair damage, etc etc.  We should be growing replacement organs by now.  We should have cured chronic conditions like diabetes and arthritis years ago and gotten cures for allergies, asthma and autism for free since similar pathways are at work.  Right now we are doing little to no prevention, charging just enough to keep people from going to the doctor at early stages of illness, and then charging an arm and a leg for the medical equivalent of disaster cleanup.  It’s really quite remarkable, and sad.",1410462484

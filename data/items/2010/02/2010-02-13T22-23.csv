Of course, things are rarely equal, and I agree with maxharris that the impossibility of correcting errors means that capital punishment should be off limits for justice systems.<p>More to your point, though, I think that a justice system which was ultimately based on retribution would have all the positive qualities you speak of as valid motivations.  Fitting the punishment to the crime is very difficult unless you have a way to measure how bad the crime was.  An eye for an eye, as a default outcome, would provide a quantitative starting point for negotiations between (living) victims and the original aggressor.

I'm not a Flash expert, but as far as I know it can only open <i>TCP</i> connections, and only to specially set up servers (which respond positively to a policy request on a certain port). Punching holes in firewalls is pretty much a UDP-only thing in practice; Skype is one of the few apps that truly pull it off, and even that's not 100% reliable.<p>You could in theory do it with a signed Java applet, though it will ask the user for permission for access to his entire computer, and it's not something you'd throw together in a few weeks.",1266099348

But I wouldn't be very mad at god because of that. I also wouldn't respect him very much. I'm pretty blind to the suffering of animals or sometimes even other humans (I was much more shocked when I heard about the death of my grandpa than when I heard about the earthquake in Haiti).

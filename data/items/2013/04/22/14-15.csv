5589520,comment,5589432,5589432,8,0,antonID,,,"The problem is that this is discriminatory. If you are not hiring based solely on qualifications, and instead on gender, it is discriminating. If you were to switch the genders and say that you are only hiring men, it would be clearly sexist. However, if you do not accept well qualified men who would fit the job, it is seen as ""breaking gender barriers"". You should be hiring based on the applicant's experience, education, and how they fit in with company culture.<p>If you are worried about a gender gap, you should be looking at why fewer females apply. Once you remedy this, you will be able to consider an equal amount of applicants, and you should then choose them based on their experience instead of their gender. The title of this article makes it out as if people are trying to stop you from hiring women, when in fact, you are instead trying to justify discrimination.",1366642720

I disagree strongly that APIs should be vague about what they provide.<p>An API designer who deliberately leaves out documentation of important features (like pagination, sorting, etc), and fails to specify the format of what comes back any further than ""this will be what you intended"", hasn't designed an API at all.<p>APIs are well-defined interfaces that other programmers can rely on.  If there is no well-specified contract, there is no API.<p>Defining such an interface so that it's reasonably future-proof? Yup, that's hard. And you're not an API designer until you take on that challenge.  If you instead punt on all that responsibility, and provide the user few or no guarantees about how your service works, you've taken the cowardly way out.<p>The essence of software architecture is isolating and tackling complexity.  Isolate it in the API, don't push it out to every one of your users.<p>I don't argue that an API needs to specify <i>absolutely everything</i> about its operation, but obscuring and removing features from an API without changing the version number is foul play.  That is fragility.",1366642606

It's actually more of a ""at the latest"" figure, not a lower bound.<p>There is no even a compelling theory going either way as to whether these signals are random (I assume that's what you mean by ""spontaneous depolarisations of action potential"", otherwise it'd make no sense : that happens in fetuses, you and me, and granddads. For that matter, it happens in corpses weeks after death. They are neither an indication of consciousness, nor an indicator of it's absence).<p>Given how neural cells work, and that there are actual living animals that have shapes very similar to fetuses in this stage of development whose movements are definitely not random, my guess would be that these signals are anything but random. I would even say that it's extremely likely that these neurons are capable of sensing their environment in some way and attempting to come to grips with it, because in the animals they are.<p>Here's a picture of the human embryo at 18(-21) days after conception : \n<a href=""http://mybrainnotes.com/human-embryo-brain.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mybrainnotes.com/human-embryo-brain.jpg</a>\nIs it really so hard to believe that an animal that complex has functioning senses and a working brain, and is contemplating, maybe not it's existence, but definitely it's environment ?",1366641072

For every 1000 or so servers (or CGNs) an ISP adds to a network, 1000 home users must be NATted.  I think you can rule out vhosts and the like for NAT traversal use, so that means you need to supply a VPS or dedicated server for this and pay extra for the bandwidth/IP address.  Alternatively, you can use 6to4/Teredo/native IPv6 right now as your ""overlay network"" to address clients directly and avoid all that at the expense of using up CGN mappings.

Just more than eleven years ago, an April with a late arrival of spring like this year meant that we had a winter storm in early April. My dad was out on a shopping errand in the morning, and slipped and fell on an icy store parking lot while walking back to his car. He was just days before his seventy-second birthday then, and the slip and fall left him paralyzed from the neck down, as he injured a cervical vertebra in the fall.<p>He originally thought he would fully recover from that injury. He had fully recovered from a similar injury (from a car crash while his mother was driving him to college) when he was still a teenager, back well before I was born. He had surgery after his later injury, but the surgery only made his condition worse--not only could he not move any of his limbs, but he also couldn't clear his throat or swallow, and he could speak only with difficulty. He spent the last six years of his life that disabled, sometimes making a bit of progress in recovering motion through physical therapy, but never making enough progress to regain the ability to walk or to eat without a gastric tube.<p>So, yeah, end of life care issues are tough. My dad thought beforehand that he had written down careful instructions in a personal care directive prepared years before his injury. But even though that document listed many different possible conditions, with directives for his care in each case, what actually happened to him was an edge case compared to everything on the list. It absorbed a lot of my time and attention while my children were young and I had just moved back to the United States from overseas to check how my dad was doing and keep him company when his other family caregivers were exhausted. For six years, our weekends were visits to grandpa--never much of anything else.<p>In the end, his transition from eventual intensive care as health issues piled up from his long-term immobility turned into a very brief stay in hospice before my dad died. (My dad died at a considerably younger age than his father before him.) I'm sure he didn't want to die that way. He wanted to walk again before he died, but that was never possible. Slow decline in health is hard to face and hard to make satisfying decisions about.",1366639666

4479312,comment,4478627,4478627,6,0,ejames,,,"Hmm.  I appreciate the idea of a standardized way to modify a JSON document, but I'm not certain what problem it realistically solves.  Can someone who's worked with APIs that accept updates give a code example of something that would be better if you accepted patches instead?<p>Other commenters have brought up size - that the patch must be quite a bit smaller than the whole document in order to gain a benefit - but I'm not sure it's useful even then.  JSON is typically the representation of an object <i>for transmission over the wire</i>, not its final representation on the server.<p>I have a Rails servers with a JSON API, but it stores information in a SQL database where the columns roughly correspond to the JSON keys.  I'm not actually storing JSON in the database and the mapping of JSON key to database column is not always one-to-one.  That means if I want to accept a patch for an object with JSON Patch, I need some way of applying the patch ""upstream"" to the SQL row that is the source of truth for the object.  And, of course, for a database with a schema, only a strictly limited subset of potential JSON Patch objects submitted can actually be applied.<p>The architectural benefit of accepting JSON Patch as an update is that ""it's just JSON"", but in order to apply a patch on pure JSON, you must have pure JSON and store pure JSON.  It's now common for servers to use JSON but that doesn't mean it's ""JSON all the way down"".  In the case of my Rails project, I would need to generate the JSON for an object (or retrieve it from the cache), apply the patch to that JSON, then treat the result as if it had been submitted as an entire document to the update endpoint.  Instead of parsing received JSON, I need to generate JSON, process a patch, then parse the result.  Whether or not the client has to deal with the entire JSON document, the server has to do so.<p>Now moving the burden to the server can actually be a very important improvement if that's where you want to do the work, but I don't know that you need a new standard of JSON document to do that - if you want to perform small updates on large objects, you can write the server such that clients are allowed to omit key-value pairs that are not to be changed when sending JSON to update existing items.  Perhaps I'm just dense, but it seems like you only need to iterate through the keys that are included and update only those fields.<p>JSON Patch is a defined format for doing that but it adds a layer of abstraction to the operations, when you actually would want clients to be concrete in specifying keys and values so the server doesn't have to perform lookup to figure out which value is under which path.<p>Likewise for the concept of ""synchronizing"" structures, the problem is that you cannot apply a patch correctly unless you start with the same JSON before applying the patch.  I don't know if the speed gain from sending patches instead of entire documents justifies the extra reliability work you need to do to make sure the synchronization eventually succeeds.  Plus, just as you don't save time in the code to apply a received patch unless a JSON document is the canonical ""source of truth"" for that object, it takes work to generate a patch for another party to apply unless a JSON document is the ""source of truth"" and you can cheaply produce the diff in terms of JSON.  (Like any document format, you CAN process and produce the data eventually, but the question is whether it's easier than alternatives.)<p>It seems like this could be useful for a system where you specifically want to store the changes to an item - i.e. an audit log - but I don't know if JSON Patch is substantially better than existing ways of doing that.  Before reading this paper, if I was asked to write a project that stores the changes to a chunk of JSON, I might have done something like insert a \n character after each key-value pair and store the history as commits in git.  That's a hack, but since JSON is text and developers already have lots of ways to manipulate text, I'm not sure why it's necessarily better to work with the state changes as ""JSON that is changed by events that are also JSON"" rather than ""text that is changed by events, and the result always parses as JSON"", since there are already good tools for working with plain text and evaluating changes to the text.<p>I can see this being useful in a system where you have really set a deep architectural assumption that it's ""JSON all the way down"", and therefore a JSON Patch can be treated with some level of abstraction rather than just being a well-defined shorthand for sending fewer bytes over the wire.  If the system is a document store that considers arbitrary JSON to be the unit of storage, then you don't need to worry about mapping into alternative storage formats.  However, that seems like a very specific subset of the architectures in the world of ""servers that communicate with JSON"".",1346852913

Your website title is ""GrowGuard - Welcome"" perhaps change this to something more descriptive so that I and google will know that it's about being able to monitor your plants online as well as watering them the right amount.<p>2. The front page says ""GrowGuard"" as the h1.  Perhaps add a tag line underneath that clearly explains the main and perhaps secondary benefits? Maybe something like ""water your plant correctly"" or ""the easiest way to water your plant"" or ""the best way to correctly water your plant""<p>3. The buttons near the top ""home, GrowGuard, etc"" get a bit lost with the white space above them.<p>4. The home button doesn't take you home, it actually takes you to the medium kit.<p>5. The GrowGuard button takes you to the about page, but it's not clear that it will actually do that.  perhaps have it say ""about us""<p>6. The money back guarantee is a 3 month / 90 day guarantee.  Perhaps just make it 90 days?  A large percentage of the time 3 months is roughly 90 days and it lets you get rid of text on the page.<p>7. On the guarantee page, you say ""So, what are you waiting for? Order GrowGuard today!"" perhaps link the ""Order GrowGuard today"" to your order form so that people can click to it.<p>8. In the 3 benefits part of the page you have ""GrowGuard: Keeps your plants from dying"" twice with the same text beneath.  Perhaps split the ""GrowGuard: Keeps your plants from dying"" into two separate benefits?  This way you have less text on the page and you can show better benefits.<p>9. In your about us page, you mention pachube.com.  When I tried to go to the website it is now <a href=""https://cosm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cosm.com/</a>.  Perhaps it's worth rewriting this as well as putting in a link so that I can click on it directly.<p>10. I see that the plug looks European.

Somebody who was ""never especially good"" at programming but spent a lot of time try to be could make the exact same post.  Poker is very difficult to become successful at in your part-time, because you need to balance playing with studying which forces you to divide a small pie even smaller.<p>While the best of the best can beat tough tables and will play anybody, most of us make money by playing worse players.  Recreational players will often say ""I cant beat these players because they dont think, if only I could move up to where they respected my raises!"" But the problem with that is that the majority of our profits come from those players, if you cant figure them out, then you wont be beating the better players.  Plain and simple.<p>As far as math being overrated, I couldnt disagree more.  Yes, bad players or people who dont play often ask if you need to be a math genius to figure it out, or if you have to count cards, both of which arent true but that doesnt mean math is unimportant.  Yes, pot odds, counting outs, etc is all pretty basic.  Solving complex game trees for various situations to find the maximally exploitive play is not.  Is the math complex? No, not really.  It can be confusing, but there are tools to help and it isnt very high level math; however, that doesnt make it unimportant.<p>Further, saying math is unimportant is completely ignoring the activity you are ""playing.""  Poker is entirely math.  All you are doing is playing a numbers game.  In texas hold'em your first card dealt will have a 1/52 chance of being a specific card, and your second will have a 1/51 chance.  Then you have the various probabilities for the flop, turn, river, etc.  Saying poker isnt about math misses the forest for the trees.  I could say blackjack isnt about math, you just need to follow the basic counting strategies to turn a profit.  But what do you think those are based on? How were they calculated?  Look at what the University of Alberta is doing with math and try to say it isnt important.<p>I respect your posts in BFI at 2p2, but this is something that only provides the perspective of a player who never reached a high level of play.  It is important to understand that perspective, but while people should always learn from somebody who failed, they need to be very careful when looking to them for advice.  Yes, many give great advice, and many winners just got lucky, but you need to hear both sides.<p>TLDR: As far as the actual question goes, if you live in the US dont get into online poker unless it is just for fun.  There arent enough options for you to play, and the risks are too high.  If you are outside the US and want to learn the game, make sure you have enough time to study and play, use good resources (twoplustwo.com in conjunction with a video training site), listen to people better than you, and always try to improve.  Dont look for how to play x hand in y situation, look to understand the framework that will help you make those decisions.  It isnt easy, and if you already code then your time is better spent freelancing, but for college students, I think it is a great option, provided they can be honest with themselves about their abilities.<p>When it comes to crossover with programming, Im not so sure i directly agree (although Im just learning to code, so take this with a grain of salt) with their specific points.  I think when poker is properly studied, it helps you learn how to think and analyze situations rationally.  That ability helps the coding process, but it is broader than that, and not really the reasons the author outlined. It truly is a math/logic based game (so is any non purely luck based game), so it requires a similar mindset, but I dont expect learning one would help a ton with the other directly.",1346852339

Are you saying that only households making over $340k a year[1] would spend that much on a suit? My first job out of college was for $28k a year in a city. I had to spend much of that first year buying $600-800 suits because that's what I was expected to wear. I have friends that make what I make now and gladly drop twice what I would on a suit. It doesn't have anything to do with income.<p>I believe this was mentioned elsewhere, but a $4,000 suit isn't mainly about income or wealth, it's about taste. Pick up any $4,000 suit from a custom clothier and hang it up next to a $350 suit from Men's Wearhouse.

When Bell Labs eventually gave up on Research Unix and started from scratch they deliberately broke with almost every standard and convention in existence.<p>The programming language (Plan 9 has its own C dialect), breaking with POSIX, abolishing the process/thread dualism and doing away with the root user just to name a few.<p>By getting rid of all these inherited liabilities they were able to create a much slicker, much more uniform and most importantly truly network centric OS, which in many aspects (not necessarily in terms of performance) still surpasses modern unix-derived operating systems(you know...the usual suspects).
On the other hand the lack of backwards compatibility and the high barrier of entry prevented Plan 9&#x27;s widespread adoption outside the research community.<p>On the contrary if we need new functionality today the way to go seems to be piling new layers of abstraction on top of the already overly complex stuff we gatherd over the years until everything becomes an incomprehensible mess of special cases(16 million loc linux kernel, anyone?).
That of course is a good ol&#x27; tradition, which started when we first fumbled network support into the unix kernel and thereby broke the open-read-write-close interface convention.<p>To summerize:
Plan 9 is not Unix. Thankfully...",1418122797

8722108,comment,8718476,8721666,0,0,dschiptsov,,,"OK, lets make it long and explicit.<p>Asserting that an obscure, optional <i>either-of</i> type is some fundamental concept every single language has been overlooked is, of course, nonsense.<p>The fundamental concept is notion of &quot;nothingness&quot;, &quot;emptiness&quot;, what other languages call NIL. Without this a language would be very clumsy, like Math without zero.<p>The notion of empty vs. non-empty is captured in so-called &quot;either-of&quot; types. The most obvious example is &#x27;() - an empty list. Conceptually, it is a List, but it is also indicator of &quot;emptiness&quot;, of &quot;nothing inside&quot;.<p>A List is an &quot;either-of type&quot; itself, so it does not require any additional specialize type to capture the notion that it could be empty - it already has it.<p>Another example is so-called &quot;C-strings&quot;. There is notion of end-of-string marker, so a string could be viewed as a <i>list</i> instead of an <i>array</i> of characters. In this case (of a list) we don&#x27;t have define anything special for &quot;empty string&quot; - the notion of &quot;just end-of-string marker&quot; is good-enough.<p>Again. This Just/Nothing type in Haskell is nothing special or fundamental. It is an optional, non-essential construct.",1418122718

Objects would allow a bit more versatility than the &quot;everything is a file, usually one with plain UTF-8 text&quot; approach.
(And actually, Windows is closer to an object world with COM, as evidenced by e.g. the core model of PowerShell)<p>Of course, an object-model has a hard time when the rest of the world and the net is talking in files, you&#x27;re also much more likely to create a walled garden.<p>As for simplicity, I can understand that regarding systems like Smalltalk (or possibly lisp machines), although Oberon serves as a prime counter-example here. It did inspire the Acme editor, and here you can see that if your basic text model is objects, not just a byte-stream, some extensions are easier to do (different fonts, syntax highlighting, widgets).<p>And yes, I&#x27;m aware that the usual response to that was and is &quot;you don&#x27;t need that&quot;.

8722099,story,,,7,13,netcan,"Ask HN: What could we do today with a 1,000,000X increase in computing power?",,"I was recently discussing Ray Kurzweil with friends. Many of his arguments extend out Moore&#x27;s Law, speculating about what these future computers will power. I argued that Moore&#x27;s law alone doesn&#x27;t get us &quot;intelligence&quot; without the discovery of algorithms (or other mechanisms) that power intelligence in organisms. If we could mimic fungal intelligence with today&#x27;s resources, then we would just need more resources to make a super human (or super fungal) like brain. But since we can&#x27;t, Moore&#x27;s Law isn&#x27;t predictive of anything and all Ray&#x27;s timelines are bunk.<p>I think Kurzweil is working backwards. AI is coming. How do I predict it using current trends? I think we should go the other way: Here are the trends. What do they predict?<p>So here is the question: What <i>are</i> the things we could do with a 1,000,000X increase in computing power that don&#x27;t depend on unrelated future discoveries. What programs are just waiting for more power? Are our current evolutionary algorithms or some other AI approaches constrained in this way? Any less AI-ish programs constrained this way?

The can just barely make anything useful, good luck having it also be well designed and coded, secure, robust, fast, etc. Second, programming is like wizardry to most non-programmers, it&#x27;s hard enough for a professional software developer to judge another, it&#x27;s nigh impossible for J. Average Businessperson to do so, even if they have a dire need for software development. In the average case you might have some contract go out which ends up being won by some enterprisey line of business app development house who poops out some horrible cobbled together tool based on Excel, MS Access, and a winform app somewhere in there to glue things together, and then bills the customer for 6 or 7 figures (I&#x27;m not even joking).

Just look at the Obamacare website debacle as a case in point of how incredibly difficult it is to a: find a quality development shop who can actually deliver what you want, and b: do so within reasonable budget and time constraints. And the difference between finding a good development shop and a poor one isn&#x27;t merely a better quality product, it&#x27;s a factor of maybe 2x or more in development time (which is, of course, tremendously valuable) and a factor of 10-100x in cost.",1418121705

It&#x27;s kinda hard to explain concisely in more detail.<p>With a rigid inflated paraglider wing however, if the angle of attack becomes too low, the wing might get unloaded (falls faster than the pilot) and will pitch down even further because that&#x27;s what a plank wing does in the absence of pendulum weight provided by the pilot.

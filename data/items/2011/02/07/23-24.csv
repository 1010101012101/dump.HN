We are bootstrapped and looking to build mobile apps for the typical<p>devices - iphone, android, blackberry.<p>The app is video-centric, which means in order for it to work via web you need strong html5 video support or a Flash<p>plugin.  Today, only iPhone has great html5 video support and it works great with our web app.  Android claims to have<p>html5 video but it's a pathetic implementation (if you don't believe me, try for yourself).  It does have the Flash plugin<p>so at the end of the day we can tell people ""we support Android"".  But that's garbage...it should be a seamless simple<p>experience for our users to use our app on their phone.<p>Our resources are super limited.  I'd love to have a single code base for all mobile platforms.  I wish I could use jquery<p>mobile, sencha, motherapp, phonegap, or titanium.  Then I could literally build all the mobile apps myself.  The problem though is in video support.<p>The only one of the bunch that seems usable is Titanium.  It has an API for playing video - not robust but it could work.  It claims to build iOS and Android apps in native code (or equivalent of at least) and Blackberry in beta whatever that means.  However I've read plenty of bad reviews.  I had a bunch of problems installing it myself.  I don't want to write it off right away, so I'd love to hear your experiences.<p>I wish all the mobile OS's had great html5 video support.  But they don't.  Rather than spin the tires with something like Titanium, I'd like to hear from you great people and decide whether to bet on a cross platform solution or just make apps for each device.  Or, if it's possible, can I make everything in my app except the actual video interface in html and the rest in native code?",1297122951

Information density++<p>I honestly see this as obvious. I'm not trying to be funny. And I can't work out if you don't think this is obvious, or you don't agree that this would be useful.<p>Just imagine it on an ecommerce page: <a href=""http://www.google.co.uk/products?q=shoes&hl=en&show=li&lnk=showgrid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.co.uk/products?q=shoes&hl=en&show=...</a><p>Also imagine using it to fine tune an optimisation problem: you adjust a series of sliders that define the relative priorities you place on certain properties of the items in the dataset, it then does a weighted sort. You can see directly how the changes on the sliders affect the ranking of the items.<p>If you didn't have the animation it would not be easy to see which items had risen and which fallen. You would have to compare your memory of the order before the change with what you're looking at. This is cognitively very difficult, and it would lead to you toggling the value back and forth endlessly and comparing the order.<p>Basically any stat or inventory interface in a game would benefit from this. Or any interface where the task is solving an optimisation problem really.<p>Not <i>all</i> whizzy effects are gimmicks to be sneered at from the terminal. Don't throw the UX baby out with the eye candy bathwater.<p>EDIT: Another example - when toggling between different properties to sort the dataset by, the amount and speed of the animation describes the correlation of the two properties, <i>without requiring you to parse any text.</i> Animation is just another way to impart information that doesn't require reading, alongside color, size, and other spatial/physical properties.",1297122316

Facebook vs. Asana (where Asana is assumed to be some kind of unholy amalgamation of a wiki, exchange server, basecamp, MS project, and ... Things, say):<p>Facebook is kind of an _anti_-productivity application. Taking the Facebook approach to developing a ""live in it"" productivity application would be something of a disaster. I've been using using Facebook (fairly lightly, I'll admit) for years and still don't understand its structure. E.g. when I'm told ""so and so"" has made a comment on my wall or replied to a post or liked something -- I'm not sure where those things are to be found.<p>In the end, most serious people ""live"" in their email inbox to some extent or other (modulo some kind of discipline for not checking it too often or whatever) and anything that doesn't wrap around email is essentially a waste of time.<p>A tool that wrapped around email, [shared] calendar, [shared] to-do-list, [specialized reddit-like forums, and a wiki might have a shot (is this what asana is?

It seems hard to imagine now, but I95 had abandoned, jacked cars on the shoulder, right in the middle of the city. At some grim housing estate visible from one of the train or aboveground subway lines, I remember seeing thick trail of garbage a hundred feet long covering a wide stairway going down an adjoining hillside to another street. Lots of people sleeping rough in Penn Station, and aggressive panhandling. Natives warned me not to take the subway past a certain time.<p>Despite this environment -- or because of it -- there was also a lot of interesting cultural activity taking place in the city. Someone mentioned hip-hop originated there; it was also where American punk rock got off the ground, not to mention all kinds of art and theater activity.

If it was just 60% of our app that was copied, that's one thing.  But it's 99% of our app that's been copied.

The real message is when meeting with a friend you haven't seen in a while, make sure you set it up so you get a lot of calls, emails, and texts.

2191174,comment,2189624,2189624,0,0,S_A_P,,,"Having used Reason, Logic and a huge amount of audio software, I can only half heartedly agree with this post.  Ultrabeat and some of Logics other instruments(sculpture) are indeed examples of how not to do a UI.<p>Reason, for me is probably the most intuitive application I have used since I initially was plugging hardware cables to make music.  However, it certainly isn't the most efficient way to patch something, but with the huge amount of routing flexibility in that software, I don't see a better option, the context menu for cable patching isn't really an effective method either since its list can exceed the height of my screen in some cases.\nI find though that most audio applications(reason included) do offer very flexible and easy linkage to hardware controllers which makes life easier.  Most audio processing is about hands on control of many parameters simultaneously, and I think some of the best solutions(jazz mutant had some purpose built touch control surfaces) were much too expensive for the average user.  I really hope that someone can make a tablet based app equivalent for iOS/android that could mimic these types of things. <shameless plug> (any software vendors want a dev(me) who would LOVE to work on this sorta project?!?! :)</shameless plug><p>One other point that wasnt addressed properly in this article is that much of the ""hardware look"" UI chrome is due to these things being ""emulations"" of real gear.  I think the market has decided that if you want to model a piece of gear, you had better draw up a photo-realistic picture of it and add some 3dfx to the knobs and sliders.  For better or worse, a lot of users just dont buy into the sound emulation thing unless it looks like real device.<p>I have seen a lot of developers out there that have made some very functional very pretty UIs that also look like gear.  U-he, FXPansion come to mind. Interestingly, Logic contains some very clean and easy to use UIs(the included efx) along with the dogs like Sculpture and Ultrabeat.  Hopefully Logic10 will have a UI refresh to improve things...",1297119817

This was partially the reason some of the Big 5 spun off their consulting arms [2] [3].<p>Don't forget, a large chunk of the Big 4 brand is their ""independence"" and ""impartiality"".

Our testing, combined with legal requirements, has shown that we get the best results when fields are split apart and match the paper version of the form we are digitizing exactly.<p>>  If you need to match against another data provider, e.g. government database, then you should tell you users that. Tell them that you can't continue unless they ""enter their name the same as it's in their passport"".<p>We can't ask the user to ""enter their name the same as it's in their passport"" for a number of reasons including: we don't know what type of identity documents they have, foreign identity documents may contain name information in a different format than stored by the US government, it could be considered discriminatory.<p>The data is submitted to the government long after the users involvement with the process is complete. There's no way to have it checked in real time or while the user is still present. The government provides no useful feedback about what information collected was incorrect. We are simply directed to have the user contact one of several government agencies. Getting it right the first time is extremely important, trying to combine fields and break them out on the back end can lead to negative consequences for our users and liability for our clients if done improperly.<p>> I assume you users are interested in your service, so they will want to enter the correct information.<p>The users don't have much of a choice and when they were doing this process on paper they would routinely get it wrong. Making the electronic data collection process as error free as possible is much more important than a few seconds saved by unifying form fields.

2826075,comment,2824646,2825135,4,0,brianleb,,,"> not making it would involve millennia of avoidable human suffering<p>This premise assumes that in the situation where we ""don't make it,"" the total amount of suffering by the end of the human race would be more than one in where we ""do make it."" Given that human suffering is caused by <i>everything</i>, I would say that if the race were to survive, there would be infinitely more suffering because we would have more time to inflict it. The premise seems to take for granted that the only way humans suffer is through harming our environment, which is of course not at all accurate. The only way to avoid human suffering is to immediately get rid of all humans; being in favor of existence, I have to argue that this is a fruitless position.<p>Likewise, if animals can suffer, then the existence of animals causes suffering. Animals attack each other, eat each other, steal each others' food source and offspring. The only way to prevent animal suffering is to have no animals. If plants can suffer, then the existence of plants causes suffering as they compete for sunlight and nutrients and the 'losers' wither and die.<p>I suppose my point is: any argument that involves potential existence causing suffering must ultimately come to these conclusions. I don't believe there is any other choice. Plants will never stop competing, animals will never stop competing, and humans will never stop competing.<p>Also, if the crux of your argument is <i>avoidable</i> human suffering, then I would be very interested to know what defines <i>unavoidable</i> human suffering.<p>[Just enjoying my Saturday morning by carrying out some debate]",1312043420

Is it possible that attempting to involve him could make the situation even more complicated?<p>3. Whether or not the interference is even needed.

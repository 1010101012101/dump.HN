Ruby 1.9 is being used in production even though it's not completely stable yet. In short, Ruby is clearly evolving, major libraries are constantly being updated for the latest version of the language, and everyone in the Ruby community has a strong sense of ""getting better all the time.""<p>Python 3 is a better language than Python 2. That it's taken so long to become the canonical version makes me wonder about Python's future.",1278302326

Few worthy of reading, but not many.<p>While I certainly see the perspective of the author here, wanting to preserve the integrity of his work, invariably he faces the same crisis the mainstream music industry faces: refusal to accept the change in mentality about content distribution and consumption, and an ardent unwillingness to entertain the idea that maybe in order to attract new audiences you have to tickle their senses and find out what they want, and how to give it to them.

Somewhere, sometime, you'll ready enjoy what you're doing and you will look back at this sad time of your life and think: Damn, I'm so happy I didn't give up.<p>Also, it's easy to make friend and I agree with you that it's hard to be motivated to stick with them.. However, I'm sure you'll encounter real friend where you won't need to be motivated.. you'll just enjoy being with them as they will be part of your life. Same with girls.. once you'll find someone that you really like (and not only the first kick), you'll be actually happy to spend time with her and she'll help you to get more motivated.<p>Finally, next with the startup.. once you'll really enjoy your project, it will be so much easier to stick with it and get motivated.

No such faith comforts the software engineer.</i> Fred Brooks, p. 184 <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> 2nd ed.<p>It's interesting to me that several people I greatly admire in comp sci/technology are religious: Fred Brooks, Knuth, Larry Wall and Clayton Christensen (<i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i>).<p>To me, one aspect of the idea of God is as a workable label for all the things I don't know (especially those questions I know not of; the doors I have not suspected exist; the things my philosophy does not dream of; the <i>unknown unknowns</i>). Also helps me to seek questions (define problems) even if I can't imagine knowing the answer (finding solutions). It helps me to just let it be.<p>Another aspect is political: human beings, like other apes, tend to organize around a dominant male (and even chickens have a pecking order). When groups grew in size due to agriculture and civilization, this scaled to super-dominant males - gods embodied in persons (I'm thinking ancient Egypt). This was dangerous. The next innovation was to transfer that ""super-dominance"" to a person who doesn't actually exist. This is safer, and of course this imaginary personage can embody all those ideas an actual human can only move towards but never attain. Although wars were still fought in the name of a God, there was a separation. That's a   theory of mine anyway. Feel free to poke holes, build it up, tear it down (esp with evidence).",1278302018

I'd agree that I have a somewhat Kantian conceptualist worldview, in that I consider that I have access only to my own experience of the world, not to the world itself, so all knowledge is inherently subjective and particular.<p>But thinking this way, ""there is no truth"" is only a <i>synthetic</i> claim of truth, not an analytic one; that is, it is ""true"" because the terms are logically consistent with each other given the rules that define their context (i.e. language), not because it expresses an objective representation of reality.<p>In other words, given the subjective and particular nature of my experience of the world, I have no basis on which to construct a universal understanding of the world, so I am therefore <i>incapable</i> of making any analytical claim of truth in any universal sense.<p>More practically, I'd say that ideas, including the idea of God, and including the processes of science, are useful tools that enhance our experience of the world, not objective and ""true"" representations of the world, and are best judged on how useful they are, not whether they are ""true"".",1278301784

Your mind sounds a bit claustrophobic - that is to say, lots going on that's making you go crazy. Go find some adventure and get off the road you're on. Go do something that 'crazy' people do. One time I was really really frustrated, so I traveled around the world (sounds absurd, but that's basically how simple my thought process was and how little planning i did. I just convinced myself I could make it up as I go). Getting on the road will distance yourself from a lot of things on your mind, provide some clarity on things that are important, and make you focus on immediate problems - like where to sleep so you don't get robbed and how you're going to get from A to B because the bus route in the book or on the website doesn't exist anymore. You'll learn a lot about yourself by dealing with things as they come, by meeting cool people, and by seeing new markets for your ideas everywhere you go.

The parent poster has a point at some level, but he delivers it with no tact.<p>The point is that you need more than money to hire really talented people. It sounds as if Zed left Dropbox because the problems he was solving there weren't the type of problems that he was passionate about solving. The pinhead, middle-manager response to this is to get pissed off and rant against hiring ""rockstar"" programmers, but that just shows how little they understand about what motivates really talented people.<p>I can't speak for Zed, but I know a few talented programmers myself. I've brought them in on projects and seen them hit the door in short order. The #1 reason was never money. Great coders are artists. Their greatest work will always be works of inspiration, not portraits they're paid to paint by narcissistic clients.<p>The bottom line is, if you want to hire talented people, set out to solve interesting problems, or build interesting projects. And don't be upset if the ""rockstar"" programmer you hired doesn't want to keep doing what you're doing. Go out and find someone who <i>is</i> interested in solving those problems and pay them what they deserve.",1278299096

1487072,comment,1486910,1486910,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Great post. By the way, I have the answer to this:<p>> No credit<p>I had the same problem because I avoided credit cards when I was younger because I thought it was a bad habit, and I was self-employed so I couldn't verify any salary. It meant I had no credit and I got rejected for low end credit cards - a yucky cycle. Eventually a smart bank manager I knew gave me a plan to fix this:<p>I went into the bank and got a ""secured loan"" - what you'll do is deposit about $1000 into the bank (or whatever amount you want) and get a CD for it that you can't touch. It'll pay something like 2% in today's climate. Then you get a loan secured by that CD for something like 2.4% - seriously, the interest rate on a secured loan is very low because the bank has your CD sitting there and you can't get it... there's virtually no risk.<p>Okay, now, have your loan set to auto pay so you don't have to worry about it. You'll get 12 ""paid on time"" records in the next year and it'll cost you very little. Actually, it's a little better than that even, because it's a different kind of credit from a credit card. Credit cards are ""revolving"", this sort of loan is something else... so it'll permanently boost your credit a little bit for the next 7 years until it falls off your record.<p>I had no credit. Got a secured loan like this. 3 months later, was able to get a crappy credit card from Capital One, very low limit, high interest, no benefits. Just charged some small purchases to it and paid in full each month. After a perfect year between the secured loan and the Capital One card, was able to get an AMEX gold card with no limit on which was important because I was having business-related payments that'd sometimes be a lot in a short period of time. Also wound up getting two free one way international flights from the points from the card. So yeah - secured loan is the way to go. The difference you pay between the CD's interest rate and your loan interest rate is well worth it to have credit.",1278298838

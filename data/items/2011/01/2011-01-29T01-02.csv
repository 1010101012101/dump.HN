2154332,comment,2154106,2154193,0,0,grellas,,,"The idea of vesting is to prove that founders can build value before getting rewarded with their stock. When founders start, they usually need to build in some form of vesting to prevent one of them from just walking away with a windfall while the others continue to work hard to build value in the venture. Even then, however, if founders have already build some value before the formal structure is put in place, they will take their restricted stock grants with some portions immediately vested (usually 20% or so, maybe up to 33%). At Series A, the investors might insist that founders restructure their stock positions so that they have to vest at least a significant part over some period. This can vary but usually means that the founders get cut back so that only, say, one-third of their stock is vested, with the balance subject to vesting over a few years. This ensures that the investors will not get screwed and that the founders will earn out their positions as they use the investors' money to continue to build value. Finally, at the M&A stage, the purchase price is sometimes divided between a cash/stock portion that is given outright to the stockholders and another portion (usually an option grant) that needs to be earned out. The basic idea behind such a division is that x amount rewards them for the value they have built and the balance will reward them for continuing to add value in the future. Usually, the x part is by far the largest part of the consideration, with the balance (the part that needs to be earned going forward) amounting to, say, 10 or 20% of the total purchase price.<p>The consistent theme in all such cases is to make sure that those who have built value get non-forfeitable equity as a reward while those who need to prove themselves going forward get equity that can be forfeited.<p>If you have built true value, then, of $10M and you take your payment in stock that is 100% forfeitable, you set it up where you can be cheated out of all the value you have built with little or no legal recourse.<p>This is a HUGE red flag. I have seen founders do such deals and have begged and implored them, at the very least, to insist on 100% acceleration clauses in their employment arrangements should they be terminated without good cause. In the one case where the founders went through anyway without such protection, the company (a prominent public company) wound up terminating one of the main founders within months and all he got was a few crumbs for years worth of effort.<p>Check with a good M&A lawyer on this and then use your best judgment. It is ultimately your call, whatever the legal risks. But do it with open eyes and that means getting good help in assessing what those risks are.",1296265845

My own experience is that those have either to come from above, or be endorsed and supported by management.  Without that support (or directive) efforts will fail, and you'll possibly upset people along the way (although you may upset them anyway).<p>As it is, if you choose to stay, you may ask for a definition of 'productive' that they're using against you.  Is it lines of code?  Time to get 'feature x' 'live'?  Something else?<p>Once you have a definition, quantify the issues you're seeing - the number of bugs that are introduced by 'fast' developers is probably a prime candidate.  Ask that bugs be documented - either over a short time period or just outstanding bugs everyone knows of.<p>Get everyone to understand that speed != quality, and that getting stuff done 'fast' is most likely a false economy.  If you can get everyone or almost everyone to agree on some of those basics, you can then propose some new processes and measure the effect.<p>None of this will be quick, and it might not be adopted at all.  But... I'd suggest documenting this dispassionately, no naming of names or pointing of fingers to specific people.<p>If <i>you</i> are having problems getting up to speed, anyone else probably would as well, so even if they decide to fire you, they won't get anyone else to be as productive.  That's probably not actually true - it would depend on how they measure productivity.  If it's just a matter of people throwing code out in to production without worrying whether it works or not, then yeah, someone else <i>might</i> be more productive than you.  But it is a false economy over the long haul.  Also, any new person coming in has a huge learning curve, because there's institutional knowledge gone by not having documentation, unit tests, etc.<p>If they really truly do not see that, it's probably better for your own sanity to find something else.

Maybe there's some concern that if you walk away, this company could build their own whatever-it-is and beat you in the market, but it will take them some time and is not a sure thing for them.<p>The other thing to be aware of is the anchoring principle in psychology.  By lowballing you at the outset, they make the range of offers that will seem reasonable to you.<p>I have not sold a company.  But this sounds like a ridiculous deal to me.  3x revenues, in stock with a 4-year vesting schedule?  For a profitable business??<p>There's a key number here you haven't provided: what's your revenue growth rate?  If your revenues are growing slowly, then 3x revenues in cash might be a reasonable multiple.  But if you've been growing at 40% annually, then 3x is way too low; 6x is more like it, and 8x may not be out of the question, depending on how large the ultimate market appears to be.<p>The big question for you is how you would feel if the deal fell apart.  While you chew on that, you might want to see if you can find any other potential acquirers.<p>Involving bankers would change the tone of the discussion, eh?  To what, I wonder?  Really, this makes me angry -- it sounds like they're trying to take advantage of your inexperience.<p>It's your call, of course.

1. Take the deal as is. 
2. Negotiate the deal.
3. Keep working for 3 more years (3x revenue), and make the same money - salaries you would have made at BigCo, but PLUS you still have the company and money coming in for years after.<p>My calculation would be around 3: how exciting is that. Also, you have plenty to negotiate around. 3x revenue can be upped. Your employment conditions can be negotiated (ie. I get to spend 2 days a week on open source software, paid). Vesting can be negotiated (4 years is a really long time).<p>Or calculate it like this: current annual revenue = X. If you stay alone, assuming revenue will grow a little, work for 4 years and you get (5X + the total value of the company at that point, which is likely 4X-ish) = 9X. Work for 4 years in BigCo and you get 3X + salaries. (Adjust formula to take into account multiple founders etc). If your combined salaries would be about the same as your net revenue is now, it's a rather equal deal (except for the freedom). So it depends on how your salaries compare with your income now. A lot also depends on how you estimate the longevity and growth potential of your company. If it's gonna grow and keep going for 5 years, they're cutting you a bad deal. Also consider how much you could be making at some other company, in todays job market.<p>It's weird that you're sure you won't get another offer.<p>It also kind of sounds like a talent acquisition.

What's become more common now is to have very explicit control flow modeling so you have pseudo-edges from every place an exception can occur to the catch block (of course fewer with synchronous exceptions).<p>So when the exception is thrown you keep the frame on the stack, shove your IP, and go to the new handler -- like a function call.  From the handler you have five potential exit points:<p>1) Pop stack, jmp... continue control flow from where the exception took place,if recovery succeeds.<p>2) Fall out the bottom if it was handled, but not ""recovered"".<p>3) Go to next recovery handler in list, if there is one.<p>4) Unwind.<p>5) New exception.<p>With that said, there are as many ways to implement exception handling as there EH mechanisms.

2154210,comment,2154106,2154106,0,0,Umalu,,,"Step 1: Be sure you and your fellow founders are on the same page. United we stand, divided we... Key areas for agreement are (a) decision to sell, and (b) minimum price you'd accept. Nothing will expose cracks in your team's facade like M&A discussions. 
Step 2: Tell the buyer the price they've offered is too low, and offer to explain why. The first offer is just the beginning of the negotiation process. A buyer who is not willing to discuss an offer is not the sort of partner you want to work with. At it's best the negotiation process is a mutual education process, with you explaining your value and them explaining why your value isn't what you thought it was. At the end you'll either agree to disagree or you'll agree. If you agree, you'll do so for the right reasons (i.e., you are both roughly on the same page). While outside advisors can help here, the real work must be done by you, as no one will understand your business and its prospects better than you. 
Step 3: Ensure that the deal you've struck is a real deal. If the deal pushes a lot of the pay into the back-end, it is not a real deal. It is an option. Earn-outs and other back-end payment structures can help bridge a disagreement in valuation, so they have their use, but a seller who isn't desperate to sell should ensure that he is happy with the deal even if none of the back-end targets are satisfied. Otherwise he's traded his business for a dodgy option. Rarely a good trade. Here again advisors can be helpful, particularly for tax issues, but usually a good deal is  clear enough that you can understand it without the help of advisors. 
A good lawyer is essential. A banker less so.

The spirit was high during the first week but when I got exposed to the code base, it almost made me cry. There's just no quality in it. The dev team just doesn't have the proper skills and they don't keep good practices like using a version control system, unit tests, code reviews, documentation, so on and on.
There's so much code duplications and gotchas that every time I submit code, it takes days to figure out why my code isn't working (didn't set a flag in the config file, didn't update this in the database, so and so...). The bug fixes are hard coded as if statements and no formula makes sense in this code base.
Now just after a couple of weeks, my morale has dropped badly.
I have two options - to quit or to challenge the culture (and potentially make enemies).
If I quit, jobs are hard to find in country X where I am.
The other option is to challenge the dev team over the code base but they just doesn't understand anything I say (caching, refactoring, unit tests, etc...) and management is still pushing for new features and asking me why I'm not as productive as the other team members - who spend most of the time fixing and introducing bugs.

You're quite likely to get a much better offer (by either the current oferee (?) or another one), with just a few weeks of work.<p>Shop around, for real.<p>""Has (without saying so) implied that they make an offer and that is it"" -> standard negotiation practice.<p>Shop around, even if ""selling"" isn't your strong point.<p>Practically, tell them you need some time to think this through. Then, when you have another offer (either better or worse), tell them very briefly: ""We've had another offer. We don't want to turn this into a bidding war. We need some more time to think about our next steps."" (Of course you want to turn this into a bidding war.)<p>I once got an offer for a startup out of the blue, just after I decided I was tired of it (karma!). I was going to take it. My girlfriend told me to ask for 50% more, and they gave it to me with only a little pushback. I could have likely gotten double.<p>3x revenue in STOCK sounds like a BAD deal. 3x revenue basically means: if they pretty much abandon the whole thing and let it run out a few years, they'll still make money. If they offer you just 3x revenue, it should be cash.<p>Ask for 6 time revenue in cash, as your counteroffer.<p>If you're really doing well and in a growing market, I'll offer you 3x revenue in cash myself, that'd be a steal.",1296262863

The RDBMS world has really consolidated around SQL and there are a few major databases out there such that it's not too hard to pick which one you should use.  You can answer 90% of RDBMS selection questions with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.<p>The NoSQL landscape is not as well defined, and perhaps it covers so much more territory that it will never settle down.  Perhaps we will all be stuck using three different databases for their various features because we can't come up with a few technologies that are good enough for 90% of cases.",1296262809

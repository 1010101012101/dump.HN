10648621,comment,10639359,10644401,0,0,tommyd,,,"Just to add my experience here, I evaluated Flow and Typescript recently for a new project and found that while Typescript was more effort to get going with than Flow (things like needing .d.ts files for third party libraries which may not always exist on DefinitelyTyped, setting up the Typescript compiler config, etc.), the advantages of using it made it worthwhile.<p>Documentation and community support online for Flow seems quite light compared to Typescript - I get the sense it is mainly just used inside Facebook at the moment, and it was hard to find help for problems I encountered - and even with Nuclide, the IDE support for flow doesn&#x27;t touch Typescript&#x27;s (I guess partially because Typescript has definitions for the 3rd party libraries you use, which is usually quite a big part of JS programming) - the plugins for Sublime and Atom for Typescript are really impressive, as is Visual Studio Code - it&#x27;s hard to imagine going back!<p>Typescript also seems to offer a more complete &quot;correctness&quot; check of your code, I guess because it is compiling it - I found that Flow didn&#x27;t pick up on typos in things like imports, which led to runtime errors, whereas Typescript does. I also couldn&#x27;t get Flow to validate my React prop types - I was probably doing something stupid here, but the lack of docs made it hard to know what.<p>The final straw for me with Flow was that at a certain point in the project, my Atom/Nuclide started using all my CPU with loads of flow-server processes, and again, I couldn&#x27;t find a solution online, which made it useless to me.<p>Flow&#x27;s lightweight nature is still appealing and I will keep an eye on it, but at the minute, for a commercial project especially, I think Typescript is a better and more mature bet. Shame it doesn&#x27;t support non-nullable types though!<p>The main cost of using Typescript is the need to have definitions for third party libraries (although it is possible to create very basic &quot;skeleton&quot; definitions, just listing exported members as being of type &quot;any&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t give you type safety but is a quick way to get it to compile), and also interop with some &quot;cutting edge&quot; features like requiring CSS modules in a React component requires some hacks, but I think the benefit of having the code compile is worth it - I&#x27;ve found most of the time when a runtime error slips through, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used the &quot;any&quot; type, either in my code or for a library. I plan to write up my experiences at some point, as there&#x27;s not a huge amount out there about using TS with the latest shiny stuff like CSS modules.<p>Also one other note on Nuclide - I had terrible problems with the version distributed through the Atom package manager - it would completely freeze my Atom and use 100% CPU and the only fix was to delete ~/.atom and start from scratch. Installing it from source fixed this, and even though I am now using Typescript, I am still using most of the Nuclide packages as it adds a few nice features (especially the inline lint/compile errors, not sure which plugin adds these but they appear on mouse over whereas the default Atom ones don&#x27;t seem to). It does add ~10s to Atom start time, but otherwise doesn&#x27;t seem to impact performance too much.",1448877484

It&#x27;s quite achievable by a small team.<p>I did all my own CS, over email, for the first 6 years.  This was approximately 4 years too long.  Time to first response (TTFR) was generally on the order of &quot;I&#x27;ll get back to you by the next business day on a best effort basis&quot; -- I hit that on about 98% of customers for the first few years and then probably slid later, particularly when sick or overwhelmed.<p>My first (B2C) product had a lot of not-very-critical CS issues which also weren&#x27;t very complicated to resolve.  After having done that for 6 years, I hired a VA firm in the Philippines who staffed me with a single person for ~4 years.  I think it was 20 hours a month for $300 or so, IIRC.  I acted as tier 2 support for her.  She probably head off more than 90% of inquiries.  We used Snappy (BeSnappy) for CS software -- I enjoy it rather more than I do support over email, and it was easy enough for her to get spun up on.<p>I&#x27;ve also done B2B support for my other SaaS product, which has fewer users, fewer customers, fewer incidents, and <i>radically</i> higher maximum-criticality-of-a-ticket.  Again, did it all by myself for the first few years.  Eventually it became obvious that a supermajority of our support was onboarding for new customers, so when I hired a sales manager we mutually decided to roll that into her job description.  Our process is she firewalls me from any ticket she can and, if anything survives, she dumps it into Slack as a morning roundup every evening.  I either get her instant answers or tell her &quot;#3: ETA tomorrow.&quot;<p>My sales/support person works near my customers timezone-wise, so they generally get very quick &quot;Thanks for the email.  I&#x27;ll ask my tech guy about that and get back to you.&quot; acknowledgement for the harder issues (and very fast resolutions to the easier ones).  This makes for mostly happy customers, although to-be-fair most of them thought I was pretty responsive back when they wouldn&#x27;t even get first contact until a day after they had sent in the ticket.  I&#x27;m not competing with having a super-responsive startup team on speeddial; my customers expectations&#x27; are set by bureaucracies which take weeks to acknowledge receipt of the first of three things required to get the ball rolling on opening a ticket.<p>Fully-loaded cost for my sales/CS person is on the order of &quot;a few thousand dollars a month.&quot; for what I&#x27;d estimate as approximately 0.25 FTEs.  (Worth <i>every</i> penny in decreased stress level for me.)<p>Customers occasionally ask for 24/7 phone support.  I quote Enterprise rates for anyone who wants that.  No takers, thankfully.<p>I feel like the median experience of my customers getting CS from the team and myself is probably worse than it was when I was doing 100% of the CS, but it is not obvious to me that is true of their <i>perceived</i> experience, and we&#x27;ve managed to successfully manage expectations from customers about how much of my personal time is included for $29~$199 a month.  (A <i>particularly</i> good thing as I won&#x27;t be involved in that business much longer.)<p>Anecdata: 80% of CS incidents take < 5 minutes to resolve, 15% take < 20 minutes, and 5% take Way Too Long.<p>Favorite tricks for CS:<p>You&#x27;re going to get the same issues <i>a lot</i>.  Keep a list of them.  Fix the ones that are caused by fixable product issues, and keep fixing them until those go away.<p>Build self-help tools for the issues which are high-frequency low-value-added like, most obviously, password resets.  (Yes, there are still companies without automated password resets.  I know someone with a master&#x27;s degree who carries a beeper on Saturdays due to their company&#x27;s refusal to spend money on tweaking an application to allow password resets.)  Routine billing inquiries, etc are often also candidates for this.<p>You&#x27;re now looking at a long tail of issues, but it <i>still</i> has a fat head of the distribution.  Process-itize those issues which are amenable to it: you want to have a Google doc which explains exactly the company standard response to X, including what to say (templates optional) and what, if anything, needs to be done in internal tooling.  Do not extemporize a solution to the same problem 100 times: cache it and save extemporization for places where the team&#x27;s brainsweat actually adds value over &quot;the right answer delivered very efficiently.&quot;<p>Final thoughts: your expectations for CS are not your customers&#x27; expectations.  Your expectations for your company&#x27;s CS are not your customers&#x27; expectations.  Your desired outcome for a CS incident is not your customers&#x27; desired outcome.

I think it will be critical for the future of manufacturing (and especially for things like storage of energy) to find workable solutions using abundant elements.<p>Without the most critical infrastructure (for example batteries for storage of energy) being built using abundant elements there&#x27;s a strong risk of a lot of instability in markets in the future.  Shortages, etc.<p>I think if a workable solution exists using abundant materials (regardless if it&#x27;s the most perfect solution) it should be used.

Helpscout is far and away the best.<p>- Your reps need to be smart, talented, and close to the business. That means you need to handle all support inquiries until you can afford to hire someone. When you do hire someone, make sure they&#x27;re 5x more technical than you think they need to be. We hire developers as support reps.<p>- It takes us on average 2 replies to close a ticket. A reply takes us on average 6.5 minutes to write (some take 30 min, some take 30 seconds). Our tickets involve lots of debugging and weird stuff, so YMMV.<p>- Answer every support request as fast as possible. Our customer happiness ratings have a lot to do with how quickly the reply was sent.<p>- Treat support like a focus group. In a perfect world no one would ever need to ask you for help. If you get people asking the same question over and over, change your product to answer their question for them.<p>- Docs are a last resort.

But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really good though.<p>If you have a core set of skills and tasks you can often work very efficient. You know who to talk to, you know what to do, and if you spend time optimizing your work process after some time your daily life also is not too stressful. But if you always switch and hunt the opportunities you don&#x27;t know much about anything. You always have to continue hunting.<p>But on the positive side I think it will be an option, at least in a foreseable future. Being flexible also means you cna say no to an opportunity if it is too far away from what you are usually doing. Of course that also requires more discipline than in the past.<p>Concerning money I think it depends on your talent/skills/education if it goes up or down. Talent becomes more rare when people do more different tasks (e.g. the &quot;full stack devopser&quot; can only know a little about web development, because there are so many other things he needs to know). And higher flexibility for employees means that companies have a harder time to keep talent. Therefore pay must go up for talent. But someone who barely gets by doing one job now has an even harder time doing 6 jobs at the same time, and he has a harder time to hide due to more responsibility on his side, and last but not least more flexibility also means companies don&#x27;t need to keep you. Below the tipping point money goes down.<p>If one likes that or not probably depends on if oneself is above or below that tipping point. I can understand both sides here. No reason to discuss just the negative side.",1448874014

The showstopper for me has been the web application which was unable to power a medium size library with decent navigation / organization tools. One thing that Apple nails is that the &quot;moments&quot; feature is a very good replacement albums for lazy people,  as pics are grouped by time/location automatically. Google showed me a single stream and a search bar, which is too little to go getting that picture set from the summer last year.<p>Also, the main view in Google photos had infinite scrolling which is an ok technology for streams (Facebook etc.) but very bad for people needing to jump back to specific points.

It will be interesting to see the extent to which the FCC can regulate devices offered on a carrier. I'm hoping some sort of number portability / anti-compete clause lets them push GV through and force some openness on Apple's end in regards to app approval.<p>Unfortunately, the iPhone is NOT a publicly owned natural resource, but maybe phone numbers are.",1249105982

He wants a big box so he can do big joins because what he cares about is being able to match people across arbitrary criteria not, at sharding fanboys would do, separating them into separate pools by surname or a hashing function and then you never meet your perfect match because her records are in a different shard to yours...

736039,comment,734487,735163,0,0,gaius,,,"At my company about a year ago, we held a Java vs .NET seminar. The attendees were probably 10% .NET, 80% Java and 10% interested onlookers (like me). The main .NET guy stood up to speak. He said he'd done this project recently in Java and that project in C# and these were his experiences. He talked about the maturity of the tools, particularly VS vs Eclipse support for programming in the large, LINQ, he mentioned that in the Java world there were many competing frameworks whereas a C# developer could get up to speed on a project without having to learn a new one, a whole bunch of stuff. He was calm, articulate, prepared, and clearly had the attitude of ""the right tool for the job"" and ""what's best for the company"".<p>Then it was Java's turn. Their speaker hadn't prepared any examples, and he'd never used .NET. I scented blood in the water. This was going to be fun. It went something like this:<p>Him: Java is cross platform!
Me: So what? We only use one platform for all Java, the Ops guys insist on it.
Him: Java is used by lots of large companies including X, Y and Z
Me: All of whom write their major products in C and C++
Him: You can use lots of languages on the JVM!
Me: So the best thing about Java is that you don't have to use it? Is that all you got?<p>Then he prepared his killer blow:<p>Him: Java is <i>not Microsoft!</i>
Me: Haha, OK you got me there. No wait, there's Mono...<p>IMHO right now Java should be considered a legacy language, and Java programmers either assigned to maintenance or those who are good, retrained (not necessarily in C#, there's Scala for example). The JVMs are generally good and if you need a VM language on Unix then worth considering (tho' there are other VMs out there). Personally, I would advise against starting a new project in Java.",1249105460

736036,comment,733390,735288,0,0,pbsteve70,,,"I'm actually a long time developer trying to write iphone apps for a living. In app review purgatory for a simple app that can't possibly offend or harm any one (including Apple, AT&T or the user's batteries). I'm glad you've found your green fields. I'm having to play the game of ""what do I need to do like xxx who got approved so maybe I can get approved?"" instead of ""what is best for the user?"" I know from the web that I'm not alone. I'll also admit that I'm biased... the last 35 days in app review, while the product closest in functionality has 4 updates approved, has been emotional hell for this once=lifetime-apple-fanboy. If Apple is only abusing me, obviously, it will not hurt them. But I stand by my point that successful platforms that take their developers for granted will one day regret it.",1249105376

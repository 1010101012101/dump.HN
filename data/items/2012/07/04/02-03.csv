But some companies - and let's think of smaller start ups as an example - try to hire really well, and there are some shops that are loaded with talented people. Stacking them and firing the 'worst' performers because of a metric is basically just cutting talent.

One could make the claim that we should be doing everything in a completely resolution-adaptive way, but we haven't.<p>Second, developing for iPhone gives you the iPad for a negligible development cost, giving you access to the tablet market where Android does not have a meaningful presence yet. The great thing about the tablet market is that people spend more money on similar-functionality apps for iPad than for iPhone.<p>Third, the fact of the matter is that while you can make money on the Android market, the revenue economics of iOS apps are currently completely dominating Android. Both upfront and recurring revenue is higher on iOS. We don't have any qualms about leaving Android on the table <i>today</i> -- obviously, changes in any of these three premises, or huge growth in Android marketshare on tabloid and handheld, could change this.",1341369903

There seems to be  an idea in a lot of the other engineering departments that you have to suffer through the introductory classes in order to get to the interesting topics. The Stanford CS classes give people interesting challenges while covering a lot of the basics of CS. Of course there's still a long way to go after that, but it's a start. The second half of the introductory series is pretty rigorous, too, and I've seen at least a handful of interview questions I've been asked pop up in that class.<p>I don't know how many people were inspired by the iOS class, but it doesn't seem to be super popular on campus.

However that said, a better understanding of money and economics would ironically enable burning man to better set things up to create a space that is free from monetary concerns.<p>With the strategy that I proposed, they would be in a better position to make the event as big as it could possibly be at exactly the lowest price that breaks even.  And to do it in a way that limits the ability of scalpers to take money from people who want to be at burning man, while providing freedom for people who need to change their minds to actually change their minds.  (It also provides the ability to buy tickets with the purpose of gifting them to others, without having to worry about who those others might be.)<p>Think of it as a piece of economic judo, using economics to best produce a non-economic outcome.  In some sense it is not entirely dissimilar to how a copyleft license uses copyright law to achieve a purpose that is diametrically opposite to what that law was originally intended for.",1341368941
4197316,comment,4189811,4195147,1,0,einhverfr,,,"The database is not the model but the db operations are usually <i>in</i> the model, right?<p>My point though is in essentially shimming functionality.  In my example, for example, here is how it would work.<p>1)  User requests ""save this invoice"", which activates a controller script which automates the model elements for ""invoice"" instantiates an invoice (since this is a stateless web app) and saves it.<p>2)  The model saves the invoice by writing it to the db.<p>3)  Saving to the db fires a trigger which checks ROP vs on-hand and where ROP is greater saves a record in a queue table and issues an asynchronous notification, which doesn't have any immediate effect.<p>4)  Controller commits the db transaction.  The DB sends out the notification and makes the rows in the queue table visible.<p>5)  Controller for application b wakes up (let's say every 15 min) and polls for notifications.  Ok, we got one.  Look up the queue table, prepare the email (model stuff) runt he template (view stuff) and sent it out (model stuff again).<p>So what I am getting at here is a way to have model events have side effects which are outside the scope of Application A, but are at least triggered by model operations.  This is not an anti-pattern really because application A is not relying on those side-effects for operation.  However if you look at application A as the primary one and application B as contained within it, then application B can only be described as contained within the model of application A, from application A's perspective, because all of its functionality is abstracted behind the model.  From application B's perspective, there is a model, a view, and a controller, and it doesn't care as to where notifications and queue table data is coming from.  From it's perspective it is a loosely coupled app in its own right.<p>But as always what I am suggesting is that common sense usually determines the best place for a given piece of logic.  LedgerSMB is very model-centric but there are cases where we have a fair bit of logic in the controller.*  I think that anything which is inherent in the model belongs in the model.  So back to the vehicle analogy, a bike object should support a $bike->turn('l') and a $bike->turn('r').  However telling the bike when to turn left is the controller's job.<p>* for example in contact and employee management, the controller has to coordinate a lot of different model operations, leading to unusually long/complex model code in the system.",1341368884

The only points in your comment that I found persuasive, on the other hand, are that Windows is indeed becoming irrelevant, SQL Server probably has an edge over MySQL in some ways, and Exchange needs to die a quick death. The rest just doesn't fly.<p>Hatred for Microsoft doesn't exist any longer? Says who? I believe it runs much deeper and stronger than you realize. I haven't purchased a Microsoft product in well over a decade, and that ""purchase"" was a PC preloaded with an OEM license of Windows that I had no way of <i>not</i> buying. My loathing for Microsoft was sown over decades of the most user-hostile, winner-take-all, I-will-rip-off-your-head-and-shit-down-your-neck corporate culture I've ever witnessed. Bryan calling Microsoft ""predatory"" is being kind.<p>I'm not sure what ""OS field that has been gaining serious traction for the last 3 or 4 years"" refers to, but if you're talking about desktop computing, they are doing exactly the opposite of gaining traction: <a href=""http://twitpic.com/a31jis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitpic.com/a31jis</a> They aren't just becoming irrelevant to the elite; Microsoft is rapidly becoming just plain irrelevant.<p>How does C#'s popularity debunk Bryan's entire argument? A lot of companies still use Windows (for now), which means a lot of people use C# to develop applications for those computers. I don't see how this debunks much of anything.<p>SQL Server is good. Is it better than MySQL in some ways? Sure. What are the chances I'd select SQL Server instead of PostgreSQL? Zero percent. So that's a false equivalence right there, but that's besides the point. The reason people use MySQL or PostgreSQL instead of SQL Server is that <i>you don't need Windows</i>. Why tie yourself to a user-hostile company that's only going to charge you ad infinitum upgrades for a malware-ridden operating system? Even if SQL Server were heads-and-shoulders above MySQL/PostgreSQL, people would avoid it because you can't get it without Windows.<p>As I said, Bryan really nailed this: you're either burned so badly by Microsoft that ""hatred"" doesn't even begin to describe your feelings, or you're apathetic because the world has moved on and Microsoft continues to pretend like they live in the 1990s. With Ballmer at the helm, steering Microsoft towards seemingly inevitable obsolescence, Microsoft appears destined to eventually join Wang, Sun, RIM, Nokia, and the other dead or soon-to-be-dead. It didn't have to end that way, but reaping what you sow is generally the way the world works.",1341368391

In that case, here's a suggestion-- why not divide the US into, say, fifty separate geographical administrative units?<p>(By the way: I live in Norway, and was recently screwed over big-time by Norwegians looking to make a fast buck.  In my experience, the ""work ethic"" is far below that of hte US.  But I wouldn't be too quick to generalize....)",1211185610

The Middle ages had no TV, and entertained with bloody battles, torture and witch burning.<p>And right now, the age of TV is the most peaceful and innovative age in a long time.

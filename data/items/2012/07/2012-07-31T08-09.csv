The UK spent more money on the banks in one year than they did on science since Jesus (at least that's what I heard on some BBC show lately - however it's all way out of proportion).<p>If we spent just a comparably tiny bit more on science, I believe the advances would be absolutely huge. Science drives technology, which in turn drives the economy. It's a win-win for everybody and yet we keep putting our money into things that have proven not to work reliably in the past without a second thought.<p>(On a sidenote: I do tend to get quite angry when speaking about banks these days, please excuse that ;))",1343722665

We did nothing to stop these abuses.</i><p>Realistically, I'm not sure there's a lot the USA could do. When US forces arrest an Iraqi within Iraq, then it's a violation of Iraqi sovereignty not to hand him over to the Iraqi authorities. Given where Iraq is now (a history of repression, just becoming democratic), it would be extremely naive to expect Iraqi forces never to violate human rights.<p>Unless the USA wants to stay in Iraq forever -- which would be unacceptable to both the American and Iraqi publics, and would make the situation worse anyway -- they have to accept that some torture and other human rights violations will occur.",1290455965

Botnet sizes of tens of thousands of zombies are not uncommon.<p>It is a tough problem and the reason why DDoS attacks are so effective and therefor popular. They work.
When your site gets beyond a certain size, chances are you don't even have accesslogs for performance reasons because you get dozens of thousands of requests per second.
So finding the malicious requests and singling them out from the rest to be able to filter them is hard to say the least.
Plus every false positive could really hurt. Imagine you accidently filter some check-out requests in some online shop - that's a lost sale.<p>Attacks like the one outlined in the ""paper"" (it's really more a bunch of slides) can be easily defended against. They are not new just because someone alters the request method from GET to POST and wants to sell it as dangerous just to grab some fame.
The fact that they suggest a change in the protocol would be needed just reinforces my suspicion.
Announcing a flaw in a hugely popular protocol like HTTP gets you a sh*tload of attantion and in the end jobs.<p>I know a few people working for companies in the web-security field, some also member of OWASP.

I don't know who the author is, but it sounds like using one recruiter or nothing is the only option and that if you choose to work with a recruiter, you must do what they say.<p>In reality: Recruiters open doors and give you a shot at a job.  Sometimes the firm can't pay what they need to, sometimes the candidate isn't good enough for the role.  Thats why recruiting is challenging.<p>When I approach a hiring process, I am absolutely doing everything I can to make sure the deal has the potential for closing:
1) I do ask for the candidate's compensation expectations.
2) I do ask for the clients compensation expectations for the role.
3) I do frame things for both parties in order to get those expectations to line up.
4) I do share information with both parties on what is happening in the market (sometimes a company will think they need a junior guy with a 80k comp expectation, but if I tell them they are wrong, and that they need some with more experience in the 120k range, they listen).
5) I don't have perfect knowledge of everyone that is hiring in my industry.  I'm good, but especially in my niche of Quant Trading, its so secretive, there is just no way I can know everything (unlike realestate brokers that more or less have an industry database they can use to get good info on the market).<p>Ultimately, I will do what it takes to get an offer on the table.  If its too low, Ill try to get more, but sometimes that won't happen and then its up to the candidate to make a hard decision.<p>Your other points are all valid for executive recruiters (help with resume, deep domain knowledge, real relationships with hiring managers), but the vast majority of recruiters are in paper-pushing process shops where the person you are dealing with is purely gathering resumes, and not selling you in, learning about the market, etc.  I know that it seems like splitting hairs, but the difference is huge.  If you are making over 100k, dont both with the big companies, find a niche shop or an executive recruiting firm where the recruiter holds the hiring relationships himself.

They refused to allow Red Cross personnel to have access.<p>One can hide behind the fact that it was Iraqis doing this but given our sway over their forces this doesn't hold water with me.

Getting other people to do the dirty work is no less reprehensible.<p>The leaked documents show that our forces deliberately killed people while in the process of surrenduring.

1930915,comment,1928763,1930487,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Okay, another lesson I learned the hard way. People tend to like their own opinion more than your opinion. If they say you might be wrong, they usually want you to say, ""Wow, that's a really, really fascinating point you bring up. I'm going to strongly think about that."" Maybe not YCombinator, but like 99.99% of the rest of the world.<p>> As a word of advice to future single founders, they are going to aggressively push you the entire time. Be prepared to concede to them at some point even if they don't ""get it."" Otherwise, you will appear stubborn.<p>People need that. And y'know, you might be wrong. Or not. If you have a <i>great</i> reply, then maybe say, ""You know, that's a fantastic point, I spend a lot of time thinking about that myself. Can I show you the numbers I ran on that?"" Then show them, and say, ""I still think about it. Do you think these numbers look good to go, or would it be worth considering more? What would you do about that concern, in my shoes?""<p>I'm going to keep the details vague here, but I remember one time I was selling something. The client wanted something else, that was stupider than my idea. But I was swallowed my pride and did it their way. Y'know why? <i>Because I wanted their money more than they want my expertise</i>. Oh, it was still a good deal for everyone. But they demanded it a certain way, and okay, you've got the money, you win, let's do it your way.<p>You wanted someone's money. Okay, they win, let's do it your way. Well, not <i>that</i> wishy-washy. But ""I'll strongly consider that"" (and then do! maybe even follow up on that point later with a few page brief/plan/strategy or something) is good. If you've already got the answers, stress how you think the other side is <i>brilliant</i> to bring that up, and you think about it and worry about constantly. Nobody wants to give money to someone that makes them feel stupid.<p>I don't know. Maybe this doesn't apply to YCombinator, they seem like the top 1% of intelligent and savvy people. But the other 99% of the world, definitely.<p>Edit: Once you've got a proven track record for doing massively amazing things, you can maybe just tell people how it's going to be and insist you're right. But that comes much later. If you seem like a commodity at all, you pretty much have to do it the way the people who have the money want it. When they bring up a concern, they <i>really</i> don't want it dismissed by some kid as not a big deal. Even if you're right (which you might not be).",1290452870

1930912,comment,1929167,1930772,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Comp/bonuses went up for some. It went to zero for many others. In 1985, banks had armies of line workers processing trades, managed by officers making decent money. The average comp at a bank might be the average of 1 officer and 100-500 low level line workers. It would be better than other office jobs, but not great.<p>In 2010, the officer specs out business requirements after talking to traders and regulators, sends the high level work to IT and the CRUD apps to Bangalore. 475 of the 500 line workers have been replaced by a data center in Nutley, NJ, 5 remain in the US handling cash wires and other time-zone sensitive work, and 20 work via email out of an office park in Pune.<p>For obvious reasons, the average comp of 1 officer + 3 IT guys + 5 US line workers is going to be far higher than the average comp of 500 grunts + 1 officer.<p>Additionally, for many reasons (IT being one of the biggest ones), it's also vastly easier today to strike out on your own than ever before. In 1985, if you wanted to quit and start a hedge fund, it was tough. Today, a hedge fund can be operated by 3-4 guys + servers. Banks are forced to pay their traders enough money to prevent them from quitting and doing exactly this.<p>(Remind you of another high comp industry, with established players giving out big comp packages to retain talent?)<p>Edit (in response to your edit): <i>RE: hiding the big trades in noise. What's wrong with that? Why should they have to develop a special HFT algorithm in order to simply move shares around without getting their lunch eaten? This is exactly the kind of value extraction I'm talking about. HFT shops have now created a huge expense for these retail shops that didn't exist before..</i><p>When you make a large trade, there will be a price impact. This is unavoidable - if you are selling millions of shares, supply went up, and price must drop.<p>In 1985, institutional investors (not retail investors) tried to make sure that <i>other people</i> (their counterparties) suffered the price impact. They would sell shares at full price, retail investors (i.e., my Mom) would buy from them, and then shares would go down once the market figured out supply dramatically increased.<p>In 2010, some HFT shops will sell to my Mom at a favorable price, and then buy from the institutional investor after prices go down. This benefits the HFT shop and retail investors at the expense of the institutional investor. I'm not saying this is good or bad, I'm saying it benefits ""dumb money"" (little guys who can't afford to rent an algorithm) at the expense of ""smart money"" (Goldman, Vanguard, Calpers Pension Fund).<p>[edit2: just a disclaimer - specific numbers/cities should not be taken as precise. The data center might be in Jersey City or Brooklyn, Pune might be Cebu or even Baltimore, and there might have been 250 or 1000 line workers rather than 500.]",1290452792

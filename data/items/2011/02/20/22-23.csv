The 2D offset pattern is ""up-left, up, up-right"" for the vanilla version of the algorithm. If you want to support seams with a sharper slope, the offset pattern will be correspondingly wider.<p>Optimal game playing. Whenever the space of states is much smaller than the space of move sequences, you probably want dynamic programming. Example: The game state consists of a string of tokens, each with a point value. Players take turns removing a token from the string's left or right edge, adding its value to their running score. Here the move space grows exponentially but the state space only grows quadratically.<p>Pseudo-polynomial algorithms for NP-complete problems. You can think of these as one-player games analogous to the above two-player games where as before the state space has small size compared to the move space. A classic example is the knapsack problem with integer weights and a small knapsack; here the table offsets would be the different weights.<p>I've long loved this quote from Steve Skiena:<p>""Once you understand it, dynamic programming is probably the easiest algorithm design technique to apply in practice. In fact, I find that dynamic programming algorithms are often easier to reinvent than to try to look up in a book. That said, until you understand dynamic programming, it seems like magic.""<p>When I first read this as a kid having a hard time grokking dynamic programming, I thought it was bluster. Now I know it's the absolute truth. You could even argue that dynamic programming should be considered a single algorithm rather than an algorithm design technique, but that might be going too far.",1298242565

2243419,comment,2242805,2242805,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This was a hugely significant change in the climbing community at the time. There was real risk involved in climbing ""clean"" without pitons. A piton hammered into a granite crack is very solid protection, it's pretty straightforward to find where to place one and to place one in a manner such that it will hold a fall. In contrast, it takes a lot more skill and experience (neither of which existed anywhere initially) to place a hex or a nut correctly. And if you place them incorrectly, or even if you sling them incorrectly, there's a very real risk they can pull out or not hold a fall. Moreover, passive protection of this sort only works in certain kinds of rock, some of the more popular routes at the time were cracks which were very hard to protect.<p>This meant that a lot of very popular routes became a lot more dangerous to climb cleanly. To their credit, the climbing community just accepted that and moved on.<p>It wasn't until the late 70s that cams (SLCDs) were invented and clean protection devices attained sufficient breadth to protect very nearly any climb that could have been protected with pitons.",1298242532

What do most commercial websites want to forcibly focus your attention on right here right now?  Yeah.  Adverts.<p>It's an arms race.  Advertisers will always use the most in-your-face tool available.  First it was banner ads, before Javascript and pop-ups became common.  Banner blockers appeared.  Then it was pop-ups, until the broader community and browser vendors decided that the S/N ratio for pop-ups was so low that we were better off killing them entirely.  Then it was Flash, with the added benefit of literal noise... and now Flash-blocking is an essential component of any browser.  The current advertising tool of choice is lightboxes and other floating divs: harder to automatically distinguish from actual desired content within HTML, but we're starting to see browser addons and tools that can do that blocking job too.<p>Currently gaining in popularity is requiring that an advertisement appear and be experienced in its entirety before any access to content at all.  Hulu led the way on this.  Well, unless you count television and radio which discovered that format about sixty or ninety years ago.

I'm getting outside my expertise here) and get a similar benefit vis-a-vis not having to write a parser.<p>Edit: I'm betraying my C heritage by saying ""linking the Common Lisp runtime.""

2243285,comment,2240893,2242632,0,0,A1kmm,,,"There is more than one interpretation of what does and doesn't violate the DMCA, and the 6th and Federal Circuits have taken one approach, which makes the DMCA less applicable to non-piracy activities, in Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components and Chamberlain vs Skylink, while the 9th circuit has taken an approach that makes a wider range of activities violate the DMCA in MDY Indus. LLC v. Blizzard Entm't, Inc.<p>This is probably a major reason why Sony is trying to sue geohot in California (under the 9th Circuit) despite the fact that the claim that California has personal jurisdiction over him in relation to his Playstation activities is extremely weak.<p>The plain text of the DMCA anti-circumvention clause is:\n""No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title""\nInterpreting this as congress intended is difficult, because often, systems which prevent their owner from doing one thing will also try to prevent their owner from doing other legal activities - for example, installing their own operating system, developing their own homebrew games using only their own copyrighted material, repurposing hardware for purposes that the manufacturer never intended, and building compatible add-on products or accessories that compete with the original vendors products.<p>I believe the intention of Congress was that circumventing the system only far enough to do one of the above, with the intention of doing one of the above, is not ""circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected"" - for that act to be complete, and the circumvention the act references to occur, the final step of accessing the copyrighted work needs to occur. The interpretation of the 9th circuit is, in my opinion, not what congress intended.<p>Sooner or later the Supreme Court will hear one of these cases, and hopefully will agree with the 6th and Federal Circuits that the interpretation I gave above is correct.",1298239682

If the founder(s) are the sort of people to get the _other_ few dozen (or hundred) important things about launching a new business right (or at least mostly closer to right than wrong), then minor hurdles presented by ""legacy"" programming techniques are unlikely to have make-or-break effects on the business outcome.",1298239594

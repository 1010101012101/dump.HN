If the utility you offer them for working is less than the utility they get from being unemployed they won't take the job.<p>There may be enough labour to keep everyone employed, but not enough of that labour has a high enough value that it's worth while for people to do it, and thus you have unemployment.",1253609629
836576,comment,836237,836462,0,0,tensor,,,"Does bloat mean too many features? In that case I'd say those features are there because someone needs them. They don't all have to be loaded. In a monolithic kernel that has modules, load the ones you need. In a microkernel, load and unload as needed on the go.<p>Then there is the support issue. In Linux, all the modules must be maintained by the kernel team. This may constitute bloat as the team may have an unnecessary amount of code to maintain. Some modules may only be used by a few people. The issue isn't the features, but rather Linus's philosophy.<p>From his posts, it seems he like to keep changing kernel APIs as he sees fit. If you have many modules, this creates problems. Without a strict API, you will frequently break modules and thus create a lot of maintenance work. Fixed APIs are both very important and very good for large scale collaboration. Without standards like POSIX or the Windows APIs, we wouldn't be where we are today.<p>The second aspect to this is security. Say you built a very stable API and let others make modules as they need them. In a monolithic model, to maintain security you must audit every module. Thus for Linux to stay secure, the kernel team would need to either declare many less used modules as ""tainting the kernel"" or audit them all: a lot of work. In a microkernel model, the kernel team, so long as they designed it right, can let users build modules without audit.<p>Saying something has too much bloat is ambiguous to the point of being useless. Many people use that term simply as meaning slow, or a lot of code, or even poorly designed code. It's always better to describe things precisely. If it has too many features, say so. If it has bad design, then state that.",1253609556
836575,comment,836237,836291,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think this shows the amount of bloat in an Open Source package increases with how widely used the project becomes.  As an article posted a couple days ago on HN pointed out about 75% of Linux development is done by corporations these days.  Those corporations often times create the same ""good enough"" code that most proprietary developers do.<p>Now the theory behind Open Source is that developers around the world can see bloat and fix it.  But with very few exceptions the corporate developers aren't going to make their code more efficient.  So you have 75% of developers creating bloated code and at best 25% left to fix it.<p>Meaning the amount of bloated code easily overwhelms those volunteers who are willing and able to fix it.",1253609545

For example, so much in university is already set up for you -- constructing your own lab in your basement, calibrating machines, writing custom software to run experiments, etc. would be quite a learning experience. (I'm talking about experimental fields here.)<p>But more importantly, in universities you are guided away from things that do not work usually without entirely understanding why. Through independent study, you would go down these incorrect paths and have a much richer understanding. Instead of doing things how everyone else does them, you'd gain new perspectives than the status quo, and this would give you a leg up.<p>Of course, this all presumes that the student is extremely self motivated. Unfortunately, even at the graduate level these students are very rare. This is why some professors are very hands on and others are very hands off -- different students work best at different levels of independence.",1253608359

    so? Scribd certainly didn't.

From those facts I concluded:<p><pre><code>    Scribd make no effort to ensure that copyright is
    not breached. There is no traceability.  Their
    ""efforts"" are ineffective and insufficient.

836539,comment,836154,836234,0,0,a-priori,,,"I think I can explain that. One thing that may be surprising about vision is that when you look at a scene, what you see comes from your memory of the scene (first iconic memory then visual short-term memory), not directly from your eyes. These memory buffers are refreshed from information received from the eyes, and most of that comes from the fovea in the middle of your field of view. That's where they placed the pixel.<p>(You do obviously get some information from your periphery, but not much. As an example, you are colour-blind in your periphery. The rods that detect light there cannot differentiate colours. If you see colour in your peripheral vision, that's because you remember the object being a certain colour from when you looked directly at it.)<p>The eye usually moves in jumps, called saccades. There are many other eye movements, but saccades are the most important for scanning a scene. While the eye is moving during a saccade, you receive no visual information. This is known as saccadic masking. That's important for making a device like this, because it gives the little chip a few milliseconds to do its business in peace.<p>Okay, so how do they make an ""E"" appear using only one pixel? My guess is that they have a small accelerometer on the chip that detects saccadic eye movements, then turns on and off the pixel depending on where the eye is pointed. As long as you can detect the start of a saccade, predict the target (acceleration is linear over short distances so at the midpoint it begins decelerating; at that time you've travelled half the distance and can predict the target), and refresh the pixel all in less than the duration of the saccade, you're set.<p>Because of saccadic masking, the person won't see any of this. In a series of these movements, the eye will scan the scene, detecting the edges of the ""E"", and from knowing where the edges are, the brain will reconstruct an image of the letter floating in space.",1253607051

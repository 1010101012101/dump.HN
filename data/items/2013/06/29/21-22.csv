This did leave a very negative impression on all sorts of people, from developers to managers to executives to the end users who had to use these applications written in Java.<p>Thanks to hardware, JVM and Java class library advances, it isn&#x27;t as much of a problem as it once was. But there are still many people out there, especially in the corporate and small business world, who are forced to use Java apps on desktops that are a decade old, if not older in some cases. These systems often weren&#x27;t very powerful to begin with, and due to budgetary constraints they may not be able to upgrade them. It&#x27;s not a pleasant situation to be in.<p>So while Java may appear fast enough on a powerful server, or a modern development workstation, this isn&#x27;t an experience that everyone using Java applications gets to share in. When people suggest that Java is &quot;slow&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate to discount what they&#x27;re saying.

The reality of modern graphics cards is that most of the action happens on the card, not on the host CPU.  Combine that with Intel&#x27;s recent IOMMU technology and you find that exploits usually aren&#x27;t that interesting.  Even if you can get control of the card, you can&#x27;t do much with it.<p>Of course, there could be a flaw in the host driver, but it would have to be a really unusual flaw.  WebGL itself stops almost all invalid input (and some unsupported valid input) from being sent to the driver, so you&#x27;d have to find a perfectly reasonable set of polygons that still triggered an exploit.

5963710,comment,5962493,5963155,2,0,waps,,,"About creating your guild : it&#x27;s very simple.<p>We return to the situation in the Roman empire, or the middle ages : politicians should no longer listen to scientists at all, so there is nothing to be gained by having scientific analysis turn out one way or the other. Ideally not just politicians, but everybody. Then your club would get back to normal.<p>The problem is that these scientific analyses carry a lot of weight, and affect monetary outcomes of individuals and organisations by influencing the government.<p>I would say the big victim of this thinking is not so much the science that goes one way or the other, but rather scientific theories that point out that it&#x27;s impossible to know certain things. A lot of important sciences exhibit chaotic behavior, like economics, biology, medicine, even climate. This means there are stringent limits to how much we will ever know about them, and that it is perfectly explainable why statistics will (to varying degrees) suddenly fail to work on numbers from those sciences.<p>But while you can get a lot of money, researchers and positions for investigating why something is true, or why something is false, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get resources when you claim that humanity as a whole can never make progress on investigating some phenomenon because there&#x27;s some mathematical rule preventing that. Even in cases where it&#x27;s effectively an undisputed fact that the central limit theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, people refuse to accept that things like average do not have a well-defined meaning for things like stock prices, or economic indicators.<p>This seems to have become a central axiom of modern thinking, that science predicts everything. Even when people know the various basic principles preventing that, like Godel&#x27;s theorems, or the basic axioms of statistics, they will deny the obvious consequences. Even if we do find the  famous theory of everything, we are hardly done. Mathematics leaves a lot of real situations &quot;undecided&quot;, and of course reality doesn&#x27;t leave anything undecided. And even people knowing that you absolutely need the central limit theorem for any statistical rule to apply, refuse to give up their numbers when you demonstrate that it does not apply to their dataset. In most cases, that&#x27;s easy : you demonstrate that at least one reasonable approximation for their data is a divergent series. At that point you&#x27;ve proven statistics doesn&#x27;t apply to the dataset. It&#x27;s easy to do this for lots of data, like stocks (because bad news amplifies, and can kill companies if the amplifier can be > 1, which is easy to find in the dataset), and it&#x27;s easy to do that once you&#x27;re outside of a trivially small range, the values of, say, solar irradiance are divergent, which means that whatever the statistical average is up to now, contains exactly zero information. You may as well roll the dice. The confusing thing is that it &quot;generally&quot; works in the short term, which is to say it&#x27;s a huge effect that has lots of mass and needs time to move around, so it looks like a trend, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a sudden change taking effect. Like when you have an approaching storm, the variance in any specific location looks like a smooth change, a trend, that lasts days or weeks, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just the effect of a binary event that is the storm passing through, there is no trend.<p>We have collectively decided as a species that science answers every question definitively. Even if science itself proves that to be false.",1372539780

In the neoclassical world (I studied and degreed in the study) growth factors are all engogenous to economics:<p>The Neoclassical Growth Model, where output is a function of current stocks of capital and labor:  Y = A K^ L^(1- ), and capital accumulation is simply a function of investment and captial depreciation:  K = sY - K<p>The AK theory, which reduces growth to aggregate capital:  Y = AK.<p>The product-variety model (Romer, Dixit & Stiglitz):  production as a function of summed intermediate production functions based on capital<p>The Schumpeterian model, output is based on a productivity function (technology, assumed to be increasing without limit, and capital.<p>Technology increases.  Inputs are perfectly substitutable.  Innovation will produce substitutes.<p>And that&#x27;s straight out of the first chapter of a graduate level text in economic growth (Aghion & Howitt, <i>The Economics of Growth</i>, ISBN 978-0-262-01263-8).<p>Then there&#x27;s the whole class of heterodox economics:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodox_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodox_economics</a><p>Among these, the fields of thermoeconomics / biophysical economics / ecological economics, in which a, if not <i>the</i> primary factor relating to economic growth is energy. Many of the contributions to this field come from outside the field of economics, particularly  from ecology, biology, and physics, but there are also a number of classically trained economists:  Kenneth Boulding,  Robert Ayres, Charles A.S. Hall,  Robert Costanza, Herman Daly, H.T. Odum, and others.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodox_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodox_economics</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoeconomics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoeconomics</a><p>Further work is being done by a wide range of people, some with training in finance and business, but &quot;unbrainwashed&quot; (in their own words) by economic orthodoxy.  Gail Tverberg of Our Finite world (<a href=""http://www.ourfiniteworld.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ourfiniteworld.com/</a>) is key among these. Joesph Tainter has an extensive study of collapse of complex societies with profound implications for the Western European, now global, civilization.<p>When I look at the predictions and statements of mainstream economists, I see huge amounts of wishful and/or fuzzy thinking, and a long string of disappointments.  When I look at the track record of the energy-oriented heterodoxy, I see a  much stronger record.  I tend to consider my own degree &quot;economic woo&quot; -- more similar to astrology and alchemy than astronomy and physics.<p>Not that it&#x27;s _all_ bunk:  markets are useful (though highly imperfect, and rare) concepts.  Changing the relationship of money to underlying real wealth (which I&#x27;m increasingly convinced should be measured in fungible energy units, localized (and yes, that reads &quot;FUEL&quot;), and even predictions of how people generally _do_ behave (though not how they _should_) can be useful.  But in planning and plotting a long-term path through the future, I&#x27;m increasingly fearful that economics is the wrong tool for the job, and that collectively we&#x27;re going to have an Alan Greenspan moment, in which we find we&#x27;ve been grossly mislead by our belief system.",1372539678

It's a shame the graph misses data form countries like Italy or German, both countries provides free universal health care.",1262522948

Facebook will be replaced unless they manage to change in time. Perhaps personal websites that can be more easily connected to others will replace the need of a central hub?<p>I think that it's just a matter of time before a major incident forces people to think about privacy. We will see an advanced search engine that can find out more about you than you want to, and/or some sort of 3rd party service that sells information to advertisers. That will certainly cause a lot of panic. I am almost sure that this will happen soon (within 2-5 years)",1262522288

This would be all right with me then.<p>Of course, this would raise the storage cost because the service provider can't use deduplication on all the user's data. The storage provider also would be unable to use data mining on the data. Thus, it probably could only be offered as a payed service.",1262522045

1028466,comment,1028418,1028418,0,0,maxklein,,,"Balsamiq has twice as many twitter followers as Facebook 'Fans'. I'm strongly of the opinion that the word 'Fan' and the way it shows up in your Facebook profile makes Facebook pages a lot less useful for businesses. I want to get info about balasamiq, but I am not ready to describe myself as a fan to everyone on my facebook friendslist, considering that I've not used it.<p>Facebook should allow you to 'friend' a business without having to be a 'fan' of it. I think if they allowed this, facebook interaction between business and normal users would be much higher, considering the much larger facebook userbase.",1262521471

Some martial arts discourage hurting the body, in stark contrast to those that seem to promote it.  Personally, the philosophy of Chayon-Ryu matches me really well.  If you do a bit of research and try out some styles that look promising to you, you may find one that you like.  I recommend checking out aikido, which encourages safety and does not require much physical strength.",1262521089

138282,comment,137840,137840,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Not doomed at all. Less chance than programmers? Not even. I know a product manager-ish person and he leads projects from proposal to finish for his company. He reads a description, drafts a spec, and scrutinizes every step.<p>The advantage of being a programmer yourself is that you have intimate knowledge of what's not possible, what is, what limitations there are, and what approaches to take. If you know enough of the whole plan, leave the details to others. All you need to know is what you want to do and <i>exactly</i> how to do it, not as in ""we will do a POST XHR here,"" but ""the user submits this, and we will look for this keyword, and they will see that."" If you can write a good spec, you're good to go.",1205690283

138276,comment,138149,138167,0,0,neelesh,,,"I used a slightly different approach of combining acts_as_tree (for faster updates/inserts) and added a dotted_id for faster reads. The dotted id is a string,as in  0001.0002.0007.  Index this column and its fairly fast. The obvious limitation this approach creates is the depth of your comment tree.  approx =dotted id col size/#of digits in max pk -1. Not an issue for many.  When Im updating the hierarchy , I update root of the hierarchy being moved and then a single UPDATE to update the dotted ids in that subtree. \nIf you are using MySQL, then the max length of a column that can be indexed is also limited. Don't remember the exact length.",1205690076

138274,comment,137978,137978,0,0,bkrausz,,,"I'm not working full-time because of college.  I've heard many arguments for/against it, but I do feel that a degree is a useful and worthwhile plan B in case you do need to go to a big company for a paycheck.  So for now I hack away on weekends (and weekdays, and whenever I'm not working on homework) in hopes that when I do get out of college I won't necessarily need to cash in on that plan B.  That, and if I dropped out of college my family would disown/dismember me :).",1205689950

138270,comment,137924,138128,0,0,gnaritas,,,"I don't misunderstand at all, I know it's an application, but applications can be built with standard HTML and Ajax as well, see the Seaside/Arc framework for a good example of just how easy this can be with continuation frameworks.<p>I said RIA's have their place, they'll succeed a small amount on the desktop where they can be <i>forced</i> upon workers, but on the open internet where they have to compete against web applications, they'll get their butts kicked, as they always have, because they don't force openness.<p>Allowing the developer the option to hide the code is a fatal flaw, people learn by modifying examples, and that's what makes HTML/JavaScript so unbeatable and viral.  When a teenager attempts to learn to program, he'll choose  HTML/JavaScript over any RIA platform precisely for that reason, the barrier to entry is much lower.  Given the choice to hide their code, most developers will and that creates a barrier to new developers learning the technology.<p>RIA's aren't new, the idea isn't new, this is what Java was all about, applets, ActiveX components from Microsoft, and Flash from Adobe have all been able to do this for years as well, and they all failed miserably to gain wide adoption.  Flash found a niche doing video, but beyond that most developers hate it.<p>This new batch of RIA's will fail for the same reason, in the end, users don't want them, developers do, to protect their intellectual property.  Users don't give a rats ass about a developers intellectual property.<p>Users are perfectly happy with web apps that use standard controls they understand. RIA's give developers too much freedom to deviate from the normal conventions users are accustomed too.  HTML's constraints aren't a weakness to be escaped from, they're a strength that forces you to focus on providing value to the user rather than the mental masturbation of playing with and using non standard widgets that in the end mostly just confuse the average user.<p>RIA's will always have their place, and it'll always be secondary to HTML/JavaScript, unless an open standard is developed for RIA's that isn't owned by any one company and doesn't require any plugins to run, and doesn't allow developers the ability to hide the code from the users.",1205689678

138267,comment,138243,138243,0,0,bkrausz,,,"Interesting idea, but the problem is many people use social news as a quick way to view/post/discuss things.  The time involved in solving puzzles offsets that convenience, i.e. it can discourage posting because of the time necessary to make your post heard.<p>Though it would be funny to see porn sites have you solve a puzzle to view some pics :)",1205689384

Luckily I've found an employer supportive of my startup (was originally a consulting customer) and has let me structure my day job to get more time than nights and weekends to work on it.<p>I went at it full-time for 6 months when I first launched and it didn't fail, I just ran out of money to sustain a salary. That was 18 months ago, I'm still solvent and quitting working at it full-time was probably the best thing to do for the long-term viability. My goal has always been to get going on as little resources as possible so that if it failed, it wouldn't be a huge disaster. So far, so good.",1205689191

I do find the notion helpful for classifying user experience though.<p>I consider the most sophisticated apps today to be web 2.5 (""service web""): cross-site APIs/widgets and the resulting mashups.<p>And then web 2.0 (""social web"") as single sites with readable/writeable content. Forums, social news, sharing sites.<p>Web 1.5 (""application web"") as writeable sites. Webmail, instant messaging, site builders, search engines.<p>Web 1.0 (""document web"") as single sites with solely readable content. Blogs, arcades, galleries, oldnews, papers, homepages.<p>When we integrate structured portable data, the social graph, cross-device interfaces, and decentralized identity, I think we'll have something to call web 3.0.",1205688485

138259,comment,137978,138047,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"(2) determines a level of a ""competitive entry barrier"", and as such it's really a part of (3).<p>The harder the idea is to copy, the more time you have for the app to mature. Any new idea needs real-world tweaking, e.g. the actual use of the app may end up being different from what you envisioned, some non-obvious features may be in a high-demand, unforeseen scalability or usability issues may surface, etc. The longer you have to address these issues without worrying about users leaving to the competitor the better.<p>Writing an actual copycat app is a different game altogether. I don't have an experience with it, but the common sense suggests that it's not worth doing unless there is a large, under-served market segment <i>or</i> all existing solutions really suck. Hoping to bite a piece out of established market with a couple of (flashy) features is not a very smart thing to do.",1205687716

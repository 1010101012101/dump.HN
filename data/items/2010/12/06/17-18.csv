1976105,comment,1973516,1973516,0,0,thecoffman,,,"""Masters of Doom"" by David Kushner<p>It'd been on my list for quite awhile but I just got around to it a few months ago. It was fascinating to read about all the games I'd played growing up. For those who haven't read it - it covers pretty much the birth of the gaming industry as we know it today not just Doom. It goes all the way back to when Romero was writing games and sending them in to magazines to be included on disks. Carmack has always been an icon for me so it was interesting to read about him on a more personal level.<p>In addition to the interest factor - it was also quite inspiring to me. It certainly increased my drive to get stuff done. If the early history of PC gaming interests you at all; or you just want to read a page turner of a book about people not that dissimilar from you I'd highly recommend it.",1291658239

This page is a tree, not a list, and should be treated as such. It currently has 27 children, 3 of which mention Wikileaks.<p>That you have to scroll past the entirety of those 3 children's discussion to get to what interests you is an incident of the way the comment tree is rendered by default. If tangential threads started collapsed and had to be expanded (assuming there's come clever way to detect tangential threads, or just people such as yourself to tag them), your complaint would vanish, with no change to the ratio of Wikileaks posts:""on-topic"" posts.<p>And just as, well, a <i>tangential</i> argument: if someone is planning to avoid using all AWS products, they will avoid using this one as well, thus making such avoidance relevant to the story. What you're reacting to is the fact that the topic has already been <i>beaten to death</i> in other HN threads, not that it's particularly irrelevant to this one. For a while now, I've been thinking that we need some form of super-threading (such that article posts which form a sequence will have a single, merged comment thread), but now I'm starting to think we need aspect-oriented threading as well—such that this sub-thread, with its connection between this article and Wikileaks, would actually appear in the comments of both super-threads, and if you had hit ""ignore"" on the Wikileaks thread, the comments in here that also apply to it would disappear.

The second paragraph is just paraphrasing the standard calorie-in->energy-out theory of weight gain and averaging the 'graph' of weight gain for analytic purposes. Ie. he never states that you are storing exactly 19 calories per day, simply that over 20 years, you are storing an 'average' of 19 calories per day.

1975896,comment,1975296,1975296,0,0,harry,,,"I tried this when it made the HN rounds about a year ago. My results were over about three months and my primary reason was to assist treating moderate eczema. I stopped using all soap and shampoo and just stuck with hot-as-hell water. My skin did get better, but after about two months my hair began to naturally dread. After I looked back on my notes of this endeavor I decided to use some scent-free shampoo to prevent dreads. I use soap to clean up when I finish painting/working on a car or other dirty project. I also use it before I prepare food for my family and friends. My hair did never really 'feel' right, much more like a dogs fur than clean hair. It didn't smell bad it just felt different and didn't behave.<p>The interesting thing that came out of my tracking this impromptu 'shower log' of no soap use - I was able to correlate my severe eczema outbreaks with inhaling allergens. In my case, breathing in pine dust & glue particulate causes outbreaks. I now wear my painting respirator 75% of the time in the shop and have very few incidents.",1291655189

The way I see this happening is a robotic inner-city courier that can live with humans on a sidewalk. The feasibility of this is no longer pie-in-the-sky, now it's merely ""on the horizon"". Once you have this, it becomes actually economical in another couple of years. Once it becomes economical, there are too many of them on the sidewalk and you start considering things like giving them their own lanes, or their own paths through buildings, or, eventually, their own access to underground tunnels. From there somebody works out that they can make money building a tunnel from Manhattan to the rest of the city, and the network starts forming.<p>The advantage of this approach is that once you have such robots you can start using current systems. Put a dedicated car on an otherwise normal freight train for these things, for instance. Eventually you've built a hybrid system that can accommodate all sorts of approaches.<p>It ends up looking like the Internet and will probably recapitulate its development. There's no point stringing a tube across the country from one endpoint to another unless you've got a network already working on both ends. Attempts to bootstrap will generally fail because they will be too focused on top-down deployments of massive tubes that won't be useful for years; the winners will be the people who successfully bootstrap from the bottom and build the network from the bottom up. The tech isn't quite there yet, though, but getting close.<p>So, I'd actually say it isn't even that ""extensions"" need to interface with the system, it is the system that will eventually be interfacing with the ""extensions"". The flexible robots have to come first, <i>then</i> we will build the tube network. Until those robots exist the tube network economics just make no sense, not even in a dense city.",1291654997

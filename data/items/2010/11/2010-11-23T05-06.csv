</code></pre>
This is a bit of a strawman. You're basically saying that if you can find any fault with someone that is vegan, then their entire message is null and void. Think about it. You've stated that vegans aren't perfect because while eliminating one 'bad' thing from their diet they are forgetting a completely different one. That's your argument.<p>You're also only commenting on the effects to humans, while ignoring the effects to animals (which is an important factor for some/most vegans).<p>In general though, if you want to blame something, blame capitalism, and a lack of care for proper nutrition by the general public. Capitalism drives food companies to become ever more industrialized, and do whatever necessary to increase profits (fiddle with the sodium-fat-sugar content of their products to attempt to make people feel the <i>need</i> to eat more, and never feel that they have satisfied their hunger). The consumer can combat this with their pocket book, but the consumer just doesn't seem to care.",1290491591

</code></pre>
Not necessarily. I know a number of vegans that don't necessarily eat that healthy.<p>The thing that irks me is when vegans proclaim that the 'vegan diet' will make everyone healthier, cure obesity, etc. There are plenty of unhealthy foods that are perfectly vegan. I say this as a vegan myself. I see these people as 'hurting the movement' because they are spreading un-truths, even if they are well-intentioned (and the messengers believe the false message).<p>[Edit]
Don't take this as a claim that the 'vegan diet' (I use quotes because it is such as broad term) is necessarily unhealthy. It's just that there are many foods that are completely vegan, yet unhealthy:<p><pre><code>  - Skittles (since they removed gelatin as an ingredient)
  - Oreos
  - Sugar
  - Soda
  - A lot of potato chip varieties
  - Transfats (i.e. burned oils)
</code></pre>
(note: That I can only confirm things like Skittles or Oreos in the US. I know that in different countries the formulas are different. Skittles may still have gelatin in Canada, for example)

There are real specs for Python and Java for instance. The only real spec for Ruby is still crufty Yacc code for MRI.<p>A test suit doesn't do that and the whole Rubyspec thing is a testimony to people drinking too much of the Test Driven Development Cool Aid. TDD may be fine for some things but some formal design is needed for things like the creation of interpreters.<p>Part of the challenge is that MRI has such a fluid syntax that specifying it conventionally would be quite hard.

It puts pressure on restaurants to offer alternatives to meat, so we're not all forced to eat it because it's the only healthy option.  It pushes our culture to give people a choice.  Honestly, all I really want as a vegan is for people to have a good choice every day, at each meal, about how much/what kind of animal products they consume.  Right now in most places there just aren't choices, because 99% of people have a ""well, I'll just keep eating what I always have"" mentality.<p>Also, opting out of meat does get me into conversations regularly about the meat industry.  The fact that I only eat very specific kinds of meat in specific occasions opens up conversations with other people about when and why they eat meat.  I don't care if people eat meat on purpose, for their own reasons, but I do care that they wolf down pounds of it every day for no particular reason because it's what's put in front of us.  My opting out creates a context for other people to consider opting out.<p>And given that's my motivation, I'm pretty careful about how I engage people. I don't shame people, I don't push them.  I honestly don't give a shit what they decide.  I just like having the options all out there.<p>Note: I consider myself vegan.  I eat meat and dairy sometimes.  I eat vegetables, and vegetables are grown with animal products.  Meat and dairy are not the basis of my diet.  I eat a plant-based diet, so I consider myself vegan.  You can call this ""reform vegan"" to the ""orthodox"" if you like.  But anyone who's really looked at the realities of the situation (including the OP) comes to understand that there is no such thing as 100% vegan, and that what matters most is the health of the whole ecology.",1290489464

I'd say there has been <i>some</i> change in the industry, driven by people who have  opted out of meat entirely.<p>Even if you're skeptical about just how much change any one person can effect I fail to see how one might go about changing an industry while not at the same time demonstrating commitment to the ideals feeding that desire for change.<p>""Meanwhile, as vegans focus on the elimination of meat from our diets, they practically ignore the industrialized food that wreaks direct reproducible havoc on our metabolisms causing epidemic obesity and diabetes""<p>Really?

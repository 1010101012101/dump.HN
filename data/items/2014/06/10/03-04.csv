7871768,comment,7871458,7871668,8,0,Balgair,,,"I&#x27;m on the Westside and add some more anecdotes:<p><i>A friend&#x27;s wife is a master seamstress. She did all the costumes Ender&#x27;s Game with 3 other people (I bellieve). Being in the union means you get at least 1 gig a year. Another poster here talked about Hollywood being the dominant driver, and that is completely true. Many of the small engineering firms here (not Boeing, etc) are focused on cameras and other movie tech. Heck, most of the investment community here is in movies. Part of that driver means that the culture comes along with it. That means failure is not tolerated here.<p></i>My buddy just graduated UCLA dentistry. Its a 4 year program. He likes to study in coffee shops. He said when he first got to LA, the shop were half full of people trying to pitch a script or movie idea. Now? He said half the people here are CEOs of some sort.<p><i>Last year they had a mixer for Silicon Beach people at a bar in Santa Monica. I went, as I can at least code my way out of a paper bag, though not much more. Ok, chit chat, free beer, appetizers, etc. Then you realize that you and 2 other guys are the only engineers there. The other 50 people are all CEOs of some baby start-up or another, half with NDAs in the pockets. I talked to about 15 and not one of them knew to code, wanted me to work, and were looking to give out ~10% of the company for the work. No thanks.<p></i>Went to a thing for UCLA grads centered on start-ups. It was a panel discussion with UCLA alumni and then a meet and greet. Good cookies though. I asked the question: What is your work-life balance like. All laughed. One of the guys said his boss was a good example: 5-7am workout, 7-8am kids to school, 8-5pm work, 5-9pm play with kids, dinner, HW, 9-1am email, repeat. I pointed out that meant he slept 4 hours at that rate and, though he may be able to sustain this, it&#x27;s statistically impossible other people can.<p><i>Buddy got an interview for a coding job around the corner from Snapchat. Nice loft, great looking secretaries, good free lunch, etc. Problem was, he couldn&#x27;t figure out what they actually did as a business. He figured they were just looking for acqui-hire, something he was not interested in due to the stink of failure Hollywood fears.<p></i>Traffic sucks. I grow plants on the balcony. About every week I need to spritz them down from the exhaust ash that accumulates on the leaves. Not really about tech, I know, but still, I can see just how much of a car culture LA is on my carrots.<p>* We pay 12 for a nice little 2 bedroom. It&#x27;s a steal. The westside is really going up in costs now. I talked to the apartment manager and she says when we move they&#x27;ll rent for 17. The 2 new buildings going in cat-corner to us are 3k for their 1 bedrooms. LA may be cheap now, but the westside is going to SF levels soon. My lawyer friend in Los Feliz is going long on Compton. Rents are cheap there and it&#x27;s 3 miles from the beach, just like the westside used to be and Venice is now. Hes got 3 units already.",1402372569

7871754,comment,7868968,7868968,1,0,jroseattle,,,"There is some discussion about the validity of non-compete agreements in Washington state at the moment. I&#x27;m completely on the side of eliminating non-compete agreements, but as with everything there are always scenarios where it&#x27;s not so clear.<p>Case in point: when Kai Fu Lee left Microsoft for Google, Microsoft sued Google and Lee to enforce their non-compete. It took a bit to sort things out, some injunctions and whatnot, and they eventually settled out of court. By hiring Lee, Google was able to establish presence in China. When Microsoft originally hired Lee, he moved to China and established their (MSFT) research division in Beijing. Presumably, Microsoft had to invest resources to learn how to do business in that part of the world and for Lee to learn what was necessary to succeed.<p>Did Microsoft have a claim to say that what Lee learned in China during his employment with them was a competitive advantage? Certainly, but Lee <i>also</i> could lay claim to those skills as well (after all, it was he who had to learn them.) He had a reasonable expectation to be able to move to another company, but Microsoft likely should have a reasonable expectation to protect their investment in learning how to procure and develop that market as well.<p>In some scenarios, I can appreciate arguments from both sides.<p>Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee#Move_from_Microsoft_to_Google"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee#Move_from_Microsoft...</a>",1402372068

7871735,comment,7871690,7871690,1,0,bemmu,,,"Train ticket machines<p>- You really can insert a ticket in any orientation. Rotated, flipped. The machine turns the ticket around inside of it. If you get really into it, there&#x27;s an episode of a television series called &quot;Project X&quot; which has an entire episode about the design of the machine (sadly I think this only exists in Japanese).<p>- Accepting multiple coins in a vending machine simultaneously is cool, but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as describing it as &quot;as fast as you can throw them&quot;. Still even being able to put more than one it at a time is a huge improvement.<p>- A person really pops up from inside the machine if you need assistance. I was startled when it happened to me though :)<p>Ticket gates<p>- While it&#x27;s cool that the gates remain open unless a wrong ticket is inserted, it makes it more startling when you do insert a wrong ticket. Now you don&#x27;t know whether you have sinned until you almost walk into the gates that suddenly stop you.<p>- About honesty. Yeah, I think the machine would work just fine without even having real gates, as 99% would pay anyway. In local buses the drivers don&#x27;t bother to actually count your payment and just assume it&#x27;s right.<p>Toilet controls<p>- Japan has not gone too far. Once you get over your initial hesitation and get used to these, you can&#x27;t go back. Now not having one seems like a silly waste of paper. Google has these.<p>- Way too many buttons? Yeah, the flush button placing not being standardised sucks. Sometimes you wave your hand in front of the toilet to flush it, sometimes there is a digital button. But 99% of the time there is a physical lever too.<p>Restaurant ticket machines<p>- Having pictures is awesome, as it can be kind of hard to picture exactly what you get by just text even in your own native language if you are not familiar with a dish. Not having to use staff time to count money just makes sense, although creates a stingier feeling, so this probably wouldn&#x27;t work anywhere where you might want to bring a date. But efficient transactions make me happy.<p>Fax machines<p>- Sometimes when I order things for Candy Japan, the manufacturers still seem to prefer receiving their order by fax and might just ignore email.<p>ATMs<p>- Japanese transfers suck. You need to enter amount, bank name, bank branch name and account code. Why the bank name and branch name cannot be just encoded in the account code is bizarre. You have to know the readings to kanji for bank / branch name to be able to make the correct selection or separately enter a code for them, which you don&#x27;t always know.<p>- You enter a bank book and it actually physically flips the pages of it and writes things on it with a dot matrix printer inside the ATM. Again kind of bizarre and I&#x27;m amazed it works.<p>- Sometimes there can be four different vendor&#x27;s ATMs right next to each other in a row instead of one machine that could be used for all.<p>- You can deposit money, which I guess is kind of cool if you get a lot of cash payments. But I think it would be better solved by not having people receive cash in the first place by promoting use of cards in transactions.",1402371680

Obviously NSA finds this useful too, but even if we assume NSA had an industrial espionage program as advanced as China&#x27;s, what does China have for the U.S. to steal, relative to what the U.S. has for China? This question repeats itself for every other country in the West.<p>- Attribution of cyberattacks is difficult, which adds to the deniability aspect. If literally all that China has to worry about is a loss of face, then they can proverbially cry all the way to the bank. No one is going to be nuking or invading China for an over-active spy program.<p>- Because of the economic ties you mention, it is difficult for victim nations to take effective deterrence measures to convince China to change their behavior, since many measures that might cause China to feel a pinch would hurt the parties imposing sanctions just as much.<p>Moreover, &quot;eye for an eye&quot; is taken off the table by the asymmetric nature of the threat, and passive defense is taken away by the interconnected nature of the Internet. Sure, the U.S. and its critical industries can do better as far as defense, but so far it&#x27;s been a case of &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot;.<p>So looking at the situation from China&#x27;s perspective, you&#x27;d almost have to ask why they would ever stop. Western norms and morals are not necessarily their norms and morals and in any event the deterrence/coercion framework is simply not there.

The reality is it is overwhelmingly industrial espionage.  Countries behind the curve want to catch up to the industrial power on the bleeding edge.  Even the atomic espionage in the 1940s, which was more military, followed this same pattern of wanting to keep up with the US.<p>One reason I take all this with a grain of salt is Chinese espionage is a little more subtle than western espionage.  In the US/USSR spy vs. spy there were dead drops, honey traps, microfilm and all of that.  In some ways Chinese espionage hasn&#x27;t changed much in thousands of years.  They get a tiny bit of information from a wide variety of different sources.  Then they take all the information and put it together.

But I think there&#x27;s another aspect that I think the OP overlooked:<p>The dominant industry here will always be Hollywood, where the price of failure can be literally devastating.  If your startup fails in the Bay Area, it&#x27;s not too hard to become a line engineer at another company.  If your hedge fund fails in NYC, it&#x27;s not too hard to get another job at another fund, PE firm, or commercial bank.  In some cases, these &quot;failures&quot; are looked at as badges of honor, and likely gave you a lot of hands-on experience you can directly apply to your next job.<p>But if you fail in Hollywood, you&#x27;re looking at however many years lost of your life, when you were making no appreciable money as a bartender or barista, with likely no applicable skills to any other industry.  I found it amusing the OP described LA rent as affordable -- which by NYC or SF prices, it definitely is! -- yet LA also has the worst income/rent ratio of any city in the US, by far[0].  This is not due to rent being too high, but due to income being too low, because everyone here is broke while they&#x27;re trying to write screenplays and go on auditions.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to live here without having friends involved in the entertainment industry, so in other words, it&#x27;s really hard not to see this up close.  And even if your friends work on the production or post-production side, it&#x27;s not much better.  At least you have a steady salary, but you&#x27;re probably also working for a huge megacorp studio that literally embodies every single Office Space cliche.  Or you&#x27;re working for a production or post-production vendor that has to jump through ridiculous hoops and work ridiculous hours to get business from said studios.  And while that steady salary is nice, it&#x27;s still not nearly enough if you want to ever actually do own property some day.<p>So, I wonder how much of that also tempers the goals and dreams for LA startup entrepreneurs.

Why would I vouch for / share something that I had not read myself? Accumulate magic internet points? I hope my interpretation is wrong because it sounds like a product that supports and tacitly condones shallow, insincere, attention seeking behavior on the internet.  I realize that sounds harsh but I am really perplexed by the use  of &quot;recommend content to share&quot; versus &quot;recommend content to personally consume.&quot; It seems that in order to make good decisions about what to share the site would not only need information about me but also information about my social graph.<p>More than anything it sounds like a wonderful tool for astroturfing campaigns. Corporate PR departments would love to re-brand advertising as &quot;AI based merit recommendations.&quot;",1402369675

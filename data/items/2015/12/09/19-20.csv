Writing words is like writing code: some people are paid to do it, and some do it for fun. Both professionals and hobbyists can create good or bad writing, and they have to be judged case by case.<p>Like math or woodcarving, writing is a skill which on the most basic level accomplishes a workaday task, and with more sophistication may produce beauty. Maybe all arts are on that spectrum, which starts with necessity and ends with aesthetics.<p>On the professional side: Writing is commercialized for various purposes. Journalists are paid to convey facts; columnists perform acts of middle-brow cleverness; and novelists arrange words to produce emotions.<p>All of those products are substitutable goods. Radio, TV and the Internet have left the industries of the written word in ruins. Newspapers, publishing, you name it -- there are no barriers to entry any more. Writing has been largely commodified.<p>This has a lot of consequences. One is a decline in marketing budgets for new books. Unless a novel is sure to sell, and even then, a publishing house will offload the task of promoting the book to the writer. So half a writer&#x27;s life will be spent barnstorming from one book-signing to the next.<p>This is compounded by the networking they must do to land a book deal in the first place. Like startup founders, authors need to make something that people want, and then find a way to distribute it. Networking is all about solving the distribution problem, getting noticed. Nobody else will do it for you...",1449690514

Any criticism of the lack of generics has to take into account the arguments already made for its, as far as I know, deliberate omission.<p>Every so often people start grumbling about C. They call it a terrible language because the specification contains undefined behavior (and less frequently because they removed the linter from the compiler early on). These arguments are well known and have been addressed over several decades. Any complaint about undefined behavior has to account for the fact that said omissions are intentional and have been well-argued for by the ANSI committee and community of C compiler developers. If you can&#x27;t do that then you&#x27;re complaints are just going to fall on deaf ears: you haven&#x27;t contributed anything that we don&#x27;t already know.<p>If anyone wants to introduce generics into Go they&#x27;re going to have one hell of a debate on their hands. I believe the reasons against it are firmly established and it will never happen. I may be wrong but any argument for their inclusion has a lot of work to do.<p>This doesn&#x27;t make Go a bad language. It&#x27;s probably just not the right fit for your purposes if you really need generics. Such abstractions are not a universal property of languages. I get by fine in C without them... but I prefer C (or Common Lisp) because if I <i>did</i> want them there are good libraries to give me those features.<p>I don&#x27;t know when it became fashionable to have such opinionated languages but I tend to disagree with most of them so I just avoid them for the most part.",1449690261

This wasn&#x27;t a conspiracy theory; it was all done in the open. Consequences:<p>1) Even for whites happy to integrate: A few black families move in, credit dries up, nobody can sell or improve their homes, and your housing values plummet.<p>2) And even worse for blacks: Imagine trying to buy a house without credit. Now imagine doing that coming from the rock-bottom financial circumstances imposed on most blacks in the mid-20th century.<p>3) Blacks who did obtain homes couldn&#x27;t get home improvement loans, resulting in deterioration of their homes and a reputation among whites for not caring about their properties.<p>4) The effect on supply and demand: It forced a very large and growing number of black residents into a small, artificially limited number of rentals (they could only live in certain neighorhoods, remember), driving up rental rates and driving down the quality of their residences (landlords could fill their properties without doing maintenance). Even more perversely, even if someone would sell them a house, blacks had to pay more than whites <i>for the same house</i> - the black bidder had far fewer options. Again, remember the people in the worst financial circumstances were the ones facing these problems.<p>Back then bankers said the same thing: They are bad credit risks.<p>----<p>[1] The Origins of the Urban Crisis:Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit by Thomas J.

Here are some chess players speaking about Go:<p><i>&quot;While the Baroque rules of chess could only have been created by humans, the rules of go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical that if intelligent life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play go.&quot;</i> -- Edward Lasker, chess grandmaster<p><i>&quot;Chess has only two outcomes: draw and checkmate. The objective of the game . . . is total victory or defeat – and the battle is conducted head-on, in the center of the board. The aim of go is relative advantage; the game is played all over the board, and the objective is to increase one&#x27;s options and reduce those of the adversary. The goal is less victory than persistent strategic progress.&quot;</i> -- Dr. Henry Kissinger, quoted in Newsweek, 11/8/04<p><i>&quot;What&#x27;s happening with chess is that it&#x27;s gradually losing its place as the par excellence of intellectual activity.

I agree that sometimes a very high return seems unfair/unwarranted (again, true of speculation in general).<p>2) Many people holding a lot of bitcoin (e.g. the Winklevii) are working very hard towards bitcoin&#x27;s success.  They believe in the technology.  If that turns them into billionaires, I don&#x27;t see that as any more unreasonable than Facebook billionaires.  Aside from those who are working hard, with any technology/startup there are usually some &quot;passive&quot; investors that hit pay dirt.  Would you cap Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s upside since there must have been some people invested in, or employed by, Facebook that really didn&#x27;t do anything, yet made quite a bit of money?  Who&#x27;s going to decide what&#x27;s reasonable?<p>3) Let the market decide.  There are competing alternatives, let&#x27;s see what happens.  If enough people are outraged by the thought of a few bitcoin speculators making billions, then perhaps that could kill it.

10706021,comment,10698478,10704629,0,0,amyjess,,,"> A good example of what you&#x27;re talking about is a wife quitting her job and staying home with the kids, even though she knows that it would make her miserable.<p>> To you, that&#x27;s a curtailment of ambition, compromise, and selflessness. To me, that&#x27;s the beginning of the end. She will make herself miserable and then, she will make everyone else miserable around her.<p>Adding to this, I&#x27;m transgender, and my experiences with talking to other members of the trans community line up with this perfectly.<p>A lot of trans people are in similar situations. A good many of us don&#x27;t realize it until later in life -- or if we <i>do</i> realize it earlier, we run headfirst into denial and don&#x27;t accept it until later in life. As such, many trans people are already married when they accept being trans. Sadly, one of the most common responses to this acceptance is to say &quot;well, I&#x27;m already married and my spouse is straight, so I&#x27;ll just keep it a secret and resign myself to living with the dysphoria and never transitioning&quot;. Or they <i>do</i> try to come out, but their spouse reacts poorly, so they back up and lie through their teeth, saying &quot;sorry, it was just a phase, it&#x27;s passed now&quot;, and they go right back in the closet.<p>It doesn&#x27;t work. Ever. What happens is that a) the dysphoria not only doesn&#x27;t go away but often gets <i>worse</i>, and b) they come to resent their spouse for keeping them in the closet and preventing them from transitioning. So their marriage completely deteriorates over time, and they wind up coming out and transitioning years afterwards <i>anyway</i>. That&#x27;s a good way to guarantee not just a divorce but a very bitter, resentful divorce that will guarantee no chance of them even remaining friends afterwards. Expect lots of recriminations of &quot;What do you mean you&#x27;ve been keeping this secret from me all these years?&quot; vs. &quot;I sacrificed everything to make <i>you</i> happy!&quot;. Both parties will ultimately walk away from the marriage knowing that they wasted years, if not decades, of their lives.<p>And this is why the trans community has such a high suicide rate (well, half of it: the other half is that the people who <i>did</i> know young often have parents who are unsupportive to the point of abusiveness).<p>If they refused to sublimate their ambitions and make themselves miserable for their spouse&#x27;s sake, things would have never gotten that bad. Maybe they&#x27;d somehow stay together after transition, or maybe they&#x27;d realize their goals are incompatible and amicably split up before they could waste too much time in an unhappy situation.",1449688758

They have kept revenue/cash flow going/improving over that same period by putting more and more ads on their properties, dumping things which aren&#x27;t making money, and trying really hard to push many of the moonshot projects into profitability. During the same 6 years Microsoft has been reporting growing margins on its search advertising business and Bing became profitable for the first time not too long ago.<p>The issue for Google is that while their search is good, Microsoft has crossed over into the &quot;good enough&quot; space (for the customers, advertisers) and the product (people using the service) are less and less likely to force switch the search engine default to Google. Worse, the back stop efforts that Google has been doing to protect revenue growth have caused many long time users to become dissatisfied with their user experience. Google&#x27;s portal portfolio (News, Finance, G+, Pictures, and Blogger) and cloud offering (GCE) have not kept up with other offerings in the space they are losing share.<p>All of that summarizes to &quot;web services are becoming commodities&quot; and while profitable (as Bing has demonstrated) it&#x27;s not going to continue to be profitable enough for Google to do that and any of the other projects that 90% of the other employees work on.<p>So first Google will start reporting down quarters because no matter how many ads they cram on a page it doesn&#x27;t improve their RPM, then start cutting projects internally left and right to cut costs, and then they start cutting more of the benefits, and then they start downsizing groups to stay within the &#x27;profitable&#x27; envelope, and like a main sequence star that has run out of hydrogen to burn, the collapse to white dwarf has begun. What Alphabet does at that point will be interesting, but their margins on the G business will only be sufficient to support the G business and not anything else. If they aren&#x27;t making any money elsewhere then poof.<p>So when? Can&#x27;t say, really it depends on them being able to pull out into a sustainable business model on the lower margins of commoditized search. Google seems to understand the threat to the business (given their moves, like Alphabet, changing CFOs Etc.). And they are really smart so if there is a way out they may be able to find it, and they have enough cash to &quot;coast&quot; for a long time (look how long Yahoo has coasted right?) But a lot of these things end up being additive, the shine goes off of working there, a lot of solid people leave and then you can lose the ability to change fast enough to avoid your fate.<p>Companies that pull it off (re-inventing themselves) are much rarer than companies that auger into the ground.",1449688531

Don&#x27;t get me wrong here: I&#x27;m not saying that you can&#x27;t say anything significant when you&#x27;re a student; what I mean here is that one needs to come up with more detailed explanations and with many more examples which are valid for a wide range of scenarios and use-cases when you make a general statement about a programming language which has been created by some of the highly-respected experts in the field of programming language. The list of problems mentioned in the article are important but they&#x27;re not very critical for the kind of the system development that Go language has been designed/developed for[2].<p>Since Go language has been developed for system programming, the term &#x27;system programming&#x27; is not restricted to embedded system only (as few people have already mentioned it in different threads here) which are mostly limited to one component (or small number of related components working together). With the advent of internet and IoT, we are forced to develop very large software systems (read, software systems as infrastructures) in order to make next generation of internet and IoT applications possible and usable (talking from business perspective). Development of these new large scale systems bring different kinds of theoretical and practical problems like complexity, concurrency and inefficiencies in system development process (for example; code compilation of large codebase and running regression test suits). And, Go has been specifically build for this new kind of large scale system softwares[2] (competing/working along with some other programming languages in this area).<p>Here, I would read the initial set of high-level problems which forced Rob Pike and his team to create a whole new language[2], instead of <i>only</i> considering issues/problems which one face while developing a single machine software/hardware program (as I&#x27;ve already said that they&#x27;re important but they&#x27;re also not everything). Once I know the strength and weakness of a programming language, I know when I should (or should not) use it, under what circumstances it&#x27;s the right tool and what advantages/dis-advantages I&#x27;ve to trade off when I use it.<p>---<p>[1]- <a href=""http://yager.io/resume.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yager.io/resume.pdf</a><p>[2]- <a href=""http://commandcenter.blogspot.de/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commandcenter.blogspot.de/2012/06/less-is-exponential...</a>",1449688145

You run data services that output JSON, then the JS on the page calls those data services and renders the views.<p>This still allows you to reap the benefits of static content (namely CDN distribution / caching) while still maintaining some dynamic content.<p>But basically, you do it this way to avoid pulling data that isn&#x27;t user-specific from the database. It&#x27;s far more efficient to build a header + page + footer once at build time than to have every client have to do that on access -- even if you have 100+ variations of your site that need to be compiled and updated on any change in the shared content. Storage and compute resource are trivially cheap if they don&#x27;t scale exponentially with number of users.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s more work for your developers, but it saves your DBAs a LOT of work by reducing the volume of data served from the database. And at the end of the day, it&#x27;s full-stack effort that counts -- I&#x27;d rather have my developers spend 2x the time to build a system than have my DBAs fighting fires because the site went down. With a static site, you can set it to read-only mode if the traffic gets to be too much, and the static content will be handled by the CDN (which can almost certainly handle any load).",1449687922

Our plan is to open story reviewing to the entire community, but there are some design challenges to solve first. I like the idea of making it a new way of earning karma, because it&#x27;s both work and community service.<p>Re criteria for filtering stories: karma isn&#x27;t a factor; past submissions are. A downside of the latter might be a rich-get-richer effect, but we mitigate that by looking for any earlier submission of the same story and picking that one instead. We don&#x27;t advise about timing; in fact, we randomize the process to reduce timing effects.<p>We mostly don&#x27;t send repost invites anymore, but rather re-up the original post by rolling back its internal clock and giving it a random placement near the bottom of the front page. This guarantees a few minutes of community exposure, and regular upvoting decides the rest. On the front page, we display the re-upped timestamp, not the original timestamp, because otherwise it&#x27;s confusing—only the re-upped time makes sense relative to the other stories on the page. But the original timestamp is available on most of the other pages that list the story, like /submitted and /from, and the discrepancy is temporary, since eventually the two timestamps converge.<p>The reason we switched from reposts to re-ups is that HN users are averse to duplication. I trust that the programmers among them hold their code to the same standard. We do still send emails when it seems important for the submitter to know that their story may still make the front page—mostly for Show HNs, like this one.<p>All of this is the latest in a series of experiments we&#x27;ve been running, whose goal is to fix the problem of good stories falling through the cracks on HN.

Dose matters.<p>Let me illustrate what I mean:<p>> <i>&quot;The estimated lower limit of a lethal dose of nicotine has been reported as between 500 and 1000 mg.&quot;</i><p>The highest commercially-available concentration of nicotine in ready-to-vape e-juice is 36mg nic/ml. This is considered extremely high nic, and is rarely purchased anymore. So, if you drank 14-28ml of this juice straight from the bottle, that might be a lethal dose (typical bottles are 15-30ml). I can think of several substances you likely have in your house today that have similar levels of toxicity.<p>My e-cig is loaded with 1.5mg/ml or 0mg/ml juice depending. I vape ~3ml/hour at full-bore. If I absorb only 50% of the vaporized nic, I am releasing 2.25mg of nic into the air over an hour. At 2 puffs per minute that&#x27;s 0.02mg per puff, distributed over the volume of the vapor cloud.<p>If you walk through my vapor cloud on a sidewalk, your nic exposure is truly insignificant.<p>I -- and all friends I have who also vape -- make it a point to not subject others to our habit, out of simple human decency.

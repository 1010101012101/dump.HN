Merely disagreeing with my congressperson is not enough for me to withdraw my vote, because it's a given that I will disagree with them on various points. If they are a reasonable person, I will generally weigh the number of things we agree and disagree on. If they are not willing to listen to reason, my support is out the window immediately.<p>Anyway, I think despite the fact that it's likely that those who support it now will vote for it, it's perhaps too early to make a decision on voting or not voting for a given person based on this bill alone.",1324068583

What if that response is a Date object? What if that Date object was extended with additional functionality? What if that Date object stored additional values in unexpected places? A huge advantage of Javascript is that everything is an object and everything can be modified.<p>When you try to make that work, you'll start placing restrictions on what can and what can't be passed. Global scope will be a nightmare. You'll try to hack together a scheme that casts responses into primitives. In the end, you'll end up with a stifling environment where interoperabilty is a theory that is never used in production because it was crippled to make it functional to the point of being useless.",1324068545

You can increment the counter correctly, but you can't start encrypting from within a partial block.<p>Lets say you need to encrypt 17 bytes and write them to a file, which later can be opened in append mode to append more data to it using AES-128/CTR-BE mode:<p><pre><code>  1234567890ABCDEF\0
</code></pre>
C-style terminated string.<p>That is 2 blocks in CTR mode (1 full block used, 1 partial block (1 byte out of a 16 byte block)).<p>The next time you open the file you want to append data to it, what you would do is this:<p><pre><code>  1. Load your previous key, and counter into AES-128/CTR
  2. Increment the counter by the full blocks already used
  3. Update the location into the current block by encrypting a random byte
  4. Provide the rest of your plaintext which will now be correctly encrypted for appending to an already encrypted segment
</code></pre>
Now you can read your file back using the following:<p><pre><code>  1. the AES key, counter for the start of the file
  2. Use CTR to ""decrypt"" the content from start to finish
</code></pre>
So that would look something like this in Java code with JCE:<p><pre><code>  Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CTR/NoPadding"");
  SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(aeskey, ""AES"");
  IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(iv);
  c.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keySpec, ivSpec);
</code></pre>
I've left out some stuff like creating the iv (really the counter), so now if we wanted to advance into the first block what we could do (and this works with JCE) is this:<p><pre><code>  c.update(new byte[count]);
</code></pre>
Where count contains the amount we want to offset into the next block.<p>On JCE this does exactly what I described above, it moves forward ""count"" characters into the next block and then you can do:<p><pre><code>  CipherOutputStream cipher_out = new CipherOutputStream(output, c);
</code></pre>
where ""output"" is DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""filename"", true)) which is a file opened in append mode. Now you can write stuff to the file using the normal functions used by an OutputStream. This will then correctly append your new data to the end of the file so that if you start reading at the beginning of the file you can read through the end and get valid data. (We are using this to encrypt log files that are opened in Append only mode).<p>Where BouncyCastle breaks down is that you can not use c.update() to move forward into the block, thus appending is not possible because if you don't end on a block boundary your next write is going to have overlap. The only thing you can do in c.update() is provide it the amount of bytes that is the same as the block size. So you have to pad all input into c.update() to 16 bytes. Basically instead of being a stream cipher that allows seeking it has become yet another block cipher.",1324068073

I say, let your users kick the tires without any barriers. If you're really solving a need, people will give you their money.<p>- Which brings me to my next point... what does your product do?

3362198,comment,3361212,3361212,2,0,lix2333,,,"I think it isn't considered a success for many reasons.<p>First, there was no excitement generated by the stock. What I mean by this is, no one was willing to pony up and pay a premium to their offering price. This has to do less with the academic approach and more with what actually happens  when you help a company do their IPO. Usually when an investment bank helps a 'hot' company do their IPO, they under price it a little bit on purpose. That way, when it goes to market, the stock jumps 20-50% and the company looks good, and everything thinks it's a bluechip company. If you come out flat or your stock depreciates on the first day, it's usually a sign that the market isn't bullish on your company.<p>This is especially true for tech stocks because they're supposed to be new and sexy. If an industrial company does their IPO and their stock is about even for the day, it doesn't raise many eyebrows. But if a stock that's supposed to jump 20% stays flat, you can see what the market is feeling about the stock.<p>The second reason why its considered a failure is due to how fast the valuation of the company fell. I think a few months or half a year ago, when Zygna first started talking about their IPO, people were really excited about it. Initial valuations were something like $15 Billion. In the past few weeks, they've had to continually lower what their offer price was going to be because they realized that people were a bit bearish on their stock. So instead of a $15B valuation, their company is now worth about $7B. Or rather, Wall Street thinks their company is worth $7B.<p>Finally, I think the timing was off for them. I think people are pretty cautious about whether or not this whole internet company thing is going to be another bubble. People started talking about the bubble when Facebook had their $50B valuation from Goldman, but nothing really changed until LinkedIn's stock plummeted recently. This made investors even more wary. Then came the news that Zynga lost a ridiculous number of users in a month (can't remember the number but it was something like 200k I think).<p>All those things combined made this IPO a failure by MARKET standards.<p>I still think this is a win for the owners.

This wasn't due to the suitability of HTML for the task, but rather, due to the lack of any other reasonable standardized competing platform.<p>HTML has fallen over in this context; the DOM is ill-suited towards standard re-usable UI widget programming, JS is frustrating for building large applications, the performance profile is tremendously bad on mobile devices. This has led companies like Google to task teams with exploring how to fix HTML to be more amenable to application development -- whether it be dart, replacing the DOM, NaCL, or otherwise.*<p>> <i>Also consider that there have already been two freely targetable VM plugins which have had near total market penetration at various points in the web's history.

The segmentation between hardcovers and paperbacks is natural in the format: once the hardcovers sell out, and nobody's willing to pay hardcover prices any more, you need to make a cheaper edition, so you make paperbacks, which require you to spend effort on laying out the book again.  With ebooks, once you generate the initial edition, there's no inherent need to invest in the book ever again.  Once it stops selling at $20, you just cut the price.<p>To yield segmentation like this, there'd have to be a strong economic incentive, or else a <i>cheap</i> way of generating the multiple editions.

I work at a small startup doing gov't work and we develop Android applications that talk to massive server based backends. Yay cloud!<p>On 2.2 we were seeing issues with the GC not firing enough, especially after shutting down a thread and no longer requiring the data allocated therein and thus we would run out of memory (heap size being set to 24 MB), on our 2.3 devices we were not seeing that issue because 1, the heap size was set to 32 MB, but 2, because our app used much less memory, from what we could see when a thread went away the GC properly cleaned up the memory associated with it, not only that but the same functionality had a difference of almost 5 MB of heap size. The 2.3 VM was more efficient compared to the 2.2 VM.<p>We have also found many issues with BouncyCastle, the default Android encryption/decryption library that we couldn't reproduce with Java JCE, we filed bugs with BouncyCastle and they said they were features/that we were using it wrong/that they wouldn't fix it. We ended up writing our own CTR block mode (no, we didn't rewrite AES) to fix one of the many issues we found with BouncyCastle.<p>Also, the SQLite version on the 2.x line of Android OS allows certain constructs that are technically not legal in the versions it claims to be but it accepts and ignores that bad input. The developer had taken output from MySQL workbench and put it in as SQL directly into the SQLite stuff on Android no realising some of his stuff was being ignored because it wasn't valid, no errors were thrown though. As soon as we ran our APK on an Android 3.0 tablet the app would crash because the SQLite there DOES throw errors. Yes it was a simple fix, but it shouldn't have been allowed in the first place!<p>We also found a whole range of issues with various different keyboards that you can download from the market. Some were causing our app to crash, others would cause the text entry field to show random characters yet when reading back the text from the field in code just the user inputted stuff was there. We'd have our software designed to have a button in a certain location but with certain keyboards up the button was no longer a clickable target and you had to first exit the keyboard. Looking at our bug tracker keyboard related issues are HUGE and there are plenty. It is even worse because the same keyboard on one device may work just fine but move to another device from a different manufacturer and it may be completely broken making it hard to verify bugs do exist.<p>We now have almost 20 test devices that we have to manually test our software on to make sure it looks right, that nothing is overlapping, and that it works correctly. Designing for multiple different sizes of screen, and then for landscape mode on those screens is absolutely horrible. On some screens elements get so stretched in landscape it just looks terrible and on others everything is so squashed together in portrait mode that it makes it hard for the user to accurately hit a target.<p>Fragmentation is driving me personally insane.

The student wins, and there is a paradox.<p>The definition of the paradox thus shifts from something vague about 'sure' to something concrete: a bet that has 100% chance of being paid off, made with this intention.<p>Now, you are saying that student argues thusly.  If the teacher is making a guarantee that I will be given no sure-bet (bet at 100% chance to win that the test is on that day), then that is a guarantee that I will not be in a position to place that bet on Friday.<p>This is true.<p>What is false is the step: ""THEREFORE, if on Friday...""

It doesn't matter what the second half of the sentence is.<p>Now.<p>Perhaps the first statement (1) is similar.

Reasoning ""If it falls on six"" is no better than reasoning ""If it falls on 7"" UNLESS you have been given some guarantee that there is a nonzero chance it falls on a six!!!<p>The whole ""paradox"" hinges on people thinking that by saying ""the test will be given on a monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, or friday"" means that none of these days has the same probability as ""the test is not given at all.""  But in fact, one or more of these days could have that exact same probability: 0.0.<p>When it's 0.0 due to the stochastic process involved, ""reasoning"" with it is no better than ""reasoning with"" the case that the test isn't given at all.<p>You can see all this very easily with the pseudocode.<p>If the students are not given any guarantee that there is a non-zero chance the test is given on Friday or on Thursday, it is a mistake to reason anything at all about Friday or Thursday.<p>Here is the logical fallacy.<p>You assume that if there is probability 1 that the day is 1,2,3,4, or 5, then it follows that for each of 1,2,3,4,5 there is probability >0.0.  That's a mistake.  It's a fallacy.  You haven't really been told that.<p>We can invalidate all assertions of a paradox very easily with two parallel universes.<p>Suppose the teacher is a mad physicist.  He splits (forks) his universe in two, preceding as follows.<p>In one parallel universe the teacher always gives the test on Monday.<p>In another parallel universe the teacher always gives the test on Tuesday.<p>In both cases, the students are told: I guarantee you will be surprised by the test.  I guarantee that it will be given next week, and on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.<p>If the students DON'T KNOW about his mad experiment... how can they possibly be SURE of being tested (and being correct in this deduction) on either Monday or on Tuesday?  None of these students could possibly be sure on any of these days.<p>They are simply mistaken when they begin to argue: ""If we make it to Friday, the test must be Friday"".  This is no better than arguing ""If we are not tested at all, then the test must be Friday"".  Both of those are equally valid arguments.  They're both wrong in this scenario.<p>The scenario where they're NOT both wrong, where ""if we make it to Friday, the test must be Friday"" is OK (not violating the guarantee to have a test during the week) whereas ""if we are not tested at all, then the test must be Friday"" is not okay, is if the students know for a fact htat there isn't a 0.0 chance of having a test on a friday.<p>you simply can't deduce from something that is false.  THe student is (in the case of the scenario just outlined, where the test day is monday or tuesday) arguing from false premises when they say ""If we haven't had a test by Friday...""<p>That's an argument from a false premise (in this scenario) and is invalid for that reason.<p>The question is: are the students given enough information to know that the premise is NOT false (""if we make it to Friday"")?  If the teacher guarantees them a stochastic process with a nonzero chance of a test on Friday, then they have enough information to know that the premise is NOT false.<p>since htis is not stipulated, however, the teacher can meet his commitments.",1324065637

I think we all know that is not the case. Some would even go as far to say that tend to be more morally ambiguous relative to everyone else, purely as a function of the type of personality the profession attracts (although it might just be a matter of perspective or priority). There's a more than enough engineers in the long tail of people financially desperate, intellectually interested or simply pro-SOPA to build it.<p>And then let's not forget the miserably misguided geniuses who created a airborne H1N5 virus in the name of research.

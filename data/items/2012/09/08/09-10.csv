In this experimental paradigm a treatment is given in a routine manner (the open administration), where the psychosocial context surrounding treatment administration is present, and a hidden manner, where the treatment is given without the patient's knowledge. In the case of drug therapy, the open administration mimics normal clinical care, where the doctor injects a drug in full view of the patient with verbal and contextual interactions. In the hidden administration, the drug is infused by a computer pump in the absence of the clinician and the therapeutic context. Patients receiving hidden administration are aware that at some stage they will receive a drug but they do not experience the expectation component or other contextual factors surrounding the administration. Because the hidden administration removes the psychosocial context of treatment, this paradigm defines the placebo component as the difference between open and hidden administrations, although no placebo is given<p>The open-hidden paradigm has been used in several clinical settings.<p>In pain, hidden administrations of five commonly used painkillers (morphine, buprenorphine, tramadol, ketorolac, metamizol) have been demonstrated to be markedly less effective than open administrations.  ...""  ->  <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832199/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832199/</a>",1347096732

In the US, UK, and France, copyright is life + 70 years. Republishing your work, even with inserted statements on fascism, is a violation of copyright laws, so not permitted. Note that in the UK, moral rights only extend to the length of copyright law; in France it's forever.<p>Don't you think that 70 years is enough time for your original views to have gotten out? I mean, I could also take the works of Darwin and insert references to young earth creationism on every page, but I don't think it would change many people's minds about Darwin's works.<p>I suppose I could take an obscure biography written 100 years old and change it to discredit the original author. But what impact would it have? I could as easily write a completely fake story and attribute it to the original person, and get the same effect. Do you wish to also ban historical novels?<p>In Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp, the Supreme Court decision (8-0, btw) said:<p>> Reading ""origin"" in 43(a) to require attribution of uncopyrighted materials would pose serious practical problems. Without a copyrighted work as the basepoint, the word ""origin"" has no discernable limits. A video of the MGM film Carmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would presumably require attribution not just to MGM, but to Oscar Hammerstein II (who wrote the musical on which the film was based), to Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on which the musical was based), and to Prosper Mrime (who wrote the novel on which the opera was based). In many cases, figuring out who is in the line of ""origin"" would be no simple task.<p>It seems the same problems of attribution, and of defining the source of the material, would apply to any moral right which extends ""forever.""<p>Thus why I don't think your example helps clarify the reason for the particular moral right you mentioned.",1347096363

That strikes me as a fairly arrogant thing for the article to say, but regardless, two spaces doesn't work for me. It's just not enough indentation for my eyes.<p>In particular, I like to code in a proportional font. I find this more pleasant for reading code, just as I prefer proportional fonts for other text. Two spaces is <i>definitely</i> not enough in a proportional font. It's like a single space in a monospaced font.<p>But even when I switch to a monospaced font, I just don't enjoy reading code with two-space indentation.",1347095213

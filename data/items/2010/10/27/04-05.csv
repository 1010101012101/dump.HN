1837314,comment,1836799,1837001,0,0,brc,,,"Not with the lettuce, somehow.  I have a lot of trouble with caterpillars on my other vegies such as broccoli, but they don't seem to eat the lettuce much.  Maybe I'm just lucky.  I have some organic bug spray but I don't use it much, I find it easier to just go and squash any uninvited visitors, and it's good thinking time to spend 5 minutes a day just looking for bugs (har har).  I'm a rank amateur at growing - I experience tomato crop failures all the time.  But for hardy stuff like lettuce and (most) herbs, it's really quite simple and rewarding.<p>I'm quite lucky with my climate though, but for a lot of people in California they should be similarly blessed (I'm not in California).<p>One thing I didn't note was that you'll need to plant your seedlings about 3-4 weeks before you're ready to start harvesting.  But get it right and you should have an endless supply from about 6-10 plants, and you don't need much space for this.  Just choose lettuce that the whole plant doesn't need to be harvested - ie, not 'iceberg' lettuce.<p>edit : here's a pic of my first crop about 4 weeks after planting. It eventually grew to about 4 feet tall.  There's a couple of different varieties in here, I now only go for the ones like in the original article with a roundish leaf.<p><a href=""http://i54.tinypic.com/332p94k.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i54.tinypic.com/332p94k.jpg</a>",1288155397

The developers of twitter applications incorperated these into their applications, and eventually it became the standard, being adopted by Twitter.com themselves.<p>Since then Twitter has become a powerful method to distribute links to cool content. However, with the 160character limit, characters are a premium, so a whole bunch of services were born (bit.ly, goo.gl, etc.) to shorten URL's.<p>http://www.google.com.au/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=fluffy+bunnies (73 Characters or 45.63% of total tweet) became http://bit.ly/bRajwN (20 Characters or 12.5% of total tweet)  a massive saving in tweet length. Why not take it a step further?<p>Why not remove the need for the ""http://""? I mean do we really need to know that we are accessing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol? Google removed the http:// from Google Chrome back in April<p>By removing ""http://"" we will be saving seven characters from any tweet that has one link in it (or 4.38% of total tweet). TechCrunch recently reported that Twitter sees 90 million tweets per day with 25% containing links. That equates to 22.5 million links. All those links include ""http://"" that is 157.5million characters sent every day.<p>So if we remove it, how would my favorite Twitter software recognize a link? A new tag, hereby christened a linktag;<p>^<p>Why ^ ? Well  @ and # are already tags. Moving along the keyboard, we can't use $ or % as I assume they are used quite a bit. But ^ is rarely used in text. It also looks like the head of an arrow pointing up, like a link out of the page.<p>The link tag will replace the 'http://' (7 characters or 4.38% of tweet) with '^' (1 character or .63% of tweet), this will mean that 135 million characters will be removed from tweets every day.",1288152967

I'm glad that Sony is trying something different to get ahead of the curve as portable gaming converges with smartphones. There are several reasons, however, why I think this device may struggle in the market.<p>For instance, who is the target market? Kids and teen gamers who buy a PSP or DS (I assume parents often pay) or young adults that currently buy an Android phone or an iPhone?<p>If the target market is kids or teen gamers, will they be able to afford the price of the device plus the monthly voice/data plan? For instance, while 33% of teens aspire to own an iPhone, only 14% of teens actually own the device, down 1% from the prior year (Fortune, 2010); perhaps this decline was due to the recession or the emergence of Android phones.<p>For teens and young adults, will this device appeal to them as a replacement for an iPhone or for a different Android phone? The iPhone and select Android smart phones (e.g., Motorola Droid) have functional value, but also serve as a fashion statement. For many, the phone you choose is an extension of your identity (e.g., like your choice of car). How many teens and young adults will identify with a Sony PS phone with built in PS controls?<p>Perhaps Sony can overcome the cost of ownership issue by partnering with a discount cellular carrier, such as Virgin Mobile or Metro PCS. The second issue about the appeal of iPhones and select Android phones is more of a challenge. The device as pictured in the Engadget article looks interesting. But how many teens and young adults will shy away from the built in PS controls (and the bulk that this adds to the device)?<p>What are thoughts on how this device will perform in the smartphone market?",1288152273

So they wholesale at dirt cheap prices on a first-come first-served basis and people can then buy and sell them based on market value. Works for real estate so why not domains?<p>The problem derives from the initial price and the expectations that implants. Many expect a domain to cost $10. So when they are offered a price more than that, they are pissed off and blame the person selling it to them.<p>Nobody walks past a vacant block in a prime real estate location and goes ""bastards, if they weren't squatting that land, I could snap it up"". They know the land costs $x million and don't assume it should cost $10. However, because domains are a new real estate market and not every possible domain is out of wholesale, people base their expectation of price on the wholesale price.<p>Now, let's think of the alternative. Anyone who has tried to buy a top level domain for a country that heavily regulates the names would understand the pain of the alternative. It can cost hundreds or thousands for the wholesale price. You're required to own the trademark already (which adds additional cost for a new project) as well as have a registered company etc. I can think of dozens of my favourite projects/blogs which I'm sure don't have a company or trademark registered under that name. This system would not only be a pain for small business, it would stifle innovation on the web.<p>I'm not a domainer (I do own about a dozen though) and I get just as annoyed as the next guy when I come up with a name for a project and find some punk wants $15k for the domain.

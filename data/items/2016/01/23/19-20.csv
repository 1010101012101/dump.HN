But those transformations aren&#x27;t trivial in the general case: how about breaking out of multiple loops or returns out of the function from inside loops? At some point, the transformations that we&#x27;d have to do would get so complex they&#x27;d hinder the programmer&#x27;s mental model of what code will get generated. We&#x27;d also have to do a fair bit of work to make sure the optimizer can figure out what we&#x27;re encoding so as to not lose performance.",1453579172

10959795,comment,10959074,10959436,0,0,acdha,,,"> Taking care of my family involves me working hard, so why are you willing to make me work harder so that others can work less?<p>Because when you decide you&#x27;d like to launch a startup, you don&#x27;t want the failure mode to be “I lose my house and live out of my car”.<p>Because in a year when you or a family member develops a debilitating disease, you&#x27;d want there to be an option available which is better than “I go bankrupt and end up on the street”.<p>Because if you or a family member decides they want to switch careers, go back to school, etc. you&#x27;d like food, health care, etc. not to be a major source of stress unless you&#x27;re independently wealthy.<p>Because if you or a family member ends up in a bad relationship and needs to leave in a hurry, the answer isn&#x27;t hoping there&#x27;s room at a shelter because all of the landlords in town want a deposit or there&#x27;s a year delay getting the subsidized child-care needed to actually be able to get a job.<p>Most of the people in the United States who go bankrupt were willing to work hard and didn&#x27;t think that would happen to them. That went well until they had medical bills, a major employer left the area, etc. and they either couldn&#x27;t work or were unable to find a job. People like to say you should keep 6-12 months income in the bank, which is certainly great advice but even if you&#x27;re one of the relatively fortunate people who can afford to save that much money it can disappear faster than expected if more than one thing goes wrong at a time.<p>As a society we&#x27;ve decided we don&#x27;t want to live in a world where poor people die on the street (or are forced into terrible jobs, begging, prostitution, etc.). The problem UBI tries to solve is that the existing systems are incomplete, often create bad incentives, and require hugely expensive bureaucracies to review people at every step of the way. Providing a consistent income to everyone avoids things like someone getting the support they need to get a job, working hard and then having it all fall apart when they get a raise which is large enough to disqualify them from housing/child-care support but not large enough to replace it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the incentive to do more, however, unless you really think that most people in society will hit the basic minimums needed for life and never want nicer food, housing, entertainment, etc.",1453579154

At the very start, an untold number of mistakes were made, and the company spent months trying to recover from them. In order to stock products, the company had to enter information about each item into SAP. There could be dozens of fields for a single product. For a single product, such as a blender, there might be fields for the manufacturer, the model, the UPC, the dimensions, the weight, how many can fit into a case for shipping and so on. Typically, this information is retrieved from vendors before Target employees put it into SAP. The system requires correct data to function properly and ensure products move as anticipated.<p>A team assigned to investigate the problem discovered an astounding number of errors. Product dimensions would be in inches, not centimetres or entered in the wrong order: width by height by length, instead of, say, length by width by height. Sometimes the wrong currency was used. Item descriptions were vague. Important information was missing. There were myriad typos. “You name it, it was wrong,” says a former employee. “It was a disaster.” </i>",1453579133

You work because people give you incentives to do so. UBI just changes the incentives slightly: You can choose whether you want the minimum or whether you want to earn some luxuries.<p>You can argue about how many people are going to take the latter choice, but it&#x27;s ludicrous to suggest you would be forced towards it by your &quot;responsibility&quot; to the economy.<p>>No one is going to pay me more under UBI than I earn now because I work harder.<p>If lots of people stop working, then those who continue to do so will become a lot more valuable, and companies will have to pay them more as a result.",1453579123

10959781,comment,10955285,10955285,0,0,jdenning,,,"Forgive me for being a bit sappy here, but this post, and the discussions that it inspired here are <i>absolute gold</i>!<p>It&#x27;s certainly not the first time I&#x27;ve thought about this topic, but for whatever reason, the OP and much of the discussion is resonating very deeply for me (and apparently for a lot of folks). IMHO, this is some of the most productive discussion about privilege and opportunity that&#x27;s ever appeared on the internet; for the most part, this discussion has avoided the sort of aggravated competition (i.e. pissing contests) and judgements that generally arise out of internet discussions of privilege. In place of those nastier (albeit very human) responses, this thread is full of empathy, support, and offers of help.<p>I&#x27;m very proud of our little community here today.<p>I&#x27;m planning on writing a more detailed post in a few days after collecting my thoughts a bit more, but I&#x27;d like to share some half-formed ideas which this post has inspired (comments and criticisms are very welcome!):<p>1) Part of what&#x27;s awesome about this discussion is that it seems to have enabled a bit of ad-hoc group therapy. I think it&#x27;s very helpful for folks who are facing these hurdles to realize they are not alone; while everyone&#x27;s situation is unique, it&#x27;s great that people have been acknowledging similarities in their stories, rather than arguing about the differences.  We should try to do more of this (with other contentious topics as well)!<p>2) As several people have suggested, I believe that collecting these stories could potentially help a lot of people. I&#x27;m totally down to build and host a site towards that end - would anyone be interested in sharing their stories in that sort of venue?<p>3) While the specific issues that people have had to deal with are different, there seems to be some common &#x27;flavors&#x27; that many have experienced:\n    a) Socio-economic disparity causing an aversion to risk later in life\n    b) Lack of confidence in oneself which adds an additional handicap compared to more self-confident people, likely resulting in missed opportunities (you can&#x27;t win if you don&#x27;t play vs you can&#x27;t <i>lose</i> if you don&#x27;t play); impostor syndrome.\n    c) Lack of connections, again likely resulting in missed opportunities and increased difficulty in building new things/finding a job/etc.\n    d) Disparity in access to knowledge that greatly improves chances of success (e.g. importance of SAT scores to college admissions; efficient resource management; interview skills)<p>Improving the situation in (a) seems to be what the world at large is most interested in. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a difficult, heavily politicized, and therefore divisive issue.  By contrast (b), (c), and (d) seem like problems that we could really improve, at least within our own community.<p>For example, someone might have a harder time getting the type of (tech) job that they want due to a lack of personal connections (it can be really hard to get your foot in the door), however, it&#x27;s likely that the personal connections they need are actually visiting this site every day. While we obviously can&#x27;t just start providing references for total strangers, how much effort would it be to spend a few hours corresponding with someone and vetting their skills to see if you feel comfortable in recommending them? (I&#x27;ll put my money where my mouth is on this one - if anyone feels like they&#x27;d be a good fit at Cloudera, let&#x27;s talk! EDIT: just to be clear, I don&#x27;t really have any hiring authority, but I&#x27;m happy to talk to anyone, and potentially help with a recommendation)<p>Likewise, it seems that (b) could be improved for a lot of people with simple communication - impostor syndrome is very common in tech, so I assume that a lot of people here have advice on the subject, or just an empathetic/sympathetic ear.<p>Regarding (d), this type of information is all likely available already on the internet, but perhaps it could be more usefully compiled for this particular case, minimizing the number of unknown unknowns? What about a thread (like &quot;Who&#x27;s Hiring&quot;) listing offers for mentorship (&quot;Who Needs a Mentor?&quot;) ?<p>I dunno, am I just being overly optimistic here?  It seems to me there&#x27;s a lot of low-hanging fruit here, if some of us are willing to dedicate a bit of time to it.<p>More ideas? Criticisms?",1453579021

If your internet-connected special purpose device has more than N unit sales, more than $M dollar sales, or is offered in more than K brick-and-mortar stores, then it is subject to security regulation.<p>I too am not in favor (at this point) of requiring licensed assessors to approve software after it is complete, at least for most products. Embedded medical devices, vehicle control systems, and things like that probably should have an outside assessment.<p>I&#x27;d be happy for now just having some rules to try to make it so IoT device breaches are mostly due to bugs in the implementation of a good design, rather than due to the producers not having a clue about security.<p>I think we are fast approaching (if we have not already past) the point where good security practices are something that almost every programmer and software architect should know and practice. There should be basic coverage of this in the standard computer science/software engineering curriculum, and there should be more extensive coverage as an optional part of the curriculum. If you take these optional courses, your degree is &quot;B.S. in Computer Science and Computer Security&quot; (BS CSCS). (There should also be a way to get this training outside of college, and get some sort of certificate that you have had this training).<p>Those making products that reach the thresholds for regulation should have to have someone with a BS CSCS (or a certification of equivalent security training) who signed off on the architecture, development standards, and testing process used for the product.<p>My expectation is that as everything (for better or worse) gets connected, the vast majority of CS students will go for the CSCS option and so people with a BS CSCS will not be significantly harder to find or more expensive to hire than people with just a BS CS, and so even small new companies should be able to afford them once they get past the point of the founders doing all the work and start hiring employees.",1453578582

This is because all my functions were impure - something encouraged by most mainstream languages.

I wouldn&#x27;t fix it in the original place though, so next time I&#x27;d want to reuse I&#x27;d have to repeat every step again.<p>Since I started using a pure language, reusing code actually became possible. I can rip out a function and place it in a new codebase without changing it a bit and it&#x27;s gonna work just like that, no problem.<p>Getting back to the topic at hand, I would define the Blub paradox as &quot;being unable to logically explain the benefits of something solving a problem you haven&#x27;t realized is actually a problem yet&quot;.

It would work almost like a real fiscal union but its true nature would be somewhat hidden behind misleading nomenclature, complex and indecipherable legal agreements and new institutions with fancy names.

Now if there&#x27;s an error thrown by one of the statements in one of those do blocks, then you have no straightforward way to propagate it out of the function.

As an example, lets assume that Alphabet has a company working on driverless long-haul trucking. Suppose they take a pile of capital and start an endowment that then pays a small monthly amount to everyone in the political entity that could possibly stop them. To whom do they cut a cheque? Voters. They only need to get access to a voter database with names and mailing addresses. So now everyone who votes is getting a cheque from that entity every month, however small. Their marketing department comes up with some way to brand it so as to make those voters now feel warm and fuzzy about this scheme.<p>They then structure their company in such a way that the profits from their job-killing activity add to the monthly amount paid. In effect, they give every voter a stake in them continuing to do this. Then, when any law comes up which threatens their activity, they defend it as strongly as they would defend social security. Over time, this activity has generated enough profit that what was once a tiny cheque is actually large enough for people to pay a few bills.<p>The problems with this are:<p>1) I&#x27;m pretty sure the math wouldn&#x27;t ever work out to paying anyone anything significant. 140 million voters is a lot of people to pay. The cost of postage alone would eat up the payout in the beginning.<p>2) There isn&#x27;t enough incentive for an organization to do this just for the sake of profit. It would be cheaper to maintain a skilled team of lobbyists.<p>3) I suspect that people would be suspicious of cashing a random cheque that purports to be from a well-known company.<p>4) It might make voter fraud a non-trivial problem.",1453577312

For any successful build, it reports that header.<p>I used this to prune unnecessary includes throughout the TXR project.<p>There are some obvious false positives, like includes wrapped in #if/#ifdef and also certain system headers which look unnecessary on one system, but are actually required on others (due to the mess that is called POSIX).<p>After I applied some of the header removals, I pushed the changes to git and went through all the supported platforms to validate the changes. Almost every platform had some problem which resulted in some header having to be put back: MinGW, Cygwin, Solaris, Mac OS X.  For instance, Mac OS is a stickler for needing <signal.h> to declare the kill() function. On other platforms, it also shows up elsewhere, perhaps unistd. On glibc, you get va_list if you include <stdio.h>. Some platforms guard against this; they use some internal typedef name instead of va_list for vfprintf, so you must include <stdarg.h> for va_list. Various problems of this type. So just because a tool tells you, &quot;hey this compiles without <stdarg.h> just fine&quot;, that of course means &quot;well, on this system&quot;.<p><pre><code>   #!/usr/local/bin/txr\n   @(next :args)\n   @file.c\n   @(next `@file.c`)\n   @(collect)\n   @  (some)\n   @lines\n   @  (and)\n   @    (line linenum)\n   #include @header\n   @  (end)\n   @(end)\n   @(require (boundp &#x27;linenum))\n   @(do (rename-path `@file.c` `@file.c.bak`))\n   @(try)\n   @  (do (each ((rem-line linenum)\n                 (rem-hdr header))\n            (with-stream (s (open-file `@file.c` &quot;w&quot;))\n              (tprint (partition* lines (pred rem-line)) s))\n            (ignerr (remove-path `opt/@file.o`))\n            (when (zerop (sh `make opt/@file.o > /dev/null 2>&1`))\n              (put-line `@file.c:@{rem-line}: can remove @{rem-hdr}`))))\n   @(finally)\n   @  (do (rename-path `@file.c.bak` `@file.c`))\n   @(end)\n</code></pre>\nThe output is in a form that looks like compiler diagnostics. I can stick it in errors.err and run &quot;vim -q&quot;.<p>This simple tool works in conjunction with the project rule that that headers don&#x27;t include other headers. The .c files include everything they need in the right order. But the inclusions are added by hand by copy and paste, which can pull in something that isn&#x27;t actually needed.<p>You have to iterate the tool. If you remove some header which isn&#x27;t needed, a second pass can then determine that yet another header isn&#x27;t needed, because it was only needed by that which was just removed.

From microeconomic perspective it is interchangeable, but not from the macroeconomic one.<p>In fact, under UBI, someone may decide to pay you more money exactly because you&#x27;re willing to work hard. If you really have the choice of not working, you will have to be more incentivized (with money) to actually work.<p>In reality, UBI is just a different money redistribution scheme (compared to capital investment), nothing changes much for people who work. It won&#x27;t however make the people who invest and live from rent (capitalists) very happy, because they will get less of the pie to compete for.",1453577177

It has underfloor heating, with a central control box and remote sensors/controllers in each room. [1] It cost something like €1500-€2500, plus installation, plus the pipes etc.<p>The central control box has an ethernet port and MicroSD slot, which takes a ZIP downloaded from the manufacturer&#x27;s site.<p>I set this up, and was disappointed to see just how terrible the provided software is.  There&#x27;s no Android app, and the iPhone app costs a further €15 [2].  It has only the most basic functionality: see and change the target temperature in a room, and change which program runs (day/night/off/preset1/2/3).  The most-needed thing — to change the preset timings without 100 presses of a 5-button LCD interface — isn&#x27;t possible.<p>The web interface is the iPhone app implemented as a Java applet making HTTP calls to the server.  It&#x27;s too big to fit on my laptop&#x27;s screen. There&#x27;s an &#x27;authenticate&#x27; call, but it&#x27;s optional — the app requires using it, and the call gives the correct pass/fail response, but there&#x27;s no session handling so there&#x27;s no need to make this call before reading or changing temperatures.<p>The Java applet at least means it&#x27;s not easy to do a Google search for the web interface, but I just found this site [3].

In most developed countries, introducing a universal basic income would require us to raise the tax rate to about 70 %, which does not sound ridiculously high given that it already is at 50 % in many countries (e.g. Germany). Also, the net effect on income would probably be positive for most people at the low end of the income distribution. People with higher incomes would lose money though.<p>The most interesting question (to me at least) therefore is how this new tax progression would change the incentives for people at the high end of the income distribution. Theoretically it should lead people that earn a lot of money to value their free time more, which in turn would make them want to work less. Another positive effect would be the reduction of economic inequality through the higher redistribution of money from high to low incomes. In Europe there are some countries that are a good example for this. Sweden notably has a very steep tax progression for people with large incomes, such that some people reportedly even reach marginal tax rates > 100 % (e.g. Astrid Lindgren <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Lindgren</a>). As a result, Sweden has one of the smallest income inequalities among countries in the developed world (the Gini coefficient there is 25 % vs. 46 % for the USA). Higher taxation of large incomes reduces income inequality, which I think is (mostly) a good thing.<p>The question is therefore not if it&#x27;s possible (it probably is), but if people actually want it and think it&#x27;s fair.",1453576398

To me that means a couple possibilities.  Bug in the docker scripts, bug in the unikernal generator, or a timing issue, which a debugger won&#x27;t help you with very much (timing bugs are often also heisenbugs)",1453575741

The issues here are somewhat subtle and would take a lot of space to explain. But the end result is that we can remove a massive amount of confusion by getting rid of ADL.<p>- Error messages are much better, because the insides of templates never leak to users of the template.<p>- Typechecking is simplified, because we only have to typecheck each template once, at the time of definition, as opposed to repeatedly typechecking it from scratch every time it&#x27;s instantiated. This, in theory, allows compilation to be faster.",1453575730

The problem is politicians, suddenly there will be all sorts of new exceptions to your BI &quot;because&quot;. Then we are back to square one.<p>I see most BI suggestions as rationalization for giving up. Face it, there are a lot of people who would be and even some who are living at a level none of us can fathom. Do we really want to legislate an permanent poor class of people, one where there is likely more incentive to not leave it?<p>Finally how do you plan to prevent self destructive and generally harmful activities some will engage in. There are countless stories of generational incompetence, from high frequency of out of wedlock children if not even out of school, to not even finishing school? How can we incentivize good behavior, good for self and society?",1453575656

If less people work, less goods are produced, and prices go up. Similarly, if more people are buying things with their guaranteed income, there&#x27;s more demand, and prices go up.<p>This has nothing to do with judging people for choosing not to work, despite what you claimed.<p>Do you understand that opposition to this idea might not be motivated by wanting to have a system &quot;take advantage &quot; of people?

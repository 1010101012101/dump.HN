I guess if Amazon allowed everyone to programatically do that via an API warning then I guess everyone would simply build their software to bid up 1c at the time of warning... and at scale, everyone doing that would simply inflate the spot price higher and high to the point it would approach the full cost.",1260784764

993873,comment,993573,993573,0,0,herdrick,,,"The point of the post on lesswrong.com is that since it's agreed that Guede murdered the victim, you have completely explained away the murder.  So now you must start over, from scratch, as if the victim were still alive, and ask how likely it is that Knox and Sollecito killed <i>somebody</i> based on the other evidence: that both lied repeatedly to the police, that there was only one good fingerprint of hers within her own apartment, that she uses bleach to clean her apartment, and so on.  Taking that evidence by itself - without any dead or missing person, mind you - would you even accuse them of anything more serious than obstructing the police?<p>And yes, the priors - like the probability that a 20 year old female college student with no history of violence or mental disturbance of any kind would commit a murder - are certainly very relevant.  That is one of the least violent categorizations of humans you can create.  (In fact a more accurate prior would be even more miniscule: the probability that such a person would lead an elaborate team sex murder, an act so rare there is no term for it.)<p>(However, there is some other evidence that is hard to deal with in this model, like the crime lab saying that there is Knox DNA on the bloody bra clasp of the victim.  That evidence seems hopelessly entangled with the murder.  How can this model be used to reason about it?)<p>Anyway, all I know of the case is what other commenters here and the OP on lesswrong.com wrote, so my facts are suspect.  I've just tried to explain what the OP is saying.  Did I succeed?",1260782584

993871,comment,993573,993754,0,0,rms,,,"They lied about the evening and may have been there before or during the murder, then panicked after Guede fled, so they cleaned up because they knew how guilty they were going to look. It does not mean that they are murderers.
Also note that Italian defendants are allowed to lie while they are being called as witnesses.<p>I don't think the quantitative probability analysis of the Less Wrong thread is that meaningful in the semantics of the analysis itself, but I think it shows that a reasonable person would have a qualitative reasonable doubt about the murder.",1260782412

993868,comment,993300,993767,0,0,kroo,,,"In my experience perhaps the only way of dealing with characters like David Marks is by completely ignoring their contributions.<p>He does, I agree, almost have a point.  However, his lack of respect for those who spend time and energy contributing to these projects could (and will likely)  drive away many useful contributors.  ""Feeding the trolls"" is a dangerous game, much more so than avoiding the advice of a few David Marks.<p>The problem with this strategy lies in the fact that most open-source projects are large, open communities, where experts in a particular area useful to that project are likely not to be ignored.  John Resig's response to the situation (in which he condemns the entire comp.lang.javascript usenet group) seems an extreme (but perhaps appropriate) response to this -- he's sending a very strong message to those who contribute to jQuery: ""no more feeding David Mark"".<p>(I would also agree that this Matt Kruse fellow seems to be going about things in an excellent sort of way.

993864,comment,993725,993804,0,0,jsz0,,,"I agree the Android buttons are a bit of a problem. I dislike how every handset maker seems to implement them differently. HTC is a funny example because they use at least 4 different button layouts/orders. More than a dozen if you count clickable buttons versus touch buttons. That's a bit much. I'm not looking forward to upgrading to a device with a different layout in the future. I don't really care which layout is the best I just want some consistency.<p>The other issue which you eluded to is Back versus Menu -> Quit. I'm always a bit paranoid that Back isn't really closing an application and my battery will be dead so I often re-launch the app and look for a Menu -> Quit option. I have a little mental spreadsheet of which apps I can use Back on and which ones I need to Menu -> Quit on. Android really needs a more sensible way of handling multi-tasking.",1260781227

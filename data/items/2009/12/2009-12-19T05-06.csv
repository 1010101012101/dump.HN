1004534,comment,1004506,1004506,0,0,jazzychad,,,"Um, no? The Twitter API is nice, so far, but I wouldn't call it <i>complete</i> (this coming from someone 2+ years into developing twitter apps). Even with the current Twitter.com feature-set, there are more things they could expose through the API. As more features are added, more API endpoints will be needed.<p>It's nice that other sites have ""cleverly"" appropriated the Twitter API for themselves (something that Identi.ca actually did first, I think, and was the real inspiration for other Twitter clients to allow custom API roots), but that shouldn't mean that Twitter themselves slow down when it comes to innovating/iterating their own API.",1261201437
1004533,comment,1004127,1004525,0,0,iigs,,,"Great question. In the common case, the solution is to set low TTLs (time to live attributes: they tell the DNS server how long to cache the name) on the DNS records, so they expire quickly.<p>You can also run a pair of ""front end"" servers at all times, and use magic in the back-end to replicate the DB between sites. Depending on the type of site in question this can be really easy or really hard.<p>Another (generally commercial hardware) solution is to receive the query to one DNS server. This DNS server waits to respond for a few milliseconds while it sends a copy of the query to the other DNS server. They have different answers for the question (dns-east will return the IP for www-east, likewise for dns-west and www-west). They return the answers at the same time, and the closer server ""wins"" by getting to the recipient faster. This is called GSLB, Global Server Load Balancing.",1261201239

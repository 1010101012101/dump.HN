She immediately asked &#x27;Are you wearing anything?&#x27; and he replied &#x27;You&#x27;.<p>She told him &#x27;You better not have HIV&#x27; and he replied &#x27;Of course not&#x27;. She felt it was too late, he was already in her so she let him continue, she was too tired to tell him once more, she had been nagging him about using a condom all night.<p>She never had unprotected sex before. He said he wanted to come inside her, he did not say when he would but he did. A lot leaked out of her afterwards.<p>She told him &#x27;What if I get pregnant?&#x27;. He answered that Sweden is a good place to have kids. She jokingly told him that if she became pregnant he would have to pay her student loans.<p>On the train to Enköping he had told her that he had slept in Anna Ardins bed after a party. She asked if he had sex with Anna but he said Anna liked girls, that she was a lesbian.<p>Now she knows that he did the same thing with Anna. She asked him about how many he has had sex with, he responded that he didn&#x27;t keep count. He said that he had HIV tested himself 3 months earlier and that he had sex with a woman after that and that she was tested and not positive.<p>She said sarcastic things to him in a joking tone, she believes that she was trying to de-dramatize what had happened, he in turn did not seem to care. When he was told the size of her student loans he said that if he was to pay her loans then she would have to give birth to a baby.<p>They joked that the child would be named Afghanistan. He also said that he ought to keep abortion-pills with him that would in reality be sugar-pills.<p>His phone rang and he had a meeting with Aftonbladet (swedish newspaper) on tuesday at 12. She explained that he would not make it to that meeting, so he pushed his whole schedule ahead by one hour.<p>After that he rode a bicycle with her on the back down to the train station. She paid his ticket to Stockholm. Before they separated he told her to keep her phone on. She asked if he was going to call and he said he would.<p>She took the bike home, showered and changed sheets. Since she didn&#x27;t make it in time for work she called in sick and stayed home. She wanted to clean up and wash everything. There was semen on the sheets and she thought it was disgusting. She also went by the drugstore and bought &#x27;dagenefterpiller&#x27; (abortion pills).<p>After she had discussed with her friends she realized that she had been the victim of a crime. She went to Danderyd hospital and from there to Södersjukhuset (another hospital). There she was examined and also tested using a so called &#x27;rape-kit&#x27;.</i><p>edit: pdf of the original complaint (in swedish): <a href=""http://www.nnn.se/nordic/assange/docs/memoria.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nnn.se/nordic/assange/docs/memoria.pdf</a>",1454585894

11033286,comment,11032428,11033019,0,0,tempestn,,,"I don&#x27;t know if I agree with your parent that rent should generally cover mortgage payments, but it should at least cover mortgage <i>interest</i> and other expenses, plus a rate of return on top of that.  You need to take into account the opportunity cost of ownership.  In addition to the interest, insurance, maintenance expenses, and risk, there is an opportunity cost to the money tied up in home equity.  In a functioning market, if two people start with the same amount of capital, one decides to purchase a home and the other decides to rent a comparable home and invest the difference in assets of comparable risk, they will expect to come out the same.  There is a small net payment from the renter to the owner, but that is because the owner is being compensated for having their capital tied up in the home.  (Or looked at another way, the renter is paying for the benefit of not having to have their own capital tied up in the home.)<p>It doesn&#x27;t appear that way in practice, because in practice 1) the home owner generally started with more money, which is how they bought a home in the first place, and 2) ownership forces people to save money.  A renter with the same income could save a comparable amount of money to an owner, but on average they don&#x27;t because there isn&#x27;t a mortgage payment forcing them to do so.  So on average home owners tend to be wealthier than renters.  But there&#x27;s nothing special about ownership vs rent (besides forced savings) that causes that to be so.<p>Rent is not a wealth transfer from poor to rich; it is payment for a service.<p>Now, if house prices are depressed, like with any asset, it is possible that ownership will temporarily be a good deal.  (And vice-versa.)  In a situation where the market has taken a plunge, one might be able to buy in at a level where they could be cashflow positive from rent, even including un-rented periods, to an extent that over-compensates for the funds they have tied up in the house.  However, in that situation, people will rationally buy investment properties, increasing demand, and returning prices to a more rational level.  (Likewise if houses are overpriced, eventually people will stop buying them because they don&#x27;t expect any return on the investment, which will cause prices to drop.)",1454585329

Similarly prison conditions can be argued and again European courts can require commitments from the US regarding conditions and treatment before they would approve an extradition.<p>The Gary McKinnon case is illuminating into the thinking behind extradition from Europe to the US.<p>Finally it is also worth saying that Assange has probably also shot himself in the foot if he ever did face extradition to the US.

Save money -> invest money to grow savings -> time passes -> eventually you have enough to buy a home, if you want.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re saying that homes are so expensive, most people could not reasonably afford one even with disciplined saving and investing.  But at least as a long term state, that seems logically impossible.  The reason being, if homes were that expensive, no one would buy them to rent out either; because, either they would have to charge rent sufficiently low that people could afford it, in which case they wouldn&#x27;t make any return on their investment given the high cost of the house, or they would charge high enough rent to make a decent return, in which case no one could pay it.<p>Since the supposed problem is with home <i>ownership</i> rather than with finding decent places to rent (aside from special cases like San Francisco,) that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case though.<p>Now, special cases may certainly exist in some markets that causes housing to be scarce, but that will tend to make both prices and rents high.  I agree that that situation (limited access to housing) IS an important social issue.  But it is distinct from the ability to <i>purchase</i> a house, which doesn&#x27;t seem necessary or wise for everyone to be able to do without first saving.<p>Edit: Perhaps you were just saying that given low interest rates, one would not expect to earn much on a conservative portfolio.  If so, I agree; any appreciation would be a bonus, but the main thing is the savings side.",1454583700

It performs best-effort attempt to select the best slave to retain writes, but under certain failure modes its possible to lose writes during a failover.<p>This is common with many failover solutions of *SQL systems as well btw. It depends on your use case if this is an affordable risk or not. For most Redis use cases, usually the risk of losing some writes after certain failovers is not a big issue. For other use cases it is, and a store that retains the writes during all the failure scenarios should be used.",1454583647

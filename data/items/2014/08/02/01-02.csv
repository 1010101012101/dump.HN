As someone else pointed out, if G+ dies, all we&#x27;re left with it Facebook... and for what it&#x27;s worth, G+ is far and away my favorite social network of all time. Between circles and auto-awesome, the only way for it to improve is if G+ can poach some of the celebrities and news sources from Twitter.<p>As it is, G+ is an absolutely fantastic feed from my favorite news sources, sorted into relevant subject-matter circles. It hasn&#x27;t gained the mainstream adoption of Facebook, but that can be spun as a feature rather than a bug -- way more HN-style discussion, way fewer babies and gun nuts.<p>G+ Photos is by far the strongest aspect of G+, and spinning it off may spell doom for the network. I really hope not. Photo sharing and social networks go together like peanut butter and jelly, and Google&#x27;s done a great job of keeping everything private unless explicitly ordered otherwise.

8123705,comment,8123520,8123615,4,0,jzwinck,,,"I wondered about this too.  At a guess, perhaps they were doing a straight database dump from a production system which had sensitive information as well as public data.  They would then run a script to delete the sensitive columns before posting the dump.<p>This seems likely to have been broken at the design stage: systems should fail safe.  The first-order fix might be to check the return value of the sanitizer script and refuse to upload if it failed.  But a better solution would be to write a system which makes it much less likely to leak private data.  For example by copying only whitelisted columns (so if new sensitive columns are added to the system they are not dumped by default).  Or storing sensitive data in separate tables or even a separate database (this will take more work if levels of sensitivity change over time).<p>I&#x27;ve speculated here about the details to illustrate the point about systems design.  Unfortunately, too often the glue code for these sorts of things is written with little or no error checking, so when something is wrong the system just proceeds through unknown or unvalidated states as we see here.  It doesn&#x27;t help that the default language for cron and a lot of &quot;supervisory&quot; jobs tends to be Bash (or Dash) these days, where error checking is turned off by default.",1406943577

8123702,comment,8122138,8123662,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"> Comparing the income of Wall Street traders to physicians is bogus, the skills required are very different , and Wall Street is much more competitive and cut-throat than the medical profession is.<p>It&#x27;s really not a bogus comparison. Comparing to the average wage of all professions is meaningless, since a prospective doctor would be capable of getting a top paying job if he decided not to go to medical school. The proper comparison is between two jobs that a prospective doctor might choose.<p>More than half of all medical school applicants take a year or more off in between college and medical school, and Wall Street and medical schools are indirectly competing for a lot of the same talent - a person who decides medical school is too heavy of a financial burden may very well choose to work in finance instead. Students graduating from top-tier engineering schools, for example, are prime candidates for both fields (and it is not uncommon for someone with an engineering degree to work for a few years in finance before deciding to go to medical school)<p>As I said before, it easily takes 30 years or more before medical school starts to look like a good financial decision, and that&#x27;s assuming you make it that far without burning out and leaving the profession (as many do). That time frame is increasing, not decreasing, which means medicine is becoming a less attractive or sensible financial decision for the top-tier candidates, who are theoretically the very people one would most want to be performing one&#x27;s open-heart surgery twenty years from now.",1406943535

PRT extends upon ABA by, instead of rewarding with &quot;tickling him or giving him an M&M,&quot; using the patient&#x27;s restricted interest as a reward itself.

If I tell them I often also ask if they can put it into concrete examples of what I do differently. They never can.<p>This really hits home for me.<p>I&#x27;ve never been diagnosed as autistic or Asperger&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m very socially awkward, anxious, and have always been considered quite &quot;weird&quot; by peers and strangers. I also believe I share many symptoms with those who are on the autistic spectrum; if I ever saw a doctor I suspect I might get diagnosed with something.<p>I&#x27;ve also just about never been invited to any social gathering or to &quot;hang out&quot;, though even if I was asked I&#x27;d almost definitely make an excuse and say I couldn&#x27;t.<p>Any time I ask someone about exactly what it is that I do differently, I can never get a precise answer.<p>Over time I&#x27;ve come to realize what some of those differences are, and every day I try to consciously change or remove them, but it can be difficult. Sometimes I&#x27;ll forget, sometimes it&#x27;ll be very instinctive, etc. It really does feel like putting on a mask of normalcy a lot of the time though.<p>If it makes you feel any better, there are a lot of people like you and me out there.",1406941687

Without scores people would keep voting a good comment, so I'd imagine karma would be counted a bit differently.<p>Averaging comment karma sounds like a terrible idea. Some of the best posts are made in intelligent, long conversations several levels down the comment tree, which are almost never upvoted. Wouldn't it discourage such conversations?",1263578367

I feel a big difference hugging a loved one goodbye when they enter the security maze, compared to when they disappear from sight at the gate. They dribble away at the security maze, but man, at the gate they're <i>taken</i> from you. You see the plane door close and suddenly they're not even breathing the same air as you.<p>And when the plane taxis away, if you're at the gate you can press your face against the glass and watch, and wave if you're lucky. At some airports, like Seattle, it's possible to watch the plane through the entire taxi and takeoff. When my (now ex) wife flew from Seattle to China, I remember watching the MD11 take off, and following the plane until I couldn't see it and then the exhaust until I couldn't see it and finally watching nothing but empty sky.<p>Security theater merely irritates and angers me, but here they've taken away an emotional thing from me.",1263578283

The list is definitely on the more rigorous side (ie aimed at more researchers than practitioners), but going through these books (along with the requisite programming experience) is a useful, if not painful, exercise.<p>I personally think that everyone in machine learning should be
(completely) familiar with essentially all of the material in the
following intermediate-level statistics book:<p>1.) 
  Casella, G. and Berger, R.L. (2001).
  ""Statistical Inference""
  Duxbury Press.<p>For a slightly more advanced book that's quite clear on mathematical
techniques, the following book is quite good:<p>2.) 
  Ferguson, T. (1996).
  ""A Course in Large Sample Theory""
  Chapman & Hall/CRC.<p>You'll need to learn something about asymptotics at some point, and
a good starting place is:<p>3.)
  Lehmann, E. (2004).
  ""Elements of Large-Sample Theory""
  Springer.<p>Those are all frequentist books.  You should also read something
Bayesian:<p>4.)
  Gelman, A. et al. (2003).
  ""Bayesian Data Analysis""
  Chapman & Hall/CRC.<p>and you should start to read about Bayesian computation:<p>5.)
  Robert, C. and Casella, G. (2005).
  ""Monte Carlo Statistical Methods""
  Springer.<p>On the probability front, a good intermediate text is:<p>6.)
  Grimmett, G. and Stirzaker, D. (2001).
  ""Probability and Random Processes""
  Oxford.<p>At a more advanced level, a very good text is the following:<p>7.)
  Pollard, D. (2001).
  ""A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability""
  Cambridge.<p>The standard advanced textbook is
  Durrett, R. (2005).
  ""Probability: Theory and Examples""
  Duxbury.<p>Machine learning research also reposes on optimization theory.
A good starting book on linear optimization that will prepare
you for convex optimization:<p>8.)
  Bertsimas, D. and Tsitsiklis, J. (1997).
  ""Introduction to Linear Optimization""
  Athena.<p>And then you can graduate to:<p>9.)
  Boyd, S. and Vandenberghe, L. (2004).
  ""Convex Optimization""
  Cambridge.<p>Getting a full understanding of algorithmic linear algebra is
also important.  At some point you should feel familiar with
most of the material in<p>10.)
  Golub, G., and Van Loan, C. (1996).
  ""Matrix Computations""
  Johns Hopkins.<p>It's good to know some information theory.  The classic is:<p>11.)
  Cover, T. and Thomas, J.
  ""Elements of Information Theory""
  Wiley.<p>Finally, if you want to start to learn some more abstract math,
you might want to start to learn some functional analysis (if you
haven't already).  Functional analysis is essentially linear algebra
in infinite dimensions, and it's necessary for kernel methods, for
nonparametric Bayesian methods, and for various other topics.
Here's a book that I find very readable:<p>12.)

1055305,comment,1042793,1042858,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I guess it depends on how you define ""reasonably"" private.<p>E-mail is a little different than something like Facebook, initially, because Facebook persistently displays your data whereas email is a one-time thing; you list the people you want to see the email, send it, they receive it, and it's offline in the meantime, it's not a shared asset. So, in that way, it's not subject to the same kind of possible privacy alterations that a social network where your data is always displayed and available is.<p>That said, e-mail is rather insecure. While it might take more effort than sending a friend request, intercepting an email is still pretty easy, and people at Google can access your data. While it's not likely that there are Google employees going through random email boxes for fun, the contents and metadata of your emails can be disclosed through subpoena, security breaches, or other means.<p>So, while there is some privacy in a normal Gmail account, say, enough to keep a casual home or business user satisfied, that privacy is still highly dependent on competence and goodwill at Google.<p>The bottom line is that if you have something that really needs to be kept private, you need to at least encrypt your data with something like PGP. Your data is not private at Google and it is certainly not private on Facebook or Myspace, whose business depends on increasing pageviews and time spent on site at minimal cost (i.e., making extant content available to more people).",1263576333

This makes a CS homework assignment unpleasant, and a real world research project impossible.<p>Second, this really begs another post.  It should be called ""Learning how to read a textbook on your own."" Successful self-learners don't just __read__ a textbook.  They toil with it, try proving things on paper themselves, work through exercises, attempt to apply it to some real-world situation, and hunt down someone who's smarter than they are to explain something that seems unclear.<p>Not all textbooks - certainly not every one on your list - can be read with a great application in mind.  A reader must interrogate mercilessly the book on analysis or the rigorous probability book mentioned in the post.<p>This seems intuitive to someone who can successfully learn on their own, but most people are not taught to do that. The difficulties of relicating a portion of the classroom learning experience is a major barrier to entry.

1055262,comment,1055118,1055118,0,0,discolemonade,,,"I think the reason music makes us emotional goes beyond language. I think music also taps into the Amygdala, which is the part of the brain that regulates fear. There are certain sounds in nature that are scary or ominous. Low sounds like the sound of thunder or the low bellow of a lion are scary sounds in nature because they come from dangerous things. Things that make you disappear. Being afraid of those sounds is an avoidance mechanism, I think. People who avoided the things that created those sounds survived, therefore natural selection must have played a role in why we find certain sounds scary...or happy or whatever. It's possible to mimick those natural sounds artificially through music. That's probably a a big reason why music is so emotional. Sound informs us about what to like and what to avoid in our environment. Music just kind of fools the brain.",1263575199

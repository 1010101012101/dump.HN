Actor models can have much higher per-connection resource usage. Message passing isn't free, and wrapping each connection in an Actor/Greenthread structure isn't free either.<p>At the end of the day storing sockets in a hashmap is a pretty compact data structure. <i>If</i> you can minimize synchronization/locking, threads shared state is extremely efficient from a CPU and memory standpoint.

Its job is essentially to hold sockets and communicate with internal queues. The message passing model is alive and well, albeit at a higher level.",1282715833

The author is addressing what he believes is the decline of public educaiton <i>in general</i> in California, not just UC.<p>Some people outside CA may not understand that the UC system (University of California) is only one part of the public college and public education system in California.<p>As far as colleges, California also has substantial state funding for a lot of other non-UC California state colleges (CSU, California State University -- 23 campuses compared to 10 UC) and community colleges.<p>Of course, additional funding goes to non-college education as well, and grants that people receive who attend private colleges and schools.<p>Also future liabilities and pensions which are not included on budget.<p>So my point being--just focusing on your UC stats is misleading.<p>1. How about the whole California state college system?
2. How about community colleges, vocational education?
3. How about other forms of public education?

But I think at the root of understanding (as opposed to just proving empirically) is a set of nested analogies at an increasing level of detail. For example, if we knew that gravity was caused by say, gravitons, our understanding would be little more than a set of analogies about the gravitons (but ones that have been made rigorous and proven empirically).",1282713866

These kind of education articles are fucking stupid and only help fan the flames on all sides of deeply flawed ideologies. Beating this dead horse is so common that I've learned to tune these from out when NYT, NPR, etc run these formulaic education scare pieces.<p>The flaw is that you just can't compare apples to oranges and expect any kind of meaningful conclusion. In this case, it's cross correlating some super high dimensional manifold from 1964(or whenever) comprised of easily hundreds of thousands of variables, against a similar large manifold(2010). There are just too many totally different variables between then and now for it to be a fair comparison at all.<p>Sure, each side sees what it wants in whatever tiny slice of the data they <i>choose</i> to use.

I am more fearful of him ruining his own students by teaching them to mimic his own flawed reasoning than I am of any of his exaggerated, inaccurate conclusions.<p>You know what? More likely than not, the world will keep going the way it has been, people, kids, and education will keep <i>improving</i>, albeit incrementally, and there is not going to be some apocalyptic doomsday in the future of public education in California, or anywhere.<p>In summary, he's basically following the same pattern so many old people follow: somewhere along the way they lose touch with reality, with the youth, get stuck in their ways, and believe the whole world has gone to hell in a handbasket, and all because of some imagined flaw in the entire youth population. Old people forget what it was like to be young, and lose their ability to rapidly adapt and learn as children do.

The logic around controlling the connection is pretty intelligent in what it does.<p>A connection that's open isn't problematic at all, assuming it's being used - lots of setups/teardowns can be an issue (which is why polling apps will consistently take up a large portion of your battery life). The main issue is if the app is using a radio when it shouldn't be. Luckily, we can control this pretty well with our handling code and have been able to balance out needs pretty well between delivering a message as quickly as possible and not destroying battery life.<p>If you're an Android dev, we'd love your feedback on it in general :)",1282712963

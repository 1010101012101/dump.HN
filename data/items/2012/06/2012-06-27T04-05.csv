The programming language itself is Groovy which in turn is founded on Java<p>For those coming from PHP, Python and Rails the thought of using something based on Java frameworks may be a turnoff but I assure you all the boilerplating and configuration complexity is hidden away with the preference being the convention over configuration approach.<p>The beauty though is if you need to reach down and leverage some specifics you are free to do so, Grails doesn't tie your hands allowing you to have your cake and eat it to.<p>So in a nutshell, Grails gives you all the things you love with frameworks like Rails while under the Hood you can leverage the power of Java and all the supporting libraries and frameworks developed for it over the years. Anywhere it can go Grails&Groovy can go to (well almost). Oh and in terms of performance, the upcoming version of Groovy 2.0 will provide performance enhancements that will bring it seriously close to Java execution through static type checking and compilation. These two options are once again free to use or ignore as the developer sees fit.",1340772745

(2) ensuring that the process halts immediately, and 
(3) leaving an impression such that the candidate's likelihood of thinking & speaking ill of us in future is minimised.<p>The fact is, rejection usually amounts to disappointment and in some people that means they're about to pass through the stages of grief, often quite quickly.  As the rejector you have a chance of being on the receiving end of the anger & bargaining stages from a rejectee.<p>This creates an incentive to give away as little as possible.  If one states that the candidate was weak in a specific area, there are a few - just a few but it's enough to be a major deterrent - that will treat this as an invitation to negotiation over that and/or related points.  In the worst case this led to a large volume of unsolicited communication that proved challenging to curtail.<p>Thus goals (1) and (2) had not been achieved and goal (3) was abandoned in the interests of time.<p>From another dimension, IANAL but I have also been advised by Ms.IAAL that being specific also opens the door to a risk of being wrong (or even being simply perceived to be wrong), and thus a liability concern.",1340772247

There are many discussions here on HN about company hiring procedures. From participants in earlier discussions I have learned about many useful references on the subject, which I have gathered here in a FAQ file. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well (but only about at the 0.5 level, standing alone). One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risk to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that general intelligence tests used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p>Some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J.

For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""",1340770364

A stop loss is a very simple algorithm that is widely available in retail brokerage platforms. (Example stop-loss order: ""Sell when the last trade is 3% below my purchase price."")<p>For instance, you own 100 shares of Pepsi and plan to hold for a while (years, not days). Tomorrow while you are in a meeting, a large-scale accounting fraud at Pepsi is announced, sending the stock down some large %age before the circuit breakers halt the stock. Prudently, you had a stop-loss order limiting your losses to (say) 3%. In this case, the stock probably won't recover when the stock starts trading again.<p>If the stock had dropped and suddenly recovered due to a non-news flash crash, you would have just lost 3% of your investment for no fundamental reason. The flash crash in essence caused you sell at a localized bottom.",1340770301

I consider RPC server-to-server, not server -> ""smart"" intermediary -> server.  But I guess they want to to define RPC as request/reply.  So again it's a terminology issue.<p>What deployed, modern systems use tuple spaces and are substantively different from a message queue?  My impression is that ""tuple spaces"" were the historical name, from Gelertner's papers, but everyone just calls them message queues.  Message queues have lots of different properties but the defining one, as in tuple spaces, is that there's an intermediary between 2 servers.

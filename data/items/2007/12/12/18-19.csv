88805,comment,88005,88727,0,0,politrix,,,"No, it doesn't make sense to talk about Caucasian race. There isn't enough genetic difference between any human populations to divide humans into subspecies or races, unlike for example dogs. Humans have the least genetic variation of any mammalian species, so you can't make the dog comparison anyways.<p>Furthermore the name was created on fallacious premises to begin with. From the creator of the ""Caucasian race"" Johann Friedrich Blumenbach: <p>Caucasian variety - I have taken the name of this variety from Mount Caucasus, both because its neighborhood, and especially its southern slope, produces the most beautiful race of men, I mean the Georgian; and because all physiological reasons converge to this, that in that region, if anywhere, it seems we ought with the greatest probability to place the autochthones (birth place) of mankind.",1197485850

I currently use retailmenot's firefox plugin for finding coupons for the site I'm already on; I probably am more likely to use something like that because 1) I almost always order from 3 or 4 main sites (amazon, newegg, thinkgeek, and grudgingly dell.com), and 2) price comparison shopping never seems to be as accurate or rewarding as that $10 off coupon you never knew about",1197484467

It's looking for programmers who might not have the tools or the knowledge of deploying their own apps, which I think is relatively unlikely to find. I think programmers capable of writing their own apps would prefer to use their own tools. OH, BUT THAT'S JUST MY TWO CENTS.<p>Congrats on launching.",1197482546

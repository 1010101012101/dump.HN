I ran into all sorts of problems with corner cases, especially with nesting of block-level elements (lists/blockquotes/code). I wanted to switch over to a parser-based implementation, but at the time all the existing parsers were setup to emit HTML, so getting character-offsets out of the parser wasn't possible without hacking the parser to death.<p>There's been some good discussion on the Markdown list[2] recently about these sorts of things, a really interesting example is PEG Markdown Highlight[3], which is exactly what I wanted to do with my app, but I was too busy (read: lazy) to get around to.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://keshiki.net/markdown-editor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keshiki.net/markdown-editor/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://six.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/markdown-discuss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://six.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/markdown-discuss</a><p>[3]: Project: <a href=""http://hasseg.org/peg-markdown-highlight/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hasseg.org/peg-markdown-highlight/</a> Discussion: <a href=""http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2011-June/002129.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2011-June...</a>",1312801194

Commercially its become a bit of a buzzword. Which has led it being badly implemented.<p>I think designers often get frustrated when A/B testing is applied to their designs post-brief.<p>Designing a website for A/B testing purposes is a completely different brief. You are designing a toolkit for testing purposes. So that the next version will be informed.<p>A/B is quite is lot more complicated than some people appreciate. Ive often seen people create two completely different designs and then sort of let them fight it out.
Yet they learn nothing from these experiments. There could of been elements that work well for certain persona's in each design!<p>Fundamentally, designer can be quite precious. They don't like criticism like this. After all its impossible to measure all the factors and how does one measure 'creativity'. Plus some will feel like this lowers there input. why not just throw all the elements in bucket and see which comes up trumps.<p>As a designer I love using this sort of testing. Design by data is a growing trend, that i think will get wider recognition. Sadly the A/B testing phase can create some slightly odd combination at first, but when you go back a re-design the page. You know its going to convert better.",1312800993

A/B testing is intended to be scientific, so it must therefore adhere to rigorous scientific principles of validity.  Sure, there are those who implement it incorrectly, but a properly implemented A/B test should always have a (large) control group, against whom you can measure the purported improvements.  Such complaints as A/B testing inherently fostering incrementalism that leads away from proper design can be countered by implementing a ""proper"" control at each stage.  Similarly, his complaint of A/B testing being a binary proposition ignores the 0/1/many axiom of good engineering.  An A/B test that forces the user to choose between two unattractive options is a stupid test.  An A/B test that shows many options to be unattractive is a good test with a dissatisfying result.<p>Rather than question the underlying validity of the methodology, the author would be better served by questioning the validity of its implementation in the instances he's encountered.",1312799420

That metric is, if a person sees this variation of the page, how likely are they to tell people about the service.<p>For example if I include some sort of ""human interest"" content on my landing page such as my personal backstory on why I started the business, that might make it more likely to get mentioned in blogs. But such a backstory really doesn't mean much to people who are contemplating making a purchase and could hurt conversions. Not including it could deprive the landing page of thousands of leads. Including it could raise the conversion rate a bit, but there would be less potential customers to convert.<p>When a customer looks at the page, you are trying to make a sale.

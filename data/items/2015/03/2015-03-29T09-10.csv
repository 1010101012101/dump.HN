9284348,comment,9283922,9283922,0,0,karmacondon,,,"I was struck by the prescience and clarity of Mitch Kapor&#x27;s writing. He correctly predicted that a computer would be able to win on Jeopardy [0], 9 years before the fact. And he understood that the Turing Test was more of a thought experiment than an actual test [1], which is why I assume he took the bet in the first place.<p>Conversation is actually a rather poor measure of intelligence. I would say, show me a computer that can learn <i>anything</i> that it wasn&#x27;t specifically programmed to learn. This doesn&#x27;t mean unsupervised categorization or learning to play a video game. I&#x27;m talking about a scenario where programmers present their code or machine with no knowledge of what the task will be. Not something chosen from a known list of possibilities, but any task that a human could conceivably be taught to perform in less than an hour. Anything from writing a sonnet in iambic pentameter to assembling ikea furniture based on instructions. A true test of _general_ intelligence.<p>I would take that long bet out to 2129, and beyond. I don&#x27;t see software with that level of intellectual flexibility being written in our lifetimes, or the lifetimes of our children or their children.<p>[0] &quot;While it is possible to imagine a machine obtaining a perfect score on the SAT or winning Jeopardy...&quot;<p>[1] &quot;... a skeptic about machine intelligence could fairly ask how and why the Turing Test was transformed from its origins as a provocative thought experiment by Alan Turing to a challenge seriously sought.&quot;",1427622826

9284291,comment,9283105,9284251,0,0,benanne,,,"One of the authors of Lasagne here! Lasagne is being built by a team of deep learning and music information retrieval researchers. Keras seems to share a lot of design goals with our project, but there are also some significant differences.<p>We both want to build something that&#x27;s minimalistic, with a simple API, and that allows for fast prototyping of new models. Keras seems to be built &#x27;on top of&#x27; Theano in the sense that it hides all the Theano code behind an API (which looks almost exactly like the Torch7 API).<p>Lasagne is built to work &#x27;with&#x27; Theano instead. It does not try to hide the symbolic computation graph, because we believe that is where Theano&#x27;s power comes from. The library provides a bunch of primitives (such as Layer classes) that make building and training neural networks a lot easier. We are also specifically aiming at extensibility: the code is readable and it&#x27;s really easy to implement your own Layer classes.<p>Another difference seems to be the way we interpret the concept of a &#x27;layer&#x27;: a Layer in Lasagne adheres as closely as possible to its definition in literature. Keras (and Torch7) treat each &#x27;operation&#x27; as a separate stage instead, so a typical fully connected layer has to be constucted as a cascade of a dot product and an elementwise nonlinearity.<p>Layers are also first-class citizens in Lasagne, and a model is usually referred to simply by its output layer or layers. There is no separate &quot;Model&quot; class because we want to keep the interface as small as possible and so far we&#x27;ve done fine without it. In Keras (and Torch7) the layers cannot function by themselves and need to be added to a model instance first.<p>For now, all Lasagne really does in the end is make it easier to construct Theano expressions - we don&#x27;t have any tools yet for iterating through datasets for example, but we do have plans in this direction. We plan to rely heavily on Python generators for this. The scikit-learn like &quot;model.fit(X, y)&quot; paradigm, which Keras also seems to use, only really works for small datasets which fit in memory. For larger datasets, we believe generators are the way to go. Incidentally, Nolearn ( <a href=""https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn</a> ) provides a wrapper for Lasagne models with a scikit-learn like interface. We may also add this to the main library at some point.<p>Lasagne is not released yet - the interface is not 100% stable yet, and documentation and tests are a work in progress (although both are progressing nicely). But a lot of people have started using it already, we&#x27;ve built up a nice userbase and a lot of people have started contributing code as well! We&#x27;re currently aiming to put out the first release by the end of April.<p>A non-exhaustive list of our design goals for the library is in the README on our GitHub page: <a href=""https://github.com/benanne/Lasagne"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/benanne/Lasagne</a>",1427620567

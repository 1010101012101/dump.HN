The reason for this is that those people are almost guaranteed to be unhappy and perform poorly. That means that if your company just needs some code monkeys to crank out code to spec then you need to hire people that are perfectly happy doing that because it matches their skill level and ambitions.<p>Someone with enough initiative to start their own company is not likely to do well in that kind of an environment, and the fact that they look at it solely as crap they need to tolerate in exchange for a paycheck doesn't help.",1239580750

Their results tell you exactly how cheap SSDs need to get before they're worth using. Given that SSDs have improved 5x-10x on several metrics since this paper, they are already suitable for some workloads.<p>Also, the paper finds that for many of their workloads performance effectively does not matter so SSDs will only be cheaper if they are cheaper per GB than disks, which will probably never happen.

I'm one of the people who's been cheerleading the ""Even if you fail, it looks good on a resume"" approach.<p>Whenever you listen to any advice, you need to view it through the filter of Buchheit's Law: ""Limited life experience + overgeneralization = advice"".  Lots of people post about their experiences here, but nobody's experience will completely fit with your own circumstances.  So you've got to examine <i>why</i> it worked for them and determine if those same conditions apply to you.  In my case, I was applying for a job at Google in Silicon Valley, not a big company in the UK.  I had previous successful programming projects, though unfortunately nothing lucrative.  And I had sharp basic CS skills and did well in the interview.  I'm not sure how many of these apply to your own situation.<p>If they don't, you have two options:<p>1.) Make your situation look more like the people whose advice you've been reading.<p>2.)

Play up the aspects of startup life that will appeal to Company X: hard work, thinking on your feet, people skills, having to come up to speed quickly.  Play down anything that makes it sound like you want to leave in less than a few years.

559073,comment,558851,558851,0,0,scottdw2,,,"I wouldn't put too much stock in those numbers. To start with, they are not measuring actual programing language usage. If you want to know which languages people are using, the only way to really do it is to do a simple random survey and ask them.<p>What these statistics do is go to specific communities and attempt to measure which languages those communities use. Using those numbers to measure language popularity in the population at large makes the assumption that those communities are representative of the population at large. That's a faulty assumption to make.<p>Do you, for example, think that Slashdot has a large segment of the ""Excel VBA Macro Developer"" market posting to it? Probably not.<p>There are other sites, like Stack Overflow, that show a 2:1 preference for C# over Java. Does that mean there are 2x as many C# programmers as Java programmers? No. It just means that more posts on Stack Overflow are about C# than about Java.<p>Information about the number of unique books written about a language at a particular store does not imply anything about popularity. If you considered ""unit sales"", that might give you a measure of ""popular book subjects"", but not about language usage. For example, it could be possible that Java programmers buy more books on Java than C# programmers do on C#. Many of the C++ programmers I know have several books on C++. I don't think that means C++ has more users than, say, Windows batch scripts.<p>The web site does say ""these results are not scientific"", but I don't think that's a strong enough statement. The ""scientificness"" has to do with how the data is collected, and how the results are reported.  Even if they measured the same things using scientific means, the numbers still wouldn't imply what they claim them to imply.

I think you're right, however. If a two programmers were of equal competence, except one only knew about Java and the other sat on Hacker News all day, the Hacker News reader would probably only have a small head start.

Trying to introduce a third opinion to the fray is like a confused child dribbling the ball out of bounds; the ball will be taken away from him and put back into play.

6824348,comment,6820547,6821714,2,0,bitcuration,,,"The challenge of software estimation is rooted in software engineering.  As much as software wants to be called engineering, its current state of art is still craftsmanship, more of development than engineering.<p>Hardware engineering is possible as physics is the boundary and since has become categorically managed by human&#x27;s mind of structure and logic. A jumbo jet can be decomposed to millions parts each confined by own specification therefore once design is done the production timeline is easy to estimated.<p>Software production to this day is still struggling between modular development and any attempt to standardize on a way to create software is overwhelmed by thousands of new frameworks or libraries even engineering methodologies every day.  The reason software has such &quot;joy&quot; is because not like material or aerodynamic physics, software and way of making software are frequently derailed by its foundation, computer chips new advancement.  Literally, every few years whoever can exploit the new capabilities of computer hardware has a chance to become next Steven Jobs.<p>Granted, most of corporate enterprise software projects don&#x27;t have to aim high and certainly can be managed like any consumer production manufacture, so long as people are willing to settle on certain software framework, engineering approach, and treat pre-existed software component like real &quot;physical&quot; component meaning quit thinking the possibility of customize anything, simply focus on assembling.  This is the engineering propaganda from school of IBM, Microsoft and SAP et al have been trying for decades but reality is no one but the labor cost sensitive offshore software firm would be interested to this.  Everyone in corporate world pretend they&#x27;re working in a creative campus and fancy about the software they make is the core competitive edge of their employer.  The price to pay is uncertainty, but the question to ask is if their employer is in the business is in software business.  The hard part is even this question is full of uncertainty, who&#x27;d imagine Walmart will be compete on the software it runs based on its past business model, well that might change.<p>The art to be able to estimate accurately (heck, even Boeing failed 787 estimate) is to turn craftsmanship to production assembling line.  Stop thinking creatively, focus on manage a collection of proven engineering approaches of &quot;manufacture&quot; features meeting requirement.  Everyone in software industry should realize there needs a distinct separation between the creative making of software world and the basic business operation needs.  The line is not static though, as Google&#x27;s engineers constantly made IBM&#x27;s scalable/reliable enterprise software suite a joke.  Still, not everyone is google and effectively manage the evolution of this distinction is not easy but necessary, because while google is looking for uncertainty, most of corporate enterprise hate uncertainty.<p>Once accepted the confined world, it will be possible to maintain a model of software composition by different combination of modular components, pre-existed or further decompose.  The process can be fully automated and emulated as long as the time factor is added to each component.  The upside is this can be estimate/managed down to minute level yet the downside is that the software created would be boring lack lust, but built with complexity to support operation reliably which is enterprise software all about anyway.  Most importantly, once the estimate and cost become predictable, managing software system evolution will become a much easier and lucrative job.  Imaging how joyful will it become if you go to your CFO asking for next round of upgrade (or even revamp) due to the &quot;demand&quot; of some fancy new capability the business users have experienced from their personal consumer digital gadget, while your commitment to the money and time has a solid track record.<p>The key to resolution to the challenge of corporate software engineering, including the majority of creative product builder in start ups, is the lack of an effective and efficient way to manage the software evolution and the chaos it brought.  Sourcing to less cost labor or adding more bodies to the equation will not make it better, except short term psychological benefit.<p>In sum, software industry desperately needs automation.  Ironically, software starts as the automation king to everything else, but itself has been largely remained in the hand of artist.  The good news is cloud and DevOp are closing fast to bring an end to the nightmare of software engineering, at least an interim until the day software is no longer made by human.",1385841129

This gets further codified in the 1930s with the New Deal: tax supported social safety nets, government support for unions and corporate regulation.  The upshot of this is a new social consensus: the rich cannot get richer by taking a bigger slice of the pie, only by growing the pie.<p>Then World War II has two more effects: it finally kicks the U.S. economy into gear through massive government spending but maybe more important the rest of the first world (Europe and Japan) has most of it&#x27;s infrastructure heavily damaged.  The only other potential competitor, the Soviet Union, disengages from the capitalist economies of the 1st world and builds it own 2nd world of communist countries.  This leads to spectacular growth in 1950s and 1960s for the U.S. and with the New Deal consensus it mostly goes to the working class and the middle class.<p>In the 1970s, the consensus starts to break down primarily due to two factors: automation and globalization.  The rest of the world begins to recover and compete.  And because thy haven&#x27;t had the same sort of growth the U.S. did, their workers are much cheaper.  Additional automation begins to create an ever-lowering ceiling on how much a low skill job is worth.  Once the machinery to automate a job becomes cheaper than the worker, that worker is out of a job.<p>In the 1980s, the business owners (who never really like the New Deal) use their newfound leverage to create a coalition with libertarians and social conservatives to essentially dismember the government portion of the New Deal.  Once this is done, the pie continues to grow, but the rich have start to grow their portion of it.",1385839477

6824116,comment,6820547,6820547,1,0,systematical,,,"After getting a number of my estimates wrong recently I was thinking about this question. While walking to work I determined a few things.<p>It&#x27;s hard to estimate something that is complex. If I am very confident the job can be completed in under an hour my assessment is very close to 100%. This is because something simple does not have a lot of variables and interacts with very few things. Things like fixing a display bug, a simple calculation, adding a print now button are all easy. Once you go beyond this it gets more difficult to determine how long something will take.<p>Business wants the estimate done quickly. Many businesses want estimates done fast. An accurate estimate for a complex job cannot be given fast. There has to be several rounds of back and fourth. Use-case scenarios need to be determined, which will open up even more questions. The underlying architecture to accomplish the feature also has to be scoped which will take time and usually we don&#x27;t get it right the first time we think about it<p>Some more reasons are, businesses want the job done quicker than is realistic. Businesses don&#x27;t know everything they want. They think they need stuff that they never end up using. Haven&#x27;t thoroughly thought out the feature or problem themselves and that uncertainty gets passed into the development phase more often than not. Business is not solely to blame though. Sometimes developers think a particular portion of their code will be simple when its not or difficult when it isn&#x27;t.<p>Basically the whole process is riddled with human error on both sides.",1385838189

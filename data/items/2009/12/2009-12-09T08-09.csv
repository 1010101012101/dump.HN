Then assume that a good portion of those were just saying yes and will not follow through.<p>There's a significant benefit to saying yes in that you are more likely to gain the option of buying a sticker without necessarily having to buy one.",1260348684

This one was rather sparse on details and seemed to have as its take-home point ""The USSRians were morons, this could never happen in the US because we are better and people who do tests on reactors go to jail."" Now, this is not very useful. What happened in Chernobyl was a combination of technical failure, failure to follow regulations, bad design and an error cascade. This combination was significantly more likely in the conditions in the USSR at the time, but accidents on a smaller scale have happened, even in the US. <a href=""http://www.csirc.net/library/la_13638.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csirc.net/library/la_13638.shtml</a> is an interesting read, especially the first document linked.

Their whole sense of purpose is built around taking software from upstream and then mutilating it arbitrarily:<p><pre><code>  * License wank
  * Freezing it at an arbitrary version number for 6 months to 3 years
  * Patching it so that it works with your frozen dependencies
  * Independently backporting a random set of 'security' patches
  * Disabling features, often for ideological reasons
  * Dismembering it into separate packages
  * Rearranging its files to fit into a reverse hierarchy
    (which completely breaks any worthwhile language-specific module system)
  * Patching it to use a non-standard default configuration
    (often the personal preferences of the packager)

A woman can hope to have around 5-6 surviving children, with little risk to have none. A male has a real risk of dieing without children, but on the other hand the best case scenario is in the hundreds of offspring.<p>But the real consequence of a bigger male-to-female ratio will probably be plain old fashioned competition. Some men, especially young, will go the ""flashy"" way, but for most it will simply mean that having outstanding performance in whatever they do is much more important. Wouldn't want to be one of them, but for the society as a whole is probably good.",1260347292

985532,comment,982832,984812,0,0,idlewords,,,"In your essay, you implied that people were painting <i>alla prima</i> during the Renaissance, that Renaissance painters would start from a rough sketch directly from the canvas, and that they could repeatedly rework parts of the picture.<p>You can link every Dutch master you want without making your argument any less bogus.<p>Here's what I actually wrote:<p>""The allusion a sketchy, iterative style of painting that used to be called ""alla prima"", where you block shapes in in oil paint and then swoosh them around the composition as the painting progresses, perhaps repainting entire sections of the picture. This is the way Graham and I were taught to paint, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with painting in the fifteenth century.""<p>If you want to refute me, show me the Renaissance master who  painted directly onto a blank canvas, starting with a ""blurry sketch"" and iteratively refining it into a finished work, like Hals, or Manet, or Rubens, or Bob Ross, rather than working with underdrawings and thin glazes of color.<p>You can't, because no one painted like that then.

985531,comment,984189,984189,0,0,savant,,,"I agree with this sentiment completely. 12 months ago, I can safely say that my experience with PHP had been a simple modification of an ExtJS application and me screwing around with my Delicious bookmarks and the Yahoo BOSS API (both of these took more than a day to complete and I was very upset with life).<p>I decided that I should learn how to actually create working websites and over the Winter Intercession, I looked at the various frameworks. Being on a Mac, I looked long and hard at Ruby on Rails, but something about it's syntax irked me. In hindsight, it shouldn't have as my only experience had been with Java and other related OOP languages, but oh well.<p>I next looked at Zend, as many of the apps I developed for (Joomla, WordPress etc) were PHP apps, and therefore it made sense to go with what the Zend Engine people created. It took all of 2 minutes to realize that it would take me HOURS to figure out how to setup a basic MVC package. Not to mention a friend had used Zend in a previous project of ours - I developed the frontend in ExtJS, he the backend API - and was thoroughly upset with it.<p>I moved on to CodeIgniter and Kohana and thought it was great... except that it required that I specify a lot. I hate specifying things. Love automagic.<p>From there, it was Symfony, but it's application tutorial was too big and confusing for a PHP-noob like me (<a href=""http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/en/</a>). I think I just didn't give it enough of a chance.<p>Then I read about the recently released 1.2 release of CakePHP. Loved the name, thought the documentation and community names were funny - The Cookbook and The Bakery, respectively - and I was able to do the blog tutorial in less than 30 minutes (to their credit, I'm an idiot). I was happy enough then to start thinking about more complex applications and start to do something about them. I'm here almost 12 months later with around 30 or so active, open source projects on Github, 4 or 5 deployed websites, a few web applications puttering around on my machine, and quite a few in planning.<p>I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't limit yourself two a choice of two, but try several frameworks and languages. Try languages you don't know at all (Chicago Boss looked nice, but development has slowed. You could try using NodeJS! Django is cool too.) and try frameworks in languages you are familiar with (Someone mentioned Play Framework, which I think is the best RAD framework in Java, and PHP has CakePHP/CodeIgniter/Zend/Symfony/Lithium).<p>Choosing a language and a framework isn't about what excites other people, but what excites you. Find a combination that excites you and do it.",1260346974

Sarbanes Oxley was passed during the Bush admin when republicans were pretty strong in Congress (don't remember whether there was complete republican majority at that time). In any event, the republican line was that regulation is always bad government is always bad (except for wars), and everybody can self regulate. Also, for some reason, some conservative politicians really hated the SEC and would never give it more responsibilities or funding. So this seems like an attempt to have it both ways -- have a law and have self regulation at the same time, by allowing a board of accountants to set up some rules.",1260346559

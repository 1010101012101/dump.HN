For example you mentioned most founders being technical, but some VCs have promoted picking startups run by designers.<p>Let's not pretend venture capital is a completely neutral meritocracy. There are plenty of VCs who speak about the herd mentality within their profession and how many social factors like ""who's already invested"" have an effect on where money goes.<p>I thought venture capital would be full of strictly analytical decisions, but the more you listen to VCs talk about themselves the more you realize that they use many social factors to try to mitigate their perceived risk. It's possible things could be overlooked. It's not just complaining. How else could a person bring attention to something without talking about it? Edit: I don't see a difference between this argument and the belief that most of the startup talent is in Silicon Valley. Convincing and generally accepted, but not necessarily true.<p>edit: Don't just vote me down because you disagree. Please respond.",1319885465

3171578,comment,3169678,3171558,3,0,gchpaco,,,"The stock JVM is exceptionally bizarre about this because of the insane decision to pad all fields to memory boundaries (which means on a 32 bit machine a class with 10 individual bit fields consumes 40 bytes of memory instead of something sane, like, say, 2).  It also has an enormous amount of header overhead; a smallint on a competent Lisp or Smalltalk image takes up, say, one 4 byte word and can use 30 bits of that for data.  Java's Integer class which is similar in intent is (in stock JVM) somewhere between 12 and 32 depending on VM settings.  I've never seen another VM quite like it.  In a previous job we got burned pretty hard by the amount of sheer overhead in this and I had to spend about six months converting everything over to use raw int arrays and copy-on-write objects so we could fit a reasonable but not really huge dataset into memory.<p>Despite this, Hotspot is very good and the stock JVM GC is very useful and it is reasonably straightforward to get visibility into the state of the heap and what is going on with the GC.  I've never worked in a professional capacity that has anything comparable to VisualVM, although I gather Smalltalk and commercial Lisps have comparable offerings, and you only have to program in Ruby for a while to learn to appreciate the GC quality.",1319882482

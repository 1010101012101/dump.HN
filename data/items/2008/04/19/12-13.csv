Of course, there are ups and downs, but that seems more along the lines of the other thread.<p><i>Why do you guys believe that this is the right way to go?</i> I think it is very case by case.  In this case, I'm lucky to be able to self-fund this stage.  And I'm not ruling out investment later on if there is a defined plan I want to pursue that calls for it.  At this stage, I don't need outside funding and I can accomplish the rapid prototyping piece myself at a relatively fast pace.  I wouldn't have been opposed to a co-founder, but I didn't have the right one at the time, and so I moved on it myself.",1208609383

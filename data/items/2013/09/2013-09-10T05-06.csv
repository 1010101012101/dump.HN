From the story I get the impression that no one actually brought this issue to the teachers attention. The only context we have is that the parent offered to talk to the teacher for the daugher. The daughter declined and just put up with it for the rest of the year and avoided her classmates.<p>Kids are really good at hiding what they&#x27;re doing, especially in high school. It&#x27;s easy enough to not get caught by a distracted teacher that has 20 or 30 other students to assist. If this was happening in the open and the teacher was aware of it then there&#x27;s an issue, it&#x27;s very possible that&#x27;s not the case. Unfortunately I saw the behavior described in this article in a number of classes during my own time in high school and none of them were CS classes. There are people that will be cruel regardless of the context.",1378792721

You see, biological systems are far more complex than a few years of crop output, and such a simplistic take is clearly missing the bigger picture.<p>A field full of different crops is much more useful than a field of one crop because (A) it requires less maintenance (B) it can feed you more fully from a dietary perspective (C) it encourages a proper ecosystem to develop (insects, birds, etc.) (D) it is far more likely to prove a sustainable user of soil nutrients (E) with a higher density of vegetation and multiple layers of canopy, it will retain and therefore use less water, better surviving fluctuations in precipitation.<p><i>It would lower yields,</i><p>I believe evidence is to the contrary, but do not have the time to research just to convince you. If you are interested, please start by reading the Japanese farmer/microbiologist&#x27;s book <i>The One Straw Revolution</i> I posted earlier in this discussion.<p><i>...be difficult to harvest...</i><p>If you haven&#x27;t had to do much maintenance on the crops at all (weeding, watering, pesticides since a healthier ecosystem will prevent plagues of most pests, fertilizing, etc.) then a little more harvesting time is no issue.<p><i>(mechanical harvesters rely on uniformity)</i><p>We could always harvest ourselves on smaller scale farms, and anyway we&#x27;ll surely make better machines. It&#x27;s hard, but not that hard.<p><i>...and consumers like uniform crops.</i><p>Debatable. Organic Farmer&#x27;s market, anyone?<p><i>It also doesn&#x27;t make sense to take genetic diversity in a crop and plant it in a field because it&#x27;s completely ignoring our ability to design local crops  ones that are more drought tolerant given a region&#x27;s rainfall, or ones that could handle colder temperatures.</i><p>Nature does this <i>automatically</i>.<p><i>If your field of genetically different crops are all planted together, half may die if there&#x27;s a cold spell.</i><p>Sure. But if you then have a virus that infects cold-spell-resistant-genotype in the same year, at least you have 50% of your crops instead of none. And your overall time input was close to zero. And your seeds are real, fertile ones, that you get every year for <i>free</i>, giving you true food security.<p><i>Uniform genetics allow us to really understand what a single field is going to do, and this is why it&#x27;s so common. It&#x27;s also why there are vast field trials sometimes decades long for all crop varieties.</i><p>We only have some idea. We can&#x27;t predict much of the future, such as emergent pathogens or significant climactic variation.<p><i>Take the wheat example I gave above. Even if you were to plant every variety of hexaploid wheat in a field, despite different flowering times, milling characteristics, best environments, etc. one rust would still kill them all.</i><p>If you have diverse crops planted, the likelihood that one rust will spread to all physically separated groups of wheat is far lower. In addition, even if they all die, you still have food, and there will often be seeds that have survived and will return in the next year... Oh wait! That only holds true for <i>real</i> seeds, not the GM sterilized-for-the-profit-of-the-few industrial ones.<p><i>There is no resistance allele in this entire species of wheat. This is why researchers had to go find Sr35 in an ancient relative.</i><p>Aha! So here we have an example of a plant that we heavily domesticated, destroying genetic diversity and creating gross vulnerability to a single pathogen. That illustrates my diversity point well.<p><i>You could make the claim, well, we should be growing that ancient relative, but this is silly too  it would be risky given it hasn&#x27;t undergone the same selection for agricultural hardiness as modern varieties.</i><p>See, here&#x27;s the thing. We don&#x27;t know the future: so who are we to <i>select</i>? Nature does all this by itself. It&#x27;s a bit silly to waste our time trying to out-nature nature, when we could adopt a different philosophy and significantly increase our food security in measurable ways: maintaining long term genetic diversity, and ensuring resistance of annual output to single pathogens or other unexpected environmental factors.<p><i>As I said, there&#x27;s nothing magical about having a field of diverse crops.</i><p>But there is. By being closer to nature, it survives and thrives on its own with minimal effort.<p><i>A field&#x27;s population will always be smaller,</i><p>False.<p><i>... and encapsulate less diversity than that all of the world (and in other relatives).</i><p>Sure, but that&#x27;s a pointless observation. In any event, it will encapsulate a subset of diversity for each plant that evolves to suit to local conditions, and that is more resistant to crop failures than a single genotype.<p><i>If your so called black death came along and killed all but a few plants, why would this help?</i><p>Because you have multiple crops, so the reduction in one is less significant, and because your local genotype is better suited to other aspects of the environment and most challenges to plants aren&#x27;t Tom Clancy killer viruses.<p><i>There&#x27;s still too little to feed or sell.</i><p>Really, you should read about alley cropping, then read <i>The One Straw Revolution</i>, then watch some videos of permaculture gardens. You&#x27;d be surprised just how wrong you are about output from industrial agricultural monocultures versus diverse crop interplanting.<p><i>This disease already decimated the population, and our best approach is to breed an entirely resistant population the next year  not throw in more diversity and hope for the best.</i><p>I would say our best hope is not to do anything, and to allow the more resistant or miraculously preserved subset to return in its own time, lending its former space to other species as nature sees fit.<p><i>We can intelligently leverage diversity in breeding, which is more optimal than just planting diverse fields.</i><p>More optimal .. for what set of conditions? Not a sustainable or self-sufficient food security goal for most of the human world. Though, perhaps more optimal for profits for industrial farming companies who have little interest in actually looking after the land, water tables,  ecosystem or community past the bare minimum necessary to ensure continued profits.<p>> Third, your backcrossing line is dubious. Biology is good at survival, we don&#x27;t need to tend to it ourselves. If we reach a state where we do, then gee golly: we&#x27;ve clearly buggered up hundreds of millions of years of success in a right jiffy!<p><i>Sure, but then go eat teosinte rather than maize. I think you&#x27;re forgetting that we domesticated varieties to survive with our help, and to feed us. Through breeding we can grow maize in Wisconsin rather than Mexico. If backcrossing is dubious to you, you should stop eating all crops because I guarantee all have had parents that have been extensively backcrossed.</i><p>Historically speaking, large scale agriculture was heavily linked to the emergence of a state, wielding a monopoly of force to extract corvee labour, military service and taxation from a population. Perhaps it&#x27;s time to put that history to rest and consider less uniform crops, more seasonal diets, and a swing back toward more decentralized production of a greater variety of foods.<p><i>Please if you have some magic way to do this and feed met the world&#x27;s food demands, become a plant scientist! But I think you will find that it&#x27;s just not this easy.</i><p>Actually I&#x27;m going right for the throat: the financial system.

(at least on purpose) But the attitude is accepted and even defended, which is obvious just reading the comments on any article involving women in tech on HN.

You&#x27;re looking at the story and relating it to a thin-skinned woman who can&#x27;t handle non-politically-correct humor in the workplace. I&#x27;m relating it to a 16-year-old kid who hasn&#x27;t had the time or experience necessary to develop the thick skin and snappy retorts that would shield her from her peers&#x27; disrespect. She&#x27;s not getting passed up for a promotion; she just wants to learn programming. It&#x27;s entirely within the job description of a teacher to notice, step in, and set standards for behavior in the classroom. Even when they&#x27;re not met, they communicate more than tacit acceptance of bad behavior.<p>I completely agree that people in general, and women in tech specifically, have to be thick-skinned to survive professionally. Nobody&#x27;s advocating HR thought police--they&#x27;d be unnecessary in this case anyway--or politically-correct automatons. We&#x27;re talking about kids. Kids! Surely it&#x27;s not totally out of line to suggest that they could learn better behavior than &quot;get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich&quot;. Surely there&#x27;s a better response to the whole situation than &quot;that girl needs to suck it up and learn how the world works&quot;.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I remember the first time those trite cliches were thrown at me, and they felt neither trite nor cliched. They hurt. I thought I was part of a team, among equals, brothers-in-arms, friends, and I wasn&#x27;t. I was different, I was other, I was less, I was not welcome. It&#x27;s a paradigm shift that happens in an instant, and it can be pretty shattering--great for killing enthusiasm and developing thick skin in the future, maybe, but not for learning things in a programming class.",1378790082

The percentage of DWTS watchers who are women is no predictor of what women do.  This fallacy is called <i>confusion of the inverse</i>, and it&#x27;s a probabilistic variant of the better-known <i>converse error</i>.<p>Second, even if 99% of women were to be DWTS fans, it has no bearing on anigbrowl&#x27;s comment.  The reason that &quot;while your wife watches DWTS&quot; is part of the problem (as anigbrowl identified) is that it implies that (watching DWTS) is to women as (checking out 1130 sims) is to men.  It implies that in situations where men do interesting tech things, women watch TV (I assume &quot;DWTS&quot; is some kind of TV?).  It&#x27;s basically a put-down against women collectively.  Note that if someone were to be putting down humanity collectively, I wouldn&#x27;t complain.<p>Third, &quot;politically correct&quot; is a label principally used by reactionary dullards to dismiss arguments or objections that they see as excessively leftist.  It&#x27;s equivalent to calling someone a commie.  Mind you, some people are communists, some people are knee-jerk excessive leftists, etc... but if that&#x27;s true in a particular situation, you can just explain why it&#x27;s true.

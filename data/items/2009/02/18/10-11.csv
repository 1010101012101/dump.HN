485587,comment,485498,485498,0,0,CalmQuiet,,,"Well, O'Reilly recently reported that sales of of computing books in general were off something like 28% for 2008.  So starting a new occupation (software archhitect) or pandering to those who'd aspire to the ""title"" may be a marketing strategy.<p>According to Amazon (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/isbn/dp/059652269X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/isbn/dp/059652269X</a>) the book was to be released Feb 13.  I put it in my Amz shopping cart so I can let the reviews thereon tell me whether it's at least worth skimming it at Barnes & Noble (all that's available to me locally).",1234953071

485584,comment,485498,485551,0,0,swombat,,,"Nothing's proven flawed. Both of those pieces of advice work under the correct, narrow circumstances.<p>If you're building a web start-up, forget specifications. Write code. There is no way to have the slightest clue what you need to specify anyway. Write something that does something useful and put it in front of some users. Go from there. In different circumstances, of course (e.g. while building the software for a major Stock Exchange), this is the absolute worst thing you can do.<p>If you're building your start-up, it's almost always too early to think about performance. You need to have some vague awareness of whether it will be possible to optimise your code later and keep it clean and simple so that it remains possible, but ultimately I've found that it pays to optimise at the last minute - i.e. optimise when there are performance problems, not before. On the other hand, going back to the major stock exchange example, performance there is likely to be one of your major challenges, so you need someone on the team who is performance-minded and has built a stock exchange before, so that they know where the bottlenecks will be and can ensure those are avoided.",1234952449

485569,comment,485036,485505,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think there are two points to that: the first one is the interest on that loan, which compounds and could end up to be several times the actual amount, the second is that the dollar has devalued significantly because of all this further increasing the deficit in case a part of the debt is in another currency.<p>If you spend 5% on top of your GDP annually (if it is that much I can't verify) and you do that for two decades you're in hock for a full years worth of GDP. If you think about GDP as your whole salary before taxes and costs then you can see how long it would take you to pay back that loan.<p>I hope that's all correct, I'm nowhere near an economist but that's how I read it.",1234951371

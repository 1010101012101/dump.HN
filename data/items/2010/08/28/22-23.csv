That is, some of the vast difference in unemployment between college graduates and those without right now is just due to hiring managers (who are largely college graduates) being more comfortable with the sort of person who has gone to college. Part is due to the more advanced skills required in the modern American economy.<p>Regardless, this bad recession has dramatically underscored the value of college experience as an important thing for someone who places even a mild value on lifestyle security. Or to put it another way, it is a huge risk to bet that in the future, college experience will stop being seen as important. You might be right. But if you aren't, and you experience misfortune, your expectations are going to be much better with a college degree to wave around than without.",1283036046

1642571,comment,1642210,1642210,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"It's good they are doing this. Facebook had no business running an incubator - they didn't have the people, the experience, or insights. They just threw money at the venture and hoped for the best. The fbFund program cash really helped us get going early on, but the institutional support didn't work for us, and since the program has been shuttered, I assume that sentiment was shared. The money really is just a small part of one of these programs.<p>Under the fbFund incubator program, we won a $25,000 grant, and that was the sum total of their support for us. After that, all follow-up consisted of admins with no entrepreneurial or programming skills, demanding documents in the middle of the night. At some point, I got some support from a Facebook developer, but he only replied to one email, and then ignored my follow-up. The whole thing was run like a marketing campaign, and they tended to focus on getting us to go along, rather than engaging us as a partner and trying to help us succeed. I have no hard feelings about this, because the money let us write a lot of code and practice at starting up, but we might still be focused on Facebook if we had more technical and marketing help. Meeting Zuck would have been a good sign too.<p>Even with YC to look at for guidance, they didn't understand what made YC tick - uniting a community of the best and brightest, under the tutelage of a a great entrepreneur. If you have ever been down to YC HQ (I have once), you would know what I mean. One of the primary reasons we haven't worked on the Facebook aspects of our company for a while now is because of the experience we had as an fbFund company. Also, at the time, the API was extremely immature, as were the docs. I remember just giving up on sending out notifications many moons ago, and I never looked back. I also remember getting tripped up because I tried to follow the rules and not store user names to show in comments, but everyone else was breaking the ToS and Facebook turned a totally blind eye.<p>I knew some other fbFund companies from later rounds (we were round 1 I think), who got support instead of money, and they seemed to think it was worthwhile. But, I don't know that any of them has a successful business today, so they were still missing something key.<p>I should apologize, because Facebook helped us out, and this is a bit critical, but I think it's honest and worth posting. The program certainly had good intentions and good financing, but it was poorly conceived. Of course, they know all of this, and Facebook has a reputation for measurement and changing quickly, so that's probably why they are taking these steps to fix things now. They certainly picked the right partner in YC.",1283035897

1642569,comment,1639314,1642082,0,0,jules,,,"Oh, if every sentence is true then the combination is true. But true or false is not an exact property of a sentence, it's a fuzzy property of a sentence in a particular context. For example the meaning of ""good founders are tough"" depends on what's good and what's tough. The meaning of tough could be ""doesn't give up quickly"", but could also be ""doesn't cry when he gets hit in the face"" or many other things.<p>So take this blog post. The entire meaning of it hinges on the meaning of ""wimp"" and ""though"". And while the reader could fill in a meaning of these two words that makes the blog post make sense, many readers here seem to have interpreted it with a different meaning than was probably intended by the author. For these readers the blog post reads like bullshit.<p>A sentence in a text can influence the meaning of another sentence. For example:<p>""I don’t think there is anything particularly new here. PG says that the definitive description of good founders is “relentlessly resourceful.” I’m pretty sure that “toughness” is a big part of that. Can you take care of yourself and get (sh)it done, or are you a wimp?""<p>This partially establishes what the author means by ""tough"" and ""wimp"". But in my opinion it's not clear enough what he means by ""though"" and ""wimp"" to conclusively say that the blog post is correct or to say that the blog post is incorrect. It depends on the preconceived notions of the reader.<p>p.s. so a simple example would be:<p>""Tough people don't cry""<p>""Good founders are tough""<p>Even though both are not false in isolation (but not true either!), the combination is false.",1283035806
1642568,comment,1641827,1641827,0,0,knowledgesale,,,"I find it to be waste of time when people put conscious efforts to listen to more classical music and to educate themselves about it.<p>Music is usually considered to be an intellectual endeavor like art and science. But there is a crucial difference for music. Science and art (at least the best of it) give us new insights to the world we live in: ideally we understand things and people more as a result.<p>But the ultimate purpose of music is a physiological/emotional response, something utterly subjective and that does not enrich our objective understanding of the world. In this sense, music should be considered to be an indulgence like drugs, sex or delicatessen food, in all but the delivering mechanism. Not that there is something wrong with them, but these are pleasures, not a meaningful activity.<p>Thus the whole notion of the special kind of music that bears higher value is of no more sense to me than, say, meth of higher culture.<p>Life is too short for it.

1642564,comment,1641763,1641912,0,0,d4nt,,,"> ""Move up the ladder into management, architecture, or design""<p>The ability to convert detailed specs into code is a fungible commodity. Management, architecture and design, on the other hand, are areas of software development where you need multiple complementary skills; technical ability, good communication, understanding of your customers and industry area, an ability to influence others, etc. People like that cannot easily be replaced, hence the higher price. In some cases technical guys appear to need those things too, but that's just because they're unofficially doing the job of an architect, manager or designer.<p>> Even though you may be highly experienced and wise, employers aren’t willing or able to pay an experienced worker twice or thrice what an entry-level worker earns.<p>Define wise. That sounds a lot like ""capable of being an architect/manager/designer"". If you're capable but resisting the promotion then I'm suspicious of your claim to deserve more money.<p>I agree with you that an experienced coder will be more productive than a less experienced one. But I would also say that 20 years experience will never make up for a lack of natural ability. I've interviewed programmers with decades of experience who failed the most basic of our technical tests (think FizzBuzz). I'll bet for every old timer who's excellent and just wants to stay a coder, there are 5 who are just below average and have never been offered a promotion.<p>I see the issue more as a failure by the good experienced coders to differentiate themselves in the marketplace than a conspiracy against old people. If you've been doing something for 30 years but all you're selling is ""5 years python experience"" just like everyone else then why should I pay you more? Tell me why you're worth more. Convince me you're lack of promotion comes from a passion for your craft and not just down to a lack of ambition or ability.",1283035581
1642563,story,,,26,61,0x5a177,"Ask HN: Startup stopped paying my salary",,"My first job out of college was for an ""internet media"" startup right across the street from school.  Long story short, after a few years they started running out of cash. Salary started coming a few days late, then weeks, then a month. At the point when they owed me 2 months of salary, I quit and started looking for a new job full-time (which I found after a couple months, thank God).<p>Whenever I talk to the founder, he typically says they have ""potential investors"" and the money should be coming in a few months.  I'm not as stupid as I was, and I'm sure that no money is coming in.  Who wants to invest in a startup that hasn't been profitable for 5+ years and has back salary obligations to multiple employees?<p>I can survive without the money, but it's still a pretty good chunk for me so it's worth it to me to put in effort to retrieve it. Problem is, I don't really know how to approach it.  I see my options as being: 1. Go to the law; 2. Approach them aggressively; 3. Forget about it.<p>I've been thinking about filing a wage claim with the state (California), but I would rather settle directly with the company rather than go through the state.  I can't really forget about it because it's a decent chunk of change.<p>There is a little twist, and that is that my experience with the founders and officers was very good up until the point they stopped paying me.  They took us out to nice lunches and bought us the first iPhones on launch day (even bought me a new one when I dropped mine).  They sent me all-expenses paid to WWDC, Google I/O, OSCON, and SIGGRAPH. I essentially got my career started at that company. It was my first job as a developer, and when my boss left I got promoted to ""CTO"" and got to hire my own small team. This is one of the main reasons I haven't really ""gone after them"". I don't really want to screw them over, I just want my money.<p>Any advice would be welcome. Thanks!",1283035541

(Which I think you already addressed in another comment that your target audience is maybe the overlap of developers/composers.)<p>I'm reading through your Introducing SolidComposer page and I think it would be helpful if you could condense that down and put it somewhere more accessible (maybe on the front page).  I find myself not really wanting to spend time figuring out how the app will help me.<p>Also, the How Does It Work? section actually does not seem appealing.

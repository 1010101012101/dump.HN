4299773,comment,4299196,4299196,1,0,JamesLeonis,,,"Ok, I'll admit that I have quite a few problems with what is here, both for the business end and the engineering end, but I'll just name my two biggest here.<p>1.<p>While nothing on this outline strikes me as outrageous in terms of time, looking closely will uncover a huge amount of resources and time that is required on behalf of the student.<p>Let's be perfectly honest with ourselves here. Learning programming for the first time in any language isn't something you can write off as easy or quick. I have attended courses that wanted to teach a language from start to competent, and they ran three months with 24 hours per week devoted for learning the syntax and application. This didn't include any data structures, algorithms, math, or other CS fundamentals [1]. Even then classmates struggled. I led several study sessions to help people with thorny concepts. All of this just to learn the basics of one language for the first time.<p>In addition to all this learning, you need something to apply it (More on this below). This requires blocks of markedly non-trivial amount of time. You will be stretching your brain to try to fit what you learned to the problem you are having at any given moment, as well as the bigger task you want to accomplish. This is where you start to grok what you learned.<p>Granted this isn't impossible, but with everything else people have to do in life it seems very strenuous.<p>People need downtime to let their brain relax. Since there is a mentor involved, I am assuming that there is some sort of rubric they are applying, thus none of what is mentioned here can be considered as a pleasurable activity. This is work, no matter how much fun you have doing it.<p>There's also the issue of part time work. Those business books and Treehouse accounts don't pay for themselves. You still need a place to live, to eat, and some spending money outside of the necessities. None of this stuff is free. There might be somebody who is paying for all that for you, but many do not have that luxury. Part time minimum wage work of 20 hours is seriously stretched for room and board expenses, much less course textbooks and pocket change. [2]<p>Let's look at the time breakdown of one week. We have:<p>25 hours to learning programming. Includes coursework and project time.<p>12 hours for business books and blogging. 2 hours a day (5 days) reading and taking notes, and 1 hour per blog post.<p>2 hours for the other book.<p>1 hour with the mentor.<p>4 hours volunteering.<p>3 hours of exercise.<p>2 hours meeting somebody.<p>Subtotal: 49 hours per week.<p>20 optional (maybe...) hours for work.<p>Total: 69 hours per week.<p>That's just the requirements for the first year. I haven't looked into what it would take for the door-to-door sales in year 2, the white paper in year 3, or learning a language and travel in year 4.<p>2.<p>I am going to assume four months (16 weeks) of vacation per year for things such as Christmas and Summer break. That might be generous, so hear me out. That leaves 38 weeks of learning under these courses.<p>That translates to about 38 business books and 8 outside books per year. Thus you will have read 114 business books and 32 outside books over the course of the four years with a grand total of 146 books. A student would chew through your list [3] before finishing his first year. I'm not counting any technical books they will go through [4].<p>How much of that can you realistically expect to remember?<p>What is preventing this student from learning the material, especially the business books, enough to write about it in their blog post and then forgetting it? How much of any education is remembered beyond the test? What I see here is a lot (and I really mean <i>a lot</i>) of information absorption without any focus on how to cultivate retention.<p>To force the long term storage of information would mean free-form projects where the student must apply the information they learned. While the technical end might accomplish this some through posting code to Github, simply doing tutorials won't force your head to remember what you learned. Even the project, scratching that itch, will not be enough. CompSci has several unsexy topics that a student would need to learn [5]. This is even worse for the business book section, where application is very hard to do in a traditional MBA learning environment.<p>Some people are very good at retaining arbitrary information for long periods of time and others are not. What will be remembered is a four year long blur of reading, writing, and some code, but the student will be hard pressed to do any effective recall of what they learned.<p>---<p>[1]: Don't underestimate CS fundumentals. Algorithms and their analysis and data structures are very important to understand. You might never write one yourself, but I <i>guarantee</i> you will use them. Honestly, where is the math in all of this study?<p>[2]: I'm assuming this is geared for the typical college demographic, thus the 18-22 bracket. Unless you are extremely talented/gifted, you will be working minimum wage. That's around $8/hour for 20 hours, so you will pocket $640 a month.<p>[3]: I don't see Peopleware on that list. Now I'm very suspicious...<p>[4]: Unless they are taking the MIT/Stanford/etc courses, I haven't seen a good comprehensive CS course online. Most focus exclusively on a particular tech, like Rails or Javascript, and eschew the general CS coursework. I would love to be proved wrong though.<p>[5]: Granted you <i>can</i> skip some fundamentals, there are others should not. Security and Cryptography come to mind as something most CS students do not want to dive into, but are VERY necessary for any web service.<p>This post ballooned into something much larger than what I envisioned...",1343357393

This is not brute-forceable with an aperiodic tiling, pretty much by the definition of an aperiodic tiling.<p>Let's say you have a pattern P, and you want to check if it's a glider. In Conway's Life, this is straightforward and mechanical: iterate the future states of P, and check if any of them are P  but translated some distance. But on a Penrose board, this is not possible: if you translate the pattern, the board is different. You cannot assume that because P translated successfully once, it will translate again (i.e. you cannot ""induct"").<p>Furthermore, because the tiling is aperiodic, even brute-forcing the possible patterns is troublesome. Every pattern must specify its origin! On Conway's life, there is only 1 possible 1-tile starting pattern, and only 2 non-trivial 2-tile patterns, because it doesn't matter where you are. Starting your pattern at (0,0) doesn't make it any different than starting at (12,-156).

The example of HAM radio was a poor one, I was associating it with Low Frequency [1] radio when it in fact covers a much larger spectrum.<p>I agree that telecommunications is a hard subject, and even more so that different technologies are useful for different purposes. That is why I think the original comment was off:<p>> If you could rig up visible-light laser communications, you wouldn't need the fiber. Fiber's just a convenient container.<p>Something we haven't really talked about, and I'm not sure how relevant it is, is the saturation of the wireless spectrum. Point to Point wireless is obviously a different beast, but for broadcast wireless is there a saturation point where we can't safely send more data over the airwaves?<p>I like that fibre is by construction point to point, not restricted by line of sight, capable of very high bit-rates with relatively low energy (correct me here if this is wrong), and excellent quality of service.<p>Wireless has a lot less infrastructure, particularly when used for the last mile, and is definitely extremely convenient in many situations. I don't think it is the solution for general purpose network infrastructure, though that may change in the future (and is clearly the choice for some countries already).<p>I wonder what the replacement for fibre will be in 20-30 years time - is wireless the only frontier at the moment?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_frequency#Propagation_of_LF_signals"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_frequency#Propagation_of_L...</a>",1343356339

It looks like the left column is left aligned, and the right is right aligned, but on larger monitors that doesn't seem to have an upper bound, so those things are too far apart for me.<p>- The screenshot is too small, and hard to discern.  This is mostly an issue only because of the aforementioned space -- so there's clearly room to make it bigger, but even if you made it bigger within the faux monitor, it'd be more visible.<p>- The feature list is a little too close together, space-wise.  Horizontally everything's okay, but vertically I'd add about 10-15 pixels between rows.  Also, I'd left align the column headers, and perhaps even push the icons for those headers out of the left margin a bit.  It's not as bad as the space at the top, but it feels a little off.<p>- The tagline is great, by the way.  ""Create your own private social network blah blah"" is a great, immediately-understood description.  I wouldn't mess with that.<p>- The pricing table should have a 'highlighted' default probably.<p>- The 'About Us' section should probably be relegated to sub-pages.  I don't know what the honest judgement call is, but at least until you've gotten some more traction, my suspicion is that three college sophomores aren't going to be able to provide the most full-time customer service as a 'real' company.  It's impressive to me, but I'm not sure how  most people would feel about it -- might ask somebody other than me.<p>I don't have a need for the service enough to sign up at the moment, so my apologies on only critiquing the homepage.

Putting in features that are solidly understood, that are desirable, and that don't clash with each other make for a simple, solid, nice language.<p>I've tried without success to dig up an email from Linus Torvalds (on the LKML?) where, responding to an email complaining that a particular implementation of ARM does not breaking any interesting ground, he goes on a mini-tirade about the lack of appreciation for a simple thing done well.  I think Go fits the description nicely.",1343355361

In 1987 there weren't the public glimmerings of the fall of communism - the Berlin Wall was torn down in '89.<p>Since the fall of communism ended the two-superpower cold war, industrialised nations simply don't feel the threat of being sucked into a massively destructive third world war.<p>Don't forget also that many of those minds write about things happening in a post-apocalptic timeframe :)",1343355315

4299665,comment,4281803,4281803,1,0,fmw,,,"The consumer market for GNU/Linux desktop application is tough, although there are some niche markets that can be viable. Wikipedia has a list of proprietary GNU/Linux applications that provides several examples[0]. If you want to charge in the consumer market and aren't interested in game development, solving boring, but relatively complicated problems (e.g. tax software) seems like a good bet financially. Open source developers are less likely to sustainably work on boring applications. People that generally prefer free software are also more likely to set aside their principles if you can somehow lessen some kind of significant pain for them (again, like doing taxes).<p>The business market is much more viable. There all sorts of viable markets, like:<p>- compatibility glue for either server-side or client-side open source alternatives to the Microsoft stack that solves certain headaches (e.g. arcane file formats, better conversion for scripted Excel sheets),<p>- GUI (system) management tools (such as CPanel and Plesk for budget webhosting, but for less saturated markets like managing thin-clients or virtual machines that are still a moving target),<p>- hardware + software (e.g. building things like portable barcode scanners for inventory management, security/surveillance hardware or VoIP boxes using the Raspberry Pi),<p>- et cetera.<p>If you target business users open source or dual licensing becomes much more viable too. It isn't economical for most companies to dedicate a lot of resources to IT internally, so they will still pay for e.g. support, training or a managed version of your application. The latter is especially attractive with web applications, of course, because you can sell a managed SaaS version of your application (this is exactly my business model with <a href=""http://www.vixu.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vixu.com</a> [1]).<p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proprietary_software_for_Linux"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_proprietary_software_fo...</a><p>1: Based on an Apache licensed application you can find at <a href=""https://github.com/fmw/vix"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fmw/vix</a>).",1343354879

It's not too difficult to, at a user level, specify a caching artifactory instance to hold these.<p>In practice, as far as I've seen, one should specify the exact versions of the library you're pulling. This is done explicitly in the name of build reproducibility. The ""main"" repositories should be preferred unless something really custom is needed - in which case, you should be running your own package repository with the libraries you need.<p>So I guess more tips for maven:<p>1) Prefer releases over snapshots of libraries whenever possible.<p>2) Consider running an artifact repository if you're working with a large enough team. It's simple enough that it'd speed you up nicely even if your entire project lives on one laptop, if you're comfortable with a few details of running it. This is strictly optional but will make certain team-based workflows smoother.<p>3) Always specify versions manually! Don't set it to use the latest automatically. Is this ever a good idea?<p>4) Try not to include too many third-party repositories if you can.<p>It's not hard to get Maven dependencies under control. The dependencies are also cached locally, so Maven builds should depend on the internet only the very first time their dependency is included, and thereafter, every time they are updated, <i>only for the package that was updated</i>. Maven is actually -very- good at repeatable builds by default.",1343354482

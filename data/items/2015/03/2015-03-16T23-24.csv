That, of course, is very valuable if you presume that knowledge of vulnerabilities would lead to them being closed and fixed.<p>In this particular case, the obscurity seems nonsensical because we know very well how StingRay and IMSI catchers in general operate. The reason the vulnerabilities they exploit are not closed is down to inertia in what is a huge market. That&#x27;s only half of the equation, though; the other side is that while it&#x27;s a huge market, it is dominated by very few big global companies that posess the necessary resources to pursue R&D in this very specialized area of technology. This is an area where every opensource solution is easily 10, 20 years behind if there even is one at all, and they run on hardware the same age.<p>The only curious thing here is why theres been this recent hightened interest in IMSI catchers, as the concept is very old, and why there is a particular interest in obscuring the mode of operation, as again, that is theorethically known. The only explanation I can think of is that advances in hardware have made it possible to produce a small (think truck sized) system that can crack various propietary (and generally old) encryption systems used by mobile phones in realtime and thereby gather more data than you could with an IMSI catcher telling victims to use no encryption. But then with 3G and other systems came improved encryption systems that can certainly not be broken in realtime yet.<p>The only other explanation I can think of is that Harris has deals with various telcos to get the encryption keys beforehand, which would be worth obscuring.<p>There is also a possibility here that I&#x27;m overthinking all of this and the typical defence contractor that is 20 years behind at all times just thinks IMSI catchers are the hot stuff and their IP they need to protect.",1426549327

     // do stuff
  }

This just adds type hints for the scalar types (integer, float, string and boolean).<p>Since PHP has a long tradition of weak typing and this is what PHP&#x27;s built-in and extension functions use, weak is the default behaviour, allowing some conversions:<p><pre><code>  function foo(int $x) {
     var_dump($x);
  }
  foo(&quot;12&quot;); // produces int(12)
  foo(null); // throws an error

But, you can optionally turn on a strict type-checking mode for scalars on a per-file basis, which doesn&#x27;t allow conversions:<p><pre><code>  <?php
  declare(strict_types=1);

Even careful hand-tuning with help from the breqn package can often look pretty bad.<p>> Two commands I used all throughout my thesis are:<p>At the risk of turning this into TeX StackExchange, I just want to point out that these kerning manipulations are entirely possible in MathJax. The problem is that, maddeningly, they chose to have non-math commands like kern and lower work <i>exclusively</i> in math mode, and not outside one like in a hbox. Therefore, if you change your second command to something like this:<p><pre><code>  $a \kern-1em\lower0.4em\hbox{$\scriptstyle \rightarrow$}$
</code></pre>
then it will work in MathJax. Of course, this would then break in regular TeX because you&#x27;re not supposed to use kern and lower in math mode. I keep myself sober by remaining optimistic about a potential overhaul in the MathJax latex processing code.<p>In the meantime, I think we would benefit from a stopgap service that renders these things in an actual TeX engine running on a server into high-res PNG (easy) or SVG (doubtful).

I don&#x27;t get a clear sense of what MY problem is and then how you are solving it.<p>So let&#x27;s say I like to video chat online with my college bound son using Google Hangouts. I am also security and privacy conscious. How do I go from downloading your software to having a chat with my son? By the way, there is not a chance in hell I am going to download your software, hand you my account information, and get my son to do the same thing BEFORE you describe to me how the software works and what benefit I am getting. Give me a simple &quot;walk through&quot; of what you want me to do and why this is going to make my life better and maybe I will. Something like:<p>Google Hangouts are insecure -> government officials/naughty hacker people watch you while you chat on Google Hangouts -> You love privacy and want security -> Downloading Venux is easy -> connect with Venux to Google hangouts makes hangsouts secure! -> Venux secures you and blocks out government officials/naughty hackers!<p>You also make some sensational claims about your security. Mathematically impossible? How do I know? Have you been peer reviewed? Have you been audited? Can I look at how you implement the algorithms? Or should I just hand you my credit card and believe? I am not trying to sound difficult, I just want you to think about how you talk about your product.<p>There is a TON of data on your front page and frankly I get lost in all of it and it doesn&#x27;t really tell me anything I want to know in order to decide if I want to actually download your software. It would take me a while to critique the entire experience. I would suggest simplifying the entire page and giving me a simple path to realizing I have a problem and then showing me that you are the solution.<p>Edit: One other thing I guess I would like to point out is you could, and probably should, niche this thing. For example, look at Tarsnap[0]. The website design won&#x27;t win awards. They aren&#x27;t attempting to market to every person in the world who could use an online backup. I believe it takes a high level of technical prowess to use their product. Yet, they have a very very profitable niche. I am not comparing your product to theirs (though I guess they both have a security component). What I am saying is pretty web site designs don&#x27;t sell products.

Public (on forums or f2f) signaling of the choice you made, with some &#x27;reason&#x27;, lets people support you and your choice.

9215112,comment,9212481,9212481,0,0,zxcvvcxz,,,"Interesting stuff, it&#x27;s clear from this economics perspective that sexual behavior is tightly coupled to risks and societal influence. As birth control became more available, the risk of premarital sex went down dramatically. I think societal norms are slowly catching up with this, hence why &quot;we&quot; (i.e. Western nations) are more liberal now than say 70 years ago.<p>Here&#x27;s a related thought experiment: could ever increasing divorce rates be explained similarly by risk? There is much less risk of divorcing now, women are about as financially independent as men, and it could be argued there is a greater safety net for single parents (e.g. [1]). This is interesting because it would imply that in the natural state of things, men&#x27;s primary family purpose is/was as a provider/protector of some sort. So as that need diminishes, perhaps it shouldn&#x27;t be the norm to expect everyone to get married.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_...</a>",1426547101

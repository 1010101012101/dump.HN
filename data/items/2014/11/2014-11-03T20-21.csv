The restrictions may serve a useful purpose and if you can&#x27;t see it, that doesn&#x27;t mean <i>they</i> are the ones missing the point.<p>Having myself had to pass the export control for one of my apps, and so having the opportunity to pour over the these regulations in great detail, I came to conclusion that the actual purpose of the crypto export regulation is not to control export of the <i>technology</i>. That sort of restrictions is impossible to implement, as you noted, and it&#x27;s also quite unnecessary.<p>The actual purpose of the law is to prevent export of <i>expertise</i>. Implementing a crypto <i>system</i> that would be secure end-to-end is pretty much impossible without being an expert, and even then it&#x27;s exceptionally hard. The best chances belong to a team of experts with a track record of fruitful collaboration and rich history in a particular area. Unlike bits and pieces of code, cohesive teams of experts are relatively easy to keep track of.<p>The way this control regime works, is that the entirety of the regulation revolves around two questions: 1) Are you supplying a turn-key end-to-end system to the client? 2) Are you supplying services to setup  a complete, tailored system for the client? If the answer is &quot;yes&quot; to either question, that raises the red flag for the BIS/NSA, and they want to see what&#x27;s going on there. Otherwise it&#x27;s just a minor bureaucratic hoop to jump through. You are certainly welcome to export bunch of crypto code, and they even have a special open-source exception to the paperwork requirements.<p>So, you may disagree with the goals of this regulation, but it&#x27;s certainly not a joke you make it out to be.",1415047676

Sorry I had to get that out of the way.<p>In all seriousness, &#x27;Semantic Web&#x27; has always felt like a SciFi inspired version of AI intelligence.  A concept that sounds cool, but in reality can&#x27;t ever work.<p>Take movie ratings & &quot;suggested viewings&quot; for example.
Jim, Bob, and Steve all watch the same movie.
Jim thinks it&#x27;s funny because of the physical gags.
Bob thinks it&#x27;s funny because of the dialog & jokes.
Steve likes it because the hot new actress is naked.
Dave likes the director and cinematography.
All 4 guys give it a rating of 4/5.<p>With this one data point Streaming-movie-place.com cannot ever &#x27;guess&#x27; what to suggest to these guys to offer more movies for them to watch.
The hope is that once these guys start watching and rating other films a pattern will emerge.  That pattern can then be marketed and offer valid suggestions.<p>BUT reality is too different.  We like different things for different reasons, and no algorithm can ever get it 100% right.  How many of you have a Netflix queue of things that you want to see, but the suggested movies are full of crappy suggestions?  most or all of us I bet.<p>Which brings me back to my point; it&#x27;s a sci-fi illusion.  It can never exist in real life.  Humans are too damn fickle.  (Which brings me back to KDE; I wish they would give up on neopunk/symantic desktop crap.  it&#x27;s bloated, slows the system down and offers nothing in return.  Or I am just using it wrong.)

The majority of Redbox machines are placed outside of Safeways, Walgreens, Walmarts, 7-Elevens, and so forth. The sort of customer who rents DVDs from these machines is likely to be of lower socioeconomic status than your typical Netflix subscriber. He or she may not have a cable subscription, may not have high-speed internet access [1], and may deem Netflix&#x27;s monthly fee to be too expensive. He or she could be a working-class parent, a college student on a tight budget, or maybe a reasonably affluent professional who, for one reason or another, doesn&#x27;t consume enough entertainment to find Netflix worthwhile. On top of this base, you have a small proportion of ad hoc Redbox usage from people who happen to stop by, see a movie they can&#x27;t get on Netflix, and check it out. And you have a <i>very</i> small proportion of film buffs who prefer the AV quality of physical media, like Blu-Ray.<p>Time will tell how long this strategy will work for Redbox. In their favor: their 36,000 kiosks are placed <i>directly</i> in the footpath of hundreds of millions of shoppers every week. (Walmart alone sees over 100M shoppers per week in the US, and 3,700 Walmart stores have Redbox kiosks). Working against them: broadband penetration, Netflix, Amazon, and the steady transition away from physical media.<p>[1] About a quarter of US households do not have high-speed broadband.

Lets do the math here shall we: What is the mortgage and taxes(thanks prop13) on a place like? Well, at 4.05%, good credit, and 15% down, it&#x27;s 2857.80/month just on the loan, then we have taxes at about 729.16/month and ancillary insurance and repair will round us up to about 4k/month (48k/year) on just housing for a 3 bed 1 bath. Since spending about 1/3 of your income on housing is normal, you&#x27;d need about 150k/year as a couple to afford the house next to my folk&#x27;s. You simply cannot get a job out in Concord for that salary, so you need 2 working people at ~75k, which is just out of Concord&#x27;s range for a young person. The only place you are going to find salary at that price is in the South Bay or the City. So now you have to ride Bart or 680 for an hour each way, putting you at at least 10 hour days. Oh, and the closer you get to SF or the further south you go, the more the houses cost.

One place it surely <i>does</i> differ is that we&#x27;ve quite a few more people on this plane of the economy than on any test flight.  We should, indeed, be correspondingly more careful.<p>That said, &quot;be careful&quot; and &quot;do nothing&quot; are two very different propositions.  Being careful may motivate doing nothing, or it may motivate doing quite a lot.  While I don&#x27;t think it was present in Hayek&#x27;s reasoning, this frequently spills over into something that looks like &quot;We&#x27;re dealing with people&#x27;s lives/rights here! How can you be so crass as to talk about numbers and make decisions?&quot;  When things are difficult and important, that&#x27;s precisely the time you need to be most careful in your reasoning.<p>Abstaining is still an action.

8553195,comment,8552613,8552613,0,0,jcrites,,,"Switching to a standing desk several years ago had a significant positive impact on my stamina and energy level, and probably health overall.<p>I always used to get tired walking around a city, like on vacation. After a few months of standing, I went on vacation to Paris and immediately noticed a gigantic improvement in my standing and walking stamina. I was the last person to get tired, instead of the first. I could walk around a whole day and be fine!<p>Beyond that, there were ergonomic benefits for me. I have always found it difficult to use a computer properly in a chair. I&#x27;d find myself leaning on a hand rest, or on the desk, etc. These postures are more likely to strain the body. I found myself in minor discomfort and thought: &quot;if I&#x27;m going to be doing this job a long time, then I had better find the optimal posture&quot;.<p>The proper posture according to my company&#x27;s ergonomics advisor is: allow your arms to hang limp at your sides; then without moving your elbows, rotate your forearms to bring them up in front of you, parallel to the ground. Your keyboard should be under your hands in this position. Again without moving your elbow, rotate your primary hand outward (staying parallel with the ground). Your mouse should be comfortably reachable with this movement. If you must extend your elbows, reach, etc., then those motions put you at greater risk for stress injury.<p>It is very difficult for me to achieve that posture while sitting in a chair - the keyboard and mouse need to be in your lap, basically. (Try the motions I described while sitting and standing and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.) It was difficult for me to get the right posture while sitting; keyboard trays can do it but are clumsy.<p>Getting the correct posture in a standing desk is easy: make that &quot;arms out front&quot; motion I described. Imagine yourself standing at a counter with your arms just over it. A keyboard sits under your hands. That&#x27;s where the standing desk should be, and getting it right primarily entails selecting the correct height of standing desk. The man in the picture/video in the article seems to be demonstrating this pose.<p>If you work at a computer all day, and likely will for the rest of your life, then you owe it to yourself to get a standing desk. Best office improvement I made in my life. Hope this helps! Happy to discuss further with anyone interested - reach out!",1415045810

By persisting resources in the cache after they are changed on the server there is an implicit promise of broken user experiences, since there is no control over which files are loaded from cache and which ones are not (so even for &quot;harmless&quot; images users will see mismatched artwork in the real world). Whatever caching strategy is used for production servers, it should involve a way to make sure users are fetching the latest version of a resource. The dev server can be configured identically and it will still do the right thing. Admittedly when you throw CDN&#x27;s and other intermediates into the mix it becomes harder to have matching environments, but differences should be minimized as much as possible as a matter of development policy.<p>My dev server is set up identically to a production server, except that no concatenation or minification is done.

It is easy to be dismissive and &quot;blame the suits&quot; or the &quot;bankers&quot; but the reality is much more nuanced than that.<p>I have come to conclude that it depends on what goal is driving the bulk of the community. During a &#x27;non-boom&#x27; the driving force is often engineers and designers who are spending all of their capital on solving a problem, or changing the efficiencies of an existing system to favor a different part of the value chain. You get a lot of folks thinking like that and eventually you get a couple of winners. That winning inspires other engineers to either work around similar spaces to see if they can replicate the success. A &quot;wave&quot; is started, whether it is &quot;microprocessors&quot;, &quot;the web&quot;, or &quot;social media&quot; or any other technology, it generates some success for people who get the value and can plug it into the bigger economy.<p>As that happens it starts generating economic value which gets translated into cash (the thing everyone thinks they understand).<p>That cash then attracts a different kind of person. Someone who can use cash to make more cash, they are meta-engineers if you will, playing off the second derivative of innovation, the change in cash flow over time. Their secret sauce is that they perceive the forces that are changing the cash flow and they speak to non-technically inclined folks about tapping that flow to send some cash their way. Imagine everyone in the world had gone wild for buying tulips, these people come in and find the folks who see people getting rich on buying and selling tulips, but don&#x27;t understand tulips, or the attraction in tulips, and whisper that they know a farm that is growing outstanding tulips and will be harvesting soon.<p>What this other set of people have done, is to start influencing capital toward the &#x27;new thing&#x27; but through their fingers. And they take a cut of course.<p>The truth is though that there has always been (and perhaps always will be) more capital than Silicon Valley can successfully convert into improvements into systems or new solutions to problems. And so this capital sits on the sideline until the third actor in our play arrives.<p>That is the person who is going to &quot;get rich&quot; in Silicon Valley. These people spin stories, stories that sound enticing and world changing. Stories about frictionless sharing or paradigm shifting. Stories about turning opportunity into massive shifts of economic power, political power, or both. They spin the story of changing the world, if only there was someone with the courage and the vision to back them in their quest. And at some point, that capital that is sitting on the sidelines &quot;missing&quot; this opportunity, sets aside the common sense its managers had and starts to make some big bets. Because everyone knows you need a lot of money to make a lot of money.<p>And that is where things have gone off the rails, at least twice before and perhaps now for a third time. Money begins to flow in, it goes to some great people, it sometimes knocks good projects off course, and it goes to some folks who are just good at talking. The the number of &#x27;good&#x27; things that are happening with it, goes down quickly. When the diligence  drops below the minimum sustainable level, the game board is set for some spectacular failures. And those failures are unavoidable, like a train engineer seeing a car on the tracks half a mile away, knowing it takes over a mile to stop the train, even with all wheels locked.<p>While I feel like I&#x27;ve analyzed the dot com crash enough to understand the mechanisms in play, I have yet to figure out any scheme or system which could prevent it from happening.

Where, exactly, is the cutoff point beyond which we&#x27;re no longer allowed to care about human misery?<p>If you want to argue that poverty in India and worldwide is a huge problem, and that the Western world could and should do more to address it, I&#x27;ll agree heartily. But what you <i>said</i> was that poverty in America is not a problem and that poor Americans aren&#x27;t suffering, and that&#x27;s bullshit.",1415044940

For instance just giving your functions proper names (examples 1. GetLongestString 2. StoreReferencesToAllStrings (still hacky, not sure if there are proper usecases for that?) 3. RemoveDuplicates 4.

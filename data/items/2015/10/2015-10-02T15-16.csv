I hate it with a passion, because having lived surrounded by it, I find it to be cold and uninviting, and utterly devoid of charm.

&quot;If we see terrorism as more of a tribal or gang activity than political activism or warfare, then online connections become especially important to our analysis, otherwise we will be fooled by so-called lone wolves. Earlier ‘lone wolves’ like bombers Timothy McVeigh or Eric Robert Rudolph turn out on closer inspection to have ties, social & otherwise, to like-minded people; McVeigh lived with several other extremists and was taught his bomb-making skills by the Nichols, who also built the final bomb with him, while Rudolph remained on the run for several years in a community that wrote songs and sold t-shirts to praise him and was ultimately caught clean-shaven & wearing new sneakers. Lone wolves who genuinely had no contact with their confreres, such as Ted Kaczynski, are vanishingly rare exceptions among the dozens of thousands of terrorist attacks in the 20th century, and as rare exceptions, otherwise implausible explanations like mental disease account for them without trouble.&quot;",1443800951

&quot;Assuming you are using Git, that means every developer you employ is running around with a complete repository history of your source code on their laptop.

I think you have a great idea. Several things I would work on:<p>1. Expand your market. If I remember correctly, you are only in Toronto. Start on-boarding venues in other areas.<p>2. Work on establishing partnerships with the venues that you can offer discounts if the customer books through your site, even if you don&#x27;t handle the actual booking.<p>3. Partner with every possible event planner, wedding planner, convention planner, trade show host, etc... that you can possibly find.<p>4. I wouldn&#x27;t put all my eggs in one basket though with #3. In a way you are actually competing against these folks. They already have vast amounts of data on every venue, and most likely have existing relationships established with them. You really want to target the individual, self planner market. One angle may be to go to churches and advertise in bulletins. Go to flower shops and talk to the people there. Hit other vendors and work with them.<p>5. I would work on building in additional planning features. So not only list the venues, but list other services that are nearby or have worked with that venue in the past. For example, if someone is looking at a hotel for a wedding, include options for florists and caterers. Try to create packages for the consumer, that way you are a one-stop shop and allows you to compete against the event planner more effectively.<p>6. Find an event writer at local papers and try to get them to run a story about the site/service.<p>On another note, I am not clear on your revenue model. Are you charging the venue to be listed, do you get a referral fee, do you charge the individual for something, is there an ad model? The revenue model you envision for the site may or may not impact some of the choices you make for marketing the site.<p>Anyway, I like the idea and think your site looks great.",1443800684

Most often they are seeking some kind of enterprise customizability: &quot;workflow&quot;, survey skip logic, custom reports, white labeling, etc.---basically the same places where you risk falling into the Inner Platform Effect trap. I&#x27;m curious how other people tackle requests for these. Usually it starts out with something basic (&quot;email the admin if it&#x27;s two weeks late&quot;,  &quot;skip this page if they answer that way&quot;, &quot;use the most-recently entered birthday to compute age in years and months&quot;, &quot;let people change the logo&quot;), but I can see where it&#x27;s going.<p>It seems to me you can either field these requests as they come in and get a hodge-podge of strangely-interacting features, or you can build some kind of general-purpose scriptability from the start. (Or you can follow the iPhone and 37 Signals and do it one way only, but often that is not an option.) So I&#x27;ve started to wonder about simply embedding a Javascript interpreter with access to a well-defined API into your application objects. Then people can do whatever they want! Of course this assumes savvy users, perhaps 90% an internal &quot;services&quot; team.

The US banks optimized for check processing and credit cards, while the Euro banks optimized for bank transfers.  Domestic bank transfers typically cost around $25-35 a pop and take several days to clear in the US.  Checks usually post instantly but take about as long to clear - the time between it posting and clearing is basically a loan, and the check may still bounce.

The Turkish flag, as the flag of the Ottoman Empire, flew over the Armenian, Assyrian, and Greek genocides.

10318967,comment,10302879,10302879,0,0,Pyppe,,,"In scala-land, I&#x27;ve got experience from Scalatra, http4s and Play framework. We&#x27;ve recently migrated a large Scala project from Scalatra to http4s. I would not recommend using the current 2.x version of Scalatra. The biggest issue I&#x27;ve got with it is it&#x27;s lack of type-safety. Each REST-endpoint in Scalatra is basically a function from Request to Any. So you can return anything and cross your fingers it works runtime (see e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/issues/534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/issues/534</a>). I believe many of the core Scalatra-contributors are nowaday much more active in development of the http4s (see <a href=""https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/graphs/contributors</a> vs <a href=""https://github.com/http4s/http4s/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/http4s/http4s/graphs/contributors</a>).<p>I really like the design of http4s; services compose really nicely -- each service/server is just a partial function from Request to Response. It utilizes Scalaz Tasks for asynchronous opeartions / streaming. On the other hand, I would not consider http4s very mature yet. We&#x27;ve encountered some issues during refactoring from Scalatra to http4s. Also, they offer support for both Servlet- and Blaze NIO -servers, but I&#x27;ve had the feeling that Servlet-support feels a bit like second-class citizen. Maybe not so thoroughly tested (I&#x27;m just spitballing here)? But still.. I like it and based on current experience would not advice against using it. Also, I&#x27;ve had great help from their Gitter-channel. :)<p>Play framework, is nowadays pretty mature. I&#x27;ve used it in multiple projects, and love that nowadays it&#x27;s sbt compatible (just declare the dependencies) -- I think in the past you had to download a separate distribution for using it.<p>I think http4s and Play are both excellent choices. Play feels a bit bloatish and maybe opionated compared to http4s, but on the other you&#x27;ve got everything ready (play-ws, play-json, play-twirl etc.). Once http4s gets a bit more mature, I believe it&#x27;ll be awesome! :)<p>P.S. With http4s my current recommendation would be: Argonaut for JSON, and Slick for RDMS-support (Postgres all the way).",1443798074

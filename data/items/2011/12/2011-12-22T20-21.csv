We're really going to accept ""it was easy"" and ""I didn't feel like exuding effort"" as excuses when GoDaddy has a well documented history of screwing business owners over?

Please, help me understand this. The ""rage"" here is that SOPA will effectively yield DNS censorship in the United States. GoDaddy has, on more than one occasion, taken it upon themselves to censor the DNS of domains for the entire world, yet I am crucified for pointing out that THAT alone is worthy of ditching them as a registrar?

(Perhaps based on which universities are actually using them?)<p>Personally, I find that the research literature is usually (intentionally or unintentionally) opaque and that most ideas worth learning are at least 5 years old, so textbooks are the best place to actually learn things from a source intended to teach you the material.<p>The list I could actually vouch for would be:<p><pre><code>  CLRS
  Russell and Norvig
  Introduction to IR (Manning et al)
  Database Systems: The Complete Book

Others that I've heard good things about are:<p><pre><code>  Dragon Book
  Convex Optimization (Boyd)
  Probabilistic Robotics
  Foundations of Statistical NLP

If we only look post-hoc, we might come up with entirely irrelevant patterns, for example finding differences in the amount of time successful bodybuilders spend socializing or watching TV or the number of herbal supplements they take or the kinds of houses they live in, &c. when compared to the general public.<p>Anyhow, Im not arguing that we shouldnt try to do ethnographic and historical analyses (my father is an anthropologist/historian!), only that we need to be cautious and skeptical of our conclusions.",1324586121

The Earth/Moon system should really be classified as two planets in essentially the same orbit around the Sun.<p>As I think was discussed recently in another thread here, and was pointed out by Isaac Asimov in one of his science essays a long time ago, if you were to plot the paths of the Earth and Moon through space, you'd find they are both approximately 12-sided convex polygons around the Sun, out of phase by pi/12. The Moon's path does not look like something a kid would draw with a Spirograph, contrary to popular opinion.<p>When you look at moons of other planets, their paths do look like a Spirograph drawing.<p>If you are having trouble visualizing this, imagine two horses racing around a standard horse racing track. On the first straightaway imagine horse 1 is in the lead. At the first turn, horse 2 gets the inside track and pulls ahead. On the back straightaway, horse 2 leads, but on the second turn, horse 1 gets the inside track and takes the lead back in the turn.<p>It probably wouldn't even occur to you to think of horse 2 as having done an orbit around horse 1, yet if there were a remote control camera mounted on horse 1, and you were controlling it from the stands and you were trying to keep horse 2 in view at all times, you'd find that you have had to rotate the camera around a full circle. So, from horse 1's frame of reference, horse 2 indeed did orbit it once!<p>Now imagine the horses on a modified track that instead of two straightaways and two half-circle turns has four straightaways and four quarter-circle turns. Now horse 1 thinks horse 2 circled it twice.<p>That's essentially what the Earth and Moon are doing, but there are 24 turns in the race course, and the straightaways are not there--as soon as you leave one turn you are starting the next. So, from Earth's point of view it looks like the Moon goes around us 12 times a year. But alien astronomers watching would be like spectators at the horse race--they'd just see two planets orbiting the Sun in nearly the same order, taking turns using the inside track to pull ahead.<p>Another way to look at it is to consider force ratios. For moons such as those of Mars, or Jupiter, or Saturn, and so on, if you look at the force on the moon from the planet, and the force on it from the Sun, you find the ratio of those two is greater than 1. The planet ""pulls harder"" than the Sun does.<p>For the Earth and Moon, the ratio is less than 1. The Sun is pulling harder on the Moon than the Earth is!",1324584022

Nobody wants IT experiments that magnify these numbers.<p>Another more feeling perspective is that in healthcare, errors cause real harm to individuals that you see and care for on a daily basis. Most errors can be attributable at least partially to a specific human that care for the patient.

If they do, that&#x27;s great. But if you&#x27;re hiring someone fresh out of school, you&#x27;ve got to be approaching it as hiring someone that you&#x27;re going to train and mentor. For me, the number one thing I look for in a junior developer is the ability to <i>learn</i>.<p>Here&#x27;s an example from early in my own career. I was just finishing up my 3rd year of a combined CS/EE program, and looking for a summer job. I got in touch with a biology lab that needed a developer for the summer to build some (very cool) software to support the neurophysiology experiments they were doing. I looked at the job requirements and thought &quot;well, I don&#x27;t know most of this stuff, but I&#x27;m sure I could pick it up.&quot;<p>The interview progressed like this:<p>> Do you know Python?<p>I&#x27;d heard about it, but have no real experience with it. I downloaded it last week and started playing with it though, and it doesn&#x27;t seem too different than other languages I&#x27;ve used.<p>> How about VisionEgg (neurophysiology module for Python)?<p>Well, I downloaded it at the same time I downloaded Python. I&#x27;ve managed to get a window to open up, and I&#x27;m displaying a square that&#x27;s got a cool animated habituation pattern on it. (Note: 1 week prior, I had no idea what a habituation pattern was) I do have a bit of OpenGL experience from a class I took, and that&#x27;s the underlying library that VisionEgg uses.<p>> Well, so far, you&#x27;re the only applicant who has actually made an effort to look at the specific tools we&#x27;re using here. I&#x27;ve got one other applicant coming this afternoon, but unless they somehow have more experience with these tools than you do, the job is yours.<p>It turned out to be a great experience, and they hired me back on the following summer. I went from being a total Python noob to contributing patches back into VisionEgg. I think most junior positions should probably progress like that. Give me a keen junior developer, and let me shape and mould them into a not-junior developer.<p>The flip side to this: if you&#x27;re expecting the person to be productive on day 1 or 2, you&#x27;d better be hiring someone with experience. Whether or not they have code they can show you, they should be more than capable of going into serious detail about past projects they&#x27;ve worked on (within the confines of NDAs and such, of course).",1426992889

9245348,comment,9245043,9245294,0,0,m_mueller,,,"> IMHO &quot;pass-by-reference&quot; means you can mutate the attributes of the thing passed (as in java when you pass an object) and also means you can be operating on a &quot;volatile&quot; area of memory, meaning another thread can CHANGE the data while the function is executing.<p>Sorry, but having an &#x27;opinion&#x27; about such definitions doesn&#x27;t help. Just [use the definition](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#cite_note-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#cite_note-1</a>). This clearly states what the article tried to explain with helpful examples.<p>> If you tell me that passing an integer and passing an object are both the same thing (pass-by-value) in Java, then I will tell you that pass-by-value and pass-by-reference are not very useful concepts.<p>They are useful, just not in the way that you think of them. You <i>could</i> use these definitions to have a meaning in terms of side-effects, but <i>only</i> if you design your objects accordingly, i.e. there are no exposed methods to do an in-place change of your object&#x27;s data, instead you only have class functions that return a new object and read-only accessor methods. Combining this with a language that is strictly pass-by-value (such as Java and a subset of C++ without reference parameters) should make your program side-effect free.",1426992799

In Java, you can&#x27;t dereference a pointer to an Object and get some sort of Object value. Similarly, you can&#x27;t perform an &quot;address of&quot; operation on a primitive value and get a pointer to that value. Similarly, you can&#x27;t pass-by-reference (in the sense of the parent article) or do pointer arithmetic in Java.<p>While Java technically has pointers (in the sense that it has pointer types), it has dulled them so that you can&#x27;t hurt yourself with them the same way that C (and C++) permit.",1426992755

9245340,comment,9244574,9245140,0,0,eutectic,,,"This a common misconception. Partial application is like taking f(x, y) = x + y and turning it into f(y) = 1 + y by supplying x = 1. Currying is like taking the same function and turning it into (f(x))(y) = x + y. Expressing f as a higher-order single argument function in this way gives us the advantages of partial application using normal total application.<p>A good example is the derivative function from calculus, which could be specified in at least two obvious ways. A simple, but ugly solution is to have it take a function and a point as arguments and return the value of the derivative at that point.<p>Alternatively, it could take a function and return its derivative as a function, which could then be evaluated at many different points.<p>This is the difference between e.g.<p>(Float -> Float, Float) -> Float, and\n(Float -> Float) -> (Float -> Float).<p>Taking this idea to its logical conclusion and applying it to any multiple argument function gives you currying.",1426992673

Not crazy, like others, about the &quot;OS&quot;.<p>That said, I think that, as far as revolutionizing elections/politics in any important sense, something far more drastic than this will be required.  Finding new ways to debate hot political questions of the day, as a function of what is coming out of the news (any news outlet), is missing the point.<p>There is a lack of disengagement with politics, and moreover, it is absolutely justified.  The manner in which most of the discussions are conducted are nonsensical.  There is an abject lack of nuance and thoughtfulness.  Discussions are necessarily vague and always conducted with superlative certainty.<p>Here is a fact:  there is not enough information on this page[1] to form a reasoned opinion about the Bank on Student Loan Fairness Act.  There probably isn&#x27;t enough information on 20 pages.  Yet that is the script.  Learn about a complex issue in 60 seconds, and then decide where you come down on it.  It&#x27;s patent nonsense.<p>If there is to be a revolution, it will need to deal with the reality that there is a facade between the machinations of governments and corporations and the people, and that facade is the news.  The news is our window into vast, vast complexity and the basis for making choices that supposedly affect our local quality of life all the way up to the direction of history.  So long as the important decisions are organized in this top-down hierarchy of power, a website isn&#x27;t going to change much.<p>No, the most promising ideas about upending hierarchies try to actually redistribute the power from the top.  Imagine a politician running for office in the context of some website like this, who, through some formal, public process, granted certain levels of access to online advocates, in the event of a win.  For example, someone able to marshal something in the order of 10 votes would be promised one lunch in the first 2 years.<p>The details are less important than the inversion of power hierarchies that new technologies enable.  Until that can be practically harnessed, approaching electoral matters along conventional axes is unlikely to get much traction.<p>[1]<a href=""http://demo.democracyos.org/law/54766690be6cbe0c0023e08f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.democracyos.org/law/54766690be6cbe0c0023e08f</a>",1426992063

Developmental delays in social interaction and language surface prior to age 3 years.<p>* Autism is a disorder that is usually diagnosed in early childhood. The main signs and symptoms of autism involve communication, social interactions and repetitive behaviors. Children with autism might have problems talking with you, or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them. They may spend a lot of time putting things in order before they can pay attention, or they may say the same sentence again and again to calm themselves down. They often seem to be in their &quot;own world.&quot;because people with autism can have very different features or symptoms, health care providers think of autism as a &quot;spectrum&quot; disorder. asperger syndrome is a milder version of the disorder.the cause of autism is not known.

A lazy sequence is a sequence who&#x27;s elements are only generated when they&#x27;re asked for.<p>In Clojure, a sequence (seq) is a list datastructure. It can be traditional Lisp list, an array, or some other datastructure who&#x27;s items are arrayed in an ordered sequence. You can generally treat a sequence like you can treat and array or a list in other languages accessing any element by its index, (except that it&#x27;s immutable, of course.) Clojure doesn&#x27;t traverse the sequence via &#x27;next&#x27; unless the particular sequence type (ie a Lisp style list) is implemented to do it that way.<p>A lazy sequence is a special kind of sequence which is implemented with a sort of &#x27;cons&#x27; structure where the &#x27;cdr&#x27; is a function to be called rather than a pointer. To clarify, in a traditional Lisp, a list is implement with a series of pairs of pointers called &#x27;cons&#x27; cells. The first pointer is called the &#x27;car&#x27; and it pointed to the content at that point in the list and the second pointer is called &#x27;cdr&#x27; and it points to the next pair. A lazy sequence is similar except the that the pointer to the next pair is rather a function which returns the next pair. This means you can have a sequence who&#x27;s actual data is not yet fulfilled. When you access an element in a lazy sequence, that element and every element before will be generated (and cached). Unless you access an element in that sequence, that element will never be generated.<p>This lets you have things like infinite datastructures or do something like wrap a stream in a sequence and loop over it like it was an array.<p>BTW, if your day job is with JS, maybe you can squeeze in a a ClojureScript app on a small project? I&#x27;ve done this.",1426991289

Since I have a Jewish background, I knew of some of the things they told me about the Talmud, but I had never seen the Talmud. It was very interesting. It’s got big pages, and in a little square in the corner of the page is the original Talmud, and then in a sort of L-shaped margin, all around this square, are commentaries written by different people. The Talmud has evolved, and everything has been discussed again and again, all very carefully, in a medieval kind of reasoning. I think the commentaries were shut down around the thirteen– or fourteen– or fifteen-hundreds—there hasn’t been any modern commentary. The Talmud is a wonderful book, a great, big potpourri of things: trivial questions, and difficult questions—for example, problems of teachers, and how to teach—and then some trivia again, and so on. The students told me that the Talmud was never translated, something I thought was curious, since the book is so valuable,<p>> One day, two or three of the young rabbis came to me and said, “We realize that we can’t study to be rabbis in the modern world without knowing something about science, so we’d like to ask you some questions.”<p>> Of course there are thousands of places to find out about science, and Columbia University was right near there, but I wanted to know what kinds of questions they were interested in.<p>> They said, “Well, for instance, is electricity fire?”\n“No,” I said, “but… what is the problem?”<p>> They said, “In the Talmud it says you’re not supposed to make fire on a Saturday, so our question is, can we use electrical things on Saturdays?”<p>> I was shocked. They weren’t interested in science at all! The only way science was influencing their lives was so they might be able to interpret better the Talmud! They weren’t interested in the world outside, in natural phenomena; they were only interested in resolving some question brought up in the Talmud.",1426991158

The spots can also be exchanged for &quot;popular support&quot; with labor union leaders (to herd people into political rallies).<p>So, here the &quot;congressman&quot; have no direct relation to the voters, they&#x27;ve only a direct dependency on the &quot;leader&quot;. They do as they&#x27;re told or else they will not be included in the list on the next elections.<p><i>There is no such thing as &quot;constituents&quot; in this system.</i><p>That&#x27;s a reason why DemocracyOS and the &quot;Net Party&quot; are viable here. <i>When representation is completely broken, direct-democracy sounds good</i>.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from a document on Paraguayan system (the same system):<p>&quot;But what if the elected representatives of the legislature were not voted in directly by the people? Would that discredit the authority of the legislative branch? The actual voting method in Paraguayan politics for a legislator to enter government is to lobby for their name to enter a “lista sabana,” a list of names on a sheet that represents the party candidates. The people then vote for that party list, rather than for the individual. Party leaders can then decide which positions to give to the party faithful. In this way the political class can make deals, play at back room politics to add their name to the list, exchange favors with voters and backers, and conduct business behind closed doors. The Congress can then vote to apportion more funds from the Treasury to fund their election campaigns, increase their salaries and benefits, and buy their votes with political largesse. The system reinforces the worst excesses of political cronyism, including links to crony capitalism. Ultimately it erodes the social trust between the governed and the governors and creates inefficiencies in a country’s economics. Attempts have been made to remove, or “unblock,” the “lista sabana” by allowing voters to choose individual candidates to the legislature, but so far these attempts have failed.&quot;",1426990750

Functional programming has no built-in notion of time; conceptually, the time a pure function takes to run must not have any effect on correctness, or replacing a function call with its value would have side-effects. To allow time to pass in a way that matters for correctness, you need callbacks, and monadic types are a form of callback-based programming. In a single-threaded program, the goal is for functions to execute as quickly as possible so that the user doesn&#x27;t notice pauses, so the solutions end up being similar.<p>So these are not implementation tricks; they&#x27;re fundamental to the theory of how programs execute. Erlang is built on callbacks as well since each event results in another function call.<p>Goroutines and blocking function calls are fundamentally different. Blocking function calls need to return at the right time or it&#x27;s a bug.",1426990246

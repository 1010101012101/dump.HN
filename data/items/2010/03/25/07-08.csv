Reminds me of an essay that a friend of a friend (who I do not know personally and would probably have long arguments with if I did) wrote about how Facebook was bringing us a better world because when your life is public you are forced to discover your ""true self"" as opposed to adapting your personality to whoever you communicate with. The devious man who happens to know both of us sent me that essay and sent him (the author of the essay) my essay about the evils of Facebook from the point of view of a non-user (<a href=""http://everything2.com/title/Facebook+destroys+real+relationships"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everything2.com/title/Facebook+destroys+real+relation...</a>) and then attempted to synthesize the two views, with what I consider insufficient success.",1269503980

1217943,comment,1217839,1217839,0,0,barrkel,,,"I have an iPod Touch and a Nexus One in front of me now. When looked at side by side, the Touch seems drab and fuzzy and the grid layout of the pixels stands out; while the N1 is crisp, and the white background of text is solid.<p>The thing it reminds me of most is a comparison between a CRT and an LCD. Apple seems to like applying more anti-aliasing to their fonts, certainly more than is customary on Windows, and it really shows on the Touch - whatever about the N1 having slightly fuzzy text when zoomed well out, the Touch's text is plainly fuzzy when zoomed to normal reading size.<p>Things other folks have brought up, like 18-bit with dithering vs 16-bit, I'm less concerned with. There's more contrast range in that 16 bits (by itself enough to make banding more obvious), while dithering doesn't strictly relate to the pixels displayed on screen and can be done in software. I expect updates can improve this.<p>The Cooliris Gallery browser the N1 ships with certainly does scale down photos before drawing them on screen; the browser is similar. This is annoying, especially if you want to zoom into a section on the photo, but again it's not related to the actual display. It looks more like an optimization designed to fit the image into a texture for hardware acceleration. Other photo gallery apps don't necessarily have the same implementation (e.g. B&B Gallery).<p>One actual aspect of the OLED display that does bother me somewhat is the way it ""fizzes"". When using the screen in the dark with the brightness at the lowest setting, all lit areas of the screen can be seen to be constantly flickering and alternating between different brightness levels at very high speed, a bit like the way the head of a freshly poured Coke's froth is constantly dissipating and getting renewed. But this is a very minor quibble.<p>As to contrast ratio with bright ambient light, I haven't found it to be a practical problem. I don't use my phone much outside during the day - even if I'm using the map, I'm more likely to be doing that in an evening - but even then, it seldom gets sunny enough in the UK to make the screen hard to read when it's at full brightness.",1269503484

I did something which gave you a reasonable belief that I wouldn't sue you, and<p>2. That was the only reason you went ahead and did it, then<p>3. I don't get to turn around and go after you, because it was really <i>my</i> actions which created the situation.<p>In a laches defense, you show that the person suing you for patent infringement knew you were doing or were going to do something which infringed, and deliberately waited to come forward with their claims so as to do the most possible damage to you. You argue that, had you known about their claims earlier, you would have done something different, and so it was their inaction which led to the current situation.<p>This doesn't stop the patent holder from going after <i>other</i> people, so long as they do it in a timely manner; the patent is still valid and can still be enforced. It also doesn't automatically stop future claims against you; it's expected, now that you're aware of their patent, that you'll work out some licensing deal to avoid future infringement. But it can throw out their current case against you, or at least throw out the massive back damages you'd owe from infringement over the period when the patent holder didn't bother doing anything.",1269502759

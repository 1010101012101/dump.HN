6630410,comment,6627710,6630242,7,0,thatswrong0,,,"Yep, there are a ton of huge / game-breaking bugs. But it did take quite a while (10+ years) and a lot of people to find many of them. The fact that people really love to speed run the game certainly was a huge factor in finding these subtle bugs, not to mention technology like emulators really accelerated the process, especially when it came to finding, for example, the correct frame to leave Gohma&#x27;s room for the wrong-warp to Ganon&#x27;s castle (it&#x27;s a frame perfect trick). I would imagine that most games made at the time, if subjected to the same level of scrutiny, would display near or the same level of brokenness. Donkey Kong 64 certainly comes to mind. I don&#x27;t think this is indicative of inexperienced programmers.<p>And then we have to think of the system limitations at the time and the fact that the N64 was a pretty new system with a new way of displaying graphics. It was a pretty big paradigm shift and yes, for the first 3D Zelda game it, like all games, could have benefitted from more time.<p>A lot of the bugs with the game have to do with messing with memory and exploiting pointer arithmetic. Using pointer manipulation to handle cutscene / area changes as well as items on the C-buttons obviously isn&#x27;t ideal but sure as hell saved space compared to alternative solutions. There is very little error checking (for buffer overflows and &#x27;impossible&#x27; situations such as having a deku stick on &#x27;B&#x27;) for what I would imagine to be performance concerns as well as simply good time management.<p>To your point, absolutely. Very few people for the first few years encountered any such bugs. The first real speed run of the game came in 2003, 5 years after its release. Even that run featured very few bugs; it was mostly route optimization and practice. The latest wrong warp glitch which enables you to jump from Deku Tree to Ganon&#x27;s Castle was found in 2012. That&#x27;s a full 14 years after the game&#x27;s release.<p>If anything, this speaks more to the dedication of speed runners and glitch finders that the incompetency of OoT programmers.",1383000910

6630388,comment,6627329,6627708,5,0,saalweachter,,,"The phrase &quot;10,000 lux&quot; is making me twitch.  Lights emit <i>lumens</i>, <i>lux</i> is <i>lumens per square meter</i>.  In other words, lumens is the measure of how bright a light is, and lux is the measure of how well a room is illuminated.<p>So what these devices are claiming is that if you use them as prescribed (sitting 18-24 inches away) you (specifically, your face) will be illuminated at 10,000 lux.  If they&#x27;re just illuminating a little 30 cm square, they could be doing it with as little as 900 lumens of light.<p>To achieve 10,000 lux, you need 10,000 lumens per meter of area you are trying to light.  The easiest way to do this is probably to 4 foot long 40 watt fluorescent bulbs.  You can buy 4-bulb fixtures, which will emit a combined 12,000 lumens and consume a total of 160 watts.  Probably cost you about $50, bulbs and fixture.  So for a to light a 10 square meter room, you need 10 4-bulb fixtures, 1600 watts, and $500.",1383000658

I can see how getting older makes people more conservative, or at least susceptible to conservative thinking - I on the other hand am becoming more of a anarchic Marxist.  Not because such ideologies are achievable in the real world, but because the utility of their theory sheds light on the bad side of capitalism and Western society that gets swept under the carpet (cue Noam Chomsky soundbite...)  I just wish &quot;conservatives&quot; would live up to their lofty ever so repeated ideals, instead of being the utter hypocrites they are (along with the liberal hypocrites)<p>To create a anarcho-socialist Marxist paradise, or even a libertarian one, the members of the community would have to be spiritually advanced enough such that non-parts of the community (i.e. government and regulations, etc) wouldn&#x27;t be needed to step in to maintain balance - the system (community of people) would be self-regulating.  Libertarians like to think they&#x27;d be self-regulating, but how many of them slavishly bow to the God (invisible hand) of the market?  The market won&#x27;t regulate human emotions, like greed and fear - the market is very easily manipulated by the sociopathic as the last few years have shown.  Libertarianism could not have done jack to correct what they have wrought lately.  Perhaps society is too big now - a small libertarian community might be achievable, but humanity is too interconnected now.<p>I recently read some stuff on behavioral economics - it looks like economists are wising up and realizing most non-economists are not sociopaths, unlike them.  So a proper understanding of economics requires an understanding of human psychology and how it, and especially psychopathology, are primary factors in economic systems.  I just spent the last 4 years of my life being manipulated by a bona fide sociopath, who manipulated me into building him a company, then forced me out just as money actually started rolling in... so take that into account when evaluating my current stance.<p>It is said engineers don&#x27;t really begin to understand that non-engineers don&#x27;t think like engineers until their 30s - I can certainly attest to that.  Or maybe I&#x27;m just more autistic or whatnot.  But after I dropped acid for the first time I started to grok how working as a US DoD defense contractor was a waste of time.  If all the engineers working for the industrial-military complex said &quot;fuck you&quot;, what would happen?  You think politicians have any useful skills?  The problem with engineers is that we are so enamored of thinking up and building stuff, that asking ourselves &quot;why are the larger, more nebulous consequences of this? How are the people in charge going to profit from this?&quot; gets lost sometimes - IT is addictive in some sense, or at least that mode of thinking.<p>So to wrap up this essay, which didn&#x27;t start out as one (I am just winging it), speeches like the one mentioned in the article are fine as exhortations to try and improve society, but to opt out entirely is not going to work unless that new society that is created figures out how to deal with the dark side of humanity - the greed, the sociopaths, and the garden variety drama that goes on between people (even engineers).  To do that is going to require an understanding of empathy, and a better understanding of humankind (in a spiritual sense) that I wouldn&#x27;t expect the average 20 something person in IT to grasp.  Right now regulation of society is supposed to be the purpose of government, but it is now obvious the hypocrisy, inefficiency, and stupidity is too much to ignore anymore.  But you can&#x27;t get rid of government until you solve the problems it is supposed to regulate.  Perhaps governments, or other such things like feudalism, are instead an emergent property of a system? An emergent property based on factors like the psychological relationship between individuals, which is defined by social customs and other anthropological like things?<p>To ask one&#x27;s self &quot;who is John Galt?&quot; is a good thing, but you also have to remember Galt was creating a community and that relationships between people shouldn&#x27;t be based on economics.  It always seems to get lost in the noise that one aspect of John Galt&#x27;s society was that it would be populated by people with integrity, not the rent seeking parasites living off of income from capital gains. You can&#x27;t live with integrity if you are primarily concerned with maximizing your economic status, because that, in theory, requires you to act like a sociopath.<p>The first step I would propose instead would be to figure out how to ensure manipulative authoritarians are not elected to high office and how to weed out the sociopathic from high finance (hell, all of society entirely).

I don&#x27;t think that is enough to consider that &quot;git has won&quot;. There are big projects and big companies that use mercurial instead of git (e.g. Mozilla, Python, Facebook). Both git and mercurial are great and both can (and probably will) coexist for the foreseeable future.<p>If you only read proggit or HN you could think that everybody uses git. The reality is that there are many teams that use mercurial. There are many, many teams that are still using old style non distributed VCS. There are lots of teams that don&#x27;t even use any VCS at all!<p>There are lots of people (myself included) who consider that git is needlessly complex, and that mercurial hits a better trade off between power and complexity. A lot of teams would be much better served by using mercurial instead of git. I know for example of several HW design teams that decided to use mercurial because they found it much easier to use.<p>In addition, I don&#x27;t think that git or mercurial, as they currently stand, are the best we can do on a DVCS. There are plenty of areas where they both can improve (submodules / subrepos being one of them, but also better support for code review workflows, simpler / safer history rewriting, etc). Perhaps something else will come that will learn from git&#x27;s and mercurial&#x27;s mistakes and improve on what they offer?<p>What I mean by this small rant is that it would be foolish to consider that git has &quot;won&quot; and that there is nothing that can come and improve on it. I hope that the git devs don&#x27;t think that way.

It is maybe just a means to an end, that is conceivable (although unlikely, in my view).<p>I think the way to go in instances like these is just to engage specifically only on the points presented by the author -- not raise suspicions about their motives. Incidentally I think in this case the evidence points to the contrary: I think his motives are good. I actually happen to be concerned about capitalism in much a way Umair is, and I can promise you that I have good motives: I want my childhood friends (who I know are not doing well, they&#x27;re living in poverty) to be doing well, in many respects I see them as victims of the current system. If I were to write a long piece of political commentary, criticizing the current system, I know that it would hurt me to be labeled as an &quot;attention-seeker&quot;. I would, on the other hand, welcome any and all responses that go directly at my arguments.",1382998863

Journalists IMO should strive for neutrality and distance (knowing they will never attain it), particularly distance from the culture, nation and media which they were born to. They should question the narratives (often delivered pre-made), and use of words they are given in a press release, not relay it, and they should make clear their own biases to readers, at the same time as striving to see the situation from various points of view, not only their own, or the one they were brought up with. They should strive for this this because it brings empathy and understanding, in a way that completely ignoring neutrality and picking a side in often polarised conflicts does not. It is impossible not to have sympathies, but journalists should also try to put their sympathies to one side at least until they have a good picture of the facts on the ground and can form an opinion.<p>In the example you give, we have lots of terms for the participants in asymmetric warfare, all employed to taint debate before it starts:<p>liberators, freedom fighters, rebels, guerrilla fighters, insurgents, terrorists<p>IMO the acronym or name chosen by the fighters/armies themselves would be best in each case, rather than a label dreamed up by the military which opposes them - it also stops lazy reporting which groups disparate groups together as one enemy.<p>I&#x27;d rather news didn&#x27;t have a pre-decided viewpoint/agenda which they try to cut the facts to fit, which is often what partial news or &#x27;op-ed&#x27; turns out to be when written by professional columnists. We should not have a liberal view or a right-wing view, we should have journalists who approach each story with an open spirit and actually do the journalism required to come up with an informed opinion and transmit that.

6630194,comment,6629298,6629966,3,0,cromwellian,,,">Non sequitur. The notion of economic growth is tied to environmental and human labor exploitation, at fundamental levels.<p>Umm, no, that&#x27;s not a non-sequitur. Our measurements of economic growth are mathematically tied to gross domestic product, whose definition doesn&#x27;t demand anything about what that product is. The fact is, GDP is a human concept, not based on objective physical quantities in the real world, but on human demands and how we value them.<p>>A large portion of any nation&#x27;s GDP comes from mining, pumping oil, cutting forests for crops, and activities that produce a lot of waste, on which the rest of the economy relies on. Another large portion comes from the financial sector, which profits on the disparity of income by providing credit. These activities are only profitable because the environmental and social costs are externalized. Without that, other endeavors wouldn&#x27;t even make sense cost-wise, making economic growth grind to a halt.<p>That&#x27;s what the current mix is, but there is nothing fundamental in the definition of GDP that would prohibit a society from which the majority of value is not derived from steady-state or virtual goods once all basic requirements of civilization are taken care of.<p>Also, the implication that all profit in the system has come about externalities aren&#x27;t accounted is unsupportable. I&#x27;d like to see your calculation on this, showing that the enormous profits gains in productivity over the entire industrial and green revolutions are cancelled out by these external costs.<p>>I realize many people think like that, and it&#x27;s a fallacy. Capitalism is not some sort of natural law, it&#x27;s entirely arbitrary human invention, and in practice it&#x27;s nothing like this pure, theoretical meritocracy that allows the best solutions to strive. Quite the contrary: it fails to address many concrete, contemporary problems, like ever increasing economic disparity, social welfare, research funding and environmental destruction. And don&#x27;t come tell me it&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t have enough capitalism, that markets are not free enough... this is the same argument used to explain why communism failed (it wasn&#x27;t pure enough). If we keep looking at it as some theoretical ideal, we will never tackle it&#x27;s shortcomings in practice.<p>You just proved my point. I said capitalism is like an ecosystem, you say it&#x27;s a fallacy, but then go on to say it&#x27;s not addressing disparity, welfare, environmental destruction, but nature ecosystems don&#x27;t address these either.

It was generated because millions of people saved a few dollars on airfare. Some of those savings went to the capitalist, but they can&#x27;t all have: His price then wouldn&#x27;t be any better than the friendly travel agent down the street. The rest of those savings stayed with the consumer, who can now afford that much more air travel or that many more organic carrots or whatever.

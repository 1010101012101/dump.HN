That is very refreshing after all this MBA BS in the mainstream media.<p>As an investor, however, PS and Co is not a very good fit for vast majority of engineers because... because they give you only what... 5K per founder? That is much less than good engineer's one month salary after-taxes. That limits his investments to trivial weekend projects completed by fresh college grads. It's the investment side of PG, that the blog post is bitching about.

22337,comment,22248,22248,0,0,Harj,,,"What I find most amusing about this is guy is how he so passionately bashes Y Combinator on his blog, Techcrunch and probably any other form of medium he can get his hands on.  Each time he argues how YC is worthless and irrelevant.  The problem being that if YC is so irrelevant and pointless - why spend so much of your time and energy writing about it?  I know my general approach to things I think are a waste of time is putting them to the side and spending my time on the things that are in my opinion.  Since I value my time as a scarce resource I think that's a justified approach.<p>The logical assumption then is either:<p>1) ""Livingfirstlife"" doesn't actually consider YC to be so pointless as presumably if he genuinely believed that to be true, he wouldn't be so generous as to provide a stream of free PR.<p>2) He doesn't value his time particularly highly, in which case he's not exactly the type of person I'll be asking for startup advice anytime soon.<p>Perhaps one day he'll learn that childish tantrums aren't the most effective method for convincing people your point of view is correct.",1179261714

Put another way- what this forum should be is a place where news is discussed and people provide encouragement and help to other founders.  People here should be judged on how they help others, and the reasons they give for their advice.<p>What this has become-- since you have clearly stated that you judge applications based on how people act here-- is an ideological garden where people are judged based on how closely it is percieved that their statements are in line with the Party Line. <p>For instance, there are many ways you can fund a startup- credit cards or house equity being two that are more viable now that you don't need to raise millions.  But because its percieved by your fans that ""Venture Capital"" is the only way to go, any suggestions to the contrary are met with derision.   This is ironic given that you yourself have argued for venture capital being less important now days. <p>So, even your ideas are considered ""trolling"" in this forum ... because ideological purity is a good that you have put forth explicitly.",1179261662

If there's anyone who'd claim that joining YCombinator is a stupid idea, it'd be those who were actually put through the process.<p>However, I do have to say, that being rejected from YC and being an outside observer, I do at times feel that YC itself seems to get a bit 'clubby.' One big reason for this feeling comes straight out of pure envy and jealousy for wanting to be a YC member. The other reason deals with the fact that I feel as if the connections/information gained through such a program are ones that no one on the outside has access to. So it's either you're in and you're connected, or you're out and left in the dark.",1179261444

You obviously can't replicate your experience and time for the world to share in, but are there bits and pieces that could be spun out and made into templates to help those who aren't lucky enough to be able to apply/win a spot.  Specifically, I'm thinking creation of the company itself, but perhaps there are other things.<p>Just some random thoughts...

22324,comment,22248,22309,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""The problem is that success makes other people feel bad""<p>It's more that success attracts attention, some fraction of attention will always be negative, and the haters tend to scream louder than the likers.  I'm still a loyal GMail user, I still visit Reddit frequently, and (despite some quibbles and a rejection) I generally think YCombinator's done a lot of good for the startup community.  But you don't hear from folks like me often: we're happy, the software does what we want it to, so we have little reason to speak up.  Folks with a gripe, however, are willing to put countless hours into venting their spleen.<p>That was one of the reasons I left FictionAlley (a non-profit Harry Potter fanfiction archive).  99% of users were very appreciative of what we did.  However, 1% were not, and the 1% took up about 80% of our time and attention.  When you're not being paid for your work (FA was all-volunteer), 80% is far too much time to spend on people with massive entitlement complexes.<p>(There's perhaps a lesson for prospective founders here: build anything worth visiting, and people <i>will</i> hate you for it.  Not a lot, and not nearly as many as it seems, but you better be prepared for it and willing to put it in perspective.)<p>The latest fad in business now seems to be ""fire your customers"" - get rid of the 1% that soaks up 80% of your attention, so you can better serve the 99% that actually appreciate what you do.  I dunno if that's applicable to YC; probably not, since they ""fire"" 95% of their customers simply through lack of resources and the haters come from the people who're not doing business with them anyways.

And right now the winds are not favorable for these startups, but because the winds were in that direction 10 years ago, everyone's convinced that's the only direction the winds blow. <p>Look at the vitreol I've gotten for pointing out that in fact the winds have changed... people don't want to believe it.<p>10 years from now, when the US is no longer the dominant place for innovation--- the major growth in innovation elsewhere will have already occured.   One would have missed the trend if they waited.   <p>Plus, small startups should not waste money using the old models- they are the ones who can least afford it.<p>The really cool startups-- right now-- are relocating to former eastern republics.

That's cult-of-personality thinking.  It invovles the fallacious argument ""appeal to authority"". <p>If I told you I was Tony Robbins and I was a multi-millionaire., would that sway you?

I've never posted to reddit.

Unfortunately this is not sufficient, as simply having a differnet opinion is the problem here, and the result is that people make insinuations on the persons character because they have a differnet opinion-- as I called you on and as you have not yet withdrawn, despite being more conciliatory in this message.<p>Or put another way- the problem is people are offended at someone having a differnet opinion.

My analogy does work, but I wasn't talking aobut YC, I was talking about VC.

22310,comment,22289,22289,0,0,paul,,,"I'm still not buying unless a valuation is attached (his option four). Here is my reasoning:<p>Many startups are interested in using a convertible note for their early funding. I've heard three reasons:<p>   1. It's less paperwork than preferred stock<p>   2. VCs would rather do a Series-A than a Series-B (one solution is to name this first round ""Series-Seed"")<p>   3. It lets them avoid having to determine a valuation<p>
The first two reasons seem fine to me, assuming that they are true. The third reason is bad.<p>These convertible notes typically convert into preferred stock upon the next major financing (presumably the Series-A led by some VC), usually at some discount to what the VC pays (perhaps 20%). Sometimes there is a cap on this conversion price. If that cap would be a reasonable pre-money valuation today, then third reason doesn't really apply, since a valuation was in fact determined.<p>However, if there is no cap on the conversion price, or that cap is very high, then you are asking investors to give you money today, but not giving them the upside between now and then next major funding (which probably won't occur for another 6 - 12 months). During this 6-12 months you will build and hopefully launch a product and begin to prove it's market potential, or not. That's a lot of uncertainty.<p>Put another way, I'd rather wait 6-12 months to see what you build, how successful it is, and how well your team executes, and then decide whether or not to invest. And I'd gladly pay an extra 30%. However, if you need the money today, then it needs to be at today's valuation, not next year's.",1179259414

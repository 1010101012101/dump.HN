My wife's driving history isn't pristine, and she pays <$1k per annum for car insurance. Maintenance is simple enough in California as it's warm enough, too. Though we are married now so the price should come down even further.<p>3) What kind of vacations could we be looking given the income and living expenses?<p>That's a loaded question -- apples to oranges and such. My version of a vacation is a road trip somewhere with the wife (e.g. grand canyon) and most of those can be had for a car rental & $500-1,000.<p>Travel is relatively inexpensive in the U.S. -- you can often fly somewhere for $100 anywhere in the continental U.S. as long as you book properly in advance. Better yet, Hawaii & Puerto Rico are accessible, and as long as your visa is alright so is most of Central America / South America at reasonable prices.<p>Even local doesn't hurt either, I'm preferential to road trips myself and there's the great state of California to explore -- and Oregon / Washington not too far.<p>4) Will we be able to have nights out, go to a sporting event every once in a while etc?<p>Can't see any reason why not. Even a night out once a week wouldn't be difficult to have, esp. in light of them offering you $2k in housing assistance.<p>>> Basically, will a $90K salary for a household of two in SV/San Jose force us to carefully set up a budget, or will we be able to not worry too much about money?

For a long time I was ill.  My family was horribly poor when I was growing up, so the only doctors I saw were in state run institutions.  Paranoia meant I never shared the reality I experienced, instead I only shared enough to get a mild ""well, he's a teenager"".  I barely held on to sanity for a good number of years, eventually ending up where other's lives depended on me, so I sought help.  I went through all manner of diagnoses and medications.  The common side effect was that of, well, making my brain slow.  Things that used to be easy, weren't anymore.  I eventually found a doctor who ran a  wide battery of tests with the end result being, if I read on an institution, he could have used those tests to keep me there.  The final diagnosis was schizotypal personality disorder.  Along came a battery of more medication, worse with the new diagnosis.<p>These new medications did wonders, but in addition to being slow, I was a foreign person to myself.  And I kinda didn't like some aspects of that guy.  So, with the help of the doctor, I went off my medication and developed new coping techniques.  It's been 8 years, I've had some bad days and some good, I've got some odd habits, but unless someone watches me for a period of time, they wouldn't even notice.<p>All this to say, mental illness is a real illness, it's almost always manageable, but without the cooperation of the ill, there is no fixing it.  And at the same time, the well person may be completely foreign, making the experience even more traumatic.  Someone in the thread asked if folks would hire someone who said they were ill in an interview, but were being treated.  I see the question as would you hire someone with only one leg.

But that same professional, if paid $30K/yr, is required to be paid overtime for excess hours worked, even if that person is on salary. One case is treated as appropriate for free choice by the parties without overriding restrictions; the other is not. And the difference, in this case, turns on the amount of salary paid - the highly-paid worker is treated as being able to protect his own interests while the relatively low-paid worker is not.""<p>According to this (and my memory) salary vs. hourly relates to the type of job and duties, and, yes the amount paid.

3643591,comment,3642106,3642106,3,0,justinhj,,,"I have worked at game development companies for nearly 20 years. Initially I worked a lot of overtime for free,but after a couple of years I started to feel the effects on my life. After that I mostly just did not do OT unless it was paid. One year on a badly run project I doubled my salary through OT pay, and though my life outside work was not good I was able to put a significant amount of money aside. The following year hourly OT pay was gone, but the expectations were not. I made it clear I would only do OT on rare occasions, such as my work falling behind and a colleague being dependent on it at the weekend, when he would be working and I would be having a life. Even this caused resentment and I had to do the walk of shame at 5pm every day, and I was laid off as soon as the game shipped. The sense of personal failure was very hard on me at the time, but 12 years down the line, I've had a successful career in games, while being upfront at the hiring stage about my attitude to OT. I have worked a handful of weekend days and never later than 8pm in the week. I didn't miss my son growing up, and I read him a bedtime story every night. I don't think this is possible for every programmer and every company, but you can make it work.",1330444999

If you make something good and charge fairly for it, someone else will make a lower quality version & sell it cheaper and people will start expecting you to match that price without dropping any quality. The problem with software is that you often can't see the corners that have been cut until much later than with physical products (where you might have a chance of spotting the shoddy workmanship before you hand over any money), so competing on quality can be difficult (the competition can make the same quality claims as you can, whether they be true or not) meaning you end up having to compete on features.",1330444896

Someone who is working long hours, <i>is</i> working hard. They may not be working smart, but they are working hard.<p>Now, the rest of your post addresses why working overtime may not be beneficial to your goals. This does not fundamentally contradict grellas's point that the US model is based around the theory that skilled professionals should have the choice and that they have the knowledge and power to exercise that choice. In the US, if you don't want to work 100 hours a week -- or don't think it's productive -- you can quit. There may be some problems with this view but I don't see any convincing arguments against it in your post.<p>Lastly, I would like to echo tptaceck's comment that grellas is always informative, helpful, and exceedingly polite.

I am interested in Jolla, but not as convinced about them being truly open as Mozilla is etc, they need to convince me better of their real motives and philosophy. Google have become very clear, now that they have decided to close almost everything on Android, no more SMS app, Google Now baked into the launcher, everything is G+ now, gallery app is on deathwatch. I feel like a peasant to Google, while they battle with the OEMs, Samsung, carriers, social networks etc they simply force feed their services down users throats, there is little point having an Android phone if you do not want to live 100% Google.

It’s a fun way to make sure everyone is off their phone without seeming like an imposing ass.<p>If what keeps people from checking their phone is the threat of having to foot an expensive bill, it&#x27;s not so much a society of phone zombies, but a society of people with no self control.",1385830638

I already know what it will do to my brain, because I spend all day at my computer, and it&#x27;s a constant struggle to not waste time on the Internet. (Most of my best work has been done on pen and paper while taking a walk.)<p>Even when I&#x27;m not working, I like being disconnected. It gives me a chance to reflect on my life. Where I am, where I want to be. Ideas I have. I find it difficult to produce anything of value to myself or others when I am too busy consuming stuff through my screens.<p>I think the worst part of smartphones are the cameras. I had an epiphany one day at some aquarium in NJ. The aquarium was mediocre, certainly nothing worth taking pictures of. But yet every group of people had to take videos of the fish, had to pose with the fish with their friends, etc (who knows why, those people will never view those videos ever).<p>Of course all of this picture taking took so long that people got bored. Why not, they couldn&#x27;t see the fish, after all. So of course, everyone got on their phones and goofed off, which made the crowds even MORE sluggish, which made the whole affair take longer, and which made the aquarium experience even more boring.<p>I think that if phones were banned at the aquarium people would have gotten in and out more quickly, seen more fish, and had more fun. It&#x27;s ironic that the smartphone--which is supposed to be whiz-bang-wow-entertainment-whenever-you-need-it--contributed heavily to making the aquarium experience boring for everyone.<p>Sorry to ramble!

6823600,comment,6822882,6823489,4,0,tks2103,,,"Infrastructure is very complicated.<p>Typically if you have a guy build a road and you let that guy control the pricing, he charges a lot because he has a monopoly. That transfers wealth to the road builder at the expense of all the would-be businessmen who would build institutions that use the road.<p>So societies use governments to control a relationship between the manager of the road and the people that use the road. The price to use the road dips because of the enhanced bargaining power of the people that use the road through the institution of government. Typically governments even subsidize the unit cost of using the road by paying the road manager directly up front, because the corresponding increase in business is worth it across a society.<p>I think that if you have a system that focuses on individuals and their relationships to roads and road builders without regulation by a large third party that represents all members of the society, you&#x27;ll get a situation where the road builder uses the monopoly power to price road usage so highly that business investment is hampered. Usually people use government institutions to manage this sort of thing, and usually it works pretty good.<p>I think this is pretty basic stuff, no?",1385830275

I&#x27;m interested in peoples&#x27; critical thought, since we as a loose community often take an investigative/contrarian approach to assumed best practices.  It seems many of us are acutely aware of herd mentality, collusion and corruption when it comes to the combination of tech subjects, the media and government/societal norms.<p>Personally, I am for vaccination.  I&#x27;m way over vaccinated due to trips to third world countries -- sometimes I would get 6 shots over 2 days.  However the spacing for vaccinations in infants seems rushed, and the ingredients are something I wouldn&#x27;t let my kid touch or eat. (kind of like how you wouldn&#x27;t feed your kid honey until after they&#x27;re one)  I recently told our doctor we wanted an ingredient list of the vaccines they were planning to administer, so we could attempt to understand, before following their schedule in ignorance.  I definitely don&#x27;t want my kid to have the diseases our grand parents grew up with, and that means vaccinating.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if a doctor would balk at signing a document of liability for {x} resulting from vaccination. If she wouldn&#x27;t put her career behind her belief, should I believe her?<p>Does herd immunity require herd mentality?

The direct reading also reduces latency found in some other cluster implementations where you <i>only</i> have the option to proxy your requests.

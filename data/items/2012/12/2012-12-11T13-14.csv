People are just mobile enough to stratify in their 20s (ambitious people move to the star cities) but not enough to render location obsolete outright.<p>In the Bay Area and New York, you have a continuous/liquid job market. If you're a startup that needs to hire a Scala expert with knowledge of 3 specific NoSQL databases, and you need to hire that person in two weeks, you can find such a person in the Bay Area, for a price. In Minneapolis, there are a lot of talented people, sure, but there isn't the critical mass that allows you to have ridiculous AND-ing in your requirement query. The same goes in job searching. You might have to choose between your location and your speciality.<p>The appeal of the star cities is the continuous, liquid market. For build-to-flip startups that grow rapidly and reallocate huge amounts of money without doing much, the second-tier cities just aren't an option.",1355234322

4904491,story,,,1,2,eze,"Suggest to HN: Build a standalone watch phone supporting tethering",,"Since many smart, entrepreneurial folks read HN, and in view of PG's take on the current hardware renaissance [1], I humbly propose an idea that may have been unduly overlooked.<p>I understand and share the excitement over the upcoming Pebble [2] and the welcome attitude toward less satisfying smartwatches in the market. However, the only downside is that the setup is backwards: you essentially never leave your wristwatch at home, but on many occasions you may feel like leaving your phone. It would be great if the SIM card belonged in your phone, and could tether from there as needed. Yes, most of the time you will have your phone/phablet/tablet with you, and probably a WiFi connection, for that matter.<p>The closest device I have come across is the VEGA (-Z1) watch [3], which is downright ugly, quite pricey ($425), only offers USB tethering with poor support [4], all of this under an old version of Android. (This would arguably be the least significant point.)<p>I think the greatest usage barrier to this is the idea of using your phone for conversations, while all your shiny phones become tablets (unless you want two lines...).<p>OK, that's my proposal. What do you people think? Will this be the standard setup within 10 years?<p>Cheers!<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.paulgraham.com/hw.html

But curious for insights. A large part of it is lack of pickup in iAds overall (our clients do their ad spend on Google and Facebook). We've built a tonne of augmented reality apps with 3D, that are situational and often not meant to become part of a users routine. These should be perfect to be done as ads, to save the user downloading the app. But then we're paying for every usage, on top of the app's development cost.<p>Other thoughts on why we haven't seen more great native 3D iAds?

Rents might go up more than your investments and leave you needing to look elsewhere but if you have bought it you have a secure tenancy (subject to mortgage conditions).<p>I think you are very right about a large delta being a signal of an unsustainable market though.

Infact while you are out of US, that time period is also not counted towards your H1B time left.<p>One last thing, go to a immigration lawyer (generally they charge $100 per hour) and discuss with them, it will give you the most authentic information about how to go around this situation.<p>Worst case, go back to your origin country and do a startup ;).",1355233743

    1: (0, 3777)   -- '3777' is a random number

    2: (0, 4786)   -- '4786' is a correct MAC(key, 2||0)

Your full message is transmitted as plain text bits + authentication tag, intermixed with opposite bits + random data.

However, in the case of a music video, the video and the song are separate entities, so to avoid the license question the parody would have to change the music as well. I'm not sure where the line is, but for example, the ""Opan Chomsky Style"" line in the MIT video would certainly not be enough to make the song a parody. ""Mitt Romney Style"" would certainly be considered a fair use parody and since the video was also parody, the need to license was avoided.<p>It would be interesting to know at which point a video soundtrack becomes separately copyrighted video. Does the process and order of creation matter or is a song a separate work by definition? Is it possible to merge video and music rights into one right?",1355233332

   Junk Food, a ""content for humans"" production company, proudly announces 8bit Generation.

   This forthcoming 12 hours documentary series is divided in two main stories covering the birth of the personal computer and videogame era: each story will be 6 hours and 6 episodes long, starting from the mid 70's all the way through the 80's and the first 16bit machines.  

   With something like 50 (and more to be added) original and unreleased interviews to the fathers of the modern world, 8bit Generation is going to be, by far, the most complete, accurate and the biggest video product on retro gaming and retro computing for years to come.

   Interviews feature Apple founder Steve Wozniak, Commodore founder Jack Tramiel, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, tv game inventor Ralph Baer and many others.

   8bit Generation is going to be released worldwide February 8th 2012 in DVD/BD format and in 5 (plus 1) different packages.

4201204,comment,4199917,4201026,1,0,genbattle,,,"For big data sets or complex SIMD algorithms the I/O bandwidth  overhead is tiny compared to the speedup achieved by moving the calculation to the GPU.<p>For the calculations that don't work well on the GPU due to small data sets, simple calculations, or bandwidth constraints we could just run the code in parallel across multiple cores/multiple goroutines.<p>I think eventually (and this seems to be the direction companies like AMD are headed in) we'll have a couple (maybe up to 4) big cores right next to a bunch of smaller whimpy GPU-like cores which handle SIMD, making SIMD on big cores all but redundant. We're not there yet but AMD and Intel are both working on trying to get their on-chip GPUs to share memory with the processor directly. At the moment the focus for this is mainly gaming performance, so textures, etc. don't have to be copied from main memory to the GPU; the same functionality will greatly benefit GPGPU though. Once we have this heterogeneous architecture and newer faster memory technologies, the problems with using the GPU for SIMD will disappear.<p>But for the moment, with the real-world technology constraints we have, you're absolutely right on the limitations of GPGPU.",1341446240

This is true even if no one else in the world has to read my code. This is the entire rationale of version control in the first place! But if I can do it just on my own individual changes, that means I can go back to a closer savepoint and not have to play the whole level over again if I screw up ;)<p>> Well, if a commit allows me to have a local history of changes that I may not want to have in the remote repository, why do I need to stage my changes? Why don't I just commit them and be done with that? Isn't the files themselves a stagind area? Isn't this all redundant?<p>No, because you <i>still</i> don't always want to commit every change you've made or every new file you've added!<p>Maybe you want to commit while you have Vim open but you don't want to add a bunch of garbage .swp files to your repo. Maybe you did two or three different things that aren't related, so you want them to show up as two or three different commits in the history.<p>From the perspective of a Subversion or Perforce user, it's not something you really think about because it's not even an option that you have. You effectively don't even have version control on your own machine. Your company has version control, but you don't. And in my personal experience as a Subversion or Perforce user, I frequently feel lost at sea in that environment because it's virtually impossible for me to reliably do things like:<p>1. Get back to a working state newer than the one I checked out of the repository after making lots of changes everywhere.<p>2. Make completely unrelated code changes at the same time without mixing the changes together. Maybe one change is blocking on a code review. Maybe I found an unrelated bug and want to fix it separately from whatever other changes I'm making. Maybe I'm second-guessing a certain feature addition and want to put it on ice while I do other things. Maybe someone reported a bug and I want to fix it separately from what I happen to be working on at the time. Whatever the reason, it can live in its own branch and I can come back to it later. I don't have to create duplicate workspaces in my file system, Git just manages it for me.<p>3. Turn a large, complicated code change into a series of smaller changes, each with its own diff and description which I can review more easily.<p>These are things I do <i>every day</i>. I would do them if I shared my code with a small team or with the entire world. I would do them if I shared my code with no one at all. Git isn't just for large distributed projects. It's for decoupling version control from version sharing or version verification.<p>In practice, the purpose of something like Subversion or Perforce isn't to help you as a programmer, it's to help the canonical owner of the code you're working on to do certain things, like rollback to past versions or make policies that your code has to pass code review or something before you can ""check it in"". Git handles all that too--some of it more effectively--and it has the added feature that even you the programmer can get the benefits of version control, too.<p>> No tutorial that I can remember does this. Not a single one.<p>The purpose of a tutorial is to help someone learn how to use Git. If you're not interested in learning how to use Git, why are you reading tutorials? It would be much easier to just start a flame war on Hacker News and wait for someone knowledgable to respond. I guess you figured that out yourself.",1341444735

I lost about 3 hours to those.<p>The second step is to change the order of S3 GETs and adjust the parallelization of those; I think I can easily cut that from the ~20 hours it took down to ~5 hours.<p>The third step is to parallelize the third (replaying of log entries on a machine-specific basis) stage; that should cut from ~10 hours down to ~1 hour given a sufficiently hefty EC2 instance.<p>After that it's a question of profiling and experimenting.  I'm sure the second stage can be sped up considerably, but I don't know exactly where the bottleneck is right now.

Litigating bogus patents is one thing, but this grandstanding about the impact of tiny features is sickening.  Especially after we had the ruling from Posner that it has to be the specific feature in question that is causing the ""irreparable"" harm.  It seems to me that the irreparable harm is drastically tilted in Google's direction here, as they are unable to market the latest version of their operating system, potentially for months until iOS6 is released. Compare that to the tiny (non-existent?) lost sales on Apple's side - supposedly due to customers saying ""hey, since Google's phone can search for apps and contacts on the same screen, I'm buying that one!"" - of their nearly obsolete iPhone4s, it seems ridiculously unfair to me.",1341444644

4201134,comment,4200947,4201074,7,0,bigiain,,,"Seems to me that keeping an EC2 instance spun up and idle might become a sensible approach for people who run downtime-sensitive apps with a single AWS region architecture. A lot of recent outages have been exacerbated for many people by the flood of control plane traffic and contention for new instances - at some stage paying for enough idle instances (which might be just one) spread over availability zones to allow you to at least have some chance of surviving an entire datacenter going dark has to be at least worth running the numbers on.<p>I also predict the control plane contention problem is going to get worse - I'm sure I'm not the only one working on a system to spin up and grab a few extra instances as soon as my monitoring detects the beginnings of a problem. It seems to be ""the right thing"" to do is start spinning up and configuring replacement instances immediately you suspect a problem - even if it turns out not to be a problem most of the time, when it _is_ a problem at least you're well ahead in the queue of the people who chose to wait 5 or 10 mins on the assumption that perhaps it's only a temporary network glitch.<p>(And there's a weird negative incentive for Amazon here. If they fail to address the poor heavy load performance of the control plane/management console/provisioning api, they may end up with more money in their pockets from people keeping spare idle instances or provisioning additional instances speculatively at the first sign of trouble.)",1341444560

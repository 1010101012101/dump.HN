The purpose of financial markets is to provide liquidity, hedging and information to people actually producing products. The financial markets tell us that GM deserves no further capital while Apple does. This increases market returns by allocating resources towards productive investments and away from bad ones.<p>As for ROI decreasing as more money is invested, so what? As more money is invested in the market, it chases more marginal investments. Thus, total returns / total invested goes down. What's your point?<p>Incidentally, hedging has a <i>cost</i>. That's not the same as saying the net effect is a loss. By that logic, all trade is a net loss due to transaction costs. Like all trade, hedging exploits comparative advantage. If I have a comparative advantage in making widgets and you have one in risk management, and our comparative advantages exceed transaction costs, we have a net gain.",1245278617

I have now had to extend my contract for an additional 2 years two times before, and will again.<p>For the device that I want, I have absolutely no options except for this 1 carrier. This isn't about a contract, its about repeat iPhone customers being handcuffed, bent over, and a line of prisoners playing ""shower time"" behind you.<p>Its acceptable if you get a 2 year contract that gives you a subsidized phone for free. Those phones cost next to nothing to build and the carrier quickly recoups the cost within the first couple months.<p>The iPhone is different though. You aren't getting the unit for free. You're paying $200(or more) PLUS the 2 year contract. Also, iPhone users pay AT&T more per month. I'm paying about $110 per month for 900 measly minutes, 200 text messages, and ""unlimited"" data. I haven't yet capped out my phone, but with the bandwidth capabilities of the new phone that's very possible.<p>The iPhone makes it much, much easier to use data and text messages, so its really easy to go over those limits. If I use my 900 minutes? $0.40 PER FREAKING MINUTE. Is AT&T INSANE?<p>AT&T is making thousands of dollars per year, per customer on the iPhone. And they have signed up millions of new ones in the last couple of years. They are literally sleeping in multiple beds of money at this point.<p>Finally, they should keep the phone prices as low as possible ($200 is a great price point) for both new and returning customers. The main reason is that their exclusivity contract with Apple runs out in a couple years. They need to be getting as many of us to sign up for new 2 year contracts as possible before we have other options.<p>They are trying to be greedy in the short-term at the expense of their long-term health.",1245277538

I can go to Vegas with 1000$ bet on black and have a 48% chance to look like I ""beat the market"" but I could have also lost money.  You can change the type of risk you are talking in roulette but a 90% chance of winning 1000$ involves a ~10% chance of losing 10,000$.  This still sums to a negative number even if it looks like a great bet most of the time.<p>Investing is normally a positive return over time.  But, if you are willing to lose a lot of money 5% of the time you can probably make it look like you invested well.  The risk is still there, but it normally looks like you are ""beating the market"" even though you are just placing bets.<p>(This ignores actually producing a product or exploiting insider information.

The company is too big for a single, rational, human owner to comprehensively supervise, and meanwhile there are legions of middle managers who want to increase their relative importance in the company by having more direct and indirect reports.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a conspiracy to keep control over the lives of others, although there are probably a lot of pathological managers who would be motivated by that that. I think it has more to do with unintended consequences. What Graeber is arguing is essentially a conspiracy theory, and it shares the same weakness of every conspiracy theory, which is that it underestimates just how bad things can get purely out of unintended consequences. Managing large organizations is <i>hard</i>. The difference between doing it right and doing it poorly is literally what creates and destroys most large fortunes. And even if you do it well, you&#x27;re going to get some inefficiencies that smaller organizations just don&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s essentially a scaling problem.<p>Haven&#x27;t you ever wondered why companies lay people off when they&#x27;re in trouble? You&#x27;d think they wouldn&#x27;t hire someone in the first place unless they were pretty sure that hiring that person would somehow contribute to improved profitability, and if it turned out that they didn&#x27;t do so, they would just be fired in the normal course of their work. No, aside from redundancies created by merger and acquisitions, layoffs are a means of clearing out these backlogs of bullshit jobs.",1419807178

So then if you want to show (e.g.) that he answers prayers, all you have to do is to argue that answering prayers is more perfect than ignoring them.<p>Descartes gives a kinda-ontological argument for the existence of God, and then he does indeed very rapidly move to deducing useful properties of God from it -- e.g., that he wouldn&#x27;t allow us to be systematically deceived about everything. It&#x27;s the basis of his whole epistemology, at least ostensibly.<p>Whereas, say, a first-cause argument tells you there&#x27;s something that&#x27;s in some sense the cause or origin of the universe, but you&#x27;ve got a whole lot of work to do to get from there to <i>anything</i> relevant to actual religious belief. (Though, e.g., William Lane Craig does somehow manage to keep a straight face when transitioning at lightning speed from &quot;something caused the universe to begin to exist&quot; to &quot;and that something must be personal, enormously powerful, etc.)<p>(Lest I be misunderstood, I&#x27;ll add that I think both ontological and cosmological arguments fail badly, and that neither of them either manages to give much reason to believe in a maximally perfect being / first cause / whatever, or to believe that such a being if it existed would have anything much to do with the gods of traditional religions. But it&#x27;s not my purpose to litigate any of those claims here -- Goedel&#x27;s argument is much more interesting than any I&#x27;d make.)",1419806932

CN at times T1, T2, ... TN is worth<p><pre><code>  C1 * exp(-r * T1) + C2 * exp(-r * T2) + ... + CN * exp(-r * TN)\n</code></pre>\nIn particular, N can be infinite, so that the value of a never-ending stream of payments is<p><pre><code>  C1 * exp(-r * T1) + C2 * exp(-r * T2) + ...\n</code></pre>\nwhich can sum to a finite value. For example, if all the C&#x27;s are constant, and T1 = 1 year, T2 = 2 years etc, then the present value is<p><pre><code>    C * exp(-r) + C * exp(-2r) + C * exp(-3r) + ...\n  = C * (exp(-r) + exp(-2r) + exp(-3r) + ...)\n  = C * exp(-r) / (1 - exp(-r))\n</code></pre>\nso, for example, if C = $1,000 and r = 4%, then the value of this infinite stream of payments is about $24,500 - so if you had to lend more than $24,500 for a 4% consol paying $1,000 you would be getting a bad deal.<p>This is before taking account of the possibility of default, which means that what you thought was an infinite payment stream turns out to be quite finite.<p>Right now, when interest rates are low, a 4% consol looks like a great deal.

Yes.<p>There&#x27;s another very-slightly-similar inverted ontological argument that may have been in the back of my head. It&#x27;s due to a chap called Douglas Gasking, and it begins with a standard ontological argument -- which, as you know, delivers us a Maximally Excellent Being. Now, of course God&#x27;s signature accomplishment is the creation of the universe; but any creative achievement is more impressive when it is accomplished under greater constraints (so, e.g., while it is impressive to come up with a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem it would be even more impressive to come up with a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem <i>in the form of a perfect Shakespearean sonnet</i>). Well, what would be the most impressive obstacle for God to have overcome when creating the world? His own total nonexistence, obviously. So our maximally impressive being must be a god who created the universe <i>without existing</i>; therefore God does not exist.<p>I have to confess that I like mine better.",1419806137

Which is strange because to my knowledge no other probiotic has these traits.<p>The product is also different from an FMT in several important ways:<p>- It does not contain poop<p>- The current version contains 115 strains, whereas an FMT has around 1200 strains in the US (and around 1400 strains in Europe).<p>- The current version contains 1 billion CFU, whereas an FMT (depending on type) is around 1 trillion CFU.<p>These differences are because we were cautious with strain selection, because we didn&#x27;t think it was cost effective to provide strains already very likely to be present, and because we wanted something suitable for daily use.<p>(As a side note, ancestral microbial intake was ~1.8 billion daily CFU and modern intake is ~1 <i>million</i> CFU, so some sort of supplementation or change in diet for most people seems needed to me)<p>Okay, I think that summarizes the big differences.

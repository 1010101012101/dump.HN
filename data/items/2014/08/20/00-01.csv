At the end of the day, most of the work going into libcontainer is all about making containerization totally transparent to the app and supporting a wide range of Linux platform features. These are obviously key features of Docker and useful to many other uses of containers, but simply not a goal for us. E.g. I see selinux and apparmor mentioned in libcontainer&#x27;s code, but Sandstorm&#x27;s security model does not need nor want them. For our case, a couple dozen syscalls to set up our container is really all we need.

The technological solution shall be reversible, so that if an authorized user obtains possession of the smartphone after the essential features of the smartphone have been rendered inoperable, the operation of those essential features can be restored by an authorized user.&quot;<p>And section 2.2:<p>&quot;An authorized user of a smartphone may affirmatively elect to disable or opt-out of enabling the technological solution at any time. However, the physical acts necessary to disable or opt-out of enabling the technological solution may only be performed by the authorized user or a person specifically selected by the authorized user to disable or opt-out of enabling the technological solution.&quot;<p>And Section 1.g:<p>&quot;As a result, the technological solution should be able to withstand a hard reset or operating system downgrade, come preequipped, and the default setting of the solution shall be to prompt the consumer to enable the solution during the initial device setup. Consumers should have the option to affirmatively elect to disable this protection, but it must be clear to the consumer that the function the consumer is electing to disable is intended to prevent the unauthorized use of the device.&quot;<p>Personally, as long as those things are both true and implemented correctly I don&#x27;t see any reason to argue. If disabling it on the phone doesn&#x27;t work, everybody with those phones could sue the company making them (If they live in CA...). Outside of CA, they could legally sell phones with kill-switches inside with no disable option, but that&#x27;s legal to do right now anyway so this law wouldn&#x27;t change that. And, seeing as in CA it&#x27;d be illegal to sell them without the disable option, I don&#x27;t see why they would spend the extra money to design a version without a disable to sell outside of CA, so it probably wouldn&#x27;t change things much.",1408493238

I&#x27;ve considered writing GUI software in Go, but at this point I think it would be a mistake given that most, if not all, GUI bindings in Go (and please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) are considered experimental or alpha quality. In theory this will mean the author&#x27;s progress will be somewhat dependent on the go-qml project, and may involve fixing bugs upstream.<p>If it were me, I would probably choose another language just based on the maturity of Go&#x27;s current GUI bindings.",1408493011

There&#x27;s nothing about REST that encourages missing this point, although there may be something about the common tutorial-type material which tends to focus on simple examples where, unlike most non-toy applications, this is not the case and the important entities are <i>not</i> actions.<p>But that&#x27;s because they are examples of implementing REST, not examples of domain modelling for complex application domains.<p>> But REST has only a few verbs which kind of hobbles your ability for expression.<p><i>HTTP</i> (if not extending it, which without very good cause you shouldn&#x27;t in REST if HTTP is used as the communication channel) has only a few <i>methods</i>. But the <i>methods</i> of the <i>communications channel</i> are not the <i>verbs</i> of the <i>domain</i>, nor ought they map to the kinds of actions in the domain.<p>There&#x27;s a particularly common, but flawed, naive approach to domain modelling which maps the obvious nouns of the domain to entities/resource in the model and tries to map actions in the domain to methods in the medium in which the model is instantiated [1]. But this almost always ends up biting you -- instance of actions are nouns and need to be entities/resources too. If you do this, the more-obvious nouns of the domain tend to end up being read-only or read-mostly entities over the exposed interface, with most or all of the mutations happening through the entities/resources representing actions.<p>[1] While this happens with REST, it happens with other architectural patterns as well, and with different levels of application implementation -- not just web interfaces.",1408492816

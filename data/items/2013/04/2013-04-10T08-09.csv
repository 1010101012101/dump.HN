5523976,comment,5523640,5523640,12,0,rdl,,,"Arguably we've had ""fusion drive"" for spaceships ever since Project Orion.  Very simply, build a ship with a big shield in the back, throw nuclear bombs out behind the ship, detonate, the shock and radiation hits the plate (some ablates, but it's still fairly study and safe), and some kind of shock absorber system pushes the spaceship forward.  Repeat.  You can feasibly get to 0.10c with this, using 1960s technology, and really big ships.<p>I think most of the earlier designs involved fission bombs, but there's no reason you couldn't use fusion bombs, and maybe even some kind of laser or magnetic means of initiating fusion.  Which seems to be exactly what UW is talking about here.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsi...</a><p>A <i>lot</i> of the engineering and physiological problems of a Mars mission go away if you have the ability to move huge masses between Earth and Mars fast.

Actually, both use Newton's second law to generate thrust, i.e. some kind of material has to exit the engine in the opposite direction, in order to get things moving.  So, even ion drives and similar designs carry some material for the purpose of being ejected, it's usually just on a completely different scale to rockets.  Energy also needs to come from somewhere to facilitate this, with rockets, it's the chemical energy from the fuel itself.  With ion drives, it is usually some form of electricity, generated with a solar panel or nuclear power plant, etc.<p>So in reality, even the efficient drives also have to carry some way to power themselves.  To get more thrust, they need to have more power.  If you run the maths, by the time they have enough power to overcome Earth's gravity, they need to have an entire solar farm worth of panels (which are heavy), or a rather large nuclear power station on board (which is also quite heavy).  So, unless we find ways to make more powerful sources of energy, or even more ridiculously efficient drives, the thrust coming from these will not be able to overcome near-Earth gravity.",1365583468

I do not believe plain text will exist in 100 years, but that's another discussion. I am claiming something far weaker than what you seem to think I'm claiming. I do not think each and every website will be written from scratch on top of the VM. I'm simply claiming that the distribution mechanism for new features of the web will change.<p>Currently the features are mandated by the W3C, then implemented by all browser vendors. The browser vendors send out updates to all users. Instead what will happen is that some future version markup language that's better than the then current HTML will be distributed as a library, running on top of the VM. This way if you are a site owner, you can immediately start using it. You do not need to wait until (1) the W3C recognizes that this markup language is a good thing and standardizes it (2) the browser vendors have implemented it (3) your visitors have updated their browser. You simply include the library, and start using the new markup language.<p>Note that this is already happening in the small. Javascript libraries like knockout.js are already changing the fundamental model of building web applications. Instead of waiting for the W3C to standardize some kind of web components with data binding, people implemented it as a library. 20 years ago people would have thought such a thing impossible. They would have thought that something like that surely has to be built in to the browser. As JS gets more powerful, more and more features can be implemented this way, instead of through standardization. Note that things are still flowing over the network in markup language (in this case, knockout.js template language). A similar thing happened with form elements. Remember the xforms standardization effort? Nobody cares anymore because JS libraries offer far better rich forms elements. The thing that changed is where it's implemented: ON the web, rather than IN the web. This organic model is far more in line with the principles of the internet, rather than the centralized way it's done with the web standards. Instead of giving somebody a fish, give him the tools to fish.<p>> HTTP and HTML are foundational to the web. They are basically the simplest thing that could possibly work. You can reimplement them in a few days using a high level language.<p>A few days?! This is absolute nonsense. You can't even <i>read the spec</i> in a few days, let alone all the specs it depends on, like PNG, JPG, etc. Maybe you can implement some tiny subset of HTML in a few days, but the whole thing is massively complicated. In comparison a VM is far far simpler.<p>100 years is a very long time. The web is 23 years old.",1365583331

If it does, it would quickly move beyond its present goal of producing a more effective source of space acceleration and would answer some longstanding questions about fusion power itself.<p>The fact that this isn't being discussed leads to my statement above -- something is rotten in Denmark. Either the  project is overselling its possibilities, and/or it can't really achieve fusion break-even.<p>Speaking hypothetically, if the device could produce a sustained fusion reaction with substantial power, it could be scaled up and used to propel a spacecraft to Mars in much less than 30 days.

Currently they're mainly deploying fibre to the cabinet.<p>But the thing is, as much as I'm absolutely for a similar model to this, the technology is <i>not</i> mature enough that we know how to make it work best. BT OpenReach is struggling to provide the same speeds as Virgin. They claim to be able to offer up to 100Mbps, or 150Mbps in some regions, but my provider which packages BT OpenReach fibre access does not advertise more than 80Mbps and often advises to expect less (I was told to expect no more than 66Mbps based on distance from the cabinet because despite BT OpenReach's claims, they very rarely manage to meet it. Meanwhile Virgin reportedly have no problems reaching 100Mbps.<p>Without competition, there'd be little incentive for BT OpenReach to try to resolve the issues limiting their bandwidth. As it is, it matters so much that they keep misleadingly claiming they can deliver more (and many ISPs echo their claims).<p>I'd argue that while it is important to have a ""baseline"" provider that is required to offer 100% equal access, it is still important to provide wider access. There's really little reason not to require that every time a cable duct is put down to the local cabinet, that extra strands of fibre are laid down, for example, so other operators can rent dark fibre and install their own equipment. Or that cabinets be made big enough to accommodate some extra equipment for a small number of additional providers (and put similar access requirements on these providers, given that space in the cabinets will still be at a premium).<p>Today in the UK, other providers can put equipment in BT's exchanges, but apart from the densest city cores there's no practical way for them to provide connections to the end-user premises other than for Virgin (which is only in that situation because they merged UK's last two large cable providers who each had spent many years gobbling up smaller  operators, often at bargain prices as competition got fierce, and had already written off most of the cost of building out the physical infrastructure).<p>It isn't necessary to have 10 providers all operating their own equipment and their own fibre, but there's little practical reason not to make space for at least 2-3 providers all the way to the local telco cabinets (even if not immediately), and allow the subscribers connection to be reconnected to the equipment of any of these based on the subscribers wishes.",1365582095

Earth to Mars in 30 days will need you to be travelling at almost 90 km/second. The engine has to fire for 3 days straight because the delta v you need is retardedly high, so it pulses the engine once a minute so that the passengers don't die and the ship doesn't break up due to huge g-forces.<p>Lifting something into orbit needs to be done fast, because most of your energy is spent counteracting gravity, not air resistance.

One you seem to be speaking only of developers in the San Francisco and valley area. $100K for 2 years of experience is by no means a norm for 99% of the country.<p>Also, you seem to be saying that after some high school courses you're going to be dropped into a job immediately. I don't think so. One, it's a huge hurdle to bypass college. You're going to have to spend a lot of time refining your skills and then more time building some portfolio if you don't go to college.<p>Also, it's not normal to get 60% raises your first and second year in the workforce. You have to be exceptional and changing jobs. More likely the student will be earning $42.5K the third year if they stay at the same job. Even transitioning jobs, it's going to be hard (outside of the valley microcosm) for any hiring manager to give you a 60% pay raise for an entry-level position.<p>I think a better sales pitch and more realistic one is that after your courses and with several hard years of refining your programming skills, you can expect to make the median US household income your first year ($50K). And that with changing jobs, you can expect to be in the top 35% of income in a few years ($70K).

BT cover every home, but Virgin Media serve only the most populous areas. BT are progressively upgrading their POTS network, while Virgin's network was FTTC from the start.<p>BT only bother upgrading areas to fibre where they've got competition from Virgin Media, so people tend to either have the choice between two 100mbps fibre providers or none at all. The disparity in broadband speeds is growing rapidly, because the areas not served by Virgin Media tend to be those furthest from BT's exchanges and hence having the slowest ADSL speeds.<p>I'm not normally one to advocate government intervention, but the situation seems absolutely absurd.",1365581288

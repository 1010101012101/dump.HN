The backend servers would have to have some beefy CPU and memory, but still ultra commodity (256 bytes/tween means 1GB=4M tweets, so one 64GB server=256M tweets). Shard for latency, redundancy, etc. Also, special case the Gagas/Kutchers of this world by giving them their own server, and/or have them broadcast to and cache their tweets in the front end servers (Spend 256MB memory on tweet cache in the front end servers, and you get 1M cached tweets - which would cover all of the popular people and then some).<p>Network broadcast was invented for a reason.",1373348980

6011284,comment,6007650,6011140,1,0,jacques_chester,,,"Thanks, I hadn&#x27;t mentally partitioned OLAP/OLTP that way. I still think that the read/write distinction more correctly forms the dividing line.<p>That&#x27;s because the classical OLTP approach is to use relational databases. Relational databases do well in writes because in a properly normalised DB there is one, and only one, place for each datum to go. There is no fan out and potentially no coordination. A place for everything and everything in its place. That reduces the amount of write traffic required to support complex models of the problem domain by a lot.<p>But of course the relational view of a problem domain doesn&#x27;t really look like the humanistic view of a problem domain. And building the humanistic view of the problem domain usually means denormalising and breaking the things that made OLTP useful. Enter ETL pipes and OLAP systems.<p>From there it&#x27;s very humanistic and it requires no understanding of the relational model. Tools can easily turn  the dimensional tables into dropdown filter lists that look like a spreadsheet -- or even run inside a spreadsheet.",1373348610

Transit has far, far, higher density than cars do, no matter who&#x27;s driving them.<p>The problem with cars, for the most part is the immense amount of space that is dedicated to support them, usually at the expense of all other uses, and of the people living there.  Driverless cars would reduce this somewhat, but as a 1-for-1 replacement, not nearly enough to be useful.<p>Probably the best effect of driverless cars will be the other effects you mention: taxi-type services will get cheaper, thus fewer people will own cars, thus fewer people will feel tempted to drive everywhere, thus other modes will get more use, and cities will become more pleasant as car infrastructure shrinks, thus causing even fewer people to drive, etc, etc.<p>[and yeah, driverless buses etc, are a great application of the tech, maybe more so than actual cars as they&#x27;re more amenable to simplifications (dedicated routes with supporting infrastructure, etc)...]",1373347811

> The bug that lasted 347 days was the confusion between a string and an array of integers. This made the ECC private keys ridiculously small because they passed a string of decimal digits into a function expecting an array of 17, 15 bit integers. Each character was considered an element in the array. So each of those &quot;15 bit integers&quot; were only the values 0 to 9 (3.32 bits). Also the least significant 3 bits are zeroed giving you a key space of 2*10^16 (2^54.15). -- <a href=""http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php</a><p>See for yourself here: <a href=""https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/commit/a17bb1599463e0c079137d8200eb32002ac1afc7#src-core-js-lib-multiparty-js-P4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cryptocat/cryptocat/commit/a17bb1599463e0...</a><p>Even now looking at this code, for me it just doesn&#x27;t pass the &#x27;WTFs per minute&#x27; test...

(But LA Riots were in fact covered in Middle School, perhaps because they were more &quot;current events&quot; rather than &quot;history&quot; at that point in time). But High School was filled with &quot;TRUTH&quot;, in depth analysis and so forth. It was quite eye opening from my perspective. My High School US History class didn&#x27;t cover &quot;modern US History&quot; however, and stopped in the late 50s. &quot;Modern US History&quot; was an elective at my high school... so my knowledge past the 50s becomes a bit incomplete.<p>The school cop even ensured a visit to many classes, to describe the rights of citizens in the state.

LXC is like FreeBSD jails, though there are things you can do with the cgroup namespace stuff now that are impossible using jails... eg. disk io accounting.<p>in a jail, one user who attempts to monopolize disk io will succeed.  in a cgroup, he can be restricted to exactly 10% of available i/o bandwidth, so you can guarantee that he doesn&#x27;t starve the other containers.<p>there are also easy and documented ways to break out of a chroot if you are able to obtain root in the chroot.  those holes are plugged by lxc and docker.  Most notably, access to devices can be restricted.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;carry fat binaries and a kernel for chrooting an environment&quot; -- you don&#x27;t need a separate kernel for chroot, any more than you need a separate kernel for docker.  There&#x27;s no advantage to static linked binaries (fat binaries?) when you can put the storage of your containers in a zpool or btrfs with deduplification.  Same as your chroots.<p>Try out docker.  Read about cgroups.  I first gave LXC a try a few years ago and I was really sad about the extent of support for creating guests and keeping them properly isolated.  It was really not friendly at all.  You basically had to commit to using kernel patches that made your system pretty unusable as a desktop.  (Was that xen dom0 or lxc?)<p>Everyone was saying, &quot;Ohh, LXC is no better than a chroot.&quot;  It&#x27;s insecure, easy to break yourself out.  Not so much anymore, with the current state of Docker you don&#x27;t even have to know all the advances in cgroup and namespaces.<p>It&#x27;s worth a look.  Really, go check it out.",1373346194

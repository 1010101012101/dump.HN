384144,comment,383000,384052,0,0,GHFigs,,,"Read the sentence again.  It is a justification of their choice as being a practical one, not a statement about the quality of the book. They're saying that while ""Getting Real"" is the 4th best seller on Lulu, that's kinda like the old joke about ""What's better than winning a gold medal at the Special Olympics?""  To even have a hope of reaching ""real"" best seller status <i>requires</i> the resources of a traditional publisher, so that's what they did.  Whether they actually achieve that status is another question, one which they make no claims about.  That's why the next sentence reads ""We want to sell hundreds of thousands or millions of copies."" not ""We <i>will</i> sell hundreds of thousands or millions of copies.""",1228290780

Accordingly, no such features are cited.<p>I can't fathom why you found this interesting? All it makes me think of is Bob Dylan singing ""Don't criticize what you can't understand"".<p>Edit: I did think of one bit of tool support without which I would find Lisp unbearable: indentation and paren matching. Ok, maybe two bits. But that's a really low bar and, more to the point, has nothing to do with Emacs.",1228289708

One of the best ways to think about the difference is to call Bayesians pragmatic and Frequentists rigorous.<p>In that face of trying to quantify something you don't know, Bayesians take the stance that if you just say <i>something</i> — even if it's incorrect — and then keep adjusting it as more data comes in then you'll eventually have a valid statement. The idea is that even if your model is only so correct, at least you have one. Unfortunately, no one can actually prove that sort of thing actually works all of the time. It just seems to.<p>Frequentists faced with this situation instead try to understand the reason why something is happening and then model it from the beginning. By considering these rigorous models and testing them against data they eventually build a resilient model for the unknown which validates. That is, unless they don't, in which case Frequentists are kind of out of luck.<p>So when you're talking about statistics, which is all about trying to model things you don't understand, Bayesians and Frequentists get up in arms all the time because they each have something to call foolish about one another.<p>The coolest part is that this sort of schism is being reflected in the world of physics as well where Frequentists are in the Newtonian/Einsteinian school but, bit by bit, that worldview is being shaken up by Quantum.",1228288494

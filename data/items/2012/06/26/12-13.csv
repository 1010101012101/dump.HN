4161445,comment,4161233,4161233,2,0,rossb34,,,"#1: Reduce the load of the IT Equipment through server refresh, server virtualization, and storage virtualization. Do a server audit and remove servers that are no longer in use. It is common for large data centers to have servers that are not being used still in the racks, these servers are still eating up power and rejecting heat. Reducing the IT Equipment load has a cascading effect and reduces the energy consumption of the cooling plant (chillers and CRACs) as well as electrical equipment (PDUs and UPSs) losses.<p>#2: Once the IT Equipment load is reduced, look at optimizing airflow. Install variable speed drives on the CRAC supply fans to match the load. Consider installing a hot aisle or cold aisle containment system. This prevents the hot server exit air mixing with the cool conditioned air. Containment solutions will also enable you to be more aggressive with raising the temperature setpoint to reduce the load on the cooling equipment (i.e. your chiller or DX CRAC Units)<p>#3: Upgrade the cooling plant to more efficient equipment. The key efficiency metric is kW/ton. The lower the kW/ton, the more efficient the equipment is.<p>#4: Contact your local utility and ask them for ideas. I work a company that contracts with Utilities to provide assessment and energy efficiency incentive programs. Most data center projects I have worked on, the incentive is $50k+. Yes, some utilities will pay you to be more energy efficient<p>Also, check out the DC Profiling tool from the Department of Energy.",1340714081

I've been in datacenters where I need to grab a hoodie to work for any length of time -- that's a waste. Once you read and understand these books and do some data gathering, you should be able to either turn up the thermostat in your datacenter to 75-80 degrees F. (it's probably too cold) Also, If humans are comfortable working in hot aisles, it's way too cold -- the airflow is screwed up and you're cooling down air that doesn't need to be cold.<p>For a modest expenditure, you may be able to install blank panels in your racks, ducting or other equipment to make your cooling more effective.<p>You said that you have 10,000 servers. Time to get aggressive about virtualization. Did your company skip a refresh cycle or two because of the poor economy? If ""yes"", congratulations, you have some Intel Pentium 4 space heaters churning away in your datacenter. Good news is that you should be replace them on a 5:1 basis (very conservative) with virtual host servers, and show a net savings.<p>Install motion-activated LED lighting. Talk to your power utility or government agency charged with energy efficiency and see if grants are available. Lighting accounts for much more power consumption in datacenters than you may think!",1340713784

4161435,comment,4160987,4161230,2,0,tete,,,"I live in Austria. There is one nationalist, populist party with a number of neo-nazis in there called FP. It doesn't have too much power yet, but it's there. However, since most people have a deep hate of Nazis and everything that looks like it could this party knows it can't grow, if it remains that far to the right. That's why they currently throw out most of these members. Also, there have been two huge split-offs (LIF (liberals) and BZ (no idea what they are)). They have been the result of being too nationalistic.<p>Then there is Germany, which has an even more right wing movement called NPD. They clearly position themselves as far-right. They are mostly a party for skinheads/neo-nazi and don't really attract others. This party is considered too radical by most Germans and by all other parties.<p>Still nothing compared with what's going on Hungary. The problem there is that their nationalist party actually has power and in the recent years they killed off a lot of democratic elements, like the free press.<p>I know that there also is a nationalist, populist party in Switzerland, but I know nothing about it.<p>Also there are a few nationalist movements going on in a number of northern Europe countries, like Belgium and in countries where it has reason in more recent history, like Serbia.<p>It however seems to be a global problem. The US have always been very nationalist and a bit fascist, as you can see by flags everywhere and how important military is there. But it's way harder to distinguish them there, because there is these huge republican party which has the very extreme people, but also very, very liberal ones. Hard to tell whether that's good or bad. Well, you now have stuff like the tea party movement, which can be to compared not with the real nazi-like parties, but at least with the conservative, nationalist populist parties, often using religious symbols. From what I get I think they are really similar to the Austrian FP.<p>But also Russia and virtually every country has such movements. On one side they have to be there in a democratic society and it's better if they create parties than doing other stuff, but on the other hand it's really bad when they become so big.",1340713721

Perhaps use it to run a greenhouse for yourself or a charity / community project (good PR that)<p>But first you must be in a position to measure the effectiveness of any solution. Get records of your power usage, preferably by task - how much is used to run the servers, how much to run the cooling etc. Including the cost!

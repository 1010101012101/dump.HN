I see a Nokia 1100 from Germany and another 1100 from made in country.<p>P.S: I pointed out Nokia 1100 and Germany coz I heard the ones made in Germany are still selling in the cracker market for around $1000 becoz some defects in the Nokia 1100 made in Germany allow these crackers to reset IMEI numbers, reprogram it, etc",1242201001

Comments are metadata after all.<p>And this is more akin to annotations/attributes ala python, java, C#.  C++ doesn't have any feature that is approximate by virtue that annotations are aspects of reflection and C++ doesn't have reflection.",1242200885

I have respect for the man in the arena and I'm positive there's more information that I don't know; I'm just genuinely curious as to how one could spend that much money so quickly.<p>Realistically a fancy website and business cards should not cost you more than a few thousand/month. However, a nice office in a good location with fancy decor could really burn some cash.",1242200813

Pair a tall bean with another tall bean, you get a long offspring bean. This is where the phrase mendelian genetics comes from, and that's what I thought they named the company after.",1242200747

606614,comment,605776,605776,0,0,vicaya,,,"Twitter is just one decent take on real time pub-sub systems, which has been around for a while, previous incarnations include mailing lists, usenet groups and various forums etc. Twitter simplified the pub-sub of short messages from/to mobile devices and takes advantage of the aggregate knowledge. I think Twitter will be successful (profit!) in business marketing/networking, simply because it makes pub-sub simple.<p>I personally will probably never create a twitter account to follow or be followed because I'm more comfortable being a private explorer/observer (reading thousands of feeds and commenting occasionally)",1242199617

What order of magnitude is the minimum lot size?<p>And lets say you wanted to get your finished design into some plastic molding, how would you go about that?<p>I know that's a whirlwind of questions, but I think it's something a lot of software guys are really in the dark about and yet would like to know.",1242199366

You go it exactly right, Balsamiq is not a 'startup' in the pg sense, but rather a lifestyle business...I hope to be working on/for Balsamiq Studios for as long as possible, and to continue to have a great time doing it.

Thus you better have solid evidence there really exists unmet demand, probably via experiments in the earliest stages of the venture.",1242198774

One of the great things about Twitter is that people don't get too offended when you unfollow.<p>I think people will adapt to this however, though there may be a different style of replying to people to get around the changes (e.g. ""To @jack: Are you ready"")",1242198556

What I was really responding to was the idea that this approach would ""crush"" a more traditionally curated database.  At least in the short term, I don't see that happening, because the number of really high-quality data sources is still pretty tractable, because a lot of what's on the web is just going to be echoing/distorting those primary sources anyways, and because trust is such a huge part of that market.",1242198076

It's got different 8 commands, an input register and 2 CPU registers, one of which is the accumulator. There's memory for 16 instructions (dip switches!). As output it uses LEDs on the registers, so you can for example program it to multiply 2 4-bit numbers, and read out the accumulator at the end. It clicks away at 10 instructions per second.<p>The guy who built it also made a 1500 relais computer which is much more capable. You truly don't need much to build a computer - just a basic building block and enough ingenuity.",1266314216

1128635,comment,1128469,1128488,0,0,_delirium,,,"One way is to do more of your discussion in less-networked communities, and think of ways to support them. If you chat in an IRC channel with 50 regulars, the chances that you'll suddenly become a celebrity with 5000 people lurking in that channel to hear your next word are pretty close to zero. Same with posting in most forums.<p>I'm not sure IRC or webforums in particular are the future---to a certain extent they're canonical 90s and early 2000s past---but I think looking back towards communities and away from everyone-networked-into-one-huge-community-the-size-of-the-internet might be the way to go.",1266313969

Also, the article never gives any numbers for Greek government debt held by the US or UK. All this, plus some bad numbers (see the post's comments) make me dismiss most of this.",1266313906

1128611,comment,1128081,1128081,0,0,c1sc0,,,"This is the full text. (Did they purposely chunk it up to avoid open discussion or what?!)<p>Dear visitor,<p>As you can see, we have replaced our regular website with this letter.\nIt's going to stay up one week to express our discontent.<p>Allow us to explain. In the 1990's the UBA and the ACC developed a charter. All the major players signed up to it, and it defined the rules of the game for agency pitches for over a decade.<p>There's not much left of that charter now. For example, one of things it states is that no more than three agencies (plus the incumbent) should ever be invited to pitch on any piece of business. but in recent competitions, we've sometimes seem more than 10 agencies throwing their names into the ring.<p>Why does that matter? Well, Pitches, like boxing, work in rounds. You get through one round, and go onto the next. Last man standing wins. Unlike boxing, however, pitches rely on the participants punching themselves in the head.<p>A big pitch can cost an agency upwards of 80000 euro. Just getting into the second round takes huge amounts of energy. And if you're lucky enough to get that far, you then have to invest even more resources just to have a chance of getting something out of it. And if 10 agencies are taking part, that's a 90% percent chance that you're taking a bruising for nothing.<p>If that were the end of it, who would care? Nobody's going to lose any sleep if there are a few less advertising in the world. But the thing is it's not us who'll suffer: it's you we're worried about.<p>Pitches us up energy. Energy an agency would normally use to provide its existing, paying customers with the best possible work. So the logical conclusion of the system as it now stands is that at some point you will become a victim of it yourself. The day will eventually come when your agency has to divert the creative and stategic energy you're paying it for into a pitch for someone else's business.<p>Our idea of a sane world is where you do your best work for the clients you do have. Not the ones you don't. So we think it's in everyone's best interest to get back to where we started: the charter.<p>The charter that was put together by wise men not to protect themselves , but to protect their industry. The charter that makes sure a downturn doesn't turn into the demise of Belgian communications. The charter that ensures are matched.  With the agency they need. And that agencies are protected from their instinctive hungers not to miss out on opportunities.<p>Besides, judging an agency isn't rocket science. Our work is on every street corner, and all over the internet every day. (Except, today, of course). Our reputations, our beliefs and our individual visions aren't exactly trade secrets.<p>And our awards ... Well if you haven't heard of them you soon will. Talk to an agency and you'll see right away if they see things the same way you do. But don't delude yourself. Asking an agency to pitch is not the same as briefing one. In a pitch, the only target audience is you. The only question an agency can ask itself is, ""What do we need to do to get the client?""<p>But it's never too late to change. We recently confronted a major advertiser with how they were running their pitch. And they changed a speculative competition into a much more motivating an much lower-cost procedure.<p>Great idea. Great result. but we didn't think of it. It was just in the charter. So let's not all lose hope just yet. Thanks for listening.

1128607,comment,1128243,1128243,0,0,rjurney,,,"There was an ISP in the first floor of my building in Moscow, and you got broadband delivered by ethernet run up the stairwells.  There was a sign in the stairwell offering a reward for turning in whoever kept cutting the ethernet wires.  The gang of thugs that lived in the stairwell, would - in between using the stairs as a urinal and conducting brutal robberies - slash these wires regularly.<p>The ISP couldn't really call the police, because freedom in Moscow is equivalent to avoiding the police, and they were a shoestring operation without enough for bribes.  Not that the police would investigate even if you bribed them, they'd more like pick a few scapegoats and beat them up or torture them.<p>So my internet went out frequently.

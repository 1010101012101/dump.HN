8866673,comment,8863149,8865886,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">The main problem with salaries, career opportunities and so on is apparently that the number of people pursuing careers in science has risen to meet, then exceed, the increased funding. (Plus probably that an increasing share of the money is being funnelled off into university administration salaries, Elsevier and Bertelsmann and so on.)<p>The reason is much more fundamental: the Profzi Scheme, <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1144"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1144</a>.  As long as scientific labor is pyramidal, foisting most of the actual research work on &quot;trainees&quot; while professors mainly write grants, there will always be a structural necessity of far more trainee workers than there can ever be permanent positions.  Thus, most trained scientists will always be employed outside their field or not at all, simply because a finite world cannot accommodate an indefinite exponential (recursively reproducing) increase in the number of scientists.<p>(That said, science funding as a percentage of GDP <i>has</i> dropped, and actually dropped in inflation-adjusted dollars with the Great Recession.)",1420894651

Who are drilled meticulously until they sing with the tempo, phrasing, and dynamics the conductor wants.<p>In opera, conductors also try to cue the singers, so they know where they are and they don&#x27;t start phrases early or late.<p>In classical performances the tempo/time signature changes can be fearsome, and by the time you get to late 19th/early 20th C rep (Strauss, Wagner, etc) they&#x27;re terrifyingly complex.<p>So yes, conductors are essential.",1420894593
8866670,comment,8863451,8865346,0,0,sirclueless,,,"&#x27;mut&#x27; conveys the same thing you are trying to convey with &#x27;var&#x27; in a much better way. The term &quot;variable&quot; in programming languages doesn&#x27;t carry any connotations of mutability or immutability. All it traditionally means is &quot;named value&quot; or &quot;named memory address&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s actually entirely reasonable to have an &quot;immutable variable&quot; -- Rust uses this phrase in its error messages and it&#x27;s perfectly sensible. For example, consider this snippet:<p><pre><code>    pub fn is_even(x: int) -> bool {
        let y = (x / 2) * 2 - x;
        if (y == 0) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
Not very idiomatic, forgive me, but would you say that y &quot;varies&quot;? I would say yes, it varies for each invocation of is_even(). If y didn&#x27;t vary, &quot;if (y == 0)&quot; would be a nonsense statement. y is certainly immutable -- you can&#x27;t go assigning new values to it -- but it&#x27;s definitely a variable.<p>The opposite of &quot;variable&quot; is &quot;a constant,&quot; not immutable. &#x27;mut&#x27; means &quot;mutable&quot; and &quot;mutable vs. immutable&quot; is the choice here. Rust got this right, I think.",1420894521

The fact is, both operating systems are very similar nowadays, what you really have to compare is the ecosystem. iOS still has a better ecosystem with more high quality apps. Android has caught up in quantity, but not so much in terms of quality, yet. But that&#x27;s not a feature of an operating system, just market forces and economics at play.<p>Personally, I gave Android a try yet again this summer by switching to a Moto X Dev edition. One key feature for me is the ability to highlight text on the screen and have the phone read it to me. After many hours of trying to set this up with the use of some 3rd party programs, I gave up. It worked, but not reliably, and only by using the clipboard, which wasn&#x27;t a good solution for me. That&#x27;s really something that should be a 1st party feature, like it is in iOS. Other than that, the OS is solid. I ended up switching back to iOS in the end. For me Android is still much to ugly, but that a personal preference. To each his own.<p>You should give both operating systems a try, before making up your mind. It sounds like you haven&#x27;t. Also, don&#x27;t forget that there is Windows Phone 8 and Sailfish OS, both of which, though very small in terms of ecosystem size, are very interesting and innovative operating system, especially when you compare them to the stale looks of iOS and Android.

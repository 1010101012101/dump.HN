Scheme results are hard to determine and even harder to reverse/tweak.<p>Creating a network of ALPR cameras that enable mapping of major routes and centres of interest (e.g. schools) can also enable Local Authorities to focus money &quot;cleverly&quot;.<p>A case in point is Poynton, UK.

I can see it going one of two ways:<p>1. Multiple children has previously been reserved to those with political connections or money. Now that everyone can have two they will jump at the opportunity.<p>or<p>2. Almost every young person in China has grown up in a single child family and sees it as the normal family. Social norms are also based around parents dedicating a lot of resources to one child. So they continue to have only one child.

10470356,comment,10469189,10469259,0,0,cmsj,,,"> Is love worth it?<p>That&#x27;s up to you. Nobody can force you to love them, and you can always choose to walk away from potential loves.<p>Most of the replies to your post seem to be telling you that love is worth it. I think that is overly simplistic - we are not all the same. Some people find love, some don&#x27;t. Some people who do find it, make it last, some don&#x27;t. Some people who do find it resent it, some people who don&#x27;t find it resent not having found it.<p>I don&#x27;t think one size fits all, and I think people should try to make choices that fulfil them, whether that means prioritising work, or friends or family or exploration or wine tasting.<p>In particular, to those who suggest that love is an evolutionary advantage, I partially disagree. Or at least I think that is simply one facet of our species - one of our key strengths is diversity of being. We have the people who must go out and explore and discover. We have the people who must stay home and build families and societies. Only by having all of these things have we been able to expand across the planet and achieve everything we have. If everyone chose love over work, there are lots of things we wouldn&#x27;t have invented/discovered. If everyone chose work over love, we&#x27;d be a much smaller species, etc, etc.",1446119842

The GDR was dissolved, the FRG simply swallowed the remnants.<p>> The US and its allies transferred as much as the soviet union from Germany - though from a larger zone.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing the morality of it -- Nazi Germany had wreaked havoc in the USSR (and some Germans were surprised to see how well the soldiers treated them considering how badly the Soviets had been treated by Germany).<p>But the industry of East Germany was demolished to a far greater extent than that of West Germany. I&#x27;m well aware of the plans for West Germany that were discussed prior to the decision to grow it into an ally (rather than to de-industrialize it beyond insignificance).<p>My point is simply this: while West Germany had become an economic powerhouse deeply integrated into European and international economics, East Germany&#x27;s economy was largely a farce. By the time the borders were opened, the country was heading for disaster.<p>What&#x27;s more, after the reunification most of what little industry East Germany had moved to the West. It took a ton of state funding to get the east of Germany to where it is now and it&#x27;s still largely defined by large-scale unemployment and an ageing population (because the young adults always seek greener pastures).<p>In other words: yes, Germany is a powerful economy. But East Germany was nothing like that and naturalizing all East Germans as citizens and even exchanging their devalued currency at ridiculous rates was an enormous expense.",1446119606

I think the slowness of manual tallying is a security property since anyone can inspect the computation while it&#x27;s being run. All other technologies like Civitas, Scantegrity etc. are not cheaper but more expensive than this manual process and open up great possibilities for state level adversaries.<p>I think your system (using peoples computers) might be trusted when the stakes are lower though.

Lemme explain..<p>IMO Flipboard is a <i>beautiful</i> RSS and social reader where users subscribe to various feeds. And because it works on the subscription model (like Twitter or whatever RSS tool), users inevitably get overloaded with lots of content. There&#x27;s no proper filtering on Flipboard.<p>Nuzzel is a <i>filtering</i> tool, very useful if you&#x27;re already subscribed to (ie follow) lots of profiles on Twitter. Simple tool for power users.<p>Svven on the other hand is a <i>discovery</i> tool, and the way it works is quite unique. \nIt starts from the links you tweet, and automatically discovers similar people (aka fellows) based on that. Then it aggregates the news tweeted by these fellows -- so this 2nd step is kinda like what Nuzzel does.<p>Because of this approach Svven works pretty well for Twitter users that haven&#x27;t figured out who to follow yet. They only need to tweet a couple of links so Svven discovery kicks in and figures out the rest. This also introduces an important incentive for users to tweet what matters to them.

That can happen if you only care about coding as an activity, and not about reaching specific goals.  It can also happen if your goals fit within the amount of coding you can do individually in whatever milieu you&#x27;re doing it.  What if the thing you want to do, the software you want to create, requires more than that?  Then you have to pull together a team, which brings in a whole bunch of complexity and loss of control.  It can be awesome, or it can be draining and frustrating.  Sometimes it&#x27;s both.<p>On the flip side, &quot;full time at home&quot; isn&#x27;t an option for many (probably most) people who&#x27;d be reading your comment or mine.  Somebody has to make some money, not for its own sake but to reach family goals - housing of a certain quality, schools, sports or hobbies, whatever.  Then there&#x27;s a time commitment on top of that.  It&#x27;s a lot with one kid, it&#x27;s more with two or three, it&#x27;s <i>far</i> more if any of them or ill or troubled or disabled.<p>For many people, just having to choose is frustrating.  People want to have a successful career <i>and</i> a good family life <i>and</i> time for themselves, and they just can&#x27;t have all of them.  Giving up on &quot;having it all&quot; is really really hard, and it&#x27;s not immature.  In fact it&#x27;s the characteristic struggle of mature people, leading to burnout and mid-life crises.  It&#x27;s the immature, with fewer commitments and simpler goals, who seem least affected.<p>That&#x27;s (part of) why I think your &quot;that&#x27;s immature&quot; is itself the most immature thing I&#x27;ve ever seen on HN.  It shows a startling lack of empathy for people going through something you apparently never have.  I hope you <i>are</i> young, because if you can still say such a thing from the vantage of experience that&#x27;s even more pathetic.  The struggle is real, and being laughed at or condescended to as you go through it doesn&#x27;t exactly help.  It&#x27;s part of what Jesse was warning about.",1446117868

Everything today is flat, sketchy, inexpressive and boring.<p>> How I miss Netscape, the feeling of discovering something new in computers that made you go &quot;wow&quot; (IE4 and DHTML), or the feeling of &quot;this is really great and USEFUL&quot; instead of &quot;this is really pretty&quot;, the joy of getting X to run, or learning a new Linux command whilst stuck in the CLI, getting VNC to work, doing X-window forwarding. I miss the lack of Internet, the fact that knowledge of systems came through hard work and patience, through reading and waiting for the next month&#x27;s magazine that I bought with my paper-round money. I truly am an old fart.<p>I sometimes find myself thinking the same, but I guess it&#x27;s the slow pace that allowed me to <i>fixate</i> that knowledge that I miss.

While PTFE is generally well tolerated, he will need to take blood thinners for his entire life to reduce the risk of embolisms.<p>The prospect of one day being able to print an artificial vein, from materials that do not increase the risk of embolisoms, with an optimal fluid dynamic profile, possible even one that could grow with the patient...

If you’re coding basic low-cost websites at a high pace, you might run out of business faster than you might expect. If you can do it by repetition, a machine certainly can do that too. If you’re building crucial online services with a lot of custom functionality, the machines will have a harder time to keep up.

People will be making icons and fan art based around it, and pulling all kinds of stunts that would normally catch the ire and get a swift cease and desist from a major company like Nestle.<p>So has Google negotiated with Nestle that they are not going to suddenly get &quot;uncool&quot; with this and go with the flow?

For that to be justified it needs to be a drain on society in some significant way.<p>Substance bans do not /at all/ have a track record of being grounded in quantifiable measures of societal harm. That is to say, the current substance restriction policies are more or less completely arbitrary. The arbitrariness of current policies gives a natural experiment opportunity to assess the harm of the criminalization policies themselves by comparing the societal impact of substances such as caffeine, tobacco/nicotine, and alcohol with those of marijuana plus the associated negative impacts of marijuana criminalization. At least in the case of marijuana, the cure seems to be significantly worse than the disease.<p>>I support the ideal war on drugs (one based on evidence to show that it does more good than harm).<p>I wrote a more generalized comment[1] on the idea of an &quot;ideal war on drugs&quot;. The gist is that I think it&#x27;s a completely fantastical idea. The idea that you can squash a market with inelastic demand is soundly dispelled by all current and historical attempts at doing so. Further, I think that it&#x27;s harmful that such an idea persists, because it allows for the justification of more and more extreme enforcement measures. Arguments like &quot;If we got rid of meth then society would be significantly improved?&quot; are based on a false premise. This is an outcome that clearly cannot be brought about by the war on drugs, yet such reasoning is continually used as a justification for more and more extreme enforcement measures that have increasingly diminishing returns as well as an increasingly negative impact on broader society as a whole.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6324214"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6324214</a>",1378248024

Note that anything the individual is forced to do against their will without appropriate compensation is out of the question; such as bad schools, prison, and, dare I say it, American team sports?<p>Yes some people are more prone to addictive behavior than others, and yes severe depression is a serious disease which must be handled by professionals. However, the malaise in America is not clinical depression: it&#x27;s the lack of opportunity to learn, excel, and be rewarded for such excellence. Yes, this opportunity exists for many people, and many do take advantage of it, to great benefit. Many others, though, for a variety of reasons, lack that opportunity. It is generally these people who fuel demand for drugs, to escape the misery and blight of a dead-end future. These people are not losers, but people to whom the dealer of cards dealt a poor hand, and who have not been told by the media and their peers that no hand is a bad hand, that there are opportunity in adversity, that it is through failure that success comes. They, alas, believe that their lot is to suffer, then die, not having achieved anything worthwhile. So, in their desperation and utter loneliness, they seek a fleeting pleasure, a personal high, to momentarily drift away from the relentless and inexorable approach of Death.<p>Do you wish them well? Do you seek to help them? Change yourself. Show them by the example of your own life that adversity can be overcome. Show them by the kindness in your speech, by your countenance, by your actions, that they are not ostracized from human society, but rather, as fallen and wounded, deserve further aid, further care from the rest of us.<p>Or do you wish them away? To be put in prison and removed from your neighborhood, your city? Do you blame them for the poor choices they have made? In their lack of ability, they fell, and unable to stand, they stayed down. Are they weak, ill-fitted for society, and perhaps their premature death at the hand of violence, poverty, and the lawman, is the just reward for their inability to thrive in the Modern Age?<p>As I see children in the playground at my son&#x27;s elementary school, I see them all alike: full of joy, vitality, and wonder.

6324214,comment,6322352,6322352,2,0,shawn-furyan,,,"As a meta-commentary on this category of issues, I tend to be against these sort of substance bans (PEDs[1] in sports is another timely example), and I often see that people who support such measures tend to talk about what things would be like if these substances were completely gotten rid of[2]. To me, this is complete fantasy because there&#x27;s never been a substance ban that has been very effective at reducing usage of a popular substance, instead such bans simply create black markets out of open markets. But when there&#x27;s this idea, mostly but not exclusively on the pro-criminalization side, that we can completely stamp out markets where there is inelastic demand through bans/criminalization and enforcement, then you get justifications for more and more extreme measures from the enforcement side. In reality though, we tend to see hugely diminishing returns accompanying these measures, and the numbers in the article demonstrate these diminishing returns well (i.e. the program is incredibly broad, yet the spoils being bragged about are incredibly paltry compared to the size of the related markets).<p>The assumption that bans/criminalization can significantly reduce demand for substances with inelastic demand is completely unreasonable given the track record of such measures. For example, demand for PEDs in professional sports is particularly inelastic because the rewards for even marginal increases in performance are so high and the penalties are so rare and low as to easily be subsidized by the increased salary resulting from use of PEDs, not to mention the cognitive and social biases that favor optimizing short-term over long-term performance.<p>In discussing such issues, I think that actual outcomes of previous and current banning/criminalization policies has to start being favored as the baseline effect of future policies rather than this pie in the sky idea that these sort of policies can have at or near 100% efficacy. Then perhaps we can move on from the inane moralizing that tends to accompany such discussions to a point where we can have results oriented discourse grounded in reality on these topics.<p>[1]Performance Enhancing Drugs, actually used more broadly to label all performance enhancing substances including human hormones and blood oxygenation.<p>[2]this really isn&#x27;t a straw man, I&#x27;ve been involved in a few discussions in the last couple months in which the ban/criminalization proponents (about 4 or so different people) were arguing their position from the assumption that bans/criminalization can lead to reduction of substance usage to negligible levels.<p>[edited to fix formatting and to clarify footnote 1]",1378246555

Microsoft has about equal numbers of workers, and revenue, inside and outside the US. The same could be said for Apple. That makes the US a huge market, and it makes sense they are based there. But if being based in the US put them at a disadvantage in the rest of the world (e.g. they had to pay tax twice), it is likely they would move, at least notionally.<p>There is a big problem with companies that don&#x27;t pay tax anywhere, or nominate very low tax countries.

No coffee ever passes through its small but extremely profitable office in the low tax country. That&#x27;s annoying, as it puts the burden of subsidizing welfare salary top ups for its underpaid workers on me.<p>To suggest a solution - The answer here is to tax sales in the country the buyer is in, rather than taxing profit. Sure, it&#x27;ll kill some low margin companies, but the overall economy will work better because it won&#x27;t be so skewed by how easily a particular industry can dodge tax.

There&#x27;s a whole world of posts there:<p>- Best ways to monitor mobile use patterns while minimizing app footprint?<p>- What database should I store the entire world&#x27;s email in?<p>- Ask HN: I&#x27;m a founder of a spying SaaS platform -- how can I launder &quot;black money&quot; from intelligence agencies?<p>- Ask HN: What Saudi telecos are hiring hackers to help them spy on their people?<p>Just remember to pitch a fit every time the mobile equivalent of a popup ad gets blogged about. Because those developers are giving us all a bad <i>name</i>, damn it.",1378245614

The UI is terrible, but what&#x27;s worse is that the code sample is not sufficient to differentiate the huge swath of Algol-derived languages. This is much like the impossibility of distinguishing all of the vaguely cyrillic baltic languages in the human language game posted earlier.<p>In the &quot;Identify a Language Game&quot; Game, this one loses.

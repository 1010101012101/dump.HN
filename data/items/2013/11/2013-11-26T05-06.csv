6799412,comment,6794122,6799061,1,0,javert,,,">  I&#x27;m not sure what sort of context can explain away this real-life Randian superman. (and it&#x27;s interesting that you mention Rand and crime and the Fountainhead, given that Howard Roark blew up Courtlandt Homes with dynamite)<p>Well, if you want to be sure, read The Fountainhead and Atlash Shrugged.<p>The Fountainhead is actually an explicit repudiation of Neitzche (though it is more than that).<p>There is a Nietzschean hero in the book---and he is driven almost to suicide, and is completely destroyed.<p>Rand greatly admired <i>one aspect</i> of Hickman: that he wasn&#x27;t influenced by other people; he was fully himself. The actual hero of The Fountainhead is like that, but rather than being a destructive parasite (of self and others), he uses his independence to achieve real goals and values in life in a way that does not vicitimize anyone.<p>He did blow up Cortlandt Homes; importantly, nobody was in the building and nobody was harmed, and he did it because the plans for the building were essentially stolen from him. He does it to make a point, which he does make.",1385445574

Truly beautiful code comes from experience and working with those who have spent years getting that experience. In my current company there is a huge focus on the re-usability and extensibility of the code. We are forced to think of future changes and make sure the code allows changing things in the most easy way possible.<p>One simplest example: All queries to a single DB table have to be done through a single &quot;Data Class&quot;. The class will have functions that will allow other classes to use that table. this ensures that if tmrw, we make changes to that table, there is only one place in the code we have to make the changes.

In your letter dated January 9, 2013, you stated that the firm is “completing the additional analytical and clinical validations for the tests that have been submitted” and is “planning extensive labeling studies that will take several months to complete.” Thus, months after you submitted your 510(k)s and more than 5 years after you began marketing, you still had not completed some of the studies and had not even started other studies necessary to support a marketing submission for the PGS. It is now eleven months later, and you have yet to provide FDA with any new information about these tests.&quot;<p>The FDA, while being a pain in the rear at times, will actually work with you to meet compliance. But you have to show work and be continually in touch with them and show progress (and document everything according to your own procedures, complying to regulations of course). You can&#x27;t just say you&#x27;re working on compliance and then not follow through and show evidence. The issue for 23andMe is the on-label use of the product &quot;in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or function of the body.&quot; They market the product this way. If you want to market your product as such, you have to show proof to the FDA and receive approval to label the medical product in this manner. It looks like 23andMe is either not working towards compliance (and is misleading the FDA) or is doing a terrible job documenting their work towards compliance and keeping the FDA abreast (my guess is this is what&#x27;s happening). That in itself will get you in trouble, but then expanding your marketing for even more on-label use of the product - which hasn&#x27;t been submitted to the FDA apparently - while at the same time not having FDA approval for the original use is just plain stupid.",1385443997

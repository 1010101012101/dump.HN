She determined which noises were airborne and which were from vibration. With that information she was able to specify materials and construction methods that would hush the rattle and hum.<p>Throughout the 3,500-square-foot apartment, pipes and ducts were wrapped in acoustic barrier insulation, walls and ceilings were hung on vibration-absorbing rails and floating floors were installed, at a total cost of about $200,000.<p>...<p>The solution is seldom as simple as adding insulation. Noise is insidious. No two room hums are exactly alike, and what silences one might make another worse. &#x27;What a contractor did across town that worked 99 percent of the time might not work for you,&#x27; said Alan Fierstein, an acoustical consultant who owns a 39-year-old New York firm called Acoustilog.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/realestate/soundproofing-for-new-york-noise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/realestate/soundproofing-f...</a>",1451433568

So if a prescription delivery company (like ScriptDash, NimbleRX, etc) want to send a delivery person with a prescription, the driver needs to be HIPAA certified. Otherwise the company would be in massive trouble for violating HIPAA requirements.<p>It&#x27;s not a common enough use case for Uber/Lyft&#x27;s consumer facing services, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise for them to get into it; they&#x27;re better going after UberEATS/etc opportunities. The idea would be ridesharing for businesses who have more strict requirements, kind of like Box vs Dropbox.<p>FWIW, you still deal with the difficult people operations aspect of ridesharing in that case (drivers are hard to recruit and manage, and are city specific), so I&#x27;d probably go after outsourcing the logistics platform for businesses with existing delivery mechanisms.

10809685,comment,10808359,10809202,0,0,robmiller,,,"I wrote about this on Quora [1] some time ago.  Here are the highlights on some ways to check if the unit you&#x27;re touring has an above average acoustical design without just making noise in an adjacent unit:<p>(1) Is the floor construction concrete and steel or a wood joist system.  The concrete/steel building type is preferred.  A caveat is if it is a &quot;loft&quot; style with no ceiling (drywall, etc) and is open to the concrete structure for reasons I&#x27;ll describe at the end.<p>(2) Ask if the apartment building was designed to convert to condos at some point.  If the potential conversion was known during design, an acoustics professional may have been involved.<p>(3) Is the space marketed as &quot;luxury?&quot;  While dangerous to trust marketing this much, if legitimately so, should have &quot;above norm&quot; acoustical separation between spaces.<p>(4) Pull a wall plate off a switch that&#x27;s in a demising wall between units and look for fiberglass in the wall cavity around the edges of the backbox.  You may be able to knock on walls and tell if they&#x27;re hollow or fiberglass filled.  If you find two layers of drywall between the plate and backbox, that&#x27;s a good sign.<p>(5) Often the bathroom/toilet plumbing is along the corridor wall in newer buildings.  Can you hear the water running from the corridor?  If so, you can expect to hear the neighbors&#x27; plumbing above your unit too.  Listen for water hissing in the walls while you run the kitchen sink.<p>Yes there&#x27;s noise through walls from adjacent neighbors, but be aware of impact noises above.  If floors are hard (not carpet) expect to hear footfall noise unless a resilient underlayment was properly installed in the units and/or the ceiling is isolated in the unit below.  If the unit has hardwood floors, check for a gap between the baseboard trim and the floor by running a business card between.  If it doesn&#x27;t fit, then the resilient floor is compromised and your neighbors below are likely to hear your footfalls, and chances are you will hear your neighbors&#x27; above too.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.quora.com/When-renting-an-apartment-how-can-I-tell-how-sound-proof-the-walls-are/answer/Rob-Miller-9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/When-renting-an-apartment-how-can-I-te...</a>",1451430758

It was literally concrete between every floor. Then I moved out to Fairfax Virginia into a newer, plywood construction. I could hear my neighbors quite well. Newer buildings used cheaper materials, and as such sound travels easily.",1451430312

As such, Google wants to put more resources into OpenJDK where the team can have a bigger impact on new features and improvements. That’s the developer story Google is pitching in any case, but there’s a massive legal narrative here that can’t be forgotten.<p>Yes, the legal narrative is <i>certainly</i> key here, but as a dev I&#x27;m all for a move that brings Java 8 to Android instead of just Java 6.

The one thing that is always unclear about services like yours is how well it scales to hundreds of servers and how it integrates with other orchestration mechanisms/tools like fabric, salt, awscli, and other custom services and tools. I&#x27;d be interested in knowing more about how you&#x27;re approaching that aspect since most places re-invent the same things over and over again internally.<p>The other issue is that what happens when you have downtime? Is my deploy train stopped because of it? How do I design things so that even though I use your service I still have fallback mechanisms?",1451430187

And in fact, Microsoft has far less control over a Windows PC than Google and Apple do over their respective phone OSes, especially if you don&#x27;t use a Microsoft cloud account.<p>> <i>The status quo was that if law enforcement or criminals seized your computer, they by default could access all your files.

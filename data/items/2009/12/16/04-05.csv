998138,comment,997385,997926,0,0,westbywest,,,"If you know that a cap is suspect, and the article mentions what are probably helpful sources like badcaps.net, then you can accelerate the aging process by running the board in question at 10-20% overvoltage in a temp chamber heated to 100C or whatever your design's edge case is.  MBTF values assume nominal voltage and temp, so increasing this has the effect of decreasing the mean time.  This is not 100% guaranteed, since you are tweaking parameters of a statistical formula, but you nevertheless stand a good chance of weeding out a particular brand/model cap if you test multiple units and compare the results to those from a control group.  A past job did exactly this to qualify part substitutions, and this sort of testing is effectively a requirement for temp-sensitive parts like caps.  We were able to successfully weed out bad caps with this testing.",1260939229

But that's just sweet sounding bullshit that was a fancy way of saying, ""As long as the weaker party actually wants what I would.""<p>The best I can come up with, and this is oh-so-typically-German, is to say, ""Ok, Apple still can't invade their privacy.  But I'm fine with ratcheting up the legal repercussions of violating the trust of the employer.""<p>In other words, I'd be fine if more things were promoted up from the level of contract violations and moved closer to the penalties for industrial espionage in an effort to provide a stronger legal deterrent for information leakage, and also to bring in a third-party arbiter (the courts) to decide when, as in any legal proceeding, additional search and seizure is warranted by just cause.  (See, I knew I could work in the Fourth Amendment somehow.)<p>As noted, that is a typically German jurisprudential notion, and I did have to think it through some.

My point is more about people being complacent with ""Good enough"" and it being okay to give the 3rd world something that was fine 10 years ago.  They're less behind, but we're still complacent with leaving them behind.  It's like giving a homeless man a piece of bread.  Why not try to give them a full meal?  I'd love to see a concerted effort from a bunch of smart people to make a device that actually got the 3rd world on a level that they can do some of the important things we can with a computer TODAY.

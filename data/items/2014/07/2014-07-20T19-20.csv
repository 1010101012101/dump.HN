Taylor Bennett, a spokesman for Uber, said the company will pay for all the fines that its drivers in Charleston are issued by law enforcement officers, even if the drivers are cited more than once for the same violation.<p>> That may not be an empty promise. The San Francisco-based technology company is backed by Google Ventures, which recently estimated that the company is worth more than $200 billion, according to Bloomberg<p>I&#x27;m a bit surprised this works. My big concern if I were paying someone&#x27;s fines for breaking the law would be RICO laws.

It&#x27;s a real issue - but NOT one that DNSSEC seeks to solve. <i>Because</i> of this issue, many of us who advocate DNSSEC also advocate that the DNSSEC validation happens as close as possible to the end user, including even within the applications used by the user.  If not in the apps then in the operating system.  And if not there then on the local network... but then you start expanding the zone of risk.  For the DNSSEC integrity validation to be useful it needs to happen as close as possible to the user - OR have a secured connection between the user and their DNS resolver.<p>From a DNSSEC advocacy point of view, I&#x27;m always glad when a provider of DNS resolvers turns on DNSSEC validation... but public DNS servers are farther away from the end user than I would personally like to see.  It&#x27;s a good first step... but we really need the integrity validation happening close to the user.",1405886173

The only affect that the market has on the local market for lobsters in Bangladesh, is via the price in Bangladesh, i.e. the price the fishermen pay.<p>So to the extent that they are affecting the market in Bangladesh, they must be paying higher prices, and therefore the parent comment applies.<p>>But unless you&#x27;re an economist, you have to posit that the enjoyment from a lobster dinner is the same whether you&#x27;re a Bengali villager or a yuppie in San Francisco. In a sense they&#x27;re giving up $60 of enjoyment to get a couple of dollars of cash.<p>The economists are in fact correct.  You cannot measure enjoyment in dollars, because $60 will buy a lot more additional enjoyment for a Bengali villager than a San Francisco yuppie.  So the villager would be willing to give up the enjoyment of a lobster dinner for much less than $60, which is precisely what they are doing.",1405885943

However, one thing I recall seems indicative of some of the systemic problems with how he/they think about the world:<p>EY once wrote that he tried &quot;exercise&quot; (unspecified but presumably steady cardio) and found that it &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot;. His conclusion was that he....inherently was unable to improve his physical fitness due to some genetic trait that a minority of the population was cursed by.<p>That is so breathtakingly arrogant and foolish that I was taken aback and it was one of the many small things that led me to question his &#x27;rationality&#x27;.<p>Presumably, EY was a baby, and like all other babies, gradually developed increased muscular strength and coordination during the process of learning to walk. Thus, his muscles are capable of responding to stress and adapt to that stress by getting stronger. If EY had the grit to actually try rigorous training such as progressively loaded barbell squats I&#x27;m quite sure he would experience at least a modest, but measurable, increase in physical fitness.

I&#x27;m asking why these entities with the power to violently coerce others would operate friendly protection agencies, instead of simply stealing from everyone around them? I consider this a pretty obvious and fundamental flaw with anarcho-capitalism.</i><p>So the first thing to understand here is that monopolies and cartels can&#x27;t exist without government protection for a long time (if you look at every case of a monopoly/cartel careful enough, you&#x27;ll see some government involvement). When some company introduces a new, revolutionary technology (Microsoft or Apple both being examples) they may capture the market for a while, but not for long. Government didn&#x27;t order Google to compete on the smartphone market. It happened because it was profitable to do so.<p>Now back to protection agencies. Suppose I&#x27;m an evil protection agency that wants to force everyone to pay, just like a government would. Alright. I send everyone an extortion notice and suggest that if they don&#x27;t pay, we come and take money + fines (for our extra effort) by force and if they resist - we imprison them. People, being free and not brainwashed as they are, wouldn&#x27;t see us as a protection agency anymore, but as an extortion agency. They wouldn&#x27;t have any illusions about us being nice and kind. Therefore, there would arise a demand for another protection agency, that would offer protection from the evil agency. Naturally, people would rather pay the second protection agency, as it doesn&#x27;t demand pay, but offers a service, therefore presenting itself like a legitimate business. The other protection agency would quickly lose its market share and wouldn&#x27;t be able to finance its extortion, not even talking about any kind of war with the second agency. In the case in which the two agencies form an extortion cartel, it is not difficult to imagine a third firm emerging. And so on.<p>Therefore, competition is the key. Free market always serves the customer.<p><i>>Then you have a bunch of rich people doing nothing, but enjoying the majority of the wealth</i><p>You have to be precise here. What does enjoying the wealth mean? If they buy stuff, they create jobs. If they don&#x27;t buy, but hoard, they are not enjoying the wealth in any way. Every time an evil businessman tries to enjoy his wealth, he creates jobs. And the more he enjoys, the more jobs are created. That&#x27;s inevitable.<p><i>>Yet again, assuming they have any money. If your hypothetical society hates redheads to the point of wanting them dead, then I would expect them to be incredibly poor, since their ability to participate in the market would be extremely limited.</i><p>Now let&#x27;s look at this comparison fairly. We talk about two societies, one with no state and one with a state, both hate redheads. Now if the majority in a society with a state hates redheads, wouldn&#x27;t they pass laws that would restrict redheads from escaping the poverty? You&#x27;d think that. So redheads wouldn&#x27;t have any money either. Worse even, in a society with a state if it&#x27;s not the rest of the 90% that hate redheads, but say, only 70%, they can still pass a law that says &quot;redheads cannot be hired for more than $1 an hour&quot;. Then, even those who have nothing against redheads will not be able to hire them, whereas in a stateless society they would.<p><i>>Can you explain why you think the freedom to decide how the last 10% of your income gets spent is more important than the freedom to eat?</i><p>I think it&#x27;s very important to communicate one sound principle, with which I hope you might agree sometime: you can&#x27;t do good by forcing other people to do it (that is, by using the money you stole from them). If I had nothing to eat tonight, do you think it&#x27;s okay if I go and rob you? If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ok, why do you believe it&#x27;s okay for the government to do the same on my behalf? How is it more humane or fair to you?

8061167,comment,8060347,8061057,9,0,bitexploder,,,"I think another key factor with a lot of modern unhappiness is that, as the article notes, money does not correlate to happiness as long as you are above the poverty line.<p>We have lost the art of teaching people how to have a philosophy of life. We teach people how to have a craft. We teach basic morals. In religious households you may even be taught a pretty comprehensive &quot;life philosophy&quot;, but it is often underpinned by many practices that defy rationality, and I think, lead many to unhappiness.<p>A few years ago I stumbled on some pretty interesting reading about Stoicism and I have since read much of ancient greek philosophy and a bit of more modern stuff like Kant. It still sort of blows my mind just how insightful the ancient greek philosophers were about human nature. One of the key principles of Stoicism that has an analogue or similar set of features in many other philosophies is that it is essentially not things that happen to us that cause us pain/grief/sadness/unhappiness but our judgement and reaction to those things. It seems a little trite in a short post like this, and I can&#x27;t sum up something as complex as an entire school of philosophical thought, but it has worked well for me.<p>I have been in conversations where life philosophies like Stoicism and other related ancient greek philosophies get dismissed out of hand. Only to have a conversation wind over our current empirical approach to happiness. This less wrong article is /exactly/ what I call this empirical approach to happiness. Study all of the correlates, take all the best modern science about which behaviors yield the most happiness and which yield the least happiness and optimize accordingly.<p>Yet, 1800+ years ago, ancient philosophers identified many of the same principles articles like this are encouraging us to apply to our lives. What is missing from this article, and I think that can often cause many people to fail at sticking with a plan, is a coherent and binding strategy for all of this disparate &quot;strategies for happiness&quot;. The ancient philosophies are not perfect, us moderns have learned a thing or two since Socrates and Epictetus, but their insights on the human condition are too keen to ignore. We know a lot more about genetics, and I have witnessed the ravages of deep nearly incurable depression on my family. Even the ancient stoics knew of depression and how it could destroy rationality of the most adept philosophers. Outside of these parameters, I would argue, strongly, that we could all live with a little more Socrates and Epictetus in our life and a little less religious extremism and modern consumerism.<p>And this brings me to my main point, without a rational, modern, and scientifically palatable life philosophy for how to think and feel about /everything/ it is very easy to put yourself into negative emotional states. I have found with a system to judge and evaluate emotions, and a keen understanding of the basic tendencies of my nature, I don&#x27;t need a lot of empirical scientific knowledge to stay happy, though it does inform my approach.<p>When I read your post it made me think of myself and my old strategy of decreasing pain/bad moments and increasing good moments where good feelings are more likely. Now, I proceed in a manner as I see fit and I simply accept that much of my feelings are up to me and that jealously, sadness, and anger are just my judgement or feelings about something. I have also, often found, that when properly analyzed, I am not truly sad about a situation, merely that my judgements were wrong. I have definitely embraced many stoic principles into my life, and when I continue to work at maintaining and improving my understanding and ability to apply the principles I have adopted, I stay very even keeled, neither greatly happy or greatly sad.

If the locals choose to sell them for the few dollars they get for them, either: 1) the locals are irrational; 2) or the value of the dinner to them is less than a few dollars.<p>In neoclassical economics, we assume rational actors. So it must be 2. But why would a Bengali villager get much less utility out of a lobster dinner than a San Francisco yuppie? Sesfood is a staple in Bangladesh, and lobster is a delicacy. [1] The answer is because they&#x27;re poor: measured by the market, they, ostensibly, ascribe less value to everything than the San Francisco yuppie.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting result. The San Francisco yuppie derives far more utility from that lobster than the Bengali villager does. Why? Because he&#x27;s richer. By the measure of the market, the rich derive far more utility from everything, and the market allocates scarce resources to those who value them the most.<p>[1] This is not an example out of an economics textbook, where country A sells something it doesn&#x27;t value to country B who does value it.",1405882837

This is what makes ChromeOS work while UEFI still fails at times.<p>No moving parts means no worries - that&#x27;s a lesson the UEFI architects never understood.<p>So they built that living hell of runtime composable components for something that generally tries to get out of the way in as few milliseconds as possible. Some of these components survive long into the operating system&#x27;s domain, messing things up there. The architecture doesn&#x27;t allow for build time controls (eg. why did boot services used by runtime services, a common bug a couple of years ago, not trip up a linker? because they incapacitated the linker through this design).<p>And best of all, thanks to Intel relentlessly pushing that crap into the market, we&#x27;ll get to &quot;enjoy&quot; it for the next three decades or so.<p>Apart from being able to check the &quot;Windows&quot; checkbox on marketing material, I actively avoid UEFI because of this horrid imitation of software design.<p>UEFI is that bad.",1405882832

I combined the perception terms instead of cancelling since presumably they&#x27;re different, but here you go:<p><pre><code>  Happiness = Perception * (1 / Happiness) * Skill * Circumstance / Others&#x27; Actual Life\n  Happiness^2 = Perception * Skill * Circumstance / Others&#x27; Actual Life\n  Happiness = +-sqrt(Perception * Skill * Circumstance / Others&#x27; Actual Life)\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not certain about the negative root there; maybe that&#x27;s depression? Otherwise, looking at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Square_root_0_25.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Square_root_0_25.svg</a>, it seems reasonable; improving one of perception/skill/circumstance if it&#x27;s near-zero will improve your happiness drastically, but it&#x27;s a relatively slow-growing function so improving happiness after that has diminishing returns.<p>Also, as you mention we never defined the terms. I believe all of these are generally measured on self-administered surveys with &quot;rate X&quot; scales, and so are just percentages with no units.<p>Finally, the terms don&#x27;t have any obvious correlations with the post, so I just stuck in the things that were mentioned that seemed relevant:<p>* Happiness - see eqn., you can&#x27;t affect this directly<p>* Skill - conscientiousness, self-esteem, optimism, feelings of purpose and fulfillment<p>* Others&#x27; Actual Life - income and wealth<p>* Circumstance - genes (health?), extroversion, &quot;flow&quot;<p>* Perception - paying attention to your situation/actions/feelings and in particular adjusting your estimates of success/failure chance to match reality (humans deal very badly with probabilities) - includes &quot;agreeableness&quot; (understanding of others), &quot;memory&quot; (perceptions of self being happy), and &quot;mindfulness&quot; (perceptions of world)",1405882812

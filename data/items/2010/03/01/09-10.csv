There are several studies that show this. Example:<p><a href=""http://www.springerlink.com/content/t96qmxyaa7x7le0c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springerlink.com/content/t96qmxyaa7x7le0c/</a><p><i>Subjects were divided into four groups: a low repetition group (Low Rep, n=9) performing 3–5 repetitions maximum (RM) for four sets of each exercise with 3 min rest between sets and exercises, an intermediate repetition group (Int Rep, n=11) performing 9–11 RM for three sets with 2 min rest, a high repetition group (High Rep, n=7) performing 20–28 RM for two sets with 1 min rest, and a non-exercising control group (Con, n=5). (...) Maximal strength improved significantly more for the Low Rep group compared to the other training groups, and the maximal number of repetitions at 60% 1RM improved the most for the High Rep group.</i>",1267437402

Of course you can prevent it in some ways, but then it is no longer just ""subtracting 250 kCal"". Nutrition is complex, so I would not give advice this simplified about it, as it can get you in trouble, just as putting 15lbs weight in a month. Maybe you have good genetics, or already follow a well-balanced diet, but people who follow your advice not necessarily so, they should thus pay more attention to this aspect of ""training"". I learned this lesson the hard way, so I wish the advice in ""Starting Strength"" would be more balanced in this respect.",1267437073

1158421,comment,1156838,1156838,0,0,BjornW,,,"I've started with searching for a martial art fitting for me 2,5 years ago. I hadn't been training for a quite some time and I really needed to do something about it. I had practiced Judo during my child and early teen years and practiced Tae Kwon Do during college.<p>I quit both because, in my personal opinion they are too focused on doing one thing fairly well while more or less ignoring other aspects of fighting. For example: I found it very annoying that Judo did not allow any punches or kicks. While Tae Kwon Do didn't allow throws or ground fighting. \nBasically I was looking for a different look at fighting, be it kicking, punching, locks, throws or fighting with weapons. In my view everything should be possible depending on the context. At that time I found two possible matches (in my neighborhood) for what I was looking for in a martial art: Takeda Ryu and Krav Maga. After having followed three lessons of Takeda Ryu I didn't bother of looking at Krav Maga anymore since Takeda Ryu and the people training at the dojo matched what I was looking for.<p>So now I have been training Takeda Ryu Kobilza Ha for 2,5 years. I'm still just a beginner and need to learn a lot, but I enjoy training very much and that's what I consider to be the most important. Whatever martial art you like to start make sure you enjoy it and feel safe in the dojo.<p>I have the impression that it does have an effect on me outside the dojo, although I find it hard to describe what the effect exactly is.<p>Currently I'm practicing five budo disciplines in Takeda Ryu Kobilza Ha:<p>- Aikido (throws, locks )\n - Iaido (swiftly drawing the sword and cutting correctly)\n - Jodo (fighting with a stick)\n - Jukempo (kicking, punching combined with throws and locks) \n - Kendo (fighting with a drawn sword)<p>If you would like to know more about Takeda Ryu, have a look at <a href=""http://istb.info/index.php/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://istb.info/index.php/home.html</a> or look at some footage of demonstrations: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INx_CSA_I78"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INx_CSA_I78</a> and our main event in Vienna Austria: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sxtTNjKSsk&#38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sxtTNjKSsk&#38</a>;<p>ps: This is my own very personal and limited look at martial arts and I do not want to disrespect any Judo, Tae Kwon Do, Krav Maga or any other martial art practitioners.",1267436584
1158420,comment,1157681,1157723,0,0,biotech,,,"A stackoverflow for researchers in biotech/medicine/biology would be extremely useful. In biological research, if someone wants to do an experiment that they are not experienced in, they can review peer-reviewed published materials, but many important details are left out. There are many matters of technique, and many decisions about which protocol/solution/tool/etc to use for the experiment that may not be easily accessible via published sources. In these situations, a well-connected biological researcher would ask a colleague who is experienced in the particular experiment. This is not always so easy though, and much time can be wasted re-discovering a simple issue that many others already knew.<p>In software, this kind of knowledge has been available online for years. In other technology fields, this is not the case. A easy-to-use, well designed forum like stackoverflow for biology research could be a real boon for the field.

1158412,comment,1157440,1158001,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> No. Do not want.<p>Ok fair point. But it's worth considering; if I were a US citizen I really dont think I would sit much longer and endure the POS channels they have there (sorry to keep picking on the US - but they are the worst offenders by far).<p>> I can agree that some good programming ...<p>Oh it's more important than that.<p>The BBC are meant to be politically neutral - and they do a reasonably good job of being so. Better than anyone else by far.<p>It also funds the BBC website - which is easily one of the best news sites around (note how often it gets submitted here, and upvoted, as opposed to other general news sites :))<p>Additionally it funds iPlayer - HD streaming of BBC content. Again, yet to see a commercial offering as slick.<p>Finally the tax funds Ofcomm which regulates all TV - I think this is one of the main reasons we aren't suffering shoddy corrupted TV :D<p>There is a broader benefit as well. People are used to solid hours of content with no advertising on te BBC - which means other channels cant get away with as much as certain other countries cram in. Example: Channel 5 shows CSI from 9pm on Tuesdays. It has 10-12 minutes of advertising between segments and finishes at 9:50pm. In the US that fills a whole hour timeslot - they get 100% more advertising (20m) more than us.<p>So, yeh, I think it's a great deal for what you get (7 BBC channels and guaranteed between 3 and 10 other, well regulated, free-to-air channels plus the BBC website). Certainly I'd never consider paying for cable channels in the way other countries do :(",1267436366

Let's say your browser allows 4 connections you will be able to fetch four resources in parallel. \nUsing CDN (with a different hostname) allows you to circumvent that.

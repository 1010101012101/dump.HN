I just imagine it will complicate platform integration & bleed money given that it is in js (plus API headaches abound, as you mention)... If the same concept of dynamic provision/deploy/process/collect could all be done from a Java/C++ app I&#x27;d be very intrigued, but I suspect it is already near possible or achieved trivially through AWS APIs, albeit it probably with a manual deploy involved.<p>I think I remember this concept in Matlab back from when I did some research in grad school -- basically an instance of Matlab can be setup as a compute server, and the parallel processing functions of Matlab code on other computers can portion out work to it. This is the ideal model in my mind.<p>1. Write high-performance code in any language with some function that should be happening remotely in parallel.<p>2. Configure AWS to auto-provision the resources necessary.<p>3. Execute code, have it behave as if it is all running locally.<p>Really all these things can already be achieved with SOA, RMI, message queues, etc., the trick is just in making it transparent to the programmer so there is no deploy step involved. With the right spec it could even become platform agnostic (change small config file somewhere to target different cloud platform... would be nice to see a JSR about that in the near future!).",1421132343

She also helped organize a revolt in Austin against charter schools a couple of years ago, which led to the replacement of the entire school board in the next election, and cancelling the contracts with at least some of the charter schools in the city. She&#x27;s a friend whose opinions I respect, certainly on an issue where she is vastly better educated than I, so I was more inclined to listen to her, despite having a relatively strongly held belief that charters and market-oriented solutions were the right way forward for education.<p>She thoroughly convinced me, that at least in the case of IDEA (the company that was contracted in Austin) charter schools were not superior, <i>especially</i> for the students most in need of better schools.<p>Her arguments, backed by data (though I&#x27;d be hard pressed to find it again, since it&#x27;s been a couple of years), included pointing out that IDEA schools had performed better specifically because they&#x27;d expelled and otherwise removed from their student pool the students least likely to perform well.<p>This served two goals for the charter schools: It insured their standard test performance would be better, and insured that the surrounding public schools (which are required by law to accept those students IDEA had refused to teach) performed more poorly on average, regardless of how well they teach.<p>Similarly, the special needs programs in public schools must accommodate children that charter schools aren&#x27;t required to accommodate, often through exceptions and guidelines built into the charter program by the legislators who have ideological reasons for wanting more privatization of schools, received contributions from the very companies that will operate the charter schools, and have every reason to see charter schools work, at least on paper.<p>In the case in Austin, there was a pretty wide variety of benefits the charters received that the public schools they replaced did not. For example, a large budget was provided to renovate schools for the charter; when those same school buildings had been in service as public schools for decades, and the budgets were woefully inadequate to keep it up to date. Students obviously do better with better facilities.<p>I&#x27;m still open-minded about the possibility of alternative schools. I hate public school, as I know it; always have, as I was very poorly served by public schools (as a bright kid with a learning disability). But, when the political/economic deck is stacked soundly in favor of the charter school, as it was in the one case I really studied, if they perform about the same or slightly better than public schools, I have to assume that the only benefit is to the corporations making a profit on the schools.<p>My confidence in market solutions to problems like education has somewhat waned in the face of evidence that the market tends to favor the best students and forgets those that are challenging. I don&#x27;t know what the right solution is, but I&#x27;m mistrustful of the motivations of the charters I&#x27;ve seen.",1421131506

With this statistic in mind you&#x27;d think the lawless streets of Canada would be far more violent and dangerous than those of the U.S., but exactly the opposite is the case.  Something strange is going on in the U.S..<p>The best theory I&#x27;ve seen put forth is that prison&#x27;s are a booming for-profit industry in the U.S., and profits breed corruption.

The child incarceration rate was apparently not naturally high enough to support the prison, so steps were taken.<p>If a top to bottom examination of the U.S.&#x27;s justice system were made, there is little doubt that prison time is handed out more liberally than is warranted to deter and rehabilitate criminals. So, the fact that there are more prisons than colleges in your nation <i>should</i> seem alarming rather &quot;reasonable&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m Canadian, and we&#x27;re starting to see american style prisons, longer sentences, and a correspondingly higher incarceration rate with higher security prisons and, worst of all, proportionally more prisoners in solitary confinement.  Our politicians make hay on being &quot;tough on crime&quot; even when all evidence suggests longer sentences provide no deterrent to first-time or repeat offenders. There is increasing evidence that solitary confinement, besides being inhumane, acts against the interests of rehabilitation. Canada, and many other nations as well, need to observe what&#x27;s gone wrong in the U.S.&#x27;s justice system so that they can avoid making the same mistakes.  In Canada, there were two private correctional facilities, but both have reverted to government control.  This is good, but private prison companies continue to lobby the government for contract business.  They must be denied.

8878471,comment,8875202,8877593,0,0,jahewson,,,"a) I don&#x27;t see how a piece of software which has essentially not changed for twenty years is a &quot;good example of stability&quot;. Stability in the face of what? Real software occupies a constantly changing world and TeX is sheltered from that by the surrounding third-party tools. TeX&#x27;s stability would only be impressive of it were <i>changing</i> or growing while still retaining it&#x27;s original functionality. Anybody can refuse to update a program and declare it to be stable - there&#x27;s no lesson for me as an engineer, beyond just refusing to write code.<p>b) I don&#x27;t understand this claim that TeX is bug free - there have been 947 documented bugs in TeX, with 427 of them occurring after TeX82. There was at least at least one bug in TeX found every year until 1995 and over a dozen have been found since then - in a code base which <i>hasn&#x27;t changed</i>. The number of bugs in TeX as a percentage of the number of lines doesn&#x27;t seem to be unusually low, and given that very little development has been done in the past 26 years, there has been very little chance of introducing new bugs. Once again, I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m supposed to be learning from TeX as an engineer other than refusing to write code.<p>c) I&#x27;m not talking about clojure, I&#x27;m talking about TeX. I agree that there are few examples of fast, high quality typesetting software. But TeX is still slow - it does so much file I/O because it assumes a tiny amount of RAM. A modern rewrite could be 10 times faster, I reckon.<p>d) By definition it&#x27;s a language that almost nobody is familiar with - and that&#x27;s a problem. After some careful study, I am now familiar with it, but it&#x27;s still very hard to read a program which is structured to be read as a book. Once cannot skim read the code or get a good understanding of its fundamental structure as a program. Instead one is always trapped in Knuth&#x27;s narrative. I don&#x27;t want to read a book - I want to read a program, and web makes that practically impossible. The end result is neither a program nor a book, and is unwieldy to programmer and reader alike - indeed, literate programming never caught on.<p>The software I really admire is software which has reacted to change, modernised, improved. Even Microsoft Windows is a great example of stability in the long run. TeX isn&#x27;t, because it hasn&#x27;t done any of those things. It still compiles - and its very good a typesetting - but as an exercise in writing code, it offers few relevant lessons to the modern programmer.",1421130898

They are looking forward to their adult life, and putting childhood behind. They often seek a college away from their home region, as part of asserting their independence.<p>Most people who end up in jail didn&#x27;t get there voluntarily. Sure, we could reduce the number of jails significantly. The majority of them are fairly small local facilities, serving a city or a county, and their population often is mostly people serving less than a year, or people who have not even been convicted yet but either could not make bail or are being held on charges too serious to allow bail. It would probably be more efficient to close all of those and move those prisoners to a few big facilities.<p>I don&#x27;t think most of the affected prisoners would like that, though. It would make it a lot harder for their families to visit them. It would make it harder for those awaiting trial to meet with their lawyers.<p>I think it would be best if we had enough jails and prisons to allow most prisoners to be kept somewhere within a couple hours travel from their family, so that their spouse, kids, and friends can reasonably visit them every visiting day.",1421129912

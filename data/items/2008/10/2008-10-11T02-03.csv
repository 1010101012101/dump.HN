329462,comment,329447,329447,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"To be blunt, there are a lot of people out there who just blame the U.S. for everything.  That doesn't mean the world hates us it just means they don't want to blame themselves and we're the most visible target.<p>The truth is, ironically, this is one of those unique situations where the U.S. would have fallen alone if the rest of the world had ignored what our irresponsible lenders were doing.  This crisis, thus far, is limited entirely to the banking industry (other people are over reacting to it but the only industry that's actually faltering are the banks).  Which means banks in Europe would be fine had they not (a) made the same mistakes and (b) bought up packages that contained loans they knew weren't solvent.",1223692650
329461,comment,329023,329307,0,0,nandemo,,,"People who support themselves by trading successfully are likely working for a company (bank or hedge fund, etc). Often they are dealers, who make money on the bid-ask spread, so they don't bear as much risk as (say) traders working on prop desks. These depend more on the success of their trades for their income, but even so they get a non-negative income.
Now, independent day traders working in their underwear is a different story. Not only they bear all the risk of their trades, they're likely ""losers"" (in the game theory sense) in average.",1223692464

I'm not one of the conspiracy theorists.  :-)<p>The strong euro definitely hurt the software industry and I suppose other fields where there were ""soft"" products targeted at international markets.

Your post makes me think further that we are not even considering the emerging market opportunities wrt e-commerce. Most people in developing nations don't have credit cards or easy means of doing e-commerce, but its definitely getting there. Lots of scope, and entrepreneurs in the valley should definitely also focus on these markets and get in early with market specific products.",1223690466

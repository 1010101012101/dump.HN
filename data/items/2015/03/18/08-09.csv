9224244,comment,9219742,9219742,0,0,osirisr,,,"SOME UBER APP IDEAS:<p>* An app that allows people to search up the products of small local businesses near by, pay for them via mobile, and then have it delivered to them via a trusted Uber driver. Good for small businesses since they wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford a fleet of cars. Uber delivery will increase business since they will no longer be limited by their location.<p>* Tinder integration would be perfect. Users can agree upon a location via a google map in the app, and then schedule Uber drivers to pick them both up (option to share ride too). No need for either person to reveal their address to the other. Will make participants feel more safe.<p>* Vacation package integration. Not sure if this is already being done, but vacation packages can now include a dedicated Uber driver, along with the standard hotel + plane package. Will make vacations even smoother.<p>* Office lunch app uber integration. An app that lets co-workers pool money together to order lunch from local restaurants, and then have it delivered via Uber. Business for restaurant is increased since they are no longer limited by seating capacity (esp during high volume times - business plaza at 12pm for example).<p>* This idea is a combination of some of the others. Pizza Hut, Domionos, Chinese restaurants all do delivery... why not all of the other restaurants? Imagine an app that aggregates a bunch of restaurants and allows users to place orders. As the food is being prepared the app calculates all the nearby Uber drivers, the delivery locations, etc. It then finds the most efficient &#x27;load&#x27; for a single Uber driver to carry. For example, pickup food from restaurants A B R since the drop off locations are all near to each other. This allows an Uber driver to take food from more than 1 restaurant to more than 1 customer, maximizing the amount of $$ they can make and decreasing cost for the end customer.",1426667726

Is this changing? Yes. I feel that this will be much less of a problem for our children given the advent of toys like Goldiblox and even Lego sets aimed for girls. However I feel that this doesn&#x27;t change the present situation for adults.<p>> Does it have to do with how you perceive these various vocations?<p>Yes because I&#x27;ve lived outside of places like Silicon Valley, in metros with a more conventional and old mindset.<p>> Is this feeling rooted in personal experience(s) and memories?<p>Yes outside of Silicon Valley it is strongly encouraged that engineers transition to management. It just isn&#x27;t as respected outside of tech hubs and it&#x27;s pretty recent. Is this changing for the better? It depends on the metro and the rate of change in perception varies.<p>> Be open to the likelihood that your experiences don&#x27;t generalize to others.<p>I am definitely open to my generalizations being incorrect in many different places and times. I&#x27;m just stating what I feel is the general mass trend.<p>> I posted this elsewhere in the thread--I don&#x27;t know if you saw it, but the Harris poll actually released some numbers not too long ago on the notion of prestige in various occupations<p>Looking that this poll and several other similar studies over the decades, my hypothesis has been proven wrong. Thanks for posting quantitative data. Yeah polls are subject to a lot of errors. Still, they&#x27;re better than guesses based on personal experience. Logically I&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;ve been proven wrong. However what&#x27;s annoying though is that even in light of data, I still feel that I&#x27;m &#x27;correct&#x27;. My gut still tells me that engineering is still seen by the masses as low prestige (outside of tech hubs like Silicon Valley). If I were to rationalize it, I would say that popular media is the main driving force behind my opinion. It&#x27;s hard to ignore annoying shows like The Big Bang Theory. Ugh, I really hate that show. Another reason is that I feel the polls are measuring prestige incorrectly. imo A political office is very prestigious, yet in these polls they score so low. Why? Because the way the researchers measure prestige includes perception of ethics and generalized likability.",1426667243

The particular decision in this case might well be ill-informed, but I think any judgement that the Unicode Consortium is engaging in cultural supremacism (as opposed to doing the usual thing of wanting anglo-american capitalist money) is somewhat far-fetched.<p>The right solution, I think, would be to replace Unicode with a truly intrinsically variable-length standard such as an unbounded UTF-8 - many of the arguments that were fielded in favour of having the option of fixed-width encodings seem to have melted away now that almost everything that interfaces with users has a layer of high-level glue code, naive implementations of strings have been deemed harmful to security and even ostensibly &quot;embedded&quot; platforms can get away with Java. Rather than having an overwhelmed committee of American industrialists decide over the faith of every single codepoint, then, they could simply allocate a prefix to every catalogued writing system and defer the rest to non-technical authorities whose suggested lists would only require basic rubber-stamp sanity-checking.<p>> &quot;You can&#x27;t write your name in your native language, but at least you can tweet your frustration with an emoji face that&#x27;s the same shade of brown as yours!&quot;<p>This seems fairly characteristic of the apparent belief of social justice activists - and I can&#x27;t imagine that Unicode&#x27;s inclusion of skin colours would be a result of anything other than pressure by the same - that they can improve the whole world with remedies conceived against the background of US American race/identity politics.",1426666598

Especially when they actually requested them in the first place (we get 10-20 suggestions PER DAY).<p>The statement, ""...they would not appreciate any major changes no matter how clever/creative/useful you think they are"" seems to indicate that you might think the best source of ideas is you-- not your users.<p>IMO, the majority of ideas that you implement should come from your users.

118556,comment,118106,118388,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Well, thanks it's sort of nice to get all those advice. Just... I'm not exactly a newbie. Like mentioned above I already have worked a decade with VS (and started programming more than 20 years ago). And I'm used to those keybindings very much by now and not only have no problem with them, but I actually do like them. Really. Not the least because nearly identical bindings work in nearly every single modern application on Windows, Linux and even on most Applications on the Web.<p>The reason I had to leave VS behind is that it's not available for other systems and I also I didn't like VS so much anyway beside it's editor and it's debugger. I can live with smaller changes - so I have for example no problem working with kate and CodeBlocks. But they are still not as powerful as the VS editor had been. Emacs probably is - from all I heard it's even way beyond all of them.<p>But for all the power it might offer, for a start I would already be glad with simple familiar keymappings :-) I think people who had to work with VS and come from emacs (that stuff happens sometimes) know the feeling and therefore emacs keybindings exist for VS. I'm just looking for something the other way round. Though by now I guess that it's not yet available.<p>If I like the editor afterwards, well maybe I learn the original keymappings then also someday. But for a start I would just prefer it to work with the keys I like and know.<p>And I'm not afraid of Lisp - not the least bit ;-)",1203382188

UNIXes are better, but still at the mercy of morons (Acrobat has managed to drop files called ""C:\nppdf32Log\debuglog.txt"" all over my home directory, so it's probably just as well it's too fucking stupid to realise it's running on RHEL otherwise it'd be asking for root all the time instead)",1351076368
4692398,comment,4691283,4691283,4,0,netcan,,,"When Apple's  designs have been good (or any company's really), others are usually quick to copy. Philosophy is surprisingly hard to emulate though. One of the things that has made Apple successful has been its tendency to make a decision about the ""right way"" to do X, especially when X is new. The size of an ipad, no stylus or keyboard on the iphone. 15"" laptops are exclusively high end A lot of the time this is infuriatingly eliminates options for the consumer. It does result in <i>an</i> excellent option, pre-picked & perfected.<p>It's what has given Apple their ""radical"" feel.<p>MS has a lot of money. Good margins compared to PC manufacturers. They can afford to be a little bold. Here instead of offering two different keyboards (or no keyboard) and letting consumers choose, figure out which one works better. Make the perfect keyboard for a touch device. Most consumers have never had one of these devices before. Their guess at whether or not<p>Apple told us the best option was no keyboard. Android me-tooed. If Microsoft have a better answer, I'd like to see them champion it with confidence. Commit to the design. Letting the market decide is great and given a choice between intelligent design only and evolution only, I'd go with evolution. But, I'd rather have both. Since MS is leaving its world of software to create a machine that demonstrates its new OS parading, I'd like to see them treading confidently.<p>just do it Microsoft.",1351076348

That you didn't have to worry about your resume anymore, career, networking, keeping skills up-to-date, you never had to say yes to anything to make a buck only if it interested you, etc. It did not necessarily mean you were saying that to your neighborhood, society, country, family, etc. Indeed it could enable to give more time and energy to those things.

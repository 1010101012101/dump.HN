And I guess there are not so much players in that market that can develop such cure without any help. Research itself is expencive and nobody can just state he created cure for cancer and let people test it. They need much money to make it legal medicine. Can you tell me how much people/institution has enough resources to do that?<p>Moreover I guess medicine is quite homogenous as a science. What if way they are looking for that cure is simply wrong? What if law specifies wrong ways of testing drugs? Is it easy to change the law? If way of looking is wrong, I guess it's extremely hard to get money for research since people who decide rather trust the science. If law don't let find cure, I think it's even more difficult.",1342079789

For sure it's very easy and safe strategy to keep status quo. What if cause of cancer would be found and it would no longer come back after treatment?

One reason for not writing functional tests though is that they are way harder to write than unit tests (assuming that your unit tests are relatively straightforward because your code is well factored)<p>I always find starting functional tests, especially in a new area of your program, to be a tremendous exercise. Maybe I'm doing it wrong. For example, last week we moved on to writing code that hits an sftp server - so our functional test spins up an sftp server locally & overrides the product code settings so that it connects to that. Getting this set up and working took me a couple of days, and this is such a tiny aspect of the code under test that I'm afraid I'm exhausting my teammates patience for ""test first functional tests"".<p>In other areas e.g. hobbyist opengl code, I think this initial barrier to getting started is so high (you'd have to write a sort of machine vision thing to analyse the actual output, rather than just what opengl calls were made) that truly end-to-end tests are a complete nonstarter. You have to give in and settle for integration tests instead.<p>I suspect many people are in that same place with regard to functional testing of web apps. Yes there are tools like selenium, but there are issues of test data & making sure product code connects to test databases. There are solveable, but people don't see that the value is greater than the costs of wrestling with that.",1342076454

109353,comment,108794,108830,0,0,pg,,,"<i>Software should be copyrighted, but not patented.</i><p>So physical stuff like valves can be patented, but not software?  That seems arbitrary.  After all, it's usually the design of the valve that contains the invention.  What difference does it make if you print one out?  If you mean ""nothing should be patented,"" just say that.  One could make a case for that argument.  But there's nothing special about software.<p><i>How did we end up in this mess?</i><p>What evidence do you have that we're in a mess?  Have you ever been prevented from doing something you wanted to because of patents?<p>The fact is, for all the noise people make about them, software patents just don't matter much.  Large companies accumulate patent portfolios to protect themselves against patent suits.  Startups file for them because investors and acquirers are impressed by them.  But they don't decide which startups win.",1202165713

We interact a lot - it's not like there's some huge dividing line.  But the developers adapt to changes in the database - we don't push objects out to the database.  So maybe we've set ourselves up for this problem.<p>This brings up a new question,though - is version control for a database another palliative for a broken system?  In other words, if you have to version the database along with the code, have you already made a mistake?<p>In my case, there's no avoiding this ""mistake"", so I will definitely be discussing this idea with the DB team, for sure.",1202163702

During the maintenance part of our job, it would be really nice to have type declarations on variables.  For maintenance, the more dependable information we have, the better!  The fewer things that can escape as runtime exceptions, the better!  Not having static typing makes new development faster, but maintenance is harder.  What would be ideal is an optional typing system like Strongtalk.  As parts of the system mature, they would become statically typed.  This gives us the best of both worlds.",1202163085

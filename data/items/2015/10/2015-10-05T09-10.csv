It&#x27;s a truly excellent calculator which puts the TIs to shame. It&#x27;s a calculator with a modern multitouch interface so you can use pinch-to-zoom on graphs, etc.<p>It uses the xCas engine[1] as a backend and has a spiffy calculator frontend, so you can write formulas as they would appear in a textbook.<p>EDIT: It also has an ARM processor, IIRC around 300MHz. It really shows when graphing complex equations, where the TIs take forever. I hear the newest TI nSpire ones have a slightly more modern CPU, but I really hate the interface there (it&#x27;s no longer really a calculator for me, but a shitty tablet).<p>If you want an actual physical calculator, I strongly recommend this one.<p>[0] <a href=""http://h41336.www4.hp.com/hpprime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://h41336.www4.hp.com/hpprime</a>

2. In the backend, a project is based on a template system. It&#x27;s not visible to the user yet as this concept further needs adjustments before we can roll it out . In fact the current project design is just our first &quot;plugin&quot; of how a project can look. We hope to offer multiple ways to visualize a project in the future.<p>The state field is a system state (not changeable) that is used for triggers and in the future reporting. When you tick of a Task as finished, a trigger occurs that will look up the column with the system state &quot;Completed&quot; and move the task there.

It&#x27;s also meaningless.<p>It seems to me that anything making the broad claim that this generic is a &#x27;pure artifact of regulation&#x27; must also be against patents, trademarks, copyright and other similar monopolies backed by the power of the state. Are these not also all pure artifacts of regulation?<p>But perhaps those regulations are somehow &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;fair&quot;, so I&#x27;ll put that argument aside. This piece says:<p>> which he cleverly amplified by sharp practices described by Ronald Bailey: “First, he apparently talked Impax [a predecessor holder of the sole FDA rights to market Daraprim] into starving the wholesale market of the drug, so that when Turing completed its purchase of the rights there were no extra pills floating around. Next, he set up an exclusive distribution network as a way of preventing potential competitors from obtaining enough Daraprim to conduct [the equivalence] trials for the FDA” necessary to develop an ANDA so as eventually to challenge his regulatory monopoly.<p>See that part about &#x27;exclusive distribution network&#x27;, which is praised as a &#x27;sharp practice&#x27;? How did that get to be there? If the FDA prevented closed distribution, then other companies could get the supply needed to demonstrate that their copy was sufficiently similar. While that wouldn&#x27;t prevent price jacking, it would lower how high the price could be jacked.<p>So long as companies are required to demonstrate biosimilarity and have no way to get access to the materials needed to demonstrate biosimilarity, then there&#x27;s a problem. If you think demonstrating biosimilarity is the problem then you think regulation are in the way (and you&#x27;re fine letting people distribute snake oil as a replacement for a tested drug). If you think that restricted access to the drugs is the problem, then you think that the regulations we have should be tweaked.<p>This piece only looks at the former, and praises the latter.",1444038791

It seems only a fair deal to me.

I really like the way IPFS breaks down the problem, so the components remain the same.<p>Regarding incentivization, looking at the literature, you can split existing incentive schemes into two camps, local and global. Tit-for-tat would be an example of a local scheme, currency based systems would be global.<p>Neither of these types of scheme really work, with local schemes, you have no way to use accrued reputation with new nodes. Global schemes require too much coordination and overhead to be suitable for small &#x27;transactions&#x27;.<p>As I understand it, IPFS deals with the problem by having a local scheme, but with a get out clause. If you want something you may have to do work on behalf of the node you want something from, but that work should be easier if you have a good reputation with other nodes in the network.<p>Under my proposed system, nodes keep track of how much they are in debt or in credit with the nodes that they are in contact with. The amount that you can go into debt with another node is limited to 1% of the amount of useful data that you have transferred to that node. (This way, if a node terminates a connection whilst it is in debt to another node, that loss, amortized over the useful data that you have received is very small). Nodes are incentivized keep connections open, since short lived connections have very tight reins on how much debt/credit can be accrued.<p>As this stands, this doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. It&#x27;s entirely local and there&#x27;s no way to initiate connections since nodes, by default, don&#x27;t trust each other.<p>The solution is two-fold: credit transfer and proof of work. I have designed a protocol that allows nodes to transfer credit to cancel out &#x27;cycles of debt&#x27;. Nodes can also gain credit with other nodes by solving pointless problems. The innovation here is that when confronted with a puzzle, a node is able to delegate the work to its debtors. Proof of work is useful since, given the choice, a node would probably prefer to use its upstream bandwidth than burn up CPU time.<p>There are more details to this, like: the specifics of how to discover and execute a credit transfer along a long chain using only local interactions, how to incentive routing as well as data transfer and many other things.<p>If I had the time, I&#x27;d implement it.",1444038433

Instead if you e.g. want a graph from -3:3 on the X axis, you probably also set up the Y axis as -3:3 too. Since the real screen isn&#x27;t 1:1, this will result in the graph being squashed down.<p>And except for the special case of lines that are parallel with the screen edges, a stretched or squashed aspect ratio would indeed distort the angles such that you can&#x27;t tell which angles are perpendicular and which ones aren&#x27;t.",1444038378

The asteroid would have to be small enough that the bomb could fragment it sufficiently, we&#x27;d also have to be able to hit it early enough and fragment it enough that most of the fragments would miss the earth. If the asteroid was above the fragmentation capability of the warhead, or if it was detected late enough that the fragments would mostly still hit the earth then it wouldn&#x27;t help.<p>Bear in mind that if most of the fragments still hit earth, the net energy delivery would still be about the same. This could actually be worse for the planet as a whole than a single hit. Finally, whether such a bomb could be effective would also depend on the structure of the asteroid or comet. This is due to the bugsplat effect, army slang for the fact that when a bomb hits a building or vehicle, the energy seems to be expended very asymmetrically. If you crush a bug with your boot, one part of the exoskeleton will weaken before the others and the insides get sprayed out in that direction. Similarly, if a bomb hits a vehicle often the majority of the explosive effect tends to get directed primarily in one direction. There are cases of people close to one side of a vehicle surviving unharmed, while people much further away in other directions get incinerated or hit by fragments. Similarly if the internal structure of the asteroid is asymmetrical, you could end up with material on one side of the asteroid (perhaps made up of already loose boulder material and dust) being thoroughly fragmented while larger more dense parts of it on the other surviving. Instead of many similarly sized fragments, you might well end up with a large percentage of the object remaining intact and all you did was scrub off looser material.",1444037620

UUNet had just connected to the internet backbone and we chatted with them briefly about connecting up with them.  They said as long as we paid for a T1 from Toronto, they would let us work with them.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this was before AlterNet, so it would have had to have been prior to 1990.  IIRC, the cost to us would have been about $30K per month and we considered the option of starting up a commercial ISP.

It does pretty plots but that&#x27;s about it (I generally use gnuplot for that, and it has more useful tools than Desmos has, albeit a bit difficult to use and discover).<p>Back in my high school days, I was pretty bad ass with the TI-85 graphing calculator, to the point that I felt like cheating because I could easily use it to solve and verify most exercises and exams. I could have learned a whole lot more maths had I not had such a powerful calculator. And it wasn&#x27;t even one of the fancy symbolic calculators that high school kids these days have.<p>The last time I put my TI through its paces was in university orbital mechanics class where I used it to do initial orbit determination of an asteroid based on three observations. That wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without a powerful calculator, with variables in memory and such.<p>These days my calculator has fallen into disuse because I need it so irregularly that I don&#x27;t have a good reason to carry it around. But it would be great to have something as powerful in my pocket at all times.",1444037349

Back then things were made of levers and pulleys, so all the tech predictions are solutions to problems using this particular hammer. In our time, it&#x27;s an app. Would anyone pre 1950 have predicted that just about everything is going to be turned into numbers? Even our mechanical stuff like servos and combustion engines are controlled by calculating machines. At the same time, you tend to think you&#x27;re at a fundamental level, wherever you are: who here doesn&#x27;t think that information science (algorithms, Shannon limits, calculability) are fundamental advances that will continue to be relevant forever? Well, 100 years ago people also thought they&#x27;d figured it out and that we were just about to finish physics. Then quantum and relativity came about and turned everything over. (Heck, the Romans thought they&#x27;d figured it out.)<p>- A rather major revolution during the last 100 years is in materials. This changes what just about everything is made of, what can be made, and what it costs to make. Also strangely unappreciated.<p>- Aesthetics are hard to predict. People in the pics are wearing similar clothes and living in similar style houses to the illustrators. Ultimately economics and social memes open up various kinds of aesthetics, but it&#x27;s still very hard to say what people will think is nice. Look at flat UI. We can have skeumorphic, but for some reason we stopped that.<p>- Similarly, moral opinions change. Our view of execution has changed. Homophobia is now wrong. Premarital sex is easier to get. There&#x27;s a whole load of atheists out in the open. Seahorse racing is considered animal cruelty.<p>- Economics has changed enormously. Both the theory and the demographics. Keynes was years from writing the Consequences of the Peace. Friedman was not born yet. Most people don&#x27;t have servants. Automation did happen with washing machines and dishwashers.

An overview, where you can see the status and progress of all the projects at a glance. Right now, as far as I can tell, the only info the overview page gives about the projects is the project name and participants. I&#x27;d love to be able to see which columns were completed in the overview page.<p>2. Project templates. I want to have a few different project types, each type of which loads a default set of columns, colors, and tasks.<p>One final observation is that I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;state&quot; field of the columns does. Changing the state doesn&#x27;t seem to have any visible effect. For my purposes I&#x27;d like each of the columns to represent project stages and for it to be very meaningful when we&#x27;ve moved from one project state to the next.<p>Looking forward to seeing future iterations of this project!

With globalization, a billion or more rural people in Asia could be recruited into the urban industrial sector and produce the tradeable goods that undersell the goods hitherto produced in the United States and Europe. Until this new Asian labour is wholly absorbed and its wages rise to Western levels, U.S. and European unskilled wages will remain depressed and the share of profits in value added will rise. Ironically, while this sharpens inequality in the West, it promotes equality on a world scale as Asian and eventually also African peoples are lifted out of misery.&quot;

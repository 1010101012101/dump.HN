Or as I prefer to think of it:  security threat vector channel.<p>Consider:  You&#x27;ve got a slew of products for which rapid iteration and obsolescence is a key attribute, profit margins are slim, cost pressures are immense, talent is limited (and not attracted by time and cost pressures), parts availability is arbitrary, capricious, and liable to change with little notice or reason (we&#x27;ve seen in the GM ignition switch recall what the implications of even a minor parts change can be, in a slightly different space).<p>A few years back I had the distinct pleasure of attempting to configure and deploy a major enterprise vendor&#x27;s storage product on what the sales team promised, but the support team denied at pain of abuse to my firm, was supported under our OS.  The company shall remain nameless, but rhymes with &quot;hell&quot;.<p>What I eventually established was:<p>• The vendor itself had little or no real understanding of the equipment or its configuration.<p>• The documentation for the underlying technologies (all, as it happens, open source free software), ranged from quite good to abysmal.  One README file consisted entirely of the text &quot;Good things to read here.&quot;.  We were less than gruntled.<p>• True support was actually a pass-through to the OS vendor, who, it turned out, wasn&#x27;t in fact the source of our OS.  We&#x27;d been sold something which didn&#x27;t in fact exist (real support).<p>And that was for high-end enterprise-grade hardware.<p>The situation for the consumer-grade stuff, especially the <i>cheap</i> consumer-grade stuff, is far, far worse.<p>Which is why I want the products I buy to have the absolute minimal amount of technology in them as possible or necessary.

Perhaps in another 5 or 10 years it will emerge as something beautiful without any vestigial appendages.<p>What&#x27;s interesting from a language perspective is that the C++ folks seem to take the approach of &quot;ugly is better&quot; by essentially not breaking backwards compatibility like Python 3 and Perl 6 did.

That is, what would you suggest to get to that place without the straightjacket?<p>Duh, Lisp of course.  (Or Haskell.)<p>> Note that at a bare minimum, these supposed tools should give the ability for fine-grained manual resource control<p>Check.  Lisp provides garbage collection, but you don&#x27;t have to use it.  It&#x27;s perfectly possible to write Lisp programs that do manual memory management.  It isn&#x27;t often done because it&#x27;s hardly ever a win, but if you really want to you can.<p>> zero-(runtime)-cost abstractions<p>a.k.a. macros<p>> and performance roughly on-par with C++.<p>The SBCL compiler is pretty good.  But one of the reasons that Lisp code is not generally as fast as C/C++ is that Lisp code is safe by default whereas C/C++ code is not.  You can make Lisp code unsafe (and hence faster) but you have to work at it, just as you can make C/C++ code safe, but you have to work at it.  I submit that in today&#x27;s world, being safe and a bit slower by default might not be such a bad place to be in the design space.<p>>  these are all things that tend to be written in C++ or plain C.<p>There is a world of difference between C++ and plain C.  C is actually not a bad language if you want to write fast code with relatively little effort and don&#x27;t care about reliability or security.  The value add of C++ over C is far from clear.  (I don&#x27;t know of any OS written in C++.  Linus wrote a famous rant about why Linux is written in C and not C++.  There are, however, examples of operating systems written in Lisp.)<p>> wouldn&#x27;t it be more productive to ask questions about why people use it?<p>I know why people use it: it&#x27;s fast, there is a huge installed base, and it&#x27;s an excellent platform for studly programmers to display their studliness.  That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that C++ has deep design flaws which result in its being incredibly hard to use and extend.  And the existence of coders studly enough to be productive in C++ does not change the fact that it imposes an extremely high cognitive load on its users.",1398059382

They come to our campus recruiting, have hired multiple students from the university I attend, I heard they&#x27;ve moved into a new expansive office this year and put in such a big effort. If all of this is going to waste despite the fact that Square is solving a real business problem (unlike so many many other startups), doing a startup seems like such a small possibility of success - its scary. As a college student, a lot of engineers tell me how much they learnt while working at a startup etc, but is it even worth it if legitimate problem-solving startups are failing like this?

Projects with a strong record of this include OpenBSD (which is now conducting a focused effort to clean up the OpenSSL code:  <a href=""http://opensslrampage.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensslrampage.org/</a>) and the Debian project (with formal social contract, constitution, and policy all of which put the interests of the end-user front and center).  While Debian&#x27;s had its security snafus, particularly relative to OpenBSD, among Linux distros it&#x27;s tended to be among the more secure and security-conscious distros, in my experience.<p>But projects with a long track record of disdain also tend to show themselves for want of strong security:  PHP, awstats, GNOME, and more recently, systemd, all come to mind.  I have grave concerns over the damage the latter is now in a position to do, and the fact that one dev has already been denied privileges to submit kernel patches by Linus Torvalds doesn&#x27;t do much to increase my confidence.",1398058937

There are no good property management companies in Cincinnati.  At least, there are no highly reviewed property management companies - only those with negative reviews or no reviews at all.<p>2. Owners looking to rent their homes might be a great demographic for this idea.  While most of the property management companies state that they do regular maintenance checkups, they really aren&#x27;t incentivized to do so and from the reviews I read they typically don&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re really only incentivized to keep the renter renting so that they continue to get their cut.  As it stands, owners and tenants are often at odds when it comes to &quot;needed&quot; repairs because the property management companies charge the owners $50/hour plus parts for any repairs beyond the most routine of maintenance.  Basically the property management companies have stuck themselves between a rock and a hard place where it&#x27;s almost impossible to make both the owner and tenant happy.  If, however, the owners were paying a larger monthly fee that covered all repairs, they&#x27;d no longer be at odds with the tenant.  Of course, the problem of &quot;tenant abuse&quot; would then fall on us.  Hopefully by being proactive with regular maintenance the abuse could be mitigated somewhat.<p>I&#x27;m going to call a few property management companies tomorrow to get a better idea of what exactly is and isn&#x27;t covered under their plans.",1398058381

As if we didn&#x27;t have enough uncertainty just by virtue of being a startup... :) Good planning, redundant communications channels, and relationships with multiple people on the ground at various distances (and therefore in multiple internet connectivity zones!) can mitigate this... to a point.<p>Something that startups like us do need to think about is resistance within artisans&#x27; communities. As the article mentions, &quot;men’s resistance was rooted in the fact that their control as resellers of the rugs would decline as the women learned how to do it on their own.&quot; Only regular on-the-ground presence can have a chance of detecting these scenarios and mediating them, and that&#x27;s tough for a startup to prioritize - but it often has to be done.<p>Finally, when the authors cite youth who avoid training for artisan skills because they fear that &quot;in the best-case scenario, you live a life as an organization’s beneficiary,&quot; this scenario is something that even the article&#x27;s success story needs to mitigate. While the successful Imelghaus cooperative is in many ways independent, it&#x27;s still the case that Imelghaus&#x27; revenue stream largely depends on the continued appeal of a foreign-operated brand, as well that brand&#x27;s continued commitment to Imelghaus even as they onboard other artisan collectives. This is especially true for artisan products being incorporated into the fashion industry, where seasonality and freshness of products is considered highly desirable (to say the least). Our team&#x27;s hypothesis is that at scale with multiple product lines incorporating different artisans&#x27; products, we can continue to drive sales to artisan groups that were highlighted in previous seasons, by promoting them in the same way any data-driven company would promote related products to new and existing customers; to put it mathematically, we&#x27;d add regressors for the success of our artisan partners into the optimization algorithm for recommendations, rather than recommending simply by user preferences alone, and leverage the strength of our brand to make this strategy viable. We&#x27;re still at the product development stage, so only time will tell if this bears out. But it&#x27;s an intriguing and fulfilling space to dive into!<p>(If you&#x27;re interested in discussing more, feel free to contact me in my profile!)",1398058228

Some percentage of people do it regularly.<p>However anecdotally I would suggest most people have not. Outside the US conditions for the road-trip holiday are not as prevalent. In high-density Europe for instance there are easier ways to travel (train for example). In Asia &quot;most&quot; people don&#x27;t own a car and driving for fun is almost unheard of.<p>The perfect conditions for a road-trip exist in large countries with lots of open spaces, good roads, good places to stay interesting places to get to and so on. USA, Australia, South Africa and so on.<p>A motoring holiday in the UK is brilliant, but the short distances would work fine with simple recharge points. It&#x27;s hard to drive for 4 days solid in the UK without just going around in circles.<p>Of course the idea of the road trip is more fun than the road trip itself, and we end up doing a trip maybe once every few years. I use my car every day to commute.<p>It&#x27;s the idea that I <i>could</i> do a road trip that seems to be the logic against electric, but in practice I don&#x27;t actually do one all that often. (some people do, but they&#x27;re a tiny minority)<p>Heres my point. Do the math. Simply hire a petrol car when you want to do a road-trip. For most people that will be never, for others it might be every few years - for a tiny fraction it will be often. The tiny fraction can continue to drive petrol. The price of oil isn&#x27;t coming down, so that will be more and more expensive.<p>On the up side every road-tripper should lobby for electric cars all day long. Using petrol for commuting is a terrible waste, and when it runs out its the road tripper who will be hurt.<p>Frankly electric cars today have more than enough range for daily use for 360+ days in the year. As the price of oil rises over the next 10 years the economics for electric make a lot more sense.",1398058080

It got into software because they wanted a way to sell the complete package to their customers (buy our sensors and this control panel, your building/bus/train/plane will be safer and you don&#x27;t have to write the control software yourself!). Before my time there they had 4 or 5 people in software. 1 coder. 1-2 testers. 1-2 QA. Their test suites were ludicrously incomplete. No one thought that this was odd, except for those of us in software who came to the show later. The higher ups considered software to just be a necessary inconvenience, it wasn&#x27;t until our shop started delaying deliveries (because it was understaffed, underpaid, and inexperienced) that they started hiring more people (all underpaid and inexperienced as well) in an effort to throw more bodies at the problem (seriously, see the F-35 for a repeat of this exact behavior).<p>Short version: Hardware organizations don&#x27;t get software.

They probably won&#x27;t get fixed even if you talk to the manufacturer about them; in fact you run the risk of the manufacturer convincing the police to raid your home, or of the manufacturer suing you.<p>Now try the same with open-source software.

Think of how many deals Mark Cuban can pass on just because he doesn&#x27;t like the terms, and how good he&#x27;s gotten good at negotiating favorable equity terms and knowing which deals are good/bad.  Someone that&#x27;s totally new is likely to be totally inept at some part of the business dance and will likely get rooked.

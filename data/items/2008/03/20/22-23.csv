142004,comment,141679,141679,0,0,fendale,,,"Unfortunately I work for a big company, and our team has a ridiculous 150+ designers/developers - how anything gets done is beyond me.<p>Also unfortunately, it fell upon me to review as much of the code produced as possible for some time.  It wasn't a horrible job, but it opened my eyes just how beginner some of these developers seemed, and to how useful code reviews can be.<p>I never attempted to organise tradition 'sit-down' reviews - it wouldn't have been a good use of peoples time (and 90% of the team are in india!) - I just checked out a particular module and scanned it for red flags, repeated code and attempted to build up an understanding of what it was supposed to do.<p>Doing that caught many design flaws and simplified many chunks of spaghetti code, not to mention abuse of the database (bad queries, unnecessary queries etc) etc, so I think it was a good use of time.<p>Catching design flaws at this post implementation review stage is not really productive however, as its too expensive to fix them.<p>My solution to that was to do white board sessions with the designers, then ask someone to write up the outcome in a couple of pages to be quickly reviewed by the other members at that meeting - doing that was essential, as the number of times miss-understandings were caught before a code editor was even opened was amazing!<p>So basically, I think that code reviews have their place, but my feeling is that a sit down meeting is generally overkill.  I also reckon that they are much more important (perhaps exponentially so) in a large team with many potential mediocre programmers than in a startup with several much more competent hackers!<p>I have never tried pair programming, but I know a lot of people are fans of it - I can see how it would be useful in a big corporation when someone is implementing someone else's vision, but struggle to see how it would work in a small startup.  In the startup, surely people would be trying things and molding the vision in ones head until something useful comes out?  I certainly hope to give it a try someday to see how it goes ...",1206053203

Doing that first step by yourself is fine. I had my lawyer do it and I found out that all they do is have a paralegal go to the website. However if you have more than one founder you'll want to go to an attorney and work up some sort of agreement among the founders. Right of first refusal to sell their share, what happens to a founder's shares if he prematurely meets his demise, what happens to a founder's shares if he gets divorced, etc. There are a whole bunch of these situations to consider and you need to get the answers in an agreement up front.",1206053142

141986,comment,141898,141898,0,0,jimbokun,,,"This made me think of something Peter Drucker wrote, and I think it came from the article summarized here:<p><a href=""http://knowledgeworks.wordpress.com/2007/06/05/article-the-coming-of-the-new-organization-peter-drucker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://knowledgeworks.wordpress.com/2007/06/05/article-the-c...</a><p>pg says that the modern firm is the product of modern technology, but this summary of Drucker's article points out that technology is also obviating the need for much of the ""middle management"" layers that pg criticizes as anathema to humankind's natural state.<p>I'm pretty sure somewhere Drucker also says that the only reason to keep activities within a single firm is because the transaction costs are lower than having activities performed by an outside firm.  I think he also argued that as transaction costs between firms fall due to technology, it makes sense to ""outsource"" more and more, which of course we are seeing in today's economy.  Which suggests that we should see more small firms over time.<p>Too bad Drucker is no longer with us.  I'm sure he would have a lot more interesting things to say relevant to startups.",1206051203

141984,comment,140831,140831,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've done this many times in the past, if on a more private scale (e.g. on the developer mailing list of a particular project).  In fact, a few years back, I started work on a website to facilitate this kind of project, though I never launched it (but I do still hold the ransomware.com domain name just in case I decide to come back to it).  All of those projects ranged in cost between $500 and $20000, and most eventually turned out good (though I sometimes had to double down and hand the code over to someone else, or work on it myself, to get it polished and ready for production).<p>In the Open Source world, this kind of thing is not at all rare or unproven.  It can work extremely well, and if it's something that works within an existing community of users and developers you get free quality control and vetting of the results...if it's a standalone project, I suspect you'll be doing your own QC.  Though I'm sure you wrangle some of your fellow YC'ers into helping bang on it if it's generally useful.<p>Firefox plugins are a good choice for this kind of model (and I had a Firefox plugin made for about $4k about three years ago, in a very similar process), as they are small, easily testable by a wide audience, and can leverage existing infrastructure for the hard stuff.<p>The tricky thing, however, which you've noted, is that since only one prize is being offered, you'll have a hard time getting real buy-in from a large number of developers.  $3k guaranteed is a great motivator for a student to spend a month working on something.  A 1-in-50 chance at $3k is far less of a motivator.  So, I've almost always broken it up into a ""prove you can and really want to do it"" phase and a ""OK, now do it"" (and the occasions where I didn't I already knew the work of the people offering to work on it from their Open Source contributions--this is tricky if you aren't following their projects reasonably closely).  I didn't always phrase it as a ""prove you can do it"" project...instead I would pick the highest value low effort part of the project and offer a pittance for the first person to solve it--$500 is plenty, if the task is small enough.  Then when the best version is delivered, I'd hire them for the rest of the project.<p>All of this begins to sound more like traditional contract work, rather than a contest, of course.  But it does work, and making it a public process does tend to get more community involvement than a ""I hired this guy to work on this project and now it's done, let me show you it"" situation--if you need to get the project merged into the core project codebase, this separatist practice can make the merger very difficult...personalities get bruised if they think you're absconding with good ideas and dropping in a bunch of code they've never seen or talked about.",1206051076

It’s worth noting that almost every large company strives to be “entrepreneurial”, although some are better at implementing this than others.

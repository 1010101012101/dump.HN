Any game that CAN be automated <i>deserves</i> to be.  <p>Instead of making a game that is interesting, they made a glorified Skinner box, because that's the proven formula to rake in the bucks via addiction.  Like rats pressing a lever to get a pellet, the game substitutes repetitive, mindless activites for actual plot or compelling narrative.<p>Then they cracked down on bots.  They install spyware on your machine called ""Warden"" and snoop what you're up to.  They even nailed people using macros, programmable keyboards, and the commercial version of Wine (to play on Linux).<p>It's relatively easy to automate various game activities, but it's hard to make a bot that can convincingly fake being a human, especially if an admin starts asking questions or if they CAPTCHA you in some way.<p>Thus they try to make sure an actual human is sitting there doing the mindless activities all day long.  This creates pressure to use the cheapest human labor possible to get these repetitive, mind-numbing tasks out of the way.<p>The sweatshop element could be eliminated by simply allowing scripting.  Of course that wouldn't fix the game's inherent design flaws -- UO, EQ, and WoW all suffer(ed) from the same ones.\n",1182134751

28778,comment,28640,28767,0,0,paul,,,"Yeah, and Google is just a box that you type stuff into. Just because someone can make an oversimplified explanation doesn't make it true. There's a lot more going on in these products than you realize. There's a reason why Facebook is winning and, for example, Orkut is not.",1182134397

Maybe you could create a tagline, and put it under your logo? That's such a standard that it's really intuitive and reassuring.<p>""PostMyDay.com -- Rant and rave about your day!""<p>Or whatever..<p>+ I think you could cut back on the ads a bit. They're distracting and it's not like you have traffic to monetize yet.<p>+ I love smallcaps font too, but I think you're overusing it.<p>+ Maybe you can reduce the registration page. Not ask for any information you don't absolutely need. Make it less work to signup.<p>+ Top left front page login box is rendering incorrectly for me. Password: is above input but Email: is to the left of input.<p>+ Your use of the color red is a bit alarming. I see red and I think error/problem. Maybe make that stuff orangered or otherwise more mild?<p>\n+ As for the concept I think the biggest weakness is: Why do I need this thing? Maybe I'd like to bitch about my day, but why would I want to do it on here?<p>+ Maybe you could ask ""What time do you get off?"" and send an email to users everyday before or after they leave work asking ""How was your day?"". Send a link to update their page or accept their response email as a post?<p><p>",1182133997

Clearly for the people who work at the Gold Farms it's the best paying thing they can find, else they would switch jobs.",1182133639
28774,comment,28703,28754,0,0,lupin_sansei,,,"Well said. If there was better work than Gold Farming they would do it.<p>I'm with Milton Friedman in thinking that Sweatshops are a good thing, in that they provide a job for people who've got no place else to work. Remove the sweatshops and they starve.",1182133483
28773,comment,28699,28736,0,0,npk,,,"I completely disagree.  They're targeting a specific market, though that market does not include you, there are a ton of people who want to have their music, and only their music, backed up.<p>You're also not really thinking about the big picture.  By focusing their product on iTunes, they can add crazy features, like library sync, or library ""move.""  I've helped my mom move her library to a new computer, this product would have been perfect to help her.<p>The good news is these guys already have a product, so they don't have to listen to bad negative feedback.",1182132511

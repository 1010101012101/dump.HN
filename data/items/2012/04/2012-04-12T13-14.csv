3832270,comment,3832069,3832200,4,0,fffggg,,,"How do you test that it isn't valid? I think you may be underestimating the difficulty in predicting whether a particular decimal number can be accurately represented as a floating point type. It may be non-obvious, but the representation of precise numbers changes depending on the number base.  For example, in base 10, we can't precisely represent 1/3. In base 3, we can (0.1). In base 2, we can't precisely represent 0.1, or 1/10. A simple number such as 0.1 has no precise representation in base 2.<p>In this case in php, the truncation happens due to loss of precision in the mantissa of the double precision float. But there are so many other ways to lose precision, I don't think it's reasonable to ask a language to attempt to account for them.<p>This is why languages should have clear rules about when type conversion occurs, and allow the user to prevent it when it isn't desirable.<p>edit: in fact, amusingly, php seems to be doing some non-standard stuff with its floats. I was going to make a point about how you can't determine if a double is a ""correct"" representation of a string decimal, but in mocking an example I discovered something odd. Check this out:<p>This is what one should expect:<p>$ ruby -e'puts ""%5.25f"" % 0.1'<p>0.1000000000000000055511151<p>$ perl -wle'printf ""%5.25f\n"", 0.1'<p>0.1000000000000000055511151<p>But in php:<p>$ php -r'printf(""%5.25f\n"", 0.1);'<p>0.1000000000000000000000000<p>$  php -r'printf(""%5.25f\n"", ""0.1"");'<p>0.1000000000000000000000000<p>Is php changing the type conversion?

You use meteor as a foundation to build your application as backbone is more or less your application itself. Think ""CoreFoundation"" vs ""AppKit"" kind of difference.<p>by jguimont",1334236295

But that's partly because I'm technical and willing/able to deal with formatting codes for things that should be rendered as more than text: html, restructured text, markdown, etc. In a sense it's a step backwards to WordPerfect and their split screen.<p>There's a lot to be said for wysiwyg. Most people are unwilling or unable to learn or use formatting code in plain text and no immediate rendering of the result.<p>But fundamentally there's no reason why anyone should <i>have to</i> deal with plain text source that produces nicely rendered output (unless we want to). Computers are really, really good at displaying things nicely, and hiding details.<p>The problem is that Word (and the creeping Sharepoint ecosystem) are much too powerful for almost everyone's needs. My work is typical: all our documents are a single font, and they have tables. The docs are kept in Sharepoint, and we do nothing with Sharepoint but keep documents.<p>That over-engineered solution would be better replaced with a very simple word processor like WordPad or some similar rtf tool, and the file system.<p>I don't need to use the truck that takes space shuttles from the vehicle assembly building to the launch pad just to get to work.",1334236252

However, as you say, if the preamble contradicts the terms, then it's harder (if not impossible?) to enforce the contradictions.<p>In the end, it'll be a specific case and a specific judge that causes the interpretation... and other things such as representations of the service and any correspondence between the parties may also be taken into account.<p>I'm not a Lawyer, This isn't Legal Advice.",1334235918

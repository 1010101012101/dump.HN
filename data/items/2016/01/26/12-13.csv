He asked what I was working on (evolutionary algorithms) we got talking about domains of knowledge.<p>He said all knowledge has a half-life, the time it takes for half of what you know to be redundant or wrong. Math, he said, is the longest, measured in centuries or millennia. One should feel sorry for neuroscientists: they can go to the bathroom and half their knowledge will be out of date.<p>The only time I spent with him, but both the metaphor and his passion for math will stay with me.",1453813110

Tons of people are having trouble with this, and the interaction with $GOPATH.<p>This course has fourth year undergrads and masters&#x27; students. Most are familiar with some languages but aren&#x27;t too used to production code practices (basically, one of the target audiences for Go -- be simple so that everyone can ramp up). Some have said that they preferred submodule deps or pythonesque easy-to-copy and easy-to-play-with import statements (and pip install) over this.<p>There is the valid argument to be made that any model for <i>publishing</i> your package is going to be tougher than a simple github URL, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be <i>much</i> worse. With Rust, for example, you need to run `cargo login` once (which will direct you to a page where you can make an account if you need to) to set up, and then `cargo publish`. Pretty easy to learn.<p>I like a lot of things about Go, including it&#x27;s simplicity. I wish I had more time to write Go, because it&#x27;s a fun language to work with.

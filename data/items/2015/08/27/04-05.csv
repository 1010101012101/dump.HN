10127626,comment,10124036,10127075,0,0,netfire,,,"Yeah, perhaps a better solution might be to have the federal or state government impose fines on local city governments for incidents where citizens&#x27; constitutional rights are infringed. I&#x27;m not as interested in personal compensation for the injury as I am making sure that cities and police can&#x27;t violate citizen&#x27;s rights without consequences that ensure that the activity isn&#x27;t repeated.<p>The fact that this city was collecting 61% of their annual revenue through regular police stops (many of which seem to be unconstitutional) is alarming. There has to be a better solution than to just appeal or sue for compensatory damages, which in most cases, will have little to no affect on the city. Even the $30K damages in this case seems small compared to the more than $1 million they collected in 2006 alone.<p>It seems like they should be subject to substantial fines, if not jail time for the officers or judges that are involved in these stops and cases. It just seems wrong that a city can arrest and jail someone for almost a month for not paying a $1,580 fine, but no one in the city government gets jail time for violating the constitutional rights of thousands of citizens, while making millions from their disregard of the law.",1440651473

10127569,comment,10125656,10127465,0,0,kentonv,,,"So, to start, note that Sandstorm is not primarily targeted at hosting web sites. It&#x27;s more of a replacement for Google Apps (especially Google Docs). Some of the apps (such as Ghost and Wordpress) can host web sites as a function of the app, but this is not really the main focus of the platform. Most Sandstorm apps are intended to be accessed through the Sandstorm shell interface.<p>> First, I&#x27;m still unclear on how urls work. For example, can I host a multiple wordpress blogs at multiple domains? Like jerrac.tld, foobar.tld, and example.org?<p>Yes, you can create multiple Wordpress instances and connect them to different domains. Note that publishing content to domains is something that only the Wordpress, Ghost, and Hacker CMS apps do currently.<p>Most apps are designed to be accessed embedded in the Sandstorm UI, where they get free authentication, authorization, document management, sharing, etc.<p>> What if I also want to have other apps on those domains?<p>You can always set up nginx in front.<p>> Also, how do I view a wordpress instance as an anonymous user? I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.<p>The dashboard contains instructions for publishing content to your domain. (Though you can&#x27;t actually do this under the demo -- you can only get a randomly-generated domain.)<p>> Second, how do multiple users work? For example, a user that has editor perms in wordpress and can create Lychee and Etherpad apps, but can&#x27;t do anything else.<p>You can invite users to your Sandstorm server.

Design can be indicative of a variety of important things, like a company&#x27;s commitment to its users/customers. Google&#x27;s simple search experience was a conscious design decision that helped it stand out and build a following early on. Although Facebook has changed considerably, when it first launched, it was a design inspiration compared to MySpace. For all the dismissing you do of design, it&#x27;s interesting that, at least with these two examples, you&#x27;ve picked companies that made very smart and very conscious design decisions early on, helping them rocket to the success stories they are today. For pioneering companies that are tackling hard engineering problems and bringing these breakthroughs to the public, I would agree that design might not be as important initially. This is one of the advantages of being first to market with something people want. You get to set the bar and you can get away with a lot of things (Although it&#x27;s not an example of breakthrough tech and more an example of a first mover advantage, Snapchat&#x27;s UX is horrible [it has improved!] but since they popularized disappearing content, users were willing to deal with a poor user experience.). As markets mature, as technology spreads, or as established players attempt to enter new markets (Google with Google+), it can be harder to stand out on engineering alone unless you continue to push boundaries and break new ground (Hangouts!), but even then, it might not be enough (Hangouts...). In other words, in scenarios where technology is getting commoditized, you could argue that design (how it looks and feels) can become even more important than engineering (how it&#x27;s built). Is the iPhone&#x27;s success due more to it&#x27;s revolutionary engineering or it&#x27;s thoughtful design?

10127525,comment,10120831,10123855,0,0,pron,,,"> In all western democracies that I&#x27;m aware of, the central bankers are meant to be independent of politicians.<p>What do you mean? They are <i>appointed</i> (and reappointed or not) by politicians.<p>> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s impossible, or that it&#x27;d never happen even if the users were collectively strongly in favour.<p>The difference is that in a state these things are done as part of bargains, which help prioritize. For example &quot;I&#x27;ll support your nomination for the chair of the central bank if you support my law allowing same-sex marriage&quot;. Sometimes these bargains can take the form of hostage-taking and be annoying, e.g. &quot;If you don&#x27;t repeal the ACA, I won&#x27;t vote to raise the debt ceiling&quot;, but that&#x27;s all part of the same process of keeping people in control. That bargaining, BTW, happens regardless of the political system (i.e. even in autocracies), only in a less explicit way and sometimes with different people involved.<p>Once you completely separate the power structure for the currency from other concerns, you lose that control, and you lose it in a very radical way. Thing is, it&#x27;s harder to bargain with people with money because they are relatively immune to many social effects. However, one of the classical checks-and-balances mechanisms in history is that of money and violence (and, at some point, religion). The two are both forms of power (i.e. ability to influence), but unlike money, violence is much harder to concentrate in the hands of the few (technology is changing that, but there are other, subtler sanctions at play that resist total concentration of violence). So the rich could starve the poor <i>and</i> had horses and swords, but they knew that if they went too far, they couldn&#x27;t withstand an uprising.<p>The state made an interesting deal: a central authority (though ideally not concentrated -- the two are different concepts) would have a monopoly over violence (up to a point), and, in exchange, it would regulate money. It wouldn&#x27;t let the poor kill the rich (again, up to a point), but, through regulation it would make sure that the rich don&#x27;t starve the poor. Once you separate the two, and, in the process, make even extreme violence less disruptive, you break a very important balance that has been reached. Like some sort of a MAD doctrine, you <i>want</i> to keep a mutual, implicit threat going.<p>Which brings me back to the first point about central bankers. Even after their appointment, and even if they&#x27;re not interested in another term, they still have a responsibility toward their community -- as I hinted at before, democracy only formalizes certain rules that have always implicitly had an effect, and certain sanctions are always at play even if not made formal by the democratic system.

You have to get really aggressive about communication, especially on a remote team. A lot of expectations can get lost. It&#x27;s possible to survive and thrive without a good on-boarding process, but you have to step up and assume that responsibility yourself.<p>This isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s thing, and often feels like straying into rude, invasive behavior -- and from the startup&#x27;s perspective, you lose a lot of great people too -- so asking this question will give the prospective hire an idea of whether they are getting set up for failure. Even an honest answer from the potential employer, &quot;We don&#x27;t have one, we are very busy and everything is really chaotic here&quot; will tell you a lot about expectations (for both parties) within the first couple weeks of starting work.<p>And obviously, if the potential employer gives some BS in lieu of a straight answer, why waste time joining?",1440648902

It isn&#x27;t all roses and sunshine for the employee, essentially you will be stuck working for them, and if you ever get fired you have to find a new employer very quickly or risk getting deported.<p>While the last part is true (about having to find a new employer quickly if you are fired or laid off), it&#x27;s not true that you are stuck with your sponsoring employer. H-1Bs are allowed to switch companies. The caveat is that if the previous employer had started the Green Card process, it is reset with the new employer, unless the employee is at the last stage of the process (adjustment of status) and has been in that stage for at least 180 days.<p>> Even if you do keep your job it is extremely difficult to convert it to residence (I believe that requires costly employee sponsorship too).<p>All of the big tech companies apply for Green Cards for their foreign employees. Some have a requirement that you work for them for some amount of time (I&#x27;ve never heard of more than 1 year), others will start the process as soon as you join.<p>However, there&#x27;s one BIG gotcha for someone coming from India: they will have to wait for a really long time to get their Green Cards. I&#x27;m talking about 10+ years here. For China it&#x27;s bad too but no so bad. For the rest of the world it used to be 3-5 years (for EB-3, EB-2s have had it quick for years), but recently they sped it up a lot.

You can kinda make the case for Windows being three different OSes, but the Win3.1/Win95 tree has been dead for over a decade, and Windows CE was never really positioned as being compatible with other Windows anyway.<p>And it&#x27;s not like Linux doesn&#x27;t come in versions, and it&#x27;s not like a change in versions doesn&#x27;t have similar compatibility concerns as it does in Windows. (Honestly, I think it&#x27;s worse on Linux -- it is a lot easier to run the same version of, say, MySQL on consecutive releases of Windows than it is on RHEL/CentOS.)<p>So post-XP, where Windows NT ate DOS-based Windows, you have Windows progressing version to version -- Vista, 7, 8, 10. You can see the same progression in Linux OSes -- Debian goes Etch, Lenny, Squeeze, Wheezy, Jessie over a similar timeframe. But at the same time, Fedora runs from version 6 around Vista&#x27;s launch to version 23 due out in a few months from now. So, like Windows, you have a concern with making an application run on both, say, Squeeze and Wheezy. But you also have an additional problem where you need to make it work on Beefy Miracle. For most software Linux users come into contact with, developers will write software for one, maybe two distros or so, and each distro ports the software over, essentially. So every open-source project is essentially forked by each distro. It&#x27;s not a model conducive to closed-source software. Which... there are plenty of people who are openly happy about this, as they would rather encourage open-source software over closed source, so it&#x27;s not like this is strictly an accident or a mistake.

Obviously, such a system is not available (yet), and these inferior systems are needed in order to make progress, and get there...eventually..but sometimes I wonder if the focus is on the right outcome, or just the broad strokes cookie cutter solution that comes to mind first (restaurant reservations). Similar to how all JavaScript MVC frameworks demo a to-do app, and rails tutorials demo&#x27;d a blog (initially)...<p>I mean, seriously... How often do you not go out to eat because you are too lazy or busy to make a reservation? Now, how many times do you skip oil changes, or making calls to cancel your cable service, because you don&#x27;t want to make time in your day to stop what you&#x27;re doing, pick up the phone, and call?",1440648129

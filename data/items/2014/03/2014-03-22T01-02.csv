But, the echo-chamber problem might have gotten worse lately, since some key people have fled the site.<p>It&#x27;s tough to draw many conclusions from reactions to just a few comments. There are too many variables: tone, time of day, subject matter, who happens to be browsing the site at that time. And people can suffer from argument fatigue, even if it&#x27;s a totally civil debate.<p>So I&#x27;m not yet convinced that this will be a huge problem for contrary opinions, and if such a problem already exists, this change might even fix it a little by removing some of the noise that&#x27;s distracting people from better comments.",1395453577

I think if you re-do these numbers that will appear a lot more affordable.<p>Proponents of BI say it can&#x27;t exclude anyone. That is silly. Things we consider the most basic fundamental rights: voting, free speech, are restricted for large groups such as convicted felons. It would be reasonable that anyone who fails to conform with government rules of accepted social behavior should also be excluded from BI.<p>The more serious problem with BI is how the dollars flow toward prices. If you make a blanket distribution of money to a large group of money the end result may just be price inflation in the goods that exist in a limited quantity, most specifically real estate.<p>I think BI is a fairly poor idea. But, being realistic I am trying to imagine what it would look like in use. All I see is a tool for governments to control large segments of lower middle class citizens.

I&#x27;m arguing that giving money to poor people so they don&#x27;t attack me is theft. buzaga was saying that if I/we don&#x27;t &quot;take care of the unfortunate&quot;, they&#x27;ll decide to take our money/stuff by force. Sounds like a veiled threat to &quot;give them money, or else...&quot; That is theft, in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m perfectly fine with taxes as long as they go to things that benefit everyone equally, including me (like roads, schools, police and courthouses).<p>EDIT: Also, please point out where I said (or implied) that &quot;taxes are theft&quot;.

(Note that many of these existing programs are currently joint federal/state funded programs, so unless BI was done the same way, this would also involve shifting some spending from the states to the federal government.)<p>(2) The full single-person household federal poverty line is a very high target to aim for per person for BI in an initial implementation. Half of the two-person household FPL  per adult citizen and permanent resident (about $7500/each), and, if BI is going to paid to children (or, rather, guardians on their behalf) the full marginal amount for an additional family member (about $4000/each) per child (again citizens and permanent residents) is probably a more reasonable target to aim for, but I&#x27;d expect an initial implementation to start out below that and work up.",1395453289

What happened to the business approach?<p>The US government is delivering a large number of products with wildly varying costs, efficiencies, and price points.  e.g. unemployment, welfare, food stamps, etc. There is a proposal is to replace those products with only one.<p>The new product fills (mostly) the same need as the existing ones.  It will do so at less cost, with more efficiency (less bureaucracy, administration, fraud, etc.).  Previous market studies show that it works.<p>So... what&#x27;s the problem?<p>As a non-US person, this looks a lot like previous discussions on health care.  France pays about $10 per person per day for universal health care.  The UK pays about $10.  Japan pays about $10.  Canada pays about $10.<p>The US (before Obomacare) ?  About $20, for care that isn&#x27;t universal.<p>You guys are getting ripped off.  Yet the bulk of the population sticks their fingers in their ears, and complains about people who may not &quot;deserve&quot; it.  Or they complain about fraud.<p>Who the hell cares about random welfare guy ripping off the system?  If you&#x27;re making over $40K per year, you&#x27;re getting ripped of by the system.  By <i>your</i> system, that you demand to keep in place.<p>You can get rid of the checks and balances, and just absorb the cost of fraud.  And as a bonus, a simpler system is harder to game, which leads to more detectable fraud, and therefore less of it.<p>This won&#x27;t happen in the US for a number of reasons.  One of which is that the bureaucracy won&#x27;t voluntarily reduce.  Another (as seen here) an unwillingness to deal with these issues in a business-like manner.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m from a socialist country advocating for <i>more</i> capitalism.

I decided against it due to it being barely more than an intramural sport at the collegiate level and the huge time commitment. Then my bowling ball and shoes were stolen out of my car and I never bothered replacing them. Now I bowl 120-160 ish with house balls. Every lane has uv and laser light and bowling is not really that fun anymore. In the 90s I went to an old school smoke riddled over head projector scoring lane and now it&#x27;s a kids laser show.

I almost think there should be a pending &quot;downvote&quot; to limit the number of times that people are reviewing a specific pending comment, so that if it is trash it dies and gets out of the way of newer pending comments worth reviewing, or maybe something where there are subgroups of pending comments so that you don&#x27;t somehow languish in a low priority queue if no one looks at it, but instead get a chance at someone looking at it.<p>The 24 hour rule also is a bit sad because as far as I can tell, HN dies down a lot during the weekend, and some interesting articles come out that dont receive the attention they deserve.

So the first thing I&#x27;d do is try to figure out how the interview system for any given prospective employer works.<p>Some places just ask relatively formulaic questions that you can just prepare for with a couple of web searches. Visit a random page for &#x27;technologyX interview questions&#x27;, and you&#x27;ll cover that kind of technical screening. That said, I personally consider that an employer that resorts to that kind of interview is probably not really all that good at hiring, and a company that isn&#x27;t good at hiring is rarely a company worth working for.<p>Another common kind of technical interview will, instead of going through random technology questions, follow a similar pattern but with more &#x27;book questions&#x27; than practical questions. Algorithms and all that. While this kind of interview is harder to game than the first, it&#x27;s still IMO relatively low quality, because it has to either be very basic, or rely on information that, if actually needed on the job, you could just figure out by going to a reference. It&#x27;s not as if there&#x27;s that much to gain by having employees that have memorized The Art Of Programming. What I really want, algorithms-wise, is someone that can research an algorithm, or choose one from some alternatives. I do not care if you do not know how to build an optimal quadtree to calculate collisions in 2d space: What is valuable is that if I tell you that you should calculate said collisions, you can actually find an algorithm that works, and could explain it if asked.<p>So all in all, that kind of technical interview if often a crapshoot, as you can never know exactly which kinds of algorithms the interviewer will be interested on that day. Which is why the best you can do to prepare for that kind of interview is to just figure out what specific kind of questions are going to be asked.<p>And finally, there&#x27;s my favorite kind of technical interview: Actual live coding, either from a well defined problem statement, or by working on an existing codebase, which one hopes has been handed to you a little bit in advance. This approach is straight out of Peopleware: You&#x27;d not hire a juggler if you&#x27;ve not seen him juggle, right?<p>So, in short. depending on the interview type, either try one of the many random sites on the internet that dole out technical questions, read some basic algorithms book, or if handed a codebase, study the heck out of it.",1395452866

SHA3 is actually not at all mainstream (very few applications use it), but (a) that will change over time and (b) nobody will really bat an eyelid if you choose to use it.<p>What Zooko is advocating for is a third mainstream option: BLAKE2.

Not going to the doctor is not an option: the physiology of a poor person is the same as that of a rich person. The treatment therefore is the same. Thus what you are proposing is basically legalizing leaving the poor behind. That was in fact how things used to work up until roughly 35-40 years ago. We then decided that it was a bad idea because the quality of care for those who had the &quot;budget&quot; care was so terrible that we would all be willing to pay more and not risk ending up in their shoes.<p>Look, I don&#x27;t disagree with everything you are saying. We need to reign in spending, streamline the government, reduce the size of the military, fund more social programs and education. I do disagree with the tiered approach. Healthcare is a basic human necessity. Lots of first world governments provide it and do it better and cheap than the &quot;free market&quot; in the US.

Women can do things, too.\nI want a career.&quot;.  I believed her.  I was \nnaive.<p>Her mother was pushing her\nhard away from motherhood and into something\nchallenging.<p>Although I didn&#x27;t yet see the role of her\nmother, I had good reasons to believe in her:\nSo, she was Valedictorian, PBK,\nWoodrow Wilson, &#x27;Summa Cum Laude&#x27;, Ph.D.  And\nin many ways, in academics and also daily\nlife, she was just hands down, flatly brilliant.\nShe had the endurance of an ultra athlete and\ncould go with so little sleep that so little for\nme would have me asleep standing up, literally.<p>Still, by the time she finished her Ph.D., she\nwas in a clinical depression from the stress,\nnever recovered, and died.  Her sisters had\nsimilar struggles.  It&#x27;s tough to separate\nnature and nurture here:  She got the nurture\nfrom her mother who had the nature but also\ngot the nature from her mother.  She likely got\nanother dose of the nature from her father, a\nguy who for some years worked 20 hours a day\nexcept cut back to 10 on Sundays.<p>Solid evidence is that such\nvulnerability to stress is four times more likely\nfor women than men.<p>There is a good reason for the expression &quot;Nervous\nNellie&quot; because, from an expert, &quot;women are much\nmore emotional than men&quot; and one way they are more\nemotional is that they are more nervous, more\neasily made afraid.  Such nervousness and fear\nleads to stress leads to depression, clinical\ndepression, serious problems, and sometimes death.<p>For a women in a challenging situation, have to\nexercise special care watching for signs of\nlow self-esteem, stress, &#x27;burn out&#x27;, and depression.  Some\nwomen can meet such challenges; too many can&#x27;t; even some\nthat very much look like they can, can&#x27;t;\nthese problems are much more likely for women;\nit&#x27;s a very challenging situation.<p>My advice I repeat:  Be careful.  Be very careful.<p>Some people just flatly want to believe that\n&quot;Women don&#x27;t have to just be cared for.\nWomen can do things, too.&quot; and want to and, then,\ndo hate any suggestion of anything else\nand pass off any suggestion as some sexism.\nNo, the caution\nI urge is based on hard experience.  Be careful.\nI didn&#x27;t say stop; I just said be careful.<p>&quot;Careful&quot;?  Yes, for a women, have to watch\nfor symptoms and problems that mostly would not\nhave to watch for for men.<p>Be careful.<p>Sorry about your dream, largely unfounded, that\nwomen are just the same in startups as men\nand have just been held down and now need to\nbe &#x27;unleashed&#x27;.  It&#x27;s not just a dream,\ntoo easily it&#x27;s a nightmare.  Sorry about your\ndream.  But if the woman is your sister, wife,\nor daughter, your dream can become a nightmare\nfor you.  You&#x27;ve been warned.  Let the pop media\nhave their fun pushing &#x27;lean in&#x27;, etc., but for\nyour sister, wife, and daughter, be careful,\nbe very careful.<p>If you want an explanation, then notice that\nDarwin&#x27;s forces were there and having their\neffects for many tens of thousands of years\nbefore startups. and we don&#x27;t know just what\nthose forces were or just how they worked.\nSince we can&#x27;t understand what those forces\nwere, for making big changes now we are\nwalking out on thin ice.  Be careful.<p>Or, the world of work, and startups were created\nby men in ways convenient for men.  And we should\njust assume that women will be comfortable in that\nworld?  Why assume?  Or how many men would be\ncomfortable in and fit in at\na baby shower?  How many men can do well at\ngossip?  For &#x27;social connections&#x27;, men don&#x27;t \ngossip; instead they communicate\ninformation (D. Tannen,&#x27;You Just Don&#x27;t Understand: Men and Women in Conversation&#x27;), and \nwomen communicate feelings and the rest of gossip.\nMen are from Mars, women from Venus, that is, \nthey are so different they seem to be from different\nplanets.

The cost of survival is getting cheaper and cheaper at an exponential rate.  You wouldn&#x27;t know that though because they keep raising the bar on what it means to &quot;survive&quot;—big screen tv, air conditioning, car, etc.  The amount of work required to live according to living standards 100 years ago is rather minimal.<p>3) Where does this &quot;basic income&quot; come from?  If you are taking it from others who produce value then how are you any better than a slave owner?  The only difference is that instead of owning and taking the livelihood of an individual you are taking it from everyone collectively in smaller amounts.  The moral principle is the same.<p>4) Why would people work if they can just take from others?  Everyone will do the least amount possible because everyone else is just going to take their profits so why bother.  Communism didn&#x27;t work so why are you proposing it now?<p>5) You can&#x27;t protect people from being stupid.

If it actually took around 7 seconds to shuffle about 20 megabytes[1] of data around, no one would use PHP for anything. Of course, the algorithm actually performs 20 million string concatenations, because of the way random strings are generated.<p>To give you an idea of how slow that is, maximum memory throughput with memcpy on many modern systems is measured in the tens of gigabytes per second. The comparison to .NET at the end is amusing, because the same benchmark including the random generation of characters can be done many times faster in C#. And I&#x27;m not even good at writing C#, having spent most of my time in Haskell. But I did it anyway.<p><pre><code>    PHP version (in C#)         = 1.8660s\n\n    Using prebuilt array        = 0.0654s\n\n    Using StringBuilder, random = 1.5628s\n\n    Using StringBuilder, array  = 0.0749s\n</code></pre>\nEDIT: If I construct the StringBuilder with a size parameter, it shaves another 0.02 seconds off (or 25% of execution time).<p>Gist for source: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/AaronFriel/9699764"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/AaronFriel/9699764</a><p>The original should be rewritten to not be a test of PRNG throughput. In the amount of time that it took PHP to generate those random strings, my unoptimized, first-try C# concatenates about a hundred times faster.<p>[1]I am aware that this is merely the size of the resultant string - 20 characters times 1,000,000 iterations. But it&#x27;s within a factor of two of the total bytes copied, and I don&#x27;t know PHP&#x27;s internal string representation.

For example:<p>(1) Measure the distribution of comment endorsement for >1000 HN users: how many they endorse, how often they endorse, and how that varies with things like hour of the day, time logged on, etc.<p>(2) Measure the distribution of &quot;time to endorse&quot; for comments (how long it takes from posting to endorsement), and how <i>that</i> varies with things like hour of the day, etc.<p>(3) Measure how many comments get lost in limbo because they are never endorsed.<p>My initial sense is that this is going to significantly raise the cost of participating in HN, which will make me less likely to participate.

There has been a downwards trend most probably due to the increasing popularity of HN.  A response is warranted. However, this system has the potential to silence a lot of high quality comments on any threads that aren&#x27;t on the front-page for an extended period of time.  Thus, you get a feedback loop.  Good posts require quality discussion to stay on top, but must stay on top to get quality discussion going with this added approval lag.<p>I think you should ease these changes in as conservatively and gradually as possible.  For example, apply it only to the top page at first, and reduce the number of endorsements required for display to 1. You might also consider merely greying out comments that have not yet been endorsed, as currently happens to down-voted comments. Another option would be to apply the endorsement system only after threads have reached a certain age so as to jump-start discussions.  Additionally, I would recommend that authors of a parent post should be able to see all child posts regardless of their karma.  Below, Babuskov raised the point that the endorsement system will obstruct useful back-and-forth discussions between sub-kilokarma users in buried threads that often takes the place of a private messaging system on HN.  This would fix that more effectively than merely reducing the endorsement requirement.<p>You should not entertain any illusions that you can flip the switch and watch this system work perfectly, and that you will therefore be able to avoid confusing people with many changes over a lengthy period of time.  Tweaking will almost certainly be required.",1395450954

It could do a lot of keep those shorter, more insightful, and more on-topic.<p>On the other hand, what about the smaller threads, that tend to get one or two dozen comments, if that, and probably not many page views? Would discussion there become essentially impossible unless a >1k-er deigns to drop in and bless a few of the posts with some endorsements? Has anybody actually checked what proportion of users are >1k and how willing they are to drop in on every thread on the site and endorse comments? Or constantly reload bigger threads and scroll all around to see new comments for that matter?<p>If it were up to me, I&#x27;d do a sliding scale. Something like no endorsement/auto-endorse all for under 20 total comments in the thread. At >50 comments in the thread, users with under, say, 100 karma need endorsement. At >100, you need maybe 250 karma, 200 posts 500 karma, etc. Maybe users under 5 or 10 karma always need endorsement. Maybe some formula to compute it that you can tweak the factors on as needed if there is too little discussion or too much fluff.<p>Another point - say I make a comment that sucks. Oops, happens to all of us sometimes. What happens then? Does it stay unendorsed and stuck forever? Can I just delete it, or will it auto-delete or something? Does it get downvoted without ever being endorsed?<p>Hey wait a second, I think we&#x27;re just getting closer to slashcode here...",1395450913

That&#x27;s the opposite of what I want to be doing.<p>Starting around the same time comment scores were hidden, people have been voting less on comments, and it often seems like few people even read your comments in threads not on the front page. What this effectively means, especially in less active threads, is that I can only hold conversations with people if they have >1000 karma. Others will simply fade into the ether.<p>A slightly less bad approach would be if the popularity of the thread determines the threshold for posts needing endorsement. So as an example, non-front-page threads get posts from people with >50% endorsement rate and >20 endorsements immediately live, threads on the bottom half of the front page get posts from people with a >75% endorsement rate and >50 endorsements immediately live, and threads in the top half of the front page have everyone go through endorsement. Or maybe the number of posts already in the thread determines those thresholds. The issue with that is that in a thread with 200 comments, I&#x27;m never going to look at all of them, or even a quarter, so any that need endorsement will likely be missed.<p>Another possibly less bad approach would be to start posts at 0 points if the poster is under a relatively high karma threshold.<p>Also, after 24 hours, all &quot;non-endorsed&quot; posts should go live with an indicator, not disappear, so we can see if the system is even working as intended, and have one last chance of finding those hidden gems.<p>That said, you will be missed, Paul! I hope we&#x27;ll still see you post from time to time.",1395450623

Those are pretty much essential at this point and the $10k will not even begin to cover insurance premiums for the elderly.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget that a huge number of the people work for the federal government and the budget you are citing includes their salaries. For a large percentage of the population, your proposal would mean poverty.<p>Simple math like this does not work on a system as complex as this.

If you failed to notice that your system would result in many users being arbitrarily and permanently banned, what else have you missed that no one else has pointed out yet?<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t read a &quot;pending comments&quot; page, because I come to HN to read and discuss stories that interest me, not to browse piles of random, context-free comments. I suspect that most users will feel the same, so it won&#x27;t help much.<p>This entire thing is a bad idea, and the current state of Hacker News comments is nowhere near bad enough to warrant such drastic measures.",1395450086

This is what Dropbox Support originally told me when I contacted them about the problem:<p>>  Thanks for writing in. It looks like the issue here is that our content servers (dl.dropbox.com) don&#x27;t currently allow arbitrary cross domain access in JavaScript. (This doesn&#x27;t apply to accessing the file directly in your browser, or downloading to your server locally, which is generally what one would do with the link returned by Chooser.)

C# is a good demonstration of the principle and I&#x27;m sure Java could support something similar. In the case of C#, forward declarations are unnecessary, and if you want/need to see something like a .h file then one can be generated automatically from the metadata included in the binary.<p>In fact Objective-C already includes pretty much everything necessary in the binary already, as you can see by using class-dump. Perhaps additional work would be required to support exposing absolutely everything that might be required, but there&#x27;s no obvious reason why the language couldn&#x27;t be extended to allow direct use of compiled code, with no need for a .h file.",1395450014

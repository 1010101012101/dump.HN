If I were the owner of the site, I would use a Link Ad just below the The Online Slang Dictionary with the same background color and white text color.<p>And I would add another Link Ad below Welcome to The Online Slang Dictionary this time with a white background.<p>Then I would remove the big vertical ad and place it in a box similar to the ""Subscribe to updates"" and ""Bookmark or share"" boxes and label it with maybe ""Other Resources"" -- after all Google text ads are relevant :P<p>Just my own 2 cents... :)",1239947376

Anti-virus software which is a complicated, unpredictable mechanism that significantly impedes the computing experience.<p>I find a more viable approach is to be careful with the OS install (not install untrusted stuff) and also to make it expendable. Data lives on a single-purpose unix host and is regularly backed up so I can do a predictable, quick, low-effort reinstall and be back to operation in a couple of hours.<p>An outcome I've wanted but not done - computer lives behind a router which is set up to make active monitoring and managing of traffic easy. Product idea - consumer-ready but geek-friendly router with powerful but easy-to-use tools that doesn't suck. Interface should be live so that you can see the traffic coming and going, and there should be controls to allow you to open up and close access to different sites. Stand-along system with a profile a bit like a sunray, plug for commodity keyboard and monitor.",1239946709
566439,comment,566190,566190,0,0,whacked_new,,,"This doesn't seem to evidence that bilingualism is a critical factor in faster/earlier development of executive functions. Language just happens to be a very suitable vehicle for it -- because babies desperately try to synthesize the information around them, they have no choice but to attune to the sounds and try to make sense of them.<p>It is possible that language is <i>the</i> most suitable vehicle, but it remains a vehicle and not the principle component. You could possibly get the same outcome, if for every interaction with the baby, the father and the mother have habitually different behaviors. Dad always uses his left hand, mom always uses right. Dad always wears blue, mom always wears red. This is has similar executive control / perspective taking demands. Language is just a more flexible and ubiquitous version of this kind of categorical differentiation.",1239946688
566438,comment,566365,566365,0,0,grandalf,,,"Creativity is the process of getting your brain not to shut down ideas that it comes up with before you can really give them a chance.<p>One way to do this is to focus on asking questions:<p>- What if this is the wrong approach?
- How can this be made more general?
- Should it be more general?
- Should I be doing the opposite?
- What other uses might this have?
- What problem is this a better solution to?
- What are the pieces of this idea?
  - What can I make with each piece?
  - (Repeat first steps)
- How can I implement this idea?
  - On a budget?
  - With an unlimited budget?
  - ""Green""
  - For Red staters
  - For blue staters
  - For the third world?
  - For free?
- Why not do this before now?
- Why not do this after now?<p>You get the idea.  Just let your questioner run wild and enjoy the process.  I recommend asking about 1000 questions and figuring out what makes you most excited or what you think packs the most punch.<p>I think creativity is more of the absence of a trait (excessive internal ""downmodding"" of thoughts) vs the presence of a trait.<p>Oh, and this may be a bit cliche, but sleep on it.  Doze off thinking about it and then maybe in the shower the next day you'll get some ideas.<p>Also brainstorming with a friend can be a fun way to flush out cool ideas.",1239946668

566435,comment,566365,566365,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I'm with the camp that it's hard to teach. I'm talking about ""creative"" in the romantic sense of the word: the kind that is stereotypically exhibited by mad scientists, hermit authors, and bipolar playwrights. The kind of ""useful abnormality"" that does not occur to the common mind.<p>In these cases, I would argue the creativity stems from a different brain structure, and I would not be wrong in saying so. To this extent, it cannot be taught. But in the same vein, everybody is creative in their own ways. But it needs to be coaxed. The coaxing is the job of the perceptive teacher, and I think the early years of life are critical for healthy development in this area.<p>How do you learn to be creative? I would sum it up as ""de-inhibit your brain."" If you grew up in an oppressive environment where you could be punished for any arbitrarily bad expression, it is imaginable that you would be conditioned to avoid thinking in certain non-standard ways.",1239946269

566428,comment,566086,566195,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I worked as a reviewer, games and movies, for a few years and my personal opinion is that the quality of good games has remained the same, the problem is that there are so many games being released that for the average person it is very difficult to tell what is good and bad.<p>I got out of reviewing when I felt there was too much pressure to rate certain companies high. I got to play some genuinely great games, but some were flat out awful to the point that it was painful to play. When I felt like I couldn't tell people not to buy certain games (hello EA) and when it got to the point that review material was being embargoed to give certain companies the advantage (I presume for giving high reviews) I couldn't take it anymore.<p>I believe it may take major layoffs and some companies going bust before we see some improvement. I doubt it would get as bad as the '83 crash, but then perhaps it should. This does seem to cycle in that so many games come out and then companies start trying to sell the chaff as grain and people stop buying.<p>Like you said, this happens in the movie industry. No movie has hit quite as high as Titanic, however the fan following for Star Trek could help it along, not to mention that I know a lot of people (including my wife) want to go see this despite my doubting they'd ever want to go see it. My wife can be particularly annoying to convince to watch a DVD or TV series, so the fact that she actually told me she wants to go see it (seconds after the trailer finishing in the cinema) gives me the impression it could do huge. My wife is literally a fan waiting to happen, so if Abrams can pull it off I might have a free ride for the rest of the franchise's life. Then there's just Stargate left to get her fully converted on and I'll have the three Stars (Wars, Trek and -gate).<p>I would find it quite ironic if the release of Star Trek saved the economy by getting sales well beyond the $2 billion mark.",1239945921

I blog because I greatly enjoy writing and I greatly enjoy explaining my ideas to others.<p>It sounds clich√©d perhaps, but you should write because you enjoy writing, not because you want to achieve all the secondary stuff that comes after you've written stuff for a long time and finally accumulated all those bells and whistles.<p>Daniel",1209977824

Now I'm trying to pass a variable in the URL and retrieve it. This is simple in PHP, and in Python I would think it would just be a dictionary.<p>The official documentation from mod_python is virtually useless. Even a list of classes and functions and how they work would be great.",1209977772

Firing for cause/without cause? Is there a vesting schedule?<p>These questions will take quite a few long and awkward discussions but it is a lot better to have it now rather than later. Really-really. Start early.<p>Second, find your local startup community and ask for references for a good, inexpensive incorporation lawyer. Pick one with best references and take the outcome of previous step to him/her. Make sure to read and understand everything (especially the deadlines) before you sign anything.<p>Small Business Development Centers could be a source of cheap advice, cheaper than asking same questions from a lawyer.",1209976548

Autocorrect is fine and dandy (and often wrong, but that&#x27;s another story). But most autocorrect systems limit themselves to spelling and grammar. Hemingway selects for readability.

However we are talking about their own stuff, their own products, their own servers and I expect them to be upfront about it (e.g. hey, we are using your data for ads targeting) and to fix vulnerabilities that may allow third-parties to access my data ilegaly or to harm me.<p>With NSA we are talking about something different. If the NSA can engage in subverting encryption standards, there&#x27;s no end to what they can do. If they ask Google to plant a backdoor in the Chrome binary, or Microsoft to plant a backdoor in Windows, or Apple to plant a backdoor in iOS/OS X, thus removing Google/Microsoft/Apple in the connection between me and them - I&#x27;ll never find out about it and my software will be defective &quot;by design&quot; and as I&#x27;ve said, my personal fear is not the NSA, but rather organizations that are closer to home. For example, if backdoors in the software that I use exist, then they can be discovered by organized crime syndicates that say, are in the business of stealing credit cards, or whatever.<p>Can Google/Microsoft/Apple/Yahoo promise to do the right thing with such possible exploits? Can they promise to fix them, as they are discovered? Of course not. Hence, I cannot trust them anymore, because it is not in them that I have to trust.<p>> <i>The problem is that these demands are possible to fulfil in the first place.</i><p>Well, shit happens all the time, mail accounts get hacked and so on. To me the real problem is that the software that I use may be defective by design and I cannot trust these providers to fix it or to tell me about it. Voting with my wallet also doesn&#x27;t work anymore, as long as the alternative is still a US-based company and in this regard I now feel that all US-based companies are equal. Yahoo even tried fighting warrantless spying and failed and we found out about it only because of Snowden&#x27;s leaks. So even if they <i>want</i> to do the right thing, they can&#x27;t.",1392216972

Tracking a running service doesn&#x27;t require being init. Any process can do it.<p>&quot;sysv init can not do this.&quot;<p>Nor should it. Services running <i>under</i> sysV init can, however.<p>&quot;More importantly, since there&#x27;s no ordering or dependency control&quot;<p>Yes, there is -- it&#x27;s implemented by the rc system. It&#x27;s crude, but it&#x27;s also just a bunch of shell scripts and completely pluggable. The systemd logic could trivially be inserted here either in place of /etc/rc, or by something that sits directly under init and drives the rest of the process.<p>&quot;In practice, while Daemontools for example is well written and as stable as it can be, by virtue of running outside pid 1 it is not immune to the effects of the surrounding system. It can, and does, end up orphaning monitored processes in a variety of circumstances&quot;<p>Any process can daemonize away from a process manager. systemd adds cgroups for tagging or containing process trees -- this is possible under runit/daemontools and it would only take minor changes to the supervise process to instantiate the cgroup and supervise accordingly.<p>To be clear: Any process can add cgroup support to track forked children. Solving this problem by adding cgroup support has absolutely nothing to do with becoming init.<p>&quot;By running as pid 1, systemd is protected against being killed.&quot;<p>No, that is false. There is no such protection -- killing pid 1 is easy. Rather, by running as pid 1 systemd will cause a kernel panic and bring down everything with it.<p>&quot;By then applying cgroups it can precisely track whether or not what was spawned is still running, even if it forks more stuff. By applying this to the boot process, it can provide this functionality to everything that gets started during boot.&quot;<p>sysV already exports most boot ordering into subprocess. It is trivial to achieve these tasks with systemd as a child of init.<p>&quot;This is functionality that init does not provide, and none of the process-monitors running outside of pid 1 can provide.&quot;<p>It is true that init doesn&#x27;t provide these features, nor should it.

Cutting 3% is hardly a rebalancing.

It is ridiculous how much more expensive a similar Mercedes Benz or a BMW is, compared to the USA. What they do is buy cars that have a couple of thousand miles on them and are ~6 months old. This makes them &quot;second hand&quot; and not new so they fall under different legislation. The cars are shipped inside containers on ships and even after all taxes are paid they still cost much less than the same car (similar mileage and age) bought from here. \nThe only problem these companies face is legalizing the cars in Europe - e.g. blinkers here must be yellow. However, this is also relatively easy to fix by buying the needed parts here and installing them on the cars before registration.<p>The car manufacturers need to understand that we live in a global economy and what they experience now is something that film distributors already went through more than 10 years ago with DVD region codes.

Because it is peer to peer and because the client can download from multiple seeds at the same time, Bittorent makes it easy to saturate my download bandwidth.<p>From a publisher&#x27;s perspective for legal torrents (e.g. think of Ubuntu.com) it&#x27;s better to distribute a torrent link on your website, than it is to provide a direct download link or to upload your stuff on Kazza, or Napster, or Dropbox, or Megaupload, or whatever. Notice how bandwidth and finding a host for popular stuff is a problem, being the reason for why people still use SourceForge.<p>I cannot agree with you - people don&#x27;t switch because of government-related actions. People switch when the alternative is superior. Let me give you another success story waiting to happen - Bittorent Sync makes it easy to synchronize stuff in your network. It&#x27;s still rough, but if I were Dropbox, that&#x27;s the competition I would fear.<p>Anyway, peer2peer when implemented right works better than the server-client model, at least on broadband connections that can afford the upload (sadly, doesn&#x27;t work so well on mobile phones, either because of battery life or bandwidth limits, but these are limitations that are not going to exist in the future).

Wasn&#x27;t that obvious from the press release ?<p>> In the wake of large-scale Internet surveillance and reduced trust in the internet, the European Commission today proposes a key reform to the way the Internet is managed and run. The proposal calls for more transparent, accountable and inclusive governance.<p>This is the justification. What do they want :<p>a) Control over IP address assignment and root DNS zones.<p>In other words the power to force anyone off the internet, and the power to revoke and/or change any domain name. They have long attempted, futile, to force thepiratebay off the internet, they even managed to force on of their hosters to kick them out once.<p>b) A strengthening of the global Internet Governance Forum<p>I read this as that they are aware that ICANN and IANA have no real power. The real power is in the hands of &quot;tier 1&quot; ISPs and they are locked into an open internet because there is no monopoly.<p>In other words : they want to eliminate the historical accident that lead to the current level of internet freedom.<p>c) &quot;A review of conflicts between national laws or jurisdictions that will suggest possible remedies&quot;<p>Now this one is REALLY important. I read this to mean they want to know how they can impose European law globally through technical means.<p>Now of course the EU commission itself does large-scale internet surveillance like the US does. With 3 important differences :<p>1) the cost is borne by the companies, not the EU. Everything is purely based on legal threats, and everybody is everybody&#x27;s adversary. Meaning for actual crimes, (e.g. missing child) it&#x27;s effectiveness is pretty much zero.<p>2) The US has a minimal level of legal oversight. Yes, we&#x27;re talking secret courts, and top-secret subpaenas. I don&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s ideal, but it&#x27;s better than the EU. Here&#x27;s how it works in the EU. Firstly any of the executives of the member nations can decide to get information, plus a set of &quot;blessed&quot; EU agencies, like interpol.<p>Second as opposed to the US where at that point an order is delivered to the intercepting party, where it is evaluated by legal (hopefully, and usually), and then complied with, in the US an ISP is forced to provide interception capabilities on a government VLAN, where they enter the IP(s) they want intercepted and get a live traffic dump. It is actually a crime to check what the government is spying on.<p>3) Unlike in the US, this data has actually been used for large scale copyright blocking (google &quot;French 3 strikes law&quot; without legal recourse. Yes that&#x27;s what they used their spying powers for.<p>Their objective is NOT to eliminate American spying on Europeans, but rather to &quot;harmonize the regulations&quot;. In other words, they essentially want access to the NSA data about Americans without oversight. They want to make sure Americans can get disconnected when the MPAA claims 3 times they&#x27;ve downloaded an mp3. They want the ability to disconnect sites that violate EU expression laws (e.g. criticism of some royalty, various outlawed political factions like nazism and marxism, European libel law, trademark protection, ...), they want companies to have to ask them (meaning: pay them) for permission before offering something like Uber anywhere in Europe. They want tax income for international purchases.<p>Please keep what the UN and the EU are trying to do in mind next time you hear Europeans complain about NSA spying. The only thing the commission is upset about is that they can&#x27;t spy on Americans the way (they think) Americans can spy on the EU. I&#x27;m saying &quot;They think&quot; because while the NSA does appear to have invasive spying, it seems extremely unlikely to me that it has anywhere near the claimed breath.<p>Please do NOT make the mistake to think this criticism anything but a concerted effort to kill the Internet. It is no different from the UN efforts to do the same [1]. This is the government that didn&#x27;t so much as voice concern about the protest killings in Turkey.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57444629-83/u.n-takeover-of-the-internet-must-be-stopped-u.s-warns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57444629-83/u.n-takeover-of...</a>",1392214078

I witnessed the 2013 layoff action and witnessed many good people in Australia and Singapore laid off in the name of cost-cutting.  It is mentioned in the article that for this 2014 round, people with even PBC 1 and 2 were fired, which would have been the top performing people on their teams.  I worked as a project manager doing datacenter/infrastructure work for IBM and was based in China.  On my most recent PBC before I left, my manager gave me a 1, and I was managing a program for innovation projects in the Asia Pacific, as well as in charge of quality control work as part of IBM&#x27;s global quality program called Global Delivery Framework (GDF).  Project team members under me came from Australia, China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan.<p>Firstly, it is not surprising that this is happening.  The technology in the IT industry has changed, and IBM was late to the cloud party.  We were still manually building servers for projects as of the end of 2013.  I myself was put in charge of a large project to virtualize hundreds of internal IBM application servers.  Let&#x27;s say that again: as of 2013, there were still hundreds of mission-critical IBM internal applications running on physical hardware until I was given the project to transition them to virtual servers.  They now have the ability to run stuff virtually thanks to some new hardware they&#x27;ve installed, but processes are still very manual.  As I was leaving, I told all of my teammates to be careful and get out while they could, because as soon as IBM went full-steam into cloud, all of their jobs would get automated.  It takes anyone a few minutes to get a server with applications running on a cloud service.  At IBM, it took me a month because everything had to be installed and configured manually, and the teams were always so busy that you had to wait until someone was available to do their part, whether it was installing AIX, installing DB2, configuring monitoring agents, configuring backup agents, doing BAU handover checks, whatever.  If you were IBM&#x27;s execs, which would you choose?  The writing was on the wall for a long time.  And while elephants can take a while to get moving, it is true that they can eventually dance, though they can cause a lot of damage when they finally do get going (and need to dance more frenetically to make up for lost time).<p>Secondly and more importantly, it&#x27;s sad that India was hit first in such a massive way, but it&#x27;s not unexpected.  I have nothing against Indian people and I think the situation is unfortunately more to do with IBM than it does with India.  IBM was truly scraping the bottom of the barrel for their hiring, and in India, they went below the barrel in order to cut costs.  It wasn&#x27;t enough, as they went too far and hired too many people who were not capable of actually doing their jobs.  I have plenty of examples, but we had sysadmins with senior in their titles that rather deserved to be labeled junior.  My colleague beside me, a program manager of another program, turned to me exasperated when one of the Indian project managers in her program couldn&#x27;t figure out how to fill out a project change request template.  So the project manager wanted my colleague the program manager to fill out the form instead.  Templates are there to make it clear what you&#x27;re supposed to write.  This level of incompetence was a trend, but I want to make it clear again, this is not the fault of the Indian people.  This is the fault of IBM deciding to not have high standards.  When the entire Domino team in Australia was let go (Domino is IBM&#x27;s mail server) and replaced with a new, inexperienced, and untrained team in China, yet another colleague was again exasperated.  Maintenance work that required only 6-hour change windows in her project became such that they needed 2 entire days because the new Domino team didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.  Again, it&#x27;s not that the Chinese people were the problem.  It&#x27;s that IBM wasn&#x27;t willing to pay to hire high-quality people, nor invest into training the people they did hire.  As for why I think the issue of high/low standards is a bigger issue than technological change, I point you to an anonymous posting I made on Quora once.  Being anonymous doesn&#x27;t seem so important now.  <a href=""http://www.quora.com/IBM/What-are-the-weaknesses-of-IBM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/IBM/What-are-the-weaknesses-of-IBM</a><p>I tried copy-pasting the Quora post here, but then HN told me that my comment was too long.  :D<p>edit:  clarification",1392213982

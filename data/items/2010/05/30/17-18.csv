It is your obligation to decide if moving sideways into my car is the right move.<p>Please don't  stick to ""the letter of the law"" in Ontario. I respect your right to have an opinion about this, but would despair if such a choice resulted in injuries or death.<p>In Ontario we have no-fault insurance for exactly this reason. If you choose not to respect someone else's signal and an accident results, you are both getting dinged for the cost of repairs. Your failure to ""drive defensively"" is your fault, regardless of the official rules for right-of-way.<p>Fault is only of interest if the police end up laying certain types of criminal charges. You might escape fault if the other driver runs a red and hits you. You will not escape fault if you see another driver signal a lane change and you have time to slow down and allow them to change lanes.<p>If someone changes lanes into you and you had no reasonable chance to react, you're possibly off the hook. But there's really no reason to see someone signal a lane change and bull right through without being very certain that they know you're there and plan to wait for you to proceed.",1275242227

Okay!<p>I`m in the process of working 60-70 hour weeks to help bootstrap my venture, which is Deka Creative. I plan on moving to Chicago the first of July to start full time. I've chosen this venture for a few reasons;<p>1. As a programmer and business man, I've found it extremely difficult to work with designers in the past. A good designer is not only impossible to find, they are hard to work with when you do find one. (Hajrice does good work btw)<p>2. I've found an awesome co-founder who not only has a skillset that compliments mine, he is the first designer I found that I can actually work with.<p>3.

So us todo app developers shall not rest until every user class is accommodated :)<p>What's funny is that I thought I had boiled down the homepage to a succinct ""sell"" explaining the app. But looking at it now, I see that it definitely looks like a ""features"" page and not a landing page. And there is no reason I can't have an actionable form on the homepage. Still, I have a <i>traffic driving</i> problem, and my homepage optimization problem is secondary. But I think you guys have helped me lift the cloud I was in thinking the front page looked okay. It's actually starting to repulse me now, heh.<p>I know anything can be grown, and I will admit that my enthusiasm is waning, but I think it's because I'm recognizing right now that the main way I have to grow this is by just bombarding productivity/lifestyle bloggers about it. I KNOW that's necessary, and I would feel motivated about it if this was a ""business"". But it's not, and it's hard to drum up the fire to put on my marketing hat. I was hoping for more of a 2nd order effect from Lifehacker (e.g. smaller bloggers picking up the story and then blogging on their own) but it didn't really happen.<p>I think you're right that I'm wrong about todo lists being inherently private. I'd like to think of something more clever than wall-spamming, maybe achievements or levels etc, so even if you don't share, you still are playing a metagame by yourself on the site which may make it more sticky.

Hoagland draws special attention to the fact that this event occurred close to President Barack Obama's arrival in Norway to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.<p>On 2–3 February 2010, on the Coast to Coast AM radio show,[69] Hoagland announced that the Russian SLBM had in fact been captured by Dark Forces intent on preventing mankind's exploration of outer space. These Dark Forces, he explained, were probably headed by Nazi officers who had escaped into space after World War II. To Hoagland, this was a sufficient explanation of President Obama's desire to cancel Project Constellation, since Obama had clearly accepted that any attempt to return to the Moon would be thwarted by the superior technology of the Nazis in space.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_C._Hoagland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_C._Hoagland</a>",1275240785

[EDIT for disambiguation: I mean error in reconstructing the image at full RGB resolution, not error in what anyone has been saying in comments here.]<p>1. The antialiasing filter. This behaves very much like a defocusing error.<p>2. Demosaicing. Exactly what this does depends on the algorithms in the camera. It doesn't necessarily look much like defocus. (For instance, on some cameras I've worked with -- not consumer ones, FWIW -- you get demosaicing artefacts that produce a sort of tartan effect.)<p>If the antialiasing filter is strong enough that it destroys all information in the image below the Nyquist limit for the R and B photosites, then demosaicing can in principle be perfect -- i.e., lose no information that wasn't already lost by the antialiasing filter. But (a) that ceases to be true in the presence of noise in the sensor, and of course there usually is some, and (b) an antialiasing filter that strong throws away information because then you're not really using all your green photosites. So in practice, sometimes you'll get ugly high-frequency demosaicing artefacts. Presumably designing a good demosaicing algorithm is largely about making this happen as seldom as possible for real-world images.",1275240601

The commit is your fixed monthly charge (and bandwidth) you pay for each month regardless of how much you use. Overages, calculated with the 95th percentile formula, are paid at the burst rate.<p>> The microwave backhaul is connected to a 100 Mbps port which would come out to $9/Mbit/month. From what I&#x27;ve seen, that&#x27;s higher than what you&#x27;ll pay if you&#x27;re connecting to an upstream in a well-connected facility. If we then assume 95% billing and peak usage at 30 Mbps, that&#x27;s an obscene per-megabit rate.<p>Well, yes. I remember Hurricane Electric running a promotion for 1 Gbps of IP transit for $360 a month, but then again they are not present at a HE PoP.<p>As to pricing, it sounds like run of the mill rural charges. Also we don&#x27;t know their commit, so can&#x27;t really calculate with Mbps rate. Perhaps they just decided to go with a zero commit and $30 burst rate instead of paying a flat fee of $1500 for the 100M port. Would make sense at their very low usage rates.",1446448837

Thus, you only see the more pro-social people in a rural area.<p>For example, we think of people in rural areas as being those who love the outdoors, they get out a lot into nature, exercise a lot, more than city slickers, right? Except no, they&#x27;re actually less healthy than urban residents. Sure, there are some there who really are going out into nature constantly and are in fantastic shape, but what you don&#x27;t see are the people who just sit at home all the time watching TV and smoking, because there just ain&#x27;t that much to do - <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304793504576434442652581806"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023047935045764344...</a>",1446447928

This is why I find libertarianism to be close to theology; when I start asking really difficult questions, you will refer me to some book, which turns out to be hopelessly circular (as in the case of property, which is defined in terms of non-coercion, which is also defined in terms of property).<p>It seems that you want to have world black and white, and so you invent new categories to deal with difficult moral dilemmas. But personal ethics is not something coming from a book, it&#x27;s a result of intuitively answering these questions (by &quot;feel&quot;) and sometimes accepting that there is no good answer, or that answer depends on different circumstances.<p>> look to the current system in the US (or most other Western countries) for answers to your questions .. it&#x27;s a reasonable approximation to my ethic<p>Yes and no - that&#x27;s my original problem. When I ask you a specific moral question, the answer indeed seems quite reasonable. But then you&#x27;re (very definitely) against things like taxation or state (which are integral part of the Western culture). I would like to understand where this contradiction comes from.<p>Now that I think about it, the whole business of how libertarianism treats &quot;property&quot; seems kinda morally repulsive to me for a different reason. It seems to me that libertarians treat property as a kind of extension to human body, in a sense that someone losing half of their 1000-acre property forever is a comparable (or worse) crime to a homeless losing a toe to the cold. What I miss here, I think, is a certain &quot;normal&quot; sense of proportion (or even admission that there is a proportion).<p>Anyway, I appreciate the discussion, especially given you were the only person willing to respond to my original post.",1446447626

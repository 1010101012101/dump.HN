Raising averages due to composition changes is pointless.<p>Nowadays, Finland has much of the same rate of immigration than US. Historically it has not been so. But today, around 20000 people move into Finland every year. Whereas the US gets a bit more than one million new inhabitants. Finland has 1/60th of the population of US. The performance is still better, though there is the same ratio of first-generation immigrants.<p>And I'd guess a lot less people relocating around the world know Finnish than the dominant teaching language in the US...",1325541308

Then it starts killing backgrounded apps. If it kills 'em all and memory is still tight, running apps get level 2'ed. Then it starts killing running apps.<p>So a well behaved game that's running close to the capabilities of the device is likely to do a bunch of stuff that will impact its performance when it gets that level 1 warning. It's going to purge caches and otherwise free a bunch of memory, and you'll see stutter. Furthermore if Mail.app and friends are running, they are probably also going to get warned and eat some time cutting memory use.<p>Again, I don't know the exact cost, but I think killing suspended processes is pretty cheap and it is really the memory warnings that cause a stutter.",1325541300

You don't dismantle the Bill of Rights just because you have to delay the military salaries for one month, until Congress rewrites the bill.<p>The problem with Obama is that Congress knows he's, for lack of a better word, a <i>coward</i>. So they know that they can push his hand how much they want, because he won't do anything dramatic to react and fight back. That's why Obama has kept losing all his negotiations or he always ""compromised"" for the other side's sake.<p>So bottomline, he should've taken a stand and vetoed it, <i>and let that be a lesson for Congress for next time</i>. But he didn't do that. And if you're going to say ""but Congress would've passed it anyway with 2/3 of the vote"" - well then, even more of a reason to veto it and show his supporters that at least <i>tried</i> to stop it, but Congress was solely at fault for passing it.

There's a wonderful story on the first page of Milan Kundera's ""The Book of Laughter and Forgetting"", which reads as follows:<p>In February 1948, Communist leader Klement Gottwald stepped out on the balcony of a Baroque palace in Prague to address the hundreds of thousands of citizens packed into Old Town Square. It was a crucial moment in Czech history - a fateful moment of the kind that occurs once or twice in a millennium.<p>Gottwald was flanked by his comrades, with Clementis standing next to him. There were snow flurries, it was cold, and Gottwald was bareheaded. The solicitous Clementis took off his fur hat and set it on Gottwald's head.<p>The Party propaganda section put out hundreds of thousands of copies of the photograph taken on that balcony with Gottwald, a fur cap on his head and comrades at his side, speaking to the nation. On that balcony the history of Communist Czechoslovakia was born. Every child knew the photograph from posters, schoolbooks, and museums.<p>Four years later, Clementis was charged with treason and hanged. The propaganda section immediately airbrushed him from history and, obviously, from all photographs. Ever since, Gottwald has stood on that balcony alone. Where Clementis once stood, there is only bare palace wall. All that remains of Clementis is the cap on Gottwald's head.'<p>[What are apparently the two versions of this photo can be seen at the bottom of this page: <a href=""http://www.internationalschoolhistory.net/central_eastern_europe/1945-1953.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.internationalschoolhistory.net/central_eastern_eu...</a>]",1325539549

For example, the URL <a href=""http://icanhasnoise.com/123456/200x200/4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icanhasnoise.com/123456/200x200/4</a> would generate a noisy background with color #123456 (gradient backgrounds are also supported), size 200x200 pixels, and with a 'noisiness' value of 4. This URL can then be slotted into to a CSS background-image rule and voilà, your element is noisily backgrounded without the involvement of any sort of image editor, and if you want to tweak the background, all you have now to do is change the URL.<p>I built this website to scratch my own itch and I hope that others will find the site useful too.

I didn't really mean to go off on you or anything but I just felt like there was this pattern I notice around here sometimes. And I'm speaking generally here so what I'm about to say ismt directed at any one person, it's really for all of us including me because I've been very guilty of it sometimes too.<p>Sometimes I'll see someone talk about some open source project and call it shitty and tear it apart needlessly. We all need to remember that not every project starts out great. The creators put a lot of time and energy into giving us something that we could all use and even expand on for free. It might not be the greatest piece of software but bugs can be fixed and we should appreciate that someone gave us a head start on making something amazing from it.<p>Not every open source clone is bad. Clone != unethical or shitty. Sometimes it does but not always. I know for a fact that there are a ton of people looking for a self hosted StackOverflow style forum out there and I'm glad someone made it and open sourced it.<p>It's one thing if the creator is out promoting the thing like its great but really isn't but I don't think it's fair to come across something like this and call it crappy and I've seen it a bunch. Maybe we can do better, maybe not. If we can then we should go ahead and do it instead of tearing down others.<p>There's a running trend of hackers having to be the smartest person in the room all the time and that's just silly. I much prefer being the dumbest guy in the room, climbing the ranks to be the smartest, then switching to another room where I'm the dumbest again. That's how you grow as a person and a developer.<p>And one more interesting thing I see is this: a person will go off on how all software should be open source and piracy is okay because of x, y, and z but then turn around and attack an open source clone of something. How does that make sense?<p>And we all do it whether we admit it or not. Before we do it again let's use our judgement and really think about whether it's appropriate in the situation. Put yourself in the other person's shoes and then speak.",1325538677
3417366,comment,3416957,3417093,0,0,jonbischke,,,"You're right David but, as someone who has built a couple of marketplaces, I find that founders often don't spend enough time on the ""tougher"" side. The common mistake (been there, done that) is to spend something like 60% of your time building the harder side and 40% of your time building the easier side. Instead, you should probably spend something more like 98% of your time building the harder side and 2% of your time building the easier side.<p>Which is the harder side? Generally, it's the people with the money. :) However that's not always the case. If you've stumbled into a massive market with high demonstrated spend it might actually be harder to build the supply side. I'd side that's likely the case with a company like AirBnB (they've done a great job building both sides of course).<p>If you can build the more difficult side (usually demand) it will typically pull supply out. It typically doesn't work the same in the opposite direction.",1325538676

On a single job I've had upwards of a dozen people come up to me and ask for a business card because they're impressed by our work.<p>We're not going to get huge business by a sign on main street, we get business by just doing our job because you get interested customers who might be hesitant and have questions.

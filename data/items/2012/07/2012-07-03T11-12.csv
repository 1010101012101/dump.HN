Historically, civil disobedience as a form of protest against unfair or unjust laws has carried with it the implicit assumption that such disobedience will be punished, perhaps quite brutally. The reality of that punishment is a large part of what makes civil disobedience noble, and serves to provoke broader outrage at the state of the laws which permit such punishment to occur.<p>Modern copyright dissenters lack that nobility, and without punishment, lack any way to generate broad sympathy for themselves and outrage against the laws.",1341316392

A single host out of ~30 dying at Site A doesn't affect how the DNS load balancing responds, but a critical number does.<p>Due to broken DNS implementations in the wild, you ideally keep your per-site load balancers up in as many situations as possible (even if load must be shed, you keep core network and load balancers up) and redirect traffic from there to other sites.<p>For larger sites, the big choice is running a single AS global network where IPs can move between datacenters vs. running each datacenter as a separate network.  Advantages and disadvantages to each.<p>The big disadvantage of all of this is you're now spending a few million a month on salaries, infrastructure (various PoPs, network gear, etc.) before you've bought a single server or served a single page.

Your entire argument is predicated on the notion that ""family"" === Mother, Father, and biological children. This is patently absurd.<p>There are millions of infertile, adoptive, heterosexual couples who by your implicit argument don't deserve the protections and rights of marriage. However, if you expand the definition to include them, you must include homosexual couples too.<p>You're partially right. Marriage encourages stability. I would disagree that is the only reason for it though. More importantly what you're missing is that it's beneficial to society to have ALL families stable...regardless of whether they have biological children or not.

If they had called it INSTALL then it could be either UNINSTALL EXTENSION or REMOVE EXTENSION.<p>In summary: It is meant to be intuitive to people who are used to SQL databases.<p>EDIT: And yes, it does ""'create'-ive"" under the hood.

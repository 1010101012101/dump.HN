Im a huge fan of getting stuff done faster so if its cuts out a step Im all over it.  But Ill admit that QR tech has a some resistance ahead of itself before people get used to it.
Ill agree though that many QR codes annoy me when it just goes to a home page.  staples.com is not difficult for anyone to type in...<p>Im sure there is some character count threshold for the average user where a QR code would be worth the effort of opening the scanner app and scanning it rather than typing in a URL.<p>Then again there is placement, Im not going to be able to scan a QR code on a freeway billboard or on a car going by but on a subway or bus advert where Im already stuck in a spot for 10-15 mins and probably already have my phone out is great placement.

1. QR codes don't work on distances - state of the art image algoritms do.
2. QR codes mess with the brand appearance - basically H&M don't want a QR code all over an ad.
3. QR codes fail when there's reflection, dark dirt, and very skewed camera - state of the art image algoritms don't.

2930844,comment,2930553,2930757,5,0,2muchcoffeeman,,,"Back when the iPod came out, MP3 players were all about features. A pure feature for feature comparison of an iPod vs other players makes the iPod look bad. They were probably trying to play the social status card. This seemed to have changed when the iPod actually got new features like the camera, the clip. But I forget all the campaigns.<p>Let's look at the ad campaigns for the Mac and iOS devices. There was the Switch campaign where they had people talking about why they switched and how it made their lives better. The ""I'm a Mac, I'm a PC"" campaign which was a bit abstract but talked about what the Mac could do. And the iOS ads, all of which show you real life functions of the iPhone and iPad. The iPod Touch is being marketed as a game console and they are showing real games that you can play.<p>Contrast this to the current crop of Samsung commercials. All the ones I have seen on TV do not show the product in any useful way, do not show what you can do with their products and claim that you will be better for buying their product. They are all very abstract.<p>The Acer Iconia ads are much better but aren't very well made.<p>The Droid Does campaign was pretty good but a little impersonal. But there was also their initial iDon't ad which told you nothing about their device but subtly referenced their competitor. Then there was that Droid X space thing which was supposed to be what exactly? And then the Droid commercials where they try and show something that the phone can do and BTW, you will turn into some super awesome android guy.<p>So in recent times, Apple has not been playing the social status card so much. Also, geeks are just as vulnerable to the social status message. Just look at this ""Apple is over priced and it is all about marketing"" meme. Geeks are just seeking increased social status in a different group. But they want it just as much as the Apple crowd.",1314421499

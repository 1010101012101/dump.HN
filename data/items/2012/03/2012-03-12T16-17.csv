For some people, it's true.  But in some cases, you can get really buried because of petty issues, or in worst-scenario cases, forced out and left hanging to dry.  You may come out of the experience having learned a lot, but you may also come out of the experience very bitter.  See recently submitted article about Khalid Shaikh, regarding YouSendIt, Noah Glass of Twitter, Eduardo Saverin of Facebook, etc.  Yeah, all of these guys probably made big mistakes and probably didn't deserve to be one of the senior guys.  But the point is that they also didn't get a lot of help to develop themselves, whereas at a big company, the structure is in place to help develop people who need it (not always, but more often than in startups where everyone <i>has</i> to pull their own weight or die).  Another recent alleged example is Naveen Selvadurai of Foursquare, though that guy has done a good job of taking the high road if it's true: <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/naveen-selvadurai-tried-to-fight-his-departure-from-foursquare-2012-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/naveen-selvadurai-tried-to-fi...</a><p>5) The level of transparency and all the good stuff that comes with it is all dependent on the level of integrity of the startup's leadership.  There are lots of stories of founders who lie, mislead, and misuse the startup's money.<p>6) You can help shape environments, but it is also a natural psychological event that your environment shapes you.  If your founders are domineering, arrogant, and generally assholes, it will be hard for you to influence the company, especially since most of the early hires will either be similar or easily cowed into groupthink.  If you're not up to the task of standing up, you either become one of the cowed sheeple or get pushed out.  It's sad if an startup's (or any organization's) culture is like high school, but it can happen.<p>7) I'd say it really depends on the leadership's philosophies.  If it's a business type who's like ""I'm the CEO, this is my leadership group, and you guys are just code monkeys"", I'm betting you probably won't see this kind of culture where everyone can be involved in the hiring across the entire organization.<p>8) Already addressed somewhere in these comments.<p>9) Politics can exist in smaller companies too.  And when the group is as small and tight-knit as startups are supposed to be, if the politics exist due to poor leadership and poor culture, it will be an even more painful experience than in a big company.  After all, in startups, you can often spend all your time with the team when it's crunch time.  In big companies, more often than not, you have the option to go home and leave work at work.  It can become a lot more personal in a startup if the culture is bad.",1331571561
3694327,comment,3691090,3693626,2,0,swombat,,,"Absolutely not. There are many ways for a founder to get rich. Liquidity is just one of them. A pretty standard way is for the company to start issuing dividends. The founder is presumably a major shareholder, and so if a big dividend is issued, they'll get a big chunk of that.<p>Obviously if you've raised VC, then that won't work - though angels will probably be more understanding. So, the conclusion is, liquidity events are only necessary if you've raised VC money. So don't raise VC money if you don't have to.",1331571555

3694322,comment,3693438,3694113,2,0,glhaynes,,,"Actually, touch-and-hold-to-move/delete apps is one of the few interactions that iOS specifically pops up a message to let you know about the first time it becomes available to you (after initial setup). It's an interaction that works well once you know it but isn't easily discoverable, so while a popup message explaining it is undesirable, it's probably a good/needed thing to have.

A ""best practice"" might be more akin to ""if you're working on an already in progress project, don't start doing CamelCase if they're using-dashes, or vice-versa"", IMO.<p>Another controversial one is whether or not to have each style on it's own line, or in the same line.  The author prefers a new line for each style because it makes for easier diff-ing in version control.  The argument could be made, however, that this style introduces too much whitespace and vastly reduces the number of styles you can view at one time, not to mention increasing the linecount of your stylesheet by at least a factor of 3.  Neither is, IMO, a ""best practice"", it's just a developer preference (IME most devs do agree with this doc, however).<p>There's some other stuff that really just boils down to how the author prefers to read his CSS, and not really about how to structure it in a proven optimal way. I believe it's hard to argue that those are ""best practices"", something Wikipedia describes as ""consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means"".

Of course it ties into the 2nd reason in that many people aren't motivated to learn what a proof actually is.<p>The ""impossible to absolutely prove"" phrase has a misuse of ""prove"". A proof is absolute. A proof is either valid or invalid judged solely on whether it follows the rules of the predicate calculus (or the rules of some other proof-framework you're using which is likely using the predicate calculus or an extension behind the scenes anyway). A proof's conclusions are ""true"" if and only if they are true. ( <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth</a> )<p>It is true (so far as we know, we might be wrong in the end) that we can't be absolutely certain that something is false, but it's the same case for being absolutely certain that something is true. (Here ""absolutely certain"" means ""no admittance to even the possibility of being incorrect"".) This is more generally identified as the problem of induction, but it's more of a law than a problem. One can guess from the name it has to do with inductive arguments that rely on guessing+evidence rather than deductive proofs that rely on accepting premises (which may be true or false) and a proof framework like the predicate calculus.<p>Edit: Have a Feynman video on UFOs. :) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLaRXYai19A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLaRXYai19A</a> When he says ""I can't prove it's impossible"", the interpretation you should take is ""I can't produce a set of premises we can all agree with that leads to a deductive proof that UFOs are impossible.""",1331570900

It doesn't seem like much but it makes a difference when you're writing up to more than 1000 lines for one CSS (I type every word using Notepad++).<p>Second reason is: by removing this space, it <i>joins</i> the property (margin) and the value (0) together. And because I write my CSS in lines, it makes a difference when scanning visually.<p><pre><code>  input { background:white; border:none; float:left; font-size:14px; margin:0; padding:5px; width:400px;}

is easier for me to scan than<p><pre><code>  input { background: white; border: none; float: left; font-size: 14px; margin: 0; padding: 5px; width: 400px;}

because I can easily target any <i>pair</i> property/value.<p>And the reason I don't mind the lack of space after the colon is probably because I'm French and in French there needs to be a space before and after a colon.

    5. Video (e.g. Kinect, eye tracking)

In video games, going all the way back to the Atari 2600, we've seen plenty of new types of input controls tried and failed. Joysticks, rotary controls, gamepads, keyboards, mice, trackballs, touchpads, light guns, robots, power gloves, giant floor-mats with buttons, analog sticks, analog buttons, vibrating controllers, skateboards, drum kits, guitars, microphones, steering wheels, arcade sticks, etc...<p>Some were great, some were terrible. The ""great"" tended to be so because they were tailored to the software they were programmed for. Playing Guitar Hero with a guitar controller is good, but playing Call of Duty with it is bad. There are plenty of different types of inputs that exist and will be invented, but some work best for some things and terrible for others.<p>As you mention, Microsoft Office is designed around a keyboard and mouse. A touchscreen is a hybrid of the two, more portable, but clunkier. An accountant who lives by arrow keys, hot keys, and their numberpad in Excel is going to hate a touchscreen. For MS Office to work on a tablet, it'll have to be re-designed from the ground up, and even then it may not be superior to its desktop counterpart in an office setting.<p>I don't know what MS wants to do with Win 8. To think all desktops are going to die and become tablets is wrong, just like thinking that T.V. was going to kill radio. Both have their places, but a tablet != desktop.<p>Maybe you're right that they just want a ""quick success"", but that strategy hasn't paid off for them recently (Zune vs. iPod, Bing vs. Google, their fragmented mobile efforts vs. iPhone). MS has been in reaction mode for a while, and now they're reacting to the iPad with Metro.<p>One thing Microsoft does have going for them is the corporate market; Apple hasn't directly targeted that yet, though to think that Apple is not going to go after it shortly is foolish. MS is entrenched in here with Active Directory and Exchange. But cloud efforts are going to shortly give that a run for its money.",1331570145

       Use `from random import SystemRandom()`.

    2. PyPi should not be used with abandon.

    3. Use HMAC for hashing (and salt).

3694167,comment,3693447,3693447,30,0,srean,,,"This is more of tweak of naive Bayes than Bayes' theorem and I suspect he is being a bit tongue in cheek and not letting on whats behind the tweak.<p>I am sure you have heard that naive Bayes makes gratuitous assumptions of independence. What is not mentioned as often is that it also assumes the document has been generated by a memory-less process.<p>So if I were to generate a document according to the model assumed by naive Bayes, and I want to decide if I should concatenate another ""the"" in the document, then I dont need to keep track of how many ""the""s that I have already added to the document. As a result the probability of multiple occurrence <i>n_i</i> of a word <i>i</i> goes down exponentially, like this<p><pre><code>  P(n_i) = p_i^n_i.
</code></pre>
Many words do not behave like this. Their probability do not go down monotonically from the start, rather, for words like ""the"" their  probabilities (conditioned on their history) climb initially and then go down.<p>Naive Bayes works surprisingly well in spite of their grossly violated assumptions. There are many explanations for that. However, we usually forget that to make NB work, we have to throw away ""stop-words"". Among them are those exact ""memory-full"" words that violate NB's assumptions.<p>Lets get back to word frequencies: A model that fits word frequencies quite well is the power law. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law</a> They look like this<p><pre><code>     P(n_i) \propto  n_i^c
</code></pre>
where <i>c</i> is a constant for that word id <i>i</i>. For English, <i>c</i> usually lies in the ball park of -1.5 to -2.1<p>The tweak that Norvig mentions is  not an exact match for power law assumptions but it comes very close. Its using a power law assumption but with sub-optimal parameters. In fact using the power law assumption and with their parameters estimated from the data you could get an even better classifier. Though be careful of the industry of seeing power laws everywhere. Log normal distributions can look deceptively similar to a power law and is more appropriate on many such occasions.<p>Yeah Naive Bayes has a bad assumption of independence, but there is no reason that they  have to be memory-less too and that is partly what the tweak fixes, and the theorem isn't really being violated.",1331569883
3694166,comment,3693501,3693886,8,0,redcircle,,,"> I'm convinced that watching TV is harmful to a child's intellectual development. (And there's an established body of evidence to support that.)<p>There might be evidence that early exposure to television, before the child's neurological development is ready to deal with it, is harmful.  But I'm not aware of ""an established body of evidence"" proving that TV is harmful.  Do you have sources?  I'm very interested in seeing such sources, as I used to be under the impression that TV is harmful, but I am now convinced otherwise.<p>Be careful ignoring the scientific method here.  You are equating a fear of bad side effects from TV with bad side effects with iPad use.  Fear is not the scientific method.<p>There are many dimensions to consider when evaluating harm.  For example, in early childhood development, the child desperately wants to imitate the adult (or role model), and will suffer certain side effects (e.g., problems with self confidence) if forbidden to imitate.  Thus even if there is harm in using the iPad, there could easily be more harm in forbidding its use (but this can easily be remedied by never allowing the child to see the adult using the iPad).<p>I urge you to be careful about following any lines of parenting that mold the child (e.g., the child <i>should</i> be outside playing ball, not inside doing X).  I see parents force their kids to conform with preset ideas of how a child should be, ignoring how early child development works, and thus cause pscyhological harm (e.g., internalization of fear of the parent).  An analogy would be the parent teaching the child how to walk by grabbing the kid's legs and moving them in micro-adjustments; the kid will end up with poor motor control.",1331569847

The old paradigm you're describing - download a solitary binary, double-click to install it across the system - is a huge security hole that Microsoft (for instance) has spent and will spend billions of dollars to patch around; the vast majority of exploits on Windows machines seem to be based on the fact that an unsuspecting user can easily download and run code that is swiftly given root access to their whole machine.<p>The repository system - a system where the set of programs available for easy download and installation is carefully managed and maintained - is an idea that was decades ahead of its time, and it's only just now that repositories (and their children, ""app stores"") are becoming a fact of life on lots of platforms. App stores are useful because they make things easier for users, but they're also extremely beneficial from a security standpoint. They also offer a simple, obvious, secure way for individual applications to be updated and patched when necessary.<p>tl;dr - Novice users should be <i>strongly discouraged</i> from downloading and installing standalone programs.

WebGL and the Audio APIs in particular seem on shaky ground for the moment... it seems there are still rather major security and performance problems to deal with.<p>The alleged WebGL security issues are mostly solved now. WebGL has about as much security issues as anything to deal with graphics, a computer can crash because of CSS 3D transitions almost as much as it can because of WebGL.<p>As for Audio APIs, open security issues are mostly to do with user permissions. The worst thing you can do currently is break the ears of the user and make the application unresponsive. You can do as much without audio APIs: var a = new Audio(); a.src = 'noise.mp3'; a.play; while(1);<p>As for the maturity of the APIs, WebGL offers most of the capabilities of OpenGL, except for a few quirks like Texture1D not being supported, more strict limits in construct sizes and referencing arrays (for some types you need to use constant value indices, unlike in normal OpenGL).<p>Audio APIs are in a weird spot now, we have two proposals, one from Google and one from Mozilla. Both have their virtues, and they offer solutions to a bit different problems. But at W3C Audio WG we are working on making these things better, so that eventually we'll get audio APIs across all browsers.<p>> Most worrying however is the utter lack of any non-TCP networking in the browser, not even at the specification-proposal stages. Any sort of real time multiplayer really kinda needs UDP to work efficiently. P2P is also fairly important for certain applications and is in a similar state.<p>This is indeed a huge weak spot, but it's hard to achieve securely. Making solid APIs for P2P connections, spanning more use cases than video streams would unleash open a galore of new doors, so I do hope WebRTC will bring forth a good solution.",1331568543

No part of the application should <i>require</i> that you can read in order to use it or navigate it.<p>2. Don't pop up dialogs that a child cannot understand.  For example, I watched as my child, while using an app intended for children, pressed ""OK"" on a dialog that asked if he wanted to turn on push notifications.  That's just ridiculous!  He'll press ""OK"" on any dialog because he just wants it to go away.<p>3. This really applies to all applications, but it becomes very apparent when watching a child use an app: the most desirable menu items should be larger and/or differently coloured than the least desirable ones.  I.e. ""Play"" should be a big, brightly coloured button, while ""Settings"" should be small and tucked away.<p>4. Don't make it easy to do destructive things like delete accounts.  This might seem obvious, but I have more than once opened an app only to find that my progress in it had vanished because my child had deleted my account (Plants vs. Zombies makes this too easy, for example).<p>5. On any app that has the potential to be enjoyed by both kids and adults, consider providing a kid-friendly mode that makes the game easier.<p>6. I don't know how difficult this is from a development perspective, but if possible, make the app resistant to having non-active fingers touching the screen while active fingers are attempting to use it.  Kids will often grasp devices, especially phones, in such a way that fingers from (say) their left hand are touching the screen, and on some apps this causes them to cease responding to touch events from their other (right) hand.<p>7. If your app produces revenue through advertising, it probably shouldn't be marketed at young kids.  Kids will press on the advertising and will just get frustrated when they arrive on a webpage somewhere, and adults will eventually delete the app because we don't want our kids feeling frustrated.",1331568423

You have to learn when to stop and when to do something else, learn to keep a balance.<p>At first we had small cards (like 2 x 10mn and 1 x 20mn for each day) to ensure he would not spend more time than we thought was good for him.<p>Now he mostly plays at his own rhythm, and tend to say at some point: ""Dad, I played a lot on the iPad, now I need to take some fresh air"".<p>Apart from that, all the remaining signs (learning to write, space placement, handling legos, social exchanges, sport etc) show no ""damages"" caused by the iPad :)<p>In conclusion: for me balance is everything (but like for most subjects); and there's a lot of good things to pick in the iPad.",1331568014

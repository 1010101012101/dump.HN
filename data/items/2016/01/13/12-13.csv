Obviously. Also, a lot is happening and very few are working professionally in several environments, so compare what they do every day, with what they do occasionally or maybe a long time ago. When I say I think Eclipse is a dog, that probably because the last Eclipse I used was Ganymede (2008) on java 1.5, hitting &quot;run&quot; and getting coffee before my jboss monster had started. I suppose a lot has happened there too.<p>Most IDE&#x27;s have much better navigation and autocomplete than VS does out of the box. When I say &quot;VS&quot; I really mean &quot;VS+Resharper&quot; as VS more or less useless without ReSharper.

10893921,comment,10893634,10893829,0,0,fgtx,,,"they have their own compiler. See: <a href=""https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2014/04/10/resharper-and-roslyn-qa/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2014/04/10/resharper-and-r...</a><p>> Will ReSharper take advantage of Roslyn?\nThe short answer to this tremendously popular question is, no, ReSharper will not use Roslyn. There are at least two major reasons behind this.<p>The first reason is the effort it would take, in terms of rewriting, testing and stabilizing. We’ve been developing and evolving ReSharper for 10 years, and we have a very successful platform for implementing our inspections and refactorings. In many ways, Roslyn is very similar to the model we already have for ReSharper: we build abstract syntax trees of the code and create a semantic model for type resolution which we use to implement the many inspections and refactorings. Replacing that much code would take an enormous amount of time, and risk destabilizing currently working code. We’d rather concentrate on the functionality we want to add or optimize, rather than spend the next release cycle reimplementing what we’ve already got working.<p>The second reason is architectural. Many things that ReSharper does cannot be supported with Roslyn, as they’re too dependent on concepts in our own code model. Examples of these features include Solution-Wide Error Analysis, code inspections requiring fast lookup of inheritors, and code inspections that require having the “big picture” such as finding unused public classes. In cases where Roslyn does provide suitable core APIs, they don’t provide the benefit of having years of optimization behind them: say, finding all derived types of a given type in Roslyn implies enumerating through all classes and checking whether each of them is derived. On the ReSharper side, this functionality belongs to the core and is highly optimized.<p>The code model underlying ReSharper features is conceptually different from Roslyn’s code model. This is highlighted by drastically different approaches to processing and updating syntax trees. In contrast to ReSharper, Roslyn syntax trees are immutable, meaning that a new tree is built for every change.<p>Another core difference is that Roslyn covers exactly two languages, C# and VB.NET, whereas ReSharper architecture is multilingual, supporting cross-language references and non-trivial language mixtures such as Razor. Moreover, ReSharper provides an internal feature framework that streamlines consistent feature coverage for each new supported language. This is something that Roslyn doesn’t have by definition.",1452689787

Whom ever was top of the list was first paged and if they didn&#x27;t acknowledge within x minutes we kept going down the list until somebody responded. Once you got called you owned all incidents for that night and the next morning you would be moved to the bottom of the list.<p>When we got called out we were well recompensed at minimum of two hours of 3x hourly rate. If you resolved incident in 10 minutes you still got 6 hours of pay. If you got another call within those first two hours then you didn&#x27;t get anything extra until you were working for 2 hours and 1 minute , but if the 2nd call came in after 3 hours you started the clock again.  During times of instability (new code release) we often had management agree to you working from first call-out until the day shift came in to order to minimise downtime. When we were working during the night the on-call always had priority, but if you were sat around waiting for the system to do something then we all did something else to keep us awake. But there was no expectation that it was other tickets or project work. We made personal choices of doing day work or it could be crossword puzzle etc.<p>We all had areas of expertise and if you caught something you didn&#x27;t know how to resolve then we had the authority to ring anybody. And that person would also receive the same compensation. In 5 years doing this I never had a complaint from calling somebody else out. Did we get tired yes? Most of us had project roles or team lead roles during the day but we all knew that the production system had priority and we and our own line management would deal with the project work accordingly. Did we get burned out on this? No because the rota meant that you still had a life. If you were top of the list and had other commitments that night you&#x27;d negotiate coverage with somebody else further down the list to see who could go top for the night.<p>My employer did this because the cost of not doing and having downtime during the day was a lot higher. If the system failed out of hours then it could impact our business and we could lose c.8,000 hours of day shift working time that would still require salary payment. Plus reputation damage etc. Most I ever accumulated over a weekend was 32 hours at 3x (situation so bad required to restore database to last known good and then catch-up log files).<p>One night I also got it wrong and in trying to correct the incident forced us into a situation when we had to do a database restore. That caused about 4,000 man/hours of downtime. When my bosses boss came in at 6:30am (he got called out by my boss) I got sent home being told I was too tired to continue support, day shift staff would take over and the missive to ring him when I had slept. I made the phone call expecting a significant dressing down only to be told, everybody else who looked at the diagnostics said they would have done exactly the same, we&#x27;ve all learned, and you stay top of the list tonight so that we know you&#x27;re not scared to get back on the horse. Truth be told it did knock my confidence and anything that was a little out of the ordinary after that I always ended up calling somebody else for a consult.

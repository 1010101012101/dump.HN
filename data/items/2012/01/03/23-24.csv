There just might have been a reason for that initial ban. As I've already stated, there's probably a good reason why PG doesn't reply to you (unfounded accusations, poor tone, being full of yourself and vaguely touting credentials while hiding behind anonymity), registering multiple accounts to evade a ban, etc.<p>If your submissions are so awesome, submit them here and let them stand on their own. At this point, you're screaming ""I AM RIGHT"" and are failing to articulate either your point, or any believability for your credentials (I suspect in part it's because you recognize that your brash attitude may not be winning you friends).<p>How can anyone be attacking you personally? No one knows who you are. You're being judged on the tone of your posts. Everyone here is telling you that, yet you have your fingers in your ears and you're yelling ""I'm being persecuted"". No one here is feeling sorry for you.",1325635169

It does connect; trust me on that one.<p>That was a good and helpful suggestion and should have been welcome.<p>> Later came these repeated and almost manic allegations of some secret cabal of MODs (using your capitalization) who are after you.<p>There's a LOT of evidence that some MODs are angry with me and for the past month or so have been attacking me personally.  For several reasons I've listed on this thread, much of the downvoting had to be from MODs.  Apparently HN is a PG PC sandbox, and MODs will downvote anything they feel violates the PC norms of HN and do so without responding.<p>PG won't respond to deny this.<p>I would have been a fool to ignore the clear evidence that I was being attacked and a wuss not to defend myself.  It's a scandal for HN, and PG has not responded.<p>On another user ID I was 'hell banned' here at HN.<p>Today I finally responded in plain terms to defend myself.  If by defending myself I get banned from HN, then so be it.  But for now the HN community will see that HN attacks some users personally.<p>I tried to help CS researchers get published.  My claim, easy enough to understand, is that the research paradigm of CS is largely bankrupt, and my recommendation is to further mathematize the field.  They are in a ""wretched mess"" if only from their statement of their ""problem"".<p>> puerile delusion of grandeur on display was mildly amusing and continues to amuse me<p>Insulting nonsense.  There is no delusion involved.  I was quite apparently attacked and have been several times for about a month now.  It's personal, not technical or anything else.<p>> if I may put it in my own words<p>My own words for my own statement were much more appropriate:  To repeat, CS is close to 'information technology', and there 'information' should be taken seriously mathematically.  The R-N theorem is one important approach.<p>The ""lack of background"" of the Editors in Chief and chaired professors of computer science was surprising and shocking.  I used some group theory and probability based on measure theory and got a new family of statistical hypothesis tests both multidimensional and distribution-free and applied them to ASAP detection of anomalies in server farms and networks, a good CS problem, and bluntly too much of the best of the CS community couldn't handle the math.<p>So, there is a big, huge gap between some of the best of current CS and what it would take to do at all well applying some 'modern probability' to some CS problems.  Due to this gap, my suggestion to learn the math is appropriate and should be seen as helpful.<p>In simple terms, if a student wants a research career in CS, then as an undergraduate it is much more important for them to major in math than CS.  And likely similarly at the Master's level.  That is a surprising point but potentially quite helpful and should be welcome.<p>""On other hand if you can show that your favorite Neveu calculus can be proved sound according to some computable logic, that would indeed be helpful.""<p>Nonsense.  Neveu is based just on set theory, axiomatic set theory if you wish, the foundations as in Bourbaki if you wish, or P. Suppes, essentially the same as all of math for the past 100 years or so.  For the importance of that material, there is nothing anyone should have to ""prove"".  'Computability' is not directly relevant.<p>> For example, to follow up on your own example, ... such a submission will just get dropped<p>I never had a submission dropped in the sense of 'rejected'.  For the paper in question, I sent copies to some journals and just asked if they would like a formal submission.  Some journal Editors in Chief said that their journal couldn't review the math.  With one such I wrote tutorials before he gave up.  So, I didn't make a formal submission and, thus, never got rejected or ""dropped"".<p>One journal welcomed a formal submission, and we went forward.  They had problems getting reviewers who could read the paper, and reluctantly I suggested a qualified friend who did a good review.  Eventually the Editor gave up, and for more reviews apparently the Editor in Chief walked the paper around his campus, had the CS guys say the problem was good and had some math guys say the math was good, and the paper was accepted, in an archival journal.  I was invited to present the paper at a conference but declined.  I just wanted to publish the thing and be done with it; I had no desire to go to a conference.<p>It's clear:  In being mathematized, the CS community is very short on the needed math.  I'm sure it's happened before, e.g., Hamming and the start of coding theory based on finite field theory, likely poorly known in the CS community then.  For a researcher with the math, there are important CS problems that can be solved fairly easily just sitting there and, thus, are good research opportunities.<p>E.g., in Feller II is renewal theory, and it has some obvious applications to a lot that goes on in a server farm or network.  For more, in Neveu is martingale theory, and there is one of the strongest inequalities in math (knock off the strong law of large numbers in one line) and more, and it's easy to find martingales in nearly any stochastic system.  Should be able to get some nice, new, strong inequalities in many algorithms and processes important in CS.  There's plenty that can be done with stochastic optimal control.  There are the applications of 'machine learning', that is, statistics done very badly, and can solve the problems much better with statistics done well.<p>For the paper I wrote, there's much more that could be done; one could run off a dozen or so papers as a 'stream' in roughly the same direction by changing some of the assumptions better to fit various real situations.<p>So, sure, I'm suggesting some 'field crossing', long known to be a good approach to 'innovation'.<p>Moreover I'm suggesting exploiting some of the best, rock solid math of the last century.  So this is a very sound, conservative suggestion.<p>That the CS community is very short on this math is a big point and a good research direction for anyone wanting to publish in CS.<p>Indeed, as is painfully obvious, CS has been taking intuitive and heuristic approaches far too seriously and neglecting solid math approaches.  This situation makes CS look dumb, but the flip side is a terrific opportunity.<p>Again, with the right math from the last century, now should be able to knock off important CS problems by the dozens like shooting fish in a barrel.<p>HN and you don't like this remark.  Fine with me.<p>I tried to offer some help, but you don't want to hear it and want to criticize me for offering.  Fine:  I won't offer.

Or are they approaching it from the stand point of ""this is how SQL allows me to interact with my data""? In my experience, it's very definitely the latter. As such, providing an interface that attempts to model relational algebra explicitly and treats SQL as an implementation detail doesn't cleanly map to how people actually think about the problem. This makes the abstraction obtuse and significantly more complex. At the simplest possible level, when I go to look up ""how do I do x in postgres,"" the answer will be in SQL, not relational algebra. Why force users to remap the way they think about the problem? Moreover, what do we actually gain by trying to map relational algebra to SQL? Why not work in SQL directly? That's what Korma does.<p>CQL generates lots of subselects in places that they aren't needed. I'm not looking at it from the stand point of the time it takes to generate a query, but instead how long it takes the generated queries to run. Subselects are slow. Generating queries that use lots of them is going to be slower than a system that doesn't. Could CQL better compile down to SQL? Probably, but it doesn't currently.<p>In terms of expressiveness, both allow for composition of SQL components over time, which definitely beats SQL itself.

You give an honest conservative estimate of how much time it's going to take.<p>Say it's a Rails CRUD app with no special domain code. Ok, 2 weeks, broken out into 2 billable weeks. The proposal says something like:<p><pre><code>   Week 1: 5 person/days, $5,000 (Setup, Discovery, Backend)\n   Week 2: 5 person/days, $5,000 (Front-end, testing, delivery)\n   TOTAL PRICE: $10,000\n</code></pre>\nAccompanying your proposal is a SOW that says something to the effect of:<p><i>This project will be billed on a time/materials basis, starting Monday January 23rd and continuing for 10 contiguous business days through February 3rd. If additional time is required to complete this project, it will be billed at a rate of $1,000 per person day, provided that notice is provided within 1 week of February 3rd</i>.<p>Presto, a proposal for a project that costs $10,000 billed time/materials at $1k/day (again, lowball figs).<p>Now, 2 weeks to complete this project is conservative. Also built into every proposal, whether you like it or not, is the collection of moments in every working day where you are not productive. So ask yourself, if I took 100 provigilsâ€  and eliminated ALL NON PRODUCTIVE TIME from my schedule for the entire next 2 weeks and completed this project in 7 days instead of 10, who should get that $3,000 of value I just generated?<p>The answer to that question is ""you"".<p>You don't generally want to rig your contracts so that they are padded out with unproductive time the client pays for; that's called ""rustproofing"" and it's bad business. But at the same time, clients actually value determinism more than they value any single billable day. If the client accepts a project for $10,000, they are going to be way more irritated if the project takes 15 days to finish than they are if you finish in 9 days instead of 10.<p>You have knobs to turn here too. Say you finish in 9 days instead of 10 because you drug yourself into working 18 hour days. Keep the $1,000. Say instead you finish in 5 days instead of 10 because the project turns out to be way simpler than you expected. Well, in that case, give the client their $5,000 billable week back. Think of this in terms of a minimum billable increment, where you don't credit partial weeks --- if you had to work at all in that week, that week is shot for other clients --- but will credit full weeks.<p>You see now how it's maybe not in your best interests to have your minimum billable increment be ""one hour""?<p>â€  <i>Please don't do drugs.</i>",1325632368

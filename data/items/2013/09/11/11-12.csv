If you try out the Smallest Federated Wiki below, you can drag-and-drop cards within a page, but the page doesn&#x27;t seem to built from cards (although it is). Pages can be created by composing cards and giving them lightweight styles (such as removing the visual frames around them, or showing them in list formats).<p>If it helps you, this is how I picture a system programmable  by the end user through cards:<p>- The structure is roughly like in the 10/GUI concept demo:[1]<p>* Information is organized in non-overlapping plaques.<p>* Plaques can be shown folded (cards), unfolded (pages) or minimized (links).<p>* Plaques are hyper-linked; clicking on links open related plaques like in the Smallest Federated Wiki. [2]<p>- Users can create new cards (this is what&#x27;s missing in current card-based systems, which are read-only):<p>* Creating a card&#x27;s structure is like creating a dialog in a traditional visual GUI builder, by composing small elements in a larger layout.<p>* The card&#x27;s behavior is programmed with the interactive comic-strip operations that Bret Victor demoed recently in the &quot;Stop Drawing Dead Fish&quot; demo. [3]<p>Does such system make sense? Can you picture it?<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/10gui-multi-touch-interface/13104/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gizmag.com/10gui-multi-touch-interface/13104/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/hsi.fed.wiki.org/hacking-social-impact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/hsi.fed.wiki.org/h...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://vimeo.com/64895205"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/64895205</a>",1378900790
6366593,comment,6363171,6365783,2,0,VLM,,,"Ex coworkers.  Last time I got a job traditionally and walked in cold to a job where I didn&#x27;t know anyone there was in 1994 or 1995 don&#x27;t remember exactly.  Ever since then its all been &quot;Yeah (fill in the blank) who worked with you at (fill in the blank) mentioned your name and the work you did with (fill in the blank) so I figured I&#x27;d give you a call and ...&quot;<p>I predict I&#x27;d be freaked out to walk into a new job and not know anyone.  I haven&#x27;t done that in twenty years.  I think I&#x27;d be lonely for awhile?  I have some respect for people who do that, its gotta be very stressful.<p>Even noobs can kind of apply this via school classmates and to a much more limited extent physical meatspace users group meetings.  Locally a makerspace is slowly bootstrapping itself and once its further along, I&#x27;ll join and meet some interesting people soon (the pioneers of the group only meet while I&#x27;m busy at work, so occasional mailing list interaction is possible, although not in person).<p>One hardware job interview a long time ago involved pulling circuit boards of stuff I designed and built at home out of my suit pockets during the interview.  The HR lady was stunned, and I was also stunned to hear that she was stunned.  Admittedly I was bringing analog to a digital gunfight but still... they&#x27;re looking for a hardware dude, and I got interviewed because I know a guy, but none of the guys you selected by yourselves personally own a soldering iron, and you&#x27;re hiring for a HARDWARE guy?  If HR screws up that badly, which happens often enough, if you can find any way at all to get in, you&#x27;ll basically be the only candidate.  There are probably ways for HR to do this with software, maybe HR ends up only providing java candidates but they actually need a Ruby guy and you&#x27;re a Ruby guy and via an old friend you get interviewed, well, I guess you win.",1378900686

This has been facilitated and enabled by an increasingly fascist government, which shows little respect for constitutional rights and personal liberty. \nPoliticians frequently use rhetoric and fear in order to ignite panic and entropy. Confusion is a means of control which allows them to exercise further control and rally support for their fraudulent wars and hidden agendas.\nThe revelation of secretive Intelligence programmes, such as PRISM, indicate a gross neglect of personal privacy. The basic right to human life no longer appears valid as we continue to witness unjustified drone strikes and night raids on poor rural villages throughout the Middle East. \nThe true &quot;terrorists&quot; are the puppeteers in charge of the most powerful nation in the world.

6366584,comment,6366537,6366537,18,0,Cbasedlifeform,,,"Interesting analysis by Dediu as usual (I&#x27;m a big fan and listen to his podcast regularly). I think a lot of people (including Horace and yours truly) are surprised by the 5C pricing strategy -- it&#x27;s not 5C(heap) but 5C(olor). I just looked at real world photos on Ars of the new models and from my POV the 5C models look like they are designed for kids. (A matter of taste, of course.) If Apple cut the price by another $100 they might make sense as a pricepoint but at only $100 less than 5S it seems crazy to me.<p>It&#x27;s notable there&#x27;s no black (or &#x27;slate&#x27;) 5C. I guess if one wants a more &#x27;dignified&#x27; (again, a matter of taste) one has to go 5S.<p>I commend to all the interesting Steve Jobs quote found at the end of the comment by markwilcox:<p><i>&quot;What ruined Apple was not growth  They got very greedy  Instead of following the original trajectory of the original vision, which was to make the thing an appliance and get this out there to as many people as possible  they went for profits. They made outlandish profits for about four years. What this cost them was their future. What they should have been doing is making rational profits and going for market share.&quot; - Steve Jobs.</i><p>As a long-time Apple fan and former shareholder I&#x27;ll be very interested to see how this pans out.",1378900469

6366523,comment,6366454,6366454,6,0,philipn,,,"I suspect the author doesn&#x27;t live in the US, as a few of his points don&#x27;t apply to US non-profit law.<p>In particular:<p>&quot;A charity (except in special circumstances) cannot pay a salary to anyone. Typically everyone who works for a charity is a volunteer.&quot;<p>In the US, when people talk about non-profits they&#x27;re usually talking about organizations with the 501(c)3 tax status (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501%28c%29_organization#501.28c.29.283.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501%28c%29_organization#501.28c...</a>).  Those organizations are further classified as either public charities or private foundations -- the former being what people typically mean by &quot;non-profit.&quot;<p>US non-profits almost always pay some people for some of their work.  There are restrictions on salary, insofar as you have to explain that salaries are justified to the IRS (this really only applies if the salary is beyond normal market rate).<p>&quot;A charity must disclose all of its financials publicly, in great detail, and be audited by several government bodies. &quot;<p>The same is true in the US, though non-profits do not have an audit requirement here.  Large non-profits typically hire a CPA to do an audit each year, though, as multi-million foundation grant-givers often require it.<p>&quot;A charity may only do things which have charitable purpose for public benefit, and nothing else.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t strictly true in the US.  A charity can engage in unrelated business, but it&#x27;s taxed on it and it can&#x27;t account for a substantial amount of revenue.  For instance, most Museums have gift shop, and selling stuffed animals isn&#x27;t usually their charitable purpose, so the organization will typically pay tax on that revenue.<p>&quot;A charity receives large amounts of tax-relief from the government for conforming to these rules.&quot;<p>True in the US -- non-profits don&#x27;t pay income tax and donations are tax-deductible.",1378899400

Automatically bracketing exposure and shooting in burst-mode, then analysing the results in real time for highlight/shadow clipping and sharpness, and then presenting the &#x27;best&#x27; photo to the user? Automatically combining twin tinted flashes for tone without mucking about with gels? That&#x27;s great stuff (assuming it works), and orders of magnitude more advanced than the &#x27;auto&#x27; modes on pretty much all other cameras.<p>It&#x27;s not going to replace good cameras used by enthusiasts who know their aperture from their ISO, but it has the potential to make huge waves in the snapshot category.

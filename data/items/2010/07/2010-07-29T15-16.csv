The difference is that this source is connected directly with the public (world-wide).  Its material is unfiltered (1) -- meaning what it does provide, rather than that what it provides is complete.  There is also the feedback loop of direct, public attention.<p>----<p>(1)  Actually, recent interviews with the New York Times and particularly the Guardian reveal that they sat down with Assange and -- over many hours -- reached an agreement to withhold some materials that would per their determination truly be damaging.

This is due to the fact that admission to elite colleges is a zero sum game.  There are X number of spots.  If you somehow diversify to get Z more members of group A then there will be Z less spots to go around.<p>Not really rocket science.<p>To me the two big questions really are:

It's counterintuitive, but if you look at e.g. Leica's exploding sales, or Macs, or indeed bare-featured Kindles, there's a pattern. In a perfect world (or, at least, one with perfectly consistent people) less features could never be worth more. People would do what they want and whether the device offers more choices or not wouldn't matter. Distractable as we are, however, every feature introduces a new decision calculus we need to make, and one more temptation against which we need to fight.",1280418782

He usually needs to wear glasses to read things close up, and even then, he has trouble making out words at times.  To my surprise, he was able to read the iPhone text much more easily than the reader's text, and keep in mind that the iPhone text by default is fairly tiny -- smaller than the reader.  I am guessing that the high resolution and the contrast helped him make out the letters.<p>I have not tried this on an iPad; I imagine it will be the same good experience as on the iPhone except with more of a book feel.  On the other hand, I have no interest in an iPad any more than any other touch tablet.

But the constraints that provide necessary support to mediocre teachers are a straitjacket to the good teachers... thus encouraging good teachers to abandon the field.<p>When I was an ed student, the guy who taught the reading-methods class said that direct instruction was absolutely an important part of a whole-language classroom; if you see that kids in your class are having trouble reading words with “th”, then you are doing nothing wrong in the sight of God and Dewey by taking them aside and presenting them with a lesson on “th”.  But a teacher in a whole-language class <i>who isn’t paying attention</i> will not realize what kids are getting stuck on and therefore will just assume that everything is going to work out, somehow, eventually.

Normally computer guys like me are selected to work in army's computer and communication centers, but I submitted my papers late and instead of working in such center I was selected to be a mountain commando squad leader (no joke). Even the officers who were giving us basic training told me people in my profession generally aren't selected (and suited) for that kind of training.<p>After 3 months of basic training (think of heavy marine training, but you climb up mountains as well) we were assigned to our squads and my squad was in the eastern warzone in Turkey, just near northern Iraq. During 8 months of my battalion service I was responsible for the lives of 18 men and went on to the missions which included searching for IEDs, securing roads for military convoys, patrolling base perimeter at night and ambushing terrorist routes during midnight. I repeat again, I'm just a decent computer engineer, and has no battle experience besides Call of Duty series.<p>My squad didn't have any casualities but other squads were attacked by both IEDs and automatic rifles, and some soldiers were injured. I guess I should consider myself lucky for that. It was a traumatic experience both for me and my family. My service ended in this February but still I have nightmares somedays.<p>So yeah that was out of my comfort zone, I really don't know if it did me any good or not.",1280417081

After a number of interviews where I was told, in as many words (or sometimes in not so many), that they would always give the job to a bilingual candidate over an English-only speaker, I took some time off from the traditional job search.  During this time I played poker to sustain myself and support my girlfriend as she started her own business.<p>I moved in with my Quebecois girlfriend and her six year old son.  I worked in carpentry for 6 months, completely immersed in a French/Italian speaking environment.  It was exhausting (I had a 90 minute commute each way and a 12 hour workday), I was working for a pittance (< $10/hour), I was broke and discouraged.<p>I eventually landed some independent development work and quit construction.  12 months later I landed in a very stable situation.<p>Without a savings safety net, I couldn't see myself doing that again.

I was wrong - staring at the illuminated screen quickly hurts my eyes in an otherwise dark room.

At least the problem wasn't keeping project files there. After all, most projects are just lots of source code, and it doesn't matter where it sits.<p>The big problem with keeping projects in there is that each project might have computer-specific configurations. I try to keep those to a minimum, by e.g. using relative directories whenever possible. For the few things that I <i>can't</i> keep completely relative, I rely on environment variables that I set on each computer I work on.<p>Other than that, I haven't run into any problems working right out of my Dropbox directory. At one point I considered running all my software from Dropbox (using portable versions), but that really did cause a lot of headache (most programs have session-specific configuration which would cause problems on different computers).<p>Have you run into any other problems with keeping projects inside Dropbox?",1280415849

1557783,comment,1557398,1557398,0,0,svjunkie,,,"The idea of an action always ""resulting in a positive outcome"" depends entirely upon the perspective of the person experiencing the outcome.  When you step outside of your comfort zone, something will happen.  You may find you love your new experience; you may find you hate it.  Either way, you are likely to learn from it, and depending on your time horizon, the newly acquired knowledge may result in ""positive"" outcomes for years to come.<p>Consider the situation described by @vyrotek: quitting your job and devoting yourself fully to a startup.  There's no guarantee that the startup will grow into a $100 million company or even a $1 million company.  You may go into debt, you may lose friends, your girlfriend may leave you because you can no longer offer the stability of a ""normal"" job.  Would that be a negative outcome?  Again, it depends.  Maybe your business ownership experience makes you a prime candidate for chief executive at a scrappy new startup.  Maybe your friends were more concerned with partying than with personal growth, and maybe your girlfriend was in love with your car instead of you.<p>Obviously, this example isn't all-encompassing and nobody can predict the future.  Sometimes, you just need to act without knowing for sure if you're making the ""right"" choice, and then continually evaluate that choice as you accumulate new experiences.  Nothing is permanent; if you take the leap of faith into the startup world you can always return to the job market later.  Of course, in this economy it may take you 8-12 months to find a new job so it's wise to have some savings to fall back on.<p>I stepped out of my comfort zone by moving to a completely new city and then deciding to purchase a franchise business with a friend.  I was extremely unsure about both decisions, but I'm glad I moved forward with both.  The franchise has been a trying experience, straining my friendship as well as my wallet.  However, we're starting to make money and get into a rhythm - an opportunity I wouldn't have had if I hadn't decided to jump in headfirst.  There are days I hate where I am, but the experience I gain every day is invaluable, and I'll cherish it for the rest of my life.",1280415832

Most union contracts are structured so that when the municipality has shortfalls and has to let teachers go (i.e. most municipalities in America over the last few years), the most recently hired teachers are the first ones to be let go, regardless of competence.  This is doubly damaging to the municipality in question, because those are the cheapest teachers, so more need to be let go in order to balance the budget.<p>But, as I said in the other thread, as long as the teachers' unions are the only ones sticking up for teachers while the taxpayers want to drop their kids off at school, drive to work on clean, safe streets, and then bitch and moan about the nerve of municipal workers actually expecting a paycheck, well..

of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will,
a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the
freshness of the deep springs of life.<p>Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of
the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists
in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty. Nobody grows old merely
by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.<p>Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the
soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirit
back to dust.<p>Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being's heart the
lure of wonder, the unfailing child-like appetite of what's next, and
the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my
heart there is a wireless station; so long as it receives messages of
beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the infinite,
so long are you young.<p>When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of
cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at
twenty, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch the waves of
optimism, there is hope you may die young at eighty.",1280415647

4739642,comment,4739395,4739564,5,0,MrScruff,,,"The fact that Android has more features than iOS doesn't really mean anything. There were existing smartphones that had more features than the iPhone at it's launch. It was the quality of the implementation of these features that made it stand out.<p>Now clearly Android is a far more capable OS than the smart phones OS's of 2007, but in some ways it still lags iOS. One that matters to me for example is the lack of a good low latency audio API. Audio production apps are very popular on iOS and some of them are ground breaking. This matters far more to me than NFC or wireless charging.<p>In addition, although Google plans to add (or maybe already has) a better audio API, there will be a huge lag before there are enough devices with the new API available, so most developers won't bother porting.<p>On the other hand, it's easy for Apple to add wireless charging or NFC since they're mostly hardware.<p>To address the original post, I don't think this is like Mac vs Windows. Apple is making a large share of the industry profits, and unless Android developers start suddenly making considerably more money than iOS developers it still has greater developer mindshare. Also, the premium Apple is charging for it's devices is less than it was for the Mac vs PCs duing the 80s/90s, and most of it is swallowed by the carriers.<p>I think it's clear Apple isn't going dominate the sales numbers, but I don't see any signs of iOS dwindling to near obscurity like MacOS did during the 90s.",1352033780

Both the UI and the framework went through a huge transition, both arguably hurt the developers and the users.<p>Nokia's abandonement of GNOME has nothing to do with GNOME 3. SUSE was a KDE distro from the very start, years ago. Ubuntu not shipping with GNOME 3 the UI by default is less to do with GNOME Shell and more to do with Ubuntu pushing their own thing (valid strategy, but not a response to GNOME 3 mess). The only major distro to react to GNOME 3 disruption is Linux Mint - which had to do so because <i>both</i> Unity and Shell weren't there yet.<p>Back to Apple envy and ""poisonous touch"" - whoever paid attention to what's going on with GNOME development knows there was (is?) much more Web ""envy"" (or rather panic: ""it's going to render the desktop obsolete!""). In fact, I'd say Apple in this case served as an example of an ecosystem that successfully pushed <i>against</i> the web and obsolesence of desktop (or rather ""native"") apps.",1352033285

And that's exactly the problem. Without data, who is anyone to claim that GNOME is gaining or losing users? Or market share, for that matter. Personally I love GNOME 3, but what I personally think doesn't matter one bit.<p>And while I respect Linux (sic) Torvalds as much as anyone, the fact that he is a kernel hacker means he is as far away from GNOME's desired target audience as anyone could be. His dislike of GNOME 3 could almost be seen as a positive sign.<p>I think the articles touches on many interesting things, such as:<p>- How and why did a number of distributions decide to go their own way? How does GNOME plan to respond? Maybe being the default for a smaller number of distros means less restrictions and less need for compromise, who knows.<p>- GNOME seems to focus on being great on touch devices, but how will they end up on those devices if they don't sell hardware?<p>- How can GNOME measure its success to know they're heading the right way? How do they define ""success""? If it's the number of users, how can it gather usage data?<p>Those are the things I'd like to know more about. Not empty claims of users leaving in droves, or the suggestion that the only way GNOME will survive would be to return to its old ways (because back in the day, GNOME 2 dwarfed Windows and OS X, right?).<p>(I've read it a number of times now, and I am still completely in the dark as to how Apple ties in to all this.

Every new release of iOS is packed with things that Android has had for years.  Android is still lagging behind in polish, and iOS is utterly dominant when it comes to gaming.<p>Google spends more than twice what Apple does on research (that's after Apple bumped up their R&D budget too!).  Apple is going to be playing catch-up in terms of features for the foreseeable future.  Google has taken some steps to improve their polish, such as project butter, but that bright future is most unevenly distributed.  Google's attempts at polish will likely be thwarted by the same thing that scares off game-writers:  fragmentation.<p>In the near future, I think Android will take the lead and become the better OS, <i>except</i> for gaming.  Google is putting too much effort into polish not to catch up quick (with their premier devices at least) while Apple isn't doing enough to close the feature-gap and is actually falling further behind (e.g. NFC, wireless charging, etc.).

That’s because with wearables, there is a sort of third axis beyond performance and power: volume. The Moto 360 is double the volume of the small Apple Watch, an unpleasant difference and one that almost no one will stand for at a given price tier when holding the two devices. If wearables follow fashion, you could make a case for Apple owning this category. </i><p>Interesting angle.",1412042289

There&#x27;s not a lot of nuance, just a total ordering, from more free speech, to less.<p>&#x27;Hate speech&#x27; restrictions aren&#x27;t primarily &quot;about defamation&quot; or even threats. Those are already handled by  actual defamation and assault law, with stricter standards of harm.<p>&#x27;Hate speech&#x27; rules add extra penalties based on motivation or message. They aim to penalize when listeners are simply offended, and even when the speech is trivially true.  For example, most verboten slurs against group X, when unpacked, simply mean &quot;I see you as X and I dislike X&quot; – which is almost always a self-certifying utterance, and reveals more about the speaker than the target. So let them speak.<p>Phrases like &quot;Free Speech Zones&quot; are a lot like saying that free speech is a &#x27;nuanced&#x27; matter.

And then, as more people switch to them and the demand for oil relaxes even a little bit, the oil price can fall dramatically as well, until some of those alternative choices don&#x27;t seem as economical.<p>Even just a simple model like that can explain all sorts of brain-numbing conversational patterns.  Like the certainty that big oil has had the knowledge of clean, cheap energy and that they keep it secret to make money on oil... or that they&#x27;ll pump up oil prices to lure the alternative energy people to make business risks, and then purposely flood the market in order to put them out of business, etc.",1412041356

How much (time/money/mind share) are invested in non-networked, desktop-style apps? Some, yes, but &quot;everyone&quot; seem to be (continuing) the push for networked apps (MS Office and Exchange/Sharepoint, Google (everything), Adobe/Macromedia with Creative Cloud, Apple iCloud ...). Mozilla is doing a cloud-push to, but have thankfully so far had a very strong self-host, do-what-you-please story. Not sure about the Firefox OS, though -- will we be able to (easily) host our own app store? Back-end services? At least for now the things I use (Firefox sync) is easy and feasible to self-host.<p>The one thing I could see giving a resurgence to &quot;off-line&quot; for mainstream use, is latency -- more concretely -- the low latency tolerance of VR.

Latency (which <i>can&#x27;t</i> be reduced below the speed of light without circumventing the laws of physics) is incredibly detrimental to drawing and digital painting, two of Photoshop&#x27;s most popular use cases. A frame or two of lag really hurts responsiveness (a frequent concern when using a large brush on a slow PC), and network latency to nearby servers in the US starts at around 30ms and only gets worse. Client side prediction helps a lot in video games, but predicting a graphics editor basically entails having the entire editor, at which point the &quot;cloud&quot; is doing nothing but storing your files.<p>I will never understand why people are so obsessed with the extreme of the thin client ideal. They are a good choice in a world where the network is fast and low latency, while client devices are underpowered and expensive (VT100s in a lab with minicomputer in the next room). Meanwhile, we&#x27;ve lived for at least the past two decades in a world where the network (on the cellular and home broadband ends) is slow and high latency but our client devices are incredibly powerful and cheap. The period of time where this makes any sense for anyone except for proprietary software vendors that want to close off any possibility of pirating their products has long since passed.<p>The appeal of &quot;compute clusters&quot; for most &quot;power user&quot; tasks especially diminishes when you realize that shitty off-the-shelf PCs from 10+ years ago were perfectly capable of running programs that did most of same stuff as their modern versions. New functionality has been added, of course, but most of the increase in resource requirements came from selfish programming from generations of programmers that never learned how to optimize. There&#x27;s no reason that a Chromebook with a cheapo ARM or low-end Intel SoC shouldn&#x27;t be able to natively run a better optimized graphics program like Paint Tool Sai with CPU time/battery to spare.",1412040947

These topics are critical for understanding how your costs add up, who pays them, and where the margins come from. I am surprised it didn&#x27;t get more votes.<p>The author&#x27;s claim is that labor costs are being pushed down, suppressed and hidden from public view. Yet if we examine a time series Chinese labor costs, the price inflation over the past 13 years is phenomenal: <a href=""http://imgur.com/rkEOiPj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/rkEOiPj</a> Even if workers are not being compensated the full amount they are owed, the competition for labor means they are being paid a great deal more (3x-8x) than they would have been paid in 2001. If we accounted for inflation, it isn&#x27;t as much but still there.<p>I strongly agree with the hidden & unpaid value of environmental pollution.<p>The author also should mention the hidden value captured by China&#x27;s artificially low interest rates and other government expenditures. I also did not notice anything about confiscation of land.<p>Plenty of problems with a supply chain involving countries where citizens have minimal to no rights.

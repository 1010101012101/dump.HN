991344,comment,991012,991194,0,0,vetinari,,,"> They deserve deference because somebody has got to secure our borders in this day and age, and like it or not, this is probably the best way to go about doing it. I'm willing to live with my feelings getting hurt if it means people aren't able to drive bombs over the border.<p>Have you ever been to EU? Or somewhere else? How it is, that these guys are able to act professionally, non-emotionally and secure the borders without acting like assholes?<p>This is not either-or situation, border guards can do their job without intimidation and beating people.<p>(The US border is in fact the worst one I ever went through. Makes you think.)",1260608125

991340,comment,991254,991307,0,0,patio11,,,"Many of the rural Japanese prefectures will give property away for a song just to get you to live there.  My previous job (technology incubator in central Japan) had a deal with the government where we got housed in the apartments normally used for government employees.  My rent was $20 a month -- which ""skyrocketed"" to $60 in my second year.<p>Think of it as the modern Japanese analog to the Homestead Act.<p>It makes excellent sense to the prefecture: they have the property whether someone is living in it or not.  If renting it out (free to them) induces one professional at the margin to live there, they get roughly ~20% of his wages in taxes and much of the remainder gets spent in the prefecture.<p>P.S. If any of you want to start a startup in Central Japan, and have some way of finangling your own visa, I can give you the forms to essentially make you ramen profitable for two years by government fiat.",1260607627

991336,comment,990222,991331,0,0,codexon,,,"Yes it's quite sad how I had to repeat myself 3 times. At least you understand :)<p>What I don't understand is why when anyone here sees the word ""zero-sum"" they rush in to talk about Paul Graham's explanation of wealth creation regardless of what the subject is.<p>And sadly I've since then lost 5 karma from people who like to jump on this ""wealth is not a zero-sum game"" bandwagon.",1260607268
991335,comment,990222,991171,0,0,forensic,,,"While what you say is true, it is a non-sequitor.<p>In reality there is not a fixed amount of currency, there is a printing press pumping out more dollars and the dollars are given to someone who then lends them at interest to someone else who then uses them to buy a trinket.<p>As the printing press makes more dollars, the value of each goes down, and so the wealth of everyone in system doesn't actually depend on how much currency they hold but rather the order in which they receive the more recently printed currency. The wealthiest are defined by those who receive it first. It is a pecking order. Whoever receives it last actually doesn't have enough to buy food because by the time he receives the currency, it is already too worthless to be used to compel food from the other members. He either abandons the system and lives off the grid, or starves to death.<p>So while in theory currency does not have to be a zero-sum game, our modern implementation of currency is indeed a zero-sum game.<p>And I say currency specifically because, as everyone loves to point out, basically anything is technically ""money"" as soon as it is traded.<p>P.S. Note that both pg and this fellow had the same people signing the checks - Yahoo. Yahoo is pretty high on the pecking order because it has always had excellent access to investment bankers who in turn have excellent access to banks who in turn have excellent access to central banks who printed the new batches of money. The closer you are to the central bank, the richer you'll be.",1260607171
991333,comment,990799,991060,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I disagree that hn's is the worst. Slashdot has a fancy system because the signal to noise ratio is so low there. Even reading at the maximum post ""quality"" level of 5 there is a lot of spam, off-topic banter, lame humor, etc. In comparison, I find the S/N here to be orders of magnitude higher. I think the reason that is so is that the HN system encourages certain behaviors which lead to better discussions whereas the slashdot system is more of a passive filter on a noisy feed, which is inherently a losing battle.<p>In theory I have a slashdot account that's about a decade old, I have forgotten the password and no longer use the email address it's attached to. I haven't bothered going to extreme efforts trying to recover it (e.g. searching out old password lists I have written down somewhere) nor have I bothered creating a new account. Discussion on slashdot is just not worthwhile, at best it's like trying to have a conversation by yelling across a boisterous lunch room, at worst it's just spitting into the wind (which tends to be the average case). There are so many better alternatives out there now it's really not worth the time to visit anymore.",1260607074

It means the cost of living goes down.<p>As long as you have a fungible currency - a liquid currency - deflation is a boon.<p>Everything <i>should</i> be getting cheaper as technology advances. The only reason it doesn't is because of the influence that codexon has been trying to explain. The currency game is zero-sum. It was designed that way. It's one giant pyramid with the BIS at the capstone.",1260606528

991327,comment,990382,990598,0,0,teeja,,,"I'm not surprised (at least for people trying to hire online) because I've never seen crappier job descriptions than those on the Web these days. Nobody leaves a phone#, they expect CV and won't answer the simplest preliminary questions by email. They ask for <i>outrageous</i> qualifications for the stipulated wages and positions. Very slipshod descriptions of the work, next to no details about the company ... and most of their websites tell me that they're strictly amateurs. That describes 85-90% of what I'm seeing.<p>It's has to be harder finding someplace worth replying to, when they act like they don't really care, than it is to find good people. Very few who are advertising positions know how to pitch a job.",1260606176

I'm not saying the EU is a bad idea. I'm saying that when the UK joined the EU it gave up a good number of freedoms it previously had - admittedly those particular freedoms were not considered valuable.

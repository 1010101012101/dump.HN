To be workaholics, sacrifice social life, home life, hobbies etc in order to build their companies.<p>While it's obvious that a lot of people do this and succeed it's not something that I'm sure other people want to do, it's certainly not something that I want to do. While others may see this of lack of commitment and consider me a non-serious business person, I don't.<p>I want to build a successful business that makes all the other stuff in my life better, more resources, more fun, more people to meet etc, but maybe that makes me a bad investment to VCs.",1284857936

Dish network has some pretty cheap plans.</i><p>I know the building MG used to live in - it is a modern downtown condo and you cannot install satellite very easily in those.  If he is living where I believe he is now living, it's the same issue.<p>I've heard that the FCC says everyone is entitled to erect a satellite dish if they want but that's useless if you live on the wrong side of a condo building or don't have a balcony.  And expect flak from the HOA if you do, esp if it's an up-market condo building.<p>What happens is cable companies do deals with the building developers to have cable run to each condo (""cable ready"") and in return the building agrees not to let anyone install a satellite dish on the roof.  Or they do have a communal satellite but it doesn't have an HD-ready LMB, which was the issue in my old condo.",1284857322

This brings up two downsides to this:<p>1) Consumer's know that the thing they purchased is not really under control...many people want to be able to do whatever they want with what they purchased. This is basically the same as a pay-per-use license like with software today...which most people absolutely hate.<p>2) It tells the market that the 2.00Ghz part is <i>way</i> overpriced. It's a powerful signal of how bad of a value the company is offering since you actually <i>can</i> but the 2.00Ghz part at the lower price, it's just artificially broken.

It doesn't happen, or happens negligibly often. The bigger problem is not that merchants get to ask for as much money as they want when you are there at the store paying for something, but that they now have your credit card number and can, if they are malicious, use it later, or sell it on the black market.<p>In comparison to your proposal, the new card being proposed can work <i>today</i> without any merchant making any change to their equipment.<p>And this new card will become very useful once they add something akin to SecureID: That is, after every swipe of the card, the credit card number automatically changes to a new one. This is done on the card, and on the credit card issuer server, so that when the user makes their next purchase, both the card and the card issuer agree what number is being used.<p>This would make it useless for people to steal credit card numbers. And having this built-in to your credit card, instead of having to go online every time, like some existing systems, makes it extremely convenient and easily adopted by users.<p>Basically, this would mean no change on the part of users, no change on the part of the merchants, and only change on the part of the card issuers (they need to upgrade their servers and issue new cards), which is great because it is the card issuers that are most impacted by credit card fraud, so they are the most motivated to make a change.",1284855162

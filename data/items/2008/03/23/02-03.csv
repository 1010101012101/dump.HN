I wonder how close IBM and HP were at their research peaks.  Also, I should mention that I wasn't intentionally picking on yc companies and perhaps that was the wrong choice.  Some of the technology coming out of a few of them seems to be more interesting than some of the best labs.  I know that isn't the goal, but it certainly isn't bad side effect!  I really only meant to pick on the droves of obscure, uninteresting <insert social aspect here> startups.",1206240539

For additional measure, you can even try purchasing advertising and making a youtube video but this is unnecessary. If people like it, they will spread the word, and usage will lift it higher on search engine results lists.<p>I was thinking that this should be turned into a firefox extension, but I see that you already did it.",1206240072

I take that to mean that you had the impression that those who were comfortable in a big company disagreed with Paul and those who didn't agreed with him. I just wanted to give you a counter-example  (me). I want to let you and others know that although Paul's article may be right about some things (to some people like me and you), other things in the article seem to denote a narrow and excluding viewpoint regardless of whether you're comfortable with corporate life. I don't think it would be too much trouble to acknowledge that there are career avenues that bring joy, challenge, fulfillment, learning, self-reliance, and responsibility outside of creating startups. Further, I would add that there are things outside of work that you should think twice before sacrificing lest you find that your great successful career alone is not enough to make you happy.",1206239946

143723,comment,143492,143492,0,0,mkn,,,"The real questions are, ""How long does this take in real time?"" and, ""How much like real life is this scenario?""<p>The default setting has trades of 20-day duration. 18 trades take one year, and to get to ten years takes ~183 trades. At 3.5% inflation, $141 large turns into $100 large in ten years.\nWhat the site really needs, in addition to the glamorous dollar amount, is an effective annual percentage rate (Instantaneous/Cumulative/Moving average would all be nice to see) of your investing strategy. That way, you could see the unglamorous effects of trying to beat inflation while crawling out of the hole you just dug yourself.<p>For example, I picked only apparent winners that had climbing moving averages for the last six months, climbing value for at least the last three, no major price shocks in the last six, and I held for 20 days. After 43 months I had $187,000. The value of this money was a little over $160,000 after discounting for inflation (%3.5 annually, as a guess). Approximately 14% per annum after inflation (and before taxes). This same strategy, unmonitored for time, yielded $15,000,000 earlier. Fiddling with logarithms gives me just under 17 years to attain this value (not adjusted for inflation, and you have to defer your taxes).<p>If it really is this easy, we should all be eating Ramen and working for Microsoft for $100,000 per year. After two years, you'd have your seed money, and could go work fast food to pay the rent while you pay attention to the stock market once every 20 days.<p>Am I the only one to whom this sounds a little odd? Could this just be that the data are taken ""at random"" from a bull market? Is it just that you can't find the proper 17 years in which to do this? Are all my wins coming from the bull markets? That is, am I (by choosing stocks that look great) actually choosing stocks from a bull market? Wouldn't this imply something about the feasibility of actually earning a living this way?",1206239114

I'm looking for 2br nice apartments, I have a wife and little son.  I hope to get as inexpensive as possible, but I don't want to live in ghetto. I want to have people around, be close to the city.  I hate when place is going sleep at 9pm, I want to see people on the streets as much as possible - I'm so tired of LA area, it's so rarely you can see live people around, everyone is driving, even for a few feets.  I would like to have major stores, like Safeway, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, whatever is else of this kind close by.  It'd be great to have a nice parks and rest areas close.  I'm 28, my wife is 25, I would be happy to have young people around. ;) Would you recommend me something?  Do you have an idea of rental property prices?<p>I'm considering Emeryville, the Oakland's part which is close to it, and Berkeley, preferably downtown. I know that some part of Oakland is really bad, I don't want to go there.  I want to keep my family safe.<p>I was also thinking about Walnut Creek area, but it seems to me too far from Silicon Valley, and I think I am going to spend a lot of time there.  Besides, it seems to me too village-styled.<p>I don't know anything about Silicon Valley's places.  I've been in San Jose downtown only (well, it's nice, but looks like to be too far from the city), Mountain View (old good village, sorry), and Palo Alto and Stanford.  I didn't see the downtown.  I heard it's very fun because of a lot of students around, but it's also very expensive, because of Facebook. ;)<p>Are there any LA movers here, who can give their review of the life style comparing to LA?<p>Thanks!",1201113663

For commodities like packaged foods, batteries, household products, electronics, toys, etc that are the same no matter where you buy them, Wal-Mart is 10-20% cheaper than even Target.  The reason more upper income people don't like Wal-Mart is either a) politics or b) many of the older stores are crowded and dirty and it's worth paying a little extra to have a more pleasant experience.  I'm one of the second type, but there's a brand new Wal-Mart near my house that's the nicest big-box store I've ever shopped in, and since there's no ""crowded and dirty tax"" for me to pay, I do most of my shopping there and save some decent money each month.",1201113064

I'd say if you won't settle for the ""default"" choices, you're probably upper class.  If you have to live in Atherton instead of Sunnyvale, you're probably upper class.  If you drive a Lexus instead of a Toyota, you're probably upper class.  If you shop at Whole Foods because the grocery store isn't good enough, you're probably upper class.  If you wouldn't consider a top state school like UVigrinia, the UCs, or UMichigan, because you need to go to an Ivy, you're probably upper class.<p>I was going to say something about Mac vs PC, which outside of hackers might be an indication of upper classism, but remembered that for hackers, the best computer for you is a business expense and a productivity investment.",1201112651

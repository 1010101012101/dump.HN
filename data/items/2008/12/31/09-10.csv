415341,comment,414330,415242,0,0,davidw,,,"One possible solution would be to create a free market system, with some government guarantees for those who are unable to pay themselves.  That has some problems of its own, but it at least attempts to capture the good bits of a free market system, while not leaving the poor to die in the gutters.  Of course, this is more complex than the comment I originally replied to about ""just let some entrepreneur take care of it"".",1230716741

Knowing about someone else's subject experience is a much taller order. So far people seem to learn about it by assuming that others are much like themselves, and then asking them details to get a better picture by successive approximation. It seems we're stuck with examining <i>responses</i> to qualia, at least for now.",1230716238

Are we not entrepreneurs? Are we not engineers? Are we not innovators? If so, then we have truly lost the plot here and slid into trivial political Redditism.<p>Here's a guy who skips college, teaches himself to program, and pioneers the modern video game industry. Though his id partner John Romero rests on his laurels once they become rich and famous, Carmack pushes forward obsessively, almost single-handedly advancing the boundaries of 3D technology with each new game engine release while competing against much larger engineering teams from much larger companies. Then he decides to teach himself rocket science. From this post we learn that he gave up his <i>discretionary spending</i> and became <i>frugal and money conscious</i> again to chase space dreams that <i>bled lots of money</i> and <i>probably wouldn't amount to anything</i>. Now several years later he has a legitimate space company that's doing work for NASA and is poised for real scientific breakthroughs in 2009. Meanwhile, he's still working at id on the next breakthrough 3D game. All the while, never taking investment money, and always giving back his knowledge by sharing highly detailed technical posts like this one (and his old .plan updates)  and by eventually open-sourcing all of his work.<p>This guy is the ultimate hacker. He epitomizes everything that this site is supposed to be about. And you guys are quibbling about the environment? FAIL!",1230715310

This might be true if there was anything to purchase but there isn't. If I start paying myself with wads of Monopoly money I will also have higher income than I have ever had before, it is still monopoly money that doesn't work outside board game.<p>No one is starving in Jamaica and most other countries in the region. (While I have not had the pleasure of living in Cuba, I have lived in Jamaica and Panama and travelled extensively in the region. Both have very high levels of education, health etc.)<p>Cuba was according to 1960 ILO (The International Labour Organization) number 8 world wide for industrial salaries and number 7 for agricultural salaries. While there was not full literacy it had very high rates for the region. Health was also amongst the best in Latin America.

415323,comment,414173,414886,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Without thinking particularly deep about this issue, I suppose your idea runs alongside the efficient market hypothesis. You're making assumptions about the relationship between resource input and product output and perceived value. Like in the EMH, the ideal conditions are perfect information (let's also say perfect money->resource conversion), and rational customers.<p>EMH advocates would say the system is pretty efficient at pricing already; you could argue that the fancier packaging and expensive marketing takes all the markup into account, so when a customer buys, the products are fairly priced, at least in terms of summing up the steps in the value chain. I'm not so sure about that. Tulips, for example.<p>So at the cheap end of the scale I would tend to agree with you. For brand markup though, I still think the same rules don't apply as well. It is plausible that the higher the price, the less exact the correlation between environmental impact. In other words, intuition says that ""environmental cost of a product is almost exactly equal to it's monetary cost"" is less and less applicable as price rises noncompetitively, and brand markup and investor exuberance, are such cases.<p>Oh, I thought of another example. This is just silly: virtual goods. Anyhow your rule of thumb of buying cheap still holds here (the alternative to buying a virtual good is simply not buying, because you have nothing in both cases!). But this is a clear case where you are purchasing a psychological effect. And I would venture a guess that the more psychology you mix into the pricing the less you can infer its environmental cost.<p>Alright, I'm stating the obvious... nitpicking over semantics I guess.",1230714509

The job market is very bad for biologists of all disciplines right now, and computational biology isn't the discipline with the greatest demand.  If you decide to go on, being able to work at the bench is <i>essential</i> to your career.<p>But don't take my word as proof -- the Science Magazine Career forums are literally <i>filled</i> with sad stories of PhDs and post-docs in the biological sciences who can't get jobs.  I wish it had existed when I started my program:<p><a href=""http://scforum.aaas.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scforum.aaas.org/</a><p>(One more thing:  I just read the link to the other comments, and I don't disagree with what they wrote.  Most software jobs suck, too.  But the key insight here is that <i>most jobs suck</i> -- there is no magic bullet to career happiness.  The corollary to that insight is that you need to fail fast; you must <i>quickly</i> work through the things that suck, and find the things that don't.<p>Because a PhD ties you to <i>one</i> thing for so long, it is almost the antithesis of failing fast.  For this reason, I would not recommend a PhD to anyone, unless they <i>explicitly</i> wanted to become a professor, and knew exactly what they were getting themselves into.  It's not the kind of decision that rewards indecisiveness.)",1230714452

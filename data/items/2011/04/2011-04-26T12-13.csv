I believe he said something like ""Well, there's limits with Feynman too"" and I said ""Yeah, he's dead."" So I have to make due with the Feynman Lectures Volume 2, which is excellent but clearly designed for students with a different background in math and physics. (It's still way better than Giancoli.)<p>Ah well, that's often the case in college due to pacing and how it's structured. You do enough to pass the class and if you care you'll go further and reach understanding over the summer.<p>In addition to Feynman's excellent lectures (there are more than the other poster linked) there's also a lot of general videos on the nature of science, what it means to be scientific, and about Feynman himself.

2484939,comment,2483976,2484859,1,0,ignifero,,,"Sorry if i am being dense but you got me confused. 
It makes sense to add 2 rgb vectors from a perceptional standpoint: you add a red color on a green color you get a yellow.  It also makes sense from a physical standpoint:  the resulting frequency spectrum will have peaks near both red and green, thus what we perceive as yellow. If instead you mean that ""red"" is not a physical quantity, i totally agree, it's just a name for a range of frequencies.<p>It seems  to me in computer graphics you also have to deal with other color problems such as light dispersion, the blue shift due to light scattering in the atmosphere, maybe even doppler effects :), but it's still valid to combine colors linearly for short distances, for example a green and yellow lightbulb would look yellow from a reasonably far distance.<p>In the example you give below, RGB 128 can be considered halfway between black and white, just not in terms of frequency, but in terms of freq. distribution (also, RGB is a 3dimensional space). As for the earthquakes, you 're right, the amplitude of the resulting wave would be the product of the original waves. Sorry for the rambling, i think it's a fun subject.",1303822125

Equivalently you can think of them as outlined in Feynman's QED (which anyone interested in physics should read), as arrows. The word ""wave"" shouldn't ever be mentioned in introductory quantum mechanics.<p>Then once that's over, you explain to the students this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7OEzyEfzgg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7OEzyEfzgg</a> it's a duality of interpretation, not reality, we use wave mathematics for simplified calculations. Plus if you interpret it as a wave (as Feynman shows) you run into problems with experimental results not coming out as expected that a particle interpretation doesn't have problems with. (And for some reason I can't think of color in terms of waves, it makes much more sense if I think of it in terms of the energy of a photon with the brightness as a function of how many photons there are, which then ties back to a probability point of view where it's obvious that it's brighter where there's probabilistically more photons.)<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/r5/the_quantum_physics_sequence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/r5/the_quantum_physics_sequence/</a> remains for me the best introduction to thinking sanely about the subject without becoming confused from the get-go as you start talking about waves vs. particles.",1303821531

(2009 they spent 17.4% GDP, or $7960 per person.)<p>Despite spending that money you have an unhealthy population (obesity especially a problem); not many doctors (2.4 per 1000 population, fewer than anywhere else except Japan).<p>Brand name meds are more expensive.  The top 30 drugs are more than twice the price in the US than in the UK.<p>The US does a lousy job of handling long term illness.  Preventable mortality among asthma sufferers between 5 and 39 are high, as are lower limb amputations for diabetics.  (And diabetes is a considerable problem because of the amount of obesity.)<p>People often mention excessive spending in US hospitals - lots of high tech equipment, good doctors, many tests, etc.  US hospitals are more expensive than many other countries.  US doctors get paid more than non-US colleagues (but this is the same for other high-paid workers in different industries.)  US hospitals are more expensive even though the stays are shorter.  What do you get for this money?<p>The US does do a good job with some cancers - survival rates for breast cancer are very good.  Expensive hospitals don't seem to be working in other areas - people with heart attacks are more than twice as likely to have bypass surgery or angioplasty if they're in the US than in Canada; but there's little evidence that US patients live longer.  And some cancers (cervical) have poor outcomes in the US compared to other countries.<p>Of course, collecting the money that people have to pay also costs money.  The US has a high number of admin workers (2.2 per office based doctor).  Collecting revenue was estimated to cost 12% of revenue by one doctor group.<p>The US spends 50% more per person than the next highest spending countries, and more than double of most countries.",1338104961
4029581,comment,4029460,4029460,1,0,lukeck,,,"Very few, if any people can keep every detail of a system as complex as a modern piece of software in their head at once. As developers we just have to accept that. Understanding the big picture, and how all the parts of a picture fit together is still important so rather than trying to load everything into our brains at once, we can focus on a part at a time and develop a good test suite that will point out the effects of any changes so you don't have to try to anticipate them and can focus your energy on he problem at hand.<p>Expanding on that, having a good set of automated tests gives you confidence that all the pieces of the system fit together properly. With good tests in place, you can focus on changing a small part of the code without having to understand how it relates to every other part of the project. If the small change affects anywhere else you'll see this in failing tests.<p>If you aren't already, start writing unit and integration tests for your code. It can feel like unnecessary overhead at first but you quickly reach a liberating point where you can lean on the tests to tell you how any changes affect the bigger picture.",1338104870

4029574,comment,4027465,4027465,2,0,idspispopd,,,"I have never really understood why stock photo stores insist on aggressive watermarks. They don't help their business, rather the opposite. The number of people who can get by with a low resolution preview image are going to be private users who are never going to buy the image anyway. (Especially with sites like sxc.hu where you can just get high resolution photography for no cost.)<p>As someone who works with stock photos constantly, I can tell you that clients hate seeing watermarks, they're usually right in the way of the useful part of the image and are often distracting. As a result the art department photoshop them out which is painstaking and a waste of time for a low resolution image that is only going to be used once.<p>I'm pleased that this new watermark is very easy to undo/disguise. Getty seem to understand that stock-pirates are fine with using low-resolution, highly compressed preview images without a license, while their actual customers need images with watermarks that are unobtrusive and easier to sell to the paying-client.<p>The truth is that the image need only a very minor watermark, so the creative can track down the original. Creative agencies aren't stupid and are well versed in the laws that relate to stock images. They don't use random photos they find on the internet, and larger or risk-absolving clients will often require a copy of the license and waiver for the stock imagery.",1338104677

4029571,comment,4028853,4029071,5,0,tferris,,,"I agree, Ruby is slowly going the downward spiral, why:<p>- RoR introduced groundbreaking concepts 7 years ago: strict MVC, a great ORM, migrations, generators and conventions over configuration and all features weren't optional, users were forced to user them. At that time it was good, because web programming was not structured and between a too formal Java and a loose PHP weren't many choices. Rails' success was also Ruby's success.<p>- Nowadays all the concepts RoR brought all learned and adapted by other languages' frameworks, often even better and more modularized. So, RoR is not the only choice anymore.<p>- The landscape has changed, RoR and Ruby are facing strong competition: Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Clojure, Scala, and PHP matured with many frameworks<p>- The configuration hassle with Ruby and Rails you described is daily routine which is time consuming even for advanced Rubiest and <i>the</i> entry barrier for beginners. And it won't get better because the core team changes Ruby and Rails with a pace never seen before and breaking code steadily. This development is agressive and pushing RoR in one direction leaving no other options (SCSS? CoffeeScript?).<p>- Ruby itself as a language is controversialthere are definitely nice properties but it still comes with drawbacks: it's slow, it still changes too often, the syntax is too dense (writing is quick but comprehension and readability is hard), no concurrency or cluster model, ecosystem exists only for Rails; but still it could established itself with Rails and in few other areas.<p>=> Demand for Ruby and RoR will stay high due to many legacy systems and many Rubiest who still earn high day rates and won't leave due to high opportunity costs if they learned new languages. But newcomers will choose less and less Ruby.",1338104642

I'm not going to say that projects like Hive or Pig should be integrated, because these things are too far from the core philosophy of Hadoop. Iterative map-reduce is a featureset one would <i>expect</i> from a map-reduce library. Twister has iterative map-reduce for years.<p>If Spark gets <i>anywhere</i> near 30x the performance of Hadoop when it comes to iteartive map-reduce, that should raise serious questions: questions like, ""What makes Spark so successful?"" and, ""Can we integrate Spark into the core library?"" There is a need for iterative Hadoop that Spark addresses, and I would also consider it to be major enough to deserve inclusion in the core library. I realize that it is a Scala library, so this could take a lot of time. Even so, I would <i>really</i> want to catch up with that 30x speedup.

(Lots of comparisons to Amazon's dominant position, indeed it does appear that the iBookStore is aimed at disrupting Amazon's stranglehold.) Which is not unusual, since competition would lead to Apple's gain.<p>However what is clear is that Apple do have something to answer for, albeit a far less serious offence rather than Anti-trust/collusion.<p>I suspect this came about so quickly as a result of Amazon lobbyists, rather than a legitimate concern of the government against Apple and the eBook market for the benefit of consumers. I'm of this thinking because the government is typically slow to act and rarely do so preemptive as they have done here. (That and Amazon owning nearly the entire eBook market, stands the most to lose.)<p>Note, lobbying does not imply that Amazon forced the government, rather they could have simply alerted them to the situation.<p>As for throwing publishers under the bus, that's a claim that lacks understanding of what a reply should entail.

I remember reaching a point in those projects where the complexity had reached a level that my brain sort of ""gave up"" and I found I couldn't progress on them anymore. I think I was living under that fallacy that I had to understand the whole project at any given time.<p>Fast forward many years and many shipped products and I certainly don't feel that way. In the broadest sense I think I've learned to embrace ignorance in software development. Developing reusable code is a formalization of that. If you're writing software to be reusable and easy to use (not easy to understand internally) you <i>don't have to</i> have a sense of the big picture, or the whole picture.<p>If it is the case that you're new to programming, I would suggest limited scope as much as possible. The ""simplest"" project is always more complicated than you (or I) would imagine. Try creating a very, very small project but take that project to completion.<p>Alternatively, if you're hitting the complexity wall with what sounds like it could be a fairly straightforward web project, you're probably not leveraging the available tools as much as you should be. If you think that applies pick up a book on RoR or Django, download either of those, and try to build your project (or a simpler version of it) with those tools.<p>You should also consider picking up a book or two on programming best practices. The problem you're attacking with your software may be unique, but writing big (and small) software projects is a solved problem. There's lots of good advice out there on how to structure a big project, how to write reusable code, how to do basic testing, etc -- all of the techniques people have figured out for making large projects manageable.",1338102353

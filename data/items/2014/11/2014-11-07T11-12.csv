I don&#x27;t see state A and their military on one side, and state B with their military on the other, and war profiteers somewhere else -- I see state A and B, their militaries and all war profiteers on one side, and civilians, the people who both get to die and pay for the stuff, on the other. E.g. the elites in China and the US have more in common with each other than with the populations they screw over, and those populations have more in common with each other than with their own so-called leaders.<p>Also, if a military is only useful to defend against other militaries, and that is the actual reason it exists, how did the first military organization come into existence? They had nothing to defend against, so maybe they just made something up? Oh look, the moon is so very round today, we need to attack the neighbouring tribe before they kill us all... I think it&#x27;s perfectly possible that war has <i>always</i> been a racket, and that Stockholm Syndrome and nothing else keeps it going.",1415361587

8572098,comment,8571837,8572026,0,0,lmm,,,"Perl was, in its day, a breath of fresh air. It had an emphasis on practicality that made easy things very easy: regex literals, default arguments like $_, minimal syntax overhead, with things that would be syntax in other languages hoisted to interpreter args (-e, that arg that means &quot;run this as an awk-style loop&quot;), and so on. More than that, the project worked as a holistic ecosystem, rather than just a language and some tools: these days every language has something like CPAN, but it was a huge innovation at the time. Perl also pioneered a lot of the unit-testing infrastructure that we take for granted these days; every project in CPAN was expected to have tests, using the same libraries, and they ran as part of the install process. A cynic might say that perl innovated here out of necessity; lacking static typing and not having VM isolation means good unit tests are a necessity. But still, the resulting infrastructure is very good, and some very solid programs are written in perl. In many ways I&#x27;d say it was the go of its day.<p>The downside of the emphasis on practicality was that the language always suffered from incoherence; with no principled foundation it&#x27;s been slow to adapt as the practical things users want to do change (e.g. I&#x27;d argue string manipulation is a lot less important than it used to be - if you were writing perl today, you might give json manipulation the same prominence as regexes). Perl 6 may have been an effort to fix this, but went too far in the opposite direction; overly formalized, with a premature separation between VM and language that massively slowed development.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of good stuff about modern perl - Moose and the like - but IMO it&#x27;s too little, too late; other languages have been able to improve their infrastructure to (mostly) match perl for easy things. Meanwhile perl&#x27;s incoherence makes it very hard to write large programs and solve hard problems, where languages with a firmer theoretical foundation and stronger stylistic principles have a huge advantage.",1415361267

And so on.<p>> you don&#x27;t need to worry unless you&#x27;re an international terrorist.<p>Or a person with a conscience who could be threat to people in power without one. For some reason I doubt that, say, people involved in extra-judicial killings, are <i>really</i> worried about being caught. At least one of them is known by name and proud holder of a peace nobel prize. So I&#x27;d say if you are a heavyweight criminal already on the payroll, you have nothing to fear period. Small fish and decent people, on the other hand, well. Do you think people like Poitras or Appelbaum don&#x27;t get snooped on? Would you call them international terrorists?

Last time I had a TV was in the 90s. So maybe actually do go on?<p>And even if none of that was true, I don&#x27;t see how it constitutes an argument; as I said, it&#x27;s a bit like saying I shouldn&#x27;t worry about the poison I just ate because I also have cancer. How about I worry about, and try to undo, both?

This is my anecdotal evidence, yes, but I hear about it from others all the time too. People love it because usually they are the first pair of cans they hear which are more expensive than 20 Dollars. Yes, they are way better than the crappy IEMs people used buy just because of their color. This doesn&#x27;t mean that people love &quot;muddy, exaggerated bass&quot;.<p>People love going to concerts too and muddy, exaggerated treble and bass is all you get there in terms of sound. People still go to concerts because of the experience. I love it too. If the same group was having a concert in a much more acoustic concert hall with also the same great experience for even less money, I would definitely prefer that instead. This situation is like, they go to a concert the first time in their life and love it. Does it mean the extremely distorted sound in a crappy concert hall is their preference? I don&#x27;t think so. The crappy concert hall just invested more on marketing so everybody knows about it.<p>So, again, what&#x27;s wrong with some people talking about the disadvantages and pointing that there are better alternatives? Even, in the end, if someone still happens to love the &quot;muddy, exaggerated bass&quot;, at least now they now it&#x27;s not the only option.<p>Coming back to my argument, I&#x27;m 100% confident the phrase &quot;beats revolutionizing the headphones&quot; has less to do with revolution and more to do with marketing (and nothing to do with the technicalities).",1415360321

It is relatively bandwidth efficient (although could be much better), robust with respect to connection issues, and generally works.<p>However, it is less efficient than it could be: if directories have a lot of files, like /var/log often does, there&#x27;s a lot of sync overhead. The delay is 1 minute instead of a couple of seconds (which is what you would get with a simple &quot;tail -f&quot; through a TCP connection), and it doesn&#x27;t play well with common log rotation schemes (though that&#x27;s relatively easy to work around).<p>Anyone has a better solution, kafkaesque or otherwise?",1415360212

(if you want to use BrowserStack for open source, message me and you can use it for free).<p>One of the problems we face when hiring is find “problem solvers”. Here are a few of the problems we worked on reasonably recently, to give you an idea:<p>1. Android Emulators take a lot of time to load. Its a known thing, and it got better in recent releases, but we support many old versions, and our problem was to make it faster. One of the solutions we came up with was to restore from snapshot instead of booting afresh. A lot of ancillary problems arose, like how to open a given URL in the emulator that boots from scratch, and adb was not an option, as it takes a lot of time for it to register there.<p>2. One of features we release recently, we call “AutoFit”, where in when you resize your browser running on your laptop, we resize the remote browser. Issuing a simple window resize was initial idea, but then there was problem when new window, alerts or context menus not coming in right place.<p>3. Mobile Screenshots Problem: we needed to be able to take upto 10 screenshots per second and upload them to S3, from an app that is running in background. There were many problems here, like making sure files get uploaded as fast as possible without effecting normal network usage on mobile. Or taking the screenshots themselves from an app running in background in iOS.<p>Along with these problems, some of which we have already solved, we have usual “standard problems” like writing well tested, scalable software systems, dealing with all sorts of attacks on all sorts of different VMs we support, making a kick ass UI, loads of specialised system services, applications we distribute to our customers and so on.<p>So how to go about it?",1415360056

Instead one should try to understand design-decisions and how they fit together - the subtleties. Devil is in the details.<p>For example, having an <i>receive</i> expression and pattern-matching and simple typing (like everything is a <i>term</i> - self-evaluating or an expression or a <i>list of terms</i>) makes your code shorter, self-evident, easy testable.<p>Now let&#x27;s look one level down. Pattern-matching on binary data (alternative to costly parsing) is so quick that in OTP they do matching on TCP packets in real-time.<p>Conversion from terms to binary and back is also quick. So  the the &quot;central idiom&quot; - message-passing - is just sending and receiving a list of terms (atoms) on a <i>language-level</i> (guarded pattern-matching, like on function arguments) while messages will be encoded into efficient binary form and delivered by Erlang&#x27;s runtime.<p>Again, almost everything in Erlang fits together pretty well because it is layered system founded on proper principles and design decisions. Immutable data, share-nothing process isolation, light-weight processes, common and simple data-representation format based on simple types, pattern-matching on everything, etc.<p>It is almost like industry-strength Lisp system - a few layers of DSLs, using which one describes the real-world abstractions on different levels on different sub-languages (based on special forms and function composition).<p><i>gen_server</i> is the most common example of such kind of &quot;vertical&quot; decomposition. You have to write only &quot;pattern-matching on receive&quot;, while lower layers of abstraction (encoding, protocols) and upper levels (process supervision) are clearly separated with proper abstraction barriers.<p>Of course, it is possible to code something like this in Java, but there are the subtleties. GC for mutable data could not be as efficient as one for immutable data. No mutable state, no sharing, no locking, no problem. These aren&#x27;t just slogans.<p>So, Erlang is a <i>small language</i> designed around proper concepts. It &quot;wins&quot; not only in terms of lines of code, but in efficiency, resource usage (Erlang runs on 16Mb RAM).<p>I could go on, but I hope the idea is already clear. It is not a &quot;list of features&quot; what matters, but which ones we have and especially don&#x27;t have, and how they are fit together. In small mostly-functional languages like Lisps or Erlang or ML-family they fit perfectly.<p><a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html</a>",1415359877

When people realized that this separation alone was not enough of a guarantee, they split it further (roughly along Montesquieu&#x27;s lines) exactly so that nobody could inflict its own personal moral code on the whole of the community <i>without the community agreeing first</i>. When the community changes its stance (because of moral or technical changes or whatever), then <i>it collectively agrees</i> that laws should change, and new law supersedes old law.

8571998,comment,8571134,8571590,0,0,dnautics,,,"I can give a hypothetical reason why specifically might not work (disclaimer: my PhD thesis is in this field).  In most Type I diabetics, the autoantigen (as in the protein that is the target of immune attack) is this peptide called amylin.  This peptide is a generally problematic peptide - it&#x27;s metastable - and in Type II diabetics it forms plaques.  Interestingly, mice and rats have amylin, but unlike most other mammals, it&#x27;s not metastable[0].  I would not be surprised if in NOD (non-obese-diabetic) mice it&#x27;s NOT the autoantigen.<p>Based on different protein targetting, the mechanism of beta-cell killing in NOD mice might not have exactly the same autoimmune interactions, and a rejuvenation strategy might not work in humans quite the same way.<p>It&#x27;s not entirely clear to me when they plan on doing therapeutic intervention for children with Type I diabetes; by the time first symptoms show up it may be too late (unlike the mice where they knew when/that it would happen).<p>Finally, it&#x27;s a bit odd to me that they didn&#x27;t look through health records of existing type I diabetes patients that have been incidentally prescribed Verapamil.  There should be some usable data that hints at the possible usefulness of this strategy, unless the patients were treated for hypertension much later in life than getting diabetes (very likely), aka too late to do anything about it.<p>[0]mice and rats are weird, they also have two copies of the insulin gene.  One of the copies has an amino acid that is absolutely conserved across all vertebrates substituted for a substantially different one.<p>[1] bonus: rats also don&#x27;t have gall bladders.<p>[2] bonus 2:  While I was working on diabetes model systems in the lab, we had lots of verapamil floating around, because my boss had this crazy idea that verapimil would fix a whole category of diseases (calcium homeostasis is important for protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum).",1415358847

8571961,comment,8571125,8571866,0,0,jperkin,,,"Briefly:<p>* Between Solaris 10 and Solaris 11, Oracle bought Sun and killed the open source efforts known as OpenSolaris.  illumos started from the final open source bits of what eventually became Solaris 11 and has now significantly diverged.  Solaris is effectively dead, illumos is very much alive.<p>* There are a number of illumos &quot;forks&quot;, of which SmartOS is ours, but all forks still share the common illumos code (we merge daily) and contribute heavily back to the common base.  Each fork may contain features which aren&#x27;t yet ready for merging back, e.g. our work to port KVM[1] to SmartOS is not part of illumos yet, but other distributions such as OmniOS[2] have taken that work and integrated it.<p>* SmartOS is a minimal distribution, we have removed a lot of parts (desktop, shared storage, etc.) which do not fit in with our explicit design goals, and added tooling around virtualisation.  You boot from USB/CD/PXE into a minimal live-image hypervisor known as the Global Zone[3], and then perform work in zones which are backed by local storage.  To upgrade, you simply replace the USB image with a newer platform and reboot into the new live image.<p>* As for software, we provide userland built from pkgsrc[4], which gives you access to over 13,000 packages available under /opt/local, allowing you to use both the SmartOS tools as well as any third party software you may need (e.g. GNU stuff).  There is even full desktop stuff provided, should you want to use it[5].<p>* In Manta, when running a job you are basically running in a zone with as many pkgsrc packages pre-installed as we can manage (currently nearly 9,000), so the chances are that the software you need is available.  If not, you can easily build it yourself and the store it back in Manta to use later as an asset[6] for your jobs.<p>* There is definitely a free tier for Joyent zones (search for &quot;free&quot; on <a href=""https://www.joyent.com/products/public-cloud/pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.joyent.com/products/public-cloud/pricing</a>), I thought there was also an additional free tier for Manta but I can&#x27;t see it right now, however it will only cost a few cents to do some basic tests in Manta and get a feel for what it can do.<p>I primarily work on pkgsrc, but I know a number of other engineers will be reading this thread and can comment in more depth on SDC/Manta, so feel free to ask any more questions or pop onto #smartos or #manta on Freenode IRC.<p>Thanks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2011/08/15/kvm-on-illumos/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2011/08/15/kvm-on-illumos/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://omnios.omniti.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omnios.omniti.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.perkin.org.uk/posts/smartos-and-the-global-zone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perkin.org.uk/posts/smartos-and-the-global-zone.h...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://pkgsrc.joyent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pkgsrc.joyent.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://twitter.com/jperkin/status/348506063336783872"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/jperkin/status/348506063336783872</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/jobs-reference.html#assets-assets-property"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apidocs.joyent.com/manta/jobs-reference.html#assets-...</a>",1415358056

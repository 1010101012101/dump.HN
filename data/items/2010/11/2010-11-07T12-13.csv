No idea where it is.  Amazon will end up refunding my money (for the 3rd time) and HDNL will take a loss (for the 3rd time).  I work from home, nobody ever rang my bell or put a missed delivery card through my slot.  FWIW I have no mysterious address and am easy to find.  I work from home and am always available to collect my deliveries.  HDNL has successfully delivered 3 out of 6 orders since March 2010.  Related - Royal Mail doesn't even bother to ring my bell, so I need to hike up to the sorting office 4 miles away by taxi.  Looking for a way to vent I found this: http://www.reviewcentre.com/reviews-all-150787.html
</rant><p>Punchline:  I am tired of this nonsense.  Does anyone know of any startups who could finally provide a reliable parcel delivery service in the UK?  I'm no supply chain engineer but I am thinking something like ubercab for parcel delivery.<p>If anyone can recommend an alternate and reliable service, please do! Also feel free to vent your similar experiences :)",1289134762

You know I used to get funny looks from my philosophy classmates when I answered their question, ""so what's your other subject?"" (you take two subjects at degree level where I'm from). Nearly everybody combines philosophy and literature or philosophy and sociology or philosophy psychology, you get the idea. But math? What has philosophy go to do with math? I dunno, ask Bertrand Russel. Ask Frege. Ask Descartes. Ask Leibniz. :) And then I'd tell them that I used to work in IT as a software tester and developer and they'd look at me as if I had two heads. In some parts of the world this is considered a lot stranger than other parts. In Spain (where I've had the good fortune to have lived) people think you are _really strange_ if you study one discipline and work at something else. You get less funny looks in northern Europe.<p>I wonder what your PhD program is? I'm pursuing a Master (in Digital Culture as I mentioned elsewhere here) at the moment. For my thesis I'm combining my love of IT and math and philosophy by researching open source (free software I mean) mathematical tools. Like Richard Stallman I see free software as an ethical issue, which is how I rope philosophy into it :) For my Bachelor's degree I wrote a paper on the philosophy of the infinitesimal calculus and intuitionism! So I always manage to draw together the various intellectual pieces that make up the puzzle of ... whatever the puzzle is. Right now what gets me very excited is intuitionistic type theory and the Curry-Howard correspondence because again this area of logic/epistemology can be looked at through comp-sci glasses, philosophical glasses and mathematical glasses.<p>I realize all this is totally unrelated to my original question - apologies to all for that but it's not everyday one meets one's clone in cyberspace.",1289133374

In your app you then check if that cookie exists, and if it does look up the user id and log them in automatically.<p>The other way to do it is to use the existing session support. If the 'remember me' box is checked, you change the session so that instead of it expiring at the end of the browser session, it expires way into the future.<p>ie. your login script probably looks like this:<p><pre><code>  session_start();
  $username = filter_func($_POST['username']);
  $password = filter_func($_POST['password']);
  $user = $db->query('select userid from users where username = ? and password = ?', $username, $password);
  if($user) {
    //user is logged in
    $_SESSION['loggedin'] = true;
  } else {
    // show login page with error
  }

you need to change it to:<p><pre><code>  $username = filter_func($_POST['username']);
  $password = filter_func($_POST['password']);
  $remember = (bool) $_POST['rememberme'];
  $user = $db->query('select userid from users where username = ? and password = ?', $username, $password);
  if($user) {
    //user is logged in
    if($remember) {
      $lifetime = 10 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60;
      session_set_cookie_params(time() + $lifetime);
    }
    session_start();
    $_SESSION['loggedin'] = true;
  } else {
    // show login page with error
  }
</code></pre>
the key function is session_set_cookie_params() which will let you alter the cookie that the session store uses prior to seeting it:<p><a href=""http://php.net/session_set_cookie_params"" rel=""nofollow"">http://php.net/session_set_cookie_params</a><p>note: that you need to call it before you call session_start(). $lifetime just calculates the number of seconds in 10 years, and the time set is time() (ie. now) plus the number of seconds in 10 years.<p>note: filter_func is a function that you write that will filter input variables, and $db is whatever your db class or access method is.<p>note: you also need to filter $_SESSION. most devs have a class that they wrap $_SESSION in rather than using it directly.",1289132998

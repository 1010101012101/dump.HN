Everybody is free to think and act as they please.  So if this means combatting ""fluff"", then by all means do that.<p>On the other hand, I will always be speaking out for diversity.  I'm sure we can all agree that great ideas don't grow out of homogeneity and that it requires a mix of information from different sources.<p>Fear mentalities are much more dangerous than ""fluff"" because they can seep into other aspects of your life...<p>Btw, can anybody explain to me why I'm being downmodded so much?  I really don't care about the karma itself (except for real-life Karma of course!), but I would like for somebody to explain to me what is wrong with my arguments regarding this emerging ""War On Fluff"" (sorry, I couldn't resist!!).  I will also add that I hope when I ask for feedback on my startup/concept in the coming weeks people are just as sincere about giving me some feedback!<p>;)",1203791509

Apple will probably sell apps through itunes for 4.99 (or less), so you don't have to worry about sales or distribution (and marketing becomes easier too).

I haven't implemented billing yet. This is obviously essential, but now may be premature, since ...
I've got very few users. So, maybe I should do more marketing, but ...
My site may not be good enough yet, so most visitors won't stay around. So maybe I should listen carefully to my current users and make the site ... prettier? Easier to use? Create more content?

So when I search for 'cappucino book', FB knows I mean the web framework from the context of my discussions with FB/Twitter friends.<p>FB encourages users to make FB their first destination, users do this because it's search and their friends in one place, and why would you want anything else, when, in this scenario, FB's results are always better than Google's anyway?",1257155968

In the Dropbox iPhone app, mark the PDFs as ""favorites,"" and they'll be synced to the iPhone's drive, accessible whether or not the phone is online.<p>There are all the ""network drive"" applications as well, of course, but I think this is the best of both worlds: if you're at home the LAN sync will negate any extra bandwidth usage, while if you're out somewhere you can still pull the file from the network (once) and then keep it stored locally from then on.

916474,comment,916225,916459,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Intrinsics are still worse (performance-wise) than hand-coded assembly, for two reasons.<p>The first reason is the whole category of optimizations that the compiler is worse than a human at (like register allocation) or cannot do effectively at all (messing with calling conventions, computed jumps).<p>The second reason is more subtle: in any case that you abstract yourself from some part of a problem, you inherently create a less efficient solution.<p>For example, intrinsics mean that you don't have to manually allocate registers.  But this also means that if your algorithm uses too many registers and it would be more efficient to modify it to require fewer (and thus not need spills), you will have no way of knowing such a thing.  By insulating yourself from that layer of complexity, you've also limited your ability to make higher-level optimizations that improve lower-level performance.<p>This applies on practically every level possible: any method of abstraction, no matter how well designed, will always in some fashion reduce the maximum performance you can achieve.  Of course, this doesn't mean abstraction is bad--it provides an often-useful tradeoff between developer time and performance.",1257153297

Mountain View, however, has some really great ethnic food for cheap, especially on Castro Street.<p>The other thing that people don't really know until they've lived here is that you typically don't have to live in suburban hell so long as you know where the ""main drags"" are. The peninsula / south bay used to be all orchards with ""main streets"". Today there's a ""main street"" in nearly every city that is worth living near -- walking distance, and only a slight premium (University Ave excluded, thanks to Facebook).

194375,comment,194070,194070,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"> Now two new studies by economists and social scientists have reached a perhaps startling conclusion: An important part of the explanation for the gender gap, they are finding, are the preferences of women themselves. When it comes to certain math- and science-related jobs, substantial numbers of women - highly qualified for the work - stay out of those careers because they would simply rather do something else.<p>Am I the only one not startled by this? My reasoning was as follows... I can think of a ton of jobs that are traditionally dominated by females (elementary school teacher, housekeepers, talk-show hosts) that I happen to not want to do. It has nothing to do with me being male or some perceived descrimination against me by the females in the field. I just don't have any interest in being those things.<p>I would assume the same thing holds true for a female and some professions that <i>just happen</i> to be historically dominated by males. I mean, some of the disparity probably is because of gender-based slight, but it seems rational to expect that some jobs just aren't interesting enough to attract people in droves of equal and politically correct gender ratios.<p>> The United States, Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and the United Kingdom, which offer women the most financial stability and legal protections in job choice, have the greatest gender split in careers. In countries with less economic opportunity, like the Philippines, Thailand, and Russia, she writes, the number of women in physics is as high as 30 to 35 percent, versus 5 percent in Canada, Japan, and Germany.<p>My guess is this is because they have the option to choose careers, rather than being forced to accept whatever pays well and is safe.<p>> Benbow and Lubinski, at Vanderbilt, found that high-achieving women often pick their careers based on the idea that they'll eventually take time off, and thus avoid fields in which that absence will exact a larger penalty. In humanities or philosophy, for instance, taking a year or two off won't affect one's skill set very much. But in quickly evolving technical fields, a similar sabbatical can be a huge career setback.<p>I have seen this in talking with my girlfriend about her career goals. She is a chemical engineer, and often fears that taking time off to raise kids will doom her career.",1211226962

Everywhere I looked, my first thought was ""Do not want!""  I would never live in a place like that.<p>Then we got into YC, and I had another look around, and it turns out there are little pockets of nice living on the peninsula.  The downtown Mountain View area is great, as long as piece and quiet are positive attributes for you.  It lacks the suburban sprawl and mini-malls of Sunnyvale and Santa Clara (the Rengstorff/Showers area excepted), and actually has a very walkable central core.  And, I guess in 12 years a lot of good restaurants can happen, as there are at least a dozen good places on Castro and a few good ones sprinkled about in the rest of town (Amber India, for example).  The library is awe-inspiring, the parks are numerous and just crowded enough to be interesting, and there are two little Asian markets within walking distance.  I always see dozens of people walking when I'm out.  There is a patch of soulless hell at the distant end of Castro, where the Starbucks and other polished up corporate turds reside, but one can avoid it easily (just stop and turn around at City Hall).",1211226384

What's the sense in creating the 5000th 3D model of a human? Humans don't change that much. Not even fictional bipeds do. Have you ever heard a game developer or pundit complain about 'spiraling costs' for game development? It's because human developers have more and more work to do to make the games keep track with developments in hardware. It should be obvious to anybody that this development isn't sustainable; there's no way every room of a game designed by humans can have even as much detail as the room I'm sitting in right now. But most of this architecture is predictable, and could probably be generated by the right program.<p>Consider a lower bound of game development costs for this 'generation' of consoles at 3 million dollars. If even five percent of that cost could be eliminated by better development tools, that would mean savings (and potential for profit!) of 150,000 dollars. But the potential savings from automating menial modeling tasks are a <i>lot</i> higher.<p>Seriously. We need software to make stuff like this easier.

In the last 6-7 years before realy quitting I was more or less constantly in the process of quitting. When successful for one years or one and a half, then I would lapse back into the bad habit. And always for almost honorable reasons. Paul's description is quite correct here. Who wanted to blame you for a single cigarette on your graduation party, and the like.<p>It became a bit disheartening, because once you had proven that you would relapse after apparently successfully stopping for so long, you don't believe into yourself any longer. If 18 months was not safe, would it be fair to feel safe after 24 months the next time? Or after 30 months? And in general it was really this continuous argument with yourself all the time. Just one tonight? -- But then I found a trick that worked. My girlfriend (who smoked as well) and me would set up a monetary fine. That simple. And effective. We agreed that whoever smokes a cigarette had to pay 500 euros (which was a lot for us then), no offsetting against each other!<p>Reflecting on this, it is curious that one should be more successful with a bit of cash, when years of your life and your health are at stake. And I was perfectly aware of the health risk back then, of course. I assume that one involuntarily calculates the net present value of your health in the future. I think your really have to beat the economics of quitting, otherwise you out-cheat yourself without end. Take an amount that hurts you. I am a idealistic person, and working with cheap money tricks was not much after my taste. We were making us the equivalent of a donkey tricked around by a carrot.

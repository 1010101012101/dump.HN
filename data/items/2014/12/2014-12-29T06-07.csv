8808800,comment,8806293,8807188,0,0,Camillo,,,"What many people miss about Anselm&#x27;s argument is that it is based on an ontology that essentially identifies existence with goodness. Arguments that attempt to derive existence from extreme badness are obviously wrong under that premise. On top of that, existence would not be considered an attribute of arguments themselves. You have trouble with this point yourself, where you quickly replace it with a notion of &quot;being made&quot;. Speaking of which, existence would not be considered an attribute of acts, either.",1419836351

8808790,comment,8806143,8808602,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It&#x27;s really hard to identify a single work that sums a whole industrial sector. Even my line of work, in film, is hard to sum up - not least because the entertainment industry glamorizes and celebrates success as a part of making its own output desirable, leading to a distorted public perception.<p>Here&#x27;s a few book links that would give you a good overview:

Producers partner with production companies who partner with studios; the production company typically finances the creation of the film and the studio typically finances commercial launch (as well as some internally produced projects). Less popular fare is often sold in advance to international distributors on the strength of the package in order to underwrite the production finance, more popular stuff is sold as a function of its box-office performance.<p>Studios <i>qua</i>publishers do extract rents, but the packaging, production, and launch of a film is a combination of very high-risk financing, very aggressive contractual negotations, and huge logistical problems, and it&#x27;s hyper-meritocratic for all but the very top executives (ie the heads of the studio conglomerates, who are running multibillion corporations doing everything from films to theme parks to action figures to...).<p><i>what I perceive to be a sudden increase of market discipline and pressure for them</i><p>Well let&#x27;s face it, producers of other goods and services don&#x27;t have to deal with zero marginal cost piracy - of course they have a lot of competition but manufacturing or delivering a good or service in most fields has a bunch of minimal physical costs, compared to a perfect digital copy that can be produced for essentially $0.<p>Besides that, they&#x27;re already subject to a great deal of market discipline - the film market is massively, massively competitive. think about it, there are hundreds of new products launched every year and they&#x27;re largely judged on the first few weeks of their sales performance. Take a look at this: <a href=""http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?page=1&view=releasedate&view2=domestic&yr=2012&p=.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?page=1&view=releaseda...</a><p>Out of 665 films released in 2012 you&#x27;ll recognize most of the top 100 from seeing them advertised, maybe 10 or 20 of the second 200, and virtually none of the other 465. A few make megabucks, the top 100 all make at least $25 million (so more likely than not they broke even or better), but outside the top 200 very few make even $1 million (that&#x27;s revenue, not profit). I mention this price point because $1m is about the minimum production budget to get a theatrical release in the first place. If your film cost less than that then it&#x27;s not happening without very hefty amounts of both talent and luck. About half of films don&#x27;t even break $100,000 in revenue; the theatrical release is to make them eligible for award nominations and establish a minimum quality threshold to attract the attention of a secondary (video, streaming, maybe TV) market distributor.<p>Most films, like 80% or more, lose money. It&#x27;s not necessarily because they&#x27;re crap (although many of them are), but often they have limited or specialist appeal. Most  distribution deals are for packages of films, in which the revenue from a marketable film outweighs the inevitable losses made by other films in the package, but helps to recoup their production costs. Yes, this is a drag on the economic performance of the more marketable films, but everyone accepts it because if every film had to be sold on its individual merits most would never succeed and fr fewer films would get made, which would significantly raise the barriers to entry (already quite high) and significantly reduce the stream of incoming new talent.<p>It&#x27;s a much more complex ecosystem than it might appear from the outside, and much more driven by love of the product that might at first be apparent. To characterize the industry by the negative aspects of big players like Disney, sony etc. is like saying retail is bad because you dislike Walmart or Amazon, or software is bad because you don&#x27;t like Microsoft or Electronic Arts.",1419835784

The more mature the economy, the lower the perceived risk (on average), and so the lower the rates.  Apparently in the later stages of the Roman Empire for instance, interest rates were very low.  So it isn&#x27;t a foregone conclusion that interest rates will ever return to the &quot;normal&quot; levels of the 20th century, at least until a new global paradigm comes along.

fair enough, i see we are saying the same thing here. tbh i just read your sentence as gibberish to impress how much you knew about economics. i understand the meaning if not the terminology, no need to be an arse.<p>&quot;Well, now you know how I feel..&quot;
to be fair, i knew how you felt. i was just trying to disabuse you of the notion that there is anything fair about work and pay. it is power pure and simple. that is, in fact, why some people get the 10x income, and some do the 1x work.<p>&quot;In what sense do you consider yourself a producer?&quot;
i am sorry, but i cannot help but read that as being a bit fucking condescending. so finding it difficult, but giving you the benefit of doubt, perhaps you are asking if i am a big p Producer? no. i am a designer. 1 x work for slightly less than 1x pay.. as it happens.",1419833997

If we allow an exact 50% share to count as a “majority” then both nodes can potentially continue to accept and acknowledge updates during the division, because each is capable of updating a majority of the nodes in the cluster (in this case, just itself, but the same argument applies if we have larger numbers of nodes in each half). However, when the division is healed, a simple check to see which leader node has the higher term count and allow its log to take precedence is no longer sufficient.<p>The problem is that we have violated the State Machine Safety guarantee described in the Raft paper (that is, we can have different nodes that have different committed entries at the same index in their respective logs). We now have no way to resolve the conflict, because those updates were already committed by some of the nodes in the cluster and have been acknowledged by their respective leader nodes, so now we can’t just append any extra committed log entries from one node to another node’s log to get back to a consistent state.",1419833602

This is because we do know that the NSA infiltrates domestic technical groups as they did with the IETF to affect standards discussions, that they infiltrate activist groups inside the United States to disrupt them, that they are aware of social contagion theory and its usefulness in affecting public opinion, that they have done studies with at least the UCLA on viral messaging for Americans (to compare to, with and against foreign countries), that political campaigns use social targeting techniques without branding and will comment on news articles (to be &#x27;first to post&#x27;) to color conversation on hot button issues during the races, and that companies with political interests and who share a revolving door with elected office also advertise political discourse online in this way. Thinkst researchers studied how easy it is to manipulate online social conversation, news media outlets and platforms. We know that the GCHQ have JTRIG capabilities to perform internet manipulation and that there are documents from Snowden that specifically mention their use in derailing conversations on online forums.

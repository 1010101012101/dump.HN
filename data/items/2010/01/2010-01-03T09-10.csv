I'm usually a buyer so I'll tell you about my experiences as a buyer:<p>I've been working with numerous freelancers for quite a while. It took me a long time to figure out how to choose my freelancers and I've had several failures along the way. The first things I outsourced were website PSD to HTML conversion (""slicing"") and php scripts. These projects were usually somewhere between 50$ and 200$. While I did check their references and their ratings, I always tried to take one the cheapest providers. The projects grew and my average project size currently is 1000$, with the smallest ones still 100$ and the bigger ones 15k USD. I have changed my criteria since then and now look for the following things:<p>1. If you need a special skill (i.e. I once had a project that involved a lot of work with the google maps api): I most often search these sites my self and usually invite only the people that actually have that skill mentioned on their profile page. That way you can be sure that they actually know what they're doing and that they don't have to learn it while working for you.<p>2. Average hourly wage & price is the most reliable predictor about the quality. Usually providers will try to be as cheap as possible, providers who have enough work and who are confident enough that their work is really valuable however won't play this game and usually charge more per hour. I usually pick developers who charge more than the average.<p>3. It may look like you'll get a great deal but most of the time you won't. If someone is bidding 200$ on a project that even a non techie like you can say that the project won't be just a 3hour job but weeks of work, then don't pick this bidder. Most of the developers quickly loose their motivation to do anything after they have exceeded their own budget for this project, start to do sloppy work, or argue about not implementing required features.<p>4. Don't trust the ratings. There are some providers that go out of their way to get good ratings even after they screwed up big time. I've had people begging me not to give them bad ratings even offering me a refund. When looking at their ratings the valuable information is usually in the buyers comments not in the 5-star ""grades""<p>5. Always check the code they're writing. I've had freelancers who screwed up you couldn't even imagine. Like putting and SQL query into a GET variable and then execute it on the server unfiltered.<p>This is when buying from one of these sites. By now I more or less figured it out but especially in the beginning I burnt my fingers quite a few times when working with freelancers. It's something that takes time to master.<p>I agree with ankeshk, I've had the best experience with odesk because their workforce is better qualified and the hourly billing is ok for me. I also oftentimes use elance for some projects.<p>Another helpful tip: I was working on a project where I needed a twisted proxy to translate something for me. I started reading the documentation of twisted and after a few minutes I decided that I'll try my luck in their IRC chat. I went in there and basically just said: I need some help with twisted, would anyone be interested in a small half day project and earn a few bucks? and worked with the first guy to answer in the chat. It worked out quite well.<p>I've also hired people from djangogigs.com and it worked out ok however you have to watch out that these people really are freelancers that want to do freelancing, I've worked with a few who said after a couple of weeks that they couldn't do it after all because they don't have enough time after their normal workday to do freelancing.<p>There are outsourcing companies like Itteco.com and x-minds.org which I can really recommend for bigger projects and longer lasting partnerships. I have worked with both of them, I don't know all of their developers but they certainly have good developers. If you decide to work with a bigger company I would usually only do that with a personal introduction and/or careful due diligence.<p>Generally speaking: if you're looking for freelancers, ask people in your network, if they know good freelancers that's the best way to find them.",1262512789

It's much cheaper because:<p>- he didn't have to spend 200k to go to med school, it's free<p>- he doesn't need 5 employees to fill insurance forms, or waste 2h a day calling insurers -- it's all automagic, no paper involved.",1262512610

Once you establish a reputation, its upto you to pick up projects that are interesting and there are many prototype projects. Gives you an opportunity to try out new technologies that you may never do otherwise.<p>But as I get more experience on the site, I stopped bidding for low bid projects as the back and forth between buyer and seller takes a lot of time (for e.g. some sellers expect that you do a prototype before accepting the bid) and it does not work out for the amount bid for.<p>As for payment, Ive never had an issue with RentaCoder, Ive tried both snail mail and PayPal and they both have been fantastic.<p>My experience has been this: I only work for 2 or 3 clients now on Rentacoder because that takes all the time I have.

In fact, I really have not changed my feeding habits <i>at all</i> since coming to the USA.<p>Yes, unhealthy dietary choices weighs the system down - but it weighs <i>all</i> systems down, and to say it accounts for the majority of the discrepancy is IMHO missing the gorilla in the room, which is that the US health care system is unbelievably broken.<p>Addendum: There is <i>one</i> thing where the US is very different from Canada. You guys eat the same stuff we do... but you eat <i>much more</i> of it. I'm pretty convinced that the average American can eat <i>half</i>, if not <i>one quarter</i> what they currently do and be just fine.

1028384,comment,1028314,1028370,0,0,cwan,,,"One additional note that I'd also make is that intercompany shareholdings (keiretsu used to promote stability and prevent takeovers) were in essence financed by the government and in turn made the mess even more difficult to ultimately deal with given the incestuous crossholdings and restructure firms.<p>I agree with you on the obstacles facing China to becoming a superpower which are far greater than others imagine.  Working there, you see how inefficiently resource allocation has been for state owned enterprises which in turn have propped up stock prices and real estate.  How they're able to deal with any bust politically is what scares me.<p>The government is already largely hated/strongly disliked in many quarters (there are many who have long memories not to mention the obvious and very visible corruption).  It bears mention that that China liberalized not because they wanted to, but because they had no choice given how poor their people were.  When the bust happens, the increased civil unrest and the government's overriding resolve to maintain power will be a volatile combination - one that Japan didn't have to deal with.<p>I also agree that the parallel of Japan seems more relevant to China than the US.  China's non performing assets in their banking sector has likely grown quite significantly with the push for lending in the last year.  The average Chinese aren't stupid either - which makes it a potential catastrophe if certain world leaders get their wish that the RMB is allowed to float.  Capital will rush out of China and its domestic banks causing a financial crisis and ironically potentially a RMB that is worth substantially less than it is today.",1262510794

You'll usually get something usable, but it often won't be exemplary code.<p>If ""usually get something usable"" sounds scary, see point #3.<p>5) Don't expect to save yourself time. Instead you spend the same amount of time as you would have spent <i>had you already known how to do what needed to be done</i> but you instead spend the time on communication, and you get your job done by someone who knows how to do it.<p>A corollary to #5 is for some small jobs, you might be able to learn how to do the task and then do it yourself, all in the same amount of time you spent directing the freelancer.<p>So why do it at all? Because of #6:<p>6) Using such a service can move an item off your to-do list, because having a person at the other end of a job bid (and having your reputation on the site as a buyer on the line) you get forced to finish the item. So effectively it's an anti-procrastination tool.<p>This is my experience, which is biased toward small jobs. But then, I wouldn't use one of these sites for a big job.",1262509581

1028373,comment,1028314,1028359,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Keynes would agree with you...in the General Theory, his argument was that the ""natural"" state of the economy was a liquidity trap.  Rising productivity results in an increase in aggregate supply, which results in persistent deflation, which encourages people to hold money instead of investing it, which results in a cap on that productivity.<p>IIRC, he even suggested that Europe's long period of stagnation during the Dark Ages was because real interest rates were so high that rational entrepreneurs would never invest in new technology, because there was no conceivable way that they could generate a positive return on capital.  And that the pyramids were ancient Egypt's solution to the problem of Keynesian stimulus (i.e. nobody was investing, so they built the pyramids to forcibly confiscate money through taxes and then distribute it to workers who would actually spend it).<p>It makes me wonder what we're in for over the next 10 years.  I don't really believe the ""permanently stuck in a deflationary trap"" theory - there's too much evidence against it.  But I think the normal way countries get out of it is through war, which isn't terribly rosy either.  In addition to the direct Keynesian stimulus, it also encourages rapid technological development, which opens up new markets that then become fertile ground for investment after the war.",1262509214

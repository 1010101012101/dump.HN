In classical economics, immigrations is (1) good for the immigrant (2) bad for the local workers they are competing with and (3) good for the employers.   According to classical economics, the net benefit is positive, and so (with appropriate taxation policy) the overall result is good for the nation.<p>Personally I am orthodox when it comes to economics.  The only thing I don&#x27;t understand is that the liberals apply orthodox economic arguments when it comes to Mexican immigrants, but refuse to apply these same arguments when it comes to H-1B visas.<p>To me it is clear that their real agenda is to promote non-White immigration, but to keep sentiment against Indian and Chinese immigrants as a safe way to express &quot;racist&quot; thoughts.",1424587861

I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re probably already aware of this, but those who are browsing the comments might not. The man was a genius.<p>For instance:<p>.50 BMG = Browning Machine Gun; the round and the M2 machine gun.<p>The Browning Hi-Power.<p>The .380 auto is sometimes referred to as the 9mm Browning. Probably obvious why...<p>Heck, I should just stop listing these off, because there&#x27;s way too many things JMB took part in. I&#x27;ll leave this [1] link instead. It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that you could <i>probably</i> credit Browning indirectly for a number of other designs currently in use that either borrow directly from his work or are inspired by it, including most modern automatic pistols (yes, even Glock).<p>> I like 1911 style guns and my next gun will probably be such a model.<p>I&#x27;d definitely suggest it. Sure, it&#x27;s not as &quot;elegant&quot; as some of the polymer frames out there these days, but it&#x27;s still a workhorse. There&#x27;s something about the older designs that are remarkable feats of engineering for their day, to say nothing of the incredible history behind them that seems attractive to be a small part of by way of ownership.<p>That said, owning both a 1911 and a Glock, I&#x27;ll admit that I can&#x27;t really pin a favorite. I like both for different reasons. While I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another 1911 (I won&#x27;t rule out a conversion kit, though...) since I have my eyes on other Glock models (and possibly another brand of polymer), it&#x27;s a design that&#x27;s almost timeless. Mine&#x27;s an SR1911 (model 6700) with rosewood grips, and it&#x27;s <i>sexy</i>. But loads of other manufacturers are making some <i>great</i> looking 1911s at all different price points.

I wouldn&#x27;t spend a lot of time thinking about if it was notable or not.  Just go to Github, look for popular projects, perhaps in a language you might know somewhat like C# ( <a href=""https://github.com/trending?l=csharp&since=monthly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/trending?l=csharp&since=monthly</a> ), browse the project issues page and pull requests and see if the maintainer(s) apply patches in a timely manner (since you&#x27;re a junior, timely can extend to within a few months).<p>Find a project that seems interesting, and an issue you think you might be able to handle, and try to fix the issue.  Sometimes it&#x27;s a not-too-technical person who just had the application crash or something and they report the issue.  So pick a project and issue that look promising and try to fix it.  If you can fix it within a week (or a day, or whatever), perhaps move on to another issue or project.  Perhaps do this a few times.<p>At some point a maintainer will look at your fix.  They might just apply it directly, or massage it into the project, or they may reject it.  They may have some comments you might learn from.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t spend a lot of time dwelling on it and thinking about which project is &quot;notable&quot; enough to contribute to.  Better just to dive right in.  Just get your feet wet and fix someone&#x27;s problem.  After that, then if you want you can think about which project is notable enough to work with and what looks good in a portfolio.<p>An internship would be essential if you weren&#x27;t work as a &quot;part time...junior fullstack web development(.NET stack and SQL)&quot;.  Since you&#x27;re doing that it becomes less important, and is not necessary and essential.  An internship would not hurt and might help, but since you&#x27;re doing real work, an internship becomes a little less important.<p>> I dont have any big projects done quite yet<p>Big projects start as little projects.  For myself, I took a college course in Java for a few weeks in mid-2009, and then went off and did like I mentioned above - I chose a random open source project and fixed a bug, which was accepted.  Then in late 2010 I spent two months writing a self-contained Java app which did something I wanted to do, I released it as open source.  Along the way I sent a bug report to a similar Javascript app - I noticed two bugs while comparing my app to their app - I did such heavy QA on both apps I probably QA&#x27;d their app more than they did.  Not long after that I started programming simple Android apps, and then more and more complex Android apps - this was in 2011.  Last month my Android apps made over $3000 in revenue.<p>So I would say don&#x27;t worry about &quot;big projects&quot; and &quot;portfolio&quot; and &quot;notable&quot; so much.  Just start small and keep at it.  Things can build on each other as well.  I learned programming.  Then Java.  Then enough Android to do a simple app.  Then I ported a Java library and put an Android UI on it.  Then I ported a C++ library and put an Android UI on it.  Then I ported an OpenGL C++ app to an Android OpenGLES app.  Then I did that a few times and am still doing it.  It would be hard for a .NET developer to port OpenGL C++ apps to Android.  But I started simple, and then using what I learned as a base I did something else simple, then using that higher base I did something else simple, and now I&#x27;m doing something which would be considered slightly complex.<p>I&#x27;ve become interested in AI and machine learning and am starting a project in a simple way.  Right now I am putting the data together and playing with scikit-learn.  Once the data is in good enough shape I will start playing around with it and get more familiar with ML prediction.  My initial model is pretty simple - I go to a few local supermarkets and buy out all their juice (5-6 bottles).  Sometimes I go back and see if the juice is back in stock yet - sometimes it is, sometimes it is not.  So I am keeping tabs on this and will see if I can get ML to predict the probability the juice is back in stock.  It&#x27;s nothing earth shattering, but it will save me a trip to the supermarket, or at least tell me which local one to go to.  I have more ambitious ideas for other uses of ML prediction, but this is simple and useful and is a good first step for me.  Who knows where it may lead?",1424587065

9088456,comment,9087078,9087408,0,0,Zancarius,,,"> And yes, the .45 specifically has a hell of a recoil, though the weight of the slide has a lot to do with it as well. Just remember your basic physics: if you&#x27;re ejecting a 20g projectile at 1200fps, the 600g slide is going to travel backwards at 40 fps (which is still very fast).<p>The 1911 I believe was designed around a ~230 grain projectile (15 grams) that fired at about 850ft/s. There are some 185gr. rounds on the market today that do advertise the 1150-ish ft/s. velocity, but I find in practice that the feel isn&#x27;t markedly different.<p>Along those lines, it&#x27;s important to note that &quot;felt recoil&quot; is perceived somewhat differently to different people (grip strength, hand size, body type), and some people are simply <i>more</i> sensitive to recoil than others. Case in point: I don&#x27;t find the 1911&#x27;s recoil to be particularly notable; some think it kicks like a mule. If you&#x27;re firing heavier projectiles, it&#x27;ll feel like more of a push than a snap, but it&#x27;s definitely not unpleasant (the impulse of the recoil is just as important). The 185gr. rounds tend to be a bit snappier (shorter, faster recoil), but still manageable. I&#x27;d classify &quot;hell of a recoil&quot; as anything from .44 magnum on up, and there&#x27;s plenty of large, really ugly calibers out there that are probably <i>very</i> unpleasant to shoot (500S&W comes to mind). The .45ACP is definitely not one unless you&#x27;re shooting it from a much smaller gun.<p>Since we&#x27;re on the topic of felt recoil and considering it is also a function of the weight of the gun, I&#x27;d much rather shoot a 1911 than some of the tiny .380 autos on the market like the Ruger LCP [1]. If it&#x27;s unpleasant to shoot, you&#x27;re not as likely to practice with it. Even the smaller calibers can hurt if the gun is light enough. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/models.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruger.com/products/lcp/models.html</a>",1424585426

The partial pressure of O2 at the level of the cell is between 3-5mmHg O2.
This changes barely at all whether the body is hyper oxygenated (ie hooked up to high flow O2 in a hospital) or in the middle of a marathon.
The idea that there are &#x27;low oxygen&#x27; centres in our tissues is rediculous pseudoscience. Ie, terms that are sprouted with no meaning.
And what do you mean by organisms? How basic is your understanding of human biology? Do you mean cells? It still has no meaning!<p>>I would intuitively think<p>Well that&#x27;s the problem. 
Life doesn&#x27;t work by intuition no matter how lovely it may feel to be living with the holistic anti science mindset.

The hostilities in Donbass have only been possible because of the Russian covert military involvement, as Girkin has confessed on multiple occasions.<p>Let me ask you a question. Are the Russians living in Nikolaev somehow different to Kiev than the Russians living in Crimea? Why isn&#x27;t there a genocide going on right now? Or why is that the Donbass cities which are under central government control are not being ethnically cleansed and live in peace, just as the rest of Ukraine does?<p>Moreover, half of the Ukrainian Army and National Guard (including the volunteers) speak Russian as their first language, and many of them are ethnic Russians from Donbass and the rest of Ukraine.<p>> The people of Donetsk weren&#x27;t that lucky - the Kiev&#x27;s &quot;pacifier&quot; operation<p>The people of eastern Donbass weren&#x27;t lucky because that&#x27;s where Girkin and his merry band decided to &quot;stir things up&quot; after being inserted from Russia.

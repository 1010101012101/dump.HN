I'm planning to announce a ""breadpig prize"" (http://breadpig.com/prize.html) but wanted to get some feedback on implementation.<p>Ideally, I'd like to use about $3,000 I've earned in profit from various breadpig projects (tees/unholidaycards) as a reward for creating a nifty little (open-source) app.<p>Is there some software you wish existed (that would be worth only 3K of motivation)?  I'm thinking along the lines of a nifty FireFox extension -- the sort of thing you've always said you'd build yourself if you weren't so busy.<p>The other problem is creating a reward system that makes it even worth attempting.  What are the criteria by which a winner is chosen and is it even possible to create something on this small scale that makes it worthwhile to developers to even attempt to be that 1 winner (you all are better than most at probability).<p>Thanks in advance for your thoughts.<p>-Alexis (the reddit co-founder who didn't know Lisp)",1205880878

140295,comment,140044,140278,0,0,brentr,,,"It is very accurate. The problem occurred with the ""division of labor"" that is clearly outlined in the presentation.<p>Many people took out loans that they couldn't pay for. They failed to understand the terms of their mortgage. It didn't help that the mortgage brokers had lowered their lending standards so low that almost anyone could walk in and get a mortgage.<p>It is true that most mortgage companies were simply in the business of brokering as many deals as possible. They didn't care because they just brokered the deal.<p>So the next logical group to place the blame on would be the banks. The banks, and their legions of loan officers, should not have allowed the loans to take place. Unfortunately, banks do take their mortgages and sell them on the open market to investment banks who end up wrapping them up in some derivative product.<p>A good reference work concerning the creation of the mortgage derivatives is a book by Michael Lewis titled Liars Poker. In the book Lewis describes how the mortgage derivatives industry came to be and how they founders of the industry went about valuing these products. It's not a rigorous review at all. That's why many people didn't even know what types of mortgages were in these products.<p>Like my other comment. The article is very accurate. I would like to see legislation to fix the industry as well as some civil and criminal cases because crimes were indeed committed.",1205879745

1982608,comment,1980805,1981330,0,0,radishmouse,,,"I've got a few tips that might make your experience a little better. Option 3 below will be particularly helpful for accessing the documentation more easily.<p>Option 1: Re-map your Expose´ keys.
I mouse (tablet, actually) right handed, so I use the following shortcuts that I can access them quickly with non-mouse hand:<p>F1 - All Applications<p>F2 - All Windows<p>F3 - Desktop<p>F4 - Spaces<p>This allows me to use Expose´/Spaces via keyboard in tandem with the mouse. While technically two steps, it feels more like a single, coordinated step to me.<p>I use XCode in the Condensed (not All-in-One) layout, which results in lots of small windows. I hit F2 (or F1 if I've secluded XCode to a single Space), then either:<p>- mouse over the various windows and press the space bar to see a zoomed-in view of that window. Then, click the one you want to bring into focus.<p>- press an arrow key to highlight a window, press space to see a zoomed-in view, press arrow keys as necessary, and then either press F2 again (or click the left mouse button) to exit Expose´.<p>Option 2: Press Cmd + Shift + D.
This will bring up the ""Open Quickly"" dialog box. Start typing the name of the file you need to open or bring into focus.<p>Option 3: Use shortcuts to go immediately to the definition of a class/method/protocol/etc., toggle between .h/.m files, or open the documentation to whatever's under the mouse.<p>- Press Cmd key then double click a class name (or method name or whatever). This immediately opens a window to the definition.<p>- Press Cmd + Option + Up Arrow to toggle between .h and .m files for a class<p>- Press Option then double click a class/method/etc. name to open the documentation in a floating window.<p>- Press Cmd + Option then double click a class/method/etc. name to open the documentation in the XCode documentation window.<p>Mac OS X is littered with these kinds of accelerated interface shortcuts. I wish I could point you to a good, consolidated guide; but I have yet to find one on the web. Several of them can be found in the opening chapters of Aaron Hillegass' Cocoa programming books.",1291809437

The negrists claim that using the word ""white,"" either on its own or as a component, to talk about all the members of the human species is somehow degrading to blacks and reinforces racism. Therefore the libbers propose that we substitute ""person"" everywhere where ""white"" now occurs. Sensitive speakers of our secretary tongue of course find this preposterous. There is great beauty to a phrase such as ""All whites are created equal."" Our forebosses who framed the Declaration of Independence well understood the poetry of our language. Think how ugly it would be to say ""All persons are created equal,"" or ""All whites and blacks are created equal."" Besides, as any schoolwhitey can tell you, such phrases are redundant.

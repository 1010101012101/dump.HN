137197,comment,136970,137118,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"I think Will Wright's <i>Spore</i> is going to knock this space wide open. It's not web-based, but it is multi-platform and web-enabled. Spore focuses on procedural user-generated content and sharing it across devices as diverse as phones, Nintendo DSes, Wii, PC, and other platforms. It's not completely a game creation toolkit because it doesn't offer the in-depth control that programming offers. But it's related in that Wright's philosophy is to provide an open-ended 'toy' which enables players to create their own game. As a gamer and hacker myself I look forward to seeing this trend develop further.",1205532855

This way, you've neatly created four near-courtyards with one building. Sound like a neat idea? Well, look at the satellite images that Google Earth makes available to every Internet user and you'll realize you've just built a gigantic swastika. Avrahaum Segol, the same Israeli-American researcher who last fall helped publicize a swastika-shaped barracks at Naval Base Coronado in San Diego, is now demanding that the Wesley Acres Methodist retirement home in Decatur, Ala., become less swastika-shaped. Mike Giles, counsel for the Methodist Homes Corp. of Alabama and Northwest Florida, says it might not be able to afford that level of money, and is looking at inexpensive modifications. (The Navy said it would take $600,000 to alter its barracks' design.) Wesley Acres already received a $1 million modification to hide the shape following complaints from a state senator in 2001. Sadly the addition of two wings did little to hide the offensive shape, and in some ways accentuates it.",1205532773

137193,comment,136970,137118,0,0,poppysan,,,"Thanks a lot for the links.  It brings into perspective what those sites are missing,from what i can tell, that would make this idea more viable. But I do have to disagree with you on a point.<p>I do believe that a widget based game maker can make original games as long as its open enough to allow creativity.  From a programming stand-point this directly affects usability, but I would approach it from a design position.<p>Imagine a standard 2d side-scrolling platform engine.  Characters have a bunch of predefined states.  Users must only choose which states they want their character to have(selectable through a survey or wizard). What differentiates Mario from Sonic is only a few actions difference.<p>They are mostly distinct in design.  Allow users a ""bone man"" with pre-made animations and abilities.  Users can build the look with our online editor.   then the designs are applied to the appropriate section of the ""bone man"".<p>Background tiles and objects can also be skinned or selected from pre-made props.<p>Right now at my 9-5 I am working on a children's virtual world and the most time intensive process is asset creation.  This would also be the case in the stated idea.  Animations, character states, and npc's and props would have to be developed over time, and can also be user submitted to speed up the process.<p>I would do 2d games<p>a puzzle game (standard scrolling, adjustable rules)<p>a fighting game (actions ability and looks would be adjustable to name a few)<p>a side scroller action game<p>a racing game<p>and others.<p>All of these would have premade ""bone man"" animations stock that can define a player's personality and skill set.<p>The custom design is the key in my opinion.  i personally would love this.",1205532742

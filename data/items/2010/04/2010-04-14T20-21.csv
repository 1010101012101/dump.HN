1266115,comment,1265327,1265327,0,0,yic,,,"Whenever I see a sensational news like this about China I wonder if the journalist is sincerely stupid or purposely evil. The picture for showing ""exhausted workers"" is a joke: there is a tradition to have a nap after lunch in China so in many businesses the hour after lunch is basically off hours. The place my parents worked for have 2-3 hours of lunch break so everybody can go home and have a nap. In bigger cities where people can't go home, people find convenient places for the nap: on the desk, or ""under"" the desk, and all conference rooms are closed for the same purpose as well. Heck I am still keeping that habit and have a small futon by my desk now (glad I have my own office).<p>The ""sweatshop"" is also a joke for westerners. In more developed cities in China, workers are free to change their employers just like in the west, and it has been in that way for a couple of decades. Those factories don't offer what we called ""hu kou"", so the employer has no power to slave the workers except higher pay.<p>The photo of the worker's dorm room is funny as well. I went to a good university in China (about 14 years ago) and that's how my university dorm looks like. It is difficult for westerners to live in that situation but using that photo as a proof that workers are slaved is misleading.",1271278284

US engaged in multiple aggressive conquests after WW2 without anyone even mentioning the word ""crime"" in a serious context. So aggressive conquest is a common practice, whereas civilian massacre is <i>universally</i> frowned upon - a big difference in my mind.<p>I can see how to tie holocaust to WW2 - the regime which perpetrated the former has then also started the latter. Stalin didn't launch the WW2, but then you can argue he did set it in motion with the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact making both the purges and the WW2 part of his empire-building.

1266102,comment,1265327,1265463,0,0,codexon,,,"I have relatives in Taiwan and you are grossly exaggerating the situation to support your argument.<p>> <i>Okay, my mother worked as a child sweatshop laborer in Taiwan in the 60s, before the country bootstrapped itself out of abject, agrarian poverty, and I take issue with this.</i><p>Much of Taiwan was poor because of Japanese occupation. Some were rich because of it. That divide is the sole reason Taiwan seemed poor to you.<p>My relatives prior to that, had enough land to farm and have a comfortable living. They were able to hire people to help. And from what I heard, that was the middle-class at the time. It is annoying that people look at the poorest farmers who probably had barely-arable land and tilled by hand as proof that all farmers are better off being in a sweat-shop.<p>When WWII came around, the Japanese began to militarize. They seized some of the best land, and they demanded ALL the rice and other staple crops from every farmer. One of my relatives hid some rice to eat, and was beaten to death when the Japanese found out.<p>Meanwhile, the Japanese were trying to assimilate Taiwan quickly, so they artificially consolidated economic power into the Taiwanese who hated China: the rich and nobles who fled from the Communist uprising. This redistribution of wealth impacted my relatives for generations, even today.<p>The outcome? The new upper-class were able to own the natural resources, the capital, and the businesses, while my relatives and many others were left with less land and a decade of lost wealth. Those people lived the life of luxury throughout the 1960's. Tales rebounded of bosses that sat around playing mahjong, harassing female workers, or flying all over the world, while exploited workers worked for their enrichment from 6AM-10PM. However, even this did not last very long.<p>Many companies already started to relocate their sweatshops to China by the late 60's.<p>Taiwan did not need sweatshop labor to pull itself out of poverty. That is highly insulting. It was not because of laziness or stupidity that much of Taiwan was so poor. Like you, my parents' brothers and sisters all graduated from college with graduate degrees. They were forced to to waste 4+ years of their life and money, just so they could be of service to the ruling-class.<p>Meanwhile even today, my college graduated uncle with 15 years of experience is being outranked at a bank by one of the privileged who is fresh from high school. Because businesses pay out workers far less the owners, the gap created by Japan will never be closed.<p>This is why I am not a gung-ho free-capitalist, but I realize that if I were in their shoes, I would definitely be one.",1271277970

This means that this new version is 100% compatible with the old version. We launch new services, test them, add them to the load balancer, and remove the old services from the loadbalancer.<p>* Secondly, a new update is launched: this one is almost the same as the previous version, except that it writes its data in the new model too. The same process with launching new services and adding to the load balancer is repeated.<p>Using this two-phase upgrade has the major advantage that you're always running the new services next to an old version that is completely compatible, data-model-wise, and thus allows you to do an emergency rollback to a previous version if required. The trick with adding to the load balancer also ensures that no downtime is experienced for the clients.<p>All this requires quite a bit of work (especially since you need to deploy multiple releases),  so it depends on how much zero-downtime upgrades are worth to you.",1271277545

But when it comes to funding and politics studies like this will always be used to 'prove' that the problem is 'solved' and that we no longer need to worry about it; therefore we can eliminate funding to the cause with no consequences. [ Of course, none of the politicians actually bothers to fund studies into whether or not the funding is needed to keep the trend from reversing. ]",1271277362

Google isn't free loading anywhere. It either pays someone to carry it's traffic from it's data center to the next ISP or it already has that infrastructure and trades bandwidth on its network for traffic on the other ISP network. Since google bought a large chunk of dark fiber, they have lots of capacity and are making a sweet deal, it seems, to other ISP which allows them to pay nothing almost nothing for bandwidth except for the infrastructure.<p>What these ISP want is: when one of their customers wants to access a google site, google pays them for the traffic that goes over their network.<p>What doesn't make sense with that is that the traffic is already paid for twice, once with the customers subscription and another time before the data reaches this particulars ISP's network. (If google peers directly with them, they have some sort of deal currently, if the google doesn't then the ISPs inbetween already have a deal with this ISP for the traffic). In effect they are trying to find a way to charge another time for something that already paid for.",1271277345

It could be tiring and nasty but I went home with pride and money.  I'm not doing that kind of work now but my point is it was a good start.<p>I'll tell you precisely what provokes outrage in me:  the use of physical violence or the threat of physical violence.  Example:  ""When I tried to quit this disgusting, dangerous, demeaning, and exhausting job, the manager struck me in the face and locked me in a room until I apologized.""  Example:  ""When I mentioned that I might quit this horrible job, the manager said that there was nowhere to hide, and his people would find me and make me sorry.""<p>Now <i>that</i> is the kind of thing that really outrages me.  But consider this:  ""I was raised on a farm and came to work at this factory and I hate every minute of it, but I'm still working here because I'd rather do that than go back to the farm or wander the streets homeless.""<p>That does <i>not</i> outrage me.  It saddens me, yes.  I'm very sorry that this individual at this time in her life only has such poor and few choices.  However, I must <i>allow</i> her that choice.  The <i>worst</i> thing I could do is use the threat of violence in the other direction, as in:  ""If you try to work in a factory for 80 cents an hour, I will physically restrain both you and the factory manager.""  The only thing I would accomplish by that, apart from violating my own code of conduct, is to limit the options of this individual, consigning her back to the farm or streets.<p>The very <i>best</i> thing I could do is compete in the labor market, creating new opportunities and offering higher wages and better conditions.  Although I am not a factory manager, that is always my aim.  For many years in my business it was just my partner and I doing all the work.

If they didn't have the direct peer with Google, one of their other Tier 1 peers would have to provide it to them, which would surely change the terms of their peering agreement (cost them $$$).  What's more, if you can get traffic from a peer for free that is destined for an endpoint on your network, you ALWAYS want to take it.

1266032,comment,1265104,1265104,0,0,dasht,,,"Huh.  Well, that's me (Tom Lord).   So, what can I add here for HN?<p>Some of the comments talk about Andy Wingo's good work and leadership in recent years.  I agree.  Of course, Guile was once my baby, long ago, complete with sleepless nights and other trappings of nervous parenthood.  Consequently, I see almost all of the big technical changes made to Guile recently as The Wrong Way.  But that's a purely personal, emotional reaction;  objectively I see that he's doing good work.<p>Guile failed / stalled for a few years there.  It's a bit hard to talk about why.  I'll say a few words about it and also point to a link with a an alternative telling of the same tale.<p>Guile got started after some earlier, failed attempts to write a Scheme extension language library for Scheme.  There were two earlier attempts that I know of: one called ""revoc"" (read it backwards) and the other had no name but happened as part of an early GNU spreadsheet project.<p>I went to work for a start-up that, then, had something like 30 employees.   It was an unusual start-up for its day for the software part of all of their products was free software.   The Linux kernel didn't exist when the company was founded and it barely existed when I first started at that firm.<p>The firm was Cygnus, of course.  Back then it was called ""Cygnus Support"".<p>Cygnus got it into its collective head, for a short period of time, to build a general purpose user interface toolkit for writing GUI apps -- and to make this GUI toolkit Scheme-based and to write GUI apps that were architecturally similar to GNU Emacs, but with fancier graphics and interaction.  Building that thing was to be my job.<p>To save time I started with Aubrey Jaffer's Scheme implementation called SCM.  I forked SCM and began radically modifying it to make it more useful as a library and to add various desirable features.   I wrote a C library for Guile to give it a generic window system interface, providing an X11 implementation of that library.   Towards the end, I had much of the heavy lifting of the toolkit done and perhaps another 6-12 months before a real product.  In my toolkit I even had a basic Emacs-like program except with features that Emacs lacked at the time like support for multiple-font text and proportionally spaced fonts.   It was kind of neat because nearly all of the redisplay code, and all of the code for ""text widgets"", was written in Scheme - and yet performed reasonably well on even the slow machines of the time.  It was a very ""hackable"", fun, toolkit.<p>Alas, there were political problems.   The sales staff at Cygnus, especially, were displeased that the project was taking so long: they had been hoping to have GUIs to show at trade-shows mere months after I started.   The famous ""Tcl Wars"" happened and that led to some political infighting within Cygnus.   Cygnus was seeking a next round of VC funding and there was pressure to cut the Guile project from the budget.   Most annoyingly, my boss at the end showed me a contract he'd negotiated to help fund Guile work and asked me to approve it.  I felt that the contract had some severe problems and would need to be fixed before I could agree to it - he'd negotiated it without any input from me.   The next day he signed the contract.  About a week later I felt duty bound to quit (because of the contract and because of some bullshit issues about my working remotely).   The demise of the Guile project at Cygnus was a profoundly unpleasant experience.<p>Quitting, at that time, was a somewhat crazy step to take.  We parted on less than friendly terms.   I had been accustomed to job searching in the Silicon Valley, back in those days, this way:   you call a few recruiters;  you fax or email them your resume;  you have phone calls for a few days;  you get some interviews;  you take your next job.  The Valley was, truly, the Garden of Earthly Delights for a hacker in those boom years.   This time was different.  I spoke to several otherwise decent recruiters who all quickly, and to my surprise, made it clear to me that each and every one had been warned away from me by people close to Cygnus.<p>Some people will tell you that the Silicon Valley elites back then did not secretly blacklist people from employment.  Those people are variously mistaken or lying.  Get on the wrong side of a couple of those elites and, in my experience - that was it.  You're out.  The U-Haul place is down the street.  On-ramp to highway 80 is over there.  Get out of town.  See you in the next life.<p>Shortly after that I had to abandon my status as the GNU Guile maintainer (at status conveyed by the FSF, not Cygnus) for financial reasons: I was busy working out some way to keep a roof over my family's head.  The project was taken over by one of the ""revoc"" developers about whose work on it, during that period, I have nothing nice to say.<p>Within those next few years the Linux kernel's foothold got quite strong.   The FSF greatly diminished its efforts to build a ""complete GNU system"" and, rather than making sure lots of interactive applications were extensible in the style of Emacs, the GNU project became more of a follower than a leader.<p>In those same next few years, a faction of people close to Cygnus who had first hostilely forked GCC then forced its maintainership away from the FSF.<p>Overall, the FSF became far less proactive at software development and the original ""vision"" of a lisp-centric improved version of unix fell by the wayside.   One of the last big actions from GNU was to endorse an alternative GUI app framework - GNOME - on the grounds that at least it didn't have the licensing problems that, at the time, KDE had.  Any remaining hope of directly developing the lisp-style environment we'd started out to build evaporated right there.<p>Here is a different version of some part of the same story (also as told by me, and why should you believe me? :-)<p><a href=""http://basiscraft.com/0800-0100-the-tcl-war.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://basiscraft.com/0800-0100-the-tcl-war.html</a><p>(Where did I go after Cygnus?

4493496,comment,4489364,4492550,2,0,KirinDave,,,"> In my opinion you are creating a false dichotomy between having learned and learning. Someone who has just started to walk/bike etc has still learned to walk/bike. They are by no means near entering Olympics for the next few years but they have made their own life very much simpler and more enjoyable. (Father of small children here.)<p>The fundamental difference here is that bikes are ridden in a way that's fundamentally unchanged for decades. Contrary to this ""settled"" field of knowledge, programming is constantly invalidating itself. Even if you achieve competency in a limited field (perhaps operating system design or web development), that field will almost certainly overturn itself within 5 years for any reasonably broad definition of field. Consider what modern linux looks like compared to the original version; a lot of new techniques have emerged to address requirements.<p>To enter that field, this new knowledge is not ""optional."" It's required. The goalposts for competency aren't just shifting; they've got a nuclear power supply and tank treads and they're out of control.<p>In this, it is not unlike being a doctor. Their knowledge base is similarly in constant flux (although not quite so violently as ours). A doctor who does not constantly improve and update their knowledge will be a substantially worse doctor than one who does. A perfect example of this is pre-scientific doctors like homeopaths, who basically do nothing with an almost frightening level of dedication and fervor.<p>> Comments like yours are discouraging at least one specific subset of people from doing the one thing that can possibly help them increase their skills<p>I did not direct this at some 16 year old kid or a non-programmer, nor did I put it in a venue where non-tech people read. Even if I did, citing final consequence is hardly a good argument.  In any case, the industry does a pretty good job of discouraging people from joining as it is. When I was in college, there was a 60% dropout rate between lower and upper division classes.",1347126932

I'm just observing that this particular parent likes to get high, and I don't find that newsworthy.<p>Whether I consider taking a prescribed medication ""getting high"" depends on the dose and the use-case.<p>Vicodin contains an opioid, so if you are not in pain but take it, you will get high. Actually, its codeine derivative is variably metabolized so you may not get high (or pain relief, for that matter).<p>Xanax (alprazolam) is a benzo, whose effects are similar to alcohol. I don't think most people would consider this a ""high"", whether or not for therapeutic purposes.<p>Ritalin (methylphenidate) is a stimulant; people do use it to get high, sometimes even people who are prescribed it for a real medical problem.<p>The 'high' is a side effect of many medical therapies that we'd like to get rid of, if possible, to improve our ability to help people without the scourges of addiction and abuse. The same is true of marijuana, for some uses; for this particular person's use, however, the goal is to get high.",1347124482

For example, I was looking to buy a coffee grinder and the reviews were all over the place. It's obvious that a lot didn't read the instructions or had higher expectations than a product at that price point would provide. People complain that a $30 item is made mainly of plastic.<p>You can rebut.   I mean, for a long time the first hit for 'prgmr.com' was a thread on webhostingtalk[1] where someone was complaining that I hadn't set them up and that I had problems.  Fair complaints, on the other hand, at the time, five dollars was an unheard of price for what I was providing (It's no longer an unheard-of price.  Moore's law abides.)   I responded and eh, I think I ended up coming out looking okay.<p>I guess the thing is, acknowledging your mistakes, yes, is very unprofessional, but really?  I think people are sick of dealing with professionals.  Showing some humanity and some humility (even when it's the 'false humility' we all put on so that our arrogance is less irritating to others.)  can help you a lot.<p>On the other hand, on that same website, I'm trying to sell burstable 10G cogent ports[2] for a price that is currently unheard of, and I've gotten no bites, so It's possible that people prefer professionals for expensive things and humans for cheap things.<p>Note, though, (and this is the 'false humility' I describe)  you don't want to directly say ""you are too dumb to use the product""  - even if they are.  I mean, you want to explain the proper use of the product, and you want to back out the deals (refunds, usually) with the people that are unwilling or unable to do it correctly.  Saying things here like 'Oh, I should improve this documentation here'  or 'oh, I should link to this other documentation over there' is also good, especially if you really can improve that documentation.    Personally, I think having a reputation for being not particularly easy to use is very good.

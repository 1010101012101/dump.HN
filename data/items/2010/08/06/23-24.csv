Respectfully, there is much popular opposition to the war, it has materialized, and there is plenty of photographic and video evidence of exactly how much war sucks.<p>If you have evidence that the military deliberately killed a journalist, please share it with me.<p>And respectfully, the military has done a good job of helping journalists do their job.  Mike Yon, who was openly critical of General McChrystal (and frankly kind of unprofessional in how he did it) has spent a long time in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and is apparently now on his way back for yet another embed.<p>Also, I think it might be worth pointing out that while the US military often does get it wrong -- causing collateral damage that is sometimes disproportionate to the tactical objective, and does kill innocent civilians, I have yet to see a case where killing innocent civilians was their actual goal.  This is in stark contrast to the people the US military is fighting against -- Al Quaeda remnants and some elements of the Taliban -- who target civilians intentionally.<p>Personally I don't think the amount of effort we're expending in Afghanistan is justified based on the expected future benefit, and after a long time supporting our mission there I'm ready to pull our forces out.  But Julian Assange is doing his best to make sure a) America looks worse than it is, b) that American soldiers have a harder job to do and c) anyone Afghans who have reached out to us in the past are more likely to pay a price for it in the future.<p>If Assange had taken the time to sanitize the documents he released of any information regarding names and villages of sources, I'd have more sympathy for him.  Instead he stupidly and needlessly put their lives in danger, and now wants to blame the US military for their deaths.  He's a piece of shit.",1281139049

1582667,comment,1582219,1582219,0,0,Ramfjord,,,"I believe there's some problem with assuming that, given an envelope containing X dollars, that the other envelope has a 50% chance of containing 2x, and a 50% chance of containing X/2.  This step is clearly what leads us into the paradox.<p>Suppose you open the first envelope, and find $100, and are given the option to switch.  If there is a 50/50 chance of the other envelope containing 200/50, we could easily model this problem a million times and find that it averages to 125.<p>The problem here is that the numbers have not been pre-determined in the start.  If a naive player repeatedly played a game where the numbers are guaranteed to be 100 and 200, then the always switching strategy would be exactly the same as the always staying strategy.<p>In this case, let the difference between the two envelopes be x.  When you switch, you have a 50% chance of losing x and a 50% chance of gaining x.  There is really no problem if you define the two envelopes as differing by a fixed number, rather than one being a multiple of the other.  When the two numbers have fixed, predetermined values, the two problems are the same.",1281138533
1582666,comment,1582219,1582519,0,0,_delirium,,,"Under a frequentist interpretation of probability that's correct (and the paradox doesn't arise), but Bayesian decision theory <i>does</i> allow you to reason in the way the paradox proposes, starting in a situation where you've already picked an envelope, and estimating the utility of switching to the other one by multiplying the probability that you're in the high->low configuration with the value of a high->low switch, and likewise with a low->high switch. So you have 50% chance of halving your money, 50% of doubling, and thus estimated 1.25x return.<p>Frequentist probability doesn't let you do that, because it doesn't let you say ""there's a 50% likelihood I'm in this state, and 50% that I'm in the other"". Instead, it says you <i>must</i> be in one or the other state (non-probabilistically), and the probabilities are only attached to a previous process that generated that outcome. But Bayesian probability does let you interpret the probabilities as belief in each <i>current</i> state, so you have a 50% belief you're in one state, and a 50% belief you're in the other, and the value of any decision is thus 0.5 * value_if_I_was_in_situation_A + 0.5 * value_if_I_was_in_situation_B.<p>(If you don't allow that kind of computation, Bayesian decision theory has to be revised in some other cases as well.)",1281138532

I have always told them that their best hope of making their lives work will be to found their own company.  They can very effectively get things done but I don't think they can work for other people.  When you found your own company, you don't need accreditation.  Either the product sells or it doesn't.<p>Similarly, I spent a lot of time very sick.  I made a lot of dietary and lifestyle changes and I am healthier now than I have ever been in my life.  I am not a doctor but I am also not impressed with the current healthcare model followed in the US.  I think I have a cheaper and more effective alternative to offer.  Study after study after study shows that diet and lifestyle are huge factors in all the major (deadly) illnesses, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer.  But doctors mostly don't push for dietary and lifestyle changes.  They are mostly in the business of selling pills and surgeries.  A big part of why they don't is that people aren't very receptive.  Many people just want an easy answer.  And it's quite hard to make money off of promoting lifestyle changes.<p>So to me, the big challenges are how to more effectively convey information and how to monetize it.  I am still trying to decide if I should largely abandon my current websites and start over in a new space.  I don't yet know the answer to that.  But I do know that I have narrowed it down to ""education is the answer"" and I do know that I am very good at some things that other people seem to not be good at.  I know this from years spent on homeschooling forums where for some particularly difficult things, I often was the only person who had much to say.<p>So I find this article very relevant at the moment and encouraging.  I don't know if I have much to really contribute to the conversation that will be of interest to others or that they will value. Perhaps I just need to talk about it.  For my own goals, accreditation is unimportant.  The piece that matters is whether or not the information is conveyed adequately, which my current websites are not doing.  I think I will be doing something educational on the web in the future.  So I am kind of excited to see this piece.",1281138343

Education in higher academia is about much more than the acquisition of particular facts--it's a culture, practice, and way of life. Critical ideas are meant to be discussed in person, ruminated on, and debated in real, highly dynamic discussions. Real life work environments, especially in software companies, are ones in which critical, GROUP brainstorming dynamics are particularly important, because oftentimes the answer doesn't lie in the answer key in the back of the book, but rather as a result of a group process of rumination, guess, check, and revision.",1281138332

1582644,comment,1581830,1582466,0,0,sesqu,,,"I've got to agree here. The short form is great for those ubiquitous ""set if null"" pieces of code, but you wouldn't want to use one for a complex conditional. The advantage comes in when you recognize the intent from the way it's formulated, and so don't have to trace the syntax. If your clause is something like ""y%4==0 && (y%100!=0 || y%400==0)"", you may want the long form, even for null y. I feel the example return statement is pushing it.<p>Additionally, it only works if you can trust that what is written is what is intended - which can be a problem with the gotchas in the truthiness system. If you aren't sure what type the input will have, you'll want the explicit checks, and if you don't have a helper function, those can drag on long enough to make it unreasonable to expect the reader to see the guard pattern.<p>All in all, I consider the short form a form of self-documenting code.

1582639,comment,1582402,1582402,0,0,ja27,,,"Why shouldn't it be?<p>For most of my college career, I was taught in a non-interactive lecture (from 15 to 300 students at a time). Sometimes the lectures were even being recorded or simulcast to remote locations. The lecturer often had no idea who I was. In graduate school, I got a good look at the ""sausage factory"" of how many core computer science class lectures are really developed. Unless it's an area of research and publication for the professor, they do a minimal amount of work on their lecture notes and exams. In some cases, the same professor taught the same subject year after year. Sometimes this resulted in progressively better notes, but sometimes not. In other cases, the class rotated among professors. They often took each other's lecture notes and used them with varying degrees of revision. Only when a course was a true passion of the professor was the lecture anything much more than what could be gleaned from a couple of textbooks on the topic.<p>Beyond the lectures, most of the labs and assignments were handled by grad student teaching assistants. I also got to see many of my friends go through the TA machine in grad school. The rare lucky ones got to TA a course related to their research, but most TAs were assigned to courses where they only knew as much as they'd learned in their own undergrad experience in that course. A few TAs would scramble to get up to speed. The smart ones would do the bare minimum for the course and focus on their research.<p>Then there are the textbooks. I look at the dead tree debris that on my bookshelves from my nearly dozen years of higher education and very few books contain anything beyond what's on Wikipedia today.<p>I can look back at a topic like ""operating systems"" and cringe. This was a undergraduate course that rotated amongst professors. At the time I took it, I'd already been on a dozen operating systems including VMS, NeXTStep and Dynix, played with Minix code, read Bach and Tanenbaum, etc. The PhD student assigned to <i>teach</i> my class had an undergrad in linguistics. I believe he'd never even logged into any unix system, much less had an operating systems course himself. He even dropped out late in the semester and disappeared. I damn near asked for a refund, but I took my grade and moved on.<p>There's no reason that a few passionate people on the web couldn't top that.",1281137719

1582615,comment,1581985,1582492,0,0,Natsu,,,"Indeed he is correct.  But I would like to note that you can cap how much space you waste on incompressible things, though.  Just store a flag with it that indicates whether that chunk of data is incompressible and don't even try to compress the incompressible things.  The decoder for that is simple:  read the flag (which only has to be 1 bit) and decompress it if it was compressed, or just return the unchanged data otherwise.<p>However, you'll still find that there are still limits to exactly how much you can compress things.  And you'll find that, sometimes when you think you've found something that looks like it should be able to compress things down to nothing, that you've just been hiding the data in your decompression program.<p>In a sense, when you consider special-purpose compression and decompression functions, it's not unlike how ""RETR some_huge_file.rar"" sent to an FTP program will ""decompress"" that tiny string into some multi-GB file.

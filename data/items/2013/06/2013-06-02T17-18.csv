From my experience there are many <i>extremely</i> talented programmers in London, and these guys can work anywhere they want, including starting their own company or moving to the US.<p>Also 'coolness' is hard to define, I see many startups think cool is having some beanbags and a pingpong table, whilst working on a standard CRUD RoR app. To most talented engineers, they would much rather be working on interesting technical challenges. This is how hedge funds get them:  squeezing a few millis out of an already optimal trading engine by whatever means possible is extremely fun.

Some things that genetic modification can do are impossible with the ancient methods.<p>Even if GM produced a plant that was truly superior and healthier in every way, there's no good way to trust it.

Looking at some recent posts about salaries, the $35/hour they offered me pales in comparison with the $100+/year I've been seeing. I did some independent research, and it's not hard to find people charging $120+/hour. I suspect I'm being lowballed specifically because I'm not based in the US.<p>I like to think I have a good experience. I'm a Ruby/PHP/JS developer with 6 years of solid professional experience, plus 2 years studying before I got my first real job. Worked remotely at least at some capacity this entire time. I did a very technical interview with this company, and they seemed very impressed (as in ""we do not see this all the time"").<p>So my question is: how do I get better rates as an offshore dev? I'd rather not move to the US right now (Brazil is very cheap outside the capitals, and I'm saving money to move to Europe next year), but that's not completely out of the question. I've seen people suggesting to bill by the week instead of hourly, should I try that? I have some projects on my portfolio (I'm adding a couple of personal projects to that list this month), but I don't have much open source code, maybe I should work a little bit on that? Or are my rates already average based in my experience? I have difficulties evaluating my own skills, so maybe I'm asking too much.<p>Thanks in advance for your input!",1370195793

I rank the lambda calculus much higher than C or assembly language when it comes to that.  I would say that knowing your data structures and how to analyze algorithms asymptotically is vastly more important than knowing how code is being executed at a low level.<p>Even for the cases where low-level code must be written, I would say we need people who know assembly language and compiler theory more than we need people who know C.  There is no particularly good reason for C to be <i>anywhere</i> in the software stack; you can bootstrap Lisp, ML, etc. without writing any C code.  We need people who know how to write optimizing compilers; those people do not need to know C, nor should they waste their time with C.<p>Really, the most important computing concept people need to learn is <i>abstraction</i>.  Understanding that a program can be executed as machine code, or an interpreted IR, or just interpreting an AST, and that code can itself be used to construct higher level abstractions is more important than learning any particular language.",1370195700

Further, the European Union disapproved of Turkey's history of military coups, making it clear that they weren't going to admit a country that relied on military coups to defend its constitution from democracy.  So the military did not remove Erdogan, despite the AKP's moderate Islamic agenda.<p>The military is a conservative force in Turkish society insofar as it defends an interpretation of the constitution and politics rooted in Ataturk's ideology from the 1920s.

5809396,comment,5808627,5808957,3,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> If the reason you want to move from a permanent salaried position to contract work is to make more money, don't.<p>This may be correct in some cases, but it's not universally true.<p>1. Yes, there are a lot of things contractors must do that salaried employees don't, but activities like developing and maintaining a portfolio and invoicing don't have to be a drag if you set up efficient systems and processes.<p>2. Pricing strategy is really important. If you're seeking an hourly rate of, say, $120 but only 50% of your time is billable, you might want to consider the possibility that you'd net more by reducing your hourly rate. In a lot of cases, contractors who struggle with billable hours don't realize that trying to maximize the rate they can get one or two clients to pay will often minimize billable hours. With the <i>right</i> rate, you can attract more clients more easily, allowing you to diversify if you so choose. You will also find that clients want to send you more work instead of getting you in and out as quickly as possible.<p>3. You don't need to have an ""identity"" to get business. Unless you're trying to be the top gun for hire who bills $200/hour with no resistance or limit your work to the most <i>interesting</i> or cutting edge projects, there are plenty of opportunities out there that don't require you to be ""known."" If you have a solid portfolio of work, are responsive and can communicate well, you can acquire clients without a Coca-Cola like branding process.<p>4. The reason self-employment is criticized from a tax perspective is that most people don't do three things: educate themselves, keep good records and hire a good accountant. As a self-employed contractor, your legitimate business expenses, including home office use, are deductible. Additionally, half of the amount you pay for self-employment tax is deductible as well. Throw in the ability to set up a solo 401(k) where you can contribute up to $17,500 of your earnings as an elective deferral plus 20% to 25% of the profit of your business as a employer profit sharing contribution, and being a contractor can actually be better for contractors at a certain point.<p>5. If you're constantly surprised by clients cutting your hours or ending the relationship without warning, you're not managing your client relationships well. Period.<p>> The salaried employee agrees to work for less than the market rate, and in exchange the employer agrees to subsidize your down time. In other words, you don't have to worry about constantly finding the next thing to do just to get paid. You get to focus on the work.<p>There are no guarantees when you're a contractor, and it isn't for everybody, but let's not pretend that salaried employment is a risk-free proposition either.<p>At the end of the day, no employer is going subsidize down time in perpetuity. If there's nothing for you to do, or the value that you're creating doesn't exceed what you're being paid by a wide enough margin, there's no reason you should assume that your job is safe. If anything, this is the great lesson you learn from being a contractor: time is money. If you want to be paid for your time, and paid fairly, your time eventually has to be seen as having the capacity to create monetary value for the person or company you're serving.",1370195309

I recommend to the OP that if he genuinely does not enjoy what he is doing, he seek out some other field, part time work or simply long-term employment where his employer will appreciate algorithmic innovations (I find computer vision to be an excellent field for this).",1370195219

The difference between someone who works as a programmer, who takes it just as a job but of course can be extremely good at it - just like anything else you practice a lot; and someone who is a programmer. They are lexically the same but they mean different things. The last one, beside working (or not) as a programmer, does it for the art of it. Who not necessarily learns or does something (ships) because it's needed or it provides anything else beside the joy and fulfilment of learning and understanding it. For example, at work, when you want to stop programming you open your own personal open source project and relax for an hour with it. Then you go home after 8 hours of programming and start up your IDE and carry on with your art that may or may not ever see the light of day and it makes no difference.",1370195218

5809373,comment,5804134,5804134,2,0,dmmalam,,,"tldr: despite the flawed stats of the poll, similar skillets are actually paid similarly between London and SV.<p>It's hard to compare directly between SV and London because they're very different economically. SV is full of huge pure tech companies (the googles, apples, facebooks) that are hugely profitable and HAVE to spend heavily on R&D. Their product is literally technology and so they need 'high end' engineers. This therefore attracts 'high end' engineers from around the world, and the large number of these companies created a bidding war, hence wages rise.<p>The majority of developer jobs in London (and for that matter everywhere except SV) are at enterprises where they are slogging out backend code - think projects to integrate internal systems. Most of these roles aren't particularly 'high end' and don't need guru 99 percentile programmers, and hence they can pay less. Most of these companies see tech as a necessary evil and not a competitive advantage.<p>For these enterprise roles, base salary is also meaningless as nearly everyone contracts. A typical 'senior java dev' that pays 60k permanent, would contract for 500/day which is the equivalent of 115k [1]. Rates upto 700 are common, and 1000 isn't unheard-of for rare skills in vogue. Junior programmers should expect 350+<p>So comparing like-for-like skill set, London programmers are actually paid pretty well - There are many making the equivalent of $150k+ who wouldn't even pass a phone screen for Google. Now London has a few 'high end' roles that pay very well, the majority of which are in finance, with notable exceptions being the London engineering offices of big SV tech companies. Don't be mislead that all of finance is high paying, only the front office roles at the 'computationally intensive' desks are. There are also 'high end' but relatively low paying roles at game companies, F1 and GCHQ.<p>Another factor is the financial crisis, which has hit London <i>severely</i>. Since 2008 a huge number of jobs have gone, and wages have been essentially flat. If you include the fact the the GBP:USD rate went from $2.10 to under $1.4 at the lowest [2], UK wages actually declined 40% in USD equivalent. This is in stark contrast to SV which in the same period saw huge growth.<p>The funny thing is that almost the opposite was happening just a few years ago. I graduated in 2006, and London was in the middle of a huge boom. I was at Imperial College, and all the major firms would come to campus and have big flashy recruitment drives. There just weren't enough quality engineers and so starting packages for fresh graduates were literally twice what ANYONE else was paying. Also many of these roles were extremely interesting, working on real problems with cutting edge tech and brilliant people, and the firms had enough money to invest in training, extravagant grad programs etc. This has changed quite a bit now!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.contractorcalculator.co.uk/ContractorFinancialProfileSummary.aspx?uid=0&logon=False&psalary=50000&div=1&status=OutsideIR35&pyt=LimitedCompany&expenses=3000&other=0&pension=0&tc=944L&age=30&salary=8000&rate=62.5&rt=Hourly&rt2=Hourly&weeks=44&dwpw=5&dwpw2=5&hours=37.5&dni=4000&tty=2013&rate2=25&weeks2=44&hours2=37.5&status2=OutsideIR35&psalary2=50000&mir=0.05&ma=200000&mp=25&cid=0&vat=1&vi=False&ar=1&gs1=0&gs2=0&gs3=0&gs4=0&nd=1&pbt=1&dpo=03-May-2013&dop=01-Jan-0001&inv=1&hpd=11&me=150&vt=Car&mpw=0&mpc=0&pt=Monthly&ace=500&mt=Parasol&wl=InsideLondon&uds=Basic&Host=LOCAL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contractorcalculator.co.uk/ContractorFinancialPro...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=GBPUSD=X&t=5y&l=on&z=l&q=l&c="" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=GBPUSD=X&t=5y&l=on&#...</a>",1370194843

Engineering is the act of balancing tradeoffs scientifically and ensuring that quality goals are effectively met.<p>You might call any autodidact coder a programmer.

I would expect senior and above level software engineers to have experience in most or all of the topics above, and I'm sure there are more that deserve to be on the list.<p>Engineering in the software field isn't /always/ about building super-reliable things. That is one factor that I think differentiates it from other engineering fields. Engineering in the real, physical space has safety implications that typically require a high level of rigor at minimum. If a bridge fails or a building collapses, that's catastrophic. Physical products are only useful if engineered to a high level of quality. However, software is useful across a wider spectrum of reliability: if a back-office web app used by the recruiting team has to come down for maintenance for 2 hours on Sunday, that may not be a showstopper.<p>Consequently, part of software engineering is understanding what level of robustness is needed to meet business goals, and building to it appropriately, with appropriate costs, and understanding the properties of the built system. Controlling the level of reliability is what makes it engineering.<p>To be fair, I cannot account for what someone else means when they say they're a software engineer.

But there's always another level below you that can be valuable...Allen says C killed her  interest in programming...not because it was hard, but because of, in her opinion, it led engineers to abandon work in compiler optimization (her focus was in high-performance computing):<p>(Excerpted from: Peter Seibel. Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming (Kindle Location 6269).

I kind of stopped when C came out. That was a big blow. We were making so much good progress on optimizations and transformations. We were getting rid of just one nice problem after another. When C came out, at one of the SIGPLAN compiler conferences, there was a debate between Steve Johnson from Bell Labs, who was supporting C, and one of our people, Bill Harrison, who was working on a project that I had at that time supporting automatic optimization...The nubbin of the debate was Steve's defense of not having to build optimizers anymore because the programmer would take care of it. That it was really a programmer's issue....</i><p><i>Seibel: Do you think C is a reasonable language if they had restricted its use to operating-system kernels?</i><p><i>Allen: Oh, yeah. That would have been fine. And, in fact, you need to have something like that, something where experts can really fine-tune without big bottlenecks because those are key problems to solve. By 1960, we had a long list of amazing languages: Lisp, APL, Fortran, COBOL, Algol 60. These are higher-level than C. We have seriously regressed, since C developed. C has destroyed our ability to advance the state of the art in automatic optimization, automatic parallelization, automatic mapping of a high-level language to the machine. This is one of the reasons compilers are ... basically not taught much anymore in the colleges and universities.</i>",1370194268

They were based in Soho and shockingly badly run. My client would often visit and bang on about changes in a wild a crazy manner. Only late did I find out that he had been upstairs first to snort cocaine with the company's owner. After not being paid on time again and again, I was getting fed up, and a good friend rang, with the words, ""Moneypenny, I desperately need you here"". He was contracting at a huge agency over in E1, and they had a game they needed to build. He talked me up to the people in charge there and next thing I knew, I was a contractor on 325 a day. That was seven years ago and I've always remained a contractor. It's got me in shedloads of trouble over the years with HMRC and Companies House due to my organization skills, but I've never looked back. Unlike many of my greedy-bastard friends who simply contract all year long to rake in the cash, I routinely take time off to travel - took ten months off to drive from Canada to Panama and back, three months off to drive around Australia, it's the only way to go. And until two weeks ago, I had never had a single job from a recruiter. Word of mouth only.<p>Advice: do it.<p>More advice: get the best accountants you can, ones that will do as much as possible for you.",1370193510

DSLs aren't a gimme.

2241972,comment,2241268,2241268,0,0,6ren,,,"I don't like to think anyone is hopeless. That's because to be truly hopeless requires mathematical certainty, which usually isn't possible in the real world. In the real world, we don't know everything; there are always unknowns. Where there are unknowns, there is a chance; there is hope.<p>Giving love and care and respect to these alcoholics... I would expect that that might help some of them to recover. The article doesn't mention it, but I wonder if some do recover.<p>It certainly seems economically justifiable. Which doesn't necessarily make it right, since an economic analysis doesn't take into account all the factors. A society that starts to classify some people as hopeless and give up on them, may gradually widen its definition of <i>hopeless</i>. Whereas some of the greatest benefits and victories for society seem to come from goals that seemed impossible, aka <i>hopeless</i>.<p>If we undermine that, we will be the worse for it.",1298213881

Should be fun monetizing that market, their site seems to fit a niche ideally suited for this. I'd love to see how they monetize services when (and if) they are dealing with the semi-urban areas; maybe they can tie up with a mobile service provider to have their services paid for as part of their mobile phone bill.<p>When you say Urban India is monolithic, are you meaning to say that all urban life is generally similar in India?<p>If so I would point out that the Metros in India differ significantly. I'm a Mumbai/Bombay native, and have family in Delhi and friends all over the country. From their discussions and lifestyles, each metro is quite unique and even more so, in the context of male-female interactions.<p>For example Delhi has been described as bastion of MCP behavior universally, especially by the women who live there. It could be a bad sample, but that view contrasts strongly with the better reputation for female safety that Mumbai, and (afaik) Bangalore enjoy. This leads to major differences - I know someone who moved here from Delhi, and wouldn't travel alone post 8:00 pm for a long time. (Delhi people, please correct me if I am wrong, or something is being missed). At the same time, Delhi-ites seem to have a lot more cultural activities going on than Mumbai. Since space is also not at a premium in Delhi, it also has places like Bookstores that are sorely missing in Mumbai.",1298213839

I did a search and it doesn't even contain the word ""entrepreneur"".<p>Short version: He's writing a book. He thinks that for the amount of debt involved, you can go do much more gratifying things in life than college from age 18 to 22. Oh, and he's writing a book.<p>My best understanding is that there is some correlation between successful entrepreneurs (like Bill Gates) and dropping out of college.  I do not know if that correlation runs both ways.  I would be very reluctant to suggest that dropping out makes you a better entrepreneur.  I think it probably goes in the other direction:  People who have what it takes to be good entrepreneurs sometimes skip past the silly credentialing stage and get on with making things and let the chips fall where they may.  Folks who have an idea for a business but feel the credential is important and are thus unwilling to forgo college to focus on their business may never make the necessary commitment -- staying in school may turn out to be one of many excuses as to why they ultimately just won't put it all on the line.  But dropping out of college in no way guarantees one will do anything worthwhile with their time/money in place of it.",1298213708

2241958,comment,2241734,2241734,0,0,ollysb,,,"I've been practising BDD for a few years now. For whatever reason I'll sometimes find myself coding without having first written a reason. You know what, I always find that I'm really not enjoying writing the code. The reason, I'm constantly having to guess about whether or not the code I'm writing is actually useful or not. Every time I write a new method signature I have to try and imagine the whole system that's involved for that feature and figure out where this little bit that I'm working on fits in. It's a lot of mental work compared to the alternative. Working outside in you never have to think about the big picture, that's where you started, all you have to do is keep drilling down into the detail until it works. There's no room for drift, if you're disciplined you can always do a minimal amount of work to get the job done. Thinking about code in this way, one little bit at a time is so relaxing. Get interrupted, that's fine, go off fix the urgent bug or whatever. When you return just your tests, see where you got to and pick up where you left off. Because you've externalised your thinking so far you don't need to carry it around in your head. You're back in flow in a couple of minutes.<p>tldr, BDD can make coding a far more relaxing experience whilst helping you focus on adding value, not waste.",1298213551

Tossing TDD/BDD out the window because you believe it's slowing you down is a mistake.

Even your startup's prototypes, quickly hacked together, should at some level meet that criteria.<p>If you're writing code, you have an intention for it, a purpose, and that can be tested on some level or another. It's hard to make an argument that manually clicking around in your browser after writing your implementation is superior to having some form of automated tests in place beforehand.<p>If you're in the exploratory stage of a startup, you'll pivot often, and you'll be building a lot of throwaway prototypes. You should limit the depth of your test coverage, but you can still do TDD. Just don't be strict about it. Not every method/class/behaviour needs to be tested. You may not know the broad direction your software is going in.

2241931,comment,2240595,2240826,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"One of the problems I face as coach is that people ask me simple, yes/no questions and I always answer ""it depends"". It's not that I'm trying to be evasive, it's just that life is full of little complexities. So I took a bit of artistic license and made a generalization. As you point out, we could speculate all day on various scenarios where TDD/BDD might be useful. That line of reasoning was too much for a short comment on HN, though.<p>One of the things I really don't think you get -- something I had an extremely difficult time getting -- is just how worthless your code is. <i>Startups are not rewarded for writing good, maintainable code</i>. Hell, they're not even rewarded for writing code at all. There's a lot of folks that say to advertise, create a vapor-ware product, and only once you know for sure people are willing to pay money for it should you start programming. Whether you like that idea or not, it shows just how far down the line programming is in the scheme of things for a startup. ""Maintainable"" or ""Great"" code is even further down.<p>Startups are about making things that people want that can scale out to huge numbers. Coding gives you that ability to scale out -- in certain instances and under certain situations. But you could just as easily write 10 lines of javascript and make a million dollars as you could write 100K lines of C. In fact, there's another huge school of thought that says the more you code the farther you've probably drifted in your mind from where the actual market might be. Each little test you create is further reinforcing in your mind -- that little code->yay cycle -- that what you are doing is cool. And it's probably not. ""Yay"" is people paying you money. Not having a test run.<p>And that gets to <i>agile principles</i>, which I think are very applicable. Do a little, test the market. Do a little more, test the market. I have been doing that for a few months, and I've found that most people who want stuff could care less whether it involves programming or not, or how well it's programmed. They just want stuff. If a guy is drowning, he's perfectly happy with you throwing him a life saver that falls apart and is crappy -- as long as it saves him from drowning. You might not even need a lifesaver -- you could do something else. In fact, the more you speculate on what the drowning guy might need, the more off-course you are. That means that <i>any</i> structure you put in your code early on is smoke and based on pipe dreams. The iterate-test cycle for me is what has verified beyond a doubt how low on the totem pole programming is. Find something people want. Period. More customers, less anything else.<p>Coming from many years of loving to learn how to be a better craftsman with my code, kinda sucks, huh? All those guys telling you what a great programmer is and how to be one, and then Average Joe Sixpack doesn't recognize how cool your TDD and programming language are. Dang customers. :)",1298212749

They've got very different models, but each has company for theirs.  (Not that it's easy to break in, but it's also really hard to break in to traditional publishing.)  It's very strange to say that people can't make a living writing on line, while ignoring the folks who are actually doing it.<p>Worse is this:  ""If the future is one in which writers are not paid, then it also is one in which writers lack clout. And if it’s a future in which writers lack clout, then what we have is a lack, basically, of an intellectual middle class. Instead we have a sort of volunteer intellectual class, which in terms of clout starts to resemble peasants.""<p>What gives writers clout, at a social level, is that <i>people are reading their stuff, and taking it seriously</i>, for reasons that may have nothing to do with the size of their paycheck.  In the tech corner of the world, The GNU Manifesto and The Cathedral and the Bazaar are both essays that had a huge influence, and not because of how much either author got (belatedly) paid.

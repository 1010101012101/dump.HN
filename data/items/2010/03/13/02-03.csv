When you decided (almost out of the blue) to turn it into a strictly money making venture for yourself I felt burned. I thought you were following in the footsteps of Charlie Rose's interviews, Paul Graham's essays, or one of the dozens of great Podcasts that exist. Something fairly altruistic that may generate money for you, but not as its primary goal. ...""</i><p>I agree with you about charging but these things cost. Plus Andrew is in this to make something users want (and can pay for). My own view is the way Mixergy set up now, you can view the latest for free but historical views cost. Here is a question though. It's related to startups and converting users from free to paying.<p>Do you think Andrew would benefit from a freemium approach where users have some, but limited access before payment is required? (more than now?) Or would some sort of token, voucher for HN followers be enough to avoiding negative early adopters?",1268449051

Checkout my friends dropshipped-powered site <a href=""http://seriouslyscuba.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seriouslyscuba.com</a> - also inspired by Tim Ferriss' muse concept. If I were you I would quickly move away from wp-commerce into a real e-commerce solution (seriouslyscuba is on shopify by the way, so I guess you'd have to justify spending money on their high fees to go that route). The design looks good overall, I guess to me, its just that wordpress doesn't make for a good e-commerce solution. I'd hide the Categories block, RSS links, 'Comments are closed' text, i.e. anything that makes it looks like a blog-converted-to-store. Good luck nonetheless.",1268448713

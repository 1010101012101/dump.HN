In those days as a PC hardware enthusiast and someone who was just beginning to use GNU/Linux, I felt I fit in with the culture fairly well. Of course, there was always &quot;shitposting,&quot; but I found the amount of garbage to be tolerable.<p>As I finished high school and started diving more deeply into GNU/Linux, reading /g/ slowly became less and less enjoyable. At one point, I became so jaded that I felt I understood rms&#x27;s famous quote regarding /g/: 
&quot;I tried to look at that page but saw online inane comments.&quot; I guess I wasn&#x27;t as much of a fan of the battlestations, rms memes, desktops, and riced-out GNU/Linux desktops as I previously was.<p>However, /g/&#x27;s influence on me will never be lost. Even after reading more and more hacker news, I still prefer the anonymous style of posting. I say GNU/Linux instead of Linux. (It may be a bit ironic that I learned about rms through a forum where he is a meme that is usually portrayed negatively.) And, to be be honest, I still kind of like battlestation threads (though I may read more usesthis.com instead of /g/). I will also probably never buy any apple products.<p>Thank you to whomever posted this on /g/, as it really opened my eyes as to how large the intersection of these two communities really is.

It is perpetually displaying some Windows dialog about the advertising program they have installed has failed/ab-ended in some manner. Seriously, I&#x27;m not sure the display has ever worked correctly (I go there a lot.)<p>However, I watched the crew on a Virgin America flight announce that we had to &quot;reboot&quot; the plane because the entertainment system was frozen. It was, and everyone could see it -- it was Linux-based (not certain which flavor, pretty sure it was Debian-based though.) It had frozen, and all the screens (one for every seat) had a console stuck in some batch job and displaying the output to the screen.

I know it is difficult to know how much these merchant accounts get used without internal information from the providers themselves, but from all internal accounts I have heard, the usage is dismal. For no surprising reason customers are generally disinterested in purchasing anything with Bitcoin that they can already purchase with their credit card.<p>I think Bitcoin is going to be revolutionary but the application is lacking - entrepreneurs really need to find a real world application where the use of Bitcoin actually <i>improves</i> the experience.

Counter example: I&#x27;m internet-buddies with a person who goes by CUNT&#x27;N&#x27;PASTE.

I want to add a comment there, but I have a policy of not commenting on sites which require accounts.  I made an account to post this, but the HN thread disabled comments from new users.  4chan stuff seriously shouldn&#x27;t be posted here and will just lead to more trolling, racism/sexism, and a general degradation in quality and more work for moderators.<p>Hi HN. I actually started that thread on /g/. I think it&#x27;s hilarious and somewhat sad that it got cross-posted here. Chan culture is a really weird thing, and (usually) it only makes sense in that context. The fact that people here seem interested seems to indicate a couple different things. The first being that there are a non-trivial number of 4chan users on HN, and that is amusing. The other thing it indicates, though, is that enough people here are amused by the parody of &quot;startup speak&quot; that they want to see jokes about it here. Stop that.<p>4chan is a total shithole. I go there to shitpost, troll, and generally let off some steam. I love/hate it, but these things should not bleed over into sites like HN. The fact that people are upvoting this and taking it at all seriously is an indication that this site is becoming more and more &quot;redditized.&quot; It also may be an indication that the comment system here does not allow for enough free expression, thus people upvote stuff like 4chan threads which express feelings people have but can&#x27;t necessarily say. Then again, maybe the comment system here is part of the reason why comments aren&#x27;t full of &quot;memes&quot;, lame jokes, and racist vitriol like most other sites.<p>Doesn&#x27;t it bother any fellow channers to see this on a &quot;real&quot; website? To the person who posted it here specifically, what were you hoping to gain by posting that thread here? Are you new, friend?<p>The insular culture at HN is weird and, at times, frustrating, and it would be interesting to see some actual analysis of it (or how internet communities evolve culture over time in general). But who the fuck cares what 4chan thinks about anything? What does it say about HN that some random 4chan thread gets tons of upvotes?<p>The internet is weird.",1384674243

I simply cannot independently disable the latter, and my data leaks across the services.<p>I&#x27;ve consequently been experimenting with setting up hostfile blocks of various Google services.

6748005,comment,6745011,6745352,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Some believe that the rise in gluten sensitivity may be due to the hybridization of wheat. In general our entire <i>approach</i> to food has become heavily industrialized. Not that hybridization wasn&#x27;t used in the past, but we are seeing a scale and pace of change in our food supply that is unprecedented.<p>For instance, I think that one thing we are not considering enough is the effect of GMOs in our food supply. Certain foods that we eat in abundance (either directly or in packaged foods), like soy, corn, canola, etc. are almost all GMO.<p>These are unnatural and have never existed in any prior civilization&#x27;s diets. Further, when I look at the timelines you laid out, we are talking changes that occured over hundreds of years. While that is still a short period in terms of human history, the introduction of GMO is happening on an even shorter arc. In other words, we are making dramatic changes to our diet nearly overnight.<p>We know that GMOs have caused allergies in some. There is very definitely a response. And, given what we know about inflammation and its role in disease, it has to make you wonder whether these foreign substances are impacting more people than we think.<p>And, GMOs are just one aspect of dramatic, rapid changes in the modern food supply. We are not even considering processed foods, etc.<p>So, when I read an article like this one, I have to wonder if the elephant in the room is being ignored.

6747994,comment,6746731,6746731,15,0,spenvo,,,"A comment I left a few weekends ago, which addressed the same topic but before the Youtube/G+ story broke: [0]<p>&quot;Hijacking the top comment to talk about a big concern I have. This EFF article argues that there&#x27;s a place for Anonymity on the Internet [1], and I think most of us agree (especially if we emphathize with those in Iran, China, Syria, and the like).<p>But what HNers must realize is the following: The mainstream Internet <i>can not become</i> the Tor-visited Dark-Net (which restores anonymity) that many believe is inevitable WITHOUT losing its positive sociological impact. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, even HN rely on anonymity and also provide a great deal of such value.  Here&#x27;s a simple example of &#x27;sociological impact&#x27;: CNN (FoxNews, etc) pays attention to what the top links on Reddit are, because the site is in the public&#x27;s face -- and: the people have a collective voice.<p>Next: Without the perception of anonymity, sites like Reddit will stop flourishing.<p>Let&#x27;s go deeper:  Reddit&#x27;s culture thrives on &quot;anonymity&quot; in the form of throwaway accounts and people being themselves without representing themselves.  Throwaway accounts (heard of &#x27;Cation Bot&#x27; or &#x27;AWildSketchAppeared&#x27;?) are a form of expression unique to environments which allow for anonymity (pseudonyms). Who&#x27;s to say novelty accounts would be as risque or hilarious without anonymity?  Certainly these sites flourish because users feel comfortable playing a part and taking a chance.<p>There are two issues at play which threaten anonymity on Reddit. Now obvious (in light of Snowden&#x27;s leaks): 1.) Reddit usernames can, and probably are, being mapped to peoples&#x27; actual identity. ... Not as obvious: 2.) Users&#x27; up and down votes, even private messages, can also be sniffed with ease.<p>Reddit&#x27;s&#x27; devteam has retreated from the idea of providing HTTPS for its voting/web API [2], so people&#x27;s actions (aside from comments) can be mapped as well. I tried to raise awareness of this issue five months ago [3].  I know there&#x27;s an argument to be made that SSL/HTTPS is useless anyway (just use Tor!, they say), but the bigger question remains:<p>Can a mainstream community such as Reddit exist in tomorrow&#x27;s Internet?  I&#x27;d say that such web-societies are fragile -- likely targets of dragnet surveillance and subversion, especially given their disruptive nature.<p>People and the press are paranoid about Facebook/Google privacy because its users (are encouraged to) identify themselves <i>explicitly</i>, but the reality is no different with sites like Reddit - just the perception. Just think about how much more is shared on a site like Reddit by its members because of their pseudonyms! Few people aside from the avid Tor-using//r/netsec crowd have realized this.<p>Reddit is the internet &quot;as we know it,&quot; and I feel the Internet is about to change.<p>In hindsight - Google&#x27;s initial &quot;no pseudonyms&quot; policy for Google+ was prescient -- though the company eventually capitulated to popular demand for them. [4] Perhaps they wished to save each of us the unsavory realization that aliases exist in name-only (pun intended). :/&quot;<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6652909\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6652909</a>\n[1] <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-only-trolls-and-political-dissidents\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/online-anonymity-not-o...</a> \n[2] <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/l4n6y/reddit_change_log_in_with_ssl_javascript_fixes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/l4n6y/reddit_chan...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit_needs_fullsite_https/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n73s0/again_reddit...</a> [4] <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-aliases-399584\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ibtimes.com/google-allowing-nicknames-pseudonyms-...</a>",1384673439

6747955,comment,6746312,6746312,4,0,SolarNet,,,"I would like to argue for the surveillance state, or at least government cameras recording all public actions.<p>Consider what it means to be in public. If you are in public you are giving up your implicit right to privacy relating to being viewed or overheard (and depending on jurisdiction, recorded without permission). I would argue that it is perfectly reasonable for the government to have as many cameras as they want in public spaces, with a few caveats:<p>* The data from the cameras should be publicly available. Probably not in real time (or with the option for the temporary disabling of real time by law enforcement until after whatever they disabled it for has ended (with obvious common sense restrictions, like maximum 48 hour delay)).<p>* This would require changes to laws, and society, about how illegal certain types of information is (information should not be inherently illegal) because anyone would be able to put anything on the public cameras, and to prevent cover-ups the data must always be there, even if horrendous and despicable (see: child rape, which is then child porn).<p>* The government has to respect the privacy of private property. Obviously businesses (with public areas) may prefer the government to invade their privacy for the protection they get. But people should be able to request movement (or removal of areas being recorded) of camera&#x27;s view.<p>People will have to accept that being in public means potentially being recorded, and laws must adjust to fit that. There isn&#x27;t a way around it if we like being able to take pictures, and recording ourselves. Other people will become recorded. Allowing the government to do it is a logical legal extension.<p>Consider what this enables, and what we already have which mimics it, by accepting this we acknowledge the reality, and don&#x27;t deny what can already happen. And then consider what this enables that we already don&#x27;t have. In the end public cameras are just another piece of automation:<p>* Following people&#x27;s movements, and interactions, in public areas. We can already do this by tailing people. However currently it requires quite a lot of man power to do it (governments or corporations). With cameras anyone can do it, with some facial recognition software it becomes completely automated. You or I can see where any CEO goes, who they talk to, etc. Of course it can also be done to stalk people more easily (not that it&#x27;s currently hard).<p>* Recording people&#x27;s conversations in public areas. We can do this with a directional microphone, or a well placed bug.<p>* Every violent crime committed in public is easy to solve. This is reason we are installing them in the first place. We can&#x27;t do this currently. But with this we can make it so it applies to police officers as well.<p>* Real-time world analysis. The start of Ubiquitous computing[1]. We don&#x27;t have this at all for now. We can tell where there is heavy traffic. Follow a protest. See the weather at an exact location. I&#x27;m sure some startups could do great things.<p>So the next time you call your congressman, or discuss issues like this. Consider offering the compromise of making the recording public. It can also allow you to bring up the issues of illegal information (for example illegal primes are a good example of why it&#x27;s ridiculous) or that there is no expectation of privacy in public.<p>Besides it would give us a good excuse to have punk hairstyles (<a href=\"http://cvdazzle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cvdazzle.com/</a>).<p>[1]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing</a>",1384672357

If the Russians wanted to do SIGINT, they wouldn&#x27;t announce where they&#x27;re putting their gear; they would load a van up with a couple hundred thousand dollars worth of RF equipment and position near their targets.<p>To give you an idea of reference stations in the US for the GPS system, head on over to: <a href=\"http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS_Map/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS_Map/</a><p>Granted, these are used for post-processing position data for increased accuracy, and not for updating mission-critical orbit/atmospheric error data, but the principal is the same.",1384672060

People do it because being able to push somebodies emotions one direction or another lets them play with that person like a marionette.  Making people upset is a power trip for trolls.<p>It would not suprise me if many (not most by any means, but many) trolls are in fact psychopaths who are &#x27;practicing&#x27; in a way.

However, you can now easily spot preteen girls if you were looking for that specific demographic, and then subscribe to them for more efficient creeping.<p>Shame on Google.

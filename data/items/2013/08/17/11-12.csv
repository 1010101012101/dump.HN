Domestic matters are the FBI&#x27;s territory.  The NSA is tasked with strictly foreign surveillance.  If information is contained in databases that correspond to your communiques, it is not catalogued as &quot;Kevin Collier&quot;, because that would be a direct FISA violation and trigger administrative removal of the data along with reporting about how the violation occurred.<p>2.  I can almost say with complete confidence that our national security resources aren&#x27;t being used to target white suburban bloggers.<p>3.  By flooding NSA public relations with these useless requests, you&#x27;re blocking potentially real requests from being processed.

I should mention he used to work on dialogue systems full time, and has a better grasp on the area than I do. I&#x27;ve basically decided to take the tool approach first: let&#x27;s just get a Siri-like domain done for our IDE, we aren&#x27;t writing code but at least we can access secondary dev functions via a secondary interface (voice, conversation). The main problem getting started is that tools for encoding domains for dialogue systems are very primitive (note that even Apple&#x27;s Siri isn&#x27;t open to new domains).<p>The last person to take a serious shot at this problem was Hugo Liu at MIT. Alexander Repinning has been looking at conversational programming as a way to improve visual programming experiences; this doesn&#x27;t include natural language conversation, but the mechanisms are similar.",1376740379

This is relatively straightforward to accomplish using closures/high order functions. This is one utility function you write once.<p>Finally you can do this with a whole &quot;monadic&quot; api such as jquery- create a function that loops through all the methods on an object prototype and wraps them in an error handler, returns a new version of the prototype you can inherit from.<p>Or instead of doing all that, you just use some library with promises (such as Q, or jQuery) that implements all the above, and all you need to do is write a single error handler function, and any error that gets thrown by any function in a promise chain gets caught and sent to that function.",1376739642

6228778,comment,6228586,6228586,4,0,mattmanser,,,"/rant<p>Contrary to what Scott&#x27;s saying here, I think the ASP.Net team have gone far too far down the rabbit hole.<p>I was doing an interview a few weeks back and part of the interview was a technical test to code up a little website. I&#x27;d never actually created a new project using VS 2012, just an accident of history. Part of it was an admin interface to show the files in the project.<p>So a few minutes later, fire up the new admin page and boom, a colossal amount of random js files, css files, etc. that had been &#x27;helpfully&#x27; added to the project. Both of us were perplexed at what the sheer quantity of crap that had been added.<p>It&#x27;s just got a little silly now. When MVC came out it was great because it didn&#x27;t include much baggage, the only slight annoyance was the MS-WEMUSTDOEVREYTHINGSUPERFORMALLY-SPEAK written AccountController.<p>Now it&#x27;s just, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, remove reference, remove reference, remove reference. No I don&#x27;t want to use &#x27;unobtrusive&#x27; javascript, a term invented to fix a problem only you caused because you really can&#x27;t write javascript. In fact I don&#x27;t want you to create anything at all javascript related thanks. And I pretty much ignore most of your HTML binders because you&#x27;re not very good at HTML either.<p>And <i>if</i> I want to use jQuery UI, which will usually only be for the datepicker, I really don&#x27;t need all those other jQuery UI files do I? They even know they&#x27;ve included too much as they try and hide it all in folders.<p>And who&#x27;s bright idea was it to include Modernizr? It&#x27;s not going to be needed unless you&#x27;re in the tiny amount of MS web developers who actually code for public websites using HTML5, compared to the massive amount of developers coding internal websites on a full MS stack where some people are stuck on IE8 as they&#x27;re still on XP.<p>The people who need it are going to know about it, so why add it in the first place?<p>Or start with an empty project and then have to cut and paste a bunch of stuff you actually need.<p>And every version they seem to change their mind where the damn error catchers are going to be. And still not work properly, rely on redirections, etc. Gah.<p>There&#x27;s a happy medium which they seem to be having an extremely hard time getting to. Or I have OCD about pointless code files that I&#x27;m not using. Probably the latter and I&#x27;m a small minority of getting frustrated with it.<p>/rant<p>I guess at least it&#x27;s not as bad as before NuGet where they&#x27;d include a version of jQuery which was immediately out of date.",1376738042

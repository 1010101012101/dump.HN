Carbonite has no effective technological security, so you'd better hope that nobody breaks into their offices, none of their employees ""go bad"", and they're never confronted by a subpoena or have the PATRIOT act invoked against them; and they only keep the latest version of any file, so if you ever accidentally mangle a file you'd better hope that you can retrieve the unmangled version before Carbonite backs up the mangled version and throws away the older copy.",1184845559

If I give up 6% of my company, it costs me 6% of any MONEY I might end up getting, but it doesn't cost me 6% of the UTILITY.  If I have a utility-of-money function of sqrt($), you don't have to increase my chance of success by 6.4%; it's enough if you increase my chance of success by 3.2%.\n",1184844608

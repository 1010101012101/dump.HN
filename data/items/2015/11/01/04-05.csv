He hated it because not only did it not do the Germans justice for being excellent soldiers, it also didn&#x27;t do the Americans justice for being able to take out this difficlt foe.

But due to throughput issues in some situations, they switched to a new architecture a few years ago called &#x27;io-pkt&#x27;. This is essentially the kernel networking code from BSD transplanted to a process in QNX; one advantage of this is that there&#x27;s a large stock of drivers available to port and a lot of people are familiar with the BSD networking model, but some of the lesser-used corners of it weren&#x27;t fully debugged when I was doing network protocol hacking, and in general it made me sad.<p>Anyway, you can definitely run full desktop environments on it, and you can especially run a full <i>tablet</i> environment if you buy a recent Blackberry tablet, as RIM now owns QNX and uses it as their latest Blackberry OS.

That Newton 140 years earlier could pull this off, and it&#x27;s not like he had vague ideas which we understand today well and just attribute to him -- no, he got the laws and the maths precisely.<p>It is a whole another thing that his work is incredibly hard to understand today mostly because we learn calculus as Cauchy and Weierstrass laid it down.

America&#x27;s first battle in Africa was a huge casualty (echoes the stuff in the movie Fury). Of course no one is born out to succeed, but the truth is thousands died on the path to victory.<p>Korean and Chinese had been fighting the Japanese long before Germany declaring war in Europe, way before 1937. For more than a decade, the Chinese had been fighting alone (well with very unpleasant support from the Western civilization like getting weapons at a very expensive rate and siding with the Japanese). Everyone else was still supplying industrial material to Japan, aiding and helping killing millions in Southern-Asia, because the rest of the world wanted to stay neutral. If the Chinese didn&#x27;t hold back the Japanese, the entire Southern Asia would have fall in the hand of Japan in a few months (what the Japanese generals had promised their emperor). The British and the French armies did not stand a chance in their colonines against the Japanese.<p>Soon May-in, First Lady of Republic China came to the U.S. and begged the U.S. Congress to help China [1]. I quote: &quot;When Japan thrust total war on China in 1937 military experts of every nation did not give China even a ghost of a chance. But when Japan failed to bring China cringing to her knees as she vaunted, the world took solace in this phenomenon by declaring that they had overestimated Japanâs military might.&quot;<p>It wasn&#x27;t until late in the war did the Chinese receive air support (and many kind volunteers from the U.S. Army such as the Flying Tigers group) to help stabilize the war against Japan in China. But millions, were poured into the battlefield, untrained, uneducated, with little armor, fought against a modernized elite army from Japan.<p>Oh not to mention the shitty Commander Stilwell who caused a huge causality of the allies in the Southern-Pacific/Burma...don&#x27;t get me started there. The British hated him. The Chinese hated him (he seized control of an elite Chinese army division and lost 60% of them - that division stayed and fought the Japanese so hard the Japanese had to surrender).<p>We had lost so many lives in WWII, including tens of thousands of American (some were recruited from U.S. territories that still don&#x27;t have voting right in the Congress!). We can definitely improve history class by not just always focusing on American&#x27;s effort. Even the local rebels in Europe helped the Allies to finish missions. Intelligence that the Chinese had provided to the Allies regarding the Japanese had helped Allies in attacking Japanese later in the war.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://china.usc.edu/soong-mei-ling-%E2%80%9Caddresses-house-respresentatives-and-senate%E2%80%9D-february-18-1943"" rel=""nofollow"">http://china.usc.edu/soong-mei-ling-%E2%80%9Caddresses-house...</a><p>-- edit --<p>For those who can comprehend Mandarin, you can watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30QQtJoJ9Zg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30QQtJoJ9Zg</a> (and other episodes).",1446351363

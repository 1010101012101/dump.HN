I don't think anything further then that is appropriate or helpful.  Everything after that is just gossip.  I'd be interested to hear how the OP feels in retrospect, and if spreading this around helped even slightly.  I would doubt it, but I'd be happy to be proven wrong.  I think it's important to remember that the Internet is not real life.  It is fantasy.  How else do you explain lulz?",1236895129

514159,comment,513766,514086,0,0,katz,,,"> I've attended a lecture by John Raven, the publisher of that test, and he doesn't make that claim.<p>I never said that he made that claim. Several other people compared RAPM and other intelligence tests to determine the g-loading. It was found by other people (not Dr. Raven) that RAPM has a high g loading. Testing for the general intelligence factor and the use of RAPM is widely accepted. Here is an example of a recent article: “Just one g: consistent results from three test batteries”, (Wendy Johnson, Thomas Bouchard, etc...) 2004. Using Google scholar you can find several other results. Even if you reject RAPM as a measure of g, there are less g-loaded tests (such as IQ) that can be used that predicts more or less the same thing (heritability of intelligence, etc...).<p>> The long, careful examination of what the Raven tests show, in conjunction with other evidence, can be found in James R. Flynn's excellent book What Is Intelligence?, which is about to come out in a new, expanded edition.<p>My problem with most of Flynn's books is that he is a political scientist and a passionate left-wing campaigner. He is basically a Gould-light – distorting science to fit his own world view.<p>I usually prefer to read papers or books on intelligence matters from people with a PhD in  areas such as educational psychology or neurology when it concerns brain structure (e.g. prof. Haier).",1236894366
514158,comment,513472,513472,0,0,swombat,,,"Actually, I would say that the very first example is the correct organisation with proper separation of concerns. The reason they are often merged into the form of the second code sample is for convenience rather than for organisation. From a code design perspective, this is not a good thing (and I know many people who complain that Rails made a mistake with that). From a testing perspective, for instance, the coupling between the User object, the methods that save and load that object from the db, and the validation code, make it much harder to write cleanly isolated tests.<p>There are plenty of architectures where ""data objects"" are dumb and are passed to more intelligent objects that can save them, serialize them, etc.<p>MMM|VVV|CCC is a better system than MVC|MVC|MVC because it encourages separation of concerns, and loose coupling between concerns. Tight coupling between mostly unrelated pieces of functionality (why should the persistence code know anything about the controller?) is a very nasty code smell.",1236894303

So it buys us 160 hours of extra evening light. (I'm not counting weekends, because then the distinction between the hour lost of morning light and that gained of evening light is immaterial.) That means we're paying $0.01 each per hour of evening light. I'll take that deal.<p>In truth, I find that DST sucks for about 3 days, but after I've adjusted, I'm very glad it's there.

When they follow up with, ""Like what?""  The response is ""Mostly porn.""  If they take me seriously, they're probably not going to get the real explanation, anyway, so I have a little fun with the porn explanation, making it more and more outlandish until they realize I'm joking.  I often tell myself that this is merely for amusement, and that what I actually do for a living is not far more embarrassing (due to being really boring to most people) than running a porn empire.<p>Other technology people, ""I started a company that builds systems management software for web hosting.""<p>Regular folks, ""Computer stuff.""  Very similar to vasudeva's response.  The only flaw in this tactic is that every once in a while, you'll meet someone who <i>also</i> does ""computer stuff"" (or their nephew or son or cousin does), and they'll want to ""talk shop"" about their website where they sell their knitted dog hats, or whatever MLM scheme they've most recently signed up for that includes a website.  Or ask me ridiculous questions about hacking GMail or facebook or something equally retarded (depending on age and demographic).",1236891972

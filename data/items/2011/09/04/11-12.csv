Of these, only the last one is relative to the reference frame. Temporal ordering of events is absolute for events that are causally related, if event A is in the past of event B, which is <i>defined</i> as event B being able to observe event A or any of its consequences, then event A happens before event B in every frame of reference. Only the time difference between A and B depends on the frame of reference (for an observer at rest relative to the microwave background, there are 21 million years between the supernova and our observation of it, but a neutrino emitted by the nova passes though the earth only moments after it was created in its own reference frame, as it travels almost at the speed of light relatie to the nova and the earth). Likewise, we say that B is in the future of A if B can observe A or any of its consequences.<p>Only in the case that neither A can observe B nor B can observe A, which we denote by saying that the events are in their relative present, the ordering becomes relative to the frame of refrence, but that case is irrelevant in the present discussion, as we <i>can</i> observe the nova and so have established the fact that it (or at least its beginning) is in our past. Note that its maximum, which is predicted to be observable around next friday, is in our present (we can not influence nor observe it yet), while our observation of it is in our future (we can still make plans for where to watch it), at least until next friday, when both of these events simultaneously move into our past.",1315137558

Later it was claimed this was a first draft with incorrect information.<p><a href=""http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=26626"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=26626</a><p>I don't think it really matters exactly what happened, I only brought it up because I wanted to point out that I felt that he was a tough and very aware individual.<p>Possibly relevant:<p>Excerpt from ""Year to the Twin Towers Disaster"" Yediot Ahronot, Seven Days Magazine Section 6 September 2002. Translation by IMRA:<p>""Danny Lewin was the first victim of the biggest attack in history that morning, in which almost 3,000 people died. An internal memorandum of the Federal Aviation Administration sets that in the course of a struggle that took place between Lewin, a graduate of Israel's elite commando unit, Sayeret Matkal , and the four hijackers who were assaulting that cockpit, Lewin was murdered by Satam Al Suqami, a 25 year old Saudi.<p>Some time after the attack the Lewin family in Jerusalem received a telephone call from the FBI offices in New York. On the line was the agent responsible for the investigation of the attack on Flight 11. He told Peggy and Charles Lewin that there is a high degree of certainty that their son Danny tried to prevent the hijacking. The FBI relied, among other things, on the testimony of the stewardess Amy Sweeney.<p>Sweeney called Michael Woodward, the flight services supervisor in Boston, from the rear of the plane: ""a hijacker slit the throat of a passenger in business class and the passenger appears to me to be dead."" To this day the American investigators are not convinced that Danny Lewin was murdered on the spot. An additional stewardess, Betty Ong, who succeeded in calling from a telephone by one of the passenger seats, said that the passenger who was attacked from business class seat 10B was seriously wounded.<p>The Lewin family, Danny' parents and brothers, have no doubt that Danny battled the hijackers. And it is for them a tremendous consolation. ""I wasn't surprised to hear from the FBI that Danny fought. I was sure that this is what he would do,"" Yonatan, his younger brother, said. ""Danny didn' t sit quietly. From what we heard from the Americans, the hijackers attacked one of the stewardesses and Danny rose to protect her and prevent them from entering the cockpit. It is a consolation to us that Danny fought. We see it as an act of heroism that a person sacrifices his life in order to save others. An act of heroism that everyone should do at such an instance and particularly suitable for Danny.""<p>That battle in the business section ended quickly. Lewin was overcome and bled to death on the floor. Two additional flight attendants were knifed and the captain was murdered. The hijackers were already inside the cockpit. They announced to the passengers to remain quiet in their seats.<p>Also there is this:<p>But a childhood friend who served with Lewin in the Israel Defense Force says only a bullet would have stopped Lewin.<p>""He'd be more than a match for those skinny little (expletive),"" said Brad Rephen, a New York lawyer who grew up with Lewin in Jerusalem. ""With his training, he would have killed them with his bare hands.""<p>""I can tell you, their knives would not have stopped him,"" he added. ""He would have taken their knives or their box cutters away and used them against them.""<p>Rephen recalls Lewin's injured hands after he returned from an Israeli anti-terrorist training course.<p>""They were pretty beaten up from the fighting he did,"" he said. ""He knew how to fight with knives and take knives away from people.""<p>He described Lewin, at about 5-11, 200 pounds, as ""thick-boned."" He says he witnessed him bench-press more than 300 pounds and squat close to 500 pounds.<p>""He was very, very strong and had a lot of meat on him,"" Rephen said. ""They couldn't have subdued him by slashing him. The only way they could have stopped him was by shooting him.""<p><a href=""http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=13281"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=13281</a>",1315136193

2959229,comment,2958028,2959166,1,0,Mz,,,"I wasn't trying to convince you of anything.  I was merely trying to communicate that I am, in fact, aware of the point you are making and it in no way changes the point I was making.  Others in this discussion have made the same basic point I was making -- that this is more widespread and relevant than many people seem to think -- without getting downvoted or argued with.  I have no idea why my remarks got such a reaction.  I have no idea what the disconnect is in that regard.<p>I now have a full-time paid job for the first time in my life and I have found that when I talk to people long enough, everyone at work has some issue or other. I have had conversations with someone at work who a) had previously told me they have a medical condition (diabetes) which can be significantly impacted by diet and then b) later essentially expressed pity for me that I must limit my diet as it was something they could not relate to because they ""could eat anything"".  Yeah, they could -- and take drugs to deal with the consequences. Or, with a different mental model, they could be pickier about their diet and take less medication.  They aren't as different from me as they think they are, they simply frame their own issue differently from mine and deal with their problem differently from my approach -- and then they frame themselves in their own mind as ""normal, healthy"" and me as ""handicapped"" when in reality we are both dealing in part with the exact same issue as we both have blood sugar problems.  I have also seen parents admit they have some of the same traits as their kids but they swear they don't have Asperger's while labeling their child as ""having Asperger's"".  Why?  Because it's stigmatizing and would hurt their career to self-identify as a ""handicapped"" person worthy of a label.  Such parents are typically pretty hostile towards me and my attempts to say ""so if you and your child are not so very different, why does the child deserve a stigmatizing label but you do not?""  I have two kids who both fit the profile for ASD.  I do not say they ""have Asperger's"".  For one thing, that makes as much sense to me as saying ""they have male"" or ""they have Caucasian"".  No, they <i>are</i> male and they <i>are</i> Caucasian and they fit the profile for certain traits that some people would give the label ""Asperger's Syndrome"".  Not labeling them or stigmatizing them has been a significant part of how I have helped them learn to play to their strengths and accommodate their weaknesses without winding up mentally and logistically trapped into being ""the pathetic handicapped person"".<p>Personal limitations are very widespread.  We all have them.  As we grow older, we tend to acquire more of them.  Making things more generally usable is not really about jumping through hoops to make big accommodations for a small number of people.  And when people finally wrap their brain around that and do something about it, it begins bringing down barriers in a way which allows ""handicapped"" people to live more normally without anyone focusing on their handicap.  Yes, some handicaps, like being blind, won't be as easily remedied or readily supported as others.  But vision problems are more widespread than people seem to think.  And making things visually accessible tends to also benefit ""normal"" people who don't particularly think of themselves as ""handicapped"".<p>Thanks for asking. I hope that is clearer to you but I really don't understand what the disconnect is so I am not confident it is.<p>Peace.",1315135186

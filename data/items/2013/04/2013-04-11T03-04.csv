I think it will never appeal to classic / professional musicians or anyone who already feels comfortable with the regular notation, but for people lbike me, that for whatever neurological reason just can get the old notation to stick, this is priceless. The Above Below C Dot Empty Full Groove is such a great wiring that I will never be able to forget it. I might not read it fast as you read regular notes, but I will at least be able to practice. Reading regular notes to me was always counting lines, always missing the global # or b, and simply giving up serious music. I recorded music, had songs on the radio, I can play anything by ear, but not being able to read notes always bothers me. Now I can.",1365652786

I get recruiter emails from decent companies from time to time and seem to be able to get interviews at most places I apply to, but they are all for full-time work.<p>I would love to find part-time employment so that I can spend my free time on other things than working for someone else.<p>I have started applying and I like to be up-front so in my cover letters I state that I am interested in working no more than 25 hours per week (3 full days). So far, all the responses I've received are rejections from people saying that they require someone who can give a full time commitment to the job.<p>I am not interested in using freelance type sites since I don't feel that I will get market rates (if I am incorrect, please let me know -- but I believe I will never approach Silicon Valley hourly rates doing something like that).<p>In the past I was able to convert one of my full-time jobs to part-time contract work but the company got acquired and I was laid off.<p>A few tangents:<p>1. My goal is to run a self-funded startup and my costs are negligible. The day I have to pay $50 a month for VPS costs because I need to scale up will be a good one.<p>2. I believe that there is plenty of room for useful software in the world that any skilled developer can build and support that can make a more-than-comfortable living.<p>3. I recently registered a domain name and am considering setting up a site which basically amounts to the Canadian Association of Independent Software Professionals. Were this thing in full swing, I could probably find work from others on the site already. Any interest in such a thing?<p>4. I refuse to go into debt to fund my startup. It's just not in my nature and I don't see myself looking for funding when the costs are so low.",1365652771

We'd take the robots away on a field trial - no internet access - fix some bugs, write some code, add some features.<p>That's five to ten people, all writing code that interacts with each other's, all without any access to the SVN server. You can imagine the copy-pasta that went on. The amount of ""oh fuck, I just rebuilt-all without Dave's changes"". The amount of ""Bags not merging this shit.""<p>Then we'd get back to work after a weekend and have to merge all our independent branches. That could take a day or two on its own. Sometimes, sitting with five people's laptops in front of you and using the human brain's visual diff was more efficient than trying to do it properly.<p>---<p>Now, with git, we push and pull wherever the hell we like as needed.

5529874,comment,5528274,5529676,2,0,zan5hin,,,"This is just painful. Instruments do not have scales. Music is written in different keys, and often modulates to another key and back again during the piece. In order to cover the range of pitches, different clefs are used to make the notation easier to read. Piano music is written in two clefs, bass and treble, centered around ""middle C"". This is called the grand staff. Depending upon an instrument's range different clefs are used. Violoncellos use bass, tenor, and treble clef. Violas use alto clef.<p>Scales are a function that acts upon the set of pitches used in music. A C major scale has the pitches C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. A G major scale (function) has the pitches G, A, B, C, D, E, and F#.<p>""Mapping relative pitches to a scale"" is nonsensical. A scale (function) is an absolute set of pitches, immutable.<p>There are two forms of solfège (do, re, mi, ...): fixed and moveable. In moveable the first pitch of the scale is always do. In fixed the pitch called C is always do. Watch ""The Sounds of Music"" to learn the solfège for a major scale, it's the do-re-mi song. There are other syllables used for the three minor scale forms. To my knowledge (admittedly not complete) Italy, France, and perhaps England used a fixed-do system, whereas the rest of the world uses a moveable-so system.",1365651991

I mean he wasn't able to stop millions of stickers being made depicting Calvin pissing on car logos, but yet he wouldn't allow children to purchase a plush toy of Hobbes? It may be his prerogative, but when something artistic has impacted the lives of millions in such an important way, I believe that artists need to live with the fact that there will be derivative works.  I mean I could argue that Warhol should not have been able to use the Campbell's soup logo based on the same reasoning in this article... I think the pixelation of the original image constitutes a greater abstraction than simply enlarging the image and changing the colors.<p>BTW, I am adopting the term ""meatspace.""

A staff can have 8 32nd notes and then a dotted half note. Those first notes take up 1/4 the time but 3/4 the space.

5529767,comment,5528274,5528274,3,0,plus9z,,,"Funny that I came across this right after a concert (Bottesini, Elgar, Hindemith, Monti, Saint-Saens, and Dvorak -- all 1st movements of one of their respective concertos, except for the Trauermusik -- if you're wondering).<p>So to start off, it's not really a valid criticism to complain about Hummingbird's alleged emphasis on absolute pitches as opposed to relative pitches. Honestly, I can read the notes without giving a crap about note names. I mean, are the circle-names that distracting? The visual position of pitches is still consonant with traditional notation, so it's still maintaining the relative spacing you would expect. Additionally, the new accidentals are at least still on the left where you'd expect them to be.<p>As far as why this is better than the ""teaching notation"" [1] of today, it should be obvious when you zoom out a bit: the current system simply doesn't visually scale. That example's quite difficult to read without looking at staff lines. Reading a letter name from inside a note head is impossible unless you make everything ""Fisher-Price""-sized (i.e. unmanageably huge). I mean, good luck reading this [2] at any distance if it had note names inside. Sure, by the time you get to the point to be able to play that sort of piece you shouldn't need note names, but if we're discussing notation, Hummingbird is definitely better than ""teaching notation"" in that respect.<p>On the other hand, we have some new issues that are introduced:<p>(1) Lack of stems or beams. As others have noted, this really is difficult to use to scan pieces quickly before/during sight-reading. They've missed the point with proportional spacing, because there are pieces with really horrendous spacing that are still actually readable. However, getting rid of beams makes thinking about rhythmic patterns harder, because now you have to look in two places to find rhythm grouping (in their version of ""beams"") and rhythm (with that squiggly crap under the ""note head"").<p>(2) Not to mention, this results in another readability issue when it comes to notes shorter than a quaver (8th-note): scaling. I cannot tell the difference between 16th and 32nd notes when I zoom out even a little; the curves all smoosh together. And WTF is with those rests? They're completely unreadable at the same zoom level. Traditional notation, however, makes things obvious because the flags are a clear indicator of the length of the note. In fact, I can zoom out 8 times farther in traditional notation and see note lengths EASILY.<p>(3) This brings up the issue of lower visual information density. I'm not buying that this will help non-visual learners. I mean, where's the auditory or tactile feedback here? Not to mention, this hampers visual learners too, because traditional notation manages to make all the visual cues large yet it still takes the same amount of space. Hummingbird depends too much on minimalism, and turns fat, thick beams into anemic lines, and heavy, bold accidentals into awkward little markings. I'm not saying that this is an issue that is confined to Hummingbird; badly typeset traditional scores, particularly computer-generated scores, suffer from this as well. I'm saying that at its best, Hummingbird is on the same level with respect to clarity as incompetent traditional typesetting.<p>(4) Why did they get rid of dotted notes? I mean, functionally, a half-note tied to a quarter-note is the same as a dotted half, but notationally, they are used differently. The former would be used in simple duple to represent 1 beat + 1/2 beat, 2 beats + 1 beat, etc. and the latter would function better in simple triple or compound meters, where it might represent a whole measure or a whole beat, respectively. Either way, this type of rhythmic grouping is absent from Hummingbird. I mean, there's a reason why most typesetters don't go around using triple-dotted half notes every time there's a dotted half tied to a dotted eighth; it's less readable.<p>(5) The abstraction in the note names is weird. If you're going to abstract note names, why not just use position? Why do you have to learn a system using circle-symbols that no one uses anyway?<p>(6) Yeah, that key sig thing is really a non-starter. Although I do have memory lapses regarding the key signature at moments, it's still important, for the same reason that knowing harmonic and melodic progressions are important, namely that you know how the notes function in relation to one another in the piece. If you want to scan a piece of music and write a harmony for it, or do anything to it besides just reading it, the key sig is almost a necessity.<p>(7) This might become a non-issue in future versions/revisions, but what about other notation for ornamentations and other musical aspects in general?\nSlurs (look a bit like rests, and violates every sense of notational consistency as a result),\ncertain chords (if you want to typeset two adjacent notes, normally you just shift one note head to one side; Hummingbird makes that impossible),\nmultiple voicings (how do you mark separate voices if you can't use stem direction b/c there are no stems to work with?),\ntrills (not the ""tr"" mark, but the wavy line that sometimes follows or replaces it; looks a bit too much like a bunch of 8th notes tied together),\ntremolos (if there are no flags, how do you write a tremolo?),\nBartok pizzicati (which look remarkably similar to 16th rests and sharp symbols),\ntuplets (how do you express a tuplet if there's no stem? Then the tuplet bracket looks like a beam, and the tuplet number might as well be a fingering),\nacciaccature/appogiature (there is no concept of note size, so notating grace notes is impossible),\nglissandi (they look like beams -- is this getting old?), and\narticulation marks (many of which are too close for comfort to random symbols that I won't bother enumerating here).<p>I mean this huge post is just scratching the surface of the fundamental issues with Hummingbird. By all means, find a way to improve notation, but if the intent is make reading note names easier, don't sacrifice literally everything else. If I was given complete control of Hummingbird, revision 2 would be identical to traditional notation, except for the note heads. Yeah, there would still be scalability issues, but the change wouldn't castrate the notation as a whole, it would allow a very smooth transition to traditional notation, and at the very least those circle things are ignorable by professionals. The final issue, then, is how do you differentiate half notes and quarter notes or tremolos... Ah never mind, it's just a mess already. And don't forget, we have a better two-century old version of this proposal already [3], but some shapes still look a bit too similar to one another...<p>TL;DR Hummingbird is equally fast to read, but is less information-dense and scalable, and invalidates many aspects and necessary facets of current notation, which all combined introduces unnecessary headache for everyone who's not a newb. Can't comment on behalf of the noobs, because it's been a while, and you can't really imagine what it's like to not be able to read notation when you actually can.<p>Also what guy designed those samples with GRAY staff lines? They blend into the white background waaay too easily, and makes Hummingbird harder to read. I mean, that traditional F-C-F quarter note triad looks like an F-(B? or C? or D?)-F triad in Hummingbird.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.14/Documentation/f8/lily-13872c43.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.14/Documentation/f8/lily-13872c43...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/e3/lily-bfe938fb.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/e3/lily-bfe...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note</a>",1365650195

This project is talking about doing one off detonations.<p>Have you heard of a hydrogen bomb?  If they lost energy to creating the fusion in a hydrogen bomb, what would be the point?  If you removed the fusion part of a hydrogen bomb, would you get a bigger explosion?  No.  You get <i>MORE ENERGY</i> using fusion.  However, we don't have a way to harness that to make electricity yet to maintain a steady reaction.  But <i>maintaining a steady reaction is not what this project proposes doing</i>.  Do you get it yet?<p>Edit: smaller explosion -> bigger explosion.  So many explosions.",1365649310
5529720,comment,5528274,5529356,4,0,oblique63,,,"Very much this.  Tradition is a terrible way to measure something's merits.  And even if it did 'work', that's no reason to not try and improve it (though, I'd agree that just throwing something out there that might fragment things isn't terribly helpful either).<p>There are some good things about traditional sheet music notation, but that doesn't take away the fact that it's bloated with historical baggage. It's really not terribly efficient at communicating the 'essence' of music, it's just that we've all gotten used to translating piano notation into practical [insert_your_instrument_here] implementation in our heads. It's neither a useful 'source code' for other instruments to interpret, nor is it an efficient 'byte code' to describe the fundamental elements of music.<p>That's not to say that I have a solution to these problems of course (yet -- been working on my own project for a while that will eventually try to address this), but the issues aren't hard to spot, and they certainly seem like areas that can be optimized. And there will always be the problem of adoption, but I don't think that's even an argument we should bother raising until somebody proposes either a system that's either truly an upgrade, or a system that starts getting so much traction and starts fracturing music notation without any added benefit.<p>Personally, I sympathize with the aims of this project here, and think some of the ideas are clever, but considering how many things it changes, I don't think it really adds much efficiency when parsing/writing it in return.  It actually strikes me as odd why they wouldn't just move to a chromatic grid system if they were getting rid of key signatures, that way they'd just eliminate accidentals all together -- or if not, then just combine them into one, since the key is a big reason for why they even have 2 designations in the first place.  Which brings up the point that those symbols are all really quite complicated to be able to parse very quickly; the controversial 'note names' especially, but the accidentals <i>really</i> did not have much of a reason to be changed other than to just look 'fancier' -- which just makes them harder to parse, and to draw (IMO, but I have terrible hand writing).<p>Oh well, I wish them the best anyway. This isn't a terribly progressive field so I'm just glad to see <i>anything</i> happening.",1365649273

But that [aero/space R&D, not Russia ;)], I can highly recommend.<p>I think actually, a more general advice is to take an internship in any high tech industry area in which a cost of software or design failures is very, very high.",1365649215

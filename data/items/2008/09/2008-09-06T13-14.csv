I was only replying to the ""extraordinary quailty"" statement with my own admittedly anecdotal evidence.<p>And yes, probably what I am seeing is people who feel the same as you where the fit and finish of OSX exceeds their expectations and they are willing to pay more and/or be more forgiving about hardware failures if they happen.  That's their choice, but it's not mine.",1220708944

I know that now, but I don't need to know it since I'm not planning on spending more time investigating it.  I think that's a shame for the both of us.",1220708613

Him 20 years ago would have loved it and contributed a lot - him now would have to either get it back, or sink without a trace.",1220708422

All it can show at this stage is that some folks are running Chrome - wee that is hardly a surprise given the level of interest from software development professionals.",1220708127

If the government would just get out of the way, everything would be roses and flowers in Libertopia"".<p>Left-wingers: ""You're on crack.  This whole thing happened because we need more government regulation.  If we could just get good regulations and put the people in power over greedy multi-national globalized corporate ... (and so on) ... we would be much better off!"".<p>Real-worlders: ""Libertopia is about as likely to work as Marxistan, the system we have is pretty good, but will always need some tweaking.  There is plenty of scope for debate, on a case by case basis, looking at the actual facts and data for each case.  Sometimes we should tack away from regulations, in other cases some government intervention might work to improve markets.  In this case, Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac were probably not that good an idea to begin with.  Oh, and by the way, these sorts of debates probably don't belong on Hacker News;-)""<p>Oh, and by the way, ""wholesale indictment of American capitalism"" is just handwaving.  ""American capitalism"" is an awfully broad range of things, from Joe's Corner Sandwich Shop to Goldman Sachs to, well, Y Combinator.",1220707414

The sound of the cars is a constant. It's not influenced by the subjects nor by external factors. So correlation in this case pretty much indicates causation.",1220706085

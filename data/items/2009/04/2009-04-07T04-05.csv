Other than your idea possibly being a pile of garbage, none of us here know as to the exact reasons you got rejected. Sure, pg will, but I doubt he'll write up a critique of your app and post it publicly. If you want to know why you were rejected, email someone at yc to see if they're even willing to give you feedback.<p>""Maybe we should start a YC-rejected group!!!""<p>Go for it. Honestly, it's a big waste of time. Last year someone created RejectedByYC.com, but that seems to have vanished. I don't really know why you'd want to limit yourself to giving/receiving feedback and support for your project from other YC-rejected companies. The rest of us who got accepted or didn't apply aren't less willing to encourage/support/critique your efforts.<p>""I got rejected, but I'm moving on!!!""<p>Awesome, but really, even considering to discontinue a project based on your YC decision is foolish. Sure, the experience is great, you get a little cash to get you off the ground, but if your motivation was that dependent on the outcome of whether you'd be accepted to YC, you need to realize that there are much higher hurdles to be conquered ahead. Plus, we don't need to know you're moving on. Create something, ask for feedback, and we'll care.<p>""MyStartup (YC reject '09) asking for feedback!!!""<p>Don't label yourself as a YC reject. I don't know why people do this. I am no more interested in your startup whether accepted or rejected from YC. There are several YC companies I think are crap, and many rejects that I think are awesome. I guess what you're trying to get across by labeling yourself as a YC rejects is ""PG thinks we're crap, but I'm out to prove him wrong!"" That makes you seem bitter and unable to emotionally settle with your rejection. We are a community of startups and people interested in them and we need not to label ourselves into various camps. There are startups that are accepted into YC, and for those companies, they were each merely granted an opportunity. For every YC accepted company, there's another who has received angel investing sans incubator-type program, and another who has been hooked up with a client that could bring lots of business, and another that just took vc funding. Starting companies is about finding opportunities. And if YC isn't an opportunity that came your way, you have hundreds of other paths to pursue.<p>I've said this before, but please realize that Digg, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Myspace, eBay, Amazon, PayPal, and 99.999% of the most popular and/or highly valued acquired companies didn't go through YC, nor any other YC-like program.",1239077910

The question in this case is whether Google's product placements on search result pages cause ""consumer confusion."" The distinction between this case and the shop is that, with product placement, according to the court, everyone knows what's going on, so there is no ""consumer confusion."" In contrast, does everyone know that a Google ad resulting from a search may be unrelated to the search? Maybe we HN readers do, but the question is whether the ""average consumer"" would.<p>Nevertheless, the court did not go nearly so far as the above commenter suggested. All it said was that Google's product placements were potentially more confusing than the prior 1-800 case. The product placements might not be confusing nonetheless.",1239077231

550325,comment,547952,548469,0,0,jballanc,,,"Thanks. I'm always game for a good debate. As I mentioned, my thesis-in-progress (T-minus 3 months...fingers crossed!) is in a related field (evolutionary dynamics/computational biochemistry), but I used to be more involved in protein structure/bioinformatics back in the day (worked, for a time, in the lab that maintains ecogene.org).<p>The last debate I had regarding convergent evolution of protein folds got rather heated. This is one of those classic problems that can't be approached without some amount of hand-waving, and depending on which way you wave, you can arrive at different results. In some respects it boils down to Levinthal's paradox, except with evolutionary moves in place of topological ones. The one big unknown that you would need to find before you could make any sort of educated approach at the issue is what fraction of all possible protein chains of a certain size have stable, fast-folding structural minima. If that number is high, then short hops from one to the other could very likely result in convergence.<p>As for the SCOP/PFAM part of the story, the 25-30% ""twilight zone"" for sequences yielding related structures has a counterpart with structures that are topologically related but with low (or I've even seen cases of essentially no) sequence identity. That is, if you look at a group in PFAM, then take all of the members with structures in that group, gather all of the corresponding SCOP groups, add the members from the SCOP groups, then for each of those look for related PFAMs or other sequences...essentially, what you're doing is a structure informed PSI-BLAST (sort of what ESPRESSO is to T-COFFEE).<p>Now, if you attempt to fill the gaps from lack of structures by running each of your sequences through something like Skolnics TASSER threading algorithm, and using the best predicted folds to grow your group, this is how you can use distant sequence and structure homologies to construct ""master"" fold groups. This is, roughly speaking, how the 800-1300 number is arrived at.<p>Admittedly, the more structures we solve and genomes we sequence, the better this sort of technique will get. In many ways, this is biology's analog to cosmology and the big bang: we can look further and further out into space, but at some point, we can know what happened any earlier than some small time after the big bang without recreating those conditions. Likewise, we can sequence and solve more structures, but I don't doubt that at some point we will hit a wall and need to start attempting to recreate abiogenesis.<p>Interesting times!",1239077093

550317,comment,550233,550233,0,0,jmtame,,,"Tips for hacking your speaking skills:<p>1) Most importantly, practice it out loud.  Do it about 20 times and you'll be comfortable enough to deliver it with only glances at note cards.  90% of being nervous comes from not knowing what you're going to do or say.<p>2) Second most important, make it relevant to your audience.  Have you ever tried to carry on a conversation with someone you knew wasn't interested in what you had to say?  It's the only thing that to this day still makes me nervous.  I've given network neutrality speeches to college students in liberal arts programs, and the thing that works here is heavy use of metaphors.  I had the single most attractive girl from class walk up to me at a bar later that week and she told me that she told all her friends how serious network neutrality is.  I was baffled.<p>3) There are actually a set of rules you can follow, giving presentations can be seen as more of a science now (even the part about making your presentations entertaining is written in there).  Take a class in school, or two.  You really need to learn how to get up in front of large crowds and talk confidently about something.  Don't let fear be your reason not to do it.",1239076905

The problem is that the definition for the CPI keeps changing, and thus, it's meaning over time is less useful.<p>What this study showed is that perceived inflation is real and doesn't jive with the numbers that the economists produce.  Who is right?  A 500 person sample will be good to predict the sentiment of the US as a whole.  Gallup says that they only need 1,000 people to get +-4% so this is reasonable.<p>Ask yourself, which is more likely?  The entirety of the US population doesn't understand how prices affect them day-to-day.  Or that some economists have devised a moderately useful but not flawless metric?<p>Price formation comes from the relative values that every human being places on the marginal unit of a good.  Prices are an emergent property of people interacting chaotically in a marketplace.  To suggest that literally EVERYONE's ability to sense the change in price over time you also need to throw out the very people that set the prices to begin with.<p>EDIT: Link to gallup

That is ok. No, that is expected because you are going through the learning phase. Your learning is not happening on a practice field but is happing in the big show. So the extra hours and effort are worth it to you and the team.<p>Then later:<p>> Microsoft will feel a lot like college in terms of the hours you put in and the environment you work in. It will be fun. It will mean late nights. It will mean ""hanging out"". All of those same things. That was my experience and when I look around I see the same thing happening now.<p>Even though your excerpt makes what I would call a more correct point, I still think the above is uncool.  Reading it several years ago put me off severely and coming back to it I still think he was wrong to put it that way, even if he partially redeems himself later.

As soon as they state that you can't make money in markets - they've just crossed into stupid territory. If that were true - the world would be efficient and no one would ever make any money, because everything would be priced correctly.<p>What is with people separating stocks from businesses. If you work at a business, you are by definition stating that the market you work in is not efficient and hence EMH is bullshit. It's like massive cognitive dissonance - stocks are completely separate in people's minds from the shit that actually gets done - it's insane. It's just like religion. I mean you can happily see someone flying in a plane and the next second they'll be telling you how god exists and how science is bad. YOUR IN A FUCKING PLANE!

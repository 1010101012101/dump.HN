What&#x27;s the difference between an email client that entirely stores email in the cloud, entirely stores it locally, and, say, caches things locally but mostly stores things in the cloud (i.e., effectively <i>randomly</i> has some emails locally and users have no effectively ability to choose which is which)?

6272194,comment,6271954,6271954,2,0,froseph,,,"I think most new &quot;netbooks&quot; have been converted into 11.6 form factor to include a proper full sized keyboard. The only real reason netbooks had 10&quot; displays was because intel required it when purchasing an atom (along with their 2gb memory limit). Atoms haven&#x27;t gotten any real architectural (IPC) changes since their release and Intel has been repositioning the brand/hardware towards tablet/phone devices. Since manufacturers have been freed from the 10&quot; constraint, such most manufacturers have been building larger screened low end laptops which is really what the market wants. As such you might want to reconsider your options. Depending on the architecture of the Celeron, it may actually be faster and more battery efficient than an Atom. The options seem to be:<p>1/ Deal with an extra inch of real estate<p>2/ Buy a 7/10&quot; tablet & add a keyboard. Some like the Asus transformer pad includes a keyboard dock. You can also try rooting/chrooting a linux distro onto the tablet all the bells and whistles.<p>3/ Buy used from e-bay",1377442501

6272179,comment,6271954,6272032,4,0,captainmuon,,,"&quot;Tablets killed netbooks&quot; is a meme that gets often repeated, but is really misleading.<p>You&#x27;re definitely right that vendors have moved on from netbooks and are putting their energy now into tablets. But that doesn&#x27;t mean tablets have replaced netbooks. Netbooks have a bunch of use cases that don&#x27;t apply to tablets and vice versa.<p>I bought my good old eeePC netbook mainly for:<p>- Typing on the go. It&#x27;s much lighter than a regular laptop (was back then), and the model I have has a very good, almost-full-size keyboard.<p>- Its unprecedented battery life (again, back then). I could even forget the cable at home, and it would last the whole day.<p>- Meetings. For some reason, we have lots of meetings in my field, and almost everybody brings their laptop (to make notes, follow the slides, etc.). I found the eeePC ideal because it needs no cable (no crawling on the floor) and is small and unconspicuous. If I&#x27;m using my notebook in a meeting, at least I don&#x27;t want to hide behind it.<p>Compare with a tablet: I can hardly type anything else than text messages on touchscreens. And while laptops are for some reason socially accepted in meetings, I couldn&#x27;t show up with a tablet. Everybody would think I was just playing. (That&#x27;s changing slowly, however).<p>Finally, the biggest difference is that a netbook is a general purpose PC. I can run all programs I need for work on it. That doesn&#x27;t work on locked-down tablets.<p>When Windows 8 came out, I was really hoping for cheap 10-inch Atom or ARM tablets with the nice keyboard covers (and an <i>unlocked</i> OS so I could actually do work on them). Such a tablet would really be a worthy netbook replacement.",1377442317

I&#x27;m sure tablets didn&#x27;t help at all, but the limits kept netbooks just below the edge of usefulness in many cases.

The weapon concern obviously doesn&#x27;t exist with cell phones, but the destruction of evidence concern certainly does.<p>Obama&#x27;s argument is that creating the additional wrinkle of disallowing searches of particular kinds of things will create additional litigation over searches incident to arrest.

Conducting an in-person search of a cellphone after the suspect has been arrested seems similar to going through a bag they&#x27;re carrying.<p>The WaPo article argues that the storage capacity of modern cellphones should make them legally different (even though the phone in this case was a dumb phone), but I&#x27;m not sure how such a legal standard would work.  I suppose one approach would be for police to be able to search things physically on the phone (like contact lists) but not things that the phone simply gives them access to (like email, social networks, bank info, etc).  The problem with a smartphone is not so much that it contains a ton of info, but that it serves as an access point to a lot of personal info that would otherwise require a warrant to obtain.<p>Maybe the legal analogy would be that police can&#x27;t search your house without a warrant after they arrest you even if you have your house keys on you at the time.  They can search your belongings but can&#x27;t use those belongings (like keys) to conduct further warrantless searches.",1377440879

At it&#x27;s most basic level, it&#x27;s a question of whether the contents of items found can be apart of the search.  After all, if the police have the right to search you, then they are allowed to open the wallet you are carrying and search it (and obviously this isn&#x27;t 1:1 the same as a mobile phone, but I&#x27;m just trying to have an honest conversation about this, so if you want to anally start picking apart individual phrases or words, go somewhere else please.  Edit: Clearly, reading comprehension isn&#x27;t the same or as valued.  I&#x27;m not suggesting a wallet and a phone are the exact same thing.  Nor am I suggesting they are comparable.  If your comment starts off by saying this, you&#x27;ve failed.  I should just have made a comment about how this is awful and &quot;OMG Snowden!&quot; rather than have a discussion).<p>I&#x27;m not up on the law with regard to weapons, but assuming there is a difference in charges regarding a gun and a loaded gun, the same argument could be made: you didn&#x27;t have the right to search the contents of a gun?  And yeah, that&#x27;s stretching the comparison. =)<p>So how fine grained do you make the warrants? This is already established within the warrant system.  As I understand it, you can&#x27;t search a small locked safe if your warrant limits you to searching the property for a car.  But in the case where a person is arrested for selling crack/cocaine, and during the arrest the person is searched, and the phone is found, how far is too far.  After all, if a bag of white power had been found, would a separate warrant be needed to search the bag?<p>Anyways, it seems like this is something that should be addressed.  While I&#x27;m in support of the 4th Amendment, it discusses unreasonable searches.  And it seems reasonable to assume that if you get arrested for dealing drugs, it would be a reasonable thing to search the mobile phone you had for records.<p>Obviously, not a lawyer here.

So from, say a Spanish POV, China, not regarded as an ally, spying is expected, but an ally industrially spying is more difficult to accept. In fact, something like this may well destabilize the UN. How can such an institution be trusted if its major player and funder is using it as its own conduit for spying? Yeah &quot;we&quot; all &quot;knew&quot;, not now we really do know. Its fact.<p>What this proves is that the US is an ally of no one. The US has abused it&#x27;s self entitled presumed position of trust. Now when there is some international jolly, or what ever, US requests for insane amounts of comic book, sunglasses wearing, gun toting SS to be allowed free armed reign may well be met with a lot more skepticism. The usual suspects will continue to suck up (the UK for example has no where else to turn to, given its attitude to the EU), but over all I see a lot more difficulty for the US behind the scenes and diplomatically.<p>In short, there is a huge difference between an enemy spying and a so called ally.",1377439566

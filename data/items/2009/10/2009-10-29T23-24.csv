I'll admit that I haven't used Windows 7 or Vista, but I don't remember hacking the registry on Win95/98/ME/2k/XP installs.<p>Maybe you shouldn't get so bent out of shape so quickly. It's not like he was bashing Linux and promoting Windows/OSX. If someone gripes about Windows do you immediately rush in to make comparisons to similar problems in OSX or Linux?<p>With the way that Ubuntu does releases though, it's little wonder that people are scared to update. It's been a revision or two since Ubuntu pushed Xorg over to using evdev for mouse handling/etc, and my Thinkpad's TrackPoint is <i>still</i> only recognized as a regular mouse (no scrolling) when previous Ubuntu revisions had readily setup scrolling automatically for me.<p>{edit} I'll add there are multiple blog posts, and a LaunchPad report, IIRC with the fix... which the Ubuntu devs have not seen fit to include in Ubuntu, so a fresh install mean applying all of the fixes. {/edit}<p>With the update to Jaunty (9.04), I've had a few woes with my Atheros chipset:<p>1. ath5k was forced as the default out-of-the-box driver for Atheros chipsets over the previous madwifi (ath_hal) driver.<p>2. ath5k is flakey whenever I come home and connect to my wifi network... <i>even when the laptop is 2 feet away from the access point.</i> It will connect/disconnect from the network 2-5 times before deciding to stay connected.<p>3. If I change position in my room (with the access point in the middle), the same connect/disconnect 'settling' period still needs to happen.<p>4. /var/log/syslog is filled with spam from NetworkManager with messages along the lines of this (even when I see no visible disconnects in nm-applet):<p><pre><code>   'disconnect from network (mynetwork)'
   'connect to network (null)'
   'disconnect from network (null)'
   'connect to network (mynetwork)'
</code></pre>
5. There are unexplained slow downs in the network with the ath5k driver. For the longest time I thought that my ssh woes (random 'hangs' that last 2-6 seconds) over my network were the problem of the server, but since I've switched back to madwifi they've vanished.<p>6. The madwifi driver <i>still</i> doesn't play nice with suspend-to-ram (and maybe suspend-to-disk but I haven't tested it). It will refuse to work after waking back up (and a modprobe -r/modprobe doesn't help). Ubuntu could easily fix this... Just need to drop `SUSPEND_MODULES=""$SUSPEND_MODULES ath_hal""` into a file in '/etc/pm/config.d'. This problem has existed for at least 2 or 3 revisions of Ubuntu (maybe more). The fix is on the web and on Launchpad.net, but I have yet to see the fix make its way into an official release.<p>If me, as someone that knows my way around Linux, can get frustrated with these issues, then how can 'Bringing Linux to the Masses' be anyway near achievement?  My laptop isn't exactly a brand new laptop with highly unsupported hardware. I'm running a ThinkPad X41.<p>[ Oh, and did I mention that the headphone jack stops working after the second time I suspend/resume after a fresh boot? I'm perfectly willing to work with the Ubuntu devs on Launchpad, but all of my suggestions/information is apparently falling on deaf ears. <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/101986"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/101986</a> ]",1256860381

911173,comment,910512,910643,0,0,unalone,,,"What I find funny is that Randall fell victim to exactly what he accused Jim Davis of a long time ago. Early XKCD was, if not necessarily brilliant, unexpected and often very clever in its jokes. I know one of its earliest influences was Achewood, which, for those of you who don't know, is the Webcomic To End All Webcomics, against which nothing but the best print comics compare. It was more effortless and came across as a comic trying to <i>say</i> something.<p>His nerd jokes were occasionally actually really good. When they weren't, they came across with the air of ""Fuck you, I'm not putting these comics online for you."" Occasionally he'd hit upon a nice riff with his heartbreak comics, too, and his whimsical outlook towards life was a lot more sincere and less forced. Then he homogenized, began repeating joke concepts, and started spitting out a lot of derivative work, with only the occasional truly clever idea. It's never gotten worse than mediocre, but it's very frequently mediocre.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is all of you should read Achewood instead. The nerd jokes are better (<a href=""http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09232002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://achewood.com/index.php?date=09232002</a>), it's funnier than any comic I've ever read (it's the comic that topped Calvin and Hobbes after seventeen years on the top of my list), and it's a <i>real</i> start-up, selling monthly premium updates rather than relying on any advertising whatsoever.",1256859874

I'm a designer not a programmer.  And though I've read lots of articles in wired and on tech blogs about the netflix algorithm, I haven't heard much discussion about viable alternatives to the five star system.  Yes, there are articles talking about how the rating system is faulty, and they talk about how to best ""work around"" the faults of the five star system.  But I'm trying to brainstorm alternatives - scrap the system entirely and build an algorithm on something else.  I'm sure the ideas are out there, I'm just indignant that as a general audience, we haven't heard about them yet.  I'm getting great feedback already.  Thanks greatly appreciated.<p>For such a little UI pattern, the five star system plays an enormous influence on how we see the internet, and the effects of it have a tangible impact offline as well - for example, restaurant traffic influenced by yelp reviews.  I've heard a lot of people question how five star reviews influence the range of products that we're exposed to.  It seems like an important question to ask.  Look and now we've got a good brainstorm going.. Maybe think of my post as a challenge and request for a detailed article from someone who knows their stuff about rating systems and how they effect our everyday life.  Cheers -",1256859672

For sure, if you mean something like ""synonymous"", then probably ""identical"" things are the same in all possible worlds. But if you take it broadly enough that, e.g., ""consciousness is identical with something that happens in the brain"" isn't false <i>by definition</i> then I don't see how your argument works.<p>I only think 1 is bullshit if you use something like the ""synonymous"" definition. (Can we agree that it's crazy to say that physicalism requires believing that ""consciousness"" just <i>means</i> some particular set of brain processes?)<p>I think your comment about 3 basically amounts to agreeing with me that physicalism doesn't say that mental states and brain states are ""identical"" in any sense that makes the rest of the zombie argument work.<p>I agree, of course, that if 1-3 are correct then ""zombies are possible"" implies ""physicalism are wrong"".<p>Epiphenomenalism doesn't imply that causality is false. And if consciousness is ""outside of logic"" then I say: so much the worse for the notion of consciousness. (But I don't see any reason why we should think consciousness is outside of logic, whether zombies are possible or not.)",1256857438

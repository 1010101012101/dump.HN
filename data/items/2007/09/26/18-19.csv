59932,comment,59837,59909,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<<the English language>><p>I also hate to be a stickler, but I would distinguish between ""the English language"" as such, and orthography. The (grammar of the) former is learned all-but-completely by the age of 8 or 9. The latter is arbitrary and mostly meaningless. Shakespeare spelled his name numerous different ways. Is he uneducated in the language?<p>...<p>So: Would any companies be willing to take on 13 year olds for 4 year periods (""apprenticeships""), receiving a modest tuition in the process? That is: For 40,000 dollars over 4 years, would a company like Microsoft be willing to train up teenagers into professionals?<p>There is <i>no doubt</i> that such a system would educate more fully, and more broadly, than high school.",1190832665

It's pretty long (at over 400 pages), but if others think it's worth reading then maybe I'll go through it at some point in the future. The article in Psychology Today made it look like there wasn't that much new from the Gatto though.",1190832001

I've bookmarked this reply, so that the next 20 times I see ardit33's argument made I can just link to it rather than pounding out my own long-winded reply or just beating my head against my desk until it doesn't hurt any more.<p>(The reply that I would have written if you didn't respond first would probably have emphasized the amount of code required rather than performance.)",1190831810

59921,comment,59794,59886,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Hard-coding access paths is what is premature optimisation. RDBMS defer decisions about what loops to process until runtime. So the optimiser can make good decisions based on statistics it has about the data. Decisions that programmers do not have to make prematurely.<p>I think it's pretty clear that if you know exactly how your data is going to be used, then performance is better if you hard code everything and store it in a way that is optimised for retrieval. However, if data is used for multiple purposes, then hard-coding access paths is horrible in terms of performance and maintainance.",1190831675

59919,comment,59894,59905,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I agree. I think getting to know an angel is pretty key, so as to have a reference. One thing nice about Austin is angles (at least from my impression) are very down to earth and friendly, and are very willing to chat about startups if you want to talk to them. Outside of that, it could be difficult getting angel's attention though (which I think is a huge benefit to being funded by YC, who help facilitate initial introductions through demo day). SV could be a totally different ball of wax.<p>One thing that was made clear by those who spoke is that you need to be careful not to spoil your image. News travels easily between angels. If your company looks promising but the angels do not invest for a specific reason (such as risk), then they are likely to look at you again in the future if you improve. But if you leave a very negative impression or piss someone off in some way, then you could have much more difficulty the 2nd time. ",1190831552

59916,comment,59837,59874,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"You can specialize in engineering long before college. I was writing programs for our home computer at age 12. I'd bet that more than half the people reading this started out the same way.<p>In the specific case of computer hacking, this works - because even professional-level computer work doesn't require any equipment that a twelve-year-old cannot get. People in other fields aren't so lucky: You really can't learn much about the reality of practicing law, or medicine, or manufacturing from books or websites. You kind of have to learn these things on the job.<p>Why are so many tech companies founded by people in their twenties? Because software is one of the few fields where a twenty-two year old can have more than ten years of experience.<p>Of course, even young hackers face problems. They're still treated like children. Back when I was young, teens were rarely exposed to real mentors, taught real computer science, given real tasks, or paid real money. The web has helped to change a lot of this - on the internet nobody knows you're a teenager - which explains why young people are the web's most enthusiastic users. <p><p>",1190831384

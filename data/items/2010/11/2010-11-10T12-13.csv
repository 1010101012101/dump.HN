Just sell them a couple years later. If you find you need them again several years after that, Abe Books/Amazon will find them for you again.<p>The other is: Theoretical physics is hard, <i>evil</i> hard for most people. Don't handicap yourself with crappy tools. The difference between a lousy book [1] and a great book may be hundreds of hours, it may be frustration with the material that makes you want to cry, or it may be the difference between learning the material and hitting an impenetrable wall.<p>I should also warn you that I and my colleagues in physics routinely found that we had to sample a dozen highly-rated books in a given subfield before we found the one that gave us the insight into our particular problems. I picked up that many books on semiconductor optics - and my better-read colleagues tried many, many more papers than that - before finding Coldren and Corzine, which is a <i>revelatory</i> text. (And, for all I know, out of print now. The hell of becoming a world expert in something is that you wind up being part of a global audience that would fit in one or two buses.)<p>---<p>[1] For you, at a particular time in your career, for a particular set of things you are trying to learn. Every book is is lousy to <i>someone</i>. The fact that there is no one-size-fits-all standard for books is just another reason why your physics education is going to require a bit of trial and error, fueled by a bit of cash.",1289393124

</code></pre>
In practice it is even greater idea. Sure you can go ahead and have all your layout in tables, then go ahead and create several different versions of your site just to take care of phones, tablets and like. Or you can employ css media queries.
Sure, learning CSS (and, alas, browser quirks) takes time, but it pays off. And frankly it it much easier today than it was back when IE5 was still relevant.<p>The other funny thing is that some native applications are using HTML and CSS for UI :)",1289391212

1890012,comment,1887442,1888404,0,0,eru,,,"I agree that the paragraphs about tables driven programs and function pointers are the best part.  You can read ""Combining dataÂ­driven programs with function pointers leads to an astonishingly expressive way of working, a way that, in my experience, has often led to pleasant surprises."" as much as an endorsement of functional languages than the endorsement of OO-like techniques it was meant to.<p>Though C is not really adequate to do Lisp-like programming.  Because you can't capture free variables with C function pointers.  Of course you can get around this restriction with lambda lifting [1], but why would you want to do the job of the compiler?<p>As an example, it is quite hard to encode function composition in C, i.e. write a function that takes two function and returns their composition.  Or the same specification in (non-idiomatic [2]) Haskell:<p><pre><code>  composition :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
  composition f g =
      let h a = f (g a)
      in h
</code></pre>
I don't know of any way to make up new functions / function pointers in C at runtime.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_lifting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_lifting</a>
[2] Idiomatic would be<p><pre><code>  composition :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
  composition f g a = f (g a)
</code></pre>
but that's harder to understand for a C programmer who's not familiar with currying.  Of course Haskell also has composition as a build-in.<p>Or in Scheme (sorry, I am getting carried away with this):<p><pre><code>  (define ((composition f g) a)
    (f (g a)))</code></pre>",1289390887

I just don&#x27;t know how it will make it based on their pricing structure and how much money they can lose on transactions.<p>For example, a month ago I bought an office chair.  The retail price of this chair was $160.  Jet.com was offering the same chair for $112.  I was shocked.  Plus they have a 15% off coupon for your first order.  Needless to say, I bought the chair.<p>Jet ordered the chair from another website at the full retail price of $160 but turned around and was selling it for $112 with free shipping and a 15% off coupon code.<p>My purchase price was just $95.  Meaning Jet lost at least $65 on this transaction.<p>I just don&#x27;t know how they will stay afloat without constantly asking for money from investors.  And how long will that go on for?",1451321988

In the timeframe of the book (sometime in the 2020s, apparently), physical books’ intrinsic value has declined to the point where the books themselves are considered much less valuable than their contents.<p>So, to get at the contents, a company is destroying the books themselves—feeding them through a shredder then blowing the shreds through a tunnel lined with high-resolution cameras. The cameras capture images of the shreds, then batteries of computers stitch them together into reconstructions of the pages, like jigsaw puzzles. The idea is to gather and collate all the world’s knowledge, to unlock synergies that had been prevented by it all being so inaccessible before.&quot; -- Review by teleread <a href=""http://www.teleread.com/chris-meadows/review-rainbows-end/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teleread.com/chris-meadows/review-rainbows-end/</a>",1451321933

I&#x27;m sure if we unpacked the BLS data you cite we&#x27;d also see a correlation between higher earners coming from intact families and the possession of other forms of social capital in addition to a degree. The question is which is the dominant driver?<p>As for the citations you requested, I&#x27;d point to the raft of sob stories that have been published over the last few years which feature unfortunate stories of people six figures in debt, but working jobs that require no training. It could be these are cherry-picked examples to help advance a faulty narrative (e.g. <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/submarine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/submarine.html</a>), but to the extent they reflect a real problem we should examine the broken logic that created it.<p>So why would I suggest anyone go to a state school? As I mentioned in the last paragraph of my previous post, since WWII we&#x27;ve become more credential-focused and made a BA the bare minimum for many professional career paths——something that should be remedied in my opinion, but the reality.<p>You suggest the commodification of education is the problem—I&#x27;d argue the problem is that we don&#x27;t treat college enough like a product. Because we treat it like a rite of passage for young adults, and subsidize it heavily, you have horrible colleges offering degrees at the same price as elite schools. Instead of analytically valuing the degree based on the quality of the education offered, we treat degrees as fungible goods and splurge emotionally to obtain them.<p>In many parts of America you need a car to participate in the workforce. We don&#x27;t offer subsidies so everyone can go out and buy a Bently.<p>If you can afford college, go, it&#x27;s a great, mind-expanding experience for a young mind. It is a good rite of passage into adulthood in the US, but so is joining the military or going on a religious mission. So is night school after you&#x27;ve found a career path you like, but need further education to advance in.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the reflexive desire to turn the protection of 3rd rate colleges into a cause célèbre.",1451321797

To state it again: this is the population we actually have. They are not technically skilled, but they are educated and heavily indebted. They were told &quot;go to college, get any degree, and you will have success.&quot; This was not accurate, and now, we have an entire generation that is suffering.<p>Student loan debt is smashing the potential of the millenials and is now increasingly seen as a massive burden on their parents and (mostly uncreated, due to insufficient funds) children as well. Large-scale debt relief is mandatory at this point, as all of the money siphoned to debt maintenance is severely limiting the amount of demand that the economy&#x27;s primary consumers are able to create. Millenials aren&#x27;t buying homes, aren&#x27;t having kids, aren&#x27;t buying cars, aren&#x27;t able to put their parents into nursing homes, etc.<p>The parents of the millenials typically have some wealth that can be extracted, and so, it&#x27;s on the chopping block. This is why loans have cosigners-- so that their bank accounts can be emptied, too.<p>Debt slavery is the reality we live in, and predictably, debtors parents aren&#x27;t thrilled that their retirement is being siphoned away by their children&#x27;s debt.<p>As I said, this debt is a massive drag on the economy, and debt relief is mandatory. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not so much going on politically right now, so I think that a mass student debt boycott is a better decision. It&#x27;s unlikely that the lenders will be bankrupted, but it&#x27;ll send a message at least. Sure, they&#x27;ll ruin everyone&#x27;s credit and dock people&#x27;s wages, but that can only be sustained until there&#x27;s white riots due to poverty.

IP enforcement (which a lot of westerners seem to think it is about) is nearly absent in this countries. Farmers kill themselves because of debt from the bank (which is and will be enforcable).<p>Look at India, farmer suicides are a huge problem in certain states, and the moment you cross over the state boundary the problem goes away. These states have few things in common:<p>* A land ceiling limit, most states in India have a limit of maximum agricultural land to be limited to 14-20 something acres. This means that when you&#x27;re farm is failing, you have very limited buyers for it. Only a buyer who doesn&#x27;t already own enough land which touches the limit can buy the land.<p>* Monsanto seed is used by a LOT more farmers than those who commit suicide. This is called survivorship bias. You only see the seeds used by farmers who committed suicide, you don&#x27;t see the farmers who succeeded because of it. Thankfully some research has shown otherwise. <a href=""http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/14501"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/14...</a><p>* Farmers suicide rate in India per 100k: 1.55\n Non farmer suicide rate in India per 100k: 10.3<p>* 5 of the 29 states account for 79% of farmer suicides: Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala. The common theme is these states have higher industrialization than the rest of the states(except for MP, that state is backward as fuck). Keep in mind, a factory owner can buy a LOT more land than agricultural land limit would allow.<p>* Most of the stories westerners are being fed about Farmer suicide are from mid-2000s, when suicide peaked. When you look at the long term trend, it seems that more farmers used Monsanto&#x27;s seed, farmer suicide comes down to historic lows. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bt_Cotton_Hectares_and_Farmer_Suicides_Time_Trend_India.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bt_Cotton_Hectares_and_Fa...</a><p>> And this is why in large parts of the world mothers have come to believe that formula is better than breast milk.<p>Regarding this, I admit I don&#x27;t know much, but I learned this lesson long time ago. Be very ware of stories generated by people with an agenda. These facts and figures are generated by the left wing of India. It&#x27;s not difficult to show that Sweden&#x27;s rape epidemic is caused by it&#x27;s recent influx of immigrants, it might be the case, but I can promise you, this statistic will be thrown out almost immidiately.",1451321150

Mostly people say what you get is not worth what you pay. My own anecdote - I am by all accounts a successful &quot;business degree&quot; person. While I went to my four year college with a business major, I also started my career in business/marketing, starting at $10 an hour in freshman year, and getting to the 99th percentile of income for my age by age 24.

(I know this repo has our public keys, but if you clone it you can totally run this as well to see what&#x27;s going on).<p><pre><code>    ./bin/root-ca.sh\n    ./bin/tls-ca.sh\n    ./bin/client.sh\n</code></pre>\nThe first command will create the Root Certificate Authority in your tiered system. The second one will create a TLS Certificate Authority underneath the Root. This TLS CA is for issuing certificates (like browser client certificates, or email S/MIME certificates). Finally, the last script will walk you through creating one of these client certs.<p>The client.sh script will generate a .p12 file that you can import into Keychain or your browser&#x27;s certificate store. The only other step is to import the Root certificate (mine is TeachBoostRootCA.crt in the ca folder) into Keychain and/or your browser.<p>If you&#x27;re curious, take a look at the config file in the top level directory. This has all of the naming conventions my repo uses but if you clone this, clear the &#x27;ca&#x27;, &#x27;certs&#x27;, and &#x27;crl&#x27; folders, then you can have free reign on running your own Certificate Authority. The scripts will walk you through everything but if you have any questions don&#x27;t hesitate to open a GH issue on that repo and I&#x27;ll get back to you there.",1451320117

Even then, some people might want to sign up for CS or Business but they lose the class signup lottery because those departments are under funded and don&#x27;t have enough sections. Then they lose again for the next 3 semesters and are forced to declare a major in classes that they already have experience in.<p>There is no point where they explain the value of a degree to you and it can be difficult to understand for most people until they are 2 or 3 years in and suddenly realize that they are stuck in this path and can&#x27;t go back to change majors because it would take more school and they can&#x27;t take on more debt. You can&#x27;t drop out and start over later because then you have to start paying those loans and don&#x27;t have a degree at all.<p>tl;dr; it isn&#x27;t just these kids making bad decisions, it is a dysfunctional system that leads people down paths that are convenient for the school, not necessarily for the students.",1451319430

9206187,comment,9204352,9205399,0,0,timtylin,,,"I&#x27;ve actually been wondering if this is possible from a theoretical standpoint. I&#x27;m thinking you can use Pandoc&#x27;s LaTeX to MD conversion mode, save changes to a copy, wdiff to get the total change set, then somehow convert that into a LaTeX patch. Whether you can guarantee that this won&#x27;t break anything is going to be a really challenging problem, as my head is already swimming with edge-cases. I guess we&#x27;ll know the day that some genius comes up with automatically generated non format-breaking Critic Markup diffs. At least the problem should be easier than LaTeX --- look how long it took for the latexdiff tool to be what it is today, and it <i>still</i> breaks often when you have anything slightly exotic.<p>I&#x27;m currently using a workflow in my thesis where I use ScholarlyMarkdown to write individual chapters for final inclusion into an existing LaTeX book document. I find that ScholarlyMarkdown works quite well this way, and it potentially allows collaborators, since individual parts are isolated.",1426420670

9206182,comment,9205892,9205892,0,0,shk,,,"While I am not trying to defend the RBI, I will try and give the reasoning from RBI&#x27;s perspective. Note that I don&#x27;t personally support these bans.<p>1) Banks in India do not provide easy ways to do chargebacks. Also, many people are not even aware that you can do chargebacks. I have to manually call a bank and ask them to do so after going through a couple customer service representatives.
Also, consider that a big chunk of the population is coming in the ambit of financial institutions for the first time. Many people are opening their bank accounts for the first time. Many people in India still do not trust the banks. If they see a couple hundred bucks vanishing from their accounts, they might as well abandon putting money into the accounts.
Incidents like Target or Home Depot if happen in India will rock the trust that people have in these institutions.<p>Banking in India is a business activity synonymous with trust [1]. And in my opinion RBI has done a fine job of it.<p>2) RBI banned Paypal earlier because it concluded it&#x27;s not complying with regulatory framework of the country. These regulations are in place for a reason. If they are obsolete then we should campaign for them to be eased. But you don&#x27;t get a free pass just because you are a big entity.<p>Paypal as they were operating earlier had to be regulated as a bank and PayPal does not want that to happen. Any entity which provides on-demand payments back then had to be regulated as a bank as per RBI rules. PayPal was basically circumnavigating this regulation so that they don’t have to answer questions to the government about how they conduct business. Also, getting a banking license requires a lot of regulatory oversight. The closed wallets regulations that RBI came out with later was a in my opinion direct response to this.<p>3) Uber was routing Indian card transactions internationally. They were in essence exploiting a loophole in the regulations. If RBI hadn&#x27;t blocked Uber, then Olacabs, Flipkart, etc. will also have done the same. This will have directly undermined the 2FA policies RBI has put in place. Forcing Uber to comply with the policies was the right choice at that moment.<p>4) The proliferation of closed wallets has forced RBI to consider whether removing 2FA on small value transactions will be beneficial.<p>You should understand that India&#x27;s economy has only been opened recently. A lot of the restrictions will go away with time. If you think they are harmful then convince the RBI of the same. But these restrictions cannot be removed overnight just because a new startup feels the need for the same. RBI&#x27;s each decision will have far reaching impacts on the financial systems of the country and they need to be taken with utmost care and foresight.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=587"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=587</a><p>Edit: Added more context for Paypal",1426420503

It is that people don&#x27;t understand why they do something - this makes their work meaningless for them. And accidentally there is a big chance that their job is useless in an objective way - it is just that the people that direct them also don&#x27;t understand the system fully.<p>And the complexity grows in many ways. One is that our lives are much more regulated than they used to be - we have more laws about everything. In one way it makes lives more fair - but the complexity from the entangling of different laws grows quickly. Another is that we actually have less cultural regulations. For example - take noise from parties, in the past it was that there were just some dates when everyone was partying - because everyone had the same religion etc.<p>By they way - in &#x27;User Innovation&#x27; there is this notion of &#x27;advanced analog field&#x27; <a href=""https://books.google.pl/books?id=BvCvxqxYAuAC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=user+innovation+advanced+analog+field&source=bl&ots=juSvWvV22M&sig=YcnPe5wCA1gv5-yIiPm-9OM6pEQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YW4FVeuTJZf5auzmgYAO&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=user%20innovation%20advanced%20analog%20field&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.pl/books?id=BvCvxqxYAuAC&pg=PA134&lpg=P...</a>  - an area where there is a much stronger need for something then anywhere else.

I retract that comment and regret the error. Hopefully they add it to Github pages some time soon.<p>To be honest, there was never really any conscious decision to pick Markdown over AsciiDoc. It was just serendipity that when I was looking to convert a bunch of my existing Markdown notes to papers, John happened to add (at Martin Fenner&#x27;s urging) pretty robust support for citations to Pandoc. Being able to use an existing .bst files and Natbib author/year syntax with existing Bibtex database files, while also using CSL to format to everything else was pretty key. The syntax only worked in Markdown at the time, so I went with that. This project just simply grew into an experiment on how to get the least hack-y looking source document for what I needed.<p>Basically, I had a bunch of existing Markdown stuff typed with both my phone and my computer using NValt (already using the double-backtick math syntax as a hack), and I was looking for a way to reuse all that. If I had to do conversions or had to start from scratch, I would have just started another LaTeX Document, and then this project wouldn&#x27;t be here.<p>As an aside aside: I personally think that one shortcoming of AsciiDoc is that Markdown ended up having a more mature application ecosystem outside of the most general purpose text-editing tools. I&#x27;m thinking of something like Scrivener/Ulysses which is really great for project writing and has robust markdown support <i>while</i> writing. I&#x27;ve also recently found out that TeXpad &quot;mysteriously&quot; formats Markdown syntax in the editor, and builds an in-editor TOC of it. This is in addition to with rendering support in basically every note-taking tool. Sadly AsciiDoc doesn&#x27;t seem to have experienced a similar growth spurt in terms of popularity amongst developers, and as a result have a bit more friction to use.",1426419202

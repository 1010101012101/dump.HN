That's just not reasonable for a paying job.<p>I have a lot of passion for programming and I hack it quite well in a professional environment, thank you very much.

I am very knowledgable about the startup industry and like to think I can determine winners vs. losers with regards to early stage startups. I also know the areas of interest to me very well (local/geo, cloud, and online advertising).<p>My question is this: how do I get into investing in startups? I will be upfront and say I don't have nearly as many connections as typical angel investors, but I do have money to invest.<p>What is the best way to begin finding companies to invest in and actually investing in them? I would like to invest between $10k and $20k in a couple startups. What is the process to go about doing that? Are startups looking for someone like me who may not have as many connections? Are there startups that are looking for this amount of investment? Am I crazy to even consider this?<p>Thanks in advance!",1315950994

Crime data is a fairly natural proxy because it's readily available in an easy-to-use format.<p>It doesn't seem all that useful  it's fluffy  but it's amusing nonetheless and I don't regret reading it.<p>I'm curious what leaps of faith do you see in his reasoning? Crimes ""caught"" versus actual criminal activity seems like the obvious one, but I don't think there's really anything in the piece that makes that distinction necessary. (Police activity might actually be a better proxy for activity than criminal activity.)",1315947823

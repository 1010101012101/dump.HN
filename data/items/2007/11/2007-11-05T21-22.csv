76392,comment,76258,76271,0,0,shayan,,,"""The rest of OReilly's article seems to base itself on where the ""real me"" resides. On facebook vs something else.""<p>I am not sure if it says where else it resides, I think every part of the real me (in this article Mr. OReilly's real me) resides in different parts, and in order to get <i>complete real me</i> you then have to combine all these graphs (networks)<p>if phography is my hobby, then I will probably be very active on Flickr and my social graph there is just one angel of what the real me is ... it is the real me in the world of photography, or its the real me when I am playing the role of a photographer, which couldnt necessarily be copied easily with more general sites, like Facebook or Myspace ",1194298656
76391,comment,76258,76258,0,0,joshwa,,,"Tim is really getting it right here-- and the analogy drawn here between the withdrawal of the Google SOAP API's in favor of the AJAX widgets is spot on. <p>Google/OpenSocial and Facebook/F8 severely limit the scope of the kinds of social applications that can be built. A widget living inside a controlled ecosystem is not an app! <p>That universal social aggregator we've all been dreaming about (and that friendfeed, readr, plaxo pulse, etc. have been trying for) is never going to happen when the data usage is so restricted.<p>Let me authorize my app (via oauth or similar) and get real data feeds (RSS/Atom/JSON) for me to mash up and leverage as I see fit! Why can't  I get an RSS feed of my Facebook friends' news feed (and not just status updates)? And give me the firehose, let a thousand filtering algorithms bloom! Once someone creates a compelling social network host that lets me freely extract and aggregate all my friends' activity streams on demand, that'll be the real social web platform we've all been waiting for, and not just a widget host.<p>I think this is a real crossroads for Google and Facebook-- they've both been nominated as the next ""Evil Empire"", and how rigidly they control their developer and user ecosystems will determine if we'll learn to love or fear these companies in the next few years. Both have recently taken steps in the wrong direction.<p>NB: Someone should make a try at establishing a ""social news feed"" standard. An atom extension with an indication of event source, type, priority, etc...",1194298647

We can also have mutual-rating numbers where these 'scores' become dynamic. <p>There can be online 'dates' or interviews where potential cofounders assess each other using the same questions as guidelines. these meetings take place via Instant Messenger chat - or if in the same city, a face-to-face meeting.<p>The more 'dates' or interviews you have, the more other people can assess you and presumably, the more accurate your score. The mutual rating scores would have to be combined in some way.<p>",1173620028

I've never done an international site; are there other things I should keep in mind?  ",1173619427

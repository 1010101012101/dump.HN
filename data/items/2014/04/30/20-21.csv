This shouldn&#x27;t be important but there are few groups that get more irrational hate than vegans. He cites multiple studies and if you are really concerned it&#x27;s a quick read. One study showed how effectiveness of a specific antibiotic was at ~99% and then only 10 years after it being introduced into livestock feed the effectiveness shot down to 80%. So we went from about a 1 in 100 chance of it not working to around 1 in 5. That is a <i>massive</i> and terrifying difference. I urge you to read more. Clearly this is an issue I care about. I firmly believe this is the most likely cause of my unnecessary death. Far more than war or terrorism. Protect yourself, your loved ones, your children, your grand children. Stop eating meat that is fed antibiotics.",1398891576

7676394,comment,7675418,7675752,1,0,MarkPNeyer,,,"The value of a currency is a measurement of the faith of people holding it. That&#x27;s all it is.<p>If people have no faith in a currency, they&#x27;ll drop it like bad habit. If people have a ton of faith in a currency, they&#x27;ll hoard it like crazy.<p>Everything you buy with a currency is, again, a decision you make based upon faith. You have _faith_ that a house will be a good place to live, that it&#x27;ll provide for your needs and maybe be worth more in the future. Of course there are _reasons_ for this - and i can understand you objecting to me claiming that it&#x27;s just faith.  Reasons are great, for sure,  because  we&#x27;ve found that faith which is contradicted by all reason tends to fail.  The reasons we have, though, are entirely historical. I have faith that the sun won&#x27;t explode tomorrow. My _reasoning_ for this is based upon my understanding of the physics of stars and which ones explode and which ones don&#x27;t, but i recognize that i may be wrong. That&#x27;s faith.  If someone has _no faith_ that the dollar wil be worth anything, he&#x27;s not going to hold any. If he thinks &#x27;well i dont think it&#x27;ll be worth anything, but i&#x27;m sure other people will think it does&#x27;  then he has faith that it will have value in the future - because other people having faith in it confers value to it.<p>Bitcoin is powered by the blockchain. If bitcoin is worth a lot of money, then the blockchain will be much harder to break or adulterate. It&#x27;s not just a means of storing account balances - people can store whatever they want in the public records. No government can tamper with it, and no company can claim copyright and censor it.<p>I think that&#x27;s something a lot of people would like to have faith in.",1398891543

Since 1945 many have fixated on the revolutionary\nmilitary technologies that the Third Reich developed in the last two years of the war. The cultural impetus behind the concept, as implicitly or explicitly acknowledged by historians in the uneven and largely enthusiastic literature on the subject, was an irrational faith in technology to prevail in operationally or strategically complex and desperate situations. a conviction amounting to a disease, to which many in the Third Reich were prone in the latter years of the Second World War. To the extent that it shaped decision making, faith in the Wunderwaffen\nwas a special, superficial kind of technological determinism, a confidence in the power of technology to prevail over the country’s strategic, operational, and doctrinal shortcomings&quot;</i><p>From this: <a href=""http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/dd165021-2812-40ba-847f-d5b4c3e4ac4e/Innovation-for-Its-Own-Sake--The-Type-XXI-U-boat.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/dd165021-2812-40ba-847f-d...</a><p>When I read it, it reasonated with a lot of the narrative I hear in policy circles about China as a military power. The reasoning goes like this; The US as an insurmountable technological edge over China, todays wars are technology heavy, therefore the US has an insurmountable military edge over China.<p>Personally, I expect that reasoning to prevail until the Chinese are sending people to the Moon and getting them back alive. Such a situation will deny that China is just &quot;re-using old soviet gear&quot; and &quot;they can&#x27;t mount a complex technological development program&quot; in one stroke (both arguments I hear from the &#x27;paper tiger&#x27; camp).

This leaves us with $7/2=$3.50 food cost. So we get about $1 to split for extra stuff for lunch. We can easily make egg/toast for breakfast, for $.50 cents (egg and a tbsp of jam), and get 5g protein. So now, we need to eat our lunch: 1/3 loaf of bread, 3/4 jar of sardines, and some mustard. Mix in the olive oil and its a reasonable amount of food. But there is only 15g of protein /per 100g in preserved anchovies. So, lunch plus breakfast is ~20g and 1/2 salad is 8g, total of 28... In other words, you are missing your protein intake by 50%. So, the price for eating kale salad while sticking to $4/day--even with generous assumptions--is that the rest of your meals need to make up for it. This is only realistic with a certain level of culinary sophistication. The type of basic re-purposing of ingredients illustrated above is much more likely in reality. And the tradeoffs there are you have to stomach a sandwich that some may condsider an aquited taste (although with 1/2 a lemon and some parsely not so bad) for lunch.

On the other hand increasing reservation demand can occur even without any new transactional demand.

A success case for bitcoin is that it becomes Gold 2.0. Gold&#x27;s market cap is approximately 7 trillion. Bitcoin&#x27;s market cap is approximately 6 billion. If Bitcoin were to replace gold as an alternatively medium of savings (say, in 50 years), its price could be hundreds or thousands of times higher than it is now without needed much, if any, increase in transactional use.

7676260,comment,7673529,7675262,1,0,modernerd,,,"I agree with you – WordPress is often criticised within the tech community. That&#x27;s because its philosophy has always been to optimise for end-user happiness first and developer happiness second. If you think something in WordPress is crazy – such as supporting PHP 5.2 – the reason is normally that it may be worse for developers, but it is much better for end-users. As soon as I understood and accepted that, I had much more fun with WordPress.<p>But I think the criticism in the tech community is also a cry for a strong alternative. And we have so few good ones today. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m happy to champion and celebrate anyone taking on an entrenched platform. If nothing else, Ghost and competing platforms will encourage WordPress to become something even better.<p>Some responses to your comments:<p><i>Right, so what happens when your needs grow and you need functionality that extends outside of the envelope of Ghost?</i><p>You&#x27;ll install Ghost apps, just as you install WordPress plugins like Advanced Custom Fields if you want to bend WordPress into a more feature-complete CMS. It&#x27;s too early to say whether Ghost will succeed at creating a better add-on system, so perhaps this particular debate is premature. The challenge will be in creating an API that allows developers to bolt-on features without also enabling UI cruft and the sort of performance headaches and conflicts you see with WP plugins, which don&#x27;t enforce sane practises like namespacing (thanks, PHP 5.2!).<p><i>Ghost may be &quot;easier to use&quot; but one thing that is difficult with it over WordPress is it&#x27;s a lot harder to install - requires Node.JS which doesn&#x27;t run on most shared accounts (where most people host blogs). The average non-technical person shouldn&#x27;t be trying to manage a VPS or server.</i><p>I agree with you – at the moment the install process is too hard for non-technical users and a burden for technical ones. But the official Ghost hosting platform is inexpensive, easy to get started with, and happy to accept custom themes, so there is little reason for most users to look elsewhere. Those who want to host a blog themselves already have several alternatives that don&#x27;t require sysadmin skills – WebFaction has a Ghost installer, for example, and they charge shared-hosting prices ($9.95/month). I suspect we&#x27;ll see other suppliers who offer Ghost-only hosting to bloggers with lots of traffic, just as WP Engine and others have done with WordPress.<p><i>Most plugins don&#x27;t abuse the addition of menu items - most of the ones that create a new root-level menu item do so because they have sophisticated/deep enough configuration that requires it. I&#x27;m not sure that added menu items makes WordPress particularly &quot;difficult to use&quot; especially if the alternative is that functionality isn&#x27;t available in the first place.</i><p>The problem is that these menu items can be created in at least three different areas – under Settings, under Tools, and at the top level. This makes things harder for users because they have to remember where the menu item of the configuration page for that plugin they installed four months ago is. I use WordPress every day and the menu system is a giant game of hunt-and-peck.<p>The menu setup also makes things harder for developers because they have to make the right choice of where their menu item will live. A great many get it wrong. (They will frequently place items at the top level that should have been under Settings or Tools.)<p>Additionally, the menus API invites games of Competitive Menu Trumping, where developers fight to get their menu item above those of other developers. Automattic are guilty of this – install their Jetpack plugin and you&#x27;ll find a new &quot;Jetpack&quot; menu item right at the top of the menu bar, just below Dashboard: <a href=""http://d.pr/i/AZyt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/i/AZyt</a> This is either a desperate call for attention or an admission that the menu system is broken – that if it was placed under the Settings header instead, the Jetpack settings page might never be found.<p>Plugin author &quot;WingerSpeed&quot; has even created a plugin named &quot;Slim Jetpack&quot; that functions almost exactly like Jetpack, but removes the menu item and banners from the top of the page. It&#x27;s been downloaded almost 50,000 times – nowhere near the 10 million or so downloads that Jetpack itself has, but still a sign that menu bar bloat, dashboard adverts, and enforced sign-ins are complications and annoyances that many users would prefer not to have.<p><i>WordPress&#x27;s /wp-admin/ can be super fast - that&#x27;s down to where you are running it.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just down to hardware – WordPress is not yet a full MVC-style JavaScript app. Side-by-side, it does not feel as fast as Ghost on the front or back end. I just logged into an account I managed with one of the big WP hosts, and it&#x27;s a huge improvement over how it feels with shared hosting, but if you compare it side-by-side with a Ghost blog it feels slower. Perhaps that&#x27;s a little unscientific and anecdotal, but raw perception matters. To be fairer, Ghost&#x27;s perceived speed is largely because it got a fresh start and doesn&#x27;t carry 10 years of baggage, but also because it does less and makes fewer requests (11 vs 18 for the basic admin page). But the upshot is that it behaves more like a modern front-end JS app than WordPress currently does (even though that&#x27;s changing) – the perceived performance mirrors the underlying architectural choices.<p><i>Drafts are saved automatically and with browsable history so the need for Command-S is removed.</i><p>Auto-save is great. I agree that this is better for users. My point was that, for writers and users with muscle-memory Command+S twitches like me, the fact that the shortcut triggers a save action instead of a browser menu shows that the app&#x27;s been developed to feel more like a desktop one. It&#x27;s a nice touch. (I believe the WP post editor disables Command+S when the box has focus, so it&#x27;s not like they haven&#x27;t thought of it – it&#x27;s just a different approach.)<p><i>Materially, that&#x27;s no different to the WordPress Foundation.</i><p>Absolutely. Except that the Ghost Foundation is just the Ghost Foundation. There is no commercial arm like with Automattic – no for-profit company feeding from the work of open source contributors (and giving a lot back, to be fair). Most won&#x27;t care or appreciate the difference, but it&#x27;s an important distinction for some.<p><i>Pricing for official WordPress hosting is even more reasonable - free.</i><p>Sure, it&#x27;s free if you want to use a modified version of WordPress. It&#x27;s free if you don&#x27;t need to add plugins or themes. It&#x27;s free if you don&#x27;t need to edit CSS. It&#x27;s free if you don&#x27;t want to use your own domain. Once you add the various upgrades or one of their (very decently priced) bundles, and once you pay for separate email hosting (which WP.com doesn&#x27;t include), you&#x27;ll soon be looking at shared hosting pricing or the headache of migration to a self-hosted setup. It&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s a free entry point, but perhaps sometimes that can turn into more of a burden than a benefit. Ghost Pro has a free full-featured trial, for what it&#x27;s worth.<p><i>But also has a clear path to scalability via various Managed WordPress Providers if needs be.</i><p>Ghost Pro offers a clear upgrade path that scales based on traffic, just as managed providers like WP Engine do: <a href=""http://d.pr/i/SWHO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.pr/i/SWHO</a> If you start with them you can grow with them too.<p><i>The &quot;Upgrade to Pro&quot; part is a bit of a straw-man argument. I&#x27;m sure there must be some WP plugins that do that but not many, and any widget on the Dashboard can be easily moved or removed. Users can customize their dashbord with what they want, and a reasonable counter-perspective would be that a small RSS feed of WordPress news and articles isn&#x27;t a negative.</i><p>It&#x27;s not a straw-man argument – it&#x27;s a genuine problem. I started collecting screen shots of the Dashboards and various intrusive banners from Dashboards I&#x27;ve logged into over several years of web consulting and it paints an ugly picture.

From personal experience (working with petabytes of disk based storage), I would put money on the fact that AWS is not using stock off the shelf older disks and then powering them on/off as a method of storage. The <i>last</i> thing you want to do with an older disk (5+ years) is <i>ever</i> power it off. The chances of it coming back to life decrease rapidly with each cycle. Picture seized bearings, etc. Your best hope it to keep them continually moving, but never powered down for extended periods of time.<p>Also, the GB/power/physical space required ratio does not make sense after X number of years. For example, you could replace 3 shelves of 1TB disks, with one shelf of 3TB disks. Yielding less power consumption in less physical space! When you are at scale, data centre space and power are big factors. For these reasons, I do not think they are using old stock disks.<p>NOTE: Maybe they are using some custom make disks, but from what I know about standard disks, even enterprise, they do not like being powered on/off when they get old.",1398889721

NCLB).<p>To your specific points:<p>1) Budget concerns make this prohibitively expensive for the majority of school districts. School districts frequently devolve the expense of providing classroom items on to teachers, or parents. Without an increase in funding, this item is a non-starter. Unfortunately, thanks mainly to conservatives (whether they call themselves &quot;Republicans&quot; or &quot;Democrats&quot;) in our government, providing extra funding is unlikely.<p>2) There are a wide variety of online schools (actual, &quot;accredited&quot; schools run by various public school districts or private companies contracting with state Departments of Education) already. Having some experience in this area (indirectly), I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a good idea or approach for students who aren&#x27;t already highly capable and motivated.<p>3) The start time problem may be solvable. However budget issues arise here, too. Starting later means shifting times for running lights and A/C, possibly during peak usage in some areas of the country, and that has to be accounted for. So all the budgetary problems that conservatives impose would apply for this as well. Throwing in school-provided nutritional breakfasts would just exacerbate the issue.<p>4) Testing in general is an inadequate, poor, and generally poorly implemented way to measure knowledge. The very bright will either be bored to tears (and receive poor marks) or &quot;game&quot; the test with good test taking skills. Everybody else will just have increased stress with little benefit.<p>5) Again, budget issues would make this a huge problem to implement. Thank conservatives running our government for that.<p>6) No comments; I&#x27;m neutral on this.<p>7) See: budget concerns. Gym/P.E., debate, home economics, shop, art, music, etc. are all under retrenchment because conservatives in our government refuse to provide the resources to make these things happen.<p>8) See my comments from (2); this is great in theory but simply put the majority of students are either not capable of or unwilling to utilize such freedom successfully.<p>Charter schools are little better than vehicles for the enrichment of private individuals at the expense of the public treasury. They&#x27;re thinly veiled means for a transfer of tax dollars to connected and wealthy individuals, and they&#x27;re a non-starter, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. They don&#x27;t belong in a serious discussion about reform of our education system.<p>Private schools aren&#x27;t a solution for the majority (the vast, overwhelming majority) of the public, who can&#x27;t afford tuition. Even if they were, there is scant evidence that private schools provide better education than public schools when compounding factors (e.g. selecting for economic or other privileged status) are taken into account. It&#x27;s easy to have high graduation and college/Ivy League acceptance rates when one selectively refuses to admit the most disadvantaged students.",1398889655

First, let&#x27;s take for a given that within ten years bitcoin will have a role in the world money supply similar to gold (cap of $7.2 trillion on all gold ever mined) or the M2 money supply of USD.  (<a href=""http://money.howstuffworks.com/how-much-money-is-in-the-world.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.howstuffworks.com/how-much-money-is-in-the-worl...</a>)<p>This doesn&#x27;t count other currencies and is not &quot;most&quot; of the world money supply.<p>There is a limit on the number of bitcoins that can ever be mined, at 21 million. (More than half have been mined, so let&#x27;s use that upper limit - you may want to multiply by two to account for the current supply instead). If were to divide $7 trillion by 21 million we would get a bit over $330,000 per bitcoin.<p>Since we started with the assumption that bitcoin would become a world currency or money supply, and the bitcoin protocol limits supply to 21 million ever, we are forced to continue our argument with a target price of $330K/bitcoin over 10 years.<p>This does, however, pose a problem.<p>We started with the assumption that bitcoin succeeds as a <i>currency</i>.<p>That means people have to get their hands on it and use it.<p>But if we go from today&#x27;s price ($445) to our logically mandated target price ($330K) in ten years, that means the value of bitcoins increases by a factor of 741 (330 000/445) over 10 years, i.e. a compound average of 94% per year.  (1.94^10 = 741).<p>Do we have a contradiction yet?  I think we do.<p>--> Is it possible for the price of bitcoin to rise an average of 94% per year, for ten years, while:<p>--> it is also being adopted as a world currency?<p>I believe the answer is &quot;no&quot;.  Let&#x27;s look at some of the behavior that&#x27;s necessary in order for it to count as a &quot;world currency&quot;:<p>1.  Borrowing BTC for productive purposes.<p>One of the major reasons, if not <i>the</i> major reason that USD is a currency of business and gold is not, is that you can borrow USD for productive purposes.  Indeed, this can happen directly by increasing the money supply centrally in a way that gets to people for loan purposes, but also happens implicitly due to systemic inflation.  Inflation mandates that some USD will always be lent.  This is because inflation is a hidden taxes on keeping USD <i>qua</i> USD.  If you come to possess $1M in cash, you would be insane to keep it as cash for 20 years.  Inflation would just eat a large chunk of it.  Not so with currencies that do not experience inflation.<p>2.  This deflation is toxic to using bitcoins by people who have them.<p>If bitcoins are going to increase in value by 91% if you keep them for a year, then if you possess bitcoins, you would be crazy to spend them on anything that does not produce a 91% return for you within a shorter time period.  This is going to seriously hinder spending, and adoption.  Certainly, some people may be &quot;forced&quot; to sell some of their bitcoins.  But that is not the way in which a currency succeeds.  By people preferring not to spend it, but having to do so in some extraordinary cases.<p>3.  Fees on exchanges may be higher.  If btc has a high price, and is considered an investment, you may be leery of buying some from somebody (which may cost you percentages) to buy goods that are not actually denominated in BTC.  The volatility may also put you off.<p>In this sense bitcoin would behave more like Picassos than like USD or any other world currency.  People are just going to hang on to it.<p>4.  So what if people need money?  Wouldn&#x27;t they still just get some BTC at the current spot price?<p>The thing is, if most people are hoarding BTC with very little spending of it, when it can be at all avoided, there will NOT be a price set by deep markets of goods and services.  There is no &quot;floor&quot; on the price.  That is dangerous for bitcoin.  It is still possible to buy and transfer &quot;just in time&quot; to be sold back into fiat by the merchant.<p>But people are not going to print menus, catalogues, ads, or other more than transient pegs to price, just as nobody prints prices in ounces of gold.<p>You will therefore have a case in which there is no built-in usage or acceptance of bitcoins, denomination in bitcoins of goods and services, or large transactions such as investments being built against bitcoin.  Since nobody uses bitcoins as an actual currency, there is no floor to its adoption.  Essentially actual users of the currency are priced out of it.  This is contrary to our initial assumpion!<p>You may say - well, so what if it is hard to get.  People will still get it at a spot price, to pay for goods, even if nothing is denominated in BTC.<p>But then we must ask - well, why in BTC then? Why not another alt currency?  If only the spot price matters...<p>So any POSSIBLE floor on the price will drop out, since btc does not have a unique position.  Will it take on a role that Gold has over thousands of years - that people recognize its value implicitly, even after it has long since not been used as currency, and there is no obvious substitute (like silver and platinum)?<p>Well, here&#x27;s the thing.  Gold has several unique properties that most other precious metals don&#x27;t have.  It&#x27;s easy to essay, very dense, can be recognized and verified, and has a long history of acceptance all over the world.  Bitcoin does not have a long history of acceptance all over the world, the software can break, but, if the software is <i>not</i> broken, if its verifiability is in tact - THEN IT IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS REGARD!<p>Indeed, anyone can use litecoins, doegecoins, or other currency.  As bitcoin becomes too valuable to spend (unless you can get a 91% return), it would simply make sense to use the spot price of another currency to trade with instead.<p>So by the very fact that its properties are not totally unique, it does not have actual usage as a unit of account, it is failing in its bid to become the default online currency.<p>At best, it can end up like gold compared to USD, and fail to be an online currency.  At worst, it can tank.<p>So while it is certainly possible for BTC to maintain their value - as a currency it can never reach much use.  Moreover there is a large risk that the speculation will cease - i.e. that the hoarding behavior was a &quot;bubble&quot;.  Look at the volumes of litecoin and dogecoin versus BTC.  This may easily happen.<p>-<p>I believe that an online currency could be created that is more like USD than like Gold.<p>Here is how the USD has been treated since 1913:<p>&quot;The U.S. Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: Maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates&quot;.&quot;<p>Today, bitcoin fails at all three.  (It will not create employment from people spending it to whom it is lent; the price of goods denominated in BTC is extremely unstable; and it would have extremely high interest rates.)<p>I believe that there is a way to do far more in a digital currency.  But BTC is not it.<p>It simply, logically, cannot succeed as a currency or world money supply.  Its behavior as an investment is also completely uncertain - nothing makes it unique versus other alt currencies, not the technology, not acceptance, and its price fights against real adoption.<p>This sets up a dangerous tulip-like situation.  I personally would not invest in BTC holdings, nor do I think it is a good candidate for Internet money.",1398889309

Similar trends have been seen in Botswana, South Africa, and Swaziland. For these benefits to be outweighed by risks requires reproducible evidence that DDT is dangerous, but none exists. WHO’s latest assessment found no evidence for concern “about levels of exposure for any of the end-points that were assessed” in carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, or developmental toxicity.<p>Yet despite this endorsement and admirable malaria control results, UNEP is trying to eliminate DDT again. As major UNEP donors, including the European Union, have endorsed WHO’s position, UNEP’s motivations are unclear.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6801?ijkey=H4KijaZlhGvkDLK&keytype=ref"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e6801?ijkey=H4KijaZlhGvkD...</a>",1398889285

Op. at 5).<p>&quot;Something less than &#x27;bad faith,&#x27; we believe, suffices to mark a case as &#x27;exceptional.&#x27;&quot; (Slip. Op. at 6).<p>In other words, the court interpreted section 285 to allow fee-shifting in cases that are not so weak that the court would be justified in sanctioning the plaintiffs under Rule 11 for pursuing a frivolous claim, or in cases where plaintiffs use tactics that do not quite rise to the level that would be sanctionable for bad faith.<p>However, the Court did not give as much guidance to lower courts as one might have hoped. The Court stated that a case that is weak to a degree short of &quot;sanctionable&quot; may be the subject of fee shifting. It has not said how much stronger than &quot;sanctionable&quot; a case can be before awarding fees is an abuse of discretion on the part of the District Court.

The latter is all about creating and replicating efficient processes; the former is about sui generis creation, like sculpture.<p>FWIW in my mind after all these years, I&#x27;ve come to some of the very same conclusions but these do a great job of articulating WHY.  Sort of like learning to play music by rote vs learning to read music.<p>So in my &quot;not a developer&quot; mind I&#x27;ve chalked it up to the fact that every website is a cathedral.  Each one is different.  Each one is built by artisans from scratch.<p>But this post and other posts on the blog really explain exactly why each site is unique and the issues around research in a way no other engineer has ever explained to me before.  Now I fully understand what to look for and how to ask for it.  I&#x27;d had product owner/scrum training so I thoroughly understood story points, break stuff down, but the clincher for me here was the idea of prioritizing the smaller stories that help us learn quickly, almost MVPing the MVP.<p>Again, this is stuff I&#x27;ve sort of picked up over the years, but what a gift to help others skip that way of learning.

7676023,comment,7675418,7675809,12,0,battani,,,"Sam is making valid points. But bitcoin&#x27;s survival is not a function of its price in USD, and its adoption rate is also not a function of its price in USD. If we want to think of bitcoin as a currency, we have to stop thinking of it as a store-of-value/investment asset and start thinking of it as an efficient means of exchange.<p>There is no such thing as &quot;buy pressure&quot; or &quot;sell pressure&quot; in liquid markets (BTCUSD is liquid enough to qualify). Buying and selling are two sides of the same coin. There are scenarios that push people to sell (as mentioned in the article, miners selling to pay for electricity), but the volume of such trade orders is just a fraction of the volume built up by speculation, and speculation goes both ways.<p>I would argue that bitcoin&#x27;s default &quot;price pressure&quot; is up because there is no easy way to short it (for the average trader) and early adopters (who own a large amount of bitcoin) are extremely evangelistic holders and buyers.<p>The argument that bitcoin may not survive is a valid one. Not because it&#x27;s not being adopted by merchants (merchants couldn&#x27;t care less about bitcoin, they receive fiat currency), but because <i>consumers</i> are not using it to make purchases or transfer money. <i>Consumer adoption</i> is the real measure of how much the ecosystem is evolving. Merchant adoption is just pure marketing at this point, and I believe that companies such as Coinbase and BitPay that are pursuing merchant adoption aggressively are in the wrong business.<p>I feel nobody here likes to hear it and I feel like a lot of people in SV are tuning this out, but bitcoin is really, really struggling to find a relevant use case, especially with consumers. Regular consumers have absolutely no reason to use bitcoin. The &quot;1-click&quot; payment and 1% price discount are not appealing enough to the average Joe who already gets 1-2% cash back, airline miles, and consumer protection on his credit card (and 1-click checkouts on many e-commerce platforms). And more regulation isn&#x27;t helping the &quot;crypto-anarchist&quot; decentralization angle either.<p>Bitcoin is great, for <i>MERCHANTS</i>.<p>But <i>payments is a two-sided market</i>. A winning product must appeal to both sides, the buyer and the seller. Bitcoin appeals to the seller at the expense of the buyer. Even if the blockchain technology overcomes all of its flaws, we would have bootstrapped a value exchange system that does not offer greater benefit to the one that exists today.<p>Many are making the flawed and simplistic analogy of comparing bitcoin/blockchain technology to the early days of the Internet... That analogy is not valid. When it comes to money, consumers actually <i>want</i> a central authority. They want to be insured and cuddled and protected and not run the risk (however small) of being criminally liable for transactions and have someone to speak with if they make an erroneous transaction or have their card stolen. And they can already do all that, which makes it tremendously difficult to compel them to change the habits they&#x27;ve had in forever to adopt a system that does not provide them with significant advantages.<p>I&#x27;ve been in bitcoin since 2011 and used to be a big believer, but I don&#x27;t see bitcoin or blockchain technology gaining traction with consumers, because <i>it simply doesn&#x27;t solve a problem for them</i>.<p>It could be destined to eternally remain a store of value (like gold) or find targeted applications (like machine-to-machine payments).

This spurs occasional bubbles, but we haven’t yet seen it work long term.<p>Bitcoin is doomed because it has no value.<p>Commodities have value.  Modern trade began by people trading commodities for each other.  Some commodities had attributes which made them good currencies - they were portable, fungible, divisible etc.  Gold is an example of a commodity which makes a good currency, other precious metals like silver are good as well.<p>Bitcoins are worthless.

Bitcoin&#x27;s inevitable collapse will be a sign of this.  My argument is falsifiable - if Bitcoins retain value, I&#x27;m wrong (of course Keynes said markets seemed to remain irrational longer than he himself could remain solvent).  The Bitcoin&#x27;s advocates are making an argument that is not falsifiable.  &quot;It&#x27;s worth something because it&#x27;s worth something&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s worth something because people think it&#x27;s worth something&quot;.

Anyone can create these valueless currencies - even joke ones like Dogecoin reach market caps in the tens of millions.<p>The only semi-rational argument for Bitcoin is the one that goes &quot;1971 paper currencies like the dollar, yen etc. have not been backed by gold (or some other commodity) since 1971, so why can&#x27;t Bitcoins have value&quot;?

7675989,comment,7673643,7674738,5,0,curun1r,,,"> I also google applicants to find their Github profiles if they haven&#x27;t supplied them, and that seems fair to me too.<p>We&#x27;ve done somewhat the reverse...we had a script that would use the GitHub API to find projects using certain technologies, measure them according to certain metrics (test coverage, LoC, etc) and resolve them to GitHub profiles which were filtered for location and then reviewed manually. The ones that passed we resolved to LI profiles and contacted about our open positions.<p>It worked well and almost completely eliminated any discrimination along any protected class. Then again, we may have been violating the GitHub ToS, so a lawyer probably would have dinged us on that. Still, it was such an effective recruiting technique that it may be worth it. And reviewing code in GitHub is so much more enjoyable (and informative) than sifting through resumes.",1398888030

I don&#x27;t know the answer, but if they&#x27;re not, that would certainly cast doubt on the claim.",1398888026

But its a stretch to say that for Promises/A+ implementations<p>&quot;... always require at least one more iteration of the event loop to resolve. This is not necessarily true of the standard callback approach.&quot;<p>as the article states. A fully synchronous chain of 20 operations wont take 100ms - it will only take 5ms",1398888003

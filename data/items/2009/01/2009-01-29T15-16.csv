This, alongside sexual education in schools that focuses on that 1% (used correctly) failure rate of condoms and lack of hard scientific evidence it will prevent the spread of HPV, leading them to think ""condoms are unreliable, so why bother?"" has led to a thriving youth culture of unprotected oral sex...and later, when they become sexually active, unprotected sex.<p>And it just so happens one of the primary ways women catch HSV-2 is through a partner infecting them orally. There are ""virgins"" getting herpes in America.<p>Now, again, culturally, I've been told that Aussie men are incredibly chauvinistic, so maybe a smaller percentage is likely to engage in oral sex.

Domain Pigeon helps you find unregistered domain names for your websites. Please let me know what you think.<p>The long of it: 
In March of last year I was in the process of writing some poker software and trying to decide on a name for it. I wanted a good name and also wanted to own the corresponding domain name so that people could easily find it. I used Ajaxwhois, a great site that lets shows you the availability of domain names as you type, and quickly got pulled in trying to find a good domain. I would spend hours trying things like “pokerguru.com”, “pokermaster.com”, “pokercalculator.com”, “pokerexpert.com”, and so on. After a lot of time and energy later, I found “allinexpert.com”, which became the name of the software.<p>Fast forward to about July. ALL IN Expert had just flopped and I was trying to decide on a new project to work on. I had several ideas in mind and again, I wanted a good domain name for whatever it wound up being. It was kind of sick: I wound up going back to Ajaxwhois and using it as the tie breaker. If I could find a good domain name for one project and not the other, that would be what I worked on.<p>It was crazy. There's got to be a better way. I wrote a small piece of software that played with various word combinations and displayed their availability.  Surprisingly, there are a lot of decent domains out there... you just have to be patient enough or resourceful enough to find them.<p>Then it hit me: This is something other people could use too. I put the other ideas on the back burner and started on this one.<p>Domain Pigeon, an eccentric but hopefully memorable name I discovered with the same software, is intended to make finding unregistered domain names easier. It has been my learn Rails/JavaScript/web development nights and weekends project over the last few months. I hope you like it.<p>This is round two of its launch. Last week I posted a link to Philly on Rails, a local group of Rails aficionados, and received a lot of great feedback. The result is what you see today (hopefully, depending on how DreamHost does with the traffic).<p>I've got a list of about two dozens features I intend to add over the coming weeks, which will be modified and prioritized based on your feedback.<p>For me, Domain Pigeon has been as much about learning the process as it has been about the releasing the product. On that note, all feedback, positive and negative, is welcomed. I also keep a blog, mattmazur.com, where I write about Domain Pigeon and its progress for anyone that is interested. I try to be as transparent as possible, as that's the best way to get valuable feedback.<p>On a final note, a lot of the design decisions for Domain Pigeon were adapted from feedback given to other people launching their sites on HackerNews and for that, I owe you all a thank you.<p>Please let me know what you think.",1233243805

That means it can address 2^32 (4,294,967,296; 4GB) distinct bytes. But the memory is managed by the OS. So it's possible to have an OS that won't use more than 4GB even though the processor can handle more than that.<p>Also, most modern x86 processors have a hack - Physical Address Extension (PAE) - that let the 32-bit processors address up to 64 GB.",1233243800

Base it on something like gold and the currency will still have higher order effects that aren't directly connected to gold.

Interesting though, I love reading about stories like this. All presidents have interesting quirks.<p>> ""I’ll never forget going to work on a Saturday morning, getting called down to the Oval Office because there was something he was mad about,"" said Dan Bartlett, who was counselor to Mr. Bush. ""I had on khakis and a buttoned-down shirt, and I had to stand by the door and get chewed out for about 15 minutes. He wouldn’t even let me cross the threshold.""<p>> Under Mr. Bush, punctuality was a virtue. Meetings started early — the former president once locked Secretary of State Colin L. Powell out of the Cabinet Room when Mr. Powell showed up a few minutes late — and ended on time. In the Obama White House, meetings start on time and often finish late.",1233242444

YouTube is not the world. Many people never comment on YouTube. (For the record, look at the comments on classical music. They're cultured and sophisticated an learned. Piano virtuosos comment on amateur videos giving tips. Isn't that incredible? My favorite pianist comments on videos on YouTube. That's marvelous.)<p><i>Insulting people is the rock 'n' roll of 2009, if you can't deal with it, well, there's a cable plugged into your wall that you can simply pull out.</i><p>Kind of a bizarre way of putting it. Isn't the idea that if you can't deal with insults, you just make a community with fewer insults? Freedom and all? Freedom <i>from</i> insults is also a potential solution.<p><i>You are reaching nobody, and nobody can hear your voice.</i><p>Right now, my professor is having a discussion about the suicide on Justin.TV, a YCombinator company. So here's one classroom that's been affected by something that I read on Hacker News.<p><i>What we have is a herd of elephants thundering down a slope, heading towards a world of extremely democratic and free speech, and a bunch of rabbits form a council on the side and decide that they choose that the elephants should all start walking the other way.</i><p>Wow. Not at all. If you think trolls are as powerful as elephants you've got to take another look at the world around you. If 4chan is considered powerful, then Google has to be looked at too. I'll take a million trolls to a company that's making a lot of people billionaires and is doing some social good with their work, too. I think the billionaires have a bit of elephant in them too.<p><i>This time it is that way, and very frankly, all these beard stroking and discussion about this will have little effect.</i><p>It's that way until somebody reading this decides to fix the problem. The cool thing about the Internet is that one person can change it all. And Hacker News is an incubator: it's a place for smart people to talk about things.<p><i>It will stay young, so if you want a place where everyone is grown up and civil, build a gate and hide behind the walls.</i><p>It's already old. The most-visited sites online are sites like CNN and Fox: the ancient bogies of the media. They won't last forever, but the sites that replace them will <i>not</i> be the Gawkers. The replacements will be just as civil and just as everyman-friendly.<p><i>And don't forget to tap hard on the walls when the rock 'n' roll music of the neighbours gets too loud.</i><p>Online it's more, ""If the music gets too loud you can always create an alternate universe where you dictate all the rules.""",1233242090

456404,comment,455637,455637,0,0,NoBSWebDesign,,,"I dual-majored in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at a 95% engineering school. Cheating occured very often, and I would venture to guess that a majority of the students cheated at some point during their college career, usually in the form of finding a ""crib"", or previous test from that professor and memorizing the answers.<p>In my opinion, the greatest cause for cheating was severely unrealistic expectations from the professors. They often expected a far greater amount of memorization and understanding than could possibly be accomplished in the amount of time given to learn the material.<p>When confronted, their answer was almost universally that ""you will have to know it in the real world, and people's lives could depend on your work."" However, this logic is severely flawed in that, in the real world, we are given more than 2 hours to complete a set of tasks. And we have the internet and textbooks at our grasp if we need a refresher on a specific equation or concept. And others will be checking our work, especially if people's lives depend on it.<p>This discrepency between professor expectations and real-world expectations I think gave many students the view, ""if the professors aren't playing fair, then why should I?""<p>As a result, I saw much much less cheating when the professors ""played fair"", meaning they made the tests open-book and/or open-note. However, there was probably also much less legitimate understanding of the material come test time. So, I'm not really offering up a solution. Just my observations.",1233241351

That means most of its content was geared towards illegality.<p><i>Another tought: would muxtape have been able to get a license similar to the one Pandora uses for it's service?</i><p>Probably not. Pandora's deal exists because it helps people find new music, and because people can't directly play whatever they want.

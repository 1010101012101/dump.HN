8659663,comment,8658283,8658283,0,0,fuligo,,,"I wonder if he would get this much positive attention if he wasn&#x27;t a Christian extremist. Would the article have conveniently left out his racism if he was, say, a militant antisemite instead of being focused on black people as he is? Would people admire his worship of a random number generator if he used it to spit out slogans of a religious text that isn&#x27;t as revered as the Bible?<p>While his schizophrenia probably comes with very bad episodes, there is absolutely nothing that can be found in his own words allowing for the conclusion that this view is just a tourette-like symptom. On the contrary. His violence-laden hate speech is one of the constant factors defining him. Contrary to what has been suggested here he doesn&#x27;t use slurs randomly and generically, either. There&#x27;s a story behind his views that is just as coherent as the cute &quot;god&#x27;s own programmer&quot; schtick.<p>Where his illness clearly manifests is the interpretation of random events all having a specific meaning. The radio talking to him, all the events in his life being <i>just so</i> that an invisible power is communicating with him, all the way down to <i>literally</i> a random number generator whose nature he cannot grasp. That&#x27;s schizophrenia. If there was an adequate cure or means of suppressing it, this world view would completely go away.<p>It&#x27;s more complicated to separate the man from the illness when it comes to pretty much anything else. At the very least I would be extremely hesitant to call him, as people do in this thread, an &quot;inspiration&quot;. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s safe to be in the same room with him.<p>Closing with a quote straight from his most recent account:<p><pre><code>  &quot;I spend my days clubbing retard-n$ggers. CLUB! CLUB! \n   DIE N$GGER! CLUB! RETARD! N$GGER! DIE!! CLUB! N$GGER!*&quot;\n</code></pre>\nHN&#x27;s majority opinion of this guy makes me more uncomfortable than his comments by themselves.

The corollary to this is that if something like this is published, it means it doesn&#x27;t actually work in practice.<p>I did a little bit of BTC trading, and I thought I had an interesting idea. I traded on one of the smaller exchanges, but uses Mt. Gox as the oracle to predict which way the price would move. The basic idea worked pretty well: there was correlation.

For example, an emotional framework, the aspect of having drives and &quot;desires&quot; that lead to &quot;illogical&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot; behavior and interactions with others - is that required or not? How can we begin to reason about a non-human-centric concept of intelligence?

We try to build these monolithic beasts that take in mounds of information and try to make sense of it all themselves. But (yes, relying again upon the only known implementation) a single human on its own will never achieve the modern sense of intelligent behavior.

I don&#x27;t think you did this deliberately, but it seems like a mistake to just assume &quot;stubbornly defiant&quot; == &quot;stubborn&quot;.<p>edit to elaborate: IMO, &quot;defiance&quot; is a positive trait, because you have to be willing to defy others in order to be able to assert yourself. In that sense, it is an integral part of self-confident action. On the other hand, unqualified stubbornness is a sign of insecurity in my opinion. People use &quot;stubborn&quot; as a positive descriptor, but my experience is that stubbornness is a mistake based on an assumption that changing your opinion or ideas makes you seem weak.<p>So, I for one would like to describe myself as &quot;stubbornly defiant&quot; but not &quot;stubborn&quot; in general. I am only stubborn with respect to a few key things which I think should never be permitted to be compromised, and one of those is my independence and self-determinism. But I am not stubborn about ideas or even beliefs.",1416945732

However, every country in the EU has different VAT exemptions for goods and services - harmonising that across EU nations would be extremely difficult. Politicians will have an impossible task persuading the public that goods and services that were never subject to VAT will now be taxed.<p>What the EU should have proposed is a common VAT rate across the EU for <i>digital goods</i>. (This could still include exemptions or reduced rates for certain goods such as e-books.) I suspect this would have faced less opposition from member countries and it would eliminate much of the bureaucratic and administrative burden these new laws introduce.",1416945685

As a general comment, this willingness to make a spectacle of misery seemed to come out of nowhere in 1999 with Who Wants to be a Millionaire. I'm sure classic game shows did this too, but in my lifetime this seemed to be a real turning point. '99 is also the year I threw away my TV, and I haven't regretted that.",1332187189

Reddit links to hardcore pornography (and mirrors it in thumbnail form) and has until very recently carried Child pornography. It is also a hub for extreme NSFL shock imagery.<p>You can argue that someone should provide a repository for Android apps that allow access to such things but I don't think you can fairly expect any particular company to put their name to promotion of that sort of content. Any company that wishes to remain with an appearance of respectability would probably do well to keep a large distance between themselves and reddit (and probably 4chan from what I've heard but I'm not that familiar with it - I've visited a couple of times and what I found was relatively tame compared to what I've seen on reddit, YMMV).<p>>'reddit is fun banned for ""sexually explicit material""'<p>That sounds like the correct analysis to me.",1332187179

3725884,comment,3724608,3725758,4,0,cryptoz,,,"Do you think that the military budget, at 20% of the federal budget, is worth every penny? If you want your social programs and non-space science research to get more money, it would be unwise to take that money from space science research. Much more wise would be to shrink the gigantic 20% military by .5%. When you compare NASA to the military, $10 billion is no longer ""real money"".<p>By the way, in 1997 most Americans thought NASA took about 25% of the budget. Not 0.5%-ish. So when arriving at the decision of what a ""lot of money"" is, compare it not to what you think but to what most people think and you'll find that NASA is vastly cheaper than the average person's expectations.",1332187151

In cases when people give these incorrect answers, it's always clear that they're just guessing, and when I tell them it's wrong they stress out and that's that. They refuse to even answer the n=3 case, because they've already given up.<p>The reason we found this a good filter is because people who are unwilling to think a little to give the right answer, are usually unimpressive in other parts of the interview, too.

It's <i>conceivable</i> (though very unlikely) that he met a 13 year old -- while the interpreter was distracted -- who spoke enough English to say she was 13.  However, when Ira asks him directly whether the supposed 13 year old said her friend was 12, or if he just assumed (i.e. fabricated) that she was, he has no answer.  It's the one place where he has absolutely nowhere to go:  he can't claim artistic license with retelling of factual news reports, and he can't claim the interpreter simply wasn't listening at the time, he simply talked himself into a corner.",1332187012

Mention of ""corporate culture"" implies the speaker is interested in control--and probably more interested in the control of behavior than technical subjects. The emphasis on corporate culture, team playing and company values indicates the extent to which management values will be imposed top down. The preference for platitudes over definitional clarity indicates a lack of candor and the intention to conceal motives.

In either case, I think your point holds that LLVM isn't substantially ""larger"" in any major sense of the word.<p>One confounding factor is backends.  On one hand, GCC has a <i>lot</i> more of them, which contributes to a larger source base, but shouldn't be considered a disadvantage out of hand.

Anecdotal evidence disclaimer.<p>I think there isn't so much a fear of failure as much as a fear of risk. I think people doing the startups aren't afraid of failure. It is their friends, families, and community that might not view taking a risk as an intelligent move. When I was discussing the side company that I was trying to start I was immediately dismissed by a few people. I think their mindset might still be in the brick and mortar style of business. Some people might take that negatively while others embrace it as a challenge. I'll show them!<p>One other thing that I've noticed is that there is a certain energy in some cities that I haven't found in St. Louis. There is electricity in San Francisco, Portland, Los Angeles, New York, and London that isn't there. One that feels to me that maybe the person sitting at the table next to you in the coffee shop might be a great connection. That you're always one chance meeting away from a great opportunity.<p>I'm not sure if Chicago is like this but many people in St. Louis (well into their 30s) still form opinions based on what high school you went to. In fact it often the first question out of their mouths after introductions. With my background I find that custom weird if not unhealthy.<p>Also, it does seem to me that people as a whole do get married earlier there than on the West Coast. At least among the people that I have met. Having a family and doing a startup is tough (particularly if it is on the side of a 9-5 job) but people make it work.",1332186591

So people will often upload pictures of handwritten notes, etc. which have some class but not everyone wants to go to that much effort.<p>The easiest thing is to offer a 612x612 template and the ability to show a PNG that users could then save to their Camera Roll and then upload to Instagram.

This example is good though.<p><i>""The whole point of GCC is to have a complete compiler toolchain where all the enhancements are being made available to _all_ end users."" ... ""the last thing I want to see is a situation where developers keep their enhancements proprietary.""</i><p>I believe you have correctly expressed a consensus opinion of why it would be 'bad' to allow proprietary plugins. And your claim posits a reason:<p><i>""(likely due to the wishes of their companies who see no gain in releasing those enhancements and instead wants to keep those enhancements as a competitive edge).""</i><p>Which is also a common reason given.<p>However what if there was a different reason? What if there is some capability that could be created with a plug-in that is pretty specialized, further that plug-in would require specialized domain knowledge and would only be of use to a small number of GCC users.<p>Traditionally the way the market has created such things is that a person invests their time to create the capability, and they charge a fraction of what it cost them to others to use the capability. The compute the fraction to offset the cost of developing it, and the community benefits by getting access to this capability for a fraction of what it would cost to develop in house, and the developer benefits by having the cost of their efforts covered by the community.<p>In a GPL world where the work would be considered derivative, you remove the opportunity for people to charge for their work, and thus you remove the economic motivation for getting something built. This damages the community as a whole with a somewhat 'invisible' ""didn't go there"" sort of damage (you only miss something if you had it and then you don't, not if you never had it). It is an unfortunate byproduct of GPL like licenses that they poison[1] the market for those specialized tools.<p>I completely understand the motivation behind the FSF and GCC communities for wanting to keep GCC available for all.<p>But you have to also note that people who sell software make very much the same arguments in defense of copy protection. They (the software producers) argue that they want everyone to have the same experience and they can't control that experience if people are out there making bootleg copies and changes they don't know about. So they deny something their customers want ""software unburdened by loathsome copy protection"" to preserve their stated goal of giving everyone the same experience with their software.<p>So if the FSF and GCC communities are denying something their customers want ""modularized GCC tools for easy customization through plug-ins"" in order to preserve their stated goal of giving everyone the same experience with their software, well it strikes me as ironic.<p>[1] Sorry for inflammatory way that sounds, my thesaurus is coming up blank on terms that mean 'something which kills an existing organism and keeps it dead'.

If it is ground floor and no work has been done your equity and vesting should look like their equity and vesting, if it does not then you should consider that a red flag.<p>As for the consultant title, I don't think it is a big deal until salary is involved, they are probably not wanting to carry employees on the books as their are all kinds of legal situations that arise from doing so, standard (I am not a lawyer disclaimer applies). For example if you are not drawing a salary then how do you comply with minimum wage for a w2 position, that is just one of many, it can be done but it takes effort to dot all the i's, there is a lot less to deal with if everyone is a consultant, and responsible for themselves legally. I have been part of several efforts where we where all S-Corps and had a blanket LLC that each S-Corp or consultant held ownership in, while it is not totally the norm, it is not unheard of. What does the other founders structure look like? Are they employees or are they consultants as well?<p>The bigger question is does your equity place you on the board of directors for the company? If it does not then you may want to consider carefully your position in the direction of the company and you ability to direct that direction.",1332185866

As for testing, even if they don't use it nothing prevents them from lying - and if you think lying about it is stupid - not using testing is also stupid - so it's likely a pattern in decision making. It works the other way as well, it's really easy to fake what the interviewer wants to hear with this sort of generic questions that don't touch on the things that actually matter to the job (and I would say that the only reason to resort to these kind of questions is because you can't ask insightful technical questions, ie. talking about a previous project and the persons involvement/duties will allow you to collect actual information about the person, but you need to be able to understand what he was doing to evaluate it).<p>Questions and evaluations like these are things that HR people sell to management to make themselves appear useful without actually having skill to meaningfully evaluate the candidate, ""corporate culture"", ""team player"", ""company values"", etc. are all vague buzzwords with no quantifiable metrics behind them, but they are simple to pound on with simplistic intuition and anecdotal evidence. Even if the supposed attributes were somehow meaningful from my experience companies that focus on that sort of talk when interviewing end up with exactly the kind of people you would want to avoid - bullshiters with nothing to back their talk, that usually end up hijacking some part of the system by introducing random bullshit that only they can wade trough - to ensure job security.

It's _very_ hard to raise vc out here. We like it that way (at least I do). There, I said it.  The pie in the sky bay area nonsense ideas just don't hold water here. Nor should they there, but they do.  Twitter couldn't happen in the midwest, it shouldn't have happened anywhere else either.<p>2. Stealth mode. anything you do here is stealth mode.

As a midwestern startup, you need business presence on one or more coasts, so there are significant efficiencies to be gained by moving your entire operation there.  Unfortunately, everyone else has the same idea, so rents are huge, and the giant money you have to pay the local talent just winds up in landlords' pockets in the end.<p>5. If you can do startup-y stuff from the midwest, for coastal clients, you will live like the king of france, in your giant, and incredibly cheap house.<p>6.

Many midwestern families haven't lived on farms for hundreds of years. Just thought I'd mention it.<p>10. Working insane hours just means you're young.

But government sponsored space programs pursue valuable goals private organizations never can.<p>If you believe in the value of science and the importance of humanity becoming a multi-planetary species, I think you have to support government funded spaceflight. No private company would have had the incentive to make the Hubble or Spitzer telescopes a reality, and they have given us unparalleled insight into the nature of the universe.  Because companies have to operate with budgets that demand profit or death within a small amount of time, they will never send probes to investigate other planets, the outer reaches of space, and invest in experiments that may not prove their value for decades.  The exploration of space is going to be a long journey, and it requires organizations that can handle long-term goals.<p>It's also naive to think that SpaceX and other private space companies would even exist without NASA.  Their largest contracts are with NASA right now because there is no profit in spaceflight outside of government contracts, space tourism, and satellite launches.  And SpaceX engineers say themselves that they owe their success to the designs and knowledge of the early NASA programs which they copy (Very well designed spacecraft with lessons NASA has forgotten).  Many designs on Falcon 9 are taken directly from the old Apollo missions, with improvements [1].  In most technical revolutions, large-scale accessibility comes only after a path is paved by a central power.  Computers and the internet came to the masses after decades of investment by the military.  The only reason jets became the new standard so quickly after WWII was because of development in the war.  And when SpaceX goes to Mars, it will be thanks to the wealth of knowledge NASA exploration missions created over decades.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gizmag.com/date-set-for-spacex-dragon-launch/208"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gizmag.com/date-set-for-spacex-dragon-launch/208</a>",1332184398

The Micro Cloud is a stand-alone instance of the Stackato system running in a single VM. This lets you push your apps to an environment that is functionally identical to a full PaaS cluster. ActiveState Stackato gives you 3 ways to test your application (1) on a Stackato Micro Cloud, (2) with an Amazon EC2 AMI or (3) on their Private Stackato Sandbox Service. check it out at <a href=""http://activestate.com/cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://activestate.com/cloud</a>",1332183845

More white space, in other words, is rarely a bad thing. Inline braces decrease white space and make unfamiliar code harder to scan, so to me they're Not Good.<p>Also wow, I didn't know it was even possible to write Python without spaces. Are we talking no spaces in arguments, like<p><pre><code>    def func(arg1,arg2):\n        print ""Indented""\n        return\n</code></pre>\nor full-on no spaces?<p><pre><code>    def func(arg1,arg2):\n    print ""Not indented""\n    return\n</code></pre>\nI thought the latter was prohibited.",1332183828
3725575,comment,3725288,3725288,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"VC. Or, lack thereof. What VC there is goes into older, more established companies and founders.<p>There isn't a lack of talent. Far from it, in my experience. (Actually, I think Minneapolis and Chicago would be great places to start a startup, on account of talent and COL. If the three worst things about a place are December, January, and February, you live in a great location.) Nor is there a mentality problem among the people who would be founders. It's a funding and access problem.<p>It's not just Chicago, of course. This funding problem is the reality pretty much everywhere and for everyone except extremely well-connected, upper-middle-class kids in California.<p>If I had the money, though, I'd drop a wad of cash on a Midwestern city like Madison or Minneapolis and try to build a Silicon Valley there-- not that there's anything wrong with the existing one, but just because I don't think it's healthy to have most of our innovation in one or two locations, and a place with low COL and high QOL might be a great place to start trying to do something new and different.",1332183820

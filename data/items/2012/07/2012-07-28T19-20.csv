It takes disciplined study to develop the fluency to be creative in maths at a given level, but the discipline is a means to an end not an end in itself, and if it's so strong that people are discouraged by shame from asking the questions they need to ask to develop a deeper than rote understanding of the material, then it's got to be counter-productive.<p>I say this as someone who was almost put off maths for life by the latter approach, but is now doing a second masters in a mathematical field...",1343503974

4306250,comment,4305732,4306205,7,0,nostrademons,,,"FWIW, Google is my 4th employer, and I've been employed there for a bit under half my working life.  I took a gap year before college and worked with a bunch of my friends from high school on a dot-com, then I worked at a financial software startup for 2 years after college (where I learned I hated the financial industry), then I founded a startup for a year and a half with a friend from college.<p>Also FWIW, the degree to which I enjoyed those employers correlated very little with the amount of external success they had.  I really liked working with my friends on the dot-com, even though our funding got pulled after 3 months and our net new userbase (we started with an existing website) was negative.  I really liked working on FictionAlley, even though as a volunteer project I never made any money off it and as a Harry Potter fansite it's not like it resulted in much prestige.  I really hated working on financial software, even though it paid well and (to the outside world at least) seems complicated and prestigious.<p>There are definite perks to working at Google.  But in the grand scheme of things, from the inside, getting paid well and having your work viewed by billions of people are relatively minor ones.  They're akin to the free food and outrageous company outings: they make you feel good and remove some stress from day-to-day life.  The perk that makes the biggest difference in my life, I've found, is working in a friendly, trusting culture with good people who get shit done.<p>You can replicate that in a niche community much smaller and less influential than Google.  Hell, if it hadn't meant living with my parents, I would've been happy to work on FictionAlley indefinitely.",1343503922

What Qualcomm had was a contractual agreement protecting their customers from Samsung pursuing FRAND patent fees, but that contract expired in early 2011. So, now Samsung is using their FRAND patents in defense against Apple's thermonuclear patent war.",1343502697

Each lthread scheduler runs its own lthreads concurrently, or better said, one at a time. But from an observer's perspective they look like they are running in parallel.<p>Now if you create 2 pthreads on a 2 core machine and each runs an lthread scheduler then you have true parallelism because you can have 2 lthreads running in parallel at the same time. One by each scheduler.<p>I feel this is a closer context to what Rob is discussing than what I found in the comments here.",1343502570

As one of the countless others like me on Hacker News who started out their educations and careers with so much promise, all I feel anymore is this tremendous sense of failure and missed opportunity.<p>These days I think of programming the way I think of working out: intense bursts of focus on creativity for maybe 2-4 hours if I'm lucky, and then hours to days of melancholy because the tools and methodologies I'm using are all garbage.<p>Examples of mainstream trash: ios, objective-c, flash, php, c++, 802.11, usb, xml, html5, mpeg, mp3, dram caches, opengl, just on and on and on.  Literally every tool I use on a daily basis, every file format, every communication protocol, everything, all fatally flawed in some way.  My life has been an almost complete waste.<p>I don't know much about IDE/ATA but it must be quite a garbage dump to traverse.  Turning that into something clean like a socket/file reference is remarkable.  Just think of all the things that don't work on hard drives: how they fail to write the last bit of data in a power failure or maintain directory consistency, how they were so far behind on caching and hybrid flash/platter drives, just on and on, a tower of babel of remarkably cheap but inadequate hardware.  Dealing with that, and the layers of politics that perpetuate such monstrosities would be enough to drive a person mad.<p>Thank god I'm not depressed though.  I was severely out of it from 2000-2010 for a lot of obvious reasons but I finally let everything go and have never been happier.  I.  Am.  Not.  Depressed.  It's glorious to say, I feel it all the way to my core.  Life can turn around, and one day you'll wake up and realize that you don't give a crap about solving the world's problems anymore, because it's all too far gone.  It's not your fault.  Just find your niche and reach some level of sustainability, and save the world later.",1343502478

But give it three years. What if Linux actually becomes the chief gaming environment? I can certainly see indie developers pushing Linux, or at the least offering Linux versions, as Steam currently offers both Win+Mac versions of games.<p>Given Linus' own recent comments about gnome, maybe some new attention is exactly what's needed for a new desktop environment to spring forward? And considering the freeform nature of Valve, I wouldn't be amazed to find out that some of the internal focus on the rumored ""SteamBox"" console/PC turns into a new Linux desktop.<p>And what happens with MS? Do they chiefly become a device pusher like Apple? Are they even prepared for this fight?",1343502040

313352,comment,313041,313111,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The beauty of this kind of job is that they are throwaways.  You don't put them on your resume, and you don't care if the pay sucks, as long as the hours are good for you, and you can leave when you've had enough of it.  Since you'd probably be willing to work weekends (since your real job keeps you occupied during the week), you'll likely be able to take your pick...and since everybody is more leisurely and chatty on the weekends, that is likely to work in your favor.<p>If it were me (and I were your age), I think I'd try for a coffee shop, bookstore, or Apple store, around the school.  I've heard that bicycle couriers are ""swimmin' in women"", but it seems like it'd be hard to get enough daily interactions with women your age to make it worthwhile...I think maybe there's some fantasy element at work there.  It'd get you in great shape, though, so it's got that going for it.  Which is nice.<p>Also, don't rule out non-work type situations that get you into crowds.  Volunteering is a great option, for example.  If the money isn't a big deal to you, volunteering will crank up your real world karma, at the very least, and that's always a win.<p>In any of these situations, you're <i>expected</i> to be friendly and chatty and you have numerous stock lines that always work and are not considered trite, which helps with the introversion (I'm guessing you're an introvert, since you've made it through high school and some college and don't really know how to meet girls--I've been there).  All you then have to do is hone your senses for when the friendliness being returned is greater than the usual.  I've always been much better at detecting the cues in face to face conversation than from across the room or in large group situations, perhaps it'll be the same for you.  And you'll get better at it every time you meet someone new.",1222249846

Its not to hard to see why the apps are low quality. Its a symptom of the iphone app market.<p>The console game industry has the cure to this but it isn't pretty: $30k dev kits,  minimum funding/budget requirements, and long approval processes<p>Personally I would rather stick with the current apple approach. The crap apps are cheap (or free) and if you have the guts to make a serious app its easier to stand out.",1222249398

If you said ""learn to write SQL instead of abstracting stuff through a framework"" or even ""learn to mix cement and lay formwork"" - THAT would be useful.<p>Erlang, Scala (or dare i say it), Lisp - possibly not so much 'useful' as an academic pursuit.",1222248387

But it suits him down to the ground; this is a man who engineered a famine to starve his political opponents, remember. <i>Of course</i> he wants to be the only one in Zimbabwe who can even consider capital-intensive projects. So he can sit there and not do them.<p>Solution is for Zimbabwe to scrap its own currency and just use one of Dollars/Pounds/Swiss Francs/Yen/Euros.",1222248282

Surely we would be better improving the curriculum so that children have a better chance of learning to think critically and imaginatively about all classes of problems, rather than adding narrow vocational studies. A world where everyone is an entrepreneur in spirit may be utopian; a world where everyone is an entrepreneur in the limited sense that governments and educational systems think of them sounds utterly dystopian.",1222246944
313337,comment,313303,313303,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've generally used wire transfers...but US banks <i>suck</i> for wire transfers.  They look at you like you're speaking a foreign language.  I've found Washington Mutual here in Mountain View to be the best about it I've ever seen (which isn't to say they're good...just better), and they're the cheapest, as well, at $20/transfer.  Previous banks charged more (like $32-$40 per transfer), and acted like I was a crazy person for trying to give them a SWIFT code.<p>So, I hate doing wire transfers, but when PayPal and a US bank check is not an option, I've bucked up and done it.  I've heard that Western Union is a reasonable option, as well, for many overseas destinations.  I'm not sure if India is one of them.",1222246909

My approach is to simultaneously:<p>* write a simple web-scraper using SBCL, QuickLisp, closure-html, and drakma<p>* watch the SICP lectures<p>I think this is working well; I'm developing good 'Lisp goggles', in that I can now read Lisp reasonably easily. I'm also getting a feel for how the Lisp ecosystem works, e.g. Quicklisp for dependencies.<p>What I'm really missing, though, is a sense of how a seasoned Lisper actually works.<p>When I'm coding for .NET, I have Visual Studio set up with ReSharper and VisualSVN. I write tests, I implement, I refactor, I commit. Then when I'm done enough of that to complete a story, I write some AUATs. Then I kick off a Release build on TeamCity to push the new functionality out to the customer for testing & hopefully approval. If it's an app that needs an installer, I use either WiX or InnoSetup, obviously building the installer through the CI system.<p>So, my question is: as an experienced Lisper, what does your workflow look like? Do you work mostly in the REPL, or in the editor? How do you do unit tests? Continuous integration? Packaging & deployment? When you sit down at your desk, steaming mug of coffee to one side and a framed photo of John McCarthy to the other, what is it that you do?<p>Currently, I feel like I am getting to grips with Lisp coding, but not Lisp development ...",1294963016

If you have a nice syntax for passing the operations into the monad, that means there's going to be quite an aggressive transformation of the source syntax; and since the control flow - i.e. the calling of the functions passed into the monad - is determined by the monad, it's harder to analyse at a higher level.<p>If you have a powerful type system that's open enough to encode further guarantees in it, so that the library itself can supply higher-level proofs of properties (if not analyses that can e.g. be queried and manipulated in an IDE context), that's great; but it doesn't help in an environment like Javascript, or even Java or C#. And I'm not sure it helps in larger scale situations, e.g. debugging multiprocess interaction. With so much done in libraries, you run the risk of tools not knowing enough about the program to help.<p>I guess what I'm saying is that the case for ad hoc special cases is quite strong outside of situations where all your programmers are highly trained and have deep knowledge of all domains intersecting with their problems.",1294962070

I've figured out a relatively nice way to work around it. The solution goes something like this.<p>- Take the individual actions that you want and put them in closures.<p>- These closures take 1 argument, which is always a callback function that takes no arguments (this is the convention you structure everything around)<p>- Put these closures in an array, in the order that you want them executed<p>- Pass the array to a function that executes them for you (in Haskell it's called a sequence)<p>I have a really quick and really dirty presentation about it here, <a href=""http://www.moondust.dds.nl/text/async-presentation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moondust.dds.nl/text/async-presentation/</a><p>Some code on github up here, <a href=""https://github.com/michiel/asynchelper-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/michiel/asynchelper-js</a> - the sequencer.js function is verbose, if you read the next SO link I've included a three line example of implementing it.<p>And a stackoverflow answer using this code and some explanation here, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4462605/jquery-ajax-each-callback-next-each-firing-before-ajax-completed/4462955#4462955"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4462605/jquery-ajax-each-...</a><p>And another one as a gist on github here, <a href=""https://gist.github.com/604730"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/604730</a> (for rendering a massive table from JSON data).<p>There's a lot more to this sequencer pattern. You can nest sequences, you can have the sequencer run each callback using setTimeout(callback, 0) to release control back to the main loop and get out of 'script is doing too much' popups, etc.<p>Need to make an async call? Make a closure that performs the async call and invoke the callback argument in your async callback.<p>Need to add some random JS code to a sequence? Wrap it in a closure and call the callback when you're done. If the random JS code requires an async call, see the previous paragraph.<p>Error handling, of course, is still awful. You can extend the sequencer convention to add error closures as a second parameter, you can do everything inside the closures in try/catch blocks and finally always call the callback, etc. But that just tends to make a mess of things. So the examples just assume everything is going fine.<p>It's not an ideal solution, but it's native JS and works <i>everywhere</i>.<p>It allows you to structure your code into functional blocks and work on them separately instead of making everything one big nested callback mess.",1294961974

It can drive a person nuts (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2101210) ... until you decide to just grab a couple functions that help you express yourself.<p>That's what I wanted to offer HN. These are the functions that I use all the time in Javascript applications.<p>The first one is called ""pipe"" and it basically lets you express yourself simply by saying ""wait until objects X and Y are available, and then do something)<p><pre><code>  var p = Q.pipe(['user', 'stream], function (params, subjects) {\n      // arguments that were passed are in params.user, params.stream\n      // this objects that were passed are in subjects.user, subjects.stream\n      mysql(""SELECT * FROM subscription WHERE user.id = "" + params.user.id + \n          "" AND stream.id = "" + params.stream.id, this.fill('subscription');\n  }, ['user', 'stream', 'subscription'], function (params, subjects) {\n      // now we have all three objects ready to be used\n  }, function () {\n      // execute this function every time something is piped\n  });\n  mysql(""SELECT * FROM user WHERE user_id = 2"", p.fill('user'));\n  mysql(""SELECT * FROM stream WHERE publisher_id = 2"", p.fill('stream'));\n</code></pre>\nand the Q.getter function takes a regular getter and enhances it with queue support, throttling, and batching.<p>All you have to do is do:<p><pre><code>  Users.get = Q.getter(Users.get);\n</code></pre>\nand now you can use it from anywhere like this:<p><pre><code>  Users.get(29381, function (user) {\n     // do something with the user\n  });\n</code></pre>\nwithout having to worry about who else has requested the same user. If the user is cached, the tail call occurs right away. Otherwise, the function calls the ""real"" getter to fetch it. If someone else requests the same user, they are placed in a waiting queue. When the user is finally fetched, ALL the callbacks are invoked. Not only that, but you can also tell it to throttle on a resource. Just use a string or an object for the throttle. And it will make sure there are only 10 open requests at a time. And also you can implement batching.<p>https://gist.github.com/778822 <-- here it is<p>Anyway, check it out.

When I use email (as opposed to IM, Twitter, etc.) I'm usually discussing technical or business-oriented topics. Precision and context are very important in these discussions, and the emails are often significantly longer than might be common in personal communication. With top-posting, each point or answer is divorced from its context, which can force the reader to jump back and forth in the text to fully understand what's being said, increasing the chances for confusion. Interleaved posting allows me to act as an editor: I remove parts of earlier emails that are irrelevant to the current discussion, group quoted text with the corresponding reply, and add spacing or reorder fragments as needed to improve clarity. I find that in the end, this makes the discussion much easier to follow for the recipient.<p>For me, the bottom line is that when a misunderstanding could waste much more time than it would take me to do a little editing, the interleaved style really makes sense. When I use email, this is usually the case, since I usually use other mediums for personal communication.<p>[1] I can't help but think of this privately as: does this discussion have the Markov property?",1294960554

If a site has too many ads and loads too slowly, I simply won't visit there.<p>The key though, is having a tasteful amount of advertising. There's nothing worse than loading up a site with a dozen slow-loading ads that makes your system slow down. Look at Reddit as a great example of how to advertise. One text ad and one picture ad per page.<p>Facebook has 2-4 ads per page, which is sometimes a bit much, but at least they load fast.

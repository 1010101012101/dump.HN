2593924,comment,2591845,2593826,4,0,ryan-allen,,,"> Compared to the Rube Goldberg nature of some of these stacks of servers and protocols, PHP is delightfully simple, conceptually.<p>I agree that what you could call it's deployment API (or whatnot), that it is very simple. I think the reason for it's success is it allowed HTML/CSS 'programmers' to progress to simple scripting within their existing deployment metaphor (upload via FTP, use a PHP file extension, wrap PHP in <?php tags).<p>However, there's no reason that you couldn't design a similar thing in say, Ruby or Python, where people upload files with a specific extention FTP and it runs some templating language (like ERB or Pythons equivalent). You'd need some web api to allow triggering reloads of files (or reloads on every request if the server is being used for development).<p>PHP out of the box re-parses _every single script on every single request_, which is what you'd expect a development environment to do, but 'in production' that's what PHP has always done.<p>Hence were born the optcode caches (which work rather well now), like APC. But still, on every request, every file that is required has a stat performed on it (you can turn this off, though).<p>It's all very lowest common denominator, and the high end stuff is severely lacking and poorly documented. It's possible to have the best of both worlds (well designed language, pragmatic libraries and toolset out of the box, simple deployment AND well defined high end high traffic considerations), but PHP ain't it.",1306558150

2593922,comment,2593715,2593829,2,0,zalew,,,"Most of regulations on certain fields come from the fact that it's users are operating on a finite number of resources and areas, which do not expand proportionally to the userbase growth. Second of all, there often aren't efficient ways to avoid unwanted interactions, such as tools letting users selectively exclude the content of those environments.

2593870,comment,2593715,2593715,8,0,simonsarris,,,"I actually end up use the above description, ""Internet as Wild West"" quite a bit when trying to explain the internet to computer-illiterate people, because for some reason their skepticism filter fades away and they become all-too-trusting when the medium is something they are unfamiliar with. They seem to think that if someone was able to get something posted on the internet, well that person must certainly be a smart being in a position of goodwill.<p>Sure the internet functions as an information superhighway. It also functions as a den of thieves and swindlers, and people who elevate scams and pseudoscience to the look and feel of accurate information through mere the power of website presentation.<p>I have to tell my mother that just because something is on the internet doesn't mean it is <i>important</i> or <i>true</i>, and it certainly doesn't mean that the author necessarily has good intentions. I <i>want</i> her to consider it a Wild West.<p>The article accuses the narrative of sticking because it is ""compelling"" in the fanciful way, but I think the counter-argument here is the same problem. In many ways the internet <i>is</i> a Wild West. I think the argument is much more nuanced than saying it's not. I think the harder argument needs to be made with the wild west aspect as a given, but that an authoritarian clamp would make it a worse-off place.",1306556003

Nothing for free, just a billboard.<p>People would use the service as a help when deciding where to eat everyday, and chains would benefit from their traffic (again, like in print).  No stupid games like being a major of nowhere or silly prizes like one free beer on the 31st of february at 8am only.<p>I was going be the most happy user since I would be using it every day going for lunch with my coworkers, everytime the same question arises, where to go today? tgi fridays? ruby tuesdays?<p>To make the story short (too late, I guess) we ran out of runway (a very short runway indeed) and my cofounder and I decided to abandon the project for now, with the hope of someday pick it up again when better times came.<p>As I said, I love the idea. Groupon et all don't tell me what's new at panera bread or even mcdonalds and I really want to know (there is a real need)<p>Am I crazy? out of touch with reality? pipe dreaming?

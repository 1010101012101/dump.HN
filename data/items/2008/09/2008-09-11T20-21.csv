edit: I was avoiding introducing too many new acronyms, but I was suggesting CPA<p>Let's say you use some sort of program and get paid per lead - I would suggest CJ/Linkshare/Neverblueads[1].  Then track the ads well, see which work and fit in with your site.  Look for a clickthrough rate of at least 0.10% (although depending on how you display/cycle the ads this could be off).  Then from there look to have a conversion rate of definitely better than 1/10, aim for about 1/3.<p>If you work in those numbers (probably your first attempt will be about half that), you will make more than PPC.  You will also completely control how you serve ads and not be bound by the conditions of something like adsense.<p>I used to work for a major website, and they tended to make more per click on their ad campaigns that were revenue sharing than PPC as well.<p>Because of how behind the times the ad industry is in terms of AJAX sites, I really doubt you will find someone who allows you to change the ads in the method you desire.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.neverblueads.com/signup?ref=aff_66639"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neverblueads.com/signup?ref=aff_66639</a> if you want to signup (that would give me a referral).

Pattern-matching really shines when you need to destructure the argument, then do something similar to the result regardless of which case resulted in the destructuring.

If you want to validate the feature set or your market positioning, do a <i>closed</i> release.<p>A lot of people tend to underestimate the importance of the initial public release. It is a single, most important <i>natural</i> milestone in the lifetime of a product, so it needs to be handled with an utmost care.<p>Staying in a stealth mode and keeping your product and its idea confidential has multiple benefits. Most importantly, it allows you to build a competitive entry barrier, which in turn gives you time after the launch to scoop up users and establish yourself as a leader on your target market segment. Disclose your idea too early and you will tip off your competitors, so by the time you have it polished and working, it already gets replicated.<p>The ""release-early, release-often"" is an open source mantra, it rarely applies to the competitive start-up environment.",1221163605

There are three factors I can think of that play into this.<p>The first is the genre you're writing/idea-using within. Academic scholarship has pretty stringent standards for citation, Dave Barry's humor columns, not so much.<p>The second is the degree to which you depend on the idea. If some idea is at the heart of your work, you should acknowledge it gratefully (and possibly pay license fees for it, depending on the idea's status in your jurisdiction).<p>The third is the degree of obviousness in your genre. You don't have to cite anyone to prove that 1+1 is 2, unless your name is Peano or Russell and you're working on mathematical meta-logic. Nobody owns common knowledge.<p>Because karma has been floating around as an idea on moderated-discussion forums on the Internet for a long time (since the Bronze Age of the Internet, if you will), it's pretty obvious. There are also pretty low standards for citation in the webapp world.<p>And if you want to go further back, who's to say Slashdot didn't steal ""karma"" after hearing ""Karma Police"" one too many times, and Radiohead had ""Instant Karma"" in the back of their head? And John Lennon there is obviously referring to a Hindu system of beliefs that was thousands of years old and will probably outlast all of us.<p>My point is that there is no way to be completely original.

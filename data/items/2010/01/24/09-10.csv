1073172,comment,1072407,1072903,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"I disagree that I’m putting words in warfangle’s mouth. He said, ‘The fact that they are so secretive about the negotiations as to eject and ridicule third-party observes proves that they are not acting in the best interest of said third party observers.’ I don’t think that it in any possible way proves such a thing at all, and I was making a guess as to the premise warfangle was assuming to arrive at such a statement.<p>You’ll note that I haven’t made any statement one way or the other regarding the treaty itself. You shouldn’t infer that I am for or against it based on what I’ve said. Yes, I do know the details have been leaked. You’re missing my point entirely, because the content of the treaty is completely irrelevant to what I’ve said. My point is simply that the fact that the treaty is being negotiated in secret has no bearing on the relative merits of the treaty itself. The secrecy is just an irrelevant procedural technicality of the negotiation process that’s being framed as some nefarious underhanded move that should invalidate the treaty. It’s being used as a scare tactic in place of debating the treaty itself. Argue for or against the treaty on its content, not how it was arrived at.<p>I’m perplexed at how it isn’t clear to people that the treaty is being negotiated in secret <i>precisely</i> to prevent just such a mob backlash as is occurring. And it’s not to prevent a backlash because there is some corporate/government conspiracy to control the masses at work. It’s because there are concrete procedural difficulties in negotiating something like this when the parties involved aren’t able to speak freely without having 6 billion rabid critics jump down their throats at every proposal.",1264326194

I do wonder about its ability to handle unexpected conditions, or for the scripter to know that these conditions exist in the first case.  For example, if the GUI changes based on the day of week, the script will probably either get very confused, or do the wrong thing.  I imagine there's some way to do conditionals (if you see this, then do thing 1, otherwise do thing 2) but it's hard for the scripter to discover all the possibilities.  Still, might be useful for some things.",1264326027

This is one argument to suggest why the duplication detection algorithm should not be tightened significantly - if a link has any real merit, and it's news rather than something old that someone has run across, then it has several chances of not being missed, becuase it will get submitted several times.<p>Earlier submissions of the same story also sank (mostly) without trace:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1071533"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1071533</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1071093"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1071093</a>",1264325735

1073160,comment,1072601,1073020,0,0,Psyonic,,,"It's not that I consider it unethical: it's not wrong, but it does seem like taking the easy way out, rather than making your product strong enough to stand solidly on its own. Then again, you can't always predict how things will play out. For instance, I don't think Apple intended for the iPod and later the iPhone to target the narcissist within, but as they became popular, they became status symbols, and it happened anyway (and less artificially).<p>To the latter half of your response, I'm working on it. Even if my original comment was a bit snarky, it was a still a prompt for conversation on the matter. I'm well aware of the popularity of things like this (Farmville, anyone?), and I'm trying to understand it.<p>I'd be interested in your response to my suggestion that people are much more obvious about this online. While people certainly do things for status in the real world, almost all would take offense if you gave them a gold star for getting a date. Why are people so willing to cede authority (judgment) to a website? The game element doesn't seem to explain it all.",1264325213

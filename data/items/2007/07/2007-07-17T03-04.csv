Just very recently someone posted ""Ask Reddit: what is the most beautiful code you've ever seen?""... <p>Knowing how much reddit dudes love LISP, Haskell, Ruby and Python, I was <i>very</i> surprised to see that almost exclusively everyone's favorite piece of code was written... you guessed it - in C.<p>",1184644774

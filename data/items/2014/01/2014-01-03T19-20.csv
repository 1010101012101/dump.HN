We&#x27;re talking about a fairly small number of companies. And then, we&#x27;re talking almost entirely on the private side. It hasn&#x27;t really affected the public market that much.</i><p>I could not have come up with a better way to express it. It seems like every time I look at HN, someone is crying &quot;bubble.&quot; If pressed to explain what constitutes a bubble, and why they&#x27;re crying it now, the answers usually involve citing some company (e.g. SnapChat, Twitter) or small number of companies with an insane valuation or financial transaction. &quot;That&#x27;s a bubble!&quot; they cry.<p>I&#x27;ll point out that this is nothing, <i>nothing</i> like the actual bubble of the late &#x27;90s/early-2000s, where the <i>public</i> was buying large amounts of stock in brand new, unproven (but public!) companies. Few or none of these companies had turned a profit. Many were disasters of execution (witness WebVan, which has become Steve Blank&#x27;s prime example of how <i>not</i> to run a startup). VC investment was at a peak. Founders actually expected that their business plans could be executed without modification.<p>The mindset has completely changed since the crash. Yes, sometimes you have to wonder what the heck the VCs are thinking, or why the SnapChat guy would turn down a multi-billion-dollar buyout offer. Twitter&#x27;s stock price seems unjustified, and Facebook&#x27;s did, too, at least at first.<p>None of that constitutes a &quot;bubble.&quot; As MA points out, &quot;bubble&quot; was short for <i>stock market bubble</i>. This is all private stuff, for the most part; few companies dare to IPO these days, compared to the &#x27;90s.<p>The cost of infrastructure has dropped massively, as well; no longer are you required to buy scores of servers just to host your website. One might even be able to host the whole thing on Wordpress. Servers are virtualized and therefore far more cost-effective. You don&#x27;t need to own the physical hardware. Bandwidth is far cheaper. There are free CDNs.<p>So: VCs have learned lessons from their &#x27;90s mistakes. So have founders. The price of entry has dropped dramatically, requiring far little investment; meanwhile, business model development has learned from software development so that companies learn to grow and change in order to find their audiences.<p>That is why there is no &quot;bubble.&quot;",1388778922

So what? OTOH, if the foreigner said &#x27;I never imagined I would meet <i>exactly 100 people</i> with blue eyes in this part of the world,&#x27; now everyone starts counting how many of their fellow tribespeople have blue eyes.<p><i>But argument II is still wrong.</i> The problem as stated says  one resident can see the eye colors of all other residents but has no way of discovering his own and that if anyone learns their own eye color, they commit suicide the following day. They live on because they are unaware of the frequency of blue-eyedness, forbidden by custom from discussing it, and so there is no consensus on whether incidence of blue-eyedness is 10% or only 9.9%.<p>When the foreigner says that the incidence is in fact 10%, 900 brown eyed people will each see 100 blue-eyed people at the tribal gathering, and will know that their eye color must therefore be brown, so all 900 of them commit suicide the following day. Likewise 100 blue eyed people 900 brown-eyed people and only 99 blue-eyed people, so they commit suicide too.<p>The basic problem is a good one, but this poor presentation robs it of any educational utility and IMHO will mislead people into thinking that Math Is Not For Them.

Therefore, while each blue-eyed person knows there are other blue-eyed people on the island, <i>neither knows if the other knows</i>. This is changed when the presence of blue-eyed islanders becomes <i>common knowledge</i>.<p>From there, you can expand k to 3.

Alice sees Bob&#x27;s blue eyes and knows that Blue ≥ 1, and vice-versa. But Alice thinks, &quot;What if I have brown eyes? In that case, Bob wouldn&#x27;t know that Blue ≥ 1.&quot; So, everyone knows that Blue ≥ 1, but nobody knows that everyone knows that. Then the foreigner comes along and tells them that, between Alice and Bob, Blue ≥ 1. Now Alice knows that Bob knows that Blue ≥ 1, and realizes that, if Alice has non-blue eyes, Bob will use the new information that Blue ≥ 1 to conclude that he has blue eyes, and therefore commit suicide on the next day. When he doesn&#x27;t, she concludes that she must have blue eyes, and commits suicide. Bob goes through the exact same logic as Alice.<p>Though the foreigner&#x27;s statement did not tell Alice anything new about eye color distribution, it <i>did</i> tell her something about Bob&#x27;s knowledge. The same goes for Bob, who learns about Alice&#x27;s knowledge.<p>The logic is a bit more difficult to talk through with three people, so generalizing it further is left as an exercise ;P It comes down to &quot;everyone knows that everyone knows that Blue ≥ 1&quot;, which the foreigner <i>also</i> contributes as common knowledge by making his announcement.

In other words, each object contains its own method list.  This fits well in languages which get to implement catch-all methods, like Ruby, and I couldn&#x27;t resist coding up a client that worked that way.<p>(There&#x27;s room for this sort of trickery in near-future ECMAScript too, with Proxy[3].  I would really like someone to do this and I would kind of like it to not be me.)<p>When you lay out your API according to that philosophy, and cache a few &quot;stepping-stone&quot; objects you&#x27;ll be traversing often, hypermedia APIs don&#x27;t seem so inefficient at all.<p>As to your last point: take a look at HAL[4].  It sits alongside a &quot;traditional&quot; API layout very nicely, essentially adding &quot;_links&quot; and &quot;_embedded&quot; which can be safely ignored by non-hypermedia clients.

Choose the laptop I&#x27;m least likely to miss in the case it gets stolen by JBTs, with respect to the functionality I require.<p>2. Wipe(1) the first 10MB of disk (has only ever been LUKS), then one /dev/urandom pass into the entire thing. (In retrospect, zeros may have been better than random)<p>3. Reinstall Debian, with a passphrase I don&#x27;t mind giving up. Sync over only files that I don&#x27;t mind giving up.<p>4. Go through Japanese customs - the only question asked was &quot;Are you with him?&quot; (friend in front of me).<p>5a. At this point, I possess a still uncompromised machine at the destination, with stored ssh host keys, etc. When (last-minute) prepping, this possibility didn&#x27;t quite occur to me. Not being prepared to take full advantage of this was regrettable.<p>5b. (If machine had been molested, I would have not logged into my privileged accounts at all. For the most part I didn&#x27;t have to anyway, but since I wasn&#x27;t fully prepared it came in handy once or twice)<p>6. For return, wipe first 10MB of disk again, then one /dev/zero pass to the entire thing (so there was no argument that I had encrypted data). Then mkdosfs on a whole-disk partition for derp-nothingness. (This was done with a Debian install image written to an old flash drive I had with me for the purpose. My only concern at this point is the hardware getting stolen.<p>7. Take hard drive out of laptop so that it is a separate device. This would most likely increase suspicion, but make them even less justified in stealing the whole machine (not that this would stop them).<p>8. Get waved through coming back through USG because laptop &quot;searches&quot; aren&#x27;t actually that common for people not on the primary watchlist (everyone is on the secondary watchlist). Still, I will do the same thing next time, and think it irresponsible to not.<p>There are of course improvements that could be made to this, including a small default-booting &quot;nothing to see here&quot; install, with file times etc automatically adjusted.

State-side, many bases are guarded by private contractors who had (for a time, this changed) the physical fitness requirement of having a pulse. Aircraft maintenance is a combination of public (military run depots, mostly staffed by a combination of civil servants and contractors) and private (NG or Boeing or whoever run facilities). Both have issues, but the latter is quite effective at lobbying to continue to get their incentive pay even after destroying an aircraft [1].

TONS of stuff on being a manager. the trouble is finding USEFUL, WORTHWHILE stuff. most of it - the vast majority of it - is drivel and derivative. find the gems.<p>myself, when i first became a manager i studied hard, i read tons of material and haven&#x27;t stopped because it&#x27;s a constant learning process. i studied three major subjects: managing people, managing projects, and leadership. they&#x27;re all core skills to being an effective manager. a fourth one - managing yourself - is often overlooked, but don&#x27;t skimp on it. self discipline and management will help you and the people who report to you immeasurably.<p>management is not about command but about responsibility: to the organization, to your boss, and to your staff. bdfh42 gets much of that right in his nutshell above. communication is a core concept, learn it and continually work on it. learn to delegate, learn to train, learn to plan, learn to trust - and earn trust. learn to lead.<p>a lot of my leadership lessons have come from military books lately, and one lesson i learned a long time ago from that field has stayed with me: complaints go up. never let your team hear you complain. you set the tone, you keep a positive attitude about things and people even if you&#x27;re grinding your teeth when you do. your example reverberates with your team, never forget that. it&#x27;s part of the responsibility.<p>harvard business review has a press and they have tons of books on management essentials worth studying. myself, i recommend their &quot;essentials&quot; books. they cherry pick articles from their magazine (which is also worth subscribing to) and put them together in a book. well worth it, and you can often find them cheap and used on amazon. here&#x27;s one example:<p><a href""http://hbr.org/product/harvard-managementor-management-essentials-package/an/7103BN-BUN-EN"" rel""nofollo"">http://hbr.org/product/harvard-managementor-management-essen...</a><p>i read a ton of peter drucker - and recommend his books wholeheartedly - and here&#x27;s his books i suggest:<p>- The Effective Executive: The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done - just because you&#x27;re not (yet) an executive doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t learn how to manage like one. this book taught me tons, and i recommend it to nearly any and all new managers i can.<p>- Managing Oneself - learn how to manage yourself, your time, your projects and everything else will come naturally.<p>- Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices - this is a tome but is the premier book of his, well worth the time you spend on it.<p>as for common pitfalls on being a first time manager they include failure to delegate, being too &quot;hands on&quot;, and not setting expectations right. a lot of this is covered in &quot;The Leadership Pipeline&quot; by Ram Charan, Stephen Drotter and James Noel. while a book about big orgs building succession pipelines, for a manager it&#x27;s really valuable because it teaches you what&#x27;s expected of you by your superiors, and common pitfalls - and how to avoid them.<p>one of my favorite early books on leadership was &quot;It&#x27;s Your Ship&quot; by D. Michael Abrashoff, a former navy captain. tons of great stuff in there that dovetails with the above well.<p>these are just some of the things i&#x27;ve read and shared with people over the years, and they&#x27;ve been extremely valuable. i spent my own money to read these and hours every night on my own and it has helped me become effective and grow. none of us are born knowing how to manage people, so study it like you would anything else new.<p>finally: ask for training. if your org has promoted you, ask for management training for yourself and the others around you. a couple of two day seminars will do wonders for your organization. the price is pretty reasonable, too.<p>> Stand by all of your team<p>too true: be a shit umbrella, not a shit funnel. when things happen, be the shield between your part of the org and the problem. follow up - with the individual(s), the team, and yourself - to see what went wrong and what you can learn. but never forget you should be a shit umbrella and shield your org from crap above.",1388776256

Instead it&#x27;s filled with middlemen whose children will only eat if they can convince you to pay more for the car than a more efficient market would allow for.<p>If you watch the movie &quot;Suckers&quot; you&#x27;ll understand the &quot;asshole&quot; culture of car sales.

Basically you&#x27;d have to offer me over $175k to even <i>consider</i> coming there... and even then I&#x27;d be concerned about continued real estate inflation pricing me out of any chance of getting desirable housing and paying it off in a decent amount of time.<p>The other thing is that in Silicon Valley you&#x27;re paying for RE like it&#x27;s New York but you don&#x27;t live in New York.

The demo video showed an 8-rotor drone, I can imagine that building it as a pair of parallel quad rotors from the power supply point of view would give you quite a bit of control even at a 50% loss. A single-engine loss is obviously fairly small beans. I&#x27;m emphatically not an expert so this is armchair engineering.<p>- I don&#x27;t know why anyone would ask this question. The answer is trivially obvious (the operator of the drone, whichever legal entity that ends up being modulo whatever insurance they certainly have). Obviously &quot;it could crash&quot; is hardly novel in other delivery services and yet they seem to survive the liability question without issue.<p>- Probably quite dangerous. I imagine you want to fly quite high for cruising for obstacle-avoidance and noise anyway so 90% of your distance this isn&#x27;t a problem. I think the answer here is &quot;don&#x27;t hit people&quot; just like with existing forms of transportation (or more realistically &quot;be as careful about not hitting people as your liability insurance continues to reward you for&quot;).",1388775607

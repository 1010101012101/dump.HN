Overall, just have fun and learn JavaScript :)<p>ES5 is the current standard in all major browsers, so using its functionality could be considered &quot;safe&quot;.

9836215,comment,9835325,9836036,0,0,dbpokorny,,,"> This is going to make a great case study in the future on how to manage the relationship with user generated content sites<p>By providing members of the general public with quality news aggregation and community management tools, Reddit has thrown a wrench into the gears of public relations, which today still resembles the model Edward Bernays outlined back in the 1920s. (Aside: I highly recommend &quot;Crystallizing Public Opinion&quot; for anyone who cares about PR. It is sill relevant after 90 years.) For decades there was a gaping chasm between the general public and public figures, their representatives, and little need to revolutionize the field. Today that chasm isn&#x27;t closing gradually; it&#x27;s collapsing with enormous force. The bubble is bursting.<p>On Reddit, it just doesn&#x27;t matter how much money you have or how much you&#x27;ve invested in the community or how much perceived legitimacy you have outside Reddit; anytime you make a comment, you&#x27;re throwing yourself to the lions. Lions who upvote the most caustic, brutal, and incisive questions they can come up with, focusing the community&#x27;s attention and demanding more of public figures in a way no one could have predicted in 1995 or even 2005.<p>Do you know what happens when you type &quot;reddit new york times&quot; into Google? The top result is /r/nytimes. As a subreddit, it is essentially dead. Do you think it would be dead if the New York Times did not have its own user-generated commenting system? Do you think the New York Times would like to remain in control of its own user-generated commenting system? Of course it would. The point I&#x27;m arguing is that Reddit, by its very nature, has helped push the New York Times to adopt a policy of accepting user comments, and many other news sources have followed suit. Of course this point is impossible to prove, but even if there is merely a grain of truth to it, the implications are that those who own the news business are no longer living in a unidirectional media world.<p>The larger argument is that Reddit (and its predecessors such as Slashdot and Digg of course; I&#x27;ve unfortunately unintentionally marginalized their role in this comment), by its very nature, has systematically and irrevocably altered the public&#x27;s expectations for online participation and engagement. There is much more going on here than textbook case studies.",1436147980

But one thing I find strange is that &quot;.then()&quot; creates a new promise, but with no way to reject it.<p>ie. I can&#x27;t write:<p><pre><code>  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Do some stuff, call resolve()/reject() on success/failure.
  }).then((step1Val, resolve, reject) => {
    // Do some stuff, call resolve()/reject() on success/failure.
    // But this doesn&#x27;t actually work, because the &quot;then&quot; callback
    // doesn&#x27;t get resolve/reject as args.
  });

    // Do some stuff, call resolve()/reject() on success/failure.

That is - you have a branch_commit instruction, and anything between the branch and the branch_commit is treated as (a) branch delay slot(s), with the processor either filling in pipeline bubbles or stalling the branch as necessary. If you want to get fancy about it you can start doing matched branch / commit pairs (like nesting brackets), or potentially even start dealing with general matching.<p>Although the decreased instruction density may kill the benefits.",1436147722

This money was owed to government and private banks in the U.S., France and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the U.S. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.<p>An important term of the agreement was that repayments were only due while West Germany ran a trade surplus, and that repayments were limited to 3% of export earnings. This gave Germany’s creditors a powerful incentive to import German goods, assisting reconstruction.&quot; [1]<p>[1]<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Agreement_on_German_External_Debts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Agreement_on_German_Ext...</a>",1436147231

But let&#x27;s not lose all sense of nuance; I think beatings for a first offense are a little disproportionate, unless the first offense is itself exceptional.<p>1. <i>This is vigilantism!</i><p>No, this is a community choosing to police itself in a more vigorous fashion than has previously been the rule. Vigilantes, historically speaking, tend to (literally and figuratively) shoot first and ask questions later, if at all. I think that&#x27;s wildly disproportionate here, and that the mere suggestion of potential real-life consequences, for this sort of malbehavior, will almost certainly produce a remarkable change in the extent of bullshit that women in our industry find aimed in their direction.<p>2. <i>This is a problem for the police to handle!</i><p>Let me know when they start!<p>3. <i>Doxxing is a crime!</i><p>Some actions which might be taken in the course of a doxxing attempt are crimes, to be sure. But you might be surprised how much you can lawfully, with a little effort, learn about someone who doesn&#x27;t put a lot of thought into anonymizing himself because, after all, who&#x27;s going to come after him for something as trivial as trying to chase someone out of an entire industry because she happens to be female?<p>4. <i>Assault is a crime!</i><p>Oh, certainly. I think it&#x27;s entirely possible to have a reasonable conversation with someone, in the course of which is offered advice on patterns of behavior which would be frankly better for everyone involved, without trespassing into the realm of assault proper.<p>5. <i>Battery is a crime!</i><p>It sure is. And, of course, all dry sarcasm and deadpan humor aside, I would absolutely never encourage anyone to commit a crime.<p>On the other hand, I grew up in a place and a time where anyone who behaved in too excessively unacceptable a manner did so at risk of receiving more than merely verbal chastisement from the members of his community; put simply, someone who made himself enough of a stench in the nostrils of his fellows, for long enough, could expect them eventually to respond to his misbehavior in vigorous enough fashion to leave bruises.<p>In no small part as a result, the place and time where I grew up were, and the place largely remains, known for the politeness and courtesy characterizing social interaction there, and such methods as I allude to above are hardly ever actually necessary in practice; for the most part, the simple knowledge that such a response <i>might</i> occur suffices to prevent it actually needing to.<p>Granted, very few in the tech industry have personal experience of such robust social interactions, and I think I don&#x27;t go too far in saying that there&#x27;s a certain squeamishness around the subject. On the other hand, given that nothing else yet tried has worked worth a damn, I think we&#x27;d be short-sighted to dismiss such ideas entirely out of hand.<p>6. <i>Two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right!</i><p>Perhaps, but I&#x27;ve never understood the perspective from which it is wrong for members of a given society to correct misbehavior which fails to live up to that society&#x27;s avowed standards.<p>Of course, given the rather pathetic extent of our industry&#x27;s accomplishments in preventing the kind of behavior under discussion here, anyone could be excused for imagining that, collectively, we don&#x27;t give as much of a damn about this kind of abhorrent behavior as we claim we do.<p>7. <i>Women don&#x27;t need this sort of white-knighting from men in the industry!</i><p>Perish the thought! Frankly, I am too often embarrassed and ashamed to admit myself a member of an industry where behavior such as this is acceptable to <i>any</i> extent -- even by the people who actually engage in it. That I should, even in jest, feel myself moved to write a comment like this one, is frankly mortifying.<p>Put simply, if our industry were composed of the professionals we flatter ourselves it is, I wouldn&#x27;t have written this and you wouldn&#x27;t be reading it. If you feel yourself personally insulted by that statement -- good! You should, because you, too, bear a share of the responsibility for letting such abhorrent behavior run effectively unchecked.<p>There&#x27;s too much of that behavior, too widely spread, for anyone to argue that it&#x27;s &quot;just a few bad apples&quot;. Our industry has a problem. As members of that industry, we have a responsibility to address it. Some of us are trying to live up to that responsibility. Most of us aren&#x27;t. I&#x27;d like to see that change.<p>8. <i>But this kind of response will just make things worse! Even if you do confront this scum in person, they&#x27;ll just take it out on the women they&#x27;re already abusing.</i><p>That&#x27;s not impossible, but I think it&#x27;s also not at all likely. It&#x27;s long been recognized that anonymity is tremendously empowering, for good or ill; the perceived absence of risk seems to be what drives a lot of the venom we see directed at women in our industry. Too, if anonymity weren&#x27;t a major enabler here, we would see the people who spew this filth doing so under their actual identities, and likely in public, as well.<p>That being the case, I think taking that cloak of anonymity away should have a very strong effect on the people who engage in this kind of behavior. In short, I should think it&#x27;d scare the hell out of them!<p>It&#x27;s one thing, after all, to talk shit when you <i>know</i> you won&#x27;t ever have to live up to it. It is quite another to talk shit when you can be reasonably sure that you will. In my own experience, and in my observations of others, this latter condition tends to result in a healthy degree of circumspection, something I think is long overdue here.<p>9. <i>But you can&#x27;t change people&#x27;s minds this way, only their behavior! They&#x27;ll still find ways to mistreat their female colleagues -- they just won&#x27;t be able to be as overt about it.</i><p>True enough, but also an example of the perfect as an enemy of the good. And besides -- honestly, if someone&#x27;s an asshole enough to do this kind of shit, he&#x27;s <i>already</i> using whatever other methods of abuse he has at hand. Just because we can&#x27;t take all of them away at once doesn&#x27;t mean that taking away a cheap, easy, and disproportionately filthy one isn&#x27;t worth doing.<p>--<p>And, of course, there are all kinds of hairy details I haven&#x27;t addressed here, not least because I&#x27;d like to think I can keep at least one or two people reading all the way to the end. Lest we forget, this comment is written entirely in jest, and any extent to which you take seriously anything herein is entirely your responsibility.<p>Even if you think it&#x27;s totally stupid and wrongheaded, though, I&#x27;d take it as a favor if you respond by offering a suggestion which<p>a) hasn&#x27;t been already tried and found useless,<p>b) offers some prospect of success, and<p>c) isn&#x27;t just more of us all sitting around beating our gums about how terrible this is, while largely not bothering to try to <i>do</i> a damn thing about it.<p>Come on! This is our industry. This kind of rampant shitty behavior is our responsibility. It&#x27;s up to us to find something effective to do about it, and <i>do</i> it. Sure, I&#x27;ve made a stupid suggestion, but at least I&#x27;ve made a suggestion. If you want to tell me my suggestion is stupid, great!

Women are an easy target for several reasons:<p>1. Isolation. Women are a minority in tech and there&#x27;s a larger social stereotype that women can&#x27;t do math/are incapable of advanced reason/whatever tosh you want to throw in here. That means it&#x27;s easier to tell women they&#x27;re trash and undeserving and have them believe it. There&#x27;s not a lot of people most women can go to to complain about this or receive validation that these are poisonous lies without triggering <i>another</i> stereotype, being weak and vulnerable.<p>People would rather sit in silence and take it than be seen as a whiner.<p>2. In performance oriented cultures it&#x27;s very common to shit on each other as an in-group building behavior. People who can &#x27;take it&#x27; are the in group and people who get offended are the out group. Bullies can exploit this by knowing exactly how far they can push and make it seem like good natured ribbing even in a public social context. More subtle bullies can take things further by establishing unique contexts for minor slights to give them greater meaning that isn&#x27;t there for other people, so that when the victim complains they seem irrational and crazy to observers. (<i>Another</i> stereotype of women.)<p>3. Cultural factors. All those stereotypes regardless of how much truth there is to them become self fulfilling prophecies. Women are weak and vulnerable is essentially an advertisement for bullies to go target women, bullies <i>enjoy</i> hurting women more for reasons that could be basically summed up as actual misogyny.<p>As for harassing men as well, they <i>do</i>. They just use different words when they do it. It might be helpful to throw out terms like &#x27;women-hating&#x27; or &#x27;misogynist&#x27; and zoom out a bit to look at the ways bullies hurt people in different contexts. Bullies don&#x27;t care who you are, they will hurt anybody who will give them the warm fuzzies of having gotten someone. And to do that they will use whatever tactics or words will hurt.<p>These people use rape threats and death threats against women because they <i>hurt</i>. Women as a class are the most receptive to this sort of negative input for various cultural and yes physical reasons I won&#x27;t elaborate on. But bullies have all sorts of tricks to use on other people. If you&#x27;re a typical heterosexual male they&#x27;ll tell you you&#x27;re gay and unmanly. If you&#x27;re gay and proud they&#x27;ll tell you you&#x27;re deviant scum. If you&#x27;re a minority they&#x27;ll call you racial slurs and insult you with stereotypes. If you have visible pimples they will tell you you&#x27;re ugly. They will pick out whatever salient features are available to hurt you with and use them. It&#x27;s less helpful to think of a lot of these people as racists or what not so much as optimization processes for suffering and tears.<p>They don&#x27;t care who you are, they will hurt anyone.",1436145387

As you may know, about the same time we had our own problems and also had to be bailed out. As part of the measures put in place to reduce our deficit a massive tax hike was implemented in the end of 2012 [2]<p>I&#x27;ll draw attention to single one of those measures: the 3.5% extraordinary tax on the income paid by every single person with income above minimum wage (485€/month) including pensioners.<p>Now, for the money quote [3]: &quot;Minister of Finance Vitor Gaspar said the tax would bring in 1025 million euros&quot;.<p>Less than what Portugal contributed to the Greek bailout fund. 3.5% of the income of every citizen in this country.<p>In conclusion, that&#x27;s one of the reasons for the nationalistic outrage against Greece defaulting the loan. It is not only the money of the richest bankers of Europe that won&#x27;t be repaid, it is the taxpayer money of each of those countries that contributed to their rescue.<p>To put in perspective, 1102 million euros means that default would cost every inhabitant in this country 110 euros (about 330€ per household) and not only hypothetically but in practice too as demonstrated above.<p>EDIT: Changed second link as it was paywalled for the same news, but on CNN<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rekenkamer.nl/english/Publications/Topics/EU_governance_to_combat_the_economic_and_financial_crisis/Financial_stability_instruments/Financial_instruments/Greek_loan_facility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rekenkamer.nl/english/Publications/Topics/EU_gove...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/31/business/portugal-fiscal-tax-increase/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/31/business/portugal-fiscal-t...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/articles/other/governments-first-bill-taxes-christmas-allowance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/eurwork/article...</a>",1436145367

Well, according to many the way to recover is to make sure the state doesn&#x27;t spend too much. The public sector is way too big and inefficient. Many european voters were against plunging into depts so that the money could be sent to greece. European leaders did it in anyway, in part to save the banks. Everyone in the other euro countries is carrying a huge dept for you right now, thousands of euro&#x27;s even for newborns.<p>Even though the european leaders vowed to their voters that all their money was going to be paid back to them, Greece had to pay back less than the european voters gave due to low interest and generous installments. Some earlier debts were written off already.<p>Also, if Greece would have started to give the creditors slight hints that they were actually making the economy more healthy, than it would be easier for the euro leaders to break their pledges and forgive debts.<p>The current economy doesn&#x27;t suffer from the debts, it is suffering because it is structurally broken. Before Tsipras started to take over, the economy was getting better.
He increased government spending.<p>Even if all Greece&#x27;s debts were forgiven, it would still have the problem of a third world economy. RIGHT NOW Tsipras is asking for more money, because the economy is structurally not sustainable.",1436145130

Generally, someone willing to take the time to be nice and send in a detailed report, is willing to look for the best channel to send information through.<p>I start by looking through the &quot;About&quot; and &quot;Contact&quot; pages of the web application or service that I found the vulnerability on. If they have a reference to a bug tracking system, a system administrator, or a security contact, I send it there. If they are all emails, I usually send a message to all of them, to make sure that someone receives it.(If I don&#x27;t know who is going to get the message, I am initially vague on the vulnerability, and ask for a technical contact to forward the technical information to.) Otherwise, I look at whois information to see if there is a good technical contact. If I still haven&#x27;t found a good contact, I send a message to all of the emails listed in the RFPolicy. If all of those messages bounce, I send a message to any email address I can find for the domain. And once, I even called in to a sales line after all of this, and explained the situation. They got me in contact with &quot;Bob the website guy&quot;, to take care of the issue.<p>I have never received a bounty for any of these. I just want to do my best to make sure it gets taken care of.<p>> Would it be enough for me as a saas supplier to monitor security@myservice.com ?<p>I think this would be a good backup plan.

If you prefer them to send it via an HTTPS &quot;Contact&quot; page, say so, and most will see that and send it via that channel.

9836007,comment,9835433,9835543,0,0,leoc,,,"(I am not an expert on anything.)<p>It&#x27;s probably a bit unfortunate that this Piketty interview is getting prominence, because the whole question of analogies or disanalogies to Germany&#x27;s war-related sovereign debt problems is mostly beside the point. The most urgent disanalogy in Greece&#x27;s case is to what happens to just about every other country from A to Z that goes broke and needs to enter an IMF program. The SOP is for their pre-existing sovereign debt to be haircut as far as is necessary (if it is necessary) to make their debt burden clearly sustainable from then on, as a central part of the program designed and supervised by the IMF. This is what the IMF was designed to do from Day 1 and no-one, including Germany or any Eurozone core countries, is running around shouting that the IMF system is morally depraved, or a source of unacceptable moral hazard or a surrender to blackmail etc. etc. because it frequently results in program countries defaulting on a large chunk of their sovereign debts. And compared to the rogue&#x27;s gallery of mostly developing countries that enter IMF programs Greece is probably not exceptionally profligate, corrupt, structurally rigid, unreformable and so on.<p><i>Instead</i> Greece was moved onto the special, ad hoc Troika scheme, in which a country with a greatly unsustainable debt burden was given more loans but originally no debt relief at all, and great efforts were made to make the country run primary surpluses so that the creditors would not only get all their money back but make a profit. Greatly inadequate debt relief was only added later on when the original plan had collapsed. I&#x27;ll let the former head of the Bundesbank explain why:<p><a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/former-central-bank-head-karl-otto-poehl-bailout-plan-is-all-about-rescuing-banks-and-rich-greeks-a-695245.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/former-central-b...</a><p>Politically this was a wonder solution for the EU core leadership: bail out their banks by stealth, avoiding the anger of their taxpayers by camouflaging it as a rescue mission for the wayward Greeks. Even better, the whole cost of the EU-wide bank bailout could be sweated out of the Greek taxpayer! Well, not really of course: probably no-one ever expected the official creditors to actually get their money back, but hopefully the defaults would be acceptably far in the future for the politicians, who live hand-to-mouth and election to election. Now that the whole thing has exploded, perhaps sooner and harder than they expected, those EU core politicians are trapped by their earlier lies.<p>There is one further wrinkle: not only was the Troika fix-up job vastly harsher on Greece as a creditor than a normal IMF program, it was <i>specifically forbidden</i> by the treaty of Lisbon (the solemn document I was asked to vote on <i>twice</i>, as an Irish citizen) articles 123 <a href=""http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_123</a> and 125 <a href=""http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_125"" rel=""nofollow"">http://euwiki.org/TFEU#Article_125</a> while at the same time the treaty had been crafted to allow Euro member countries continued access to normal IMF programs while remaining inside the Euro. Or at least, everyone thought that it was specifically forbidden, until this prohibition was no longer convenient, and the wizards at the ECJ (the same visionaries who recently discovered the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;) helpfully made it go away.<p>But if we <i>do</i> want to talk about the German example, we don&#x27;t have to go back to the Marshall Plan either. The US Fed&#x27;s cross-border largesse in 2008 would be a good place to start.",1436144749

I really hope that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t actually know anyone who does, and not that people I otherwise respect are secretly doing this.

I&#x27;d bet some people get harassed on Twitter, Reddit, or other widely-used platforms. Some of these people must be identifiable, surely?

E-mails with headers, tweets with screenshots of the full context, IRC messages with Nickserv registration info, etc., so that repeat offenders would have a form of evidence (and I stress evidence) stacked against them? Some form of &quot;witness&quot; system, where other recipients (Twitter users, IRC users, etc.) can sign off that they saw this take place?<p>Basically, create a sort of tech industry predator list. Not everyone on there would be readily identifiable, but maybe some would be. I certainly would check it before hiring anyone, look up GitHub usernames and such, and it might help give people who don&#x27;t experience this a better sense of just how terrible and prevalent this all is.<p>So, good idea, at least in part?

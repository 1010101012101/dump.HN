Firstly, recruiters don't understand their specialism ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=112521"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=112521</a> ). I've lost count of adverts for ""open sauce"" developers and suchlike. Secondly, they brazenly lie about details. If a job is advertised with a salary between x and x*3 then the latter is very theorectical. This type of practice is encouraged because it rises to the top when you trivially aggregate.",1203692370

It would seem that socialist societies have demonstrated that when you focus on inequality, you end up stifling productivity.  Maybe there should be more focus on productivity and advancement rather than inequality, although that's harder to do in the domain of Legos.  When you do this, it's not about control of the raw materials as much as it's about who contributes the greatest value at their link in the chain.",1203692342

Facebook was originally designed for college students. So I wouldn't want to suggest that the app was built around the kind of warped prison-yard junior-high-school culture described in the essay.

121272,comment,121137,121201,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Raw materials are less limited than most people think.  The usual scenario is that as a raw material gets scarcer, the price for it goes up.  With the price higher, firms are incentivized to spend more on technology to reach formerly unreachable raw resources, etc.  This is why we've been running out of oil for about 100 years - the price goes up, technology is deployed, etc.  And if we really did start to run out of oil, then the value of energy would go up creating demand for alternates as the price now pays for greater technological breakthroughs, etc.<p>So, to make a long story short, the idea that resources are a zero-sum game is also incorrect in the sense that the underlying value can be found given enough ingenuity unleashed with the profit motive.<p>So the lego example is in no way a reflection of the real world, and if I could give this blog post a larger up vote, I would.",1203691386

So either stop, talk to your buddies, and fix it so that you can get re-motivated, or check all the code back in unlocked and go find the next challenge. Your subconscious is trying to tell you something; listen to it and address it, because it's almost always right. The answer is not here, but you already knew that, didn't you?",1203690967

121263,comment,121194,121194,0,0,ericb,,,"I may get down-modded for this, but I suggest not releasing it given the scenario you described. I love open source, but most open source contributions are made for joy of creation, pride, fame, sometimes naivete (by assuming you'll get the benefits described) and finally, money. Many projects are created because they're ancillary to some business need--like SUN paying Charles Nutter to work on Jruby. These motives don't really apply to your case, and the benefits you list don't materialize for most projects. It costs you time to open source things properly and limits your options. Rightly or wrongly, some companies will be reluctant to buy you with your code released.<p>Statistically, most open source projects do not gain traction, significant users, free features, or free QA. They sit there on SourceForge, unloved. I wish I had a citation here. Try browsing SourceForge projects. Publicity-wise, consider how many you've heard of. It seems likely you'll get little in return for open sourcing. It's like a dance, and there's a decent chance that Baby will be put in a corner.",1203690629
121262,comment,121175,121175,0,0,edw519,,,"A few of my hard earned lessons:<p>Time spent working does NOT necessarily = amount of work completed.  It's easy to get discouraged when you ""sense"" you're not spending enough time on something.  Two days ago, for example, I came here 827 times (well maybe not that many).  But it was a very productive day!  By the end of the day, I figured something out and the flood gates opened.  That's just how it works for hackers sometimes.  If you don't care anymore, that's one thing.  But being frustrated about time spent is a signal something else is wrong, not your commitment.<p>Some experts think we are either preprogrammed with ""moving toward"" or ""moving away"" internal metaprograms.  OK, whatever.  I'm a very positive optimistic person, so I just assumed I was a ""moving toward"" person.  Wrong!  I am HIGHLY  motivated by that which I do not like, but I never realized it.  If I see something I like, I think, ""that's cool"".  But if I see something I don't like, I think, ""That sucks.  I can do way better than that.""  So I do.  It may be one of the 7 deadly sins, but jealousy is a great motivator for ""moving away"" people.  I'm older than every speaker at Startup Weekend, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and possibly our next president.  But I'm just as smart as any of them, and I haven't got mine yet.  That just pisses me off!  (See, it works, I'm ready to hack right now.)  What about you?  How are you programmed?  What can you do to stoke yourself (or piss yourself off)?<p>""When do you know its time to call it quits?""  Never.  I realize most people will disagree with me.  Walt Disney and Colonel Saunders went to a thousand banks before getting a loan.  How soon would you have given up?  When do you quit trying to teach you child how to walk because it's not going as well as you'd like?  Jerry Seinfield jokes that it took him 20 years to become an overnight success.  I've seen the same thing with many hackers I know.  If you know deep down inside that your project is a winner, you must do whatever it takes to get it to ""walk"".  If you're not sure, then maybe you shouldn't have started it in the first place.  Only you can answer that one.<p>Hate to be like Oprah, but if things aren't going as quickly as you would have liked, maybe you oughta read this:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Secret-Getting-Absolutely-Everything/dp/1589804864/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1203690724&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Secret-Getting-Absolutely-Eve...</a><p>It's amazing what you can make happen if you follow the simple advice of this book.<p>Collect data from everyone.

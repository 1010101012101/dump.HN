Modern economic systems are built on consumerism. Saving large sums of money acts like a vacuum on currency and brings markets to a halt. Flowing money lubricates the economy.<p>That&#x27;s basically the sum total of the most recent economic crisis, money wasn&#x27;t moving, so two presidential administrations through gigantic sums of money at the economy, like spraying it down with WD-40, until it started moving again.<p>> Either the person spends that money on something else or sticks it in their savings account and the bank loans some of it out for someone else to spend.<p>The problem is that in aggregate, if nobody is spending money, it doesn&#x27;t move around at all. If nobody takes out a loan, then that money just sits in the bank. Sitting money means nobody needs to manufacture anything because nobody is buying anything, which means there&#x27;s no reason to employ anybody, so nobody makes money. Because times are bad, they save what they have even more and spending continues to go down.<p>Fairly quickly the economy goes into a death spiral, and while plenty of people may have money, there&#x27;s nothing to spend it on anyway.<p>China is using the same economic trick that&#x27;s been used time and time again, in the U.S., Japan, other places, to kickstart their economy. It&#x27;s dumping money into the economy in huge works projects, mostly construction related, and letting that money slosh around. Japan did it in the 80s, but it&#x27;s no longer working as well as it once did, because pretty much everything they need to build is built, and the population is shrinking so they need even less things.",1443646737

Technically the latter is not a problem, it&#x27;s an instance.  It&#x27;s widely believed that for most problems, most instances are comparatively easy to solve using the &quot;obvious&quot; techniques.<p><pre><code>  > I claim that while it is widely believed

Well, when you have an instance to solve, you don&#x27;t have a choice.  If it&#x27;s an easy instance then it&#x27;s an easy instance.  But if it&#x27;s a hard instance then it&#x27;s a hard instance, and it will take exponential time (using the algorithms we currently have).<p><pre><code>  > So, there are parameters for algorithms

You keep using the word &quot;problem&quot; in different senses.  There aren&#x27;t parameters for algorithms, there are instances of problems, and we don&#x27;t get to choose.<p><pre><code>  >> If we can 3-color then we can perform

So if I give you a specific graph to three colour, is that a practical problem?

I still don&#x27;t understand what you mean by the word &quot;theoretical&quot;.  These are practical problems, instances of which turn up all over the world every day.  Given that we want to solve these instances of these problems, in what sense are the problems &quot;theoretical&quot;?<p><pre><code>  > Optimizing UPS may or may not have much

What do you mean by &quot;solving&quot;, &quot;problem&quot;, and &quot;benefit&quot;?  These are genuine questions - you seem to be using these words in ways I don&#x27;t recognise.<p><pre><code>  >> Can you give me any example of anything

    guy (reduced sentence, etc.)?
  * Does the murderer have any motive?  That article
    implies that robbery was the motive, this could be 
    substantiated by looking at what he took, how much it
    was worth, and whether he&#x27;d have any reason to target
    this guy otherwise.  For example whether he ignored any
    obviously better targets of opportunity to get this 
    specific person.
  * Did the murderer know things about why Glossip 
    allegedly wanted this guy dead that he couldn&#x27;t
    reasonably have known otherwise?
  * This was allegedly murder for hire:  did Glossip give 
    this man any large amounts of money and if he did, was
    there any other explanation?  Has he given out large
    amounts of cash before?
  * Does the murderer have any psychiatric or drug-induced 
    conditions that make him see things that aren&#x27;t there?
  * Are there any provable lies in either person&#x27;s story or 
    any history of lying to investigators in the past?  If 
    so, are the lies better explained by confusion or 
    self-protection?
  * Did Glossip ever know things he shouldn&#x27;t have known 
    about the murder?
</code></pre>
I do not claim to know the truth of any of the above statements, mind you.  It&#x27;s very possible that the answers exonerate Glossip, but the story should be something that can be corroborated and verified.  There are lots of facts implied by the story which can be substantiated (or disproved) with sufficient investigation.  So it shouldn&#x27;t be the case that we just don&#x27;t know--the facts will tell a story if the questions above are carefully investigated.<p>That said, I would think that they really shouldn&#x27;t go for the death penalty if they don&#x27;t have direct evidence, that just seems like too much.  But they could, in theory, have answers to the above that eliminate reasonable doubts about his guilt, or lack thereof.<p>That aside, I am wary of the techie bias of ignoring motives entirely and looking only at physical evidence.  Death Note, of all things, illustrates the difference the best, with Light always taking pains to produce no physical evidence, while L counters this with deep insight into his motives.  We saw a lot of that with Reiser, as I recall.<p>In the end, though, I lack sufficient data to claim to have any reasonable idea about whether Glossip is innocent or guilty.  All I&#x27;m saying here is that it shouldn&#x27;t be the case that it&#x27;s somehow unknowable or unverifiable given enough investigation into the questions posed above.<p>-----<p>EDIT:  Another comment pointed to this:  <a href=""http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/10/10-6244.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/10/10-6244.pdf</a><p>I can see lots of places to corroborate (or disprove) the story -<p>>  Sneed said that he and Glossip went to room 102 to make
sure Van Treese was dead.<p>This could have left physical evidence (or witnesses).<p>> He found an envelope with about $4000.00 cash under the seat.  He came back and swept up the glass.  He put the broken glass in room 102, just inside the door.  He said that Glossip took the envelope from him and divided the money with him.  He also testified that Glossip helped him put a shower curtain over the window, and he helped him cover Van Treese’s body.<p>There may be physical evidence left by this (or not), not to mention the money & envelope (fingerprints?).<p>> D-Anna Wood testified that she and Glossip were awakened at around 4:00 a.m. by Sneed.  She testified that Glossip got out of bed and went to the front door.  When he returned, Glossip told her that it was Sneed reporting that two drunks got into a fight and broke a window.  She testified that Glossip then returned to bed.<p>This seems to say that Sneed is lying, unless D-Anna has some motive for protecting Glossip.  Given that they&#x27;re in bed together, and given the following, it&#x27;s not implausible that she was protecting him.<p>> [Billye Hooper] asked Glossip about the car, and Glossip told her that Mr. Van Treese had left to get supplies for remodeling rooms.<p>This is highly suspicious.<p>> Cliff Everhart, who worked security for Mr. Van Treese in
exchange for a 1% ownership, was already at the motel.  He told Sneed to check all of the rooms.  Sneed indicated that he did so.<p>This is also really suspicious.  He really should&#x27;ve known this guy was dead by then, but it really looks like he&#x27;s avoiding it.  And there are two people poking holes in his story.<p>> Subsequent searches revealed that Sneed possessed approximately $1,700.00 in cash, and that Glossip possessed
approximately $1,200.00.  Glossip claimed this money came from his paycheck and proceeds from the sale of vending machines and his furniture<p>This corroborates Glossip&#x27;s story, though we&#x27;d have to see if there was any merit to Sneed&#x27;s alibi or not.

The point is that there are all these problems such that the algorithms we have are exponential, which makes them infeasible. In that sense we don&#x27;t know how to solve them. Why do you claim we do know how to solve them?<p>I claim we can solve them, because we know the basic algorithm that will solve any particular problem given enough time and space: brute-force search and verify.<p>>What do you mean when you say these are theoretical?<p>There is the theoretical, &quot;This entire class of problems is hard.&quot;, NP problem and there is the, &quot;Provide me with a 3-coloring of this specific graph&quot;, NP problem.<p>I claim that while it is widely believed that we cannot solve the entire class of NP problems, we may be able to solve particular, realized instances of problems from that class.<p>Yes, the algorithms are exponential, but if you choose your parameter space appropriately, you may be able to run an exponential algorithm in a reasonable amount of time and space.<p>So, there are parameters for algorithms that we can compute solutions for, but we are still limited to the amount of physical computational ability that we can control. This puts limits on which particular problems we can solve.<p>>If we can 3-color then we can perform better packing, better scheduling, better layouts for processors, we can break crypto-systems, in what sense are these not practical?<p>Only in the sense that I&#x27;m looking for a <i>specific</i> packing problem. For example, here are the dimensions and locations of UPS&#x27;s fleet. Here are the dimensions, locations, and destinations of the packages. Give me the optimal routes. Practically, you&#x27;d probably want to model and solve failure modes as well to find the most &quot;robust&quot; route.<p>>better packing, better scheduling, better layouts for processors<p>What you are referring to here, I have been referring to as &quot;theoretical&quot;.<p>Optimizing UPS may or may not have much tangible benefit, depending on how close their current solutions are to the optimal.

Today we understand how like other building processes the construction of software is, and we freely use other elements of the metaphor, such as specifications, assembly of components, and scaffolding.<p>The building metaphor has outlived its usefulness. It is time to change again. If, as I believe, the conceptual structures we construct today are too complicated to be specified accurately in advance, and too complex to be built faultlessly, then we must take a radically different approach.
Let us turn nature and study complexity in living things, instead of just the dead works of man. Here we find constructs whose complexities thrill us with awe.

Also, it&#x27;s base 16 :)<p>Anyhow, the source data was most definitely base 2 (as is your computer&#x27;s memory, I assume) and later encoded into base52 to be represented as a string (unless someone at Microsoft wrote it in base52, which seems unlikely).",1443643438

4162200,comment,4161664,4162012,3,0,mping,,,"I strongly disagree with this. I'm consulting for a project where I cannot discuss technical decisions about database modelling; sometimes we need to query 20/30 tables or more in a tx, with very complicated mappings 5+ levels deep. If I was to write the sql for this, I'd take 10x the time and it would be wrong anyway.<p>Of course, this is one end of the spectrum where the ORM just enable me to shoot in the foot faster. I've also worked in the other side of the spectrum where I could use an ORM and generate <i>exactly</i> the sql query I wanted.<p>At the very least, ORMs can save you substantial time because of typesafe queries (if they are typesafe) and expressiveness (specially on join syntax).<p>My teacher used to say that you can solve half of your problems with an abstraction layer; I think for lots of cases an ORM does just this.",1340722791

If nothing else it's going to be an interesting discovery of which Vim features I really use in my daily workflow.<p>Edit: Sadly bumped right into the next issue. It seems in addition to the lack of Vim's visual-block-mode the native multi-select (Ctrl-Shift-L) doesn't work in vintage either. No multi-line editing at all is a bit of a showstopper.<p>Anyway, there's always a next version, I'm not giving up hope. :)",1340722790

Getting broken through will happen because there are so many holes to plug, while strong and slow hashing + salting (while being extremely easy to set up) will make it so it's not even worth it for the attacker to crack passwords when he/she inevitably gets in.<p>Of course we need to plug holes in security and prevent people from getting in (SQL injection vulnerabilities are just as important an offence) but might as well protect the user's information when a breach happens.

4162192,comment,4161664,4161664,20,0,ef4,,,"I think a lot of the frustration with relational databases in general comes from a misunderstanding.<p>People conflate ""relational"" with ""SQL"", because of the historical accident that SQL is the most popular way to query relational data. Then when SQL isn't a good fit for their problem, they think relational is not a good fit for their problem, which is almost certainly not true.<p>The original motivation for relational databases is to have <i>path-independent</i> access to data. This is a really powerful idea.<p>What I think we really need are better APIs around relational data access that embrace real relational semantics, instead of dumping them in favor of an object graph at the first opportunity (which throws away the path-independent access).",1340722723

Most of the time they are not. But let's just concentrate on the ideal workaholic.<p>Workaholics enable last minute heroics disaster management. But if you're doing that, even if you do it successfully, just the fact that you are doing it, means you messed something up. You shouldn't need last minute heroics on your projects.  <i>Well</i> managed projects don't do that.<p>And even more importantly the more long term your project is the more important it is to manage it well and avoid last minute heroics.<p>The long term quality and maintainability of large projects really suffers with such emergency heroics. In fact, each and every one of your death marches over the years could have been a great success. But together they've made all future progress far, far, far slower that it could have been had you not had the need for death marches in the first place.<p><i>Exceptions apply to small projects who only care about reaching a milestone NOW, not about long term TOC.</i><p>On any large and complex project there will be huge pressure to engage in last minute heroics. If you literally do not have that option THAT forces you to manage your project better.<p>But combine that huge ever present pressure with workaholics and you're almost guaranteed to take advantage of a death march.<p>Imagine it is a death march for only one person, the company workaholic. A wonderful person, who is also a technical genius.  That person takes on a complex feature, and implements it over a weekend, pulling at least one all-nighter. Normally that person is 10x more productive than average so in that weekend they make HUGE progress.<p>Now remember the old adage about any developer who is indispensable should be fired immediately? Sounds harsh, but think about it.<p>I pride myself on working hard to never make myself indispensable. Produce maintainable code, far less complex than I am capable of, document, train colleagues, etc. That's the <i>minimum</i> needed for long term health of any large and complex projects.<p>What happens if the ideal workaholic gets hit by a buss right after that weekend death march? Now everyone else will have to come up to speed on their code, and that <i>will take longer</i> than if they had been allowed to write it themselves, over a week or two, with that workaholic's help and guidance.<p>What happens if the workaholic does NOT get hit bu a buss? Great, but again overall development is slowed down. it went a lot faster for that one weekend, but everyone now still has to come up to speed to keep the project going.<p>You rob from the future to save the present and you drop a lot of the money on the floor while doing that.<p>Really, really well managed projects explicitly forbid last minute heroics. That's how you know management knows what it's doing.",1340722695

There is no such map. It turns out to be a general principle that just because something is basically impossible doesn't mean that you can't write code that sort of kind of does it mostly most of the time, but the usually when that happens you end up with an enormous endless tar pit of a mess that even after massive resource expenditure still has lots of quirky problems and doesn't really work. It's better to build your system on foundation that doesn't involve solving an impossible problem.<p>Another example: ""Multitasking"" in Mac OS prior to OSX. No amount of hackery can turn a cooperative multitasking system into a preemptive one... but you sure can make a big mess trying. There's a lot of other examples if you look around. Look for a big, endlessly-growing mass of code that never seems to stabilize no matter how many resources are poured into it, and you'll probably find it's trying to do something impossible deep down in its core.",1340722404

PHP is bad because it has a wide variety of objectively awful design flaws, its standard library is a conflicted mess, and it's unperformant.  Implementing it into a modern architecture is highly correlated with sloppiness and technical debt.<p>ORM is bad because the impedance mismatch between an object and a relational model is very difficult to get right.<p>Frequently, for example, one iterates over collections of objects in the OO paradigm.  A naively written ORM, or one without sufficient introspection into the loop intent, can translate that into N select statements, each incurring a network round trip.<p>The end result is that OO programmers have to understand not only their object code, but also the relational model, and finally too the ORM's peculiarities and suboptimalities.  So in attempting to solve one problem, most of the time you end up with three.<p>That said, there is a sweet spot in ORMs for simple code (e.g. most web apps, where ActiveRecord and Sequel and the like are fine).

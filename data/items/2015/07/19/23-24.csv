With relative font-sizes (em,rem,vh,vw,wmax etc) you could just change the (absolute) font-size of the body tag to resize everything else. Scaling would then be easy to do in with a little JavasSript, a plugin or by just honoring the default body font-size the browser set.<p>The problem is, that using em makes your styles more complex. They are difficult to use, because ems are relative to the parent element for font-size and to the element itself for other attributes. If you define a font-size in em for an element you have to know, where you are going to put this element on the page. Define the font-size for a list, put a list inside a list and you messed up your design. Unfortunately the other relative units are not as well supported, so most websites just use pixels.<p>Many websites use the Bootstrap framework these days and Bootstrap uses pixels, too. Here is a discussion about the topic in their issue tracker:<p><a href=""https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/1943"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/1943</a><p>Ultimately their solution is to drop IE8 support and use rem, which is relative to the body font-size, in version 4. I look forward to that. While people could still mess up the scaling by adding their own absolute font-size declarations, Bootstrap websites will then default to being easily scalable.",1437349932

I have an mba and another professional degree and wanted to do a startup, so in theory, I could have tried to find a tech cofounder, but in the end, felt I would be in a better position if I learnt to code. As usual, paul graham says it better than I can, &quot;anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e.g. building mobile apps) in a year. Since a successful startup will consume at least 3-5 years of your life, a year&#x27;s preparation would be a reasonable investment. Especially if you&#x27;re also looking for a cofounder.&quot;<p>I would advise against the bootcamp (unless it&#x27;s free?), you don&#x27;t need one as long as you have one or two buddies who code, who can advise you on what to learn and help you when you get stuck, the response to your post suggests that you will have a lot of people who would be willing to help! It might be a good idea to put an email in your HN profile, make it easier for folks to get in touch.<p>We started with python (udacity cs101), lisp/scheme using the free &#x27;simply scheme&#x27; book ( <a href=""https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html</a> ) together with learning some of the tools like unix command-line/vim/git, then a course on web programming (udacity cs253), while she was doing college full-time, and I was working full-time.<p>We then started learning rails and working almost full-time on the startup around Oct 2014, and launched v1 of our web app in March 2015. Still working on getting more customers :). Don&#x27;t be in too much of a rush to leave what you do now: I think it&#x27;s definitely a good idea to have a &#x27;day job&#x27; that pays the bills, while you work on little projects that are interesting to you and help you learn the various technologies, you may well find one of them turns into something a lot bigger.<p>We also applied to yc (unsuccessfully), which may have been good for us: I think the value of the advice they can give is high, but I now think it&#x27;s kind of a waste of the opportunity if you&#x27;re not raising money at the end. We are still figuring out &#x27;what users want&#x27;, and in hindsight, raising money would have been both difficult to resist, and a terrible idea for us at that time.<p>Most of the advice yc gives is &#x27;open source&#x27;, for example, paul graham&#x27;s essays and books, jessica livingston&#x27;s book, the yc startup school etc, so you don&#x27;t need to get into yc to learn what they have to say.<p>I now think that the best time to go through yc would be after you&#x27;ve internalized what they teach, have made something users want, are growing, and now need funding so you can grow even faster. I think YC fulfilled a different role in the early days when it was so small, but is now so competitive, it&#x27;s best to think of it a bit like hiring an investment bank when looking to IPO. In theory, they take a chunk of equity in exchange for good capital markets advice that will get you a much better valuation: as far as investment banks go, this is usually self-interested bullshit, but I think would be an accurate description of the value of yc.<p>Best of luck, and get in touch by email, it would be good to chat!",1437349612

Initially, I think I tried to just make `curry` return something that looked like the anonymous function inside of `resolver` – which of course didn&#x27;t work, because I had no way to store all of the previous arguments.<p>Ultimately, I think there are probably a number of good ways to do this, and I would never claim that mine is the &quot;right&quot; one. It&#x27;s really just a representation of the way I think about things, I guess.<p>If you do a bit of digging, there are some other great blog posts about currying, and each one has a different approach. It&#x27;s actually pretty interesting to see how different people have implemented it. For a what basically amounts to a 10-line function, there&#x27;s a pretty amazing amount of diversity in the way people approach it.",1437348829

Naively, that&#x27;s 16 bytes per entry (8 for the number, 8 for the LRN), so 8GB.<p>First optimization is changing the LRNs to a lookup, as there&#x27;s only ~30K uniques. So that cuts the data to 5GB. That&#x27;s OK but it&#x27;d be better if it was smaller and quicker to load.<p>I implemented a delta-encoding system with multi-level indexing, ISAM style. Data&#x27;s compressed on a &quot;page&quot; basis, like 4KB or so of data at a time. That way all data is compressed while in memory and lookups can be done on the compressed data directly. A header on each page provides the range it covers, so you can quickly skip to the next page if the index wasn&#x27;t precise enough.<p>Delta encoding is neat here, because on average, there&#x27;ll only be gap of 18 numbers from one entry to the next (~9B possible numbers / 500M). I used base128 encoding but simple16 or another way (there&#x27;s SIMD-optimized formats) would have been even better.<p>Using this method, the entire dataset only requires about 600-800MB of RAM.",1437348796

9913267,comment,9912939,9913076,0,0,dalke,,,"&quot;Religion&quot; is such a broad term. Both those for and against slavery in the US justified their beliefs from the same religious text.<p>&quot;Influence&quot; is another nebulous term. Some religious faiths in the US considered those with dark skin to have been marked and cursed by God to a life of subjugation. This faith has certainly historically lead to racially biased laws and racially biased justice system. (Eg, slavery in the US, but also institutionalized racism like redlining carried out by the Federal Housing Administration.)<p>The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which raised the penalties on the crack to be much 100x higher than that of non-crack cocaine, strongly disproportionally affected black Americans. Part of the reasoning behind the Act was to help the black communities ravaged by drug use, but a larger part of it was the ratcheting up of the War on Drugs. This War has its roots in racist viewpoints of the early 1900s. Anslinger, one of the early high officials in that &quot;war&quot; is often quoted as saying:<p>> “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz, and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers, and any others … the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races… Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death … Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men. ”Marihuana leads to pacifism and communist brainwashing … You smoke a joint and you’re likely to kill your brother … Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind.”<p>With &quot;Their Satanic music&quot; it&#x27;s not hard to infer that there is a religious influence, though it&#x27;s only one of many influences in that quote.<p>In short, a question of &quot;whether these sentencing laws are influenced by religion&quot; can be easily be answered &quot;yes&quot;.<p>Then again, I could also find people who use religion to argue for reducing the severity of these laws.",1437348432

9913223,comment,9908694,9910155,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Generally the most common measurable is sector reallocation errors. This comes from various random things going wrong at the wrong time and the disk re-allocates a new sector from the spare pool to deal with one that has gone bad. In operation, our disks at Blekko pick up sector reallocation errors at a low statistical rate that picks up prior to total failure. Since our infrastructure is triply redundant (three disks hold a copy of every piece of data) we can simply reformat drives which develop sector errors. If you plot the time between sector errors developing over the life of the drive, it gets shorter rapidly as the drive as nearing complete failure. Sometimes however there is no warning, the drive simply fails. As with my previous experience at Google and NetApp before that, there is a small rise in early failure (infant mortality) then a long tail toward a steep failure rate after about 10 years.",1437347601

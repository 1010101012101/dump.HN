9588683,comment,9584099,9584991,0,0,vamega,,,"Certainly.<p>I think it starts off with your claim that Quasar is easy to integrate with existing Java libraries. I find that claim to be untrue since any library it&#x27;s used with needs to be retrofitted/wrapped to make it work with Quasar. If that isn&#x27;t the case I don&#x27;t understand why Comstat exists.<p>The article makes it seem like Akka cannot be used from Kotlin. I think that&#x27;s disingenuous, given that Akka has a Java API there is absolutely no reason to not be able to use it from Kotlin, or Groovy. I&#x27;m unsure if Quasar can&#x27;t be used from Scala because of the Bytecode manipulation that you&#x27;re doing being incompatible with the Bytecode that the Scala compiler is putting out.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the part about &quot;non-standard DSL&quot; being used to describe the method of composing futures in Akka. Seems weird to call a DSL &quot;non-standard&quot;. I&#x27;m also not seeing a DSL in the accompanying code.<p>Then there are the claims that Quasar being able to run inside a Servlet container is really a huge advantage. No explanation at all is given for that assertion. As far as I&#x27;m aware it was not a goal of the Play framework to be Servlet compatible. It&#x27;s a framework that provides a HTTP server, I don&#x27;t see this as fundamentally different than Node or Go which also do this. Python and Ruby need application servers like uWSGI and Unicorn, I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s a good thing but the article claims that running under a JavaEE Servlet container is a good thing as if it&#x27;s an axiom.<p>I&#x27;m excited about continuations on the JVM. Lightweight threading is something I&#x27;d love to have. I used to work on a Actor based language that compiled to the JVM (a very object-oriented actor language). The lack of lightweight threads was a real issue for that system.<p>However posts come off as unreasonable because of the tone.<p>Disclosure - I&#x27;ve not worked withQuasar or Comstat just yet so I can&#x27;t talk to their technical abilities.",1432306750

This security system is high scalable, and provides complete 3-in-1 functionality:<p>1 – verify server identity<p>2 – verify client identity<p>3 – establish encrypted secure connection<p>The novelty of the proposal is in the complete decentralization of the system, i.e. the lack of a group of servers running under a single authorization (as used in the systems of Kerberos, OpenID, TeddyID and the like).<p>As a result, it is not possible for EMCSSL to suffer system-wide service disruption either due to technical failure or malicious attack upon authorization servers.

9588666,comment,9587388,9587827,0,0,Nursie,,,">> Since you can call target process functions from GDB, it would be interesting to have some form of &quot;emergency dump&quot; function you could call, to get out the data even though the process as a whole has hung.<p>I have seen these before in some server products. Not necessarily printing out <i>everything</i> you needed to know, but to give some important internal stats, etc. Functions not called from anywhere in code that cause the process to output stuff if called from a debugger.<p>>> This would have the benefit by being implemented in the target process itself, so it could of course have full knowledge of the data structures and so on. It could potentially be way better than a raw (manual) memory-level inspection.<p>So it is possible, as I have worked on products that do this, to have a custom debugger that knows <i>everything</i> about the process.<p>You write the program in such a way that you avoid dynamic allocation, almost everything is implemented in predefined global buffers of one sort or another, and then the debugger knows where everything is at compile time. This may seem inflexible and painful to code, but if you are in a highly resource-constrained environment in the first place then it has some advantages.<p>You can then use the debugger to watch and modify absolutely everything, at runtime or from a memory dump. It can be quite powerful.",1432306605

How did you find me - Considering you stated this is in reply to LinkedIn recruiters; LinkedIn?? ...<p>5.

What is to stop you from ignoring them and contacting companies directly once they give this? This is a poor choice and will drive away recruiters. I do see this is not a required field, but that is not obvious at first glance.<p>6. Location - You should consider converting this into a zipcode lookup or something. If not generic information such as state or city may be entered here. ( or possibly nothing/bogus info )<p>7. Job title - Often recruiters have multiple positions available depending on your experience and fit. Also job title doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything. Half of the jobs I have had had no job title.<p>8. Job description - This is usually provided in the email I get from recruiters. That said, sometimes they don&#x27;t so I can see the use.

You should be more interested in the opportunity not the exact pay. This looks like a money grab. Having a good career is more important than a dollar figure.

If I were to design an autonomous car today I would design it with one huge top hinged door on each side and a ramp that makes it easy to drive a wheelchair straight in. Have all the seats facing each other and ensure that at least one folds up/swivels to the side to make room for the wheelchair. This would also benefit people traveling with over-sized luggage.<p>The only thing Uber will get from this is bad PR. Their seeming arrogance (not only in this matter) is a real turn off.",1432304570

I was just correcting your misconception about burglary laws.<p>> A laptop in an unlocked cabinet is not really breaking in.<p>Burglary, again, is gaining entry to a place you&#x27;re not authorized to be, with the intent to commit a criminal act. Whether the cabinet was locked or not has no bearing on that charge. In many places, entering an unlocked car or house that doesn&#x27;t belong to you constitutes burglary, even if you don&#x27;t do anything while you&#x27;re there. It&#x27;s up to the court to prove whether you had intent to commit a crime, but the simple act of gaining unauthorized entry is usually enough to be charged with burglary.<p>One more thing: I agree with you in that I don&#x27;t think Aaron felt what he was doing was wrong. Given my background in law enforcement, I simply felt compelled to correct a misconception.<p>You can read more about the charge of burglary in general here, though you may wish to read about Massachusetts&#x27;s specific laws as well:<p><a href=""http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/burglary-overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/burglary-overvi...</a>",1432303633

She went for a second opinion to MD Anderson in Houston (a few states away) and was told by their team this treatment was ludicrous and they prescribed an entirely different series of treatments. My family member is now just fine, but if they had stayed with the local specialist who knows. But if I get sick I want access to places with the best long term survival rates, not whichever doctor happened to move next door.",1432303215

I couldn&#x27;t afford them until UberX came out. I took an UberX last night and the driver didn&#x27;t know the cross street in Harlem I told him to go to. He insisted on me finding the street address and putting it in the app so that GPS could guide him. Then he asked for five stars before I left. His car had random water bottles in the back seat.<p>But none of that bothered me.<p>I want to get to point B from point A - that 15 minute user experience isn&#x27;t really important to me. So all I care about is cost and, atleast here in NYC, UberX can sometimes be cheaper than a yellow cab.<p>Different strokes for different folks I suppose.",1432303208

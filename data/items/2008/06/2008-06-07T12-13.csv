At first I didn't believe in PG's advice for multiple cofounders, but as time goes by I definitely think it's important now.<p>As a one person shop I can't do much more than consulting, and as a technically minded person I find that I'm not particularly motivated to do the promotion / PR / SEO side of things. I'm on the lookout for a cofounder now but it's hard(er) to pick one up after college and all my friends want stable jobs instead of entrepreneurship.<p>If it's working for you now then I wouldn't worry about it.

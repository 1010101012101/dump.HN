Subject: [Nouveau] offer to help, DCB
To: nouveau@lists.freedesktop.org<p>Hi Nouveau developers,<p>NVIDIA is releasing public documentation on certain aspects of our GPUs,
with the intent to address areas that impact the out-of-the-box usability
of NVIDIA GPUs with Nouveau.  We intend to provide more documentation
over time, and guidance in additional areas as we are able.<p>As a first step towards that, we&#x27;ve posted a document here:<p><pre><code>    ftp://download.nvidia.com/open-gpu-doc/DCB/1/DCB-4.0-Specification.html
</code></pre>
that documents the Device Control Block (&quot;DCB&quot;) layout in the VBIOS.
The DCB describes board topology and the board&#x27;s display connectors.<p>I suspect much of the information in that document is not news for
the Nouveau community, but hopefully it will be helpful to confirm your
understanding or flesh out the implementation of a few unhandled cases.<p>A few of us who work on NVIDIA&#x27;s proprietary Linux GPU driver will pay
attention to nouveau@lists.freedesktop.org and try to chime in when
we can.<p>If there are specific areas of documentation that would most help you, that
feedback would help NVIDIA prioritize our documentation efforts.<p>If you have specific questions for NVIDIA, you can ask here, or direct
them to: open-gpu-doc@nvidia.com.  I can&#x27;t promise we&#x27;ll be able to answer
everything, but we&#x27;ll provide best-effort in areas where we are able.<p>Thanks,
- Andy Ritger",1380048919

That&#x27;s the benefit of the employer-employee relationship and being compensated primarily in wages.<p>So my advice is to ride the bubble because the inflated salaries and other compensation are good for you, but be mindful of what might happen if the bubble pops. If it&#x27;s bad enough, you might be left unemployed with very few job prospects for a period of time. Don&#x27;t inflate your lifestyle, and use the opportunity to build up a large savings account. If the bubble pops, that&#x27;ll tide you over for a long period of unemployment until the job market recovers or give you breathing room where you can pivot your career.<p>If all this talk about bubbles turns out to be just fear-mongering and it doesn&#x27;t pop in the end, it&#x27;s still money in your pocket you can use to bootstrap your own company or eventually retire on.<p>The worst things to do are to spend all the money you have, or invest it in bubbled assets that might evaporate.",1380048568

Tin the wire with your solder. Use a large paperclip or tweezers to prevent heat transfer that might melt the insulation. Locking forceps can work if you bend the handle so that the jaws don&#x27;t crush the wire.<p>Once the wire cools, coat it with a thin layer of flux.  Then cut a length of solder to fit into the connector cup. Insert the tinned wire next to the solder strip and heat the cup. At the exact moment when the strip of solder melts and blends with the tinned wire, rock the wire away from, and then back down against the back of the cup, and remove heat. Hold it still while it cools.<p>Slide the heatshrink over the connector and shrink it with a heat gun.  Don&#x27;t use a lighter - it chars the insulation and you&#x27;ll have to start over.

(one of the advantages, I think, of a high-touch service is that if you are paying me to manage your VPS, well, if it gets compromised, well, first it&#x27;s my job to see to it that it doesn&#x27;t get compromised, but if it does, it becomes my job to clean up the mess, bring up a new host, restore from pre-compromise backups, etc... - you get to be the hero rather than the bad guy.)<p>Key here, I think, is setting expectations;  setting expectations is harder than you think, though.

Editor&#x27;s aren&#x27;t trying to be encyclopedic. They&#x27;re looking for things that are entertaining that will generate page views and respect from peers/advertisers. If you&#x27;re in a &quot;boring&quot; market, focus on your bio or the amazing things your product allowed a user to do.<p>+ Optimize your company/product for press<p>You can do a lot to improve your chances of coverage by the way you develop and position your product.<p>- Look at how Buzzfeed and Upworthy write their headlines and practice pitching your product and its features that way. e.g. Look at a product like &quot;Zombies, Run!&quot; They&#x27;re in a hugely crowded segment of the market, but a unique concept and catchy branding have helped them vault to the top of their part of the app store.<p>- A friend developed a game for cats. It seems silly at first glance, but it&#x27;s catnip to producers/editors/writers. Go after some crazy market segment, or serve them in some crazy way. Uber pulled a fun stunt over the summer where you could summon an ice cream truck and it got huge pickup. Even if your product is pedestrian, there&#x27;s probably a way to optimize it for attention.<p>- Have a compelling design  Visuals are huge. If you&#x27;re making hardware, hire a pro photographer. If you&#x27;re developing apps, have some unique UI features. Writers get a lot of pitches and having good art is a great way to grab attention.<p>+ Press coverage does NOT equal &quot;worthiness&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t feel bad if you&#x27;re not resonating with the tech media. I&#x27;ve pitched stories about startups that have $100MM+ revenue run rates and millions of users that get rejected instantly.

Contrast that with Foursquare who as of a year ago has ~$2MM and revenue and no shortage of ink.<p>+ Focus on your market<p>Every startup wants the row of impressive logos on its homepage, but you&#x27;ll often get better qualified leads by focusing on more niche publications in your market.

I don&#x27;t know about the entire series of thinkpads. The lid closes and opens smoothly, no latching mechanism -- and stays in the position you leave it in. It&#x27;s just as smooth if not smoother than my old 2009 MBP.<p>On the subject of the stigma with &#x27;plastic&#x27; cases -- we are not talking about cheap plastic here. The bottom of the laptop is metal of some kind. Same with the edges. The top of the lid is some sort of rubberized metal. The palm rests/speaker area is the only plastic I can find, and it has a similar texture and &quot;solid feel&quot; to the stuff I find on my prosumer DSLR -- something also designed to be rugged.",1380047493

It would kinda suck if you&#x27;re timings were all out by a bit because you kept you&#x27;re finger on there slightly too long.<p>This is actually an example of breaking a convention to improve usability [1]. It&#x27;s also an example of how if you&#x27;re looking hard enough you&#x27;ll find inconsistencies and things that are theoretically horrific in stuff you&#x27;ve been using absolutely fine for years.<p>The real inconsistency on this screen is that the Reset button doesn&#x27;t activate on release. If ever there was a time you want to be able to back out of an action by moving your finger away from the button before release I&#x27;d say this is it.<p>While the faux naivity is a bit irritating, it does make a valid point (if not entirely novel). The more you pare back your UI the more you lose distinction between interactive and non-interactive elements. If your buttons are simply color tinted text, it&#x27;s difficult to unambiguously use color tinting to highlight text of note such as the current day.<p>What makes iOS 7 really interesting is how it tries to counter that. For example, color hinted text in the edges of the screen will always be actions, so color is enough; color hinted text in the middle of the screen could just be marking interesting things, so actions are usually accompanied by thin borders.<p>An proper dive into the design and the trade-offs rather than endless &quot;look at this edge-case&quot; would be really interesting.<p>[1] Caveat because I&#x27;m sure otherwise someone will try and pull me up on it.

Discussions and arguments are welcome. Name-calling will be ignored. Trolls will not be fed.<p>----------<p>> Downplaying the timestamp attempts to make the content appear more evergreen.<p>This is dangerous.<p>Imagine a newbie developer landing on one of your old posts looking for directions on something. Unfortunately for her, there isn&#x27;t any other relevant material available anywhere else on the web. Also, whatever you wrote in that post was was relevant only for a few weeks after it was written. Can you imagine the anguish you&#x27;d be putting them through because they tried to follow your directions and failed miserably?<p>Before you claim it to be an edge-case, I&#x27;ve fallen prey to the same situation many times in my search for such elusive knowledge.<p>Personally, this is one of the reason I HATE the non-availability of time-stamps, especially on tech blogs. What the hell are you trying to say? That your code is perfect and won&#x27;t need to change ever? You aren&#x27;t fooling me, rather, you are fooling yourself.<p>> RSS is dying.<p>RSS isn&#x27;t dying, sorry.<p>Tracking google search trends isn&#x27;t a good way to measure how popular RSS - or anything, for that matter - is. A simple explanation could be that because more people know about RSS today than a few years ago, searching for it is no longer necessary. Almost everyone knows about Hurricane Katrina, but they don&#x27;t search for it everyday, do they?<p>The consumption of RSS has changed, though.<p>Until a few years ago, feeds used to be the ONLY way to consume RSS. Then mashups happened. Then APIs became ubiquitous. PubSubHubbub, JSON & JSONP have flourished in recent times. All of these were &#x27;derived&#x27; (in a broad sense) from RSS.<p>Oh, and before you point to Google Reader, allow me to make an anticipatory point. Google shut down Reader because they didn&#x27;t find it worth the effort to monetize - it had nothing to do with the consumption of RSS. Even till the very last day, there were people clamoring for Google to continue or hunting for a suitable GReader replacement. In what way does that strike you as the &#x27;death&#x27; of RSS?<p>Almost every site out there, that updates regularly maintains a feed. Except Twitter, of course. But then, Twitter implementing an RSS feed isn&#x27;t adding much anyway. Their existing consumption patterns and the ecosystem around them is robust enough to do without RSS and Atom feeds.<p>If anything, I agree that RSS is very unidirectional, but that&#x27;s where I believe PubSubHubbub can make a difference. In fact, if I may be so bold, I&#x27;d say that RSS is evolving and PubSubHubbub is one of its evolutionary intermediates.<p>With the insane number of consumption platforms and our burning desire to instantly know everything, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if, sooner or later, someone finds a new way to consume RSS & Atom feeds.<p>I have already begun this process for myself by building @updt_me - I now consume all my RSS & Atom feeds through Twitter. Yeah, that was a plug but hey, it also happens to be extremely relevant.",1380046889

The unethical way.<p>I decided to use a startup to raise some money for a non-profit. Their business model was to help fund events / organizations with their platforms, and take a fixed 2-3% commission on the funds raised. I raised $500 using the platform. But I never received the check for the $500.<p>I knew the founder personally. I e-mailed him and week after week he said, &quot;the check is coming, there has been some sort of accounting error&quot;. 2 months passed, and no check. Then 3 months.<p>So, I e-mailed one of his investors, a mutual friend. He said, &quot;Oh no, I think they are in a very bad place and may not have any money. I have stopped using the service.&quot; I e-mailed the founder again. He replied that my money was gone, but that he had committed himself to pay it back.<p>He was looking for work, though, so he wasn&#x27;t sure when. Then, the platform&#x27;s domain name quietly stopped responding to web requests, and the whole platform went offline.<p>I&#x27;m now in this weird position where I&#x27;m debating pursuing legal action. I&#x27;m still in touch with the founder. He keeps saying that he will pay soon, but doesn&#x27;t.<p>The money actually came from over 20 people who had donated to the cause. They are unaware the money never made it to the non-profit. The check I was trying to receive was meant to just be a direct donation to this cause. The founder&#x27;s mismanagement actually led to $20-$40 being &quot;stolen&quot; from about 20 people. In a way, I acted as a middleman, by encouraging people to donate via this platform. And now, I feel very responsible to get this money back. Do I pursue legal action? I&#x27;ve debated it.<p>So, here&#x27;s another piece of advice about how startups should die: &quot;if it&#x27;s not your money, it&#x27;s not your money&quot;. In other words, if your platform deals with money (e.g. accepts donations, facilitates payments) it is <i>NOT</i> OK to use money you owe your customers to fund operations. That is called <i>theft</i>, plain and simple!",1380046255

I&#x27;ve personally sunk months of my life in getting a variety of custom window frames to work &quot;well enough&quot; on various Windows flavors (for Chrome on XP, Vista, 7 and newer). I think part of the benefit of these new mobile platforms is their simplicity - there is less going on outside the app&#x27;s control at any given point in time, so there&#x27;s less to worry about.<p>(On Windows, there are several ways to achieve a &quot;custom-ish&quot; frame, but only if you really study the window manager-app interaction and think about the problem as if you were the window manager can you come close to doing a proper job of it... handling the right messages (some of which are undocumented and only discovered via using spy tools), responding in the correct way etc.)",1380045993

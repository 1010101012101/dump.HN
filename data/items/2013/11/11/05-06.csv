And this was possible because their core teams are not using XNA. In other words, strategic support.<p>Maybe not yet on other fields, but I feel the time is close. The proof is, of course, the TypeScript. If you haven&#x27;t checked it, google it right now. MS decided to make a new language instead of porting CLR on Javascript. I am sure that stuff is post .NET/C# (I mean post buzzword) of MS. If you don&#x27;t believe MS will abandon .NET, think about how MS themselves will be damaged if .NET abandoned. Virtually none. None of their product core is <i>based</i> on .NET. Anyway even after they abandon .NET, it will keep taking  periodic update like they did on ActiveX for last decades.",1384149131

U.S. security sources revealed in 2010 that the organization had been working out how best to blow up oil tankers. Though why bother with intercontinental missiles or explosives, the urban planning academic Stephen Cohen writes, when you can just ship everything you need in parts and assemble it at the required destination? &quot;Containers...are the poor man&#x27;s missiles: you no longer have to be a big powerful government to create catastrophe.&quot; In 2003, ABC News shipped depleted uranium from Jakarta to Los Angeles in an attempt to expose the weaknesses in port barriers. The stunt didn&#x27;t go down well at the Department of Homeland Security, whose declared mission is to &quot;stop dangerous things and dangerous people from entering the country,&quot; even if those dangerous things are sent by people from a national news channel. In fact, shipping uranium is legal, as long as you declare it. ABC didn&#x27;t, and no one checked.</i><p><i>Connecting the sea to terrorism has become popular in security studies. Al Qaida certainly understands ships: not only because it rammed the USS Cole with a boat, but because it is thought to own or charter a small fleet. North Korea has its own flag, a fleet of 242 vessels, and the ability to make maritime mischief. Lloyd&#x27;s List reported in 2012 that 120 vessels had reported GPS malfunctions in seas near North Korea, in an article that suspected the work of a North Korean signals jammer.</i><p><i>A senior government official was asked in 2002 about the threat of maritime terrorism. &quot;This industry is a shadowy underworld,&quot; he said. &quot;After 9/11 we suddenly realized how little we understood about commercial shipping.&quot; In 2010, Nigerian security forces discovered 240 tons of rockets, mortar shells, and small arms ammunition in 13 containers that had been shipped on the German-owned, French-operated, Marshall Islandsflagged Everest from Bandar Abbas in Iran, despite U.N. sanctions that prohibit Iran from selling arms. The contraband was hidden behind marble slabs and fiberglass. The manifest showed that the recipient was &quot;to order.&quot; In short, according to a report, &quot;the ship&#x27;s owners, operators, and officers had no knowledge or reason for suspicion regarding the container.&quot;</i><p>So... the potential for using containerized freight for terrorism is... what?",1384148805

To be honest, I&#x27;ve never quite understood the reasoning behind the charges made against the company brought by the DOJ or by the company&#x27;s detractors.<p>There was a surge of hate for Microsoft back then that was frequently expressed in forums on the fledging web and in the newsgroups. Very often you&#x27;d see complaints about Microsoft being a monopoly, followed by (in the same post), a pitch for Linux or Mac or every once in a while some other system. Linux is better than Windows, and it&#x27;s free! This left me scratching my head. So there&#x27;s a superior, less expensive alternative to Windowswhat&#x27;s your definition of monopoly again? And what of OS/2? Runs Windows apps better than Windows, says IBM, a not so small competitor. (For the youngsters, IBM was a large computing corporation of the time, once the very symbol of market dominance.)<p>The judgment the DOJ eventually won forced Microsoft to untangle IE from Windows. While there&#x27;s no doubt IE had a huge advantage by piggybacking on every copy of Windows, I say so what.

The company I worked for decided that remote work would be the way of the future and it&#x27;d save a ton of costs, so we did a trial where a portion of the workforce would work from home each week until everyone went remote at the end of the year.<p>I don&#x27;t really have a favorite story: remote working is not that interesting. It did have a profound affect on my life, though: since I didn&#x27;t need to work at a specific office, I decided that I wanted to move across the country. Rather than a job opportunity deciding where I lived, I got to spend a few months weighing the pros and cons of various places based on other factors. After 6 months, I moved 3,000 miles away and it was one of the best decisions of my life.<p>Of course, I probably couldn&#x27;t have done that if I had any outside, major, long-term commitments (spouse, children, family I had to stay within driving distance of, a house, etc.).<p>If you&#x27;re in a similar situation, the first bit of advice I can give is that you&#x27;re going to find that &quot;nine-to-five&quot; eventually becomes &quot;whenever I feel like working, as long as I get things done and stay in communication with the rest of the team&quot;. This means working nights or weekends, but it also means being able to knock off and do something fun in the middle of the day. It&#x27;s easy to slip into a situation where you&#x27;re working 9pm-5am or working Thursday-Tuesday one week and then a completely different schedule the next, even if you have a personal schedule (it&#x27;s easy to ignore it).<p>If you need a routine to be productive, you need to create one for yourself, and I would suggest doing it immediatelydon&#x27;t wait until you&#x27;re all over the place in terms of time. If you already have outside commitments (like making sure kids get to school on time or having to walk a dog) you&#x27;ll have a leg up, but otherwise I&#x27;d suggest joining user groups or community sports or something that has set schedules you have to keep.<p>The second bit of advice I can give is to use a phone/video chat as much as possible. It&#x27;s very easy to slip into emailing/texting/IMing/ticketing all the time, but so much is lost in the written word and you can find yourself implying things you didn&#x27;t mean to imply or inferring the wrong things from people&#x27;s messages. I&#x27;ve found you can diffuse most sticky situations with a simple call: when in doubt, don&#x27;t keep emailing, don&#x27;t stew, call the person. Even a run-of-the-mill problem that might take a half dozen emails back-and-forth can usually be resolved with a simple 5 minute phone call.",1384147620

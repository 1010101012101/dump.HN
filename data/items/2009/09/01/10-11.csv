797753,comment,796934,797511,0,0,cabalamat,,,"No such explanation is needed; in the lack of powerful motivating forces for education (or anything else) to be good, it will be mediocre. PG makes the point that school is bad, not because it was deliberately designed to be, but because the design spec was to warehouse otherwise potentially disruptive young people, not particularly to educate them: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a><p>""""""And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this fake world. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In fact their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. And I have no problem with this: in a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose.""""""",1251802367

797746,comment,795712,795749,0,0,redthehat,,,"Thanks for the comment, I assume that by not using proper English, you may be referring to a few typos on site. I may have never got the best grades in English when I was in high school, however, as the site is still going through a lot of improvements, believe me, the spelling errors will be worked on.<p>I (the owner) do speak fluent English, it is my native tongue, so I do apologize if, for some reason, through the cultural boundaries that we may have, if the native English language that I have spoken since birth, differs from your idea of 'the English language'. I may very well look at an additional plug in with the new script that we will be migrating to within the next few months, that allows many other languages, including other adaptations of the English language, including 'Bad Spelling English', 'Deep South English', 'Tasmanian English', and even 'Pirate English'. I hope that this plug in will eliminate any offense that others may have with my bad use of the English language, and will (as you put it), do the world a massive favor. In the meantime, I will have somebody look over my apparent bad use of the english language, which out of 20k views, 100+ members, and many uploads, I have only ever had one complaint.What a shame it was about my use of the English vocabulary.I will endeavour to make sure that the english used on site, is as easy as possible for all who speak this fine language to understand, regardless of where you are from, or what your idea of the English language is.<p>By Adds, we mean that we advertise on the site. (another typo, I apologize). A lot of people dislike advertising on sites, especially those in the crowd who have been testing this site for a month in beta, and approaching two weeks completed.<p>Thanks for checking out the site though, its much appreciated, I am extremely apologetic about my 'bad' use of the English language, and am also glad that you support my policy against Cyber Bullying. Because lets face it, cyber bullying is like OMG, rlly ttly like OMGZLOLZ! INORITE, its like totally so wrng, I totally kwym! So wrng to pwn ppl with cyber pics. :p",1251801916

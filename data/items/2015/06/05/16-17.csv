It has a clean syntax with some handy/fancy features but keeps a simple static typing system that makes me feel comfortable.<p>Also, nice to read a review of Rust that didn&#x27;t reduce to “C is the worst evar!” or “Haskell makes no sense!”. Reasoned and clearcut. I certainly disagree with various parts of the review, but I don&#x27;t do any dev for webservices so it is unsurprising that the author and I have a differing of opinion.",1433523588

The deserialization cost of protocol buffers is too high if you&#x27;re doing complex data throughput, and even though the data size is smaller, it&#x27;s better to send larger gzipped JSON (which will be decompressed in native code) and deserialized into JS (also via native code).

Responsible for their own grades, responsible for day to day life, responsible for projects and outcomes. Being able to handle your life, handle deadlines, not think you can boil the ocean - is very important for me as a manager.

The adult population of Haiti is roughly 6 million, so we&#x27;re talking about almost $100 per adult Haitian. Roughly, it&#x27;s about 1/8 of the per capita GDP of Haiti.\nImagine what you could if you were a poor American and received 1/8 of the American per capita GDP after a disaster (~6000 USD). That&#x27;s a new roof, or a replacement vehicle, etc.\nIt&#x27;s not life changing, but it would have been very significant, and massive in scale.&quot;<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9666390"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9666390</a><p>and the article supports his point, saying that &quot;A 2013 study in Uganda found that people who received cash enjoyed a 49 percent earnings boost after two years, and a 41 percent increase after four years, compared to people who hadn&#x27;t gotten a transfer. Another study in Sri Lanka found rates of return averaging 80 percent after five years. In Uganda, not only were the cash recipients better off, but their number of hours worked and labor productivity actually increased.&quot;<p>But for smaller amounts (like the U$ 100 proposed), &quot;One program gave $200 to at-risk Liberian men who were either homeless or who made their income from dealing drugs or stealing. The lead researcher, Chris Blattman, summarized the findings in an op-ed in The New York Times:<p>&quot;Almost no men wasted [the money]. In the months after they got the cash, most dressed, ate and lived better. Unlike the Ugandans, however, whose new businesses kept growing, the Liberian men were back where they started a year later. Two hundred dollars was not enough to turn them into businessmen. But it brought them a better life for a while, which is the fundamental goal of any welfare program. We also tested a counseling program to reduce crime and violence. It worked a little on its own, but had the largest impact when combined with cash.&quot;&quot;",1433522751

By the media!<p>The media is making money by reporting on &quot;things that could kill you&quot;. It&#x27;s getting more efficient at that over time, so if you do watch the news - and I implore you not to - you will start to believe the world is a bad place. That is because you will never, ever hear anything positive in the news. Because it won&#x27;t sell.<p>For every crime in this world, there are ten million selfless acts of love. If the news reported on both equally, it&#x27;d be very boring. You&#x27;d constantly hear about somebody helping another, or putting somebody else before themselves, and you would never even get to the crimes. Not enough time.<p>For every murder in this world, there&#x27;s a friend risking his own life for another. Or 10. We won&#x27;t know. For every war, there&#x27;s a million times more peace.<p>Look at the facts, people. Is it so hard to understand? Is propaganda, dull, dumb, and effective as it is really so hard to get around? Open your eyes, and turn off your TV, newspapers, and the associated websites.<p>There are three reasons why watching news is a huge waste of your time. \n1 - negative bias to an extreme that is hard to imagine, as described \n2 - non-actionable items. Each time you consume news in any form, ask yourself: What can I do about it? What do I have to do about it? Why did I need to know this? Am I just rubbernecking here (hint: YES, you are!)?\n3 - Propaganda and lies. I used to read my local paper front to back every day. And there were a handful of reported-on news where I was an eye-witness. A demonstration, an accident involving me. And even for these harmless items, the news was just plain wrong. THIS WAS NOT WHAT HAD HAPPENED. But it was in the paper. Facts had been altered. Not even maliciously, just to make better story, or because the journalist on the ground couldn&#x27;t see everything, or whatever. Now if the stories I had direct first hand knowledge of where wrong - how about all the others I knew nothing about? How accurate is that going to be? It&#x27;s not.<p>And war propaganda.

None of that happened.&quot;<p>&quot;They never had a real plan for what they wanted to do in housing,&quot; Malany says.&quot;<p>&quot;McGovern wrote an email to her senior staff in November 2013 saying that a particular housing project was &quot;going bust.&quot;&quot;<p>&quot;Now the U.S. government is holding the money and is currently trying to find a different charity to run this 4-year-old housing project, which has yet to produce a single home.&quot;<p>&quot;But if you go in search of those tens of thousands of new permanent homes in Haiti, you won&#x27;t find them.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but the general vibe I got from the article is that Red Cross has not provided the housing they said they provided.

One criticism I have here is that there is a lack of comprehensive data analytics from their actual portfolios before they cut the chord, and that it relies on self reported data from the founders, which is bound to be bias to some degree. Some of these failed that are exact clones of companies that were the exact same idea but implemented more quickly and ended up and still are very successful, and in those particular ideas, the autopsy of the failed companies never seems to want to admit their idea was just not that original, or not implemented as well.<p>Examples that stand out to me just from knowing really successful competitors of the same idea:<p>Bombfell\nManilla\nDnnr\nbloom.fm\nsolorix<p>Overall, I value their feedback (and I am glad to see it compiled as opposed to every failed company posting on here as if they have some diamond in the ruff wisdom on why they failed) but I would prefer some more data based trends.<p>Overall interesting idea to start pulling more calibrated analytics from. I was also thinking someone should do the same thing for lessons learned from how VCs and Angel Investors screw over companies.<p>It&#x27;s actually going to take some time for me to find something on this list that doesn&#x27;t reek of knocking off popularized trending app ideas.<p>I happened to see 99 Dresses on this list, whom I saw on Shark Tank somehow (the one time I watched the show). I&#x27;m a girl and for me personally I don&#x27;t really give about the idea of weddings and think its nonsense, and think it&#x27;s a waste of money, but I thought it was a pretty cool idea that basically you could rent a wedding dress, and that sounded unique to me and a good niche of rent the runway, though I doubt I&#x27;ll ever invest in a wedding dress myself in any capacity. Point is weddings are a billion dollar a yr industry and wedding dresses are sometimes the most expensive part aside from venue and catering. As culture becomes less traditional, it&#x27;s less likely women will view their dresses as a long term investment their posterity will wear.<p>Additionally, I think I know of plenty of girls who would rather rent a designer wedding dress they could never afford outright (especially if their posterity is not going to wear it as culture is these days) than settle for something they like alot less because that is all they could afford to buy, that will sit in a closet. Additionally, now that we have facebook and social media, girls do not need to buy the dress (despite posterity) so it can collect dust in their closet for the sake of nostalgia. Now we have social media to document not only the dress but how the woman looked in the dress. Therefore, providing the capability to rent one of the most expensive clothing items the average woman will ever invest in, seemed like a pretty solid idea, and at least there was something a little unique about it. However, I have no idea how well she implemented the idea nor did I follow the company after the pitch.<p>Other than that one company, I didn&#x27;t see anything I have not heard of realistically, atleast 5 times before.",1433522300

Software that they need that only runs on Windows or OS X<p>2. Syncing to devices like iPods or iPhones<p>3. Lack of easily accessible support infrastructure for when things go wrong, major version upgrades, etc. You can generally take a Windows machine to Best Buy or some other local computer store, or a Mac to an Apple Store, and they can deal with it, but there&#x27;s little accessible support for the complicated cases on Linux unless you have a friend or relative who&#x27;s into Linux.<p>4. Lack of support by IT departments.<p>So if you have a situation like in the original story, where someone is willing to provide that support voluntarily, and you just need a home computer with internet access and no specialized software, a modern Linux desktop will do just fine.<p>> My guess is that GNOME 3 and Unity require roughly as much CPU power and RAM as Windows 7.<p>Lightweight desktops like LXDE and XFCE can run fine on older hardware, and are much lighter weight than Windows 7. If you read the article, you would see that it was running LXDE, not Gnome or Unity.",1433521762

They promise crap, they create division and tension along racial, economic, and any other line they can find.  It&#x27;s a playbook right out of the best South American dictatorships.  The masses vote for them based on stupid shit like &quot;Hope and Change&quot; and then they get nothing.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t understand why these people keep voting for them.  Look at what&#x27;s happening to the black community under a black president.  If there was ever an indication that Democrat&#x27;s mode of operation is to use the masses for votes there you have it, playing live right in front of on us TV nearly every day.<p>The only good thing about Democrats are some of the approaches to social issues.  Things like gays are not evil and the war on drugs is stupid.<p>Republicans?  Crap. The religious right represents delusion and insanity.  They too, when you produce a few key words, will vote for you at the push of a button.  They manipulate a different set of audiences for different reasons.<p>The only good thing about Republicans is the leaning towards fiscal responsibility, low taxes and low spending.<p>A good moderate Libertarian will be for small government, low taxes, a moderate liberal social stance, fiscal responsibility, not fucking with the world with armament and getting the hell out of our lives, homes, businesses and bedrooms.<p>I for one am glad to see someone like Rand Paul making the moves he is making.  He is smart.  He knows that in this country it is still impossible to win as a Libertarian due to the dominance the main parties are granted by the electoral college system.  So, he sits as a Republican.  Yet, it is obvious he is not a bible thumping Republican.  He is a Libertarian, there&#x27;s no doubt about that.  The chances of him getting the nomination are probably not good, but you never know.<p>If voters just stopped to think for a moment to realize that the average politician is not much more than a bad used car salesman working hard to use and abuse them every day for their own gains we might just have a chance to start doing things differently.  That&#x27;s a tall order.  How do you convince a bible thumper to vote for someone that isn&#x27;t going to push their buttons and won&#x27;t demonize gays or other groups?  How do you convince a union leader to have their membership vote for someone who isn&#x27;t going to promise free goodies and favors to their membership?<p>Probably won&#x27;t happen.

Those of us in the middle who see things for what they are and really want to do the right thing for the country and future generations have no voice in this because the big parties and the electoral college system push us down into the noise.  Voting Libertarian in California or Texas is wasting your vote.<p>The electoral college, for all it&#x27;s virtues, has created a system where the party that should be in power right now has no chance at having a voice.  Collectively Libertarians are in the many millions across the nation.  However, our system of government is designed to pretend that every state is a homogeneous voting block, allocating all votes to one or the other party, which is utterly ridiculous in today&#x27;s reality.<p>While I really wish for a Libertarian shift in our politics I fear this is almost impossible to achieve given the realities of how the game is designed and played.",1433520715

I think to myself, don&#x27;t they realize that it&#x27;s pointless, that the year of the Linux desktop will never come, that Linux will always be the distant third-place desktop OS?<p>More constructively, I wonder if recent Linux distros and desktop environments actually run better on 10-year-old hardware than Windows 7. My guess is that GNOME 3 and Unity require roughly as much CPU power and RAM as Windows 7. If that&#x27;s the case, then maybe kids like the one in this story would be better served by a donated Windows 7 system builder license to go with that old hardware.

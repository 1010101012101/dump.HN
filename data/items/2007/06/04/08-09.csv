I know it sounds like a copout, but really, I'd be in trouble if I mentioned it now.<p>Upper mgmt is making us rewrite it in java. (shoot self). It has more to do with what they are comfortable with long term and what the company runs and has the know-how to support.<p>If I had to do it over again, I'd look at Python more carefully. Django was barely out when we started so we were  a bit leery of it. In addition, I didn't have a great impression of Python from doing some toy programs in it. I really liked Ruby's elegance. <p>Overall, I don't think we would've chosen Java above what we have, warts and all. Java is too verbose and RoR let us be extremely flexible and fast when it mattered. <p>Outside of upper management intervention, we'd probably have continued down the ruby path and gambled on the fact that things would be fixed/better in a few years. <p>I feel for twitter, but they're really doing a service for the rest of the RoR community by being the pioneer for extreme scaling issues.",1180946825

Computer ressources are probably not the limiting factor.<p>I'm sure that a lot of researchers in academia have pet theories about how to make it happen, but they need grants. The NSF has funded enough failed AI projects, it's hard for them to justify funding more given the current lack of money in science.<p>There are probably a lot of people working on AGI on their own, or in startups. I am. But you won't hear much about people like me unless we succeed to some level.<p>IMO, the field is waiting for its Einstein to come up.",1180944605

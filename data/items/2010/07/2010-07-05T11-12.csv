I don't disagree with you, but it's a pretty easy mentality for us in the west to adopt.<p>The author is in India, where a very significant portion of the population sleeps on the street and even the ones a notch above them live in abject poverty compared to even our lowest classes[1].<p>I suspect ""being rich"" for an Indian means something quite different than for us, and might very well mean a middle-class existence in our terms.<p>[1] GDP per capita in India is $1,124 a year.",1278331139

That's why I still maintain that regular, dedicated hosting is unbeatable both for high storage and high bandwidth solutions.

By contrast, the two most successful African Empires I'm aware of were much more decentralized - Cartage and Mali.<p>> Longer term there may be a solution to some of this as we find (finally) a successor to democracy that improves on what we've got, but a democratic world government would be an improvement over the silly nation states that we have today (which, even in their most advanced forms are a holdover from a time when there were more kinds of people).<p>This I agree with entirely, yes.<p>> Corporate domination of politics is one of the hardest things that we need to take care of, this planet is not here for corporations, it is here for all of us, including other species.<p>Here's an interesting thought experiment for you - try replacing ""corporations"" with ""organizations"" in any corporate-bashing you read for the next week: You'll find all the statements pretty much hold true. Voting blocs, political parties, religious organizations, even nonprofits often do as much to corruptly impose their agenda on other people as for-profit corporations do.<p>I agree with you that organizations, coalitions, and other blocs of people shouldn't be able to trample individual's rights - but I think power should be primarily start at the level of individual people, and be reserved to them first and gradually upwards. So authority on decisionmaking goes first to individuals, then to communities, then to towns and city districts, then to large cities, then to states, then and only then to countries - from small to large. Large shouldn't be able to impose on small, whether it be Whole Foods Corporation, or the New York Yankees, or PETA, or the Conservative Party in England, or the Democrats in the USA, or labor unions, or General Motors, or anything. Individuals are the way.<p>> His taxation scheme would be a very large step in the right direction.<p>I like some of the ecological merits of it and I agree that taxing productive work is a stupidly bad idea. I bet there'd be some really nasty unanticipated secondary effects with that idea, though. Still would be an improvement over taxing people for doing productive work, which is just crazy on almost all levels.",1278330918

If you want others to keep their promises to you, you should keep your promise to others. Likewise, if you want others to fulfill the contracts they agreed to, you should fulfill the contracts you agreed to.<p>The author offered a contract: ""Pay 4 dollars and promise not to copy and redistribute the media, and I promise to give you a copy"".

So the notion of the motivation behind works is important to understand. Also I typically give myself a B- to a C+ for what I do. I'm not always great at it.<p>Faith without works is dead. Works without faith is just work. Faith and works is a living faith supported by a living God. If you have faith but do nothing in response then you should work that out. If you have no faith and works Jesus says that you already got your reward and you're all set. He has nothing to give you. I pretty much summed up the book of James in the Bible.<p>As for the afterlife everyone who follows Jesus gets a pretty awesome deal and while there is some hinting at a bonus for doing well it's not really that interesting because level 1 heaven is pretty awesome.

But you can get a credit card quite easily, and you will definitely get one if you have regular income.<p>I got my first credit card when I was maybe 20 or 21. The reason was that I was going to a vacation abroad and didn't want to carry loads of cash with me. I just walked into my bank and asked for one; as soon as I told them I was permanently employed and had regular income, it was no big deal. It didn't matter I had only started at this job a few months earlier and I had no existing credit record whatsoever (no loans, no credit cards, no other credit). I didn't have to proove it, just tell them my income and some other facts and sign below.<p>If I had been a Swedish citizen living in Finland, I think it wouldn't have been no different.

In fact, such a proposition is unproveable, as is the claim that ""miracles do happen"".</i><p>Thing is, anything can happen ... it's just a matter of probability. Think of any impossible event (like an angel, i.e. a shiny humanoid with wings, integrating in front of your eyes) and that's possible. It's just highly unlikely.<p>In that light I consider miracles to be very unlikely events. Life on earth is such an event, especially since we haven't found proof that life exists on other planets yet, although we have found the proper conditions (like water).<p>And if life exists on such a planet, did it manage to evolve like us? This is even more unlikely since we may not have the means to observe bacteria from a distance, but we could observe artificial lights and non-random radio signals coming from other planets.<p>And then ... if we manage to build interstellar ships and expand to other planets, that will be prof in itself that no other intelligent beings managed to do that ... simply because aliens had a lot of time to expand to earth before we appeared (after all, if you have enough room to expand, the growth rate is exponential).<p>You can say that life happened by chance, but currently intuition suggests otherwise.<p>Not only that ... but the miracles you witness everyday stop being miracles.

Lately however people have started to use the word to mean any strongly held opinion regardless of any evidence or reason.<p>To believe something is ""to be convinced of the truthfulness of it"", to have faith is to have hope in the future based on a belief.<p>Believe and faith can be misplaced: To be convinced that something is true does not make it true. A conviction which is specific enough maybe testable, a conviction can sometimes be proven or disproven. It is rational to hold convictions which are consistent with available evidence and experiences.<p>A theology is a (philosophical) theory about gods. A theology may be specific enough to be testable, most however are not. Someone who is convinced that a particular theology is true has a religious conviction or religious believe, which often becomes part of the persons identity or self-identification.<p>People who share similar theological convictions often join together to form religious groups and religious organizations. One can be convinced either by personally examining the evidence available or by the believing the word of someone who one considers an authority (often as part of the religious organization one is a member of).<p>The word ""god"" has also taken on a whole different meaning. The word god used to mean someone with authority and power. For example: In the bible Jezus applies the word ""gods"" to human judges? By this definition it's obvious that there are gods, many even. [We could then reserve the word ""God"" (with a capital letter) for the hypothetical entity which has no authority above him. Which leads to the weird conclusion that (this hypothetical) God would be the only true atheist: a-theist, without-god.]<p>The word ""natural"" is also confusing. Regardless of what we personally may think: Assume for a moment that the universe was created by someone who was not created. Now we have the situation that the universe is not ""natural"", but rather ""artificial"". The only thing natural would be this creator who what no created.<p>This makes it currently impossible to reason from within science about intelligent design. Intelligent design is not inherently unscientific, but it does challenge some of the most basis assumptions at the basis of modern day science: The unproven (and perhaps unprovable) conviction that Life, the universe and the rest are all purely natural (and not artificial).<p>The word ""supernatural"" is also meaningless. Just try to define any observable phenomenon which is neither natural nor artificial? By implicit definition no observable phenomenon could ever be labeled supernatural. Just the fact that we are able to observe it either makes it natural or artificial. Logic leaves no room for anything else.",1278327861

Music has never been a ""career""-choice that your parents would be happy with. The prerequisite to becoming successful with music is talent. Not even necessarily musical talent (although that obviously helps), but at least a talent in entertaining people with whatever kind of noise you're able to make.

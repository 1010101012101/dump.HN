I split the screen in half- browser or shell on one side and Sublime on the other. So Sublime gets 1280 pixels.<p>With the project side panel open enough to see most of the project's directories it uses ~370px. The minimap (which I do leave open, and use, often) takes up ~50 pixels and the scroll bar for the edit window a final ~20 leaving me with 840 pixels that can show just at 100 columns. If I kill the minimap I get almost exactly 120 cols.<p>For me, I have no qualms about 79 cols for the limit and enjoy being able to use my windows split to half the screen and still have some breathing room around the right edge of my code.

I see this argument pop up a lot against things like vi and Emacs as well.<p>Yes, we realize that monitors are bigger, resolutions are higher, etc ad naseum. None of that matters. What matters is code readability. So what if you can fit 120 characters in your code editing window? I can fit more than 400 across two monitors, should the new line length limit be 400? Why stop there, why not just let lines be endless and have the editor wrap them?

But I don't think those were the big reasons. Look at how the web works:<p>1) Web pages work on all relevant platforms. If someone creates a new browser, most existing web pages will render on it, and failures are in the nature of bug fixes rather than complete rewrites. Compare this with e.g. new operating systems and C programs.<p>2) If you change the web page, the update is available immediately to everyone. Compare this to the morass of outdated, incompatible and vulnerable software on your typical Windows box.<p>3) All the code effectively runs in a sandbox. Users generally don't have to worry about clicking on a link and having it send virus spam to everyone in their contact list.<p>Those are some huge advantages. Advantages that more than make up for the fact that web development is a huge pile of kludges built against each other that only hasn't been discarded and replaced entirely as a result of the massive amount of mutual interdependence.<p>The primary competitor to the web was Java. But Java was hampered by horrible mismanagement on the part of Sun and repeated malicious attempts to destroy it on the part of Microsoft, so the web won. Which is probably unfortunate.

In this case, OP, you've ""mixed metaphors"" so to speak - your title is about tables, but then you mix in inline-styles and non-responsive which open the possibilities of the answers quite a bit. I think your question can be broken into two parts: (1) the design of HN, and (2) the tech parts.<p>1) Over the years, people have posted many suggested HN redesigns. Inevitably, they've made much more whitespace - making it more like {reddit | digg | etc} - and people always are polarizing in their comments (""Hate it - how can I function with this many scrolls?!?!"" or ""Love it - HN looks like crap currently!""). I suspect the ""Love the current design"" crowd is/has been in the majority or perhaps pg himself is in that group - either way, I've yet to see a redesign post that a large group of the community embraced. The end result: the majority of people seem like the way it is now so nothing has changed.<p>2) For the tech aspect, I have to ask whether you see ""HTML-tables, inline-styling"" as perhaps the reasons behind the ""non-responsive""? Do you propose that moving to a CSS-based grid system with external stylesheets would make the system so much more responsive that we wouldn't have trouble? That's not necessarily the correlation you've drawn in the OP but it is possible that you think these are the reasons, I suppose (or contributing factors). pg/admins have talked about the server before (and it's recently been upgraded/replaced). They've also talked about the DDOS attacks they have been under as well (I think they are on Cloudflare now to help mitigate this). In the end, it's a single server managing a large community.

So, a good way to make sure that someone is writing readable code, which is otherwise the overall goal of PEP8. But, sometimes there are lines of code that are perfectly readable, maybe even more readable, despite exceeding 80 characters, and which become less readable by doing line continuations. (I would argue that line continuations make everything less readable, almost all of the time.)<p>The other rule that I personally ignore, and when I'm managing a project I have my developers ignore, is the suggestion to use spaces instead of tab characters for indentation. Of course, with Python, you must use one or the other, but I prefer tabs.<p>In both cases, it comes down to my belief that individual coders should have the ability to customize their experience without forcing it on everyone else. When you use spaces instead of tabs, and indeed, when you use line continuations, you're forcing your (the author's) exact view of the source code on everyone you're working with. If you use tabs, and don't use line continuations, others with specific needs (2 character tabs, 4 character tabs, 8 character tabs, 60 character-width editors, 100 character-width editors, etc.) can, with any modern editor, customize their view (using variable-width tab stops, and soft line wrapping) to what they're comfortable with.",1364222530

One would ask oneself what Nokia stands to gain, as it logically would make more sense for them to ask for a licence fee than to try to prevent VP8 from being used.<p>Of course, knowing that Microsoft holds the reigns at Nokia through Elop it's not that much of a mystery. Also highlighted by Nokia lying in their statement:<p>""We are now witnessing one company attempting to force the adoption of its proprietary technology, which offers no advantages over existing, widely deployed standards such as H.264 and infringes Nokia's intellectual property.""<p>The hypocrisy and outright lying is frightening. VP8 is not proprietary in any meaning of the word, while it's being developed pretty much solely by Google it's done so in fully open source fashion, through a public git repo. It's advantages is that it's geared towards real-time video and of course entirely royalty free, the latter being what rubs MPEGLA the wrong way.<p>A court (or likely several as the patents are applied in several countries) will have to decide upon the validity of these patents. But of course the whole point of this is again to throw a patent cloud over VP8 in order to prevent it from being standarised as part of HTML5/VP8, these proceedings will take time during which h264 will likely have time to entrench itself as the HTML5 video option despite not being an official mandatory implementation.<p>The stakes are high as the members of MPEGLA are expecting to cash in on royalties by cornering the video codec market, and obviously a roaylty free quality codec is an enormous threat to their continous royalty-based cash flow.<p>I guess it should have have caused alarm when MPEGLA backed off VP8 like they did, I can ony assume they knew of this impending patent suit from Nokia.<p>I really hope Google stays the course and fights Nokia, but of course then some other sock puppet patent holder will likely emerge. In short, I don't see a chance in hell anymore that we will be able to benefit from a royalty free web standard and all the potential that this holds.<p>If Google backs off trying to standarise VP8 I'm certain MPEGLA cohorts will stop harassing them, unfortulately this means we will have an effective monopoly in the video codec market and that's bad for everyone but the MPEGLA members.<p>And what can I say about Nokia, a company I once held in great regard, now a Microsoft subsidiary in all but writing, led by a major Microsoft shareholder, how sad.",1364222419

But then the question becomes one of what evidence do you accept.  Do you accept the evidence of your own senses while in a non-ordinary state of consciousness?  If not, why not?  Do you accept as evidence the communication you or others may have had with what you or they consider spirits of other worlds?  Do you accept the evidence of sacred writings?  Etc..<p>Perhaps you don't.  But is there an empirical reason for not counting this as evidence?  It's not like you can ""scientifically measure"" which criteria are ""better"".

Once upon a time we were limited to 80 characters but we were also limited to monochrome ASCII text.  Just as syntax highlighting improves readability, I think the <i>occasional</i> use of longer lines <i>where appropriate</i> improves readability - the shape of the code gives your eye additional clues about where you are in a section of code, allows you to have more lines on the screen at once, find what you're looking for faster, and isolates details that aren't crucial in getting the big picture.  E.g. - inline lambdas or anonymous functions, strings, etc.<p>When I work on a codebase with formatting standards I try to follow them.  This is 2013, though, and when I work on my own stuff I format it to get the most readability on my Macbook or 32"" 1080p desktop screen, not a VT100 from 1987.",1364221828

How does everything fit together? How should I handle templates? How to I create nested models? How do I stop thinking ""in jQuery"" and start thinking ""in Backbone""?<p>I guess the thing is that the current documentation works really well when you understand Backbone. Before you understand it, getting started is really difficult. That's why we see so many getting started guides all around  the problem of course being that most of them are barely just ok. Backbone should have a really, really good getting started guide, which (I think) should be more opinionated than Backbone itself  i.e. it shows one (really good) way of doing things (that works well when you scale up your application). Or at least link to one.<p>I've heard many say ""look at the todo example"", but I think that it's so far away from a real app that it's difficult to use as a starting point. It doesn't use ajax, it relies heavily on global state, it puts templates in the HTML, lots of global `$` stuff, no routing, etcetc. Ok-ish choices, but not a great example for those getting started. E.g. having templates in the DOM is ok when you have 5 views. When you have more it's problematic, especially for testing and for precompiling templates.<p>Backbone is great when you grok it, but it takes a lot of time to find your own patterns that works really well.

Students taking the exam should know that rubric inside and out, so I think it's fair even though the requirement isn't directly related to writing. Arbitrary requirements are part of life. Students also have to wear clothes during the exam even though you don't need clothes to write; I'm sure many great authors have done their best work in a state of dress that would be completely unacceptable in an AP exam.",1364752780

The point is that all light levels are doubled. The distorted version is that this only works for low light brightness levels.<p>Does this error matter? Yes, it does -- doubling all light levels means all exposure times can be cut in half, or if the same exposures are used, noise figures are reduced to 50%.

I switch between wanting to focus on security, to mobile development to system administration to game development. It seems like everyone around me has a clear-cut plan of what they want to do after their education, such as getting certain certifications, or taking a job where they have been an intern. I really don't to leave college to become part of a big corporate object, I'm not even sure if I'll be able to adapt properly to such a different culture.<p>Right now I've been working on a number of side projects at my own leisure, and one in particular is taking on a relatively impressive form. Without going into boring details, I plan on making a comprehensive 2D engine, with it's own very robust asset creation programs and level editor, which can export to Windows, Mac, Linux and (with a little more work) Android. It's one project that I'm very passionate about. I'm thinking of creating a start-up off of it, but putting myself out there in such a competitive market terrifies me, especially because I know nothing about how to run a small business.<p>I have a professor who has told me that starting a company as early as possible is the best way to both progress in the business world, as well as financially and in terms of experience. For me, it seems that if my product becomes even remotely successful, I might be able to dodge the ""corporate grind"" that I am dreading. Seeing this project's completion before the end of my education seems to me to be the only way to avoid my fears. Is this a good idea?

Suppose Stanford costs $60k and offers a $40k aid package, while MIT costs $58k and offers a $45k aid package.  In that case, both schools might agree to offer a $42k package, so that the $7k difference in out-of-pocket costs gets narrowed to $2k.<p>Coordination of financial aid makes coordination of admissions unnecessary, as it prevents schools from ""stealing"" students from each other by offering higher aid packages.",1364750126

However, human's cultural filters are not perfect, and there are lots of good ideas and intellectual context that can be exceedingly valuable to understanding how things became the way they are, or demonstrating alternative paths (which may even be better than what we have today) that did not emerge for market, financial, or cultural reasons.<p>I really find historical technology to be edifying in the same way political, musical, and broader cultural history is edifying.

""Congress shall make no law"". Every court that has confronted the First Amendment has pointed out that there's very little wiggle room in it. <i>And yet there is room to maneuver in the First Amendment</i>. You can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded movie theater; you can't stand outside a small-town prison and encourage a mob to lynch one of its inmates.

Do you think the Framers just slipped up and wrote one of the most important amendments in the Bill of Rights sloppily? Or do you, like every Supreme Court since the ratification of the Constitution, think that the Fourth Amendment is designed to balance the needs of the state against those of the people, and that's why they put a wildcard like ""reasonable"" in the text?<p>TSA searches are lawful under the ""Administrative Search"" doctrine. Searches can be allowed as ""administrative"" when they are (a) not targeted to specific classes of people, (b) avoidable --- as in, nobody is coming to your house or stopping your car on the road to search you, and (c) balanced against a legitimate need of the state (in this case, the safety of commercial airliners).<p>I think the TSA is patently ridiculous and they piss me off just as much as they piss you off.

1650680,comment,1650051,1650502,0,0,jbz,,,"Thats why it felt like a cheap detour to me. To me it read like Linq is completely unchangeable and you're stuck with what MS/C# language dictates it is, but almost every single component of it can be swapped out with your own implementation and overloads that in practice you can do much of what is implied as unachievable. Its been so long ive lost some of my grasp on it, but from what I recall you can swap out even the core methods that the C# sentence type syntax ends up being converted to, now is that not really close to what was highlighted in the article as impossible? With expression trees added on top to build out queries with decision trees during runtime you can make it work against whatever kind of datastore youre interacting with. In the end I felt its not nearly as immovable as portrayed in the article, and at the time i felt like the article was past its prime since it had been an hour with few comments - though im kinda wishing I kept my mouth shut now that theres been an invasion of comments.<p>To start splitting hairs about exact definition of what was written in the article seems to miss the point to me, the general flow and feel was dismissive of its ability. Is it clumsier? From what I can tell so far yes its clumsier, but its not powerless and immovable which is how it came off. Maybe im just sensitive though, or maybe im insensitive in how i portrayed my argument, but I really did just meant my original comment as constructive criticism.",1283284626

A typical workstation on the network costs the Navy $2,490.72 per year.""<p>A secure workstation with full outsourced support costs $2,490.72 a year?  That sounds pretty damn good to me.<p>* ""That includes an e-mail inbox with a 50-MB capacity (Gmail’s: 7,500 MB), and 700 MB of network storage (compared to Evernote’s unlimited, free plan). Anything above that is extra.""<p>Most corporations give their staff 150mb inboxes.  Let's see Google meet the military's requirements at 7,500mb per inbox.  Better yet, let's see Evernote give the military unlimited storage space.  I bet they could meet all of those requirements for free!  The public market client is exactly the same as the Department of the Navy, so it should be a quick switcher-oo!  Problem solved!<p>* ""A year’s use of a “high-end graphics” workstation sets the Navy back $4,085.64. Extra applications on a laptop or desktop computer can run anywhere from $1,006.68 to $4,026.72 annually. A classified Ethernet port — $9,300 to $28,800 per year, depending on where it’s located.""<p>Yup, that sounds about right.  High-end graphics workstations and their software are expensive.  So are classified networks.<p>* ""What’s more, HP isn’t required to take security measures like hard disk encryption, threat heuristics, and network access control that are common today, but were exotic in 2000.<p>Really?  They're not taking any security measures?!<p>“Anti-spam services” runs the Navy $2.7 million per year under the contract.""<p>It costs $2.7 million to filter spam on the second biggest network in the world?

The Navy sets the protocol for how these incidents are handled, you can't simply dump a computer into an incinerator and certify that the data is destroyed.  Well, I suppose you could, but running an incinerator at the level of heat required to completely destroy data is FREAKING EXPENSIVE, TOO.<p>In the several parts of the article that they mention lack of what sounds like quality response tie and botched security updates/software roll outs there isn't enough evidence on the incidents to make any comment.

1650531,comment,1648578,1648578,0,0,bobwaycott,,,"I found programming a slow, grueling task until I had an ephiphany one day--it's like learning any other [spoken] language. Now, I don't know if you're particularly adept at picking up foreign languages, but the moment I realized programming itself was the new language, I began viewing programming languages through the lens of learning a new grammar or syntax or vocabulary, and everything opened up for me. This was the same way things went with learning a foreign language--once I understood that I was still just expressing myself verbally, saying the same thoughts, it was only a matter of vocabulary, grammar, and syntax.<p>Since then, I have picked up new languages that interest me far more rapidly. I don't focus on how it compares to any other language I know or use. I don't focus on it from the perspective of how classes and functions differ. I look at any new programming language from a grammatical and syntactic view--and once I have read enough code & documentation to understand its grammar and syntax, I can start coding productively. That's the point I begin studying classes, functions, built-ins, libraries--the grammar and vocabulary of implementation.<p>I am by no means an expert programmer. I'd never call myself that. But I do find that many would be better programmers if they understood the ""language"" of programming. Learn as much as you can stand about data structures & types. This is core--especially types. I have so often been frustrated by inherited code that didn't show a solid understanding of data types (e.g., strings, ints, arrays, etc.). Learn about classes, functions, inheritance, etc. These are the building blocks of language, if you'll permit extending the analogy--it's a bit like knowing how to structure a sentence, capitalize, punctuate, etc. Learn the language of programming before you ever try to learn a programming language. This is, perhaps, what you're missing. You're using a programming language to understand programming. Take a step back and understand programming itself first. Then sit back down with your language and do programming.<p>Regardless of chosen language, the task is the same and the result should (usually) be the same. The chosen language is really just an implementation detail. You can write a program in Ruby, Python, C, PHP, etc., and it's still going to be the same program. Most programmers, I believe, tend to choose the grammar & syntax they like best. But the job of programming remains the same.",1283281591

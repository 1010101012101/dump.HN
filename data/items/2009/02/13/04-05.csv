I like having things under my own control. I like having my own editor be local. I do use ssh so I can edit from other's computers. I also sync my various computers so that I can edit from any of them. I guess part of it is a nostalgic feeling. I just believe somethings are better left local.<p>My other issue which is just an extension of the first is how they talk about writing a sort function. Yes its cool you can write a sort function but they are reinventing the wheel as he admits. 'Normally I would just use a unix command.' (paraphrase). No longer will all of your computing actions tie together. Learning to do something in Bespin doesn't carry over to other actions on the web. Particularly if its with another company. In unix learning to use vim allows you to not only write code but edit email. Learning wc lets you use it with code, with email, with anything you write.",1234501048

I therefore also believe that programmers expend great effort over the course of their careers optimizing their work habits to maximize productivity.<p>All programmers are different, but none of us is completely different from all others. There is much to be gained from examining what the others have learned in the process of programming. The danger in this is thinking that there is some objective Truth in programming productivity.<p>So, Bob disagrees with Alice over what makes a programmer productive. Assuming both Bob and Alice are effective programmers, what we should really be examining are the ideas they have in common.<p>For me, reading programming blogs from around the Internet gives me a giant mental Venn diagram--the ideas in the center are what I focus on.",1234500805

Once you define a metric, it's easy to measure yourself against it.  Lines of code?  Easy to measure.  Weeks taken to ship something?  Easy to measure.  Number of features completed on your checklist?  Easy, if you made a checklist.<p>None of these metrics are perfect, but they're a heck of a lot better than nothing, or ""I don't know"".  You can iterate, and refine the estimates as you go along.  Just make a conscious effort to measure <i>something</i>.  Getting actual data trumps all these endless arguments.",1234500114

If the population of the USA keeps increasing, this country has to move forward into more urbanization, more density, and higher buildings and mass transit. When I moved to California, I was surprised that its architecture had more in common with the Midwest than with the more urban east coast.    Appart from SF, you have to have a car to go anywhere.  In the east coast, from Boston, to D.C. you can get along fine with urban transport + zip car.\nBut I realized, most of the cities in the east coast were created centuries ago, and were made for people, and not cars, and tend to have higher densities (even comparing suburbs to suburbs).  Unfortunately, most Cities in CA, were made for cars. (with SF being the exception).<p>There will be natural forces that will make cities to increase their density.  LA is already a big giant parking lot,  how much further can it expand?  All the bay area highways (all 5 lanes ), are already clogged all the time.

479433,comment,478807,479379,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Thanks for the reply - After you that the majority of H1-B's are going to Indian outsourcing firms, I took a look at the demographics and stastics to see if that's true. Here's what I found:<p>India accounts for the most H1-B visas at 102,382 since 2005. The next highest is the United Kingdom at 30,755. That's interesting - India does account for 25% of H1-B's, however the rest of the top 10 is: UK, Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Japan, China, Venezuela, South Korea. Six of the top 10 are wealthy countries with high standards of living - the people from those countries are quite likely skilled professionals.<p>The government should work to clear up and end abuses of the H1-B program to bring unskilled laborers over here, but that's not what the majority of the program is doing. Giving visas not bound to employer would straighten most of that out right away - it would take away the incentive for employers to get crummy people, because they couldn't pay undermarket wages.<p>As for India - I think the reason India is so highly represented is the same reason Ireland was 150 years ago: It's a poor country with people who want to work hard and make it in America. I think some people (not you) cite the India thing and plays as a sort of latent racist card. ""Those damn Indians, taking our jobs!"" Why shouldn't Indians come over here? There's some damn brilliant Indians with nothing going on for them in India. The best and brightest want to come here, just liked we've seen whenever there's been a famine or poverty in a country. America's been built by people who came here for a better life.<p>So okay, only 25% of H1-B's are to Indians, and not all of those (obviously) are outsourcing firms or an abuse of the program. As for the Sergey Brin comment - the author was writing how we should restrict immigration because it costs Americans jobs. My point is if immigration was stricter in the 70's and the Brin family hadn't been allowed to come to the USA, then we'd all be worse off. I say get as many bright and hardworking people here as possible, however we can, and loosen up immigration for anyone who'll be a good citizen in a field there's demand for. I agree with you that we should cut down on unskilled laborers abusing the program, and get better filtering criteria. But I've worked with some amazing Indian coders, and those are people I'd love to have over here to drink tea with, sit on the beach with, talk code and business and Chess, and see them raise their kids to be Americans if they get citizenship, or be grateful for the contributions they made to our economy and way of life if they go home.",1234499020

The Wynn is the only casino I know of where all of them have $100s.<p>And most non-casino ATMs have a per transaction limit of $600-$800, independent of your card's limit. You can do multiple transactions, but you'll get $20s every time. This too varies a bit in Vegas and AC, where you can find much higher limits, but again only in the right ATMs in the right casinos.<p>Vegas casinos have a rule that they will only trade you up to $500 in $100s for lower denominations per casino per day.

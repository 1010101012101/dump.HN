It seems much wiser to wait till you have an idea that you want to pursue and then quit.</i><p>If you follow that course, you'll <i>never</i> quit. Because nothing stops you figuring out what you really want to do with your life like being continually busy, chasing someone else's dream.<p>Time flies when you're busy.<p>Back when I was young and inexperienced I took some bad career advice and pushed myself through a degree in a medical profession, and then postgraduate training. With 20/20 hindsight I was utterly unsuited to the profession, temperamentally. But I was too busy to see that I was making myself unhappy (and doing a second-rate job in the process). It took 18 months of post-qualification work to get around to the idea that I ought to bail, write off the previous six years, and go back to square one, and another year to put the plan into effect. Why? Because I was <i>busy</i>. In the end I wasted seven years on a mistake that was clear by the end of my first year at university.<p>You only have one life. Use it wisely. If you find you're doing something that doesn't agree with you, think very hard before you push on indefinitely: nobody's going to give you those years back.",1277200750

And who says this is a good rationale to base the rules on?<p>The whole point of playing a game as a child, IMO, is to learn the basic skills of the game as well as possible and to have fun. Do you think the street kids of Brazil and Argentina, some of whom grow up to be some of the finest natural footballers in the world, worry about the pair of t-shirts they use as goalposts isn't FIFA regulated, or the battered  football they use isn't either?<p>The whole point of playing the game at amateur level when you are older is to play the game you have loved since you were a child. Do you think every amateur game even has 2 linesmen to aid the ref?<p>This is a totally different proposition to watching the World Cup, Champions League, English Premiership, La Liga or the Serie A. Millions of fans tune in and watch these high-level games, and billions of euros are generated by the sport. When Thierry Henry cheats by blatantly handling the ball, incorrectly getting France into the World Cup, when Kaka, one of the greats of the modern game, gets sent off by some diving, cheating pr*ck, when the ref disallows a perfectly legit goal for the USA, millions of fans are turned off by this crap. Diving is another huge area which is wrecking soccer too. Video refereeing and being able to appeal obviously incorrect decisions like most other modern sports is badly needed to bring the game into the 21st century.<p>The argument about video refereeing slowing the game down doesn't stand up either. At least trial the system for a few months in major competitions where the necessary equipment already is in place - if it doesn't work after that, then I've got egg on my face. People who argue the reverse are mired in the past, and don't have the balls and vision to at least experiment with something that could bring on a new level of professionalism, and fairness to the sport instead of rewarding cheaters and divers.",1277200222

1451394,comment,1451125,1451360,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I think this is just differing perspectives; a lot of what you highlight, for me, makes US sports unwatchable (as i said elsewhere I can't watch all of a baseball game simply through boredom - despite quite liking the game).<p>(though for the record post-mortems, referee training etc. are good ideas)<p><i>Referees should be required to make distinguishing hand signals for each call. This would greatly aid the players, the fans, and the commentators in determining exactly what the ruling was.</i><p>This is the case - hand signals are pretty conclusive in Football (and relatively simple).<p><i>Offsides should always be ""tie goes to the offense"".</i><p>Ouch, no. You'd see far too many goals scored like this; in fact from my observation the way it comes out if ""tie could go both ways"" - which makes it all the more fun/difficult to play. And more importantly keeps it relatively fair. I dislike sports that are ""binary"" - i.e. if it's A it's A. In football sometimes it is A but the ref calls B.<p><i>For minor fouls in the box on set pieces, there should be discretionary power to the referee to retake or reverse the direction of the kick instead of either calling a game altering PK or doing nothing (and thus providing an incentive for questionable behavior in the box). There's simply insufficient granularity there. Minor defensive holding should generate a warning and another kick from the same spot for another scoring chance (but at a much lower scoring percentage than PK).</i><p>See this is what frustrates me about US sports... it starts to get complicated. There is no need to introduce this complexity because the game is already well defined and correctly played in this area.<p><i>If a player leaves the field of play for an injury, or is down for more than 1 minute, the player should not be able to return for 5 minutes.</i><p>This just demonstrates, IMO, a misunderstanding of the game. 5 minutes may be no time in, say, American Football. In Football the game could be entirely changed in 5 minutes.<p>I think the biggest problem is that compared to many US sports Football is an extremely fast moving game that relies on being able to run smoothly and cohesively. For example if the ball goes out of bounds it could easily be thrown back in within just a few seconds and the momentum of the game continues (for me this is what I enjoy most).<p>There is, obviously, a culture difference. I think that is why I find US sports quite boring and unwatchable and some Americans want to change/slow/formalise football. I think... each to our own thank you :)<p>In my mind football is a perfect spectator sport because of the ""flaws"" introduced by human error. They make a game less predictable, more excruciating, provide human emotion etc.<p>(although I do think the current crop of players are a bunch of spoiled brats and need to be reminded of the <i>real</i> game)",1277199579

1451392,comment,1450518,1450518,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"As an American, I remember back when the Republicans passed the ""Personal Accountability Act"" or some such. The gist was that credit card debt was going to be even harder to get out of when a person goes bankrupt. The spin? People need to be responsible. When they make debts, they have a moral obligation to pay them. Therefore, the government shouldn't help them do something immoral.<p>Never mind the fact that <i>the entire business model of credit is based on assuming a risk the borrower doesn't pay</i>. If government takes away that risk, well, it's like printing money. Which is exactly what the credit card companies are doing.<p>I was with the author until this point: <i>That’s what should happen in a healthy market. Credit and debit cards aren’t a healthy market. That’s why regulation is necessary.</i><p>Whoa. Hold on a minute. <i>Regulation is the tool of the monopolist, not his enemy</i>. I told the story about the Republicans to make a point: the game is for special interests like PACs to write legislation that then makes their members more powerful. The best (sometimes the only) way to do this is to pretend like you're regulating or cleaning up the industry in question.<p>So the Congressman who's all about cleaning up the finance industry? His staff is the one writing the 2,000 page bill that nobody understands yet somehow will be a boon to the finance industry in the next five years or so. When folks figure out that the bill actually made matters worse, he'll be the guy on TV telling us that what we need is actually <i>another</i> bill, much better than the first one, and the cycle continues. (Just got through reading a great article on just this process from an HN link: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2009/05/the-quiet-coup/7364/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2009/05/the-quiet-...</a>)<p>The answer, I think, is that government has a critical role in defining things. How about defining what a life insurance policy is? Make seven different levels. If you sell life insurance, you have to meet one of the levels. Or in this case creating a standardized P2P clearing process for payments? Nobody needs to force people to use it, heck, if you can standardize the way payments are made between parties such that the banks are mostly out of the picture? Visa and MasterCard just go away.<p>Not that this will happen. Too many connections and powerful people involved. But the point is that there is a spot between chaos and total regulation where government can and should do a lot of good. That point, in a lot of cases, is just in making definitions and forcing market players to use them. These choices are presented almost always as false dichotomies: one extreme or the other. That's because arguments sell newspapers and make people watch TV shows. It's also because in most cases politicians get more votes from the argument than from the solution (another reason why the regulatory bills that create new problems will come forth ad infinitum)",1277199459

Cycling is a great alternative to driving (or taking public transit), but it's a horrible alternative to walking until you are at or near your target. Replacing a half-hour walk with a five-minute bike trip rather defeats the purpose.<p>Walking is great -- you'll need to pick up the distance soon, though, and perhaps make it a daily thing. As you walk more (and as you lose weight) your body will get better at walking. And don't worry too much about the food intake -- learn to listen to your body's needs rather than its wants. It can happen. If you are walking about an hour a day for exercise (along with the normal shuffling about), you should probably be able to get by on something in the neighborhood of 1500 calories -- and that can represent a lot of food if you're eating the right stuff, so feeling hungry doesn't have to be part of the deal. (Keep the time and effort constant -- if you're walking about 3 mph now, you'll find it steps up to 4 mph pretty much by itself. I regularly catch and pass ""joggers"" these days.)<p>I've lost just a little bit more than 160 pounds, but I started at a slightly more modest 300-ish (just shy). Just walking, dumping the egregiously horrid foodstuffs and being engaged with the meal I'm eating (rather than absently putting stuff in my mouth while doing other things) did almost all of the work.

Managing calories in doesn't have to be hard -- it's more about mindfulness than about absolute quantity. It's keeping that arse in gear, even if that means low gear until your capabilities catch up with your ambition, that makes the big difference.",1277198374

1451360,comment,1451125,1451125,0,0,bukkake,,,"The argument outlined in the article is absurd.  Soccer is and has been by far the most popular sport participation wise in the USA for decades.  I played and refereed it competitively for close to two decades until I started having problems with my knees.  Most Americans are very well versed in soccer and have either played it themselves or have at least watched their kids play it.<p>Most Americans have no problems with soccer as a recreational sport.  However, from our perspective, there are major problems with it as it currently exists as a spectator sport.<p>All American spectator sports are extremely fine tuned affairs.  Every American sport's officiating body does a complete post-mortem of every single call in every single game and annotates them extensively.  This information is used to educate individual referees and to supply information to rules committees for possible future fine tuning of the rules.  At the minimum, the rules committees issue an objective and annotated series of""points of emphasis"" each year for officials so they can call the game in a fairer manner.<p>In every American sport, unsportsmanlike conduct is dealt with in the harshest manner possible.  It is not uncommon for an unsportsmanlike foul to be undetected during the game but later caught by the reviewing body during the post-mortem analysis.  You will often see $10,000, $50,000, or $100,000 fines to the players and even suspensions if the infraction is deemed worthy enough.<p>As I see it, there are several particularly glaring problems with international soccer:<p>1.  There is no post-mortem review process that has teeth.  If the Ivory coast player that was involved in that incredibly unsportsmanlike dive was retroactively red-carded (i.e. suspended) and the team's country fined, then it would provide a disincentive for this kind of behavior.<p>2.  Officiating standards are laughable.  There is an unacceptably large amount of variation between referees regarding what is and is not legal play.  This makes it very difficult for teams to plan matchups and it condemns every game to a lengthy ""feeling-out process"" where, by trial and error, the sides determine the refereeing standards.  This is not to say that there is no room for subjectivity; what I'm saying is that you have effective anarchy right now and it's a turnoff for American viewers.<p>3.  Post-mortem review should also revert suspect yellows and reds.  What good does it do for the game to have Kaka out for the Brazil / Portugal match?  Nothing.  In fact, it actively harms the game.<p>4.  Offsides should always be ""tie goes to the offense"".  There is no compelling reason to blow extremely close plays dead because the offensive player just might have been offsides by 6 inches.  FIFA should issue a ""point of emphasis"" stating that ""ties go to the offense"".<p>5.  There needs to be more than one referee.  The article makes bogus points about ""scaling down"".  You already have linesmen and a 4th ref that does nothing but hold up a substitution sign and do paperwork.  There should be at least one and preferably two more referees so that the on-field officials have multiple views.  One referee should be a head referee (as is already done), and the others subject to overrule.<p>6.  Referees should train as groups and speak a common language.  This is even more important for an international world championship event.  This is just common sense.<p>7.  Referees should be required to make distinguishing hand signals for each call.  This would greatly aid the players, the fans, and the commentators in determining exactly what the ruling was.<p>8.  For minor fouls in the box on set pieces, there should be discretionary power to the referee to retake or reverse the direction of the kick instead of either calling a game altering PK or doing nothing (and thus providing an incentive for questionable behavior in the box).  There's simply insufficient granularity there.  Minor defensive holding should generate a warning and another kick from the same spot for another scoring chance (but at a much lower scoring percentage than PK).<p>10.  If a player leaves the field of play for an injury, or is down for more than 1 minute, the player should not be able to return for 5 minutes.  This would provide a disincentive for players to fake injury.",1277198034

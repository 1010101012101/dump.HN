So first step is to fine &quot;easy jobs&quot; that you can solve faster then others, and sort out the bad customers. I offer 2% discount if they pay invoices within a week. Only two type of customers would pay late: Those with a cash flow problem, and those with an account problem. Drop them! Also drop any kind of toxic customers. Keep the good ones.<p>Offer a maintenance contract of $50 per month for the server and the software to the good customer. A year later you will have 4 or 5 contracts paying half of your bill, for doing backups once a week, installing security updates, writing invoices, and perhaps sometimes writing an email to the customer or even patching a bug.<p>You can play around with own ideas, once you have a semi passive income.

I started a community websites since 2006 which generates me around $1500/mo in passive income.<p>Have you any ideas what tools might make your (dev) life easier? You can create a small productive/utility SaaS app. Use bootstrap if you don&#x27;t have any design skills. Use PayPal/Stripe to setup a (recurring) payment system in a day.<p>Test using lean methodology, buy a domain, create landing page with bootstrap, pricing page, and a fake sign up page. Takes max a week. Then spend another one week driving some traffic from Google/Facebook ads to see if there&#x27;s any interest. Usually Facebook, if targeted well, is way cheaper. Start using Google once you know your LTV (Life Time Value of customer) and conversion. Start by spending for example $20.<p>One tip: Don&#x27;t target US customers in Facebook for polling interest, they are harder to convert, and from my experience around 10x/20x more expensive than Asian/Spanish speaking countries.<p>After you see interest, try to find a quick way to see if people are willing to pay. This might not as easy as most users want to use your product before paying. You might explain the product in better detail after the signup and ask what they want to pay for it.<p>After you are able to confirm if people are willing to pay for your service, only then spend serious time building.<p>You can apply the same tactic if you&#x27;re selling an e-book, maybe the spices idea as someone mentioned before.<p>Good luck!",1409406368

No, they used properly titrated extract prepared by those eeeeevil drug companies.<p>Or what if you&#x27;re concerned about THC exposure?  As I understand it, it&#x27;s at least associated, perhaps correlated, with some very unpleasant things, like an increased incidence of schizophrenia.<p>All drugs, whatever the source, are dangerous, and will harm and kill small fractions of the people who might take them.<p>Comparing the mass quantities of stuff you get from normal eating to the low doses of these drugs, whatever the source, is not, I think relevant.  You can reasonably expect different concentrations of essential foodstuffs to balance out, and for vitamins and some minerals take a generic one a day pill to make sure you don&#x27;t inadvertently get any deficiency diseases.",1409404898

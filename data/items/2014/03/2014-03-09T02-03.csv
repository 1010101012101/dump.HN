However, if you really want a decimal standard, then, as I mentioned above, there already is one that is part of the IEEE 754 standard. Not only do there exist hardware implementations, but there are also high-quality software implementations.<p>A better approach to making things more intuitive in all bases, not just base 10, is using rational numbers.

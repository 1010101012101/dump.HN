10431485,comment,10430675,10431302,0,0,tim333,,,"I&#x27;m not sure your explanation for the lack of spookiness in many worlds works. The essence of most Bell&#x27;s Theorems experiments is you start with entangled photons (or similar), they travel a long way apart and then go through polarisers at either end and into detectors. The odd thing is that the number getting through both slits depends on the angle between the polarisers. But how does the photon at polariser 1 know what the orientation of polariser 2 is at the time it&#x27;s pair photo gets there? You can spin the polariser and the chances of it getting through depends on the orientation when the photon gets there, not when it set off. You&#x27;d think it can&#x27;t but experimentally it does. I don&#x27;t see how that weirdness goes away with many worlds.<p>(Bell&#x27;s theorem is basically maths to figure out if the photons have to &#x27;know&#x27; the angle between the polarisers rather than just say start off with the same polarisation.)",1445511220

I&#x27;ve been doing well with understanding the implications of the test and the after effects but I struggled with understanding the state of the two particles themselves. Namely, the trouble was with understanding that no one but the people who entangled the particles are actually aware that they are entangled. There is no way for a stranger to look at two particles (given they were entangled by someone else) that those particles are entangled. They&#x27;ll look like two normal particles. The answers here have helped me understand this.",1445511206

A supermarket with 8 brands and 38 total selections didn&#x27;t take the time to help me. I suppose it&#x27;s like when non-techies walk into Best Buy and there are 40 laptops to choose from, ranging from Atoms/Celerons to various i7 types. We have all done it before on the phone: &quot;anything but the Celeron... yes it&#x27;s cheaper... but it&#x27;s slow, just don&#x27;t get those&quot; - basically we narrow down the selection significantly by saying &quot;at least 4GB ram, i3,i5,i7&quot;.<p>The analogy is not perfect because there&#x27;s a big price difference in laptops. But making the consumer feel &quot;safer&quot; with their choice by eliminating the really <i>bad</i> choices up front lets them shop worry-free. This small selection thing can be bad too, though - I for one hate shopping at Walmart because I <i>know</i> without a doubt that whatever I am purchasing is the absolute lowest common denominator in terms of quality. They might have 2 different types of lawn chairs, and you better believe that both will fall apart just after the 1 year warranty is up. It all comes down to trust; if you trust the store in their selection, you&#x27;ll enjoy shopping there.",1445511134

I know my name has been added on pictures by my sister, at a minimum. I&#x27;ve never had an account at FB and never will. I&#x27;m assuming it is common knowledge on HN that just because you haven&#x27;t registered an account with facebook doesn&#x27;t mean your account doesn&#x27;t exist.[1]<p>> That typing someone&#x27;s name without their consent should not be allowed?<p>Obviously not. This thread is about credit scores, which facebook shouldn&#x27;t be influencing based on hearsay. The bigger point is that &quot;failure to opt-out&quot; is not consent.<p>> Victim blaming is quickly becoming a term for &quot;I don&#x27;t like how the reality works, so I&#x27;ll just throw a temper tantrum&quot;.<p>Absolutely not. Just because technology has allowed a power shift away from individual rights doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s the way &quot;reality works&quot;. The entire point of law is that we shape these aspects of society. It is not a &quot;temper tantrum&quot; to point out that responsibility doesn&#x27;t fall upon the individual just because a rent-seeking corporation framed the discussion in that manner.<p>An easier to understand variant of this problem is so-called &quot;identity theft&quot;. Nobody can steal your identity. They can <i>impersonate</i> you, but you still are the same person. The actual problem is e.g. banks giving loans to people without properly verifying the identity of the person. As a 3rd party, the bank has no valid reason to involve you in their, but by calling it &quot;identity theft&quot; they re-frame the situation as if was the your responsibility to keep your identity from being stolen (which is basically impossible).<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/report-facebook-tracks-all-visitors-even-if-youre-not-a-user-and-opted-out/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/report-facebook-t...</a>",1445510637

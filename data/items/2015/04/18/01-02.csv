You might even say that what people find so appealing about Python 2.7 these days is that its syntax will never change.<p>Python 3 is not Perl 6, and that&#x27;s a banal comparison to make. Python 3 has had many releases, and has had most packages ported to it. Perl 6 has had <i>no</i> releases. Ruby 1.9 should be an example that making incompatible changes that force everyone to upgrade is <i>possible</i> as long as you make timely releases.<p>What gap do you still think there is to be narrowed? We&#x27;re not on 3.2 anymore. Complaining that &quot;it should not have taken until 3.3&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter now.<p>What most people are arguing is quite the opposite of you -- they&#x27;re saying they <i>could</i> switch to Python 3, and they <i>would</i> if there were a killer feature that mattered to them, but just being cleaner and making the core developers happier isn&#x27;t enough for them to change the way they use Python. So I say, bring on the killer features.",1429322382

Operations in a monadic context (I/O, mutating state, etc.) are generally not commutable - or if they are, the circumstances under which they are can be expressed in the definition of the monad.

Calls are supposed to put just the first argument in the A register, and everything else on the stack, save any potential register that an operation the function may use, and generally be painfully slow.<p>One of the things optimization does is figure out what rules it can break in order to make the program go faster -- when it can put more arguments in registers, because only the code being compiled will see that function, etc. So, in order to make compilers smarter and more intuitive, we have to agree to break binary compatibility, which is something people are rather gun shy about.

9398058,comment,9396950,9397851,0,0,mightybyte,,,"> Assuming f and g are not evaluated for their side-effects...<p>And that is the whole point.  In Haskell we can know that f and g have no side effects.  If they had side effects you would not be able to compose them with the dot operator.<p>I don&#x27;t quite understand your example but I assure you that there are elegant ways to accomplish that in Haskell.  There was recently a presentation [1] at the NY Haskell meetup that talked about a new Haskell sound synthesis library called vivid.<p>Making functions that perform side effects is also easy.  Here&#x27;s a simple example:<p><pre><code>    intToFile :: Int -> IO ()\n    intToFile anInt = do\n        writeFile &quot;myfile.txt&quot; (show anInt)\n</code></pre>\nThe idea that you have to be multiparadigm to function in real world settings is a fallacy.  Haskell is simply more expressive, which equips it to solve just about any problem with more clean and concise code than you&#x27;re likely to get in other languages.  Even if the code size stayed the same the extra safety you get from purity and strong types would be worth it alone.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo3zUvPsizo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo3zUvPsizo</a>",1429321562

9398056,comment,9396861,9396861,0,0,wampus,,,"I don&#x27;t understand why the genre matters. Most of the problems with shuffle play go away if you prune the songs you don&#x27;t like out of your collection. True randomness is fine if you follow a few basic principles:<p>1. Don&#x27;t repeat songs too soon. A record of the last 100 or so songs should be enough and doesn&#x27;t use much memory. If shuffling a short playlist or album, don&#x27;t repeat until they&#x27;ve all been played.<p>2. Don&#x27;t attempt to group similar sounding songs together. I&#x27;ve never seen an algorithm succeed at this and it serves no aesthetic purpose. If I want to maintain a mood, I&#x27;ll create a playlist, select songs manually, or just hit skip.<p>3. Don&#x27;t ignore new material. If I add, rename, or reorganize music I don&#x27;t want to do anything special for it to be included in the shuffle.<p>4. Don&#x27;t roll your own random algorithm. Ever since shuffle play was introduced as a feature on CD players, there have been algorithms that will play the same N out of X songs in a collection, clearly using some kind of modulo-based function instead of a good quality PRNG. If your algorithm can permanently exclude songs, it&#x27;s broken.<p>None of this helps with songs that should remain part of a suite or have a segue that is abruptly clipped, but some of those shouldn&#x27;t be separate tracks to begin with.",1429321509

Mechanical vibration materials is bound to have a series of resonances multiples of some basic frequency. So if you have a single person, or single object, emitting sound, you expect to see this nice harmonic lineup. When the fundamental frequencies don&#x27;t have a pair (a,b) s.t. a * f1=b * f2, their harmonic multiples don&#x27;t match and you can tell something is odd.<p>For f2=125% f1, for example, every 4th harmonic from f2 lines up perfectly; for f2=150% f1, every 2nd harmonic lines up; for f2= 200% f1, every harmonic actually lines up.

Channels in Golang are better - they at least have some syntactic support - but the reification of the yield point into a concrete channel can end up creating a fair bit of boilerplate in the common case where you make a bunch of one-off async RPCs to remote services.  Maybe Erlang has it right, where the pid is an implicit channel you can send messages to - but then you still need to pass that into any async library function, and it gives you no typing discipline.  Maybe we really need something like futures where the syntax:<p><pre><code>  y <- f(x)\n  z <- g(y)\n  w <- h(z)\n</code></pre>\nmeans &quot;wait for the promise returned by expression f(z) to resolve, returning control to the executor, and then assign the result to y.&quot;<p>The splitting-the-library-ecosystem thing is a big part of it too (and why ES6 won&#x27;t magically fix the Node ecosystem), but that&#x27;s why Python is putting async into the language & standard library itself.

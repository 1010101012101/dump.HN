3032562,comment,3032403,3032403,52,0,arn,,,"So, surprisingly, this rant is more or less accurate, imo. (I went to med school, residency, fellowship)<p>I mean some things stronger than others, but it hits on the major negatives as you go through training.  I know a lot of these rants tend to romanticize how hard people's own professions are in a ""no one else has it this hard"" type stance. We see similar ""how hard it is to be a programmer"" type rants as well.   But, I'll pull out the one aspect that I've always felt I lost.<p>""3) You will spend the best years of your life as a sleep-deprived, underpaid slave.""<p>I do feel like I missed being young (20s) and just having a regular job, enjoying life with my friends.  4 years of medical school, and 3 years of residency pretty much wipe out age 22-29. So I do regret that.",1316840287

If an academic writer includes a link to their code in their paper, when it goes through peer review before being published, it will no longer under be a blind review; the reviewer will know who wrote the code by virtue of the github account or domain it's uploaded to. Blind reviews are important, as if you know you're reviewing a paper by someone who rejected your paper, you're more inclined to reject it.

Why should CS paper writers show Jacques (or anyone else) their code?<p>We have discussed this topic on HN a number of times, for example:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2735537"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2735537</a>
<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2006749"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2006749</a><p>Many of the comments in those threads do a better job summing up than I ever could.  However, briefly, literally all of the incentives are aligned against publishing code and data.<p>If a writer's code is wrong, they are embarrassed (and there is no culture of being embarrassed by not publishing code).<p>If a writer publishes their code and it is actually good, someone else can scoop their follow-on results.<p>If a writer does not publish their code, and it is actually any good, they can potentially commercialize it thanks to the Bayh-Dole Act.<p>If a writer publishes their code and people intend to use it, the writer needs to clean it up, check it for correctness, and handle support requests.  These activities are probably more time consuming than writing the code in the first place.<p>If the writer publishes their code, and other people in the writer's field do not, the writer is usually at a disadvantage.  Others will appear to have more publications, the basic currency of academia.  (Many people have great reasons for not publishing their code or data, especially researchers embedded at large companies making changes to large proprietary systems.)<p>So overall, yes, it would be great if CS paper writers gave out their code.  What they are doing is not reproducible science in the philosophy of science sense.<p>But what is Jacques (or anyone else) doing to fix this system of incentives, and what could anyone do?",1316839516

There is a tremendous commitment to entering it. You must go to undergrad, medical school and residency (with standardized exams throughout) whereas for programming, there is no ""traditional"" path that you must follow. Moreover, although there is a tremendous rewardfinancial, societal and perhaps even moralat the end, that end only comes after 8+ years of extremely hard work. Compare that with programmers, athletes and businessmen who could make millions before they turn 30.

They really seem to put that Rework stuff into practice. Contrast those people to the Facebook-type companies that seem to essentially ignore individuals in favor of scale.<p>It IS possible for companies both large and small to provide some personal touches to their service and really make their users feel special. It pays dividends. The cost of those beer glasses and shipping was minimal, but the value added to their brand was incalculable. The best part is that they practice customer service like that quietly -- they aren't always talking about how great they are simply as a marketing ploy -- they quietly do great things.<p>For example, I am based in Shanghai and last weekend they had a server issue that affected some of my users' Basecamp access here in China (although for some reason my access had no issues) -- I emailed them about it and they responded back within a few hours with specific fixes they did in response to my general problem. They didn't just BS me and say that everything was now fine -- they actually took action. By the time I received their response, the problem was fixed and my users were back to full-speed access.<p>I've had similar good fortune with Andy Hunt and his folks at Pragmatic -- personal responses, sincere actions and quality followup. It's a simple formula that should be taught in business schools because so many companies seem to ignore that a single customer is the fundamental unit of your success (or failure.)<p>I have a little psychology app we developed and it's amazing how surprised users are when you take the time to email them back and respond to their suggestions, complaints or compliments directly. Just from my limited experience with my app users, it would appear that very few companies take a personalized, sincere interest in their users. Nearly every time I've responded to users emails (always within 8 hours, usually within 1,) I get a baffled response expressing appreciation. Excerpt: ""Wow! Thanks so much for getting back to me about [my suggestions.] I never expected a response at all, let alone such a nice email. I appreciate it that you'll be incorporating [some my feature requests] into [the app] so quickly.""<p>I'm not trying to blow my own horn, but merely illustrate that users are starved of personal respect and a sincere interest in them. Users should expect personal respect and thanks; it shouldn't come as a surprise! 37signals and some of the aforementioned companies (as well as Zappos et al,) are doing it right.

Rather than waiting for a predefined number of messages and/or predefined time interval, it sends all the messages available at the moment in one go. Imagine the network interface card is busy sending data. Once it is ready to send more data it asks MQ for new messages. MQ sends all the messages available at the moment. Does it harm the latency of the first message in the batch? No. The message won't be sent earlier anyway because the networking card was busy. On the contrary, latency of subsequent messages will be improved because sending single batch to the card is faster then sending lot of small messages. On the other hand, if network card isn't busy, the message is sent straight away without waiting for following messages. Thus it'll have the best possible latency.<p>EDIT: This is interesting too for super low latency, Myricom actually makes such a library (<a href=""http://www.myricom.com/kb/index.php?title=DBL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myricom.com/kb/index.php?title=DBL</a>).<p>> We are working on delivering MQ over alternative networking stacks, thus having advantage of features like kernel bypass, avoiding TCP/IP overhead, using high-performance networking hardware etc. That way we can get the latency as low as 10 microseconds.",1316838013

I understand why some algorithms (AKS, RSA) would not make sense if you just spit out the C code raw but I think it would make the paper much easier to understand if there was some code to go along with the formulas and descriptions, especially if the description is hard to decipher like ""analyze the performance of the differencing algorithm on random instances by mapping it to a nonlinear rate equation.""",1316837825

The trick is to just do it a <i>lot</i> and don't ever give up. Eventually it works.<p>I like your new stuff, interesting style.<p>I agree wholeheartedly that to learn a skill and do it well you have to really want it and spend a lot of time doing it.<p>I really wanted to be an artist when I was 8 through about 16. I stopped drawing cold turkey and didn't keep anything I drew but I did end up drawing two things in the last twelve years (!). The lessons I took from learning how to draw were invaluable though. You can learn anything you want as long as you a) really want it; and b) bash your head against the wall long enough to achieve it.<p>Here are the two drawings I mentioned: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.17270830489.47657.635750489&l=f005e0ee23&type=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.17270830489.47657.6...</a><p>After not picking up a pencil for half a decade for the first one I was fairly happy with the result.<p>Good luck on your journey.",1316837615

What is this if not ""a chauvinistic belief in the inferiority of women?"" Simple answer: it's an objective fact.<p>I find it amazingly unlikely that men and women are identically suited to every type of work. Men and women have historically, on evolutionary time scales, focussed on different types of activities.<p>You say ""I believe it's completely unacceptable to speculate on these matter"". That is labeling something as an unacceptable thought. You're saying ""I don't care what reality it, my morality trumps reality."" You are advocating creating categories of taboo thought crime.

Really, its even less because the $40k would be shared with my 2 co-founders.  I've been working at startups, and starting businesses for 20 years... I think they got me as a consultant cheap!<p>I really don't mind at all, of course. I think it is a great program and a great country.  Many years ago I visited Santiago Chile on a vacation, and I couldn't help but feel like the culture was very ""capitalist"" at the time.  Rather than the beggars you might find in many countries, the kids were selling coke or cigarettes, etc.  The cabbie we met at the airport was efficient, dedicated, responsive, and ended up providing all the rides we needed the whole trip.<p>If there's any people who are primed for the transition to a vibrant entrepreneurial culture, I think they are it.<p>But, $40k for at least one entrepreneur to come and spend 6 months meeting with local entrepreneurs seems reasonable, and if any of the companies are successful, that's a big bonus.",1316836865

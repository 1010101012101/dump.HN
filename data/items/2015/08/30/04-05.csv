10142294,comment,10141874,10142136,0,0,boken,,,"Zaner-Bloser, to my knowledge, is not so far off from Palmer except in its prescribed teaching style, as carried out over multiple years in a child&#x27;s schooling. The final product, that is, looks quite similar, and the techniques are not so far off from one another.<p>D&#x27;Nealian was one of the final blows to nibbed pens in the U.S., even wiping them out of most Catholic schools: it was ballpoint from then on, almost without question. With longhand in the workplace largely supplanted by typewriters (and soon by personal computers), the public at large moved toward writing implements that were &quot;easier to pick up.&quot; After all, few people have need for an instrument whose finickiness is made up for only by ease of use in <i>long</i> sittings. Ballpoints are among the easiest writing tools to care for; you basically keep them out of the wash. No ink refilling, no cleaning out converters between colors and brands of ink, no ink drying out after two weeks in the drawer, no worry of the dreaded &quot;baby bottom nib&quot; of new fountain pens. Buy a Bic, get on with life. There&#x27;s much to recommend them. If your writing is purely utilitarian and miscellaneous—lists, thank-you notes, reminders, memos, etc.—you probably don&#x27;t want to bother with anything more complicated.<p>As it was taught to me, D&#x27;Nealian seemed to be designed for easy entry, plain and simple. Many other methods tend to concentrate on <i>technique</i> early, quite apart from letter formation. In D&#x27;Nealian, students are taught the proper manner in which to hold a pen, but little else. And ballpoint pens don&#x27;t really allow for the old &quot;proper&quot; grips that are still often taught, as other commenters have touched on. You have to exert force downward onto the page to get a ballpoint to write, while the old, loose tripod grip that is still recommended was designed for nibs that only needed to glance the page. So D&#x27;Nealian is associated in the minds of many students with cramping exertion, and forcing the pen into practice.<p>Anyway, as soon as you can hold a pen, you start tracing and copying letters. You basically &quot;draw&quot; them; the letter is taught, not the movement. That&#x27;s about all I can remember.<p>I&#x27;m not in education, so my recommendation of one over another shouldn&#x27;t be sought. But I would easily believe that there were great things to say about a system that gets children writing as soon as possible. This is particularly true if the manner in which we make our letters by hand will have no bearing on our future prospects. Which, of course, it almost certainly won&#x27;t.<p>Personally, I think D&#x27;Nealian looks childish. And if you aren&#x27;t writing with a flowing <i>technique,</i> I see little point for joining all letters in a word. Not that cursive has always been written with streamlined, flowing, efficient, &quot;full-arm&quot; movement, as in the Palmer method and some of its relations. But from my point of view, why waste the extra ink or graphite needed to join letters just to encourage cramp?<p>I don&#x27;t think D&#x27;Nealian killed cursive; Palmer or similar methodologies, which are hellish to learn if you go by the book, would likely have done even worse. More or less everything that we deal with today is in manuscript, unless your apartment complex happens to have cursive lettering on its awning or something, in the hopes of looking nice. Or maybe if you&#x27;re digging through old relatives&#x27; things. So it&#x27;s natural for children not to care about it, and even resent the drills needed to learn it.<p>I think the argument that ballpoints <i>killed</i> cursive is naturally overstated. If ballpoints hadn&#x27;t become popular around the same time that typewriters did, there may well still be need of different writing implements and quick cursive in the workplace. But certainly ballpoints do make cursive <i>much</i> more difficult.",1440910683
10142293,comment,10139224,10141736,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;cited in my 2009 USENIX paper&quot;<p>Oh hell: didn&#x27;t realize I was talking to the inventor himself. Pleasant surprise. My poor memory might be getting mixed up here on timeline. Huge dissertation people kept giving me was 2012: didn&#x27;t realize you were trying to push this stuff far back as 2007. You may have been a bit ahead of some & problem I describe was working in reverse: your info not getting to them. ;) Additionally, DDE was the newer effort. The old one I tried to remember was this:<p><a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi04/tech/full_papers/levasseur/levasseur.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi04/tech/full_papers/...</a><p>This is the bell that rang in my ear when people were first telling me about how Rump Kernels let you reuse drivers. By 2006, a German paper at Dresden had similarly reused FreeBSD drivers for disks or something. The same team continued working to build all kinds of L4 stuff and I/O virtualization, resulting in DDE around 2010-2011 range. An advantage of DDE, which yours might have too (dissertation on my backlog), is that you can use just components needed for your driver&#x27;s needs. OKL4 used such tech in their &quot;microvisor&quot; platform with these results: native drivers on L4 kernel for minimal or security-focused deployment; minimal, device wrapper for Linux drivers for effeciency; use of drivers in a full VM; virtual stubs to any of this for clients. So, depending on the When, the What of your work might have benefited from any lessons learned during these projects or even communications with group members. If their existence/accomplishments had reached you.<p>So, that&#x27;s what was in my head. May have helped, may have not. Rather than evolution, your work sounds like independent re-invention of one capability and new invention in others. That happens, too, even in my own investigations. I got more confused as I just looked at the 2009 paper as it talks about a lot more than driver reuse. I was going to drop your example from my meme (or reverse it) but I might need to straight up read your book before I talk about the subject more. I think what a lot of people describe to me online about Rump Kernels and what your paper says are a bit different. Misinformation could&#x27;ve thrown off my opinion.<p>&quot;I do know that even my first [rejected] paper on rump kernels from 2007 stressed the idea of not forking.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a key advantage of your work and worth several different lines of research. Whether academics like it or not, it was a good idea. Good job focusing on that hard problem as few even tried.<p>&quot; I don&#x27;t know if me being ignorant is more embarrassing for myself or the general computing community.&quot;<p>It could be you or them, as I&#x27;ve written, but my meme about leveraging prior work is not about you being ignorant: it&#x27;s how our field tracks and leverages what we&#x27;ve learned. I know people think of what I think before me so I searched &quot;re-use device drivers&quot; back when idea came to me. Gave me 2004 paper. Many papers I&#x27;ve found have great &quot;related work&quot; sections with references that teach me plenty. Some were clearly a quick Google and summary that don&#x27;t reflect field&#x27;s accomplishments. So, culture of institution plays into it. Past that, the stuff is so spread out in so many Universities, conferences, ACM/IEEE, web articles, DEFCON&#x27;s, etc it&#x27;s nearly impossible to track it all unless one is obsessively dedicated like myself. ;) But the tradeoff was that I couldn&#x27;t be implementing in code as many of my ideas like you did, eh?<p>So, I think the issue here is that good ideas were brewing in several different places yet without a way to connect them and academia as a whole not really pushing for that. I keep trying to determine a solution but it&#x27;s tricky. Recurring concept is to have a non-profit collection (eg Citeseerx) of most of the stuff with tags (eg &quot;driver re-use&quot;) and good search functionality to encourage serendipity. Plus, a series of forums that only allow people doing research, coding things, other proven capabilities, or referrals by the same. Then, you see someone&#x27;s work, you can contact them directly or start a forum post related to their work that notifies them. Encourage conversations that work out hard problems or prevent wasteful re-work. Public can read them but not comment unless approved by moderation as useful. Goal is to keep quality at pro or aspiring pro level. Tricky to get this going, for sure, but I&#x27;m trying to work out the concept itself before worrying about popularity too much. Thoughts on this scheme or others?<p>&quot;Yes, I absolutely believe that drivers should be separate from the OS layer. Them being bundled together is a (pre)historic mistake. I agree that we would be in a much better place if projects like OSKit and DDEKit had gotten attention early on.&quot;<p>Basically my point. Again, not a gripe at you or Rump kernels: just how stuff stays obscure. Your original papers actually fit into that category now that we&#x27;ve talked about them. Least yours got out there and took off. Great work on both the tech and making it a success. :)",1440910668

As original posted the line had both &quot;linkbait&quot; and &quot;amateur hour&quot;. If I&#x27;d been sitting at a keyboard rather than touch screen, I might have have written something more constructive. The rhythm is better, editing is easier, and input is not so painful that I am looking for an ending after a couple of paragraphs.<p>Objectively speaking, there is pretty strong evidence to support a belief that a &quot;Windows bashing meme&quot; exists to the extent that any meme can exist. Apple spent most of a decade and several billion dollars on buying over the air advertising for it&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a PC campaign&quot;; it&#x27;s so socially acceptable to bash Windows that PG hisself engaged in it for many years; and a lynchpin of Silicon Valley mythology is NetScape got hosed even though it unicorn exited at about $10 Billion, Marc Andreesen&#x27;s minority stake was enough to make him a VC and Jim Clark bought a gridiron football field length yacht.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m opposed to over-enthusiastic headlines, well written headlines should capture the reader&#x27;s attention to the point that they click. What makes it &quot;linkbait&quot; to me is that it panders toward confirmation bias rather than encouraging curiosity: it&#x27;s us-versus-them tech gossip of the sort that tends not to make people smarter. I often wonder about unicorns not seen because of YC&#x27;s historical attitude toward Windows [e.g. the days when a tock processor announcement for the mid-year Macbook dominated the HN frontpage for a day or two].<p>As to the other topic, one form low quality HN comments [1] take is what I call &quot;the internet pick apart&quot;. Break a post down into many sound-bites. Cast each into an unfavorable context. Then arbitrarily argue against each sound bite. The goal is to broaden the flame war across many fronts without creating a concentrated target for coherent rebuttal. The pattern is to apply it recursively to each of successive defence by the victim. The sport is to keep the target spinning [there are extra points for reintroducing sound-bites from higher in the thread].<p>That said, a comment that literally begins with the string &quot;The problem with you&quot; probably isn&#x27;t intended to produce constructive dialog. Pig lipsticking it with &quot;r argument&quot; doesn&#x27;t change the purpose. Credit where credit is due, at least the comment works its way up to the pick apart rather than down to the problem with me.<p>Anyway, whenever I find myself writing or saying &quot;you&quot; in  a conversation I try to stop and try to rephrase. It&#x27;s loaded. When I read comments that use &quot;you&quot; it&#x27;s usually the rest of the internet seeping into HN. The exception is things like &quot;You can safely assume that I didn&#x27;t write this on mobile.&quot;<p>[1]: On the other hand, the internet pick apart and other forms of flaming and trolling and pointless arguing constitute some of the highest quality writing on the internet in general. Trolling and flaming are successful because they are writing for an audience and for entertainment and for the shear joy of writing...or at least it was for me.",1440909551

The recent study which reported a reproducibility in sociology of about 36% strikes me as pretty accurate.<p>I think the scientific system can work with that. It means that if you build follow-up experiments based on a single paper there is a good chance that the experiment fails.

On a second, closer read, I realized that it was actually a design issue. The default text was chosen to be grey, and the link text color to be dark blue-grey. Essentially, links are indistinguishable from the text they are interspersed with. If you click the link and jump to it when you see it in the first paragraph, you&#x27;ll find further details. &quot;As you know, Stefan H from Ericson R&D, and Chair of the webrtc working group @ w3c and myself have been instrumental in starting the <i>webrtc in webkit initiative</i>[THAT WAS THE LINK!].&quot;<p>...it gives you this:<p>&quot;WebRTC is a set of browser APIs and protocols being worked on by the W3C and IETF standardization bodies. With WebRTC, developers can quickly add real-time peer-2-peer audio, video and data capabilities to their web applications through a set of standardised JavaScript APIs.<p>WebKit today lacks support for this exciting new standard. Our intention is to add WebRTC support to WebKit, starting with the WebKit GTK+ port (Linux), by means of the OpenWebRTC implementation. Much of the WebRTC support will be implemented in the core of WebKit and therefore shared among all WebKit ports. This will also enable integration of other WebRTC backends such as webrtc.org.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.webrtcinwebkit.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webrtcinwebkit.org</a><p>It would have been nice if that had just been summarized and added into the post though.

Yes, the US market is large and important, but it&#x27;s not the only one.<p>This is why things are done in firmware, so the factory can configure particular runs of boards for legal sale in whatever country they&#x27;re attempting to manufacture to sell in that day. Now, for the sake of it being cheaper, many devices may have just one big firmware blob: this is more common in devices like wifi routers than other things (e.g. cell phones).<p>I <i>am</i> a researcher in RF-related technology: my personal views are that the radio firmware should be kept separate from the rest of the software running on the device (fairly similar to what many phones do with a separate baseband), with the ability to upgrade the radio bits being restricted to a) the manufacturer and b) users that the FCC has approved to make such modifications -- this would provide a sane way to certify groups who can make these changes, both for research purposes and for the OEMs that are integrating the RF capabilities into some larger consumer device.<p>In addition, there&#x27;s many times where we&#x27;ve purchased hardware and performed modifications in-house to the control software, specifically because we DO have a license from the FCC to do things outside of what would be allowed for normal consumers. Forcing special hardware runs for things that aren&#x27;t locked down and can be used by the couple hundred groups (if that) in the country who do this sort of thing is going to be even more prohibitively expensive.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m extremely aware of the thought processes that would lead manufacturers to lock everything down if they&#x27;re forced to lock anything down, and this could be mostly worked around by making the manufacturer of the RF hardware (who typically isn&#x27;t the company selling you a device) responsible for those protections. They won&#x27;t have any desire or ability to touch the other parts of a device, so they won&#x27;t really be technically able to lock them down in the best case scenario. This gives a lot of freedom for the higher-level software to be kept in a state where it&#x27;s easy for users to modify.",1440907439

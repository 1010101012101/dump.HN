Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you that gluten is harming you in some way that&#x27;s so far not supported by any science, or that you should avoid it for the purpose of general wellness.

If you don&#x27;t believe me, try pleading ignorance of the law when you&#x27;re arrested for breaching a traffic regulation. It&#x27;s your responsibility to know the criminal law - however impractical that might be.<p>There is a bit of leeway on the boundaries between mistake of law and mistake of fact -- e.g. in England, a tenant who destroyed something he&#x27;d installed himself, not knowing that under civil law it&#x27;d become the landlord&#x27;s property, had his conviction for destruction of property quashed (R v Smith [1974] QB 354). And apparently in Canada there&#x27;s a defence of &quot;invincible mistake of law&quot; in situations where it&#x27;s literally impossible for the person charged with a crime to have known it was a crime at the time it was committed. But the general principle is that ignorance of the law is no defence to any crime, however &#x27;unnatural&#x27;.<p>IANAL.",1378648644

The flip side of selective enforcement to jerk someone around is being able to not punish someone whose conduct falls within the letter of the law, but who didn&#x27;t have criminal intent.<p>It&#x27;s this reason that I think the book &quot;3 felonies a day&quot; is very weak.

They don&#x27;t\ngive a procedure for the Koblitz curves, but they have far less design\nfreedom than the non-koblitz so I thought perhaps I&#x27;d stumble into it\nwith the &quot;most obvious&quot; procedure.<p>The deterministic procedure basically computes SHA1 on some seed and\nuses it to assign the parameters then checks the curve order, etc..\nwash rinse repeat.<p>Then I looked at the random seed values for the P-xxxr curves.

6348650,comment,6332385,6340155,2,0,MrFoof,,,"People buy Porsches for fun or track duty.  Some for both, in which I&#x27;m in the latter crowd.  I autocross my cars, and do DEs -- my current MX-5 has been on at least 13 different race courses in the country, including some of the very best (Watkins Glen, Mid-Ohio, Road Atlanta, Road America, Infineon, Laguna Seca, Sebring, VIR, Lime Rock).  It&#x27;s also my daily when I need to use a car to commute.<p>As for the Cayman S, it&#x27;s a damn serious car.  My load out hits 60 in 4.1-4.2s with launch control, and the 1/4 mile in around 12.6-12.7 @ 110mph (and 175mph in ~49 seconds).  A set of Michelin Pilot Super Sports will get it to hold around 1.1g of lateral grip (sustained, not peak).  You can&#x27;t go anywhere near its limits on public roads, except in a straight line.  If you want sideways fun, there&#x27;s the MX-5 and BRZ/FR-S for exactly that.<p>In a more powerful car (trust me, 325HP is still a lot in a 2900lb car!), DCTs give you a nice quick immediate jolt from the power surging in almost immediately.  It keeps a wonderful engine note (and boy does a Cayman S with sport exhaust make some noise) uninterrupted and always on boil.  Once Porsche changes its PDK shift levers to those like the GT3 (pull to upshift), those who want to think they&#x27;re in a racing car with a sequential box can.  If I could get PDK-S in a Cayman S, I would and would mostly use the shift lever.<p>I find most detractors of a good DCT haven&#x27;t driven a car with one.  Additionally, not all manuals are great to begin with, which can be frustrating when you&#x27;re trying to be quick.  The MX-5 is ridiculously good for what the car cost.  The Type 997 911 had a great 6-speed as well.  My Lancer Evolution VIII MR had an extremely heavy clutch, and I&#x27;d say the last few BMW M cars have had a heavier clutch than I&#x27;d prefer (and dev money was mostly spent on DCTs).  Corvette Z06s and Vipers (last drove a third gen/ZB) require a very deliberate use of the shift lever.",1378647636

When they knocked out the &quot;liking&quot; system, the rats would eat exactly as much of the food without making any of the satisifed lip-licking expression, and areas of the brain thought to be correlated with pleasure wouldn&#x27;t show up in the MRI. Knock out &quot;wanting&quot;, and the rats seem to enjoy the food as much when they get it but not be especially motivated to seek it out.</i>",1378647591

Or, should I say &quot;should be for&quot;?<p>I think there are two ways to get a critical mass of people to move a certain way: through a massive ad campaign, or through laws.<p>Unfortunately, both ways are not guaranteed to work. For instance, women&#x27;s rights were greatly improved in the 20th century through a massive campaign, the feminist movement. It lead to women&#x27;s right becoming a focal topic, in the media and then in society, and by raising awareness and being persistent, slowly things started improving. Today, however, my impression is that by and large women&#x27;s rights are on the decline again. Intuitively, it seems to me that if there&#x27;s someone with an agenda pushing against certain topics, such as for instance some global corporations against environmental actions, it becomes and arms race between those who benefit from the status quo and campaign members. If the latter fail to create a new status quo in a certain window of time, the campaign will eventually lose steam. Not that the topic will disappear completely, but it will be harder and harder to motivate others for the cause because the novelty has worn off.<p>Therefore if people cannot be convinced - and of course it&#x27;s always more comfortable for people not to have to change - an alternative could be to force changes by law. Again, if we look at environmental issues, a lot of improvements have been made that way, but how many more have been missed?<p>The goal of a politician is not to change, it is to be re-elected. So s/he has to be convinced that doing a certain thing will get her/him closer to that goal. Again, we&#x27;re looking at an arms race, this time it&#x27;s the lobbying race. The campaigning discussed above plays into that as well because if the public opinion can be influenced that will definitely be heard by politicians as well. It doesn&#x27;t automatically mean that the public&#x27;s will is going to be put into law, but the more pressure from outside the better.<p>I&#x27;ve given up trying to get people to even read up on environmental issues let alone change their behavior. And believe me, I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve given up because it&#x27;s too frustrating. I think people have to be forced (through laws), they won&#x27;t change by themselves.",1378645630

In my perfect world, the solution would be a template in a separate file:<p><pre><code>    <template name=&quot;mytemplate&quot;\n              args=&quot;strings: array[string]&quot;\n      <ul>\n        <li foreach=&quot;string in strings&quot;\n            content=&quot;string&quot;>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </template>\n</code></pre>\nand in the code you&#x27;d do this:<p><pre><code>    mytemplate.fill(strings);\n</code></pre>\nGenerating HTML is one of those tasks that really deserve a DSL ;-)<p>Also note that my solution doesn&#x27;t really follow your pattern of composing several operations. The template loops over the array only once instead of three times. Maybe that&#x27;s because it feels more natural to some people to nest several operations inside one loop, rather than pull out each operation as its own loop. I share that point of view as well, it feels weird to write a chunk of code differently depending on whether it&#x27;s inside a loop or outside a loop. YMMV.<p>Of course the functional approach also supports putting all operations inside one loop. You could build up the composite operation by using a lambda (which would look similar to your initial imperative example), or using some function composition operators (which I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy reading afterward).",1378645376

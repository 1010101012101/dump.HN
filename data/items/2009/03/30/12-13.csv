Affirmative action helped women for how long?<p>> As far as i'm aware, we still live in an unequal society. Men make more money than women. <p>You are confusing equal outcomes with equal opportunities. Let me give you a good example: in engineering there are plenty of bursaries available for women. Support for men in engineering pales into comparison with the support of women in engineering. Yet, a lot more men study engineering than women (and the gender gap is widening).<p>Can you say that there was not equal opportunity?<p>> Women are not anywhere close to being proportionally represented in government.<p>Again – they have equal voting rights. If they feel they have been mistreated they can vote for another party. There are several countries in the world (such as Germany) that have female presidents.",1238414715

It&#x27;s no secret their coffee is just meh in comparison to any other coffee shop. People frequent Starbucks because they love the brand. A lot of things comprise a brand. The logo, the music, the smell, the brown tiled floor, the atmosphere, and yes, the wifi they offer.<p>If Starbucks partners with Google it isn&#x27;t really a play to make the free-loaders more comfortable from an operations standpoint, it is about improving their brand image. Once you know they have faster wifi, it will be one more aspect of the brand that you are drawn to, even if it isn&#x27;t to use the wifi. It may sound absurd, but I believe this is more of a marketing play than actually improving the customer experience.",1375289989

I love Prolog and Haskell and use them all the time. My passion for them makes their thorns seem small and easily avoided, but the reality is that those thorns are sufficient to keep out a lot of curious people. I didn&#x27;t really figure out how to write a Prolog program that handled command line arguments until a month ago. Prior to that, I would just run Prolog, consult my script and run my function. Simple enough barrier, but one that would have kept most of my friends away.<p>I think you took my &quot;real X, Y, Z&quot; list as a literal insult, which isn&#x27;t what I meant. I don&#x27;t know Perl. I was just referencing the presentation, not trying to sling arrows at Moose or whatever.<p>I do think that providing multiple options where most languages have one option built-in is unnecessary cognitive load. One doesn&#x27;t &quot;choose&quot; an &quot;object system&quot; for Python--what benefit would one hope to gain? That the options are compatible is nice, but it&#x27;s indisputably more work for everyone than just having one.<p>Having what are essentially language built-ins elsewhere available instead on CPAN is worth complaining about, because if you&#x27;re going to do things differently from others, the difference should be motivated by something. That something in Perl is backwards compatibility and the desire to provide lots of options. The former is an explanation, not a rationale, and the latter implies, again, a cognitive cost. When you spend my attention and brain power, I had better get something in return. &quot;Options&quot; are only worth something if the alternatives are worth choosing between. In the case of OO, complete intercompatibility between them suggests the differences are minor; in that case, why have them?",1375289290

6135069,comment,6133816,6134779,16,0,derefr,,,"Let me first say, I agree with every individual statement you made, here.<p>However, let me put my argument another way: the ability to work with you to formalize your idea is <i>what you&#x27;re paying for</i> when you hire a programmer. You&#x27;re paying for a human compiler[1], a fully-intelligent REPL where you can give vague commands like &quot;make me the next Facebook&quot; and, through the programmer&#x27;s Engineering knowledge, they will ask you questions and force you to make choices, until they&#x27;ve turned that <i>informal</i> idea into an actual capital-S System. Inasmuch as they <i>have</i> that Engineering knowledge, the resulting System will be a formalization of your own desires. And <i>then</i>, having the formal System, the programmer can go and implement it. That part is comparatively trivial, and increasingly done &quot;by&quot; the software compiler. Victor is noble for driving us further toward trivializing that part of the process, but it <i>is</i> only part of the process.<p>But anyway, back to your points:<p>Most &quot;programmers&quot; <i>aren&#x27;t</i> programmers. If you&#x27;re only as good at programming as a member of the general population, then you don&#x27;t get a special job title, right? Otherwise, I would be right now a writer, actor, landscaper, game-designer, philosopher and life-coach, as well as a programmer. But in only one of those fields could I actually make more money than some schmoe who just decided to jump into the field last week, and the <i>reason</i> I&#x27;m &quot;more of a programmer&quot; than Bob-the-Accountant is a programmer, is that I can do the Engineering part better. If Bob-the-Accountant started calling himself a programmer, he&#x27;d be a <i>white belt</i> programmer--someone who just joined the Art, and must still <i>unlearn</i> their preconceived knowledge before they may begin--while my belt, at least, would have some color on it. Plenty of people calling themselves programmers are white-belts. That doesn&#x27;t mean we should consider them when we speak of &quot;the thing that programmers do.&quot; It would be like including people who write their own legal contracts when speaking about &quot;the thing that lawyers do.&quot;<p>So yes, if we&#x27;re going to keep using the word &quot;programmers&quot; to refer to both the Engineer journeymen <i>and</i> the white-belts who produce misfeasance with their every step, then we should stop putting &quot;programmers&quot; on a pedestal. After all, what use is a pedestal where the people on it are exactly as high up as the general population around them?<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6131742"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6131742</a>",1375289261

In simplest form, telecom signals are at a single wavelength; passing it through a &#x27;Dark side of the moon&#x27; prism will only deflect the beam, not split it.<p>When one refers to a beamsplitter, it&#x27;s usually a partially silvered mirror.<p><a href=""http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=914</a><p>If it&#x27;s fancy, it might use an evanescent wave to do the coupling, as in some cube beamsplitters.<p>Beamsplitters for optical fiber are more generally referred to as &#x27;couplers&#x27; and involve bringing two fiber cores close enough for a long enough distance that the probability of coupling light from one to the other is the desired amount.<p><a href=""http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=374"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=374</a><p>It is possible to split beams with a birefringent prism, but it is much less common.<p><a href=""http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=745"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=745</a>\n<a href=""http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thorlabs.us/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=917</a><p>Disclaimer for the following: I only work with optical fiber couplers occasionally, and not for telecom. Someone who works on telecom fibers daily will be more informed.<p>In summary, if someone wanted me to tap an optical fiber, I&#x27;d call up ThorLabs, get a matching coupler shipped overnight, cut the relevant fiber, slap APC ends on the fiber ends, and jack in. Splitting the beam in free space (outside of a fiber) with a prism is far more errorprone, unstable, and no more efficient. A fiber coupler has no moving parts, can&#x27;t break, and won&#x27;t take down a telecom&#x27;s trunk line if someone breathes on it funny.<p>If they&#x27;re actually using a prism, it&#x27;s because of some sort of impedance/reflection minimization scheme; I can&#x27;t conjure one that would work better than using simpler techniques though.",1375288381

Based on a novel approach we derive an explicit formula which characterises the optimal term as a function of a few key and, most importantly, empirically-estimable parameters. Using existing data on recordings and books we obtain a point estimate of around 15 years for optimal copyright term with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years. This is substantially shorter than any current copyright term and implies that existing terms are too long.&quot;<p>Additional information: <a href=""http://rufuspollock.org/2009/09/22/talk-at-atrip-conference-how-long-should-copyright-last/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rufuspollock.org/2009/09/22/talk-at-atrip-conference-...</a>",1375288206

Interestingly, that imitatates the game industries attempts to circumvent used games sales.<p>That highlights a deeper problem, there is a psychological divide between the IP and the plastic discs or dead tree they are placed upon. The authors wouldn&#x27;t care if you shared their book if whenever anyone but you (the purchaser of a license to the work) saw blank pages, but you can redistribute their information via traditional economic goods exchange and they don&#x27;t like that because in modern times copyright lets them lockdown distribution (for most people) all the time.<p>To answer your first question, here is the opposite perspective:<p>Throwing away copyright, why not let people freely exchange the information they have? You answer with &quot;the creator needs incentives to create and a means to eat&quot; but you could just switch to the patreon model - have per-work payments by your consumers directly. Then release your work, and let anyone else redistribute as if it were public domain.<p>Because inherently copyright says you don&#x27;t have rights to do what you want with the things you possess, if the thing is information, be it encoded in neurons in your brain, etched upon dead tree, engraved in a plastic platter, or stored in a large transistor grid. The codification that some intangible concept that can transcend medium is not yours to do what you want with - for every single copyrighted IP concept or work - is a limiter on the possessor for the benefit of the rights holder.<p>It is also important to differentiate the rights holder from the creator - since the vast majority of IP created today is not under the license of its creator but under the license of their employer. Which is why the life of author + 70 mess comes in, because huge corporations want never ending money for some work they spent finite time and effort making.<p>I&#x27;m a copyright abolitionist - I think the world would all around be a much better place if content creators pursued their own fans to pay their bills so they can create more. Given a sufficiently good earpiece to get the word out about new creators, and an easy way to discover them, it would be effectively a meritocracy of creative talent.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating theft - and it is important to remember what copyright <i>means</i> - this isn&#x27;t taking something from a content creator and passing it around nonchalantly. It is that when a content creator voluntarily gives you a copy of their work, that you can do whatever you want with it, including redistribute it yourself. If you break into someones house and steal their work in progress book they never finished, that is robbery. You are stealing their physical property containing their IP, and since that wasn&#x27;t a voluntary exchange of the initial information that is theft.",1375287445

6134776,comment,6129148,6134059,8,0,RogerL,,,"Perhaps. But I think he is a visual thinker (his website is littered with phrases like &quot;the programmer needs to <i>see</i>....&quot;. And that is a powerful component of thinking, to be sure. But, think about math. Plots and charts are sometimes extremely useful, and we can throw them up and interact with them in real time with tools like Mathcad. Its great. But, it only goes so far. I have to do math (filtering, calculus, signal processing) most every day at work. I have some Python scripts to visualize some stuff, but by and large I work symbolically because that is the abstraction that gives me the most leverage. Sure, I can take a continuous function that is plotted, and visually see the integral and derivative, and that can be a very useful thing. OTOH, if I want to design a filter, I need to design it with criteria in mind, solve equations and so on, not put an equation in a tool like mathcad, and tweek coefficients and terms until it looks right. Visual processing falls down for something like that.<p>Others have posted about the new IDEs that they are trying to create. Great! Bring them to us. If they work, we will use them. But I fundamentally disagree with the premise that visual is just flat out better. Absolutely, have the conversation, and push the boundaries. But to claim that people that say &quot;you know, symbolic math actually works better in most cases&quot; are resisting change (you didn&#x27;t say that so much as others) is silly. We are just stating facts.<p>Take your arabic numbers example. Roman numerals are what, essentially VISUAL!! III is 3. It&#x27;s a <i>horrible</i> way to do arithmetic. Or imagine a &#x27;visual calculator&#x27;, where you try to multiply 3*7 by stacking blocks or something. Just the kind of thing I might use to teach a third grader, but never, ever, something I am going to use to balance my checkbook or compute loads on bridge trusses. I&#x27;m imagining sliders to change the x and y, and the blocks rearranging themselves. Great teaching tool. A terrible way to do math because it is a very striking, but also very weak abstraction.<p>Take bridge trusses. Imagine a visual program that shows loads in colors - high forces are red, perhaps. A great tool, obviously. (we have such things, btw). But to design a bridge that way? Never. There is no intellectual scaffolding there (pun intended). I can make arbitrary configurations, look at how colors change and such, but engineering is multidimensional. What do the materials cost? How hard are they to get and transport? How many people will be needed to bolt this strut? How do the materials work in compression vs expansion? What are the effects of weather and age? What are the resonances. It&#x27;s a huge optimization problem that I&#x27;m not going to solve visually (though, again, visual will often help me conceptualize a specific element). That I am not thinking or working purely visually is not evidence that I am not being &quot;creative&quot; - I&#x27;m just choosing the correct abstraction for the job. Sometimes that is visual, sometimes not.<p>So, okay, the claim is that perhaps visual will/should be the next major abstraction in programming. I am skeptical, for all the reasons above - my current non-visual tools provide me a better abstraction in so many cases. Prove me wrong, and I will happily use your tool. But please don&#x27;t claim these things haven&#x27;t been thought of, or that we are being reactionary by pointing out the reasons we choose symbolic and textual abstractions over visual ones when we have the choice (I admit sometimes the choice isn&#x27;t there).",1375287035

6134766,comment,6134614,6134614,1,0,mindcrime,,,"I definitely have a take on this, as this gets to the heart of what our startup does.  Two of our products very specifically involve elements of &quot;how to share things in an office setting&quot;.<p>If you&#x27;ll indulge me a moment of what might be taken as self-promotion (it&#x27;s not really intended that way though), I&#x27;ll tell you about what out thing does, as a way of explaining some of my thinking on how a company can / should do this sort of thing.<p>For starters, we have a product, Neddick[1], which looks a lot like Reddit.  You can submit links, discuss those links, tag them, vote on them, and rank them by different criteria.  We support the notion of &quot;channels&quot; which is our equivalent to &quot;sub reddits&quot; in Reddit lingo.   But in addition to manual submission, we allow the configuration of <i>n</i> RSS feeds, and any given &quot;channel&quot; can aggregate 0..<i>n</i> feeds.  So if you wanted to, for example, define a &quot;marketing&quot; channel and point it all the popular marketing blogs, you could do that.  Or you could create a &quot;techies&quot; channel, point it at Hacker News, Techcrunch, GroovyBlogs.org, etc.  Whatever makes sense.<p>OK, so given a Reddit like thing, where we are starting to do some different stuff is here... we are implementing what we call &quot;triggers&quot; and &quot;filters&quot; to give a user more control over what happens with content in the system.  Filters let you filter a channel down to only those entries that match certain criteria (title keyword, body keyword, score, submitter, etc.).  Triggers are a similar notion, but they fire in reaction to events like &quot;new entry posted&quot;, &quot;entry tagged&quot;, &quot;entry voted on&quot;, etc., and allow users to hook an action to the event.  So you can arrange to, for example, have an entry emailed if it hits a certain score or receives a certain tag.<p>We also have an explicit &quot;share&quot; button that we attach to entries that allows you to share the entry via email, XMPP, or via a RESTful POST (in ActivityStrea.ms format) to a URL.  Right now we are focused on using that feature to allow users to &quot;share&quot; entries to our other product, Quoddy[2], which is an Enterprise Social Network.   As an ESN, it lets you do all the kinds of things you might imagine an ESN doing, and we&#x27;re working now on Semantic Web integration so we can do automatic content enrichment, etc.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m a big fan of technological tooling for sharing information and knowledge in an office setting.  Now, the kinds of things we&#x27;re building, I think, start to have the most value once an organization gets to a certain threshold of size/complexity (say, 500 employees or more).  A 10 person company might be able to get by with just an email list or something a lot simpler than our thing.    Honestly, we&#x27;re building mainly for bigger companies, as our ESN has SOA/ESB integration, BPM integration and a lot of &quot;enterprise&quot; stuff (which stands to reason, seeing as it&#x27;s an &quot;enterprise&quot; social network! :-) )<p>Obviously I think that information / knowledge sharing are important, or we wouldn&#x27;t be working on this stuff.  But here&#x27;s where it gets more interesting in my opinion... if all you do is share links, blurbs, whatever, you gain <i>some</i> value from that, but you don&#x27;t gain the maximum value from it.  You can email your office a link to a great article about, say, a new programming technique that you think should be adopted, or a new marketing approach, and it&#x27;s very easy for it to just disappear into the ether, for various reasons.   We think this kind of information sharing should have deeper hooks into how people actually get work done, and should support tooling to help A. keep things from getting lost, B. route just the right information to just the right people, and C. provide context to help support decision making.   That&#x27;s why we thing things like BPM and ESB integration are important to an ESN.. imagine if somebody shares a link to a document, and when you view it, you get pointers to open workflow User Tasks which are related to that document, or to recent business events which have some connection to that document.  Or, imagine if you have a button you can click that takes the link that got shared, and actually starts a workflow around it.<p>One thing about this stuff though... culture is huge.  Some companies are a good fit for this kind of stuff, and some aren&#x27;t.  Companies that are very &quot;flat&quot; organizationally, that promote empowered employees and widespread collaboration, will love this stuff.  Companies that are heavy on top-down, command & control hierarchy, that are very divisive politically, where knowledge hoarding is practiced, etc., won&#x27;t use this stuff even if you implement it.<p>Anyway, if you ever want to bat some ideas around offline, feel free to shoot me an email.  Information sharing / knowledge management / collaboration are kind of my passion, so I&#x27;m always interested in talking about this stuff.<p>[1]:  <a href=""https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fogbeam/Neddick</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/fogbeam/Quoddy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fogbeam/Quoddy</a>",1375286987

43985,comment,43608,43763,0,0,jey,,,"""<i>I think the more likely singularity is biological singularity, when individual human consciousnesses become immortal.</i>""<p>OK, why? Seems like we'd at least be able to get Strong AI by the crappy brute force way by reverse engineering a human brain before that. Your crappily reverse engineered human brain could then be used to design a proper Strong AI, and we're back to Strong AI being the key ingredient for a Singularity.<p>Why is it that you think developing a Strong AI is less likely than us being able to copy, accelerate, and immortalize a human brain?<p>""<i>A single human thinking about a problem for 10 million years should be able so solve pretty much anything.</i>""<p>What's the justification for this claim? Last I checked, humans brains have finite capacity and cannot recursively self-improve (in the sense of modifying their architecture and structure).",1187494034

Allow enterprenuers to develop cost effective solutions, while bootstrapping\n2. I guess, trust is generally built based on success stories. For Rich Internet Application, we do have good work with various startups. <p>What do you think, should be done to get use a better feel of service?",1187493640

43979,comment,43799,43799,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I did my PhD in comp sci because I absolutely loved solving CS problems and I wanted the respect a PhD brings. Yep, that second reason is as stupid as it sounds, but I couldn't really consider doing anything else until I'd climbed that mountain education put in front of me. If you can't stop yourself doing a PhD, then go ahead and do it quick. Its exactly as frustrating as this article makes out, and CS academia is as about as crap that unqualified rant made it sound a few days ago. <p>For the record I did my PhD in graphics, and while its a maths heavy field, so are so many others, it really depends on what kind of maths you're into.",1187493189

We don't have a lot of time in starting our companies, but I guess this is good because while you guys are being distracted by all this, I'll have read the important links and maybe make some breakthrough in my ""killer app"".",1187492697

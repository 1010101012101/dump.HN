Neither up nor down.<p>You can't dumb down Hebrew, it is already a very young language.  And you can't extend it up to the modern world or complex concepts because of the Biblical Hebrew heritage, with stiff grammar and way-ambiguous writing system.<p>You'll have to reinvent it to use it, and good luck with that.<p>I also speak Russian, proper and street.  When I have to.  
So much for that.<p>In my view they are all technical obstacles on the way of greater proliferation of ideas.  
Choose one language, whatever it will be.  English's fine.  
Use it for everything that involves technical concepts.  This is what most of the world today does, more or less, and it works out not that bad.<p>I'm not entirely sold on programming languages resembling human languages, but that's another matter altogether.",1237593249

525785,comment,524715,525379,0,0,njharman,,,"> No matter what happens in your page flow, you still need to return a HttpRequest object at the end of the day.<p>I think you mean HttpResponse object.  We must use Django differently (Do you use templates and contexts?) I don't understand what you are saying in your bafflement paragraph.  And your evaluation of good for simple but not for heavy lifting is the exact opposite of mine.  I love Django cause it makes the simple, simple and and the hard, possible.<p>Each view function takes a Request + parameters and returns a Response.  Simple, consistent, and flexible.  Easy to write decorators.  Easy to reuse view functions, easy to compose view functions from parts.  Easy to ditch the whole thing and roll your own.<p>Django is extremely well decoupled.  It comes with all sorts of batteries included but it's very easy to take out a battery and use your own.  Templates, storage, url routing are all easily replaced.  Apps can come and go, middleware can come and go.  And most the functionality admin/auth/caching/templates/storage backend/sessions/etc are split out into apps and/or middleware so it's easy to replace/extend if you need to do something special.  Recent releases have made even made the admin much easier to customize without wholesale replacement.<p>I've even used Django for non web apps.  I didn't have to do anything particularly special.  It just worked.<p>P.S. If you think ""media""/newspaper sites are simple, you don't know newspaper sites.",1237593125

Any project that wants to be cross-platform has this issue.<p>That's why there are also already solutions, for example buildbot. You can get it to check for new revisions in your VCS and run it on any platform. This is happening all over the world, using different systems (OS X, Windows, Linux, *BSD) with different versions of the OS and different compilers (GCC 4.2 GCC 3.4, Visual C++ etc).<p>Yes, if you want to be compatible, you'll have to do a little effort, but Javascript suites are hardly the first to figure this out.

2209940,comment,2209382,2209697,0,0,stcredzero,,,"I wonder if Nokia is in a position to blur the lines between smart phones and feature phones?  This could be done <i>with only a moderate increase</i> in the resources in each phone.  The hard part would be establishing the software ecosystem and getting the carriers to follow.<p>As pointed out elsewhere in these comments, Nokia has a huge chunk of market in the rest of the world.  If they could blur the lines between smart phone and feature phones, they could easily disrupt the smartphone market in developing markets, before it can even come to being.  Think about it, people in Africa are using SMS services the way we use Apps.  Even though this is uglier, it works great in their situation, because the vehicle fits the terrain much better.<p>The time lag between the developed world and the developing world is like having a telescope that can look into the future.  If Nokia can't capitalize on their position and this kind of foresight, then it's a damn shame.  (My money is that someone in India and/or China will see the same opportunity and disrupt all of Apple/Android/WP7/Blackberry/Nokia in this way.)",1297515462

And let me tell you, motivation and perseverance ARE something that can be taught. I blame:<p>* my laziness - learned through earlier education<p>* overcompensating for childhood social awkwardness by focusing on parties and social interaction with people who's only common interests are music, alcohol and the opposite sex<p>* lack of a clear goal (no alumni visits that show us what we can achieve if we put effort in activities A, B, C and so on),<p>* an easy enough study load that I could maintain high grades, in addition to a general lack of competitiveness in the class<p>* lack of study groups, which are instrumental in boosting interest in certain less-than-fascinating subjects.<p>A few key points for current students, or ""if I could go 4 years back in time"":<p>* balance your social circle. If you're in ICT/CS or related, don't hang out exclusively with the potheads that play PS2 games 24/7. Establish and maintain contacts with people who follow their interests in their spare time - that guy who's learning functional programming on the side, kids that are already freelancing or getting a part-time job in the field you're studying for.<p>* actively seek out older or already-graduated students. Don't procrastinate on doing your own case studies on who-went-where, what each skill you're studying will bring you and what are the key tips you can get from people you strive to be. Basically, get some role models and a mentor. It ain't easy, but the gains that you receive are worth the effort.<p>* do the research on all the factors that influence your mood and energy levels. Exercise, nutrition, social environment, etc. Optimize those, so you can be the person you want to be - high energy levels, motivation, ability to get things done and so on. That way you can avoid situations like falling into depression because ""I'll just minimize social contacts, so I can focus on catching up with that internship"" and subsequently fucking up the most crucial part of your education.<p>* knowledge is one thing, being able to put it into practice is the real skill. Knowing ""something"" about FP, embedded programming, security, general startup theory, freelancing and so on will mean nothing, if you can't put in the focus and dedication to actually get that first Django site, Android app, GAE site or whatever, running. Escapist information binging may bring in some useful knowledge, but without execution skills it all boils down to a ""Mr. Know-it-all"" cynical attitude with no real accomplishments. So start that first tutorial (even if you think you know all the stuff and you're too smart for it), and have something running.<p>That rant came out rather long, but being stuck in the final year of my bachelor's, not even having a github account, blog, twitter or reputation, being too low on self-esteem (""I have no marketable skills"") to break the anxiety barrier of applying for a mandatory graduation internship, I hope at least one student won't (through inaction) make the same mistakes I did.<p>[EDIT] Proofreading, minor tweaks.",1297512696

While MeeGo is quite close to your standard ""Linux on the Desktop"" (Sorry, was hard to resist), Google suffered from a lot of NIH based design decisions.\nOn the other hand they probably chose the easier route for themselves (instead of solving their problems in a codebase that's outside of their control) by creating things from scratch although ""standard"" alternatives were available.<p>In short: I'd say it probably _is_ hard and I'd even go so far as to say that MeeGo moving into Android would be pointless.<p>For code and effort sharing maemo/MeeGo was the better stack.",1297512232

(exact wording from some old draft of C++0x I have here) with C explicitly noting that ""What constitutes an access to an object that has volatile-qualified type is implementation-defined."" (ISO 9899 6.7.3.6). So there is not many to say about what volatile means without knowing exact implementation (and implementation should document what volatile exactly means).<p>I don't see what Microsoft could do to unilaterally change meaning of something that is almost completely implementation-defined.",1297512211

Mobile phones differ radically in speed, screen, memory, bandwidth, input-method, and so on, to produce a single app that runs everywhere well is a tall order, even if the APIs were identical. J2ME was a nice try, but the profiles themselves created fragmentation. Android devices are fragmented in a smaller way by contrast, first, the bar for performance minimum and OS features are set way higher. Secondly, there's no profiles<p>> This was very true in the mobile world a decade ago and was a huge driver of fragmentation; but with todays dramatically more powerful handsets, and especially given the concentration on high-end handsets, there's no reason for any fragmentation.<p>Hrm.  He seems to be forgetting how many non-super-fancy-high-end phones there are out there.  Ironically, those phones are one reason to keep using Java ME.",1282687017

(Not inevitable--there may indeed be unsurpassable barriers to any kind of intelligence. I'm talking about logical barriers like Gödel's incompleteness theorem, or the possibility that P != NP.)

It's like saying that some people are sick of paying $20k for their cars and predicting that Apple is going to design a better car (tangent: wouldn't that be nice?) and sell it for just $1k. Sounds great, but it's just not possible.<p>Contrary to popular belief, not <i>all</i> of that $150 you give to Comcast each month (ouch) goes to buying yachts for Comcast's CEO. Some of it goes to building and maintaining a network. Some of it even goes to pay for the production of those movies and television shows you're watching. The costs of producing entertainment and running large-scale networks is probably not going to drop by 90% any time soon.<p>The more likely scenario is this:<p>Comcast: May I help you?<p>Me: Yes, I'd like to cancel my $150/month TV+internet package and just get an internet-only package because I can get all the content I want over the internet now much more affordably.<p>Comcast: OK, no problem. Our internet-only packages run $145/month.<p>I still think this is a huge improvement, mind you. Having everything on demand is much better than worrying about TV networks' schedules. And those who watch less can now pay less (i.e. those who watch more can pay more...). I just don't see everyone's bill going from $1,500 a year to $100 a year, like the article suggests.",1282686552

Because the hyperbolic metric Einstein created allows us to define how much space-time can change the amount of mass(and vice versa!). And this only works <i>if</i> the speed of light is constant—that's actually the God-like conceptual leap Einstein took when realizing the Michelson-Morley experiment implied much bigger things about space, time, mass and gravity, and not just mere light speed.<p>Also, it keeps several other super-important constraints in place too. That's the problem with gravity—it's more like an infinite Jenga puzzle and anything you add to the explanation must not contradict dozens of other old physics experiments about things having nothing to do with gravity. We can't throw out all the other stuff we do know after all. Like the constancy of the speed of light in any reference frame. And the conservation of energy.
And Maxwell's electrodynamic equations. And a bunch of other specific experiments I don't even know much about.<p>I don't know how much of thermodynamics has been ""relativized"", but gravity can't contradict the laws of thermodynamics either. It's actually comforting that the world of thermodynamics is so tiny, cold, deals with such a large number of ""particles""(ensembles), and is built from insanely complex mathematical machinery that we probably have no hope of ever devising an experiment that could say anything meaningful about gravity in terms of thermodynamics. (I so hope that I'm very wrong here.)<p>However, Gravity is famously in contradiction with Quantum Mechanics, though I haven't yet progressed far enough in either to be able to say specifically what the contradiction is. I suspect it's just the lack of a math ""bridge"" between Relativity, which is built up from calculus, differential forms, tensors, Rienmannian geometry, the calculus of variations and weird ways QM uses linear algebra, eigenvalues, infinite bounded operators and insane algebraic concepts like von Neumann algebras to setup infinite matrices of probabilities that map back to the periodic, bounded solutions of the Schrödinger wave equation that tell us what the energy levels of some physics experiment must be.<p>Oh and the model of gravity has to be able to fit in well with any new stuff we discover too. <i>Being able to pull off all of that is why I place Einstein in the pantheon of geniuses!</i> He's kind of like a one-armed man who holds off an entire army of swordsmen using only a pocket knife.",1282685067

All you had to do is fix them, and resubmit (each submit to the manifacturer costs some money).<p>Violations are usually user interface problems - not handling correctly if a game controller was pulled, or Disk I/O error happened, or network was disconnected. Some are strict (for example you should have something on the screen no less than N seconds once the disc is put in), some are suggestions for better integration with the system.<p>You should also display how big your save games would be :) (Not sure if this is still requirment everywhere), but it used to be for PS1/PS2.<p>As for RAM - well I guess when the console was first produced, RAM costs were really high. I'm not a hardware guy, but eventually the manifacturers are squeezing that expensive console to produce to something very cheap, and having less memory makes it easier. Just a guess. Not much knowledge in this area.<p>But having only 256MB of RAM is not that bad - we often don't use malloc/free new/delete, or have them working on specific memory blocks (for example to keep recent cache of collisions), and usually allocated with the same sizes.<p>Not having much RAM means you have to be more inventive - you can find savings different ways - streaming, layering, or other techniques. ID's recent tech is just awesome in that respect.<p>Although I've told you that we have different compile options, the HW stays the same :) This is both good & bad - good that you can become really expert in it, bad because by the time you are - next console arrives.<p>Usually that's why the first game suck, and games released 2nd or 3rd year are just awesome, and the last ones released might be better than first ones released for the next generation - God Of War for PS2 was such example. There was nothing that good on the PS3 at that time from the same genre.<p>Metal Gear Solid for PS1 also shaked up the graphics quality. It's still an awesome looking game even for PS1. And this was on 2MB of memory, 512kb video (or was it less or little more), and I can't remmember now well 256kb or 512kb audio.<p>I worked on the port of MGS to PC (mgspc.com), and was amazed of how good the japanese coders were, and the way the music was composed - it was midi/mod like but really really well done (we lied on the PC and released it as .wav file - no mixing).<p>What I'm saying here, is that if you have little digital samples and some notes/tracks you can compose music pieces that otherwise would take you megabytes of memory (APDCM compression was just 1:4 with low quality, unlike 1:10 or more for mp3 and others).",1282684090

<i>As a sidenote, this difference of experience highlights a big problem with rich web applications.<p>You get so high variance in performance depending on a particular combination of hardware, OS and browser that you are virtually predestined to fail hard for some non-negligible part of your userbase (unless your application is so trivial that even on the worst possible platform it would still work ok).<p>I know, this problem existed with classical games all the time.

Men have always been prey to distractions, which are the original sin of the mind; but never before today has an attempt been made to organize and exploit distractions, to make of them, because of their economic importance, the core and vital center of human life, to idealize them as the highest manifestations of mental activity. Ours is an age of systematized irrelevancies, and the imbecile within us has become one of the Titans, upon whose shoulders rests the weight of the social and economic system.

I&#x27;m actually unclear what exactly this is a decision tree for because its steps are so subjective.<p>Definitely isn&#x27;t the decision tree from first contact to investment - that would be much deeper. It would also have to factor in how much heat there is behind the deal already - which for most seed firms is probably the most important signal! Seems accurate as a decision tree to take a meeting with someone though.<p>As an exercise, try running some of their portfolio companies through that decision tree and see what kind of results you get.",1386579431

The website previously contained this:<p>:Reform Government Surveillance<p>:Global Government Surveillance Reform<p>The undersigned companies believe that it is time for the world’s governments to address the practices and laws regulating government surveillance of individuals and access to their information.<p>While the undersigned companies understand that governments need to take action to protect their citizens’ safety and security, we strongly believe that current laws and practices need to be reformed.<p>Consistent with established global norms of free expression and privacy and with the goals of ensuring that government law enforcement and intelligence efforts are rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to oversight, we hereby call on governments to endorse the following principles and enact reforms that would put these principles into action.<p>:The Principles<p>:1 Limiting Governments’ Authority to Collect Users’ Information<p>Governments should codify sensible limitations on their ability to compel service providers to disclose user data that balance their need for the data in limited circumstances, users’ reasonable privacy interests, and the impact on trust in the Internet. In addition, governments should limit surveillance to specific, known users for lawful purposes, and should not undertake bulk data collection of Internet communications.<p>:2 Oversight and Accountability<p>Intelligence agencies seeking to collect or compel the production of information should do so under a clear legal framework in which executive powers are subject to strong checks and balances. Reviewing courts should be independent and include an adversarial process, and governments should allow important rulings of law to be made public in a timely manner so that the courts are accountable to an informed citizenry.<p>:3 Transparency About Government Demands<p>Transparency is essential to a debate over governments’ surveillance powers and the scope of programs that are administered under those powers. Governments should allow companies to publish the number and nature of government demands for user information. In addition, governments should also promptly disclose this data publicly.<p>:4 Respecting the Free Flow of Information<p>The ability of data to flow or be accessed across borders is essential to a robust 21st century global economy. Governments should permit the transfer of data and should not inhibit access by companies or individuals to lawfully available information that is stored outside of the country. Governments should not require service providers to locate infrastructure within a country’s borders or operate locally.<p>:5 Avoiding Conflicts Among Governments<p>In order to avoid conflicting laws, there should be a robust, principled, and transparent framework to govern lawful requests for data across jurisdictions, such as improved mutual legal assistance treaty — or “MLAT” — processes. Where the laws of one jurisdiction conflict with the laws of another, it is incumbent upon governments to work together to resolve the conflict.<p>:Voices For Reform<p>“AOL is committed to preserving the privacy of our customers’ information, while respecting the right of governments to request information on specific users for lawful purposes. AOL is proud to unite with other leading Internet companies to advocate on behalf of our consumers.” —Tim Armstrong, Chairman and CEO, AOL<p>“Reports about government surveillance have shown there is a real need for greater disclosure and new limits on how governments collect information. The US government should take this opportunity to lead this reform effort and make things right.” —Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook<p>“The security of users’ data is critical, which is why we’ve invested so much in encryption and fight for transparency around government requests for information. This is undermined by the apparent wholesale collection of data, in secret and without independent oversight, by many governments around the world. It’s time for reform and we urge the US government to lead the way.” —Larry Page, CEO, Google<p>“These principles embody LinkedIn’s fundamental commitment to transparency and ensuring appropriate government practices that are respectful of our members’ expectations.” —Erika Rottenberg, General Counsel, LinkedIn [when LinkedIn criticizes your privacy policy you know something&#x27;s wrong]<p>“People won’t use technology they don’t trust. Governments have put this trust at risk, and governments need to help restore it.” —Brad Smith, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Microsoft<p>“Twitter is committed to defending and protecting the voice of our users. Unchecked, undisclosed government surveillance inhibits the free flow of information and restricts their voice. The principles we advance today would reform the current system to appropriately balance the needs of security and privacy while safeguarding the essential human right of free expression.” —Dick Costolo, CEO, Twitter<p>“Protecting the privacy of our users is incredibly important to Yahoo. Recent revelations about government surveillance activities have shaken the trust of our users, and it is time for the United States government to act to restore the confidence of citizens around the world. Today we join our colleagues in the tech industry calling on the United States Congress to change surveillance laws in order to ensure transparency and accountability for government actions.” —Marissa Mayer, CEO, Yahoo<p>:An open letter to Washington<p>Dear Mr. President and Members of Congress,<p>We understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens. But this summer’s revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide. The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual — rights that are enshrined in our Constitution. This undermines the freedoms we all cherish. It’s time for a change.<p>For our part, we are focused on keeping user’s data secure — deploying the latest encryption technology to prevent unauthorized surveillance on our networks and by pushing back on government requests to ensure that they are legal and reasonable in scope.<p>We urge the US to take the lead and make reforms that ensure that government surveillance efforts are clearly restricted by law, proportionate to the risks, transparent and subject to independent oversight.

You need to have your (implicit) computational model before you can start counting critical operations, whether you describe it or not.<p>This is actually somewhat important, since almost everyone has agreed on a model that, among other things, considers random access, multiplication, hashing, and even explicitly O(log log n) operations to take constant time. It&#x27;s one of the many reasons why people make incorrect proofs about P=?NP.<p><i>edit</i>: If you meant that the simplification abstracts away implementation details like 3n^2+42 vs 2n^2+n, you&#x27;re right, that&#x27;s valuable.

It allows you to send an HTTP response gradually, using a Python generator.  It&#x27;s useful when:<p>1) You cannot know the whole response at the time of the request (e.g. streaming news updates).\n2) It&#x27;s computationally expensive to calculate the whole response, and you don&#x27;t want to make the user wait and/or calculate something that ends up not being used (e.g. if the user cancels the request).\n3) You want to save bandwidth.  If I were streaming music to you, and allowed you to switch tracks whenever you wanted, then I might not want your browser to start downloading the entire track (faster-than-real-time) when you click play.  If I did, and you only listen to half-songs, then I would use twice as much bandwidth.

You&#x27;re only <i>making</i> a problem where none really exists. Complaining that the definitions of everyday words are unclear is just a bullshit distraction. If that were the case, we simply could not communicate at all.<p>>> Actually I value pragmatism and social utility well over consistency when it comes to my society.<p>Yes, well, now we&#x27;re in the territory of collectivist thinking, which is just completely ass-backwards considering we&#x27;re all just individuals, not part of The Borg. Collectivism is one of the supporting pillars of States. We&#x27;re bombarded with the idea that we must all be subject to a ruling class for the common good, that we need to pay taxes to help poor people, and so on.<p>And before you go there, wanting to keep your property does <i>not</i> mean you want poor people to die. You just want <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> property rights to be respected.<p>>> If a society is entirely rational based on a narrow vision of rational morality but ends up worse for the majority of people than one that is morally corrupt from top to bottom... well you&#x27;ll find me in Corruptopia.<p>In case you haven&#x27;t noticed, you already find yourself in Corruptopia. Seriously, dude. Bailouts ring a bell? Campaign contributions (=bribes), etc? You know your politicians are thoroughly corrupt and lie just about every time they open their mouths, and you insist on holding on to <i>that</i>?<p>>> But we should definitely aim for one that respects your morals (property rights) over anyone else&#x27;s (equal access to land, food etc) ?<p>Not &quot;over&quot; anyone else&#x27;s. Obviously, everyone has the exact same rights as everyone else. That means no one is allowed to take my property, and I&#x27;m not allowed to take anyone else&#x27;s property. It all works out just fine. Oh, and rights can&#x27;t be in conflict - that would break our notion of rights. Just like black is black and <i>not</i> white at the same time, the right to <i>take</i> someone&#x27;s property cannot exist while people have the right to <i>keep</i> their property. Get it?<p>>> Yup, in some circumstances. For instance if your property is radioactive and near my house. There are many other exceptions as you yourself have mentioned.<p>The obvious answer was &quot;no&quot;, and that&#x27;s enough. We&#x27;re not talking about edge cases here, because there are countless, and wading through them is pointless. There are even more circumstances where it takes zero effort to adhere to the NAP.<p>Here&#x27;s a good rule of thumb: any time you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to aggress against anyone, you&#x27;ll <i>automatically</i> adhere to the NAP, and if you&#x27;re sane, you&#x27;ll realize that this is pretty much <i>all the time</i>. See, in reality, there is no problem with the NAP, even if no moral rule can &quot;cover&quot; <i>every possible situation ever</i>. That just can&#x27;t be required. As mentioned, the best we can do is &quot;close enough&quot;, and the NAP certainly is.<p>>> non-violent pacifists and never, ever punch someone in the face for saying something they don&#x27;t like about their girl (for instance).<p>Right, and what fucking sense does it make to physically assault someone for <i>saying</i> something bad about you <i>or</i> your girlfriend? Insecure much? Feeling violent?<p>>> I&#x27;m sorry, but you start with an ill-defined premise (the NAP), admit there are hundreds of holes or grey areas, and then try to tell us that we should build our entire moral outlook and society on it anyway. It&#x27;s rather funny really.<p>Dude. You haven&#x27;t got much to go by here. See above. You <i>know</i> that the NAP works just fine.<p>Besides, when you say <i>&quot;we should build our entire moral outlook and society on it&quot;</i>, who exactly is that <i>we</i> you refer to? What should <i>we</i> do? What should <i>you</i> do? Who&#x27;s anyone to tell you what <i>you</i> should do, as long as you don&#x27;t harm others? You&#x27;re thinking in collectivist terms again, which is understandable, since we&#x27;ve all been brainwashed to think like that. But you need to wake up and realize that we&#x27;re not The Borg. We&#x27;re not parts of some collective consciousness. We&#x27;re all just individuals, and make our individual choices. Choices have consequences, and everyone is responsible for his own.",1386576520

This is risible. Who voted for Edward Snowden?<p>What he has done is not confined to &quot;whistleblowing&quot;, if indeed any of it is. He apparently stole massive amounts of classified information, much of it on programs that by any reasonable definition are legitimate, albeit potentially embarrassing. He&#x27;s now flying around from one U.S. strategic competitor to another, apparently unconcerned that what he stole could end up in the hands of those who do not wish the U.S. well.

The fact that there may be a dynamically linked version of L2 elsewhere on the system is irrelevant.</i><p>No, it&#x27;s highly relevant because when a security fix lands for L2, it takes longer to propagate to users if projects like P bundle their own versions of L2 as part of their releases.  In that case, users must wait for the <i>project developers</i> to work the already-released L2 fixes into their own bundled versions of L2 and then release new versions of <i>the projects</i> before any downstream users get the fix.  But if P and other projects use the same version of L2 that everybody else does, <i>everybody gets the fix right away</i>.<p>> <i>If the authors of L2 release a new version that P and Q are happy with, but creates an extremely subtle segfault condition in R, then what? ...</i><p>> <i>The packager could silently curse the author of R for not statically linking the necessary frozen-in-time version of L2 and thus bypassing this problem entirely.</i><p>More likely, the packager would patch L2 to fix the problem with R and then <i>talk to</i> the upsteam L2 developers to get the patch included in L2 proper.  This way, R&#x27;s users get the fix right away <i>and</i> the problem gets eliminated at its source, in L2, rather than papered-over in R&#x27;s private copy of L2.<p>As I wrote in my original post, one of the big benefits of the &quot;no bundling&quot; policy is to make sure that patches flow upsteam to where they belong instead of piling up in downstream repos where they do good for only one dependent project instead of all dependent projects.",1372020954

What Kennedy meant was that if this wasn&#x27;t an isolated incident and was in-fact becoming a common side effect of police procedure, then the legal system would have to start reevaluating how strict it will be with such violations.<p>Relevant paragraphs:<p><i>Today&#x27;s decision does not address any demonstrated pattern of knock-and-announce violations. If a widespread pattern of violations were shown, and particularly if those violations were committed against persons who lacked the means or voice to mount an effective protest, there would be reason for grave concern. Even then, however, the Court would have to acknowledge that extending the remedy of exclusion to all the evidence seized following a knock-and-announce violation would mean revising the requirement of causation that limits our discretion in applying the exclusionary rule. That type of extension also would have significant practical implications, adding to the list of issues requiring resolution at the criminal trial questions such as whether police officers entered a home after waiting 10 seconds or 20.<p>In this case the relevant evidence was discovered not because of a failure to knock-and-announce, but because of a subsequent search pursuant to a lawful warrant. The Court in my view is correct to hold that suppression was not required. While I am not convinced that Segura v. United States, 468 U. S. 796 (1984), and New York v. Harris, 495 U. S. 14 (1990), have as much relevance here as Justice Scalia appears to conclude, the Court&#x27;s holding is fully supported by Parts I through III of its opinion.

We came from nyc and were astounded how bad muni is.  Two people who very happily lived without cars were forced to buy one then two cars to live an adult life in sf.  How are you supposed to get groceries, run errands, go to the gym, go to the library, etc etc on muni when every errand costs an additional 60 to 90 minutes because of muni.  When we lived in Haight, we could bloody <i>walk</i> many places in the city faster than muni could take you there.  Taxis, even to valencia at 23rd, just don&#x27;t come.  And muni is not only glacially slow [2], but it&#x27;s fucking expensive as hell too:<p><pre><code>   For every mile Muni runs a bus in this city, it spends 9.21; comparable 
   agencies nationwide pay between 0 and 3. For every mile Muni runs a 
   light-rail vehicle, it throws down 4.37; comparable rail services spend 
   between 2 and 2. [1]
</code></pre>
So -- we pay the most and get the worst services.  Plus, I&#x27;ve ridden public transport all over the world and never before sf had I regularly felt physically unsafe on public transport.<p>And the housing.  Walk through the mission; while there&#x27;s definitely beautiful victorians there&#x27;s also a bunch of cheap shit, no more than two stories, thrown together for as little money as humanly possible in the 60s and 70s that we could tear down and replace with 10 story housing.  And landlords are fucking amazing; we ended up in court with multiple lawyers because, for the low low price of $2200/mo, we expected the shower not to leak into our bed and the landlord not to steal electricity from our meter.  When we lived in manhattan, people had landlord problems, but it wasn&#x27;t par for the course.  Here, amongst personal friends, roughly 40% have had just horrific landlord problems that ended up with police or court involvement.<p>And the schools.  There&#x27;s a reason parents are driven out; it&#x27;s because you either pay for private school or move to the peninsula and get good public schools for your taxes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-04-14/news/the-muni-death-spiral/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-04-14/news/the-muni-death-spira...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/us/san-francisco-buses-are-slow-but-just-try-eliminating-a-stop.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/us/san-francisco-buses-are...</a>",1372018919

We need to overcome atomization and rediscover solidarity instead of better skinner boxes, and that may take more than a generation even.

If it is something that can be explained to someone without all of attention span, intellectual honesty and passion, it is not worth a second thought.<p>And in a process that involves all people on the planet, I would not ever hold my breath to ever have a full explanation of the full picture, or expect a full map before I even do one step.

This leads to incredibly insecure people, who go insane as soon as the jukebox who tells them who they are goes silent, which in turn leads to all sorts of nonsense. As Voltaire said, those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities. Oh, the irony of complaining about &quot;rhetoric&quot; and then expecting a &quot;solution, pronto&quot;.<p>My &quot;solution&quot; would be, hmmm, we all read and implement the writings of Erich Fromm and Marcus Aurelius, get to know ourselves, all 7 billion of us.

Would an influx of immigrants help?<p>It&#x27;s not like every place is like the US (a vast country with room to spare, composed by tons of different ethnicities, living on the land of the previous inhabitants, and with a powerful enough economy to assimilate a lot of immigrants). Not to mention: the US immigrants came to the place in ages of SLOW transportation and over a period of 400 years (with some ramping up in the 20th century). Nowadays, especially in Europe, immigration ramps up in a couple of decades or less. And, given the huge numbers, they don&#x27;t even need to be assimilated that much -- if you can work in a place with millions of fellow X-speaking immigrants, and easy access to websites, tv etc in your language, why bother to learn english or change your habits at all?<p>Consider a thought experiment: would the US be OK with an influx of 100, 200 or 300 million immigrants from islamic countries? Not terrorists, mind you. Just normal folks, that, nonetheless, would soon wish their practices and mindset be respected and reflected in laws (and, since they would be able to vote, it would be): from the right to beat their wives or persecute gays, to refusing education to their daughters? And even darker stuff like &quot;honour killings&quot; that would be sure to want to bring to their new country?<p>Now, 30% is a lot to be realistic. But if immigration was &quot;open to all&quot;, it wouldn&#x27;t be that far off. Especially since, in the US, almost 100% are immigrants anyway (just over the course of centuries, not over the course of a decade or so). There are places in Europe where the immigrant population rose to 10% or 20% in a course of a couple decades.",1372018076

They do cause damage and mayhem, however that is strictly localised unless the government overreacts and introduces draconian measures in a mistaken attempt to find terrorists under every rock.

Peter King, now so ferocious against terrorists) without relying on mass surveillance of the kind it is now engaged in, in partnership with the US. It&#x27;s not necessary to stop the attacks, only to survive them. Your question is like asking:  How can we stop the next war?<p>In fact the aims of terror are principally to provoke a government to introduce repressive measures and lash out, and in the process, damage itself and its credibility with citizens. I think the aims of Bin Laden were probably to induce terror, fear, and paranoia in the US, and unfortunately they have succeeded, probably beyond their wildest dreams. Huge amounts of money and numbers of lives have been squandered, and the only result has been a series of failed states half-way across the world, a casual disregard for the rule of law, and a growing surveillance state at home destroying the very ideas the US claims to represent.<p>It&#x27;s time for the US to recognise that expanding the architecture of surveillance and engaging in an eternal war against an ill-defined enemy is not going to make anyone safer, quite the reverse.",1372017616

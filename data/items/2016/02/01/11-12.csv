I agree the regulations are a maze if you want to maximize profits when it comes to taxes. I cannot agree you need that to run a healthy company; you do not. Following the base rules (which can be automated and we do) is fine; sure you pay too much compared to navigating the maze but it is clear. The worst countries (paperwork wise) I operate in are Spain and Portugal but even there things can be simple if you overpay a bit (like sometimes just not ask for VAT back because it takes more time to fill the required paperwork than it is worth). None of that is endangering my operations; If it would I would be concerned about my business viability and the margins I am making...

The most lucrative gigs were through agencies or working as a sub-contractor to vendors / systems integrators. Of course, you need to have some specific mad skillz to get the best gigs.<p>Freelancing requires sales, marketing and bookkeeping effort (sometimes that&#x27;s like 30% of the time) You need to consider that some clients are slow to pay or even balk at paying.  Typical gambit is that they pay as you go along, then suddenly they start nit picking and holding back payments.  Having contracts, etc is often met with &quot;I didn&#x27;t understand what you meant! I thought it was ...&quot;  Chasing payments and taking action through small claims court takes a toll in both time and emotionally. That is, more lost income.<p>The other trap is that if you need to borrow money, e.g. for buying a house, the banks need far more documentation than for full-time employees and even then will often charge a premium on the interest rate.  They call it &quot;non-conforming&quot; loans. If you are planning to borrow money, then stay in a full-time job until you secure the loan and then make the jump.  But of course, having to meet repayments is a further source of stress.<p>As many other HNers point out, in addition to technical chops, you need some measure of confidence in your sales, marketing and negotiating skills.",1454327564

You have to genuinely like people and be interested in them to really excel at sales. At the high-end of sales, where you lead sales organizations, sales-metric-based compensation plans will easily exceed that of nearly all programmers save the ones exiting unicorns with founder-level equity positions intact. You are constantly learning both technical and non-technical subject matter. There are grind-y parts, sure (every job has that), but I&#x27;ve never seen in sales the kind of grind programmers routinely endure.<p>Once you establish a successful sales record, you wield enormous influence upon product direction and implementation. If you keep your coding chops up to that point, then it is not inconceivable for you to be able to throw your weight around and pick and choose both what to code and actually implement it. Of course, if you aren&#x27;t good at coding, then the engineering lead will continue to hate your guts. They will all hate your guts at first regardless of your skill level and ability to smoothly work with their teams, but if you are really, really good you can earn the respect of most after awhile.<p>Very good sales people who are still top 20% coders are an extremely rare combination. It would be difficult NOT to stand out in the crowd. That&#x27;s good and bad.<p>The Great Filter in my suggestion is getting out and meeting people trying to connect with them. There are lots and lots of programmers, even &quot;brogrammer&quot;-types, who claim they are very extroverted, etc., who I find will freeze when faced with a list of contacts or a room of strangers and tasked with establishing connections. The vast majority of people, extroverted programmers included, are extroverted with people they know; it&#x27;s human nature. Of those who can manage to overcome that nature, even fewer will come back with a systematic collection of facts and data about their contacts that you can work with as the start of a sales funnel. Of THAT population, even fewer will actually follow through the sales funnel. Out of THAT, anyone who can continue following up prospects and re-running them through a sales funnel under different campaigns is a unicorn. This is why sales is often broken up into pieces and parceled out to different people. But programmers possess a systems-thinking background that uniquely positions them to excel at sales if their personality really fits it.",1454326905

Apparently, the film was made in a 5:3 format which would, if transferred correctly to the current TV aspect ratio (16:9) leave black stripes to the left and the right of the picture. But it would be true to the original. And the only current offer unfortunately cuts off the upper and the lower part of the picture to &quot;fill&quot; the TV screen.<p>The apparent result is that, for example, the scene for which the filmmaker waited weeks before the sky &quot;looks right&quot; almost doesn&#x27;t contain the sky anymore.<p>I know there are customers who just want the &quot;full&quot; picture even if nothing looks how it should (shorter people or missing parts of the content) but those who want to get what author made should probably wait for (hopefully) some later different edition, if it ever happens (&quot;blah blah average customer etc&quot;).

The design of the new structure tells you something about what the newer guys were doing there, and how it differs from what the older guys were doing there.  And if you look really closely, you can see traces of the original footprint of the site (perhaps these are very subtle, some bricks just rising above the dirt in a few places), and infer the purpose of this very old site too.<p>> &quot;If you see the different civilizations that came to this island as embodying different philosophies; and you see the structures they built as representative of the way these philosophies led them to interact with the world; and you see further that when they replaced a site, it represents the rejection of some older worldview that they consider no longer useful, then perhaps you start to get some idea of the amount of backstory that can be encoded into the world, nonverbally.<p>- <a href=""http://the-witness.net/news/2011/12/architecture-in-the-witness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://the-witness.net/news/2011/12/architecture-in-the-witn...</a>",1454326744

For example, Hetzner simply lowers your connection speed if you get above the limit, and you only pay for additional traffic (and speed) if you really want to. Most other providers handle the situation in a similar way.<p>I know that those plans existed since at least ~15 years ago. At that time, our main criterion on a hosting provider was their traffic payment plan. We considered only providers who had a clear upper bound on the monthly costs.<p><i>> I stopped the service as planned, on November 15th, after a two weeks notice.</i><p>This seems to be very short period for closing down a service. Of course, there were no paying customers, so they got more than they paid for. However, some trouble could have been avoided by a longer closing period.

What I will write may sound overly negative, but keep in mind\nthat those are only reasons not to use it, in general I found a lot to like in\nRust.<p>Unsurprisingly most of issues described below, boil down to Rust not being\nmature yet, and are perfectly fixable. However, fixing some of those will break\nbackward compatibility one way or other and require effort that would be\nunnecessary otherwise.<p>Language is underspecified. In what order are subexpression evaluated in Rust?\nUnspecified yet, in fact it is even worse than that, it differs between borrow\ncheckers (which I think uses the most useful one given Rust syntax: right to\nleft behaviour), while code generation assumes left to right order.\n<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28160"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28160</a><p>What can you do with pointers in unsafe parts of code so that everything is\nstill well-defined.

In fact it guarantees much\nless than what would you expect. Take for example a drain method of a Vec.\nDrain gives you an iterator that moves elements out of a Vec. Naive\nimplementation would leave Vec in a inconsistent state while drain iterator is\nstill alive (because some of elements are already moved from), but restore Vec\nto a valid state in destructor of drain iterator. It appears to work because no\none can touch Vec while drain iterators still holds mutable reference to it.\nExcept it wouldn&#x27;t work, because Rust does not guarantee that drain destructor\nwill be executed, in fact in perfectly safe code it may not be executed at all.\nSurprisingly a borrow of a mutable reference may outlive the lifetime of a referent.\nAt least it seems that Rust guarantees that those references would be\ninaccessible.\n<a href=""https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/are-memory-leaks-considered-to-violate-memory-safety/1674/2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/are-memory-leaks-considere...</a><p>There are quite a few language issues like this, and in general I found it very\nhard to find what exactly Rust semantics is.<p>Rust sends mixed signals about panic. On one hand it try to tells you that code\nthat panics is probably badly broken, and may have left data structures in an\ninconsistent state, so you should not even try to access them. And Rust tries\nto ensure this to some degree by putting roadblocks on your way if you think\notherwise (see Mutex poisoning, and strange things like AssertRecoverSafe you\nhave to use when recovering from panics). Except in reality, all your\ndesctructors already do access all those data structures. It seems that all\nthose roadblocks are quite pointless.<p>Running out of memory aborts program. This is I think quite a bad decision (it\nseems that this may be a temporary one) for a language that have exceptions in\nform of panic. Not many programs need to handle out of memory situations, but\nhandling those in programming language with exceptions and RAII is quite easy,\nand mostly boils down to: don&#x27;t perform dynamic memory allocation in\ndestructors. This is a step backwards from C++.<p>Bugs, bugs and more bugs.

I am still not sure if it is\nworth the effort, it seems to prevent problems that I don&#x27;t commit in C++\nanyway.<p>Immature state of ecosystem, libraries, documentation, ... .<p>In general you probably will not be as productive in Rust now as you would be\nin other languages.

Woz doesn't get remotely as much recognition as he deserves for Apple's success.

3080651,comment,3079943,3079943,41,0,tptacek,,,"No. Not a traffic stop. An <i>arrest</i>. Reckless driving, driving without a license, DUI.<p>This probably isn't a great test case to get up in arms about. Here's the opinion:<p><a href=""http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2011/ca-phonesearch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2011/ca-phonesearch.pdf</a><p>Some things you'd want to know before formulating your own opinion:<p>* Since at least '73, the law of the land has been that after you're arrested, the police can without a warrant lawfully search you and the immediate area under your control. The lawful objectives of that search are <i>either</i> officer safety <i>or</i> preservation of evidence. If you're arrested while driving a vehicle, and either of those objectives militate a search of the passenger compartment of your car, the police can search the passenger compartment of your car.<p>* The argument was made here in an earlier hearing that the cell phone search occurred as part of an ""inventory"" search; this is one of the contexts in which cell phones were claimed to be a ""container"". But the controlling appellate opinion here <i>rejected</i> that interpretation; the police cannot search a cell phone to ""inventory"" its contents.<p>* But that is a moot point if you are arrested, because the police are explicitly entitled to search your person and your car <i>for evidence</i> if you're arrested. Don't get arrested! Here we have the second ""phone-as-container"" context: the phone is a container for evidence of crimes. It's this interpretation that the appellate court affirmed, and reasonably so!<p>* More importantly, in this particular case, this guy was screwed from the get-go. He was arrested for driving a car without a license, for which he could not document lawful possession, after doing 90MPH in a 65, on suspicion (later validated) of being under the influence, accompanied by a clearly intoxicated passenger. When the police searched his car incident to the arrest, they found a loaded gun in the car under the drivers seat, along with drug paraphernalia. Then they found the Blackberry with the screensaver set to the guy holding two assault rifles. Face it. <i>That phone was getting searched</i>. The notion that searching the phone pushes the bounds of ""incident to arrest"" searches is <i>at best</i> a technicality; under the same pattern of facts, a warrant for the search would be a no-brainer as well.<p>* ...but it seems extremely dubious to argue that this is even a real technicality. A search of your car is a big deal. The police are not lawfully entitled to invade the privacy of your car without reason. Getting arrested is a big deal. The police are not lawfully entitled to arrest you for no reason (there is a world of difference between arrest and mere ""detention""). The search the police get to conduct when they arrest you is explicitly <i>not</i> limited to officer safety (like the weapons search frisk of a Terry stop). This guy's lawyer argues that the phone search was out of bounds because of an expectation of privacy. <i>What</i> expectation of privacy? They're in your car. They found your gun and your secret drug shit. Your privacy is largely out the window. Your trunk might, for a few minutes, be out of bounds because it's not necessarily <i>your</i> trunk. But the phone with your dumbass picture on it holding assault rifles is clearly yours.<p>Someone downthread had the right practical response to this: <i>lock your phone</i>. There's no secret software the police have that will suck all the info off an iPhone with a 6-digit PIN. Politely decline consent for searches. <i>Do not get in a police officer's face</i>; if you give them a justification to arrest you for any reason, all bets are off. <i>Don't get arrested</i>.",1317918379

I'm disappointed that you've gone off with the ""strip clubs and snort coke"" strawman.  I'm not going to post a sob story for you, but I am going to again request that you stop making assumptions about me and those I know.<p>You're right that the simulator did occasionally offer cheaper options.  What it didn't do is offer <i>good</i> cheaper options when they actually do exist.  The simulator was so caught up in trying to point out how much being poor sucks that it made being poor extra-sucky by sticking you with only ""expensive"" or ""bad"" options and making you choose between them.<p>As an example, you seem to insist that the $325/month car payment is completely legitimate and not at all a reasonable thing to cut back on.  As if the only options are ""new car with an 18% rate"", ""car financed in a shady way"", or ""looks like you can't get to work"".  I've pointed out a number of in-between options, which you keep finding ways to ignore or dismiss.<p>Similarly, the options given for dealing with the dog, the internet, and your phone were unrealistically constrained to ""this option costs a lot"" and ""this option sucks"", when there are decent options that cost less.  These particular scenarios are not no-win scenarios, the game just doesn't let you choose winning options.<p>""Shit creeps up on you"", you're right -- but the better decisions you make, the more easily you're able to weather it (and the less likely you are to get into true no-win scenarios.)  You call solutions <i>I have actually used</i> ""unrealistic"", and then argue that the simulator realistically shows you how hard it is to be poor.  You defend bad decisions and treat good decisions <i>I've actually made</i> as non-options.

I found it  to be also truly inspiring:<p>""A great man has passed.<p>Alas, Ralph Steinman is dead. He died three days before he got the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 2011. He dropped out of no college, he did not make a billion dollar company. He did not make billions of dollars, nor even hundreds of millions, though after his death his estate would receive slightly more than a million dollars of the prize money. Yet, he had touched millions, possibly hundreds of millions of lives and will likely touch billions of men women and children in future generations by discoverying one of the secrets of how immunity against viruses or bacteria are translated into an immune response by adaptation of immune cells. How allergy or autoimmune diseases develop, and how immune cells transmit signales to one another. It is possible that it was the fruits of his research that might have extended the life, after pancreatic cancer several years ago, of another giant who died recently. It is also certain that his work has resulted into billions of dollars worth of pharmaceutical industry, and will produce many billions of dollars worth of pharmaceutical industry, and will produce many billions in the future, Such is the reach of a humble life in fundamental science.""",1317917190

Opinions varied, but many were of the view that a free society needs reasonable equality and can't coexist with large concentrations of economic resources.<p>Thomas Jefferson hoped (futilely) to achieve it by avoiding industrialization, remaining a nation of yeoman farmers and thereby avoiding what he saw as the ills of British industrial capitalism, with its predominance of wage labor, large factories, etc. (he didn't like either the industrialists or their trade-unionist counterparts). That, combined with robust public education.<p>Thomas Paine was a proto-socialist, traveling after the American Revolution to France to help with the revolution there, where his <i>Rights Of Man: Part The Second</i> was one of the first comprehensive proposals for what can now be seen as social democracy, with a progressive income tax and inheritance tax used to fund a social safety net.<p>The existence and independence of corporations was also a pretty active area of controversy until the 1850s or so. Before then, many of the founding generation were of the view that corporations were limited-time constructs under supervision of the state (which held visitation and dissolution rights), not fully independent entities, and were skeptical of corporations with a ""life of their own"", seen as a European pathology (the Dutch East India Company, etc.).",1317916889

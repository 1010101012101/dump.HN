If you create a malformed environment, the unsetenv() call rtld uses to strip the environment will fail. rtld didn't notice the failure and accepted the dangerous variables.<p>This flaw is a riff on one of the all-time greatest Unix localhost findings. Back on SunOS 4.1.3, the ""loadmodule"" program was SUID root and used system() to execute shell commands to do parts of its work. 8lgm found that if an attacker set the shell IFS variable, they could trick the Bourne shell into thinking the path seperator '/' was the token seperator ' ', and thus trick ""loadmodule"" into running a program out of their home directory instead of /sbin.<p>So Sun patched ""loadmodule"" to strip IFS out of the environemnt.<p>So 8lgm wrote a second exploit that set two IFS variables.

I've seen men brush other lower status men away as I've seen women do. However, I can say, women tend to fill that category much more than men do.<p>I think it has more to do with the instinct to mate, than anything else. Women desire to project their masculine self onto a male figure that can most closely match the features of that masculinity. The masculine self having been created by the father figure, most women will seek out men that can fulfill those needs.<p>Hence why women generally date men older, with more social status, and more financial resources and freedom than they. There are obvious exceptions, so please consider those when reading this.",1259685137

Whatever the merit of all these explanations -- it's perceived as dorky, low status, overly masculine, etc... -- the one thing I <i>don't</i> see is a strong desire amongst women to be in the field. It'd be one thing if there were barriers like overt sexism (and perhaps there are), or if you often heard the refrain, ""you know, I'd really like to be a computer programmer, but I can't because of XYZ..."" AFAICT, the real culprit here appears to be self-selection.<p>Assuming that's the case, who cares? Why all the hand wringing? One downside I see is the lack of a ""woman's perspective,"" which, while admittedly important in many fields, seems mostly irrelevant in a field where stuff either works or it doesn't. The other is a lack of interest in the field overall, but it seems a constant source of debate (see any H1B visa thread) as to whether we have a shortage or a glut of qualified workers.<p>[1] This shouldn't be read as a position I'm strongly committed to.<p>EDIT: Criticisms of this post thus far are mostly along the lines of a) a woman's perspective matters more than I give it credit for and b) ""works or doesn't"" is too simplistic. Fair enough. I admit my argument wasn't particularly nuanced (purposefully), hence the ""devil's advocate"" label. Questions I would ask are: wrt point a), is this something we can empirically validate? Or should we just assume any gender imbalance is inherently problematic?

I don't think its in their best interest to do this.

Of the guys, maybe 1 or 2 would drop.<p>Why does this happen? My school <i>is</i> trying hard to get more women in CS and engineering fields, which may mean poorly-qualified girls are being accepted and pushed into these degrees; are we just a statistical anomaly? The numbers in the article would seem to indicate otherwise. Anyone else have insights from their own grading/teaching experiences?<p>Oh, and regarding pair programming, it's the best possible way to make sure you won't want to see your friend's face for another week, because half the time one of you will want to do something the other one just doesn't ""get"", so you sit there and explain it repeatedly when you could have just implemented it by yourself, all the while watching your teammate type with a speed and error frequency generally associated with senile chimpanzees.",1259683493

969951,comment,969619,969619,0,0,jerf,,,"The biggest problem with ""Javascript on the server"" right now is that Javascript has no concurrency story whatsoever. You could easily hack in shared-state threading, but there would be no faster way to turn me off of Javascript forever than to do that. You could hack in message-passing, but it won't be clean and you're still going to have terrible fun trying to not pass mutable references, which, again, if you leave that in I will run screaming. STM isn't exactly going to be easy to stick in either.<p>(I say I will ""run screaming"" not merely because I don't want to deal with it, but because I don't want to deal with yet more libraries based on shared-state concurrency. No. I've left that behind and I'm not going back, and certainly not in a space where I've got an abundance of languages to choose from.)<p>Without a solution to that problem, I see this as a terribly, terribly wrong move, and a terrible time for JS to try to be picking up the server. Servers are <i>in</i> the multicore age and have been for a couple years now.<p>(And if your answer is ""well, we'll just keep all the tasks simple and we won't need multiple threads"", I would remind you that you're running <i>on the server</i>, which often needs to do, you know, <i>actual work</i>. A language that can't do that may have a small niche, but it's going to be an uphill battle against entrenched competitors.)",1259683342

969949,comment,969647,969647,0,0,aho,,,"I was surprised to learn how just little computerization there is in the ER. Each medical device is basically a standalone unit, with its own input and display.  There is no central computer system that automatically alerts doctors if the devices connected to a patient are configured in a potentially dangerous way. For example, apparently it is surprisingly common for surgery teams to use a ventilator, switch to a heart-lung bypass machine, but then forget to turn the ventilator back on once the heart-lung bypass machine is off. This can cause permanent brain damage if the patient doesn't get enough oxygen. There should probably be some system that warns the doctors if both devices are turned off. Unfortunately there is no standard communication protocol for these devices, which makes it impossible to build such a system.

All this data is yours to play with.<p>The Suggest function is pretty neat. Not sure if anyone else is doing it this way.<p>Pass an artist, playlist or text (blog post) and we will suggest some fresh new tracks that you should listen to.<p>We use the ranking data from Hunted to make suggestions and return Grooveshark, Spotify, Myspace or Youtube playable tracks.<p>Rather than use collaborative filtering or song analysis to make recommendations,our suggestions are based
on what we think are the freshest tracks the music experts are listening to right now.<p>Our goal is not extreme accuracy, but extreme freshness, seeking to always deliver music that is new, cool and relevant.<p>We are constantly discovering and ranking new tracks so our suggestions change frequently.<p>Enjoy!<p>Stephen Phillips",1259683292

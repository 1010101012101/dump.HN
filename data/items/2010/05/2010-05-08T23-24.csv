I didn't realize how substantial said traffic was until reading this article.  I scaled my app to that size on my own over the course of 12 months.  I know of other FB devs who scaled bigger apps working solo.  If average hackers like us can do it, anyone can.  The hard part is building a popular app.  Articles about scaling are a means for founders to brag about their success without giving away useful information about what made their app popular in the first place.",1273362979

This was true long before anyone coined the term ""agile"" to describe the idea.<p>Of course, if you choose to adopt something like XP as your process, then you go a lot further. Personally, I consider XP a rather silly idea, because its basic principle is flawed: just because doing something can be helpful, that does <i>not</i> imply that doing it religiously all the time is better.<p>Likewise, the basic idea underlying Scrum is to have a prioritised list of stuff you need to get done, divided into practically sized chunks; to do a small number of them to make your next release that does more useful stuff than the last one; and then to repeat. Again, this is a sensible enough idea, and something that a lot of projects have done for much longer than the name ""Scrum"" has been around. It's only when you start adding on bucketloads of meetings and strict deadlines and people with silly job titles that it becomes rather comical.<p>These problems with taking basically good ideas too far are not Agile's problem.

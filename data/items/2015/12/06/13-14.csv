Russia, China, India and other markets that to some extent have &quot;their own Google&quot; are completely horrible in terms of running companies. Much more so than Europe. The US is no dream in terms of e.g. declaring taxes either. I think this has more to do with attitude than anything else. US companies simply hire someone to do this.<p>2. That would explain why people doesn&#x27;t start companies, if Europe didn&#x27;t already have many successful technology companies. It offers little explanation why those companies doesn&#x27;t go on to become &quot;Googles&quot;.<p>3. I do somewhat agree with this one. Because while the technology industry do pay good salaries in Europe startups usually doesn&#x27;t even though they are in high cost markets. I&#x27;m not sure this is actually that different from the US though. There are huge incentives for &quot;the best&quot; programmers to work at Apple/Google/Facebook where they have higher salary and relative job security, especially if the want to keep up with the housing market.<p>I would say that that almost they entire reason why Europe doesn&#x27;t &quot;have a Google&quot; is because we are part of the US market. All our contenders in the early days used to be domestic. Once we realized that we had to be global US companies bought those that were successful. Skype, for example, could have become a Google if it had been forced to stand on it&#x27;s own or been acquired by a local company like Ericsson. Rather it was built to be sold and was to Microsoft.",1449410354

Fear of a slave revolt was not the primary reason for this right in either time.<p>In U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s D.C. vs Heller (2008) decision ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller</a> ), the court claimed that historically the right to bear arms was:<p>&#x27;&quot;clearly an individual right, having nothing whatsoever to do with service in the militia&quot; and that it was a right not to be disarmed by the Crown and was not the granting of a new right to have arms.&#x27; ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United...</a> )<p>In The Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Aguilar (2013), the history and reason for the 2nd amendment was summarized ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller</a> ):<p>> &quot;guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation&quot; (id. at 592); that &quot;central to&quot; this right is &quot;the inherent right of self-defense&quot;(id. at 628); that &quot;the home&quot; is &quot;where the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute&quot; (id. at 628); and that, &quot;above all other interests,&quot; the second amendment elevates &quot;the right of law abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home&quot; (id. at 635). Based on this understanding, the Court held that a District of Columbia law banning handgun possession in the home violated the second amendment. Id. at 635.[46]<p>If the <i>primary</i> reason for the right to keep and bear arms was to guard against slave revolt, it would have been more central to the discussion. Instead, the U.S. Supreme Court was focused on whether or not it was an individual right to self-defense, and they determined it was. While protecting oneself from a slave revolt could be one case of self-protection it was by no means the primary reason.",1449410242

First of all, programming skills are not homogeneous at all, they are in fact widely dispersed. A bad programmer can very easily destroy value by slowing down his team, in a way that doesn&#x27;t happen in e.g. a factory environment. It&#x27;s also not easy to judge programmer skill pre-hiring, so starting salaries are biased toward the mean, making good programmers underpaid and bad programmers overpaid.<p>Additionally, there are biases, morale considerations, and cultural issues that prevent compensation being equal to value added. Businesses are incredibly averse to firing people (there are some good reasons for this of course, e.g. morale). There is also very strong inequity aversion (again partially a morale issue) that makes it impossible to pay top programmers what they&#x27;re really worth. Both of these issues lead to significant deviations.",1449409788

The parties in the Australia&#x27;s Parliament exercise almost totally complete voting discipline (formally or informally). The UK somewhere in-between with the concept of the three-line whip.<p>In that sense the USA already has a coalition party structure: various voting blocs form within the two parties and occasionally defect against the rest. In Australia we call them &quot;factions&quot;, but their role is to seize control of the party and then enjoy the fruits of party in discipline. In the USA they can instead directly exercise their votes on the floor of Congress.<p>This is partly a consequence of the ability to mix appropriations with other bills and for amendments to happen in committee. In Australia neither of these is possible: appropriations bills can <i>only</i> deal with appropriations or they become totally invalidated, and amendments have to be moved in the open. Party discipline becomes necessary under such conditions, but the <i>Parliament</i> as an institution is arguably more functional.<p>Another cause is the primaries system. Members of Congress are answerable firstly to a constituency that represents outliers of outliers, not to the general electorate.

Video collaboration is no longer a luxury available only for large enterprises or in conference rooms it has become a vital communication tool across all devices enterprise users choose. As video conferencing has become normalized as a software in the workplace, solutions must become lighter, more flexible, and less expensive: especially for businesses who do not want or cannot use cloud solutions.<p>To better meet their customer&#x27;s needs, TrueConf has decided to make secured on-premises video conferencing more affordable. The company has permanently reduced prices for TrueConf Server by 30% to increase the solution’s popularity among SMBs.<p>“One year ago, we released a free version of TrueConf Server, which became hugely popular around the world and has tripled the installation rate of this product. Surprisingly, there is a huge demand for on-premises collaboration products in the era of cloud services. Good old shareware is the most secure choice in the UC&C collaboration space and we can’t resist making more companies happier with our new reduced pricing,” says Michael Gotalsky, TrueConf CEO.<p>You can see the updated prices on the company&#x27;s web site.",1449408316

By setting expectations on accepted behavior.<p>Consider the following: It is a common stereotype that men are more prone to have stronger sexual urges, and this is used to excuse many different behaviours. Sexual objectification of women is one such behaviour, we see this as normal because of the stereotype that men are overwhelmed by such stimulus, and so cannot be held as responsible for such behaviour. The more common the stereotype becomes, the more people use the stereotype to set expectations, which influences what becomes normal for the group in question, regardless of whether it was originally true or not.",1449407233

It matters. Lisp has been Lisp for the past six decades or so. Therefore, someone who learned Lisp in the 1970s thinks that Lisp Is Lisp and therefore hasn't changed, except maybe for a few dialects. (After all, C and Java are just Algol dialects, right?)<p>The fact Clojure actually has a new name is likely more important to its success than anything else the language creator did for it.<p>""I don't know what the technical characteristics of the standard language for scientific and engineering computation in the year 2000 will be... but I know it will be called Fortran.""

Really. I mean the only reason you want to be super super careful about hiring someone is because if they don't work out then you've wasted that time. But if you can lower the cost of hiring enough, and make firing pretty straight forward, then the economics can change.<p>One summer I worked for McDonalds (the fast food chain) for all of four weeks, two in a 'training store' and then two in my assigned store. I was fired pretty quickly. During my training (hamburger flipping) the store manager explained that (at the time) McDonalds would hire anyone with a pulse and no criminal record. They would then train them briefly, and watch them closely, and decide early on if they wanted to keep them around.<p>My ""problem"" was that the store had an algorithm for queuing up burgers which, from my perspective at the grill, was broken. Our store had way more people who ordered Quarter Pounders (one 4 oz patty) than BigMacs (two 2 oz patties). The algorithm though said you had to 'start' twice as many 2 oz patties as 4 oz patties just before the lunch rush. We always were throwing out 2oz patties (you can't sell them after they've been on the warmer too long). So I started cutting back on the 2oz patties I started. Big mistake :-). Got ""the talk"" which was ""We hire people to do things the way we want them done, you may not agree with how things are done but if you want to keep working here you have to do what we say."" Silly me (it was only my second 'real' job) I kept trying to find ways to optimize the system and not get caught. At the two week point my manager recognized that I was a 'trouble maker' and couldn't follow instructions. End of my career right there.<p>Now the moral of the story isn't to make fun of McDonalds but to point out that they made acquiring good ""fits"" for the company straight forward by building a lighter weight hire/fire process than most places have. Folks I know who have worked at Microsoft suggested they had systems which did something similar, hiring at temps, then converting to full time. This made it easier to fire people who were temps in the first place. Google kinda of did that with their 'slotting' process.",1354760744

Basically anyone who does a CS course learns one of these. In comparison, I don't know any programs that use Haskell, oCaml, scala, or ML (I had a single class in which I had to use ML fora single project). What I mean to say is, functional programming is not widely taught. I don't think this is controversial.<p>Do you disagree that any person that is reasonably smart and that you'd want to hire could become productive in c# within a few days, given that they've used java or C++ before. This is a super-low risk gamble. I don't think this is controversial.<p>The only indicator that someone can become productive in F# is that they have experience in one of F#, Lisp, ML, Haskell, etc. I don't think this is controversial.<p>Hiring people is hard. Maybe you haven't been involved in the process, but you have to interview hundreds of people just to find that one person who is smart, is a culture fit in your company, and has enough self-discipline and a high-enough level of consciousness to go about their work in a pragmatic and intelligent manner.<p>Now imagine that you are CTO of a new company and you are deciding between c# and f#.

If your startup doesn't become successful, you'll quickly have to ramp up in having someone else hire you.<p>Assuming we are a rational person, that is we are doing a startup in the hopes that it will be successful, then our plans will facilitate the hiring of many engineers.<p>Fast forward to when we need to hire many engineers.

Revenue for Best Buy is the price tag on consumer electronics. Bust Buy doesn't pull those consumer electronics out of its butt; it pays vendors to acquire those goods, marks them up, and sells them to customers. Best Buy is a public company and is required to account for this difference, which is its gross margin. Best Buy's gross margin hovers around 25%.<p>If it all this suit cost Best Buy were the damages and penalties we already know about, then they are already close to wiped out on the deal (27MM vs. ~35MM, less legal). But that still doesn't capture it, because Best Buy spent money to clone this startup's offering and also to run the company and keep the lights on in the stores, which are expenses not captured in Best Buy's gross margin.<p>Incidentally, the 22MM figure also didn't get pulled out of some judge's butt. If you read the jury's finding, it's the amount of unjust enrichment Best Buy achieved by misusing Techforward's property.<p>In the very worst case scenario, virtually every penny of profit from this program was redirected from Best Buy to the winners of the lawsuit.

But I feel compelled to make the same post in response, and so I want to point out to my fellow HN-ers why I think Facebook is so wonderful. There's also a note about privacy at the bottom[1] since that seems to be a big reason people stay away. I feel as if a lot of people here missed the point and don't understand what the average person sees in this system. I'll try to relay my experience in the hopes that the utility becomes more clear.<p>To most people, especially a shy person, the usefulness of the site is astronomical.<p>Among others I am friends with my boss, my mother, my little cousins. Facebook lets shy people like me keep in touch with a massive amount of people where I can write them the modern equivalent of letters very quickly and easily, as well as let them broadcast their life's updates to me. I can keep in touch with all manner of people. I love writing letters, people love getting letters.<p>Literally, facebook is a modern ""An open letter to my friends"" system. And it's great at it.<p>~~~~~~<p>Without Facebook, I'd have no idea cousin X is having a baby, or that Y is having apartment trouble that I can help them with, or that Z got a new game we can play together, or person A is considering selling their car, and so on. I could find these out on my own, through a series of phone calls that I place daily/weekly/monthly, but its exceedingly hard to do with all relatives, and hard from a motivation perspective if you're shy. Status updates solve that well.<p>If I meet someone at an event and really hit it off (romantically or professionally or friend-ily), I can go on Facebook the next day and look them up by name and add them. No exchanging phone numbers or emails or anything like that. I just search for them and find them. In college it was enormously useful for making friends and I still find it useful now that I've graduated.<p>I made a page for my hometown (90K population city in NH). I broadcast events going on around the city (fireworks, beer festival, city meetings). In this way I help my community learn about the goings-on of the town. It's a surprisingly popular page (more popular than the local newspaper's facebook page).<p>These functions in times past were done with the laborious process of making a million letters or phone calls or in many cases (like my hometown page) scarcely made or not made at all. Facebook is not just a system of open letters, its the new Town Crier.<p>~~~~~~<p>Okay that's off my chest.<p>Sadly as of late its getting a little less great at its function. A lot of the reason for the downturn in usage/usability, sadly, is probably due to the fact that every ad, every sponsored story and sponsored ""like"" is adding to a signal/noise ratio that will make people frown. It's a shame that Facebook's financial success as the model is right now is directly competing with its utility[2], but oh-well. We may have to sigh a bit more, but its still extremely useful to the casual user and has the usage stats to show it.<p>[1] I don't think privacy alone is enough to negate the utility of fbook. All of my privacy options are on the lowest possible setting. I treat anything that occurs on the site as if it were public. I don't see why not, I'm not going to pretend that photos of myself or my wall postings are anywhere near interesting enough to hide. In fact I'm not sure why people who put things on facebook want privacy at all. I never worry that something I say might be picked up on by the wrong person because I'd never say anything that I wouldn't want the world to hear.<p>[2] It may be worth pointing out that I love facebook but would never invest in it for a few reasons, and this is one of them. One could argue Google ads make Google searches more useful. Facebook ads, as they are today, directly impinge on the utility of the platform. But that's a separate topic for another day!",1354759449

I've got kids and my friends are at the getting married / having kids age now as well, so my feed has gone from ""I'm so fucking high!"" pictures to ""Look how cute my ugly baby is!"". Occasionally I use it to contact people whose phone number / e-mail address I don't have, and it's great for that. It's like my White Pages.",1354759403

But anyone who I have ever worked for has praised the hell out of my work.  Interviews have never been a good way of finding ideal candidates.  The best way, IMHO:<p>Give the interviewee one week's worth of work as an ""internship"".  If they care about working for you, they will do it.  It gives them a chance to prove themselves, and you a chance to really evaluate how well they can do the job.",1354759374

Now I find myself at a wall because of my lack of math and statistics background. I've taken R as far as I can, or put more properly, R has taken me as far as I can go without learning more math.<p>With that said, I have little reason to use R right now except for it's excellent plotting ability with ggplot2. Otherwise for data munging, wrangling, connecting to databases, doing unit testing, etc - R is a giant PITA. Better to stick to Python for that. And as I learn D3, I think I'll use R even less for visualization.<p>Therefore R will only be valuable to me once I can harness it's power for data mining and machine learning, which is it's killer feature, IMHO.",1354759369

They earned $140m in the first year, they only had a % chance of paying out for a lawsuit, and the lawsuit was worth less than 20% of the $140m earned. They just profited over $113m (plus the benefit of money now vs. money later) from destroying a startup<p>Business as usual in America nowadays :/",1354759343

I feel that Facebook helps a little with the former but greatly encourages the latter. I know a lot of people whose FB friend list is basically artificial life support for relationships that should have been allowed to fade into the past. FB provides the appearance that the relationship exists and is animated, but really there's still nothing there, and yet you're still paying the price of it in terms of your attention span. Zombie friendships!",1354759334

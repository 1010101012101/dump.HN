When I started, it was part of the culture to have small conversations throughout the day and the team that I worked on had 3 people. The people that talked throughout the day left and eventually the team grew to 8 or 9 with most people wearing headphones. The manager decided that productivity had gone down because of headphones and decided that nobody would be allowed wear them anymore.",1435586369

Still talking about one of most expensive cities in the world. Yes, those people probably don&#x27;t have private bank-levels of salary, but I know a people or two who are curently buying high-priced properties over the border in France, so they are more than OK.<p>Friend in quite high position in Red cross hates UN with passion, stating they are useless in real crysis scenarios, just bureaucrats etc. Not sure if that&#x27;s an objective statement, but there is probably at least some truth there.<p>What I decided to do, at least for now - Amnesty International.

Going forward, there are a few options:<p>- If you are doing project-based work with specific deliverables, delay delivery of the project until payment is received.<p>- Ask for a deposit from the client up front to cover such an eventuality. Depending on how much you want to cover your risk, this could be somewhere between 1/2 to a full month&#x27;s worth of pay. To the client, if they ever want to terminate your consulting agreement, this becomes part of the last month&#x27;s pay.<p>- Ask to be paid in advance for your work, stop working if payment isn&#x27;t made in advance.<p>- Setup your consulting agreements so you are paid more frequently and stop working if you aren&#x27;t paid when agreed. This limits the amount of money that could be owed to you.<p>If you are going to seek legal options for compensation in your current situation, you should try to do it before they shut down and still have assets.

Why are any of these a true measure of intelligence?<p>>> Social life for killer whales, as we have seen, is deeper and more omnipresent than it is for humans<p>This is supposition, at best.<p>>> If orcas have established empathy as a distinctive evolutionary advantage, it might behoove a human race awash in war and psychopathy to pay attention.<p>Let&#x27;s just ignore the way they can turn on one another and fight against other pods. Not to mention the truly brutal ways they hunt other species. So they show what we perceive as empathy. Let&#x27;s apply that idea across all Orcas as if it were a rule, and then compare it to the worst humans in existence. Great.<p>>> The ability to experience positive emotions, like love and attachment, would mean that dogs have a level of sentience comparable to that of a human child<p>This is used as supporting proof, but when read by itself seems more like someone pointing out the obvious flaw of anthropomorphizing the actions of animals.<p>>> The “social cognition” that arises from this kind of richly shared experience of the world would even lead to a different sense of self than humans experience [...] The communal experience might actually change the boundaries of the self to include several individuals [...] This clearly indicates that dolphins—and particularly killer whales [...] have powerful emotional and empathic connection<p>So we&#x27;re jumping from &#x27;could and might&#x27; to saying the evidence &#x27;clearly indicates&#x27; something?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be overly negative, this article just strikes me as someone who is trying to twist what we know to suit their own agenda.",1435585419

The communication overhead and associated documentation is beneficial in the long run as the code that is produced will be better understood by all , not just the lone developer; it also makes code reviews easier and allows new developers to take over existing code base when necessary. It is immature to think developers will only feel pride in their when they own the entire codebase, the ui-to-db stack;   The idea that &quot;Lovingly crafted aesthetics in a codebase is key&quot; is silly; code needs to be testable, well documented and highly optimized and re-usable.The &quot;jostling of positions&quot; are design discussions and they are important  part of the software development cycle.<p>I like Clojure and I am interested in learning ClojureScript but this blog post makes a poor case for it.",1435585245

By prominently displaying Google content in response to search queries, Google is able to leverage its dominance in search to gain customers for this content. This yields serious concerns if the internal content is inferior to organic search results. To investigate, we implement a randomized controlled trial in which we vary the search results that users are shown ­ comparing Google’s current policy of favorable treatment of Google content to results in which external content is displayed. We find that users are 45% more likely to engage with universal search results (i.e. prominently displayed map results on Google) when the results are organically determined. This suggests that by leveraging dominance in search to promote its internal content, Google is reducing social welfare ­ leaving consumers with lower quality results and worse matches.&quot;",1435584150

I think for my next gig, I will spec the rate at the higher figure with a discount for paying within 10 days i.e. $200hr or $150hr if paid within 10 days.<p>(2) Draw up a client services contract. I scoured the internet and drew up a rough version of what I wanted along with a list of goals [example: &quot;I don&#x27;t want <i>any</i> liability&quot;] and sent them to my lawyer to draw up a contracting agreement.

I&#x27;m in software, and in the North; there are definite similarities and differences.<p>For those reading this that are interested in software costs, here&#x27;s a similar breakdown:<p>A Senior Developer (Java, C# being predominant technologies), with around 7-10 years&#x27; experience, or similar QA, good English language, makes around USD 25,000 per year.  The market gets very thin at 10+ years, especially for English speakers in management, and ceilings at around USD 45,000 per year unless the person has had international placements.  [At more junior levels, income is less, with starting salaries at around USD 6 - 8k per year.]<p>For those reading, this is gross salary (individual income tax at 15-30% for these salaries), but the company contributes around 40% in addition to this gross salary as social security benefit.<p>For a bigger city like Shanghai, add 30-40% to the above.<p>A software worker probably won&#x27;t live in a dormitory.  They&#x27;ll have an apartment and mortgage, often close to their office complex (software parks are constructed as mixed commercial-residential developments over 20-30 square kilometers, with residential areas on the peripheral and offices / shopping mall in the center).<p>I&#x27;m surprised your rent is so low.  Modern, international grade office buildings go for around USD 150 per square meter per year (or, around 2.5 Yuan per day).  Bigger cities are a little more.  On the outside of Shanghai it is around 3 Yuan per day for an office in a technology park in the outskirts of the city.<p>Local software parks also do food, but prices are more like $2.5 (15 Yuan) for a meal.",1435583136

However dynamic pressure drops off extremely quickly due to altitude (low air pressure) and max-Q was a good while before the incident, so it wasn&#x27;t a direct issue.  It could obviously be an indirect issue if something started to buckle a minute previous or shook loose and for whatever reason a minute later it burst, perhaps as pressure built up or something.<p>The other meme is there are or have been rockets or overall systems with flight profiles and designs that have unsurvivable portions of the flight.  Or only extremely theoretically survivable.  Think of the old shuttle system, for example.  A RTLS abort was theoretically survivable, but lets be realistic here...  However the space-x guys are extremely proud that they designed an overall system that has no unsurvivable by design flight portions, and also very proud that they did a test flight with a separation near max-q specifically to prove it would work just fine even at max-q...<p>One interesting problem with a structural failure at that speed is it could be hard computationally to tell the difference between some irrelevant pogo-ing or vibration vs 50 ms later half the rocket is flying sideways, at which point it might be unsurvivable.

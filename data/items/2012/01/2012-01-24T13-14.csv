I don't really understand how they determine what's a likely-looking name--even in English, there are a great number of naming cultures: I would imagine the name StJohn Fetherstonhaugh looks as unlikely to an American as Page Lane does to someone from England, but both are ""real"" names.

3504697,comment,3504304,3504304,17,0,JunkDNA,,,"I recognize that Lawrence Lessig is beating this particular drum lately, and he's probably way smarter than me. However, I can't escape the idea that money is the mother's milk of politics. It's like water in that it always finds a way through an obstacle, no matter how much you put in its way. If you eliminate overt lobbying, organizations will find a way to route around whatever laws are in place to lobby covertly, in ways that are likely much harder for the average person to detect.<p>Furthermore, I'd point out that, depending on the form of a ban on lobbying, the recent SOPA protest might not have been able to happen. Google might have been prevented from blacking out their page as would Wikipedia, lest they run afoul of anti-lobbying laws. That's something worth thinking about.<p>It's also not just the business sector that has lobbyists. There are tons of other groups. The Sierra Club and NRA are two biggies that come to mind. As an individual, it's much more efficient for me to throw in with one of those groups to ensure my interests are protected than it is to do it myself. Both are exceptionally effective at getting what they want because they spend all day keeping an eye on elected (and unelected) government officials and their continued existence hinges on their success.<p>I'm not arguing that we have to <i>like</i> this current situation, but it's hard for me to think of a <i>better</i> scenario that doesn't infringe on the rights of people to assemble as a group and voice their opininon via financial support, advertising, etc... Just because some of the time we don't personally like the result of lots of lobbyists, doesn't mean this is the root of all evil. In the end, all the money in the world isn't going to compel ordinary citizens to vote for someone who doesn't have their interests in mind. Exhibit A would be John Corzine who had an incredible fortune at his disposal in his reelection bid as governor of NJ and <i>still</i> lost to Chris Christie in 2009.",1327413307

3504679,comment,3504061,3504312,3,0,_delirium,,,"I more or less agree, and it's interesting that while it's now seen as a (very) ""left"" policy proposal, much of its historic support has been from people who are more associated with free-market economics. Various reasons, but they boil down to a mixture of negative and positive ones.<p>The negative ones are that it's better than the likely alternatives: Milton Friedman thought it was better and less distorting to just hand people one cash payment than deal with the huge mess of welfare, Section 8 housing, food stamps, unemployment benefits, medicaid, etc., etc. that the U.S. currently has. That's sort of the case here, in that just paying people a basic minimum income is probably less distorting than trying to adopt policies to force full employment (France-style policies that make it hard to fire people, protectionist trade tariffs, etc.). Arguably, it makes people more willing to accept major shakeups caused by markets if there's some minimum floor for what happens to people caught in transitions or left out of shifts; otherwise people are more likely to try to push back against the markets. (Actually that last point is why classic Marxists were <i>against</i> these kinds of things, because they thought it had the effect of sugar-coating the markets' effects, thereby making people less willing to revolt against them.)<p>Positive reasons include promoting entrepreneurship (provides a safety net making people, especially those not from middle-class-or-better families, more likely to take the risk of jumping from a stable job to start a business), and giving people more freedom to choose their associations, as opposed to feeling they need to cling to their ethnic group, religious group, or other such organization for quasi-welfare (e.g. many non-believing Mormons stay in the church because it provides a safety net). F.A. Hayek described that as a necessary part of moving towards a less tribalist/group-centric society: <i>""The assurance of a certain minimum income for everyone, or a sort of floor below which nobody need fall even when he is unable to provide for himself, appears not only to be a wholly legitimate protection against a risk common to all, but a necessary part of the Great Society in which the individual no longer has specific claims on the members of the particular small group into which he was born.""</i>",1327412968

  bit like a voyage back in time. The guards wear the peaked

  stations, 86,000km of track, a network of schools and 
  health clinics and even an equestrian school.

  company, such as its schools and clinics, have been around 
  for a century and derive from the difficulties of running a 
  railway in the middle of nowhere. There is no such thing as 
  pure capitalism or pure socialism, he argues; only more or

It merely shows you were able to perform well in a contrived testing environment that has little to do with how you'd actually approach problems in the ""real world"" (that is, everywhere but a test).<p><i>>12-13 weeks is plenty long to learn the material for a course. A student is at a college to learn. It should be their top priority to learn the material during the course.</i><p>I think you're missing the author's point here. Yes, a student is at college/university to learn. However, the job of the institution should be to teach, not to weed out students, and that's where the true failure is taking place. And again, nobody is always in full control of their life. Shit happens, as they say, and just two weeks of illness (or really <i>any</i> unforeseen circumstances) can cost you a whole semester. Some students need to juggle studies, work and getting enough sleep while pretty much having no life because of the horrendous costs of attending higher education (which is a whole other problem entirely).<p><i>>As for ""failure #3"", lectures have been used for hundreds of years because they work.</i><p>That's an appeal to tradition. They haven't been used because they <i>work</i>, but because there was <i>no viable alternative</i>.

They serve a lot more purpose than just holding lectures. You can meet people in the same or adjacent fields as you, you can form connections, work in research (and maybe even stay there after graduation) and many other things. But that doesn't change the point of the article, which is that lectures as a teaching format <i>suck</i> when compared to the alternative.<p><i>>You lose the overall atmosphere of a learning environment through online courses, and that is not something I'd want to give up.</i><p>You'll have to excuse me for being a bit snarky now, but if by ""atmosphere of a learning environment"" you mean cramped lecture rooms, long and drawn-out lectures without much (if any) interaction with the lecturer with the overall process often being more of a hassle than anything else for all involved parties, then no, I don't think that's something worth clinging to because we've done it this way for the last thousand years.",1327411963

Many nave programs free that memory when creating another request by overwriting references to it. However, it should be freed when the request has completed.

Far more important for students' future careers is signalling their performance over the course of three years of relatively autonomous study within a controlled environment of their choosing, and the commitment that entailed.

A lot of the questions are ""do I have enough disposable income"" where the answer is yes.<p>Specifics:<p>> How long does it take to get to work? Do I have to drive to work? If my car breaks, could I buy/lease a late model new car (one that I expect will not have problems)?<p>~10 minutes on bike, slightly quicker in car.  I guess I could buy a new car, but I've never thought that was a good move financially over getting one a few years old.  (Then again, I could just rely on zipcar living here)<p>> Do I live close to friends<p>Almost anyone I know in SF is within a 20 minutes by bike or car. Most are within 10 minutes.<p>> Can I walk to the supermarket, cafe or restaurant,<p>Other than the supermarket, yes; smaller grocery stores are a block away.<p>> How large is my home, in sq. ft? Do I have a yard?<p>130 sq feet personal room, 2 roommates, substantial common space (500 sq feet maybe?), additional storage space. minimal yard.
Admittedly this is where you are going to save huge.  Living with roommates over a 1 bedroom can save $12,000+ a year.<p>>General savings<p>Have a positive savings rate already while making well below $100k.<p>Honestly, the big expenses are just house and car.  As long as you don't splurge on those, you have tons of cash left.<p>(This is coming from the perspective of a single guy in SF.  For a family of 4 consider that down in Sunnyvale, you can find 3 bedroom houses for $2,200. If that household made $200k, they would have very high amounts of disposable income.)",1327410237

(He _did_ title the piece in a provocative manner that _suggested_ he was seeking revenge. That title certainly bought the piece some notoriety.)<p>Instead, PG said ""Kill Hollywood"" because the SOPA/PIPA debacle finally made it apparent to him that these industries are ripe for replacement. Imagine you notice that some middleman in a purchasing chain is starting to try very hard to include terms in their contracts that prohibit their customers from going directly to suppliers. This might make you realize that this middleman is scared of becoming unnecessary as customers go directly to suppliers. The middleman is in a position to know their industry really well... perhaps it's time for you to start up a business matching up the customers with suppliers directly (for a tiny cut, of course), thus killing off the middleman and making yourself a successful company in the process.<p>Well, that's what PG saw going on here. The SOPA/PIPA behavior made him realize that these media companies are focusing on keeping their position rather than on improving their services, which made it obvious that they are in danger of LOSING their position. What a perfect time to launch a company intended to profit from the large-scale changes that will be happening anyway.",1327410166

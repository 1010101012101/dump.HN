9157640,comment,9153521,9157168,0,0,dradtke,,,"1. Go encourages short variable names. I personally think that the names used in the example you pulled are a <i>touch</i> shorter than I myself would use, and &quot;prevRune&quot; is a little bit ambiguous, but I don&#x27;t really mind it since the context makes it more clear.<p>2. Yes, int64() is a cast to an int64 type. The bare &quot;int&quot; type in Go is architecture-dependent, so the compiler will complain if you try to assign an int to an int64 without the cast.<p>3. Rune is a number representing a UTF-8 codepoint. It&#x27;s an alias for int32 the way &quot;byte&quot; would be an alias for in8. (<a href=""http://golang.org/doc/go1#rune"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/go1#rune</a>)<p>4. copy() is a built-in function. There&#x27;s only a small handful of built-in functions defined, and they&#x27;re all documented here: <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/builtin/</a><p>5. The last return statement doesn&#x27;t specify any values because the method signature has already assigned names to those: n for the int, and err for the error, so an empty return means &quot;return the values of the variables n and err&quot;, which default to their respective type&#x27;s 0 values (0 and nil for int and error). Returning the values explicitly still works as seen in that example, and is slightly shorter than &quot;n = 0; err = io.EOF; return&quot;.<p>Go can be tricky to read if you&#x27;re not familiar with some of the semantics, but once you&#x27;ve ramped up a little bit, then things just start falling into place.",1425657375

The fact that they picked someone &quot;better&quot; is obvious if they picked someone at all, and it wasn&#x27;t you.<p>Also, when I hear that particular line, I follow up with &quot;I&#x27;m glad you were able to find someone you like.  Will you keep me in mind the next time you&#x27;re hiring?&quot;  If I get a response at all, it is something noncommittal, like &quot;We keep all applications for a minimum of six months.&quot;<p>Perhaps companies should not focus so narrowly on the current position.  I have applied multiple times to the same companies for different positions, provided my experience with them remains positive.<p>But if, for instance, a company like SAIC schedules an interview with me on a military base, sends an escort to the gate to bring me to the work site, and only <i>then</i> tells me that no one is available to interview me that day, because the supervisors are all halfway across the country, that company lands itself on my blacklist.  Later experiences with employees of that company moved them to my <i>permanent, public</i> blacklist.  Not only will I not apply for any of their positions, but if they appeared on my doorstep with an offer letter in hand, I&#x27;d order them off the property.  And I would recommend that everyone else do the same, for both SAIC and for spinoff spawn Leidos.

They stay in the industry, and may one day be customers or competitors.<p>As it happens, Fog Creek is not on my blacklist, either temporarily or permanently.  But I do feel like their interview process would be a waste of my time if I had to endure it again from the beginning, and I don&#x27;t expect them to ever pick me up again from where we left off.  So I ignore their job postings now.  It won&#x27;t hurt them any, because they get plenty of candidates anyway.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all that anyone who doesn&#x27;t believe that they are good enough to top the 99 other people all applying for the same position wouldn&#x27;t bother investing all that energy to compete, <i>especially when that won&#x27;t help them in their search if they fail</i>.  With no feedback, no referrals, and no helpful suggestions, it really is a lot of effort for a high probability of no reward whatsoever.<p>There may be something embedded in our tribal caveman brains that makes high-risk behaviors more attractive to men than to women.  If so, Fog Creek might be able to attract more female applicants just by guaranteeing <i>something</i> of value at the end of the interview process, regardless of whether the candidate is selected for the next round.",1425657257

I don&#x27;t understand the harm. What bad thing happens when copyright law is not obeyed? I think I understand that the answer is that someone&#x27;s generously written code (like, perhaps, VMWare&#x27;s) may then be taken into private hands without payment and used to benefit a commercial company or private individual. Is that harm? But if so, what&#x27;s the harm? You wrote your code, didn&#x27;t you? I&#x27;m asking in all sincerity: what specific asset or benefit has VMWare lost when someone takes their code and uses it for a commercial product or for private use without paying them?<p>Some people seem to get upset about such events: &quot;The lousy crackers copied this software/game/movie and removed the copy protection, then distributed it for free no the internet. Nobody paid us!&quot; So that&#x27;s the harm? But how is that harmful? How does that hurt VMWare or anyone else whose copyrighted material has been reused without their permission?<p>Perhaps the answer is: &quot;The author of that worked so hard on it and gave such expertise and so much time and now their work is providing benefit to others with no further benefit to the author.&quot; I would certainly agree in general that if you work hard on something and someone copies your work and benefits from it instead of you, then this is a clear and deplorable harm. But if you sell your work for money so that people who pay can benefit from it in general, then you have agreed that your sole benefit is not at issue and that you don&#x27;t mind if other people use it.

Nobody is forcing them one way or the other. If they use GPL, they have used a benefit that open-source community has provided them which they do in exchange for backward contributions that are intended to help other people/corporations using the same GPL code-base as well.<p>I like to believe that corporations would generally agree to the above, though some employees may accidentally violate open source licenses or other forms of IP without realizing (and thereby potentially putting the company&#x27;s business or own IP at risk).  Making employees aware of the licensing issues would help.<p>Interestingly though also, people go through such corporate IP training treating it as bureaucracy. Elsewhere too, I see people copying things from the Internet (e.g., images, music) without adhering to copyright laws. People click on &quot;I agree&quot; without reading, sign employment agreements without having slightest idea of what they says, and so on. I have myself tried to educate people about these several times on Hacker News.<p>Not to defend VMWare here by any means, fixing/mitigating the bigger problem would require increasing general awareness of IP issues at forums like HN and elsewhere, such that the corporations can sanely honor the IP licensing without high costs of employee training and maintaining a sizeable legal department.<p>It also seems to me that lawyers at big corporations can also help by making the legal processes easier.

9157562,comment,9156405,9157372,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"> The problem with this is you keep factoring the costs of a computer, or electricity or an ASIC. It&#x27;s expensive or the user. But for uTorrent, that computer is free.<p>How is that a problem in my analysis? It&#x27;s important.<p>For example say you bought a Macbook Air and came with mining software, used 100% of your CPU and GPU and made your computer unusable. And it generated 1 penny per year in return. And it&#x27;d cost you $100 in electricity.<p>Would you consider it normal to say &#x27;But for Apple it&#x27;s 1 penny, for free! Your analysis is flawed because all those costs, who cares, Apple isn&#x27;t paying for them, for them it&#x27;s a free penny&#x27;.<p>Of course not. It&#x27;s ridiculous. Screwing over your user is not without consequence, there is a cost involved. A moral one, for one, which if you can&#x27;t express financially <i></i>still matters<i></i>. That is, locking up 25% or 50% of a CPU, reducing the lifetime of their CPU and costing them $20 in electricity per year is screwing over your users.<p>But secondly there is also an economic cost, just not directly. But indirectly in the long run, doing things like this will lead people to uninstall and avoid your product. In the exaggerated example about Apple above, it&#x27;s obvious nobody would ever buy that Macbook Air again. A similar thing will happen for uTorrent on a smaller scale, and that&#x27;s a cost.<p>And if your little scheme generates peanuts in revenue, then that cost of losing users is likely bigger than your revenue if you&#x27;d built a less intrusive scheme.<p>As for your example, it&#x27;s from spring 2013. Spring 2013 the hashrate was about 50k, today it&#x27;s 350 million. So literally, the same infected computers today would earn $1.17 in the same period, or about $28 per year. And the electricity costs would be thousands of dollars. Even if you didn&#x27;t have to pay for it, a business model where you screw with your user&#x27;s hardware performance, generate thousands of dollars in costs for them to make $28 is ridiculous.<p>Even if you scale that up from 14 thousand to 14 million users, not with heavy GPUs but average users using their CPU, it&#x27;s absolute peanuts. I showed that already.<p>I&#x27;m not making this up. This is exactly my point, as I mentioned, a few years ago this would&#x27;ve been a brilliant idea, hell even spring 2013, today, not so much.",1425656824

They know when you try to trick them into learning. They know when something looks like a game but it&#x27;s actually a chore. Such thing is just <i>not fun</i>. So if you want to go with the path of gaming, make games with side-effect of education instead of education with side-effect of play.<p>One way you could approach it is by making the skills you want to teach an integral part of the game world, not something that looks like arbitrary limitation. Say, you want to teach kids that moss on trees can be used for navigation, and sun for telling time. Instead of doing stupid quizes about it, just mod Minecraft so that the northen side of tree trunk is green and put some hint in-game that you can use tree&#x27;s shadow to tell the time. Kids will learn those things as useful in-game skills and transfer them to real-life.<p>Another example. You know what&#x27;s <i>the best</i> MO(O)C for basic astrodynamics? <i>Kerbal Space Program</i>.

9157532,comment,9156348,9157266,0,0,soylentcola,,,"I think that at least in theory, the idea is akin to what Google did for regular web advertising.  Originally before targeting the only real strategy was to blanket sites with every sort of ad imaginable and the only way to stand out was to be more annoying and more flashy.  Ad space was worth less so site owners made less money to support their services.  People looking for new customers wasted more money because they could only target very broadly based on the topic or general demographic of a website.<p>Then you got Google ads and the like.  Since you could target based on someone&#x27;s general region or search topics or some other demographic info, ads could be more relevant.  They didn&#x27;t need to be flashy and noisy and could sit alongside search results or website contents as plain text or simple images.  People trying to attract customers could focus their ad budgets where they were more likely to have a return and site owners could charge more for ad space since it was worth more.<p>I think that in theory, cable and other ways of getting TV-type content could move in much the same direction.  Instead of just running more ads and hoping that people watching show (x) will be interested, they could run ads for stuff in your city or things in the categories you&#x27;re interested in.  Higher relevance would mean less total ads for the TV company to make the same profit selling ad space.  It would mean less ads for things you&#x27;ll never be interested in.  And it would mean less money wasted by companies advertising on deaf ears.<p>But yeah...while this could happen I&#x27;m not really that optimistic.  A young Google could take on the old model and replace it but the entrenched TV and cable companies would likely just add it to their arsenal.  Instead of fewer, more lucrative targeted ads paying for now-free service, you&#x27;ll just see the same subscription fees and the same pile of interruptions.

You need to pay income tax - not capital gains - on the spread between the strike price and the fair market value.  Since the company is not publicly traded, the fair market value needs to be assessed.  The IRS has rules on how to do this, but many companies use independent third party auditors to do this, though an early stage company probably would not do this.<p>Once an investment has been made, a fair market value has been established, and you need to report the difference between the strike price and the investment price as income when you exercise options.  Capital gains applies when you later sell the stock for a gain.<p>Edit: Though I should point out, this is only for non-qualified stock options.

The GPL is an attempt to enforce a stronger notion of ownership, so that if you have the software in your possession you <i>can</i> do whatever you like to it. The source code is open, you can modify it, or anything else.<p>So there&#x27;s the harm. The harm is to you.

What bad thing happens when the GPL is not obeyed? I think I understand that the answer is that your generously donated code (Christoph&#x27;s in the article) may then be taken into private hands and used to benefit a commercial company. Is that the harm? But if so, what&#x27;s the harm? You donated your code, didn&#x27;t you? I&#x27;m asking in all sincerity: what specific asset or benefit have you lost when someone takes your GPL code and uses it in their commercial product?<p>The article seems to get upset about this event: &quot;They took Christoph&#x27;s code from Linux and modified it to work with their own kernel without releasing source code of the resulting complete work.&quot; So that&#x27;s the harm? But how is that harmful? How does that hurt Christoph or anyone else?<p>Perhaps the answer is: &quot;Christoph worked so hard on it, and gave such expertise and so much time, and now his work is providing benefit to others with no further benefit to himself.&quot; I would certainly agree in general that if you work hard on something and someone else steals your work and benefits from it instead of you, then this is a clear and deplorable harm. But if you give your work away so that people benefit from it in general, then you have agreed that your sole benefit is not at issue and that you don&#x27;t expect compensation for the work. If someone then uses the work for their own financial benefit, or modifies it without giving you the changes back, what has that deprived you of? Surely that&#x27;s not taking away anything that would have been coming to you had they not done it. Is it?<p>Where&#x27;s the harm?",1425654934

If you want to build quality OSS then you need to engage the development community, not put a gun to their head and force them to open source.<p>Lots of companies open source their products under the AGPL with a commercial license they sell.

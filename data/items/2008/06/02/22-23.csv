207389,comment,206123,206123,0,0,Tamerlin,,,"This trend is similar to the loss of creativity in education. My theory is that it's also a side effect of having teachers who aren't experts in their field; after all, how can you expect someone who doesn't understand physics to teach physics? They'll teach by rote from a textbook, which leads to exactly this. Do the same for the arts and math and every other subject, and you gradually wear the imagination, curiosity, and creativity out of students.<p>It doesn't help that the masses tend to resent the intellectuals... I remember well the looks my friend and I got when we got our AP physics test results back, and the average was 59%, the high was 96%... they knew who got the 96, and they blamed us for blowing the curve.",1212447160

Your eyes will need to make a dramatic focus change between a monitor on your desk and another on your wall, or it's really close to your face, in which case you'll be scanning all over the place looking for stuff). Either way you're probably going to tire them out faster.<p>My boss (day job) has a flat screen TV on his wall that he uses as a third monitor. Some observations:<p>* He doesn't use it very frequently for himself.\n * It's somewhat useful if he wants to show you some content online without you squinting at his on-desk displays\n * The resolution isn't that fantastic.\n * My boss is a Costco freak, so I'm sure the Aquos display he has is from there.<p>So, in my research with a sample space of one, I'd say that it's an okay thing to do, but if you were intending to use the display as a day-to-day second monitor, you'd probably be better off getting something that'll sit next to your laptop.",1212446862
207384,comment,207253,207253,0,0,gcv,,,"I'm not much of a Perl guy (in the past, I used Perl 5 for one-off tasks), and I don't know much about Perl 6, so I don't understand some of the author's finer technical points. I do want to address his point about the ""personal language anti-pattern"" and how it comes up in Lisp.<p>It could be that I haven't read enough old Lisp code, but I have never yet seen this problem. Not once. Lispers use macros all the time to extend the language, but the practice has well-established conventions, and every time I see macros at play, they make the code more terse, and therefore much easier to read. Three typical examples. (1) New with- blocks, such as (with-datastore-connection ...), which abstract away recovery boilerplate. (2) New defclass macros, which provide CLOS classes with special functionality (maybe define-persistent-class). (3) New defun macros which define functions with special behavior (maybe define-memoized-function).<p>Of course macros in the wrong hands are dangerous. A macro called with-open-socket should open and clean up sockets, and if it actually opens a file instead, then the person who wrote it made a horrible blunder. However, this same person will probably do a lot of damage using any tools provided by any language, no matter how restrictive.<p>I have a feeling that a lot of this ""personal language anti-pattern"" FUD, which I've seen before, comes from being burned by bad developers wielding C++ and overusing operator overloading. C++ is probably not a useful template for where language programmability leads to disastrous code, because C++ itself has poorly thought-out and confusingly overloaded operators and syntax. Example: I just love that << and >> are both for bit shifting and stream operations, which brilliantly conflicts with nested templates like list<list<int>>, which must be written as list<list<int> >, note the trailing space.",1212446862

Above a certain cost threshold, many consumers will think harder about a buy and thus decide against an impulse purchase, but if the cost is low enough, they will just buy it, particularly if they are engaging in entertainment already.<p>itunes is one great example, as well as Xbox Live and Second Life.

However, for the end user (and unless I read this article completely wrong, the article discusses software aimed at these people) to get something set up exactly how they want it, Linux doesn't make this an easy task to do quite yet.  Like you said yourself, there's distro's aimed at different tasks.<p>Ideally (to me), some distro could have website that could autodetect hardware and have  a bunch of {check, drop down, radial} boxes for software to put on it.  (Want Fusion? OpenOffice? Gnome or KDE or XFCE or so on? How much information to see? Everything/Quick blurb/Errors only/Whatever else? Hell, if its for the end user, let them upload their own desktop background to use right away.  Little things are important too) The site would then customize the distro and create the iso as needed for the individual.<p>That would in itself go a long way to creating a usable customizable OS that does what people want instead of trying to guess what they want and create yet another variation within the sea of distros.

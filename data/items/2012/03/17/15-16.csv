I believe it failed because Palm just didn't have enough weight behind it (like Google or Apple have) to make it reach critical mass.<p>That said, this isn't the same as WebOS. WebOS ran javascript apps, but they ran on the device itself. From what I can gather, B2G is running everything on the actual web. It's very different.<p>--<p>Edit: I may have been wrong there. Apparently it is running locally. This quote from the web page through me off:<p>""You don't have to pay the penalty of a big smart phone operating system if you're running directly on the web""<p>That's a bit misleading.",1331999981

I'm pretty sure there have been critical bugfixes in Pidgin, and the old Hardy version of Pidgin was so flaky for me 2 years ago (back before my workplace had moved to Lucid) that I installed my own from source.<p>Ubuntu's answer to that? Well, those aren't security fixes, so you can upgrade to $LATEST_RELEASE if you want the non-critical fixes. Ubuntu is trying to force a 2+ year bugfix cycle on software maintainers, and that's just not realistic for many small teams (both proprietary and open source).<p>This is a particular example, but I can think of other cases where this might be a problem.

Trolls are those mythical creatures who somehow get off on harassing people or causing problems.  I'm sure there are 13 year old kids who think its funny to disrupt a community... but %99 of the time I see the word ""troll"" used, it seems to be just calling someone a pejorative to get around making a counter argument.  This guy made a single post on his blog, for gosh sakes.  That's not exactly trolling. Pretty much the opposite, in fact.<p>I tried Rails in 2007. Was really into it for about 3 weeks, then I realized it sucked and stopped using it.  Soon after that I noticed that so many people in the ""rails"" community acted like ""rock stars"" and were snobby jerks.<p>The only difference between me and this guy, that I can see, is he wrote a blog post about it.... and he identifies real things that actually have happened.<p>Oh wait, I get it, the whole ""we're superior rock stars"" attitude is why, anyone who disagrees is automatically a troll, right?   (Seriously, I don't think that's what you're saying, but by calling him a troll you're only confirming his argument.)<p>I think the 37 Signals guys have a lot of good advice.  I know there are good developers in the rails community. I know there are jerks who use other languages (Except erlang, I have never met an erlang jerk) and there are really nice people who use rails.   I think rails sucks ass but I don't go around telling people that.<p>I do wonder, though, if there aren't a lot of naive people who don't know better and only have PHP or other things to compare it to who end up using rails and think its great.  If I hadn't used Web Objects before, I might have thought Rails was great.<p>Am I a troll because I kept my mouth shut for 5 years and said nothing about not liking rails, but now have come out of the closet and admitted it in defense of some guy who made a blog post?<p>PS-- does anyone really want to make the argument that there isn't massive attitude in the Rails community? the one photo of DHH with the ""Fuck You"" slide would refute it.<p>PPS-- And now I see you have all flagged it and buried the story.

Package managers are a nice concept in theory, but Linux on the desktop will never, ever succeed until upgrading (for example) Firefox doesn't result in an install of Unity.  The entire concept of a milestone-based monolithic distro is so broken for desktop use that I can't believe a better alternative hasn't been developed yet.<p>Even as a Linux nerd I'm constantly faced with problems caused by this.  I'm stuck on Ubuntu Natty, for example, because it has the last stable version of Compiz that worked for me on the flgrx ATI drivers.  If I wanted the latest version of Unity (I don't, I think Unity is terrible, but this is just an example) that means I'd have to upgrade Compiz and everything else and get stuck with all the horrible bugs new Compiz versions have with my drivers.  It would also mean upgrading to Gnome 3 which still has many usability regressions (unrelated to Gnome Shell) and in my opinion isn't fully baked yet.  I don't want all that shit just to get the latest version of a single package!<p>(You could perhaps pull it off with some PPA mumbo-jumbo, but you'd have to understand what a PPA is, luck out in finding a PPA in the first place, and messing with them can more than likely bork something up.  Not something for the average-Joe audience Ubuntu is targeting.)<p>Shared libraries made sense in the days of limited space and resources.  They still make sense from a few security perspectives.

Yes, they have this fantastic database - but many people are wary of FB's data collection activities and are guarded with what information they share. My point being, there is low probability they are the last, final large popular social network. The effort necessary to visit, use and become active at other web destinations is simply too low.<p>I personally believe we'll see a flowering of special interest social networks - like github & HN is for us, but across the spectrum of human interests. Such targetted-interest destinations provide a social service FB or G+ is not going to provide. And they don't need to. These other social networks are probably already out there, growing their sub-culture communities right now. Look at Pinterest for example; they appeal to a specific subculture and have decent traction at the moment. FB is like pop radio - too generically bland.<p>Specific purpose social networks will eventually dominate, I believe, because only in such an environment is sophisticated dialogues about the subculture subject matter at hand possible. At the more generic social networks ones' deeper, technical exchanges get interrupted by ""friends"" interjecting meme humor or other info-noise to such exchanges. Who needs that when trying to be serious?",1331998578

It's not.<p>A journalist interviewing an expert (academic, or other specialist) is analogous to the literature review in a research context: you do not have direct observation, but you are assuming that peer review and other mechanisms have ensured the literature is grounded in direct observation.<p>A journalist recounting first-hand experiences or recounting those of people he/she has interviewed is really doing direct data collection or experimentation: the reason you try to get multiple sources for a significant claim is precisely why scientists run experiments multiple times.<p>A journalist claiming second-hand experiences as first-hand is equivalent to claiming to have observational data when in actuality you are relaying the conclusion of another experiment.<p>Take this neuro-toxin example: it happened to N people, but by claiming to meet them personally, he's implying it happens <i>more often</i> but is covered up, which would mean the real prevalence is higher (when in reality, we have no evidence that they are).<p>Or take the suicide rates. By claiming concentration via personal experience, the claim is contrary to what we know through more rigorous data collection, which is that the rates firm-wide are lower than for the Chinese population in general.<p>Also, the problem of your metaphor is you presume that the model f(observed facts, gut instinct, emotion) yields more valid inference than the sum of multiple journalists' f(observed facts). This is crap. If f(gut instinct, emotion) skew systematically -- a more reasonable conclusion than the counterfactual -- then no, your approach is less valid.<p>Nassim Taleb had a nice bit about how he doesn't read the news; instead he reads textbooks or other long-production-cycle reports. This is because, he says, the frontier of knowledge doesn't change very often.

It keeps the systemwide package management from overwriting or otherwise disrupting software it doesn't know about.<p>Software in /s?bin/ /usr/s?bin/ /usr/lib/ etc. is not guaranteed to work on another machine.  A binary could be for a different architecture, even if it was installed by the main package manager.  You can't copy /usr/bin/ binaries from an arm platform to an x86 platform, for instance.  You can't copy optimized crypto software using aes-ni instructions to pre-aes-ni systems; it'll crash.  You can't even reliably copy binaries from a different machine with the same cpu model, if the machines are using different package sets that will result in library incompatibilities.",1331996866

Obviously it's a fun angle for a SXSW talk, but:<p>- The ""depth of catalog"" is actually incorrect -- Spotify has far far more songs than Napster did (you can see in that screenshot even, most logins/servers hit less than 1m songs totally available, and of course those are just total indexed, in reality almost 50% of downloads would not be available.) Yes, you could find niche stuff on Napster-- as a musician in 1999 I would make sure all my stuff was available, pre-release, demos, etc. But we have Soundcloud for that now, so...<p>- The discovery on Napster was non-existent. You could browse through a users' collection, the same way you can browse through playlists today. But the only entry into anything was a search box that only looked at ID3v1 data and filenames. There's been amazing leaps and bounds in discovery since then, and it's very clear by the #s that it's what people wanted -- a guided (radio, playlist) experience over a wild west single song retrieval thing.<p>- Napster was stupid bad at search. There obviously was no catalog resolution and the quality of the results was abysmal. I am pretty sure it was a substring match, for one, and then there was the bad metadata, fake songs, later on a huge spam / ""SEO"" problem.<p>- Not going to get into speed, because it wasn't Napster's fault, but even back then it was far easier to get music elsewhere other than Napster if possible. Ratio FTP sites, hotline, and of course bubblecruft startups building customer bases by selling new CDs for $4. It was very clear at the time even that the distributed nature of Napster was a liability, not a promise, as all the single-server solutions were far more convenient and reliable. But this was not their fault and of course their success inspired everything after it.",1331996608

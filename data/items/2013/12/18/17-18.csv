One to three hours working together on a problem can see serious productivity gains. There&#x27;s no magic to this however; Any collaborative environment gravitates towards this sort of activity naturally.<p>As with most things, balance is necessary. Some solitude to think and reflect, some collaboration to explore your ideas and some pairing to smooth out the rough spots.",1387389586

Unlike in torrents where one download cannot be tied to another and you have plausible deniability that you yourself might&#x27;ve not used that, with bitcoin the history stays.<p>As an example if you issue transactions from your home and from your place of work you are immediately nailed (e.g brought to questioning) even if there are 1000 transactions in your walled made behind 7 proxies. Open WiFi argument doesn&#x27;t hold water in that case.<p>And even a single access from a place that maps to someone will taint the wallet permanently, as an example: Busting a drug ring. Set of wallets are suspected to be a part of a massive drug and money laundering operation (few of the wallet addresses are advertised on silk road and are getting a lot of transactions in, and a bunch of laundering addresses are recognized as a dense cluster in the graph).Then some not so smart subordinate accidentally uses a wallet app from his normal cellphone. That will instantly cause the cops to go after him and investigations will start.<p>Basically if you have ever used your wallet from places where you can be recognized the wallet is tainted. You will be investigated if the said wallet is ever used for anything shady ever.<p>The key here is that even if a single access does not automatically link it to you, multiple accesses will. The only way to keep clean is always route every transaction always trough weird proxies. And hope that everyone you transfer to/from will do the same. Get a gift from your mom who doesn&#x27;t do it? That&#x27;s it. She may be interrogated and you&#x27;re bust.",1387389553

6929173,comment,6922348,6922348,1,0,vitd,,,"I&#x27;ve got 2 stories which may or may not contradict this idea:<p>1) I interviewed a candidate for a junior position. He seemed qualified and came with a recommendation from someone I trust. But during the interview with one of the managers in our group, he indicated that something on his resume was not accurate. He didn&#x27;t directly say that, and he tried to squirm around it by saying he really meant it in this way, etc. etc. The manager took this as a big red flag that this person was not trustworthy or at least not a good match for our group. He was later told he didn&#x27;t get the position. At that point he started emailing me constantly asking what he could do to get in our good graces. I had to tell him that since I wasn&#x27;t the hiring manager there was nothing I could do, and that he had really blown it because it basically looked like he was lying during his interview. Now every time there&#x27;s an opening in our group he emails me looking to apply for the position. This has made me 10x less likely to consider him in the future. (Granted, he didn&#x27;t do his &quot;100 hours&quot;.) But being a pest is not going to get you anywhere. Just suck it up and move on. (I wish someone had taught me how to do that when I was younger. I often got the advice, but wasn&#x27;t able to implement it, much to my detriment.)<p>2) At an earlier job, we had a candidate apply. I thought he was pretty good, but the boss was unimpressed. During the interview I asked him if he&#x27;d read some programming books that I had found useful. He hadn&#x27;t heard of them. The boss rejected him and we hired someone else. A year later we had another position. He applied again, and this time he told me he had read the books and explained how he had put some of the ideas into practice. He didn&#x27;t pester us for a job and he didn&#x27;t act like a psycho or a douche. He just did the hard work of learning what he was missing. We hired him. Later I left that job and started my own company and hired him again. He was a good employee and good at what he did.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine trying to work with the guy from #1 above on a daily basis after seeing him be so persistent and annoying. I would definitely not hire #1 even if he were the most qualified candidate because of how annoying his persistence was.",1387389508

And the same thing goes for the supporters as well. Once politics enters the landscape, it&#x27;s there. It affects who gets considered a &#x27;peer&#x27;, which publications are considered &#x27;objective&#x27;, who gets funded, and scientists&#x27; standings at their employers.<p>One of the key tenets of science is that by repeatably checking predictions, we can put a damper on humans&#x27; standard tribal behavior. The harder these predictions are to check (in this case, due to timescale and noisefloor), the less science actually works. When the results are then repeated dogmatically instead of questioned skeptically, it starts to seem an awful lot like religion.",1387389485

There are a lot of very smart people at Microsoft still, but they are all stymied with the culture of everything having to center around Windows.  X-box was best when it didn&#x27;t have Windows shoved down it&#x27;s throat and the same goes for Mobile.  Now, Windows is having Mobile shoved down its throat by an increasingly desperate and frenetic management that is drowning in incompetence, and they&#x27;re taking everyone down around them.<p>What they need to do is just admit that the industry is changing on too many fronts too quickly, and this idea of having horizontal integration across multiple products is unfeasible.  Having integration of Internet Explorer into Windows, or the same with Office worked.  But they keep going back to the same well too many times.

6929132,comment,6928715,6929065,1,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>Can I ask the thinking behind how you name your products?</i><p>Sure, it&#x27;s all based on our overall branding theory.  The company name is &quot;Fogbeam Labs&quot; and the logo is a lighthouse, and our (current) slogan is &quot;Cut through the information fog&quot;.  So everything is based on ideas around light, illumination, and helping people see what is currently unseen.   Given that, Quoddy, Heceta, Neddick and Hatteras are all named after famous lighthouses.<p>At one time we debated using a model where those names <i>would</i> be more like &quot;internal names&quot; and would be the name of the Open Source project, and then using a different name for the &quot;branded&quot; commercial release.  Something like the way Red Hat use &quot;Fedora&quot; for their upstream distro and &quot;RHEL&quot; for their branded release, or &quot;Wildfly&quot; for the upstream JBoss and &quot;JBOSS EAP&quot; for the branded release of that.<p>But when we sat down to think about doing that, we kept coming back up with scenarios like<p>&quot;Quoddy&quot; -> &quot;Fogbeam Enterprise Social Whatever&quot;<p>or<p>&quot;Hatteras&quot; -> &quot;Fogbeam Business Event Engine&quot;<p>and nobody on our team liked &quot;Fogbeam Enterprise Social Whatever&quot; and the ilk.<p>So we decided just to use the &quot;base&quot; names, and tag &quot;Enterprise&quot; onto the end to discriminate between the underlying OSS project and the commercially supported releases.<p>&quot;Quoddy&quot; -> &quot;Quoddy Enterprise&quot;<p>etc.<p>Is it perfect?  Probably not, but we&#x27;re running with it for now.  If it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working, we may revisit it.<p>As an aside, I did learn one important lesson during all this... at one time, I was trying to be too cute with using lighthouse related terms, and we had a project named &quot;Screwpile&quot;.  A little later, one of our advisors pointed out that &quot;it makes sense if you know what screwpile means[1], but nobody does, and if you don&#x27;t, it just sounds ugly, almost vulgar even&quot;.  And then I realized just how bad that was.  We yanked that and renamed it &quot;Fogcutter&quot; instead.  :-)<p><i>I had some difficulty understanding what you are selling - a groupware suite with API integration?</i><p>I try to shy away from using the term &quot;groupware&quot; because it has existing connotations that don&#x27;t necessarily apply to what we&#x27;re doing.  I&#x27;d probably say a &quot;suite of knowledge management tools&quot; over saying &quot;groupware&quot;, but we are kind on the boundaries of the existing terminology to some extent, so we&#x27;re still iterating on the terminology to use in our messaging.<p>But basically, we have - in Quoddy - an &quot;enterprise social network&quot; (kinda like Jive or Yammer), but with much better support for integrating with other enterprise applications and knowledge sources, and using semantic integration to fully unite knowledge and information across disparate sources, so we can provide relevant context at the user&#x27;s fingertips when they are examining any given event, task, or piece of content.<p>Neddick, on the other hand, is like &quot;Reddit for the Enterprise&quot;.  It&#x27;s link sharing, social news, and that sort of thing, but - again - tailored more to be useful as a tool within an organization.<p><i>If all your sub-products make sense used as part of a suite, why not talk about the suite and it&#x27;s capabilities, rather than a collection of products with strange names?</i><p>That&#x27;s another place where we&#x27;re still exploring what&#x27;s going to make the most sense.  Are people going to want to hear about (and buy) the entire suite, or are significant numbers of people going to want one piece, or the other, but not both?  We don&#x27;t know the answer to that yet, so it&#x27;s all still in a state of flux.   Ideally, as we learn more about how people react to this, the messaging and branding will become more clear.<p><i>(hope this is useful feedback, good luck!)</i><p>It is, and thanks!<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw-pile_lighthouse\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw-pile_lighthouse</a>",1387389137

6928968,comment,6928715,6928715,1,0,mindcrime,,,"We actually &quot;launched&quot; as a <i>company</i>[1] way before 2013, but now that I think about it, 2013 was significant for us in that we only really had a product &quot;for sale&quot; this year.  We announced[2] LA (Limited Availability) of two of our products in 2013.   We had hoped to close our first deal in 2013, but barring a miracle in the next week, that isn&#x27;t going to happen.  But going in 2014, things are looking very encouraging.<p>So, given that, I&#x27;d say that the following points from TFA resonated with me:<p><i>Your idea was too big</i><p>What we&#x27;re working on is big, and as a result, it&#x27;s taken what feels like forever just to get to this point.  In hindsight, we might could have decomposed things a bit more, and done more to look for a way to get traction with a subset of the overall vision.  And that&#x27;s an adjustment that we are actually still looking into making.  In 2014, we&#x27;ll probably launch a SaaS version of our Information Discovery Platform, tailed for use as a &quot;sales intelligence&quot; tool, and targeted at sales teams.  We&#x27;ve gotten some very positive feedback on this idea from a number of sales teams, so we&#x27;re pretty excited about that.   Had we decided to go this route sooner, we might be a lot better off now.  But, hindsight is 20/20.<p><i>You didn’t build an audience</i><p>We only started <i>really</i> &quot;working&quot; social-media with an eye towards specifically trying to grow our audience, in 2013.  I mean, we had a blog and a Twitter account and a Facebook page and the gamut all along... but last year we started taking it seriously.  What I have come to realize is that growing an audience is a lot of work, but it <i>is</i> somewhat predictable.  There are things, that if you do those things, will result in more Twitter followers, more mailing list signups, etc.  We haven&#x27;t dived full-bore into &quot;growth hacking&quot; but are definitely seeing the importance of these ideas.<p>The other thing we hope to do in 2014 is more marketing efforts, including:  presenting at user-groups and Meetups that relate to what we do, hosting Google Hangout sessions, and/or Twitter &quot;live chats&quot; on topics related to our domain, still more &quot;content marketing&quot; via our blog, and maybe even writing and publishing a book (or two).<p><i>You tried doing it alone</i><p>Did that for the first year I was working on Fogbeam, but we&#x27;ve grown in fits and starts.  IMO, you should invite people to join you when the time is right, and not <i>just</i> to say you &quot;aren&#x27;t a solo founder&quot;.   We have three members on the founding team now, and a fourth person we&#x27;re talking to about joining up to do sales.  It&#x27;s taken time, but we&#x27;ve been patient and looked for good fits.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://www.fogbeam.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fogbeam.com</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://fogbeam.com/news.html#press_release_08282013\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fogbeam.com/news.html#press_release_08282013</a>",1387387848

We don&#x27;t have any references to external CSS and JS files. This means there is almost no reason for the browser to stop painting the webpage as soon as it starts getting the document or even fractions of it. This means that the user never gets impatient cause it seems that his device is doing nothing. I know this seems like a huge management hassle in terms of changing things, but we got over that by using a server side helper library that spits out the HTML of all the components based on certain input parameters. That way the HTML of the user interface is even more modular and centralized than CSS etc. Besides, it also makes the making of new pages a craft project of sticking different user interface blocks together.<p>2. All user-interface images for buttons and icons and all are in image sprites. So, an average page is just 2-3 requests. Also sprites once cached load beautifully. In fact, it also makes for a much more pleasing page load as opposed to some parts of the page coming in and some coming in a little bit later.<p>3. All background repeating images are make 1px thick and saved as optimized as JPEGS and then made part of the CSS with base64 encoding.<p>4. Of course we very aggressively cache and reduce DB calls and combine DB calls etc etc.<p>Having done all this, we find that our pages load...well more or less instantly at least with respect to what matters to an average human. But this instant loading is only on a network where the initial connection time is not relevant. On 2G & 3G even, all the optimizations in the world cant save you from the fact that the device takes a LONG time to just connect as Ilya Grigorik has mentioned in his presentation.",1387387676

His capitalization of the word would seem to indicate that, or that Stross is woefully ignorant of even the most basic fundamentals of the extremely broad category of political philosophy called &quot;libertarianism.&quot; I tend to think it&#x27;s the latter, based on his ludicrous summary of his perception of libertarianism.

In terms of acid principles wouldn&#x27;t you want your transactions to be durable.<p>>Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory.",1387386145
6928721,comment,6928559,6928559,1,0,krupan,,,"I&#x27;m not sure how to react to this.  On the one hand it makes me think, shame on Toyota for having such poor code quality.  On the other hand I ask myself, would any codebase survive 18 months of scrutiny by a team of industry experts that only need to prove that a bug in the code <i>could</i> have caused a malfunction?  As a consumer the first really worries me (and more particularly as a Toyota owner, though I&#x27;m almost more worried about the products I use who&#x27;s code hasn&#x27;t yet been scrutinized by Michael Barr).  As an engineer the second worries me.<p>Concern about that second case is an important thing to have as an engineer, don&#x27;t get me wrong, we should definitely put effort and care into making products safe and reliable.  One thing, however, that was missing from the analysis of the Toyota code (at least from what I read) was the estimated probability of a code malfunction occurring and causing a problem.<p>Nothing is perfect and simply pointing out potential failure modes without characterizing further their likelihood under the various conditions that could cause them seems like plain old fear mongering (which, I suppose, served the purposes of the plaintiff in this case precisely).",1387386145

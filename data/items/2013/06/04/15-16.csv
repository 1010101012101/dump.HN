Now, they purchased Pardot, which is a decent, if basic marketing automation tool - good for small business but nowhere near an Eloqua or a Marketo - more comparable to Hubspot.  So the question is how integrated they can make all these various tools.  To date the Pardot/ExactTarget integration was rather weak - probably more to come on that front.  I could see a world where they use Pardot's front end and ExactTarget just for scale email sending but the existing user base won't appreciate that move.<p>Now, I look at the integration (or lack thereof) with existing Salesforce acquisitions, and I have little confidence that Salesforce will be able to build a world-class, fully integrated product.  For reference, look at the integration of Buddy Media or Radian6.  So Salesforce may have all the tools, but true integration between the tools has been historically lacking.  Now they're adding a company that is strong in B2C email and has a small B2B marketing automation tool that they themselves are trying to integrate.  Sounds very complex and difficult - and sounds like something that would take a number of years to get right.<p>The real question for me is what now happens to Marketo and Hubspot - Hubspot, for example, has an investment from Salesforce, but was probably unavailable for acquisition as they want to spin public.  Now that Marketo is public, and it looks like their business is not very sustainable (based on my read of the S-1), they'll likely see their stock price dip to the point where they look more interesting as an acquisition to someone.  They're valued at around $800m right now - so if they show poor financial metrics, I'd expect that to dip.  If they get cut in half, then a pick-up in the $600-800m range becomes viable - about the same price as Eloqua - but I'm not sure who would be the buyer at this point.<p>I think Salesforce did the right thing in terms of topline revenue (ExactTarget does around $300m vs. $65m for Marketo) and customers (ExactTarget has large B2C brands, Marketo mainly B2B), but they bought a far inferior product.  Maybe they pickup another company in the space for the product?",1370361328

More complex things can be run on top of it (e.g. via chroot), but the system I boot into is only about 16MB.  With some effort, it could be shrunk to about 1/4 of that size.<p>2. Use only open source software; and refine your methods for searching through code for suspicious things.  There's no shortage of open source solutions and folks right here on HN (e.g. Russ Cox) have been kind enough to share some decent methods for efficiently searching through code.<p>3. Boot from read-only external media, use a memory disk for the root filesystem and use tmpfs for all writable directories/partitions.  This way boot times are fast and consistent, more so than with harddisk drives.  And with the rootfs in memory, you can remove the external media after booting, freeing up the USB or SD card port for other things.  It's very easy to replicate (clone, image, whatever you choose to call it) this system and transfer it to more external media.  It takes only a short time to compile from scratch, even on underpowered computers.  There is no ""software installation"".  You insert the media and boot.  That's it.

Blub falls right in the middle of the abstractness continuum. It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.</i><p><i>And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either of them. Of course he wouldn't program in machine language. That's what compilers are for. And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how anyone can get anything done with it. It doesn't even have x (Blub feature of your choice).</i><p><i>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</i><p><i>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub. How can you get anything done in Blub? It doesn't even have y.</i><p><i>By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. (This is probably what Eric Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can't trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.</i>",1370359546

And the press office is mostly honest with you, because so many people are reporting on me and no-one would listen to what I had to say if I wasn't mostly honest.<p>So, there's no advantage in investigative journalism, which is relatively expensive.

Go to the heading entitled ""Church Numerals,"" which explains how numerals are declared as functions. Above we've been introduced to lambda function notation, which is fine. Now he throws this at you:<p>0 = s.z. z the function s is applied to the argument z zero times<p>1 = s.z. s z the function s is applied once<p>2 = s.z. s (s z) the function s is applied twice<p><i>What the bleep is 's'?!?!?</i><p>I spent several minutes trying to figure that out.

Every math class I attended in college would consist of a mathematician who threw symbols and notations at you, proceeded to do stuff with them, and then <i>maybe</i> got around to defining them after he'd already expected you to get it. Maybe. If he feels like it.<p>It's like teaching a foreign language by beginning with poetry reading, progressing to literary theory, and then oh by the way -- as an unimportant aside -- visiting the topic of words' meanings and their grammar.<p>Why do mathematicians do this? Are they working to make their subject impossible to explain? Or is it some weird artifact of how the mathematically-inclined think-- do they think nonlinearly and so do not grasp that people learn things by building up ideas hierarchically?<p>If math were taught by beginning with symbols and operators and their conceptual meaning and then progressing to their use, I think people would have far less of a problem with it. It would be like learning any other language, followed by learning the ""literature"" that is expressed in that language.<p>Edit: I sometimes see programming languages explained this way too.

The system introduced in this article is for reloading code but with a consistent state.<p>For example, if your application includes some state from previous actions. Then you change a function that acts on that state, but with a different protocol (e.g. data structure expectations changed in the function). Then your application would not work, as the old state is invalid for the new function. With techniques like explained in the article, you can quickly ""reboot"" your state to be consistent with your new code by reseeding your system.",1370359271

This is the opposite of the whole picture-your-audience-naked thing, and tends to actually put you in the right frame of mind: calm, kind, genuine.<p>2. Practice pre-speaking breathing exercises. Controlled exhalation tends to calm the spiking physiological events that come with nervousness (e.g. increased heart rate, shaky voice, sweating). If you can practice this often before you speak, you can quickly calm those physical responses when you actually need to.<p>3. Prepare and Review... your audience. A core principle of teaching is that education is mostly review. In your presentation, always begin by preparing your audience for what you are going to teach them, review material at key points before you move on to other things, then review everything again before you conclude. Never give your audience an opportunity to get lost.<p>4. Don't over-estimate what your audience knows (this tends to come with under estimating the value of what you know and are going to share). Take time to build concepts and review them and you build your arguments. Keep it simple. No jargon.<p>5. Don't underestimate what your audience knows. Balance your material with a solid foundation of simple, approachable stuff and pepper it with things that stretch your audience's minds.

Since we aren't hosting web apps, we don't have the web routing complexity that you have, but we do share a lot of the backend pieces (OpenVZ and unionFS in our case).",1370358104

5819759,comment,5819051,5819740,3,0,tptacek,,,"Yes, there is, since ""trusted computing"" mostly refers to the idea of locking your running OS down so that attackers can't persist code that alters it. Which makes your clumsy ""Bueller"" thing all the funnier: it's like you literally can't imagine that hardware should be any more secure than an 80386.",1370358030

5883028,comment,5879553,5882625,2,0,btilly,,,"Some of these examples are good, others not so much.<p>Consider the first one.  The conquest, while brutal, was merely the finale of a horrible civil war that was going on before we got there.  And a military dictatorship that was only able to maintain power because we supported it really wasn&#x27;t a legitimate government no matter how you slice it.<p>Now Laos I grant you.  But the conquest of Cambodia put an end to one of the worst genocides since WW II.  The Khmer Rouge killed 20% of the country.  Unfortunately after they were evicted from power, the USA took the approach that &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; and supported their attempts to retake power for decades.<p>There is a lot of legitimate room for debate about that one.<p>Some of the others, of course, I&#x27;m in full agreement with you on.  But you really should have just stuck to your best examples.  (That would be the crushing of would-be democratic governments in post-war Eastern and Central Europe.)",1371250758

The Luddite petition is arguing that allowing these people to fall into idleness simply because there is a more effective machine to do their job will be toxic to society.  This is somewhat confused by the Luddites also throwing out a lot of half-baked economic arguments, but those can be safely ignored in hindsight.<p>Krugman then proposes a solution from an entirely opposite viewpoint: that the purpose of work is to <i>produce useful things</i>, and if the constant disruption of jobs is the cost of efficiency, we should just give the affected a handout to provide for their needs.<p>But because the guaranteed income doesn&#x27;t solve the Luddite&#x27;s complaint, it misses the point entirely.",1371250703

5883020,comment,5882422,5882926,1,0,msandford,,,"Sure, but who decides what the right number is for a basic income?  No matter what number you pick there will be a portion of the population who sees that number as &quot;good enough&quot; and will cease to work.<p>As the basic income grows, more people will choose not to work.  This is good as it reduces the supply of labor, thus increasing the wages of those who do work.  But it also reduces the amount of income available for taxation, as this basic income isn&#x27;t taxed.  And as the tax base is reduced through a higher basic income, more money is needed to pay that basic income.  That drives up the tax rate.  It wouldn&#x27;t be terribly difficult to find yourself in a situation where the math simply doesn&#x27;t work.<p>This analysis also neglects the increase in prices that might accompany such a system.  The higher the basic income the more likely you are to see an increase in prices that guts the effectiveness of the basic income.",1371250598

The amount AI would have to advance from its current state to &quot;very close to human-level intelligence&quot; would have to be orders of magnitude more than it has evolved from its initial state to its present state (over the last 50-60 years). Pray tell, what technologies can you name that evolved faster in their second half-century than their first?<p>Does that mean we definitely won&#x27;t have human-scale AI in 50 years? No, because revolutions are impossible to predict. What it does mean, however, is that human-scale AI is not the predictable outcome of existing evolutionary trends. Indeed, developments in AI more or less stalled out in the 1980&#x27;s, most of what we&#x27;ve seen to date is new applications of techniques pioneered decades ago.<p>To use an analogy, what do you think CPU clockspeeds will be 10 years from now?

5882963,comment,5882422,5882879,27,0,_delirium,,,"There&#x27;s a difference between everyone getting <i>some</i> money and some kind of pure communism. Proposals for a basic income aren&#x27;t arguing that in a 10m-population country, each person&#x27;s basic income will be equal to 1/10m of GDP.<p>In addition, many of the gains from technological advances are currently <i>not</i> reaped by the people who actually produce them, because technology is a very interlocked system, and monetization does not track it perfectly. For example, some technologies are produced by a chain involving basic-science research, applied-science research, engineering R&D, and product research, but the earlier parts of that chain are, in many cases, not really cut in on the profits. Sometimes that&#x27;s because basic science/math is not patentable, partly b/c capturing every bit of value you create is in practice difficult, and partly because there is no good mechanism for capturing longer-term value, e.g. if you invent something today which produces a commercializable product in 30 years, any patent will have expired.<p>Sometimes that&#x27;s a good thing: the general technological level increases, and technologies become essentially owned by humanity in general. But &quot;owned by humanity in general&quot; is a fairly nebulous concept, since they don&#x27;t necessarily benefit people equally: the people best posed to benefit from the common heritage of previous generations&#x27; technological advances are those with sufficient wealth to utilize them, e.g. to build new technologies on them or factories to produce them. (Admittedly not always... whether new technologies tend to concentrate wealth or dissipate it varies and depends on a lot of factors.)<p>Dystopian fiction fairly often poses this thought experiment: Take a situation where all human food needs can eventually be produced by purely mechanized means, and that this has been the case for 100 or 200 years. Does this mean all human food needs are solved? Not if the land and robots are owned by a small subset of humans: in that case you have the strange result that a subset of humans has control over all the food, <i>even though</i> they neither produce the food by their own labor, nor invented the technology that produces the food.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think the basic-income solution is a particularly radical one. If robots are doing an increasing amount of work, and some portion of today&#x27;s robots are the result of our common ancestors&#x27; ingenuity, it&#x27;s a really rough floor function on &quot;what portion of robot labor should go to human X?&quot;. So everyone gets at least some smallish portion of the robots&#x27; output, or put differently, a smallish portion of the automation dividend. Then the rest can be allocated with regular market mechanisms. (One advantage from a pro-market position is that a basic income might remove political pressure for other kinds of social-support policies that interfere with markets more, like making it hard to fire people.)",1371249915

Parodoxically, this operates the opposite way that Nordic countries apparently do: here, you are <i>less</i> likely to get in trouble for using extreme force (eg. shooting someone in the head) than trying to use less extreme force (eg. breaking their wrist and disarming them), because the extreme reaction shows that you were under a clear and present danger and had to act quickly, while a more measured response indicates that you had time to think and consider your actions, and if you had time to think you probably had time to do things within the existing legal framework like escape or call the police.  (All this, of course, is subject to other circumstances: if you break into someone&#x27;s house and shoot them in the head, it&#x27;s significantly different from if they break into your house and you shoot them in the head.)<p>The interesting thing is that the U.S. system seems to function from within the head of the accused: given the situation <i>as you perceived it</i>, did you believe you had no other options other than deadly force on your attacker?

It has very few parallels in human history.<p>When someone invokes the 5th, it is as a pleasant reminder that you still are subject to a judicial system that places the burden of proof on the <i>government</i> to prove an <i>innocent</i> defendant guilty. That is how the framers intended it to be--a decisive and enduring departure from bygone days where you were at danger of being forced to incriminate yourself by variously questionable (and sometimes horrific) means.<p>Citizens invoking the 5th has become in recent decades a vilified action, and this is <i>very dangerous</i>. The reasoning behind a person&#x27;s invocation of their right against self-incrimination does not matter, and ought not be up to anyone else to judge the merits of. We even instituted Miranda rights to further cement this protection in legal proceedings and the public mind.<p>I despise the grandstanding and partisanship of American politics. However, when an public official (high-ranking or not; it doesn&#x27;t matter) invokes the 5th, I take this to mean that the specific question and the implications of answering it, in the particular setting/context in which it is asked causes a person to have reasonable cause and/or justification to &quot;apprehend danger from a direct answer&quot; (<i>Hoffman v. United States</i>). In <i>Grunewald v. United States</i>, the Court held that &quot;one of the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s basic functions is to protect innocent persons who might otherwise be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.&quot;<p>In a justice system that holds <i>every person</i> is <i>innocent until proven guilty</i>, that means <i>every person</i>--be they high-ranking official, lowly clerical assistant, or anyone in between.<p>Universe forbid you ever find yourself accused of a crime, but you will likely find yourself very appreciative of having a constitutional right that affords you the privilege of refusing to testify against yourself in moments you fear direct answers may place you in a dangerous legal position.<p>Justice requires evidence, not a measurement of your confidence. Let us support uncovering the necessary evidence to understand what has occurred in any given situation, and refrain from prognosticating guilt before then. If we don&#x27;t, or if we continue to allow the public support of the 5th Amendment to erode further, we may not like the kind of justice we have decades from now.",1371249790

I said people seem to have no <i>desire</i> to understand it and make sense of it because they are, to put it bluntly, too self-absorbed. Some of this is due to choice, and some of it is due to circumstance.<p>Out of these two categories, I gladly and righteously pass value judgment on the former - I believe it is everyone&#x27;s civic duty to care about what is going on in their country. If one makes the choice to not perform that duty, that means they are taking what they have (i.e. their freedoms) for granted, and that is the most disadvantageous thing they can do if the ultimate goal is for them to keep what they have. Thomas Jefferson said it himself: the price of freedom is constant vigilance. If you don&#x27;t pay that price, you don&#x27;t deserve your freedoms.<p>For the latter category, I cannot pass judgment because a lot of people do not have the means to determine their circumstance. If one has to work sixteen hours to pay the bills, then they won&#x27;t have any energy to think about much else. I gave my own roommate as an example.

5882880,comment,5882422,5882422,9,0,john_b,,,"In many ways I think the industrial revolution has made us forget a very important historical fact. Prior to industrialization, &quot;labor&quot; was often little more than serfdom. &quot;Labor&quot; in the purest sense didn&#x27;t own anything, but was simply a necessary component for the wealth-producing activities of those who did. Laborers only had one economic move: to offer their time and hands in the service of those who owned things (land, a shop, a ship, etc) in return for a wage. That wage, effectively their value as laborers, was determined by the law of supply and demand. All the industrial revolution did was to vastly increase the demand for labor.<p>However, the ancient fact that one&#x27;s existence as more than a serf required ownership of something did not change. The living standards of serfs simply improved dramatically. Those living standards still depended on the demand for labor being high and/or the supply low.<p>When technology reduces the demand for labor, while the supply increases due to population growth, it&#x27;s easy to think that the economic sky is falling. But since none of us have lived in a pre-industrial revolution era, we are accustomed to thinking of wage-earning labor as an economic strategy that is more common than ownership of property, and just as valid. But historically it has been a specialized and risky economic strategy, and as the demand for labor-intensive physical products decreases it should not be surprising if those who are dependent on this economic strategy suffer. It may be tragic, but it&#x27;s certainly not a new tragedy.<p>If you want long term economic security, own something.",1371248988

Who put you in charge of how people should order their priorities, or made you the arbiter of how people gauge their freedom? I understand that you find the NSA monitoring intolerable and consider it an imposition upon your freedom, but you seem baffled by the idea that anyone might have come to a different conclusion from you about this. You assume that it must be because their minds are taken up with other matters which you consider trivial, and that they simply don&#x27;t have the &#x27;mental bandwidth&#x27; to understand what&#x27;s going on, unlike yourself.<p>Now, granted that this is true of some people, and there are a good many people out there that have simply never thought about these issues. But there are others (such as myself) that have thought about them and don&#x27;t share your views. Historically it seems to me that the trend has been towards greater transparency, more responsive government, and a greater degree of individual autonomy. I hold this view in spite of the fact that I assumed the NSA was accumulating data on a vast scale before these revelations (both because it was obvious that the Patriot Act was designed to facilitate such information-gathering, and because of the existence of other systems that already existed for that purpose).<p>I have no expectation or especial desire to convert you to my point of view; you&#x27;re perfectly free to disagree with it. What I object to is your assumption that there&#x27;s no possible way that anyone could understand what&#x27;s going on and not share your view. Posting in all caps doesn&#x27;t make your argument any clearer, it just tells me that you&#x27;re feeling frustrated by the discovery that there are people who don&#x27;t share your perspective.<p>If you have time, I invite you to read this essay, &#x27;The paranoid Style in American Politics,&#x27; which was written in 1965 but still remains entirely relevant today: <a href=""http://archive.harpers.org/1964/11/pdf/HarpersMagazine-1964-11-0014706.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJXATU3VRJAAA66RA&Expires=1371250527&Signature=UcMWochGyh%2B2PDmtWvTbwcrsL4g%3D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.harpers.org/1964/11/pdf/HarpersMagazine-1964-...</a> I offer it not to suggest that you are paranoid, but because it effectively sketches out the limiting nature of discourse based around Manichean assumptions and zero-sum representations of what are complex and multi-faceted issues.",1371247776

Probably not.<p>So what we&#x27;ve discovered is that context matters.  The folks at Apple treated the negotiation with Derek the same as all the folks at the labels (where secrecy is probably the default and nothing needed to be said).  Derek assumed that the people he was talking to understood the nature of his business (much, much different than a big music label) and would tell him if he needed to keep his trap shut.  No such words were said and thus, he assumed everything was cool.<p>Was it potentially stupid of him to assume everything was cool?  Yeah maybe.

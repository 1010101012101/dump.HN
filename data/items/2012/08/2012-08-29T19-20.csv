4450742,comment,4450244,4450563,21,0,freyrs3,,,"> Design is about usability and understanding the user<p>Here's the point you're missing. The overwhelming majority Linux users don't give a flying hoot about the average user or mass adoption. They just want a system that gets out of their way and let's them do their technical tasks. Linux succeeds and excels at this because it is precisely designed for that niche and curated by its end-users.<p>There are however people who do care about mass adoption, i.e. Canonical, ""Linux Advocates"". Generally they're either emotionally invested in Linux for some reason or they get a paycheck for their work. These people are the minority of Linux users.<p>Saying the culture doesn't care about design is absurd, it's the non-technical user we don't care about. Let's not conflate the two. Looking at a piece of software like XMonad or TMux it's hard to not appreciate the elegance in it's design. It's just different form of design that say iTunes or Photoshop.",1346270320

4450738,comment,4449241,4450657,3,0,jedbrown,,,"Some big players including Google and Microsoft are in favor of fairly drastic patent reform. The fact that they have to play the game (because that's how the legal system is set up) does not imply that they think the system is good for their bottom line.<p>I'm in favor of a ""King James I moment"", revoking all prior patents. The problem with pure maintenance fees is that it does nothing to prevent overlapping patents. Also, truly innovative patents may not prove their worth for several years (this is sort of the point), but the original company may not be able to afford the huge fee during the early years. If a big company could just buy it for 20x whatever the inventor is paying for maintenance, the inventor can easily be shut out of the market.",1346270276
4450737,comment,4450244,4450501,19,0,jsnell,,,"I have used Linux as my main desktop and laptop OS for 17 years, and see these problems frequently. It used to be a system I could keep completely in my head, and understand what was happening and why. But from maybe 2005 onwards there has been a persistent and accelerating trend of replacing the old working and transparent (though possibly a bit baroque) infrastructure with fancy new components that are completely inscrutable. And the lack of transparency gets worse and worse the thicker these layers of garbage get. It's mostly fine as long as things work. But things never seem to work if you have a configuration that differs even a bit from the default.<p>Want to log in from a terminal and start X? Well, too bad there's some new infrastructure this month that makes sure you'll only get access to the sound device when you log in from a properly configured gdm. Want to modify the keyboard layout? Whoops, the xmodmap format that had been stable for a couple of decades now changed for the third time in a year. Want to add a tmpfs on /tmp to fstab? Well, too bad. Some implicit and undebuggable circular dependencies in systemd will make the system unbootable.<p>And the sad parts are that the problems this new infrastructure is supposed to solve never actually existed. ""Great, now audio doesn't work at all. But if it worked, it would have full support for network transparency"". It's easy to understand why the problem exists - creating something new tends to be more rewarding than working on the old stuff. It's much harder to see how to fix this madness.",1346270254

It is not as if the hand really grabs the screen. I also got the impression that he had to issue a command, chosen from the top of the screen (outside the video image) to switch from scaling to rotation. Another argument could be that this user does not actually seem to touch the screen (at least, that is my impression). It is likely that all these are due to technological limitations, but if I had to defend this as ""not prior art"" in court, I would try and work from those observations.

Getting an OS to be popular is just incredibly difficult and it needs way more than just good driver support and/or good software. It needs marketing, talking to manufacturers, dedicated and well payed devs, designers, UI and UX professionals, sales, R&D and so on and so forth.<p>Focusing on the technicality of drivers and API is typical of us devs, but it has nothing to do with why Linux didn't take off on the desktop, sure Linux did fail because it couldn't do any or some of that well, but why couldn't it do any or some of that? Because it didn't have a huge and focused company pushing for it. How many popular desktop OS are there? Only 2, I think that's enough to show that it's incredibly hard to get into that market and that only a huge company can make it. Also, let's not forget that Windows was good enough and there was not much Linux could do to attract users, in fact this is still true and probably why even OS X is still at 5%: Windows is good enough and it's the de facto standard used by +90%.

That's nice. Pay $10M/year to maintain it. The value would come into play in estimation of damages (e.g., patent infringement limited to patent value per violator, or at most 3 times as much for willful infringement); and alternatively in an ""eminent domain"" style seizure - someone could take the patent away from you in return for 20 times declared value.<p>The mechanics are non trivial, but can be solved in such a way that they create an incentive not to overstate the worth of a patent, yet still provide protection to inventors - and it would put old and new patents on equal footing.",1346269397

Even windows, crappy as it may be, has it.<p>Before I go on, let me say that Design is NOT ""making it look pretty"".  In fact, thinking that this is what design is, is what leads many linux advocates to reject the needs of design.<p>Apple's work looks pretty-- <i>because</i> it is designed to function well.<p>Design is about usability and understanding the user and making an interface for the user that works well according to the users understanding, perspective and needs.<p>Design is an engineering discipline.<p>Seriously.<p>The Linux community hasn't had that, and I've seen many of them reject it.  In fact, you can see it in the rejection of apple's patents.  This is why they think that apple patents are not original is because they reject that any engineering went into them.  But that's just one example.  You see it all the time in lots of contexts.  Look at the UIs of Linux... they didn't design one, they just copied windows.<p>Literal copying is about as far from design as you can get.<p>Sure, over the years, designers have taken cracks at bringing design to linux, including the work of Ubuntu, but it is rejected by the community.<p>Rejection of design is a cultural trait of the linux community. They reject it as a discipline, doesn't even see that it exists. (broadly speaking, of course.)<p>But as users, they have been influenced by it and many of them have switched to OS X because it is the best designed operating system.<p>And then they write long blog posts about how its wrong that OS X does things a certain way ... based on their lack of design perspective that would let them see why things should work that way.<p>Its ironic.<p>But its fine- if you want to run a linux desktop and don't value or care about design, more power to you.  Won't ever fault someone for making that decision.

It was not until college that I began to see the essence of math is creativity. Kids are naturally creative and inquisitive and we should use this to our advantage in early education. We should explore topics like topology and infinity, topics that still blow my adult, math-major mind. We also need to encourage students to be creators in math. One of the ways we learn to love reading is by writing and making up our own stories. We can have students make puzzles, write computer programs, and see that they can invent things with math.<p>For a more informed perspective on how we teach math all wrong, I recommend Lockhart's Lament: <a href=""http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf</a>",1346268267

The full GUI foundation for Gnome, and one that is far from feature complete at that, and it only has one guy working on it.<p>It has also lost a lot of people and companies associated with it at the time betting on this possibility [of it winning the desktop].

Miguel moved on, Ximian moved on, Hazel moved on, Rasterman moved on, etc etc. Even Adobe quit developing Flash for it.<p>And it also lost a lot of ""alpha geeks"" to OS X, which wasn't even commercially available at the time (1997-2001).

For example, one key difference between Ember and Knockout is that Ember's binding system automatically avoids triggering the same side-effect from multiple pieces of code.<p>For example, if you had a piece of the DOM that was calculated from several observables (the stupid example is a full name calculated from a salutation, first name and last name), and made changes to all three of those in separate lines of code (possibly in different areas of your codebase), Ember would ensure that the DOM only updated a single time, not three times. This is true no matter where the three lines of code are, without you needing to take any special action to coalesce the changes.<p>This aspect of Ember's codebase adds some magic, in that it introduces a higher-level abstraction that knows about computed properties and their side-effects (the ""run loop""), but the end result is more predictable propagation of side-effects in an Ember application. Ember applications don't need to know about the specific mechanism that makes this work, but good Ember developers are aware that many side-effects happen asynchronously in an Ember application.<p>The browser does something similar when you make changes to DOM structures: it only updates the rendered version of the DOM once all of the JavaScript code handling an event has completed.<p>I would agree that something simpler would probably be a better fit for simple ""islands of richness"" on an existing application, but there are definitely a large number of applications with significant amounts of logic happening on the client side, even if those applications run inside of an area of a larger traditional page.<p>In general, I would say that Ember is a good fit for applications that will end up with more than 100k of application code. That sounds like a lot of code, but it's really only a lot of code for islands of richness. Applications like rdio, documentcloud, soundcloud and other popular Backbone applications can easily reach 500k or even a megabytes or two of code.",1346268085

Since the volume of people is small, and enough of those people are sufficiently influential, the IRS looks the other way.<p>I think this is maybe a little misleading (at least to those who don't know much about them) because trusts generally don't really shelter income from the IRS. For the most part, they just change timing. Trusts, in fact, can actually be subject to higher tax rates than most individuals are.

A half day is a bit extravagant, but acceptable because a company wants to be conservative.  Taking someone from programming question to programming question tells you right there that the company is incompetent in its hiring process, which means it isn't going to hire good people, which means you'll not be working in the best environment.<p>Seriously- if you're asked to write code in an interview, your interviewer is incompetent at the job he's been tasked with.  This means whether you pass or not, the interview is capricious and a waste of time.  It also tells you a great deal about the management of the company.<p>Being asked the write code is what junior programmers do when they are put into this situation, gleeful at the chance to try and make a candidate squirm and still full of enough hormones to see a potential new hire as a challenge to their position.  Anyone with experience in software development knows it is not a performance art and that this kind of challenge is all about the interviewers ego, not about producing useful information.  You can figure out what you need to know simply by talking to the candidate (and if you can't, you shouldn't be interviewing.)  It really is a tragedy that this kind of cargo cult questioning has become so common, but it is also why companies are so messed up.  Bad hiring processes produce bad teams.<p>But of course, the problem with bad teams is they don't know they are bad.<p>Patio you are being judgmental towards this guy based on your projections of your own inadequacy (e.g. feeling the need to be deferential to people who are abusing you.)<p>Politely leaving an interview with a company that has proven to you that, not only is it not a good fit, but they are incompetent at interviewing is not ""socially inept"", it is actually quite the opposite. It is the meek nerd who is afraid of what others think of him who will subject himself to abuse only to avoid an akward situation or confronting someone.<p>If people's skins are so thin that they cannot handle you canceling the interview, when they are clearly in the wrong, then that's their problem.<p>You can't limit your life by other people's insecurities.<p>The idea that an interview is some sort of power affair where the meek come and beg for the charity of a job is silly.<p>Showing integrity by not wasting people's time-- whether it is by having a quality interview process, or by leaving one that is a waste of time, should be honored.  And anyone who gets upset that someone else exhibits integrity, well, are they really going to be much of an ally in the future.<p>Also, for what its worth, I've worked in software for 20+ years, and worked for a lot of startups.  Only once have I worked with someone at one company and then worked with them again at a later company, and it was a complete coincidence.

For example, I have a rule that detects a microcontroller that is waiting to be programmed with avrdude in avr109 mode that symlinks the raw device (/dev/ttyUSB<whatever>) to /dev/avr109.  I then have a script that waits for inotify to detect the symlink, and then call avrdude to program the microcontroller.  A few lines of shell scripting (actually, it's in my Makefile), and I can just plug in a microcontroller, press the programming button on it, and everything just works.

And Miquel is definitely among the most UI-focused of the hacker set.  He's also an inconsolate ""platform fan"".  Much of his early work was chasing Microsoft products and technologies, of course; now he's an iPhone nut apparently, and that doesn't really surprise me.<p>But at the same time the Linux desktop was never really in the game. I use it (Gnome 3 currently) and prefer it.  Lots of others do.  For many, it really does just work better.

So while having the money won't 'hurt' you in some sense, there's the possibility that you'd receive that money from financial aid anyway, and by saving e.g. $10,000, you've reduced your financial aid eligibility by the same amount.<p>Of course, if you <i>are</i> able to save up the cost of college (>$200,000 for private schools) over two decades - or at least come reasonably close - then yes, it is good to have that money at the end of the term in case you <i>wouldn't</i> have qualified for financial aid anyway, but as you can see, having the fund doesn't <i>necessarily</i> leave you better off than the alternative.<p>The kicker is that the very-wealthy <i>are</i> able to secure vast amounts of financial aid for their children. I went to an Ivy League school, so I'll speak to their policies, as all Ivy League schools but one have the same financial aid policy: guaranteed to meet 100% of 'demonstrated need'. The problem is that 'demonstrated need' is very easy to manipulate <i>if</i> you're savvy enough to know how to reduce your taxable income, reduce your child's net worth to zero (or less), and exploit several other loopholes that are nevertheless entirely legal.<p>The end result is that I had some classmates whose families were wealthy enough to donate tens of thousands of dollars in charitable donations, and yet they also received the top financial aid packages reserved for the 'high need' (ie, very poor) families.<p>All of that is orthogonal to the company we're discussing: it's possible they may help, and it's possible that they may 'do no harm' (ie, it will be a wash for the family).

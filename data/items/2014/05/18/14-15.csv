7763233,comment,7762805,7762805,8,0,xiaq,,,"This module doesn&#x27;t seem to make it possible to type-annotate map and filter, which are Python builtins.<p>I believe that dynamic typing results from frustration over generics, rather than over static typing in general. (Type stuttering is another problem, but modern languages solve it with local type inference.) I mean, annotating non-generic functions is always straightforward doesn&#x27;t introduce much complexity:<p><pre><code>    # s should be str\n    # returns nothing\n    def print(s):\n        ...\n\n    # just becomes (using Py3 annotation syntax)\n    def print(s: str) -> None:\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nHowever, it&#x27;s much harder to write a type annotation of generic functions. Worse, remember that Python&#x27;s map is <i>variadic</i>.<p><pre><code>    # for any types t0, t1, t2, ... tn:\n    # fn is a function that takes arguments of types t0, t1, ... t(n-1)\n    # and returns a value of type tn;\n    # seqs are iterables of types t0, t1, ... t(n-1);\n    # returns a list of type tn.\n    def map(fn, *seqs):\n        ...\n\n    # How to write this signature is non-obvious\n</code></pre>\nMany mature static typing systems would allow you to express such types (usually called parameterized types). But any one of them would require more than those trivial notations in print.<p>That&#x27;s when the dynamic typing people get annoyed and go &quot;fxxk static typing systems, I can handle this in my mind&quot;. Which is about 65% (totally random estimation) the point of dynamic typing in my opinion.<p>Any type checker for dynamic typed languages that doesn&#x27;t seriously try to solve the generics problem is not genuinely interesting.",1400425005
7763232,comment,7762010,7762010,3,0,FD3SA,,,"The most interesting aspect of the modern mating paradigm is the opportunity costs associated with mate-seeking behavior, and the impacts on successful societies.<p>Most primate societies are focused on mating and survival, without much surplus effort remaining for any other tasks. Humans, by virtue of technology and social engineering, have gained a rare ability to dedicate an incredible amount of time to creating heretofore unfathomable works of the imagination such as science, engineering, art, music and literature.<p>Though many believe this was natural progression, there still exist a few human societies that are effectively hunter gatherers, and expend little energy in advancing their societies technologically. The trillion dollar question is this: what role do mating paradigms play in determining societal structure?<p>My own hypothesis, and one shared by a surprising number of old scholars, is that mating paradigms are a fundamental determinant of societal structure.<p>There is a very strong correlation in history between societies that practised very strict mating policies and those that are considered successful. In fact, it seems increasingly likely that the purpose of strict religious practices was to tightly control the mating marketplace in order to prevent the devastating opportunity costs associated with a no holds barred mating market.<p>As such, I&#x27;m interested where the increasingly liberal sexual marketplace will lead societies. Men who spend too much of their time creating wonderful works of art, but fail to reproduce, will be unsuccessful in the long run. Many born in this day and age believe modern civilization has always existed, and will always continue. However, as many countries around the world demonstrate, advanced civilization is an extremely unstable equilibrium. A perturbation of even one pillar can have disastrous, irreversible consequences.<p>We live in interesting times.",1400424983

People have thought that they could make an easier version of Quickbooks and break open the market. Perhaps someone will. But one reason no one wants to leave QB is because its hard enough to know accounting and QB. If you start by learning QB then you are scared off of learning another program.<p>So software opportunities, desktop or otherwise, are about getting new users before they are indoctrinated into hard to use products. So its a long game to earn a monopoly. And if you give them a superior experience they are more likely to be open minded about switching to something else.

It would probably be much harder for you (as a smoker) to choose to not smoke a cigarette today than for me (as a non-smoker).

They just detect changed code.<p>I agree. This is where I think the distinction between classical and mockist testing [1] is useful. These days, most TDD involves mocking or stubbing every single dependency, effectively turning your units into a white box - &quot;isolated TDD.&quot; When one has code whose implementation is known by and manipulated by client code, refactoring will almost certainly break stuff.<p>Why would you want to liberally refactor code when you know you will break 10 of your tests and have to rewrite them?<p>One frequently sees hardcore TDD advocates patting themselves on the back for isolating everything, because... now they can swap the database for a third-party API, in-memory store, remote service, or whatever. Really? You&#x27;re going to replace the database with something that has wildly different reliability constraints? And why would you ever need to replace your database with a remote third-party service? I&#x27;m sure it <i>can</i> be useful, but for most people, YAGNI.

Forward about 8 years later and I continued doing those lifts:  deadlifts, cleans, etc.  I always focused strictly on my form, but I also challenged myself and kept adding weight as long as I could lift it properly.  Well, about two years ago I was in the gym deadlifting a significant amount of weight.  I was going for one rep.  As I was slightly above my ankles, I felt my form slip very slightly and my lower back just collapsed.  I spent the better part of the next year rehabbing and doing physical therapy to help repair a buldging disc.

Learning to deadlift properly takes months even under personalized instruction; learning to squat with perfect form takes much longer; and learning to properly perform olympic lifts like the clean and jerk takes the longest. This also assumes that the new lifter is even capable of performing the movement (many have weak lower backs and mobility issues which need to be addressed on an individual level before they can start performing powerlifts or olympic lifts).<p>The notion that you will be able to immediately perform these lifts competently is absurd as the author points out, and putting new lifters in scenarios where there is minimal personal instruction with a goal of speed and high repetition instead of proper execution of the lift is a recipe for injury. As someone who has gotten injured even when performing powerlifts with proper technique, seeing other people put themselves in situations where they are going to get hurt + advocating that others do so actively annoys me.<p>Also, I take issue with the fact that you assume that my dislike for crossfit is rooted in some sort of powerlifting elitism. This couldn&#x27;t be farther from the truth.

As said by other posters, CrossFit is <i>huge</i>. And it&#x27;s not like McDonald&#x27;s - there&#x27;s a large amount of variation that&#x27;s inherent in an organization that barely looks at its members. Instructors are free to come up with whatever program they want.<p>2. Most personal trainers know absolutely nothing about actually training people. They know what works for them, but they have a very hard time in applying workouts to other people. The workout plan that fits a 220-pound male rugby player is not going to fit a 110-pound female volleyball player or a 350-pound couch potato who is trying to get into shape. Applying the same program to these three people is going to lead to disaster.<p>3. Crossfit is <i>different</i> from traditional weightlifting, which seems to attract a certain class of people. These people basically say, &quot;I made this switch, and it&#x27;s done wonders for me! The old paradigm is flawed, and you&#x27;re an idiot for sticking with it!&quot; You&#x27;ll notice this incredibly annoying group of people whenever there&#x27;s an alternative - religion, programming languages / frameworks, etc.<p>4. Apply #1, #2, and #3, - a very large organization with idiots who loosely fall under it, and a group of people who look down on anyone who isn&#x27;t a member, and you get a group of people who are really, really easy to hate. And, to some extent, it&#x27;s completely true. You get the stereotype of the typical CrossFit user who won&#x27;t shut the fuck up, makes fun of people who go to &quot;regular&quot; gyms, and doesn&#x27;t actually know what he&#x27;s talking about. It leads to the jokes of &quot;The first rule of CrossFit is to talk about CrossFit&quot; and &quot;A CrossFit workout isn&#x27;t complete until you post it on Facebook.&quot;<p>My own experience with CrossFit is that some parts are perfectly fine; there&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with circuit courses, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with explosive movement. The problem is when you start doing exercises that require lots of weight and proper form and then CrossFit them - doing as many reps as possible as quickly as you can. Push-ups? Go for it. Burpees? Be careful, but go for it. Snatch, deadlifts, and pull-ups[1]? No, and run far far away before you tear your rotator cuff.<p>The last thing is that CrossFit doesn&#x27;t seem to have a goal in mind. As Mark Rippetoe states, &quot;<i>Exercise</i> is physical activity for its own sake, a workout done for the effect it produces today, during the workout or right after you&#x27;re through. <i>Training</i> is physical activity done with a longer-term goal in mind, the constituent workouts of which are specifically designed to produce that goal.&quot;[2]<p>This is supremely important. Even someone whose goal is as simple as &quot;Lose weight&quot; and &quot;Look more muscular&quot; needs a <i>training</i> goal, not an <i>exercise</i> goal. CrossFit doesn&#x27;t seem to deliver that. They talk about their goal being all-around fitness, but they don&#x27;t have a good methodology for doing so. Take a look at what decathletes, strongmen, and even the CrossFit Games athletes are doing - it certainly isn&#x27;t CrossFit. That, in and of itself, should let you know that something is badly wrong.<p>[1]<a href=""http://cdn.styleforum.net/3/37/314x314px-LL-375a6e39_TooBO.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.styleforum.net/3/37/314x314px-LL-375a6e39_TooBO.g...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.t-nation.com/training/crossfit-the-good-bad-and-the-ugly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.t-nation.com/training/crossfit-the-good-bad-and-t...</a>",1400422365

A former employer mandated TDD, and I did my best to follow their practices. It doesn&#x27;t lead me to better modularization, more maintainable code, or really, any less bugs.<p>However, going back to code that actually has a real test suite around it is invaluable. It&#x27;s not really because the tests prevent you from breaking the code: More often than not, it&#x27;s the test that needs fixing. The value comes from the tests behaving as living documentation. It lets me see why someone, at some point, wanted the code there. Then I can evaluate if the reasons are still valid, and wonder if the old requirements still make sense, or whether my updated requirements are going to be an issue, because someone forgot some byzantine case that the tests just reminded us of.<p>Now, the question is whether we are better off getting here through TDD and a quest for full test coverage, or something higher level, like Specification by Example. But either way, if the domain is complex enough, either will cover a need that static, non-executable documentation handles way worse, because old school paper documentation goes stale very quickly.<p>So how does TDD affect design? Mostly by making sure that you aren&#x27;t writing pieces of code that are so complicated they are untestable, and frankly, you should probably be avoiding that in the first place.",1400421945

If your labor is not worth more than $25/h to your employer you&#x27;ll just lose your job (or never get hired in the first place.)<p>What you&#x27;re saying here is that raising the minimum wage doesn&#x27;t necessarily cause a particular person&#x27;s income to change at the same job that he/she had before. What it does is shift business models that depend on slave labor for their margins. It forces innovation and automation, and the people who can&#x27;t acquire the skills needed can <i>then</i> rely on a basic income. I don&#x27;t understand why the government subsidizes margins made on the backs of labor by supplementing their wages with welfare payments.<p>If the government is supporting people, it should be reaping the benefits of their labor rather than private interests. If it can&#x27;t come up with work that they can do, it should make sure that they&#x27;re comfortable.",1400421889

7763080,comment,7762868,7763016,1,0,ollysb,,,">> When you&#x27;re refactoring code to reduce coupling, you absolutely HAVE to do it with system level tests.<p>I think this comes about because tests are written against every class in your system. I find unit tests are far more useful if you focus on testing abstractions rather than every single class e.g. you have a reporting abstraction in your code, instead of testing every class used within that abstraction you only test the public API that you want to expose. This allows you to do black box testing which is infinitely better when it comes to refactoring, you should be able to restructure the internals of that particular API without having to change your unit tests at all.<p>My feeling is that a lot of the frustration with TDD at the moment is that people are writing tests for every public method in their system. If you focus more on the behaviour of your abstractions you gain a lot more freedom when refactoring and can greatly reduce the number of tests you write without reducing coverage.",1400421683

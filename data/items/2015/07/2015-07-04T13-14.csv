Any language whose implementation allows you to read and write files can already do a lot of things (including GUIs, IPC and so on). There are very few wheels to reinvent. Furthermore, any program that wants to integrate with yours also needs to do nothing other than open, read, write and close files. You can expose any function or configuration variable of your programs through files -- and all you need to do for that is to read and write byte or UTF-8 streams.<p>Things go a bit further than just &quot;IPC is done by reading and writing files&quot;. It&#x27;s only one of the principles behind Plan 9&#x27;s approach to files and filesystems.",1436016497

The reasoning behind this is, I think, an incoming email stands alone, whereas a chat message is quickly surrounded by other messages.<p>This is critical. Understandably, &quot;chat&quot; user interfaces don&#x27;t make individual messages stand out by themselves. This means that it is easy to miss a message, or even a conversation. It also means that you can&#x27;t delete everything but the important stuff you need to reply to, which is trivial in email clients.",1436016406

The setting has dramatically changed, so there is a lot of new worldbuilding; the overall narrative shifts to focus on a new central character; there is a return to the more philosophical content of the original as opposed to the strictly expository content of the first two sequels; and the writing itself is (in my opinion) much more lovingly crafted than the prose in the first two sequels which seemed to me as a reader as if it was rushed like he just wanted to spit it out and be done with that part of the narrative.  I know I&#x27;m really just evangelizing on the basis of my personal reaction to the books but again, if you&#x27;ve alrady read the first two sequels, pop into a Barnes and Noble or something and give the first few chapters of God Emperor a chance.",1436016281

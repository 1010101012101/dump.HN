In bigger cities like Mumbai, it's already pretty apparent with most kids growing up indifferent to the complex caste adherence of the past. Most of these kids would not be able to attribute a caste to people based on their last names as that knowledge has been lost.

"" remark.<p>I'm afraid I don't find it crazy. I think they deserve an enormous amount of the blame (as I hope I illustrated in my earlier replies) and frankly, I find it vaguely irritating that anyone would try to defend their actions with arguments revolving around caveat emptor.<p>This by no means suggests I believe they are solely responsible. On this, we can both agree. As far as I'm concerned, the ratings agencies, regulators (pre-crisis at least), brokers, press and government also deserve a large amount of the blame. Irresponsible consumers don't get let off the hook either.<p>However, regulators (at least on the European side of the Atlantic), government in general and consumers have spent the last 5 years learning from their mistakes and are at least making efforts to correct the situation. The big banks on the other hand have continued to take the piss virtually un-fazed. I'm hoping the LIBOR scandal will now be their watergate moment.<p>Edit: and when I say ""virtually un-fazed"" that's charitable. Active denial would be a better choice of phrase. They have heavily lobbied against every single banking sector reform proposed since the crisis began. That takes some hubris. I mean christ, in London up until fairly recently the banks were effectively resorting to blackmail: ""make these reforms and we'll have to quit the city and move our operations to a more 'enlightened' jurisdiction"".",1341791446

4216099,comment,4214521,4214980,3,0,einhverfr,,,"Well, in the community basically it is weighted towards early contributions (duh) but typically it is people who countribute well to the project in all levels.  The core committee has never had more than six people in it, and currently is down to three.  There have been some political issues that have come up with some nominees unfortunately so I won't say the process works perfectly.<p>However those who contribute well tend to get commit privileges and those who contribute to strategy beyond code have tended to become core members most of the time.<p>Also regarding management and leadership....  Management is typically a command and control structure for the leaders.  If you have a flat model, leadership becomes something different because you lack that command and control structure, and so does management.  Someone gets to make sure the machetes are sharp.  Maybe someone else is in charge of water....<p>But yeah good thoughts.<p>BTW, I don't think flat orgs work everywhere.  The companies that seem to be successful are those with a very narrow focus, like Github (building things around Git) and WL Gore, which builds things out of one, very specialized, form of plastic.  Flat orgs scale up to any number of employees, but they don't scale up to large numbers of goals.  I can't imagine how you'd have a flat org structure at Microsoft.  Well I can, but it wouldn't be all that flat and it certainly wouldn't be a single org....",1341791401
4216098,comment,4214767,4215714,10,0,davidcann,,,"I did freelancing (web, then iOS) for 8+ years based in the US, but for companies (large and small) around the world.  I rarely worked with companies in my local area.  The problem is thinking of the clients as ""employers"".<p>If you think of them as just clients and you have a lot of inbound leads (built up by word of mouth over time), then you can choose the projects that interest you.<p>In my experience, projects ranged from 6 weeks to 6+ months, but I almost always had multiple projects in various stages happening at the same time.  There were often a couple other freelancers on the project, coordinated by a project manager.  It's useful to work with or through a design agency or ""interactive"" agency (as they were called 10 years ago).  The key is to manage the entire project from start to finish for the client.  The worst problem is clients who don't deliver content/approvals/etc, so you need someone focused on bugging them.<p>I also usually set a per-project price, not hourly.  I hated tracking hours and it didn't give me the motivation to get stuff done faster.  A fixed price also forces everyone to agree on a detailed spec up front.  Add a little padding into your price, so you you can be kind about implementing the inevitable changes.<p>tldr; Yes, it's totally possible to make a living doing freelance development, all from home (or anywhere you want).",1341791399

BBC BASIC has a built-in assembler, e.g. 6502, Z80, or ARM, depending on the CPU it's running on.  The assembler source in the BASIC program is <i>not</i> tokenised on input but stored as plain text.  Instead, when those lines of BASIC, since that's what these embedded lines of assembler, wrapped in [...], are, get run the machine code is assembled at the address in BASIC's P% integer register variable and P% is moved on.

It's true that there are likely to be future problems with pensions, but they don't at all explain the current increases in tuition. Those are due to state funding cuts.<p>More specifically, if you take the total UC system budget and divide by the total student population, the result for 1990 (inflation-adjusted) was $21,000 spent per student. The result today is $16,500 spent per student.<p>Tuition has gone up anyway, because taxpayers stopped funding it faster than that rate of per-student cost decline. In 1990, state funding amounted to $16,000 per student (inflation-adjusted) out of the $21,000 total cost, leaving $5000 to be made up by tuition, donations, and other sources of income. Today the state contributes only $9,500 per student, and is in the process of cutting that to $8,500. So even with a more frugal $16,500-per-student cost, that now leaves $8000 to be funded out of non-state funds. So it's not surprising that tuition has gone up significantly.",1341789823

I've worked through tutorials, online classes and introductory texts.  Most of these things have you typing code in an editor, solving very minor problems, and seeing the results.  But there's a big gap between, say, typing a little program in an editor, and a full blown web page or game.

You have changed the topic and conflated several different issues - it is not the case that doing one thing wrong means doing everything wrong. There's a lot rotten in banking, but selling a bundle of mortgages with varying quality - without misrepresentation of this, and to another financial institutoion - is not morally or legally questionable.<p>If you really want to talk about the other issues, I find it highly unlikely that 'mis-selling' in this sense means lying. That implication is yet another easy way to join the narratives to sell papers. Small and medium business are generally protected in the same style as consumer purchases - they are not sophisticated investors, and should not even be sold complex products. When they complain about the consequences not being explained to them, they were in fact quite plain in the contract, but they didn't bother to read it properly, or did not understand it. I can understand why we protect them like this, however - same reasoning consumer purchases.<p>LIBOR - trying to manipulate the market is a crime. Actual effect? Maybe none? Previous investigations and a couple of academic papers found no effect. The Economist also considers the more important thing the 'second type' of wrongdoing - where the ire directed at Barclays is that they initially didn't lie, and then later lied less than everyone else (possible at the suggestion of the government?).<p>At the stage of 'not lying as much as others', it's getting pretty silly in my view. Much like the financial crisis's beginnings, the public is sold nonsense and hyperbole and cartoon villains. So we focus so heavily on the bankers that we don't really look into mortgage brokers, ratings agencies, government monetary policy, regulators, etc. Conclusion is to velify one group - exactly what the other groups want - without fixing those that set the wrong incentives/hold them accountable.

I can totally see why this is happening.<p>The design and layout of your blogs don't present you as the subject matter expert that you are. Blogging & blogging platfoms have changed a LOT over the last 10 years since you started some of your sites. Making your sites look professional will present your free work in the right light.<p>You're not making it easy for people to :-\n1)consume your writing & remember you\n2)know instantly what you're about & what your aims are \n3)move from post to post \n4)find specific posts relavent to them \n5)promote you, your newest work or product<p>I know it sounds shallow and that folks should just look through the formatting & design to find the value in your writing but if you're competing for attention and eyeballs with all the other sites out there, then the shine matters. Also you've got to consider some kickstarting some income streams that are both value to your customers and value for your time.<p>Just visit some of your favourite blogs and compare and contrast layout, style and design.<p>You've got a great body of work and I know you can start making the income you want from this.<p>I can see you're totally frustrated with how it's going so far. If I can help in any way or if you want to discuss this my e-mail is in my profile.",1341788617

Completely unnecessary and waste of 47MB.</i><p>While 47MB is indeed a bit large, storing vendor libraries alongside your code makes sure you have a working version when you pull down the repo. Nothing more frustrating than hunting down why the code you just checked out doesn&#x27;t work.<p><i>> Don&#x27;t commit your asset directories (they should be symlinks).</i><p>That depends on what you mean by assets. If there are binary assets needed for the app to run, they must be included. Imagine downloading a web app with all the icons and textures missing. Not good. And if source files exist for these assets, they should be in the repo, too (like PSDs or Inkscape SVGs)",1396346381

So you can sort the unidimensional array of items however you want, and then regenerate 2d positions based on that.<p>> On feature I (need) think is missing is the ability to freely place an item in the bottom-right side with gaps in between it and other items<p>You can&#x27;t right now without a few tweaks, but once we start accommodating for more options this will definitely be included. We have a certain <i>force</i> called &quot;pull to left&quot; that can be replaced with &quot;pull to top&quot; or just don&#x27;t pull, let the items be where they are placed, etc.<p>This was just our use-case, waiting for others to surface and see where this can go.",1396346004

An example of a function the lambda calculus cannot define is f(x, y) where the fastest computation of x and y wins. You&#x27;ll see that function pop up in a number of places in the Haskell world, where it is called &quot;amb&quot;. This function is obviously important from a pragmatic POV but it turns out it is also important when doing formal work as well: see the parallel-or/full abstraction problem for PCF[0].<p>My personal favorite concurrency formalism is the Chemical Abstract Machine[1].

We&#x27;d recovered from the dot com burst and I suddenly could see how this was going to work again. To use Gmail then you had to get an invite which was a bit of a problem. I asked around for days, if not weeks (can&#x27;t remember) and when I finally signed up, I also had invites to give away. I think there where 10. Later this was set to 100 and eventually I was removed all together.<p>Today Gmail is a bit of a shadow of it former glory, after the Google UX nazis got their hands on it I guess...",1396343752

The subtext that you&#x27;ve provided there, to people who do not identify as &quot;guys&quot;, is &#x27;I know you&#x27;re there, and I know that these words make some of you uneasy, but don&#x27;t worry, I didn&#x27;t mean to offend you, I just really really wanted to use these words anyway; I think they&#x27;re worth the risk of offending you&#x27;.<p>I know what you were trying to get at -- you want to make Hacker News a better place for /everyone/.  (And thanks for that!)  I&#x27;m sure you didn&#x27;t intend that meaning to non-guys, and I totally understand how that came about.  But, given that, I think that you might want to edit those words.  Can I recommend the usage of &quot;you all&quot;, or if you want to be more colloquial, &quot;you folks&quot;?",1396343748

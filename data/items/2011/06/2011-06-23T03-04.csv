I came to the stage where I started to look into available payment options and was surprised to see how broken it is. There are no payment gateways which offer recurring payments, TDR is so high that it is almost impossible to do small payments, websites of all the payment gateways sucks badly.<p>This is my first experience with online payments. I am really still wondering why it is so much broken and probably this is the reason why small web applications are not coming out of India ? Or because there are not many developers who build such applications that these payment gateways don't care at all about them.<p>I really want to hear back from fellow hackers with similar experiences.",1308801308

I think it comes mainly from the new generation of programmers who have not been programming for that long or have not worked on hard enough problems were the language makes very little difference. After having to work on a really hard problem it should hopefully become apparent that what really matters is the algorithm, not the language it is written on. Being obsessed with a language because it saves you a couple of seconds with its unique syntax is frankly quite silly. What takes most of the time is the actual design and figuring out of the algorithms involved. Also debugging takes quite some time. The actual programming shouldn't take that long. A couple of seconds saved because of some syntax will not make an iota of a difference.",1308801183

It is a 3 step process and it is not an easy one.Some times the process can last  more than 5 hours .it was one of the nervous moments of my life. To get a visa extension every 2 years I need to provide a letter from my employer ,tax documents and the last 3 pay stubs. Although, I have every document my visa could be rejected for no reason or sent for an audit or RFI(Request for more Info).This process can take around 2-3 months with re- submissions and RFIs.The Visa extension process became more rigorous in Obama's administration. The bar has been set really high which is good.some of my friends did not get an extension and so they had to leave the country .The petition fee has been hiked to $5000 from $1800 with an extra $1500 for the attorney's fee.Very few employers are willing to sponsor a work permit ,Hardly any one is willing sponsor a GC in this economy.Even if they are willing ,the backlog is almost 6 years.so if I apply now there is a chance I might get a GC in 2017.The bottom line is, I don't support illegal immigration of any kind.Immigration should be based on qualification .Although,what kind qualification is debatable .Thats a different story.If you guys are empathetic to illegal immigrants go look at the US consulates across the world where thousands of people stand every day to get an ""Approved"" stamp on their passports.",1308800206

Symbian seems hopelessly out of date, but it's also very frugal, which allows Nokia to cram a lot of functionality onto very cheap hardware.<p>If you look at the market from the bottom up rather than the top down, you see what MeeGo is for. It's not there to take on the likes of Android and iOS, that's why Nokia have gone WP7 for that market. It's designed as an aspirational upgrade for S60 users. That's prime territory, for a number of reasons.<p>Nokia are the only non-Shanzai manufacturer to really understand developing markets. The Nokia 1100 isn't just the biggest selling mobile phone ever, it's the biggest selling consumer electronics device, having sold over 250m units. The killer features of that handset are a really bright torch, a dustproof keypad and 400 hours of battery life.<p>The N9 hardware is outdated by design. The Cortex A8 that powers it is a relatively very cheap part. The N9 is a high-end handset in other respects, but that is entirely consistent with Nokia's model. Expect to see a feature-stripped version of the N9 shortly, with a plastic chassis, cheap LCD, basic camera and so on. The early adopters pay for the R&D, allowing Nokia to launch the cheap version at a killer price. Look at the E71 and E63 for an example of this in action.<p>Nokia are playing a much cleverer long game than anyone gives them credit for. They have more brand equity than all other handset manufacturers combined, albeit mainly amongst very poor customers. Nokia's future success won't be found by beating Apple, it will be found by beating the Shanzai boys.",1308800043

There are stories that didn't even make it into the slides. Many you could blame on us. Some we could blame on EC2. However, strong benefits to using MongoDB over PgSQL never materialized, so we opted to switch to a system with far fewer unknowns for our fairly modest needs.<p>If you think fully utilizing MongoDB's architecture will give your business a competitive advantage: go nuts.

Do you know the shit LEGAL immigrants have to go through to get and stay here? What makes you so damn special to skip the fucking line? I waited 7 fucking years for my greencard - all the while working and paying more taxes than you and any goddamn teabagger alive. I was stuck in h1B hell as a modern day indentured servant. I actually gave up and decided to go back home. I decided that America wasn't a place where hardworkers who followed the rules could make it. I told myself that as soon as I finished grad school, which I was putting myself through part time, I was out of here. Fuck this. Then it happened. Some fucked up debacle in 2007 at immigration where the waiting lists all became ""current"" for a month. I yelled at the company lawyer to get my shit done and ran around getting all my docs. 90 days later, I had a greencard. Things changed. I could do shit. I applied to techstars in Boulder in 2008 with my idea for syncing browsing sessions between desktop and mobile (I got rejected - David Cohen told me it was too easy to knock off and too hard to make money. He was right. I couldn't execute anyway, and then instapaper showed up like a month later anyway).<p>You think I have sympathy for you, Vargas? I married my wife, who was on H1B while I was on Greencard. She got laid off. Were we permitted to live together as a family in the USA? Nope. Even though she'd been here close to 10 years herself - doing grad school and then working. Yes, legally, and paying taxes all the long. You would think America would try to make it easy for english speaking, educated (in the US, no less), LEGAL immigrants who waited in line. Nope. Our son was even born in America. Proof to all the stupid republicans and teabaggers that there's no such thing as ""anchor babies"", not like we gave a fuck about that. Kids can't sponsor their parents till 21 years of age. So my wife and son had to go to Canada, to live with my parents, while I sorted shit out. I'm sponsoring her - but the waiting list is fucking what, 4 years long?!! Ya, the short wait times for sponsoring a spouse only applied to citizens. I have to wait till sept 2012 before I can apply for that. Jesus christ. America rocks. So now my wife visits on a vistor visa, with our American son, good for only 3 months at a time. Each time she's interrogated for an hour when she crosses the border because of this fucked up situation (US immigration are supposed to keep out visitors who they think are trying to live in america). She's been warned to not push it and not to come back too often. This is fucked up. I'm ready to fucking give up if it wasn't for all the shit we've been through to get here. I've always got my eye on potential opportunities back in Canada or abroad. I've got a good gig here that I actually like, but fuck, is it worth all the hurdles and bool shit of being separated from family and crossing borders every other weekend? Just to be LEGAL? My wife could have stayed here illegally. But we're not like that. We followed the fucking law and basically got fucked. So screw off vargas. No tears for you.",1308798918

But in software development documentation is not seen as a glamorous task, even though we all know that good documentation makes for a better product.<p>>Asking others that it gets done, provided you have the authority to do so, isn't actually initiative<p>Sure, I agree with you.<p>>I will ask the other two to get the documentation done, even though we are peers.<p>What if this was an open source project? Or a school project, or any project where you weren't reimbursed somehow. I like to look to these examples to see how a 'natural' system would develop, because it's too easy to place false systems on a business structure where you use payment to get people do what you want. If you can use a naturally-occuring system, it would seem that any project model would then thrive naturally. Hope I am making sense here.<p>>if you are working on a regular programming project, and a module requires more work than the others, who was more likely to pick it?<p>Well, that depends on the project goals, and I'd be making too many (more) assumptions here if I were to give examples of what I thought might happen in theory. Ultimately it's up to the individual.",1308798498

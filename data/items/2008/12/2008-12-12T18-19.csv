However, if the bailout is able to keep everyone in $70,000 other jobs for a year, that might be a <i>better</i> deal, even if it just means postponing the inevitable.  I recognize that this is very complex, one should account for e.g. if the economy will be recovered in a year, and more able to take the hit of these industries going under, how much more value the workers might produce in new jobs, etc.  It's beyond me to calculate, but I would love to see an analysis that presupposes that this is straightforward charity for those workers, and how to get the best bang for our redistributive buck.",1229108125

Moreso than the messages 'smoking kills' or 'you shouldn't smoke', they emphasize the message 'tobacco companies/executives are <i>evil</i>'.<p>That's always seemed to be an unfair use of public funds for nasty politics, to me. (The ads are a lot like election campaign hit pieces.)<p>I wonder if by blaming third parties for smoking, rather than individual decisions, it subtly enables smokers to avoid making a healthy personal choice. It also fortifies the self-righteousness of anti-smoking crusaders: ""we good, they evil, ugh! ugh! ugh!""",1229107737

We tried to keep the extensions very simple, so there would be as little to port and keep synchronized between versions.  Both platforms were relatively new to us, but I don't think we were stupid.<p>The IE plugin was about 300 times more work.  Seriously, people have asked me about this a lot, and that's a pretty accurate judgment of the relative workload.<p>Also, it's shockingly hard to find a competent COM+ developer, and the IE extension docs are actually worse than the Firefox docs, though both leave a lot to be desired.<p>In general, installing an extension is a pretty huge barrier; don't expect users who aren't already familiar with your service to bother installing one just to try it.",1229106979

Assume you have a ""twin paradox"" situation. One twin stays on earth for a year, while the other twin goes somewhere far away in space and returns, in relatvistic speed. The travelling twin accelerates smoothly in his journey.
Given the twin's trajectory, the mission is to calculate in how many years he has grown old.
Do you think that SR can't handle this case?<p>Second question.
Observe the Lienard-Wiechert potentials. They say the exact value of the EM field at any given point. What is the significance of the value of the field E, if not the chrage of the body times the force that acts on it? If it does mean that, then ""force"" in which context, if not SR? Newtonian? GR?",1229105639

(This is pre-MacOS X, which placed the application's name next to the Apple icon.)

They must make their mobile app flawless and reliable, because if only a couple of users out of hundreds of millions publicly criticize their app, this hurts their reputation badly.<p>I do not agree with what most people are saying. HTML5, CSS, Javascript are already good enough standards for 99% of all apps.<p>The real problem lies with the popular mobile browsers. Anybody who ever tried developing a rich interface for Mobile Safari and for Android knows just how bad things are - and some people think having to support IExplorer 6 was painful.<p>Also, at least on iOS, the browser has better performance than a WebUI embedded in an app. From what I know the web component doesn't use the same Javascript engine for instance. Also, not sure if this changed, but on iOS 4 you couldn't upload files from the mobile browser (file fields in forms were deactivated). You also couldn't automatically place the focus on a form field, to force the keyboard to pop, because you couldn't trigger any mouse/keyboard event other than in response to a physical user action (I think this was a problem with mobile WebKit in general).

There's no doubt that it's cheaper in the long run, even with costs related to programming, testing, maintenance, and tweaking. But rushing untested robotics into production will almost certainly increase the costs above manual labor. It's better to maintain the current line while you test out the automation, gradually train workers to monitor systems, and switch over one line at a time. This particular story (painting dots) seems like a great case for automation, so I'd suspect they're working on it.<p>Also keep in mind that sometimes, manual labor trumps robotics. Let's say there will be 70 million of these backplates shipped, and then no more will be needed. That's a lot of automation investment in a solution for a temporary product. Workers can move from one task to the next with ease, while robotics require a lot of development, logistics, and testing. For a company like Foxconn that will always be manufacturing different things, the investment in human labor might allow for more ""pivoting"" than robotics.

Work less, eat better, sleep more, enjoy your life more, stress less, change your life, live healthier, enjoy enough daylight, and first make sure that you are not infact surrounded by assholes & idiots. 
Try sports, fall in love, try dietary suplements, vitamins, make some major life changes, stop smoking, stop drinking, stop making yourself depressed all the time.

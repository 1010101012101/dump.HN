35290,comment,35015,35283,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Well, if they said yes to that, they'd have equity in a huge number of companies too. ;-)<p>But yeah, I can understand why they didn't go for it.  It's turned out that yCombinator partner time is the scarcest resource in the Founders Programs.  It makes sense to concentrate that where it's most likely to have the most effect, in the accepted founders.  Which unfortunately doesn't include me.<p>This was for the first funding cycle though: at the time, nearly everyone harped on the money and not on the fringe benefits.  Maybe Graham et al knew that partner bandwidth would be scarce, but I thought I was being clever by going for the part I really needed and offering to give up the part that didn't matter so much to me.",1184858525

However, WIPO applications are typically obtained in addition to separate U.S. and International patents rather than instead of, so it doesn't really serve the intended purpose.",1184858303

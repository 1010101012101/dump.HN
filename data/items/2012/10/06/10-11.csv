I've used gems to provide it since I don't trust myself to write good enough security algorithms (and really, why reinvent the wheel if I don't have to).<p>In .net we can use the asp.net membership.

If you do not cling to a specific identity, then it frees you to empathize with a wide range of people. If you say ""I am white/asian/tall/rich"", then it forms an in-group vs out-group mentality, and obstructs empathy.<p>For example, does it strike you odd that any land should be deemed ""discovered"" when there are already inhabiting humans there?",1349518472

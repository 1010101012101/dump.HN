They raised money for the dev kit and guess what? The people you chipped in got their dev kits.<p>As far as I can see, people got exactly out of the kickstarter campaign what they wanted. They helped to start the business of Oculus and in return even got the DevKit to experience the first results on the road to VR.<p>I hardly think just cause you started your business with a kickstarter campaign and gave the backers what you set out to give them should exempt you from ever getting acquired by another company somewhere down the road. If that were true, why go on kickstarter at all? That would basically mean you will always stay a small time player. If you can survive at all because you will have to do it all by yourself. Next thing you know, kickstarter backers demand that you also don&#x27;t accept other investors money because then, these investors would also have a say how to do things.",1395824270

Imagine all the possibilities. I have seen a project displaying the picture from the front cameras in HDR mode. Therefore, making reality looking better that it really did.

For the purpose of section 167 the estimated useful life of an asset is not necessarily the useful life inherent in the asset but is the period over which the asset may reasonably be expected to be useful to the taxpayer in his trade or business or in the production of his income. This period shall be determined by reference to his experience with similar property taking into account present conditions and probable future developments. Some of the factors to be considered in determining this period are (1) wear and tear and decay or decline from natural causes, (2) the normal progress of the art, economic changes, inventions, and current developments within the industry and the taxpayer&#x27;s trade or business, (3) the climatic and other local conditions peculiar to the taxpayer&#x27;s trade or business, and (4) the taxpayer&#x27;s policy as to repairs, renewals, and replacements. Salvage value is not a factor for the purpose of determining useful life. If the taxpayer&#x27;s experience is inadequate, the general experience in the industry may be used until such time as the taxpayer&#x27;s own experience forms an adequate basis for making the determination. The estimated remaining useful life may be subject to modification by reason of conditions known to exist at the end of the taxable year and shall be redetermined when necessary regardless of the method of computing depreciation. However, estimated remaining useful life shall be redetermined only when the change in the useful life is significant and there is a clear and convincing basis for the redetermination.</i>",1395822453

All features are in our community projects like Fedora or JBoss Wildfly, these features might be a mix of whatever is the latest and greatest that people want as well as all the normal bits that you&#x27;d expect. When we make an enterprise ready product out of these community projects like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or JBoss Enterprise Application Server (EAP) our focus is actually on stability and longevity, in other words something that we can stand behind and support for up to 10 years or more! So we actually remove or don&#x27;t pull in features from the project that aren&#x27;t ready yet (which we know because we employ a lot of the professional engineers that are committers). We then have a rigorous testing process before releasing these enterprise ready products to our subscribers. One of the key bits that people don&#x27;t understand is that once we release an enterprise product we will then back port from the latest and greatest community version all security and bug fixes for the supported life of the enterprise product.<p>Two things to note about this, the enterprise versions are open source as well and we follow an upstream first approach so bug fixes and security patches are applied to the upstream version as well as to the stable enterprise version so upstream has all the latest fixes BUT it also has all the latest features and changes so it&#x27;s more like our R&D version that you can play with and do some development on but wouldn&#x27;t be something we would stand behind for production environments.<p>I wanted to point this out as this is fundamentally different from the open core model you describe and which I seriously object to as an approach because it still locks you into the vendor who is selling you the extra bits.<p>> The first wave of open source leaders, including Red Hat, relied almost entirely on the community to build their products.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this statement is entirely true, Red Hat has been a top committer to the Linux kernel and to the JBoss projects for many many years and in fact around half of our company are professional engineers working on open source projects!",1395821560

For example, what if your VR headset displays information consumed from a set of stereoscopic cameras?<p>There would be a lot of complications. (Won&#x27;t the other guy also be wearing a VR headset, thus obscuring the cameras? Though not necessarily if it&#x27;s one-directional)<p>Imagine a VR conversation with another person who&#x27;s in front of a stereo camera. You can&#x27;t move your headset much, but you can tilt and pan slightly - basically stay in place and move your head. Imagine combining the VR technology with 3d scene reconstruction such as: <a href=""http://petapixel.com/2013/07/24/researchers-reconstruct-highly-accurate-3d-scenes-using-high-res-photos/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://petapixel.com/2013/07/24/researchers-reconstruct-high...</a> - performed in realtime using the stereo camera.

I deeply respect them, and think that they probably have more appropriate tech to offer than most, but I think that one of the most important parts of virtual worlds is Second Life&#x27;s original killer feature - content creation, which is something they have little experience in.<p>The ability for anyone to create is powerful, as recent games like minecraft have shown. Second Life just never kept up with technology, and now the best ways to create content for it involve the use of modeling software with a high barrier to entry. (Of course, it&#x27;s terrible in many other ways, but that&#x27;s a separate discussion).<p>If someone can build a virtual world platform from the ground up, with tightly integrated content creation that is intuitive (maybe something like sketchup), and all in-world, it would be very powerful.<p>I&#x27;ve actually been wanting to build just such a platform for a long time, but learning 3d graphics isn&#x27;t the easiest thing out there :)",1395820855

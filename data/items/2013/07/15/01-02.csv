6043219,comment,6040777,6042052,15,0,graycat,,,"> This idea that researchers should be teaching is just horrible, they&#x27;re not significantly overlapping skill sets.<p>It would seem so, but you have to be careful\nbecause too frequently the claim is badly false.\nLet&#x27;s consider courses in your college major\nfrom junior year or later (and there can be other\ncases, e.g., for advanced students who get into\nserious material before their junior year).\nReasons:<p>(1) It&#x27;s a big, often bad world out there\nwith a lot of dumb, badly adjusted,\nsick, injured, confused people.  One way\nacademics <i>filters</i> whom they let teach is by insisting\non some research accomplishments.<p>(2) To do a good job teaching (in your major,\njunior level or higher) there can be\nchallenges in understanding the material\nreally well, that is, the details, done\nwell, an overview, balance, judgment,\n<i>synthesis</i>, bigger picture, important\nconnections with other parts of your\nmajor, applications, research, etc.\nSo, for this level of understanding,\nit can be important for you to have the\nbrightest, most knowledgeable prof\nyou can get.  That is, a less\nbright, less knowledgeable prof\nmay not have such understanding\nthemselves.<p>(3) One thing, on a good day, you \nmight get in a classroom,\nface to face with a good prof is \nan example of <i>how he thinks</i>.  There&#x27;s\na lot of junk that can find its way\ninto thinking; it can be a real surprise\nto see, from a really bright prof,\nhow he manages to filter out all the\njunk, set aside the not very\ngood content, and keep the best \ncontent.  Once as a graduate student \nI heard a lecture \nby S. Eilenberg, and afterward\na junior prof said:  &quot;He sure doesn&#x27;t\nwaste time with little ideas.&quot;.  That\ncould be a good remark to hear.  You\ntypically won&#x27;t get good remarks of that\nkind from profs who are able to teach\nthe material but don&#x27;t bring a lot more\ninto the classroom.<p>(4) Actually, in some fields, starting at the junior\nyear, you can begin to notice that\n&quot;it&#x27;s a small world&quot;.  So, if you have a\ngood researcher as a prof, then you can\nbe surprisingly few connections from the\nbest people in the world in the field;\nnot good to miss out on that.<p>(5) Yes, it&#x27;s important to learn, but, really,\nfrom the junior year on in your major, there&#x27;s\noften some question about just what and how\nmuch you should learn.  Or, yes, in K-12 and\nthe first two years of college, the emphasis\nis on the student <i>learning</i>.  By the junior\nyear, the lesson, quite clear somewhere \nin a Ph.D. program and starting \nto become clear in the junior year, is that no one can\ncarry all the research library around between\ntheir ears.  So, a big question is, since\nyou will be learning only a tiny fraction\nof everything in the research library,\nwhat fraction should you learn?  One\npath to a good answer is to have a prof\nwho has, from his research, a good\nview of the future of the field\nand can use that view to help\nselect and weight what to present\nin the course.  That is, it&#x27;s easy\nto waste time on junk, trivia,\nless important material, dead end\ndetours, etc., and a prof who\ndoes much of that can&#x27;t be good\nat research.<p>(6) This stuff about bad teaching is not\na small problem.  Instead, it&#x27;s far too\neasy for academics to fall into some\nrigid nonsense such as in some of the\nstories about teaching in Asia --\nnose to the grindstone, shoulder to\nthe wheel, ear to the ground, dot all the\ni&#x27;s, cross all the t&#x27;s, but still don&#x27;t\nhave even a weak little hollow hint\nof a tiny clue what the material\nis about.  E.g., recently here on\nHN is a link to the famous Feynman\ndescription of teaching in a country\nin South America.  It&#x27;s too easy\nfor the nonsense Feynman described to walk in and\ntake over.  The peer-review process\nin the better journals tends to\ncut out that nonsense.<p>(7) In some majors, it can be important\nfor you to meet people, hopefully via\nyour coursework.  A good researcher\nwell known around the world might\ngive you some introductions that\ncould prove priceless.<p>There&#x27;s more:  Broadly a big issue is\nquality, and there&#x27;s no easy substitute.<p>One response, at one time common at Courant,\nis &quot;If you just want to learn the basic\nmaterial, then don&#x27;t bother with classes\nand, instead,\njust get some books\nand study.&quot;<p>At one time the Web site of the Princeton\nmath department said, (from memory, likely\nnot exactly correct):  &quot;The courses given\nare introductions to research by world class\nresearchers.  No courses are given for\npreparation for the qualifying exams.\nInstead, students are expected to\nteach themselves such material.&quot;.  So,\nby the junior year, a course should\nhave more to offer a student\nthan just the basic material\na good student could just get from\nthe books.<p>Education is about the future,\npreparing to do well in the future.\nAs from character Yoda\nin <i>Star Wars</i>, &quot;Always difficult\nto see, the future.&quot;.  Yup, he\nwas correct.  Good researchers\nhave some advantages in \nseeing what is more promising\nfor the future.",1373853409
6043218,comment,6042331,6042845,1,0,mjn,,,"Independent study credit is definitely worth looking into, if your college has such a possibility (most do).<p>However, as someone who supervises independent studies regularly, I can also say: independent studies are by <i>far</i> the classes most likely to result in the student just not doing anything at all, which to some extent shows why autodidacticism is not universal yet. In a traditional semester-long class with two-times-a-week meetings, it&#x27;s very rare for a student to literally do nothing. Most will show up at least some of the time, and do at least some of the work. But it&#x27;s easy to put off an independent study, because you have complete flexibility, and don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to do anything this week if other things are more pressing. Then you end up 90% of the way through the semester realizing you haven&#x27;t done anything.<p>Some very good stuff comes out of independent-study projects, but the variance is large, and it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. As a supervisor, they take a disproportionate amount of management effort, just trying to track students down and prod them into non-procrastination.",1373853394

You can just disable javascript, or remove the layer with Firebug.<p>Also, here&#x27;s the copy for anyone else fighting with it:<p>==========================================================<p>For decades, a so-called anti-propaganda law prevented the U.S. government&#x27;s mammoth broadcasting arm from delivering programming to American audiences. But on July 2, that came silently to an end with the implementation of a new reform passed in January. The result: an unleashing of thousands of hours per week of government-funded radio and TV programs for domestic U.S. consumption in a reform initially criticized as a green light for U.S. domestic propaganda efforts. So what just happened?<p>Until this month, a vast ocean of U.S. programming produced by the Broadcasting Board of Governors such as Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks could only be viewed or listened to at broadcast quality in foreign countries. The programming varies in tone and quality, but its breadth is vast: It&#x27;s viewed in more than 100 countries in 61 languages. The topics covered include human rights abuses in Iran; self-immolation in Tibet; human trafficking across Asia; and on-the-ground reporting in Egypt and Iraq.<p>The restriction of these broadcasts was due to the Smith-Mundt Act, a long standing piece of legislation that has been amended numerous times over the years, perhaps most consequentially by Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright. In the 70s, Fulbright was no friend of VOA and Radio Free Europe, and moved to restrict them from domestic distribution, saying they &quot;should be given the opportunity to take their rightful place in the graveyard of Cold War relics.&quot; Fulbright&#x27;s amendment to Smith-Mundt was bolstered in 1985 by Nebraska Senator Edward Zorinsky who argued that such &quot;propaganda&quot; should be kept out of America as to distinguish the U.S. &quot;from the Soviet Union where domestic propaganda is a principal government activity.&quot;<p>Zorinsky and Fulbright sold their amendments on sensible rhetoric: American taxpayers shouldn&#x27;t be funding propaganda for American audiences. So did Congress just tear down the American public&#x27;s last defense against domestic propaganda?<p>BBG spokeswoman Lynne Weil insists BBG is not a propaganda outlet, and its flagship services such as VOA &quot;present fair and accurate news.&quot;<p>&quot;They don&#x27;t shy away from stories that don&#x27;t shed the best light on the United States,&quot; she told The Cable. She pointed to the charters of VOA and RFE: &quot;Our journalists provide what many people cannot get locally: uncensored news, responsible, discussion, and open debate.&quot;<p>A former U.S. government source with knowledge of the BBG says the organization is no Pravda, but it does advance U.S. interests in more subtle ways. In Somalia, for instance, VOA serves as counterprogramming to outlets peddling anti-American or jihadist sentiment. &quot;Somalis have three options for news,&quot; the source said, &quot;word of mouth, Al-Shabaab or VOA Somalia.&quot;<p>This partially explains the push to allow BBG broadcasts on local radio stations in the United States. The agency wants to reach diaspora communities, such as St. Paul Minnesota&#x27;s significant Somali expat community. &quot;Those people can get Al-Shabaab, they can get Russia Today, but they couldn&#x27;t get access to their taxpayer-funded news sources like VOA Somalia,&quot; the source said. &quot;It was silly.&quot;<p>Lynne added that the reform has a transparency benefit as well. &quot;Now Americans will be able to know more about what they are paying for with their tax dollars - greater transparency is a win-win for all involved,&quot; she said. And so with that we have the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, which passed as part of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, and went into effect this month.<p>But if anyone needed a reminder of the dangers of domestic propaganda efforts, the past 12 months provided ample reasons. Last year, two USA Today journalists were ensnared in a propaganda campaign after reporting about millions of dollars in back taxes owed by the Pentagon&#x27;s top propaganda contractor in Afghanistan. Eventually, one of the co-owners of the firm confessed to creating phony websites and Twitter accounts to smear the journalists anonymously. Additionally, just this month, The Washington Post exposed a counter propaganda program by the Pentagon that recommended posting comments on a U.S. website run by a Somali expat with readers opposing Al-Shabaab. &quot;Today, the military is more focused on manipulating news and commentary on the Internet, especially social media, by posting material and images without necessarily claiming ownership,&quot; reported The Post.<p>But for BBG officials, the references to Pentagon propaganda efforts are nauseating, particularly because the Smith-Mundt Act never had anything to do with regulating the Pentagon, a fact that was misunderstood in media reports in the run-up to the passage of new Smith-Mundt reforms in January.<p>One example included a report by the late Buzzfeed reporter Michael Hastings, who suggested that the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act would open the door to Pentagon propaganda of U.S. audiences. In fact, as amended in 1987, the act only covers portions of the State Department engaged in public diplomacy abroad (i.e. the public diplomacy section of the &quot;R&quot; bureau, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors.)<p>But the news circulated regardless, much to the displeasure of Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), a sponsor of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012. &quot;To me, it&#x27;s a fascinating case study in how one blogger was pretty sloppy, not understanding the issue and then it got picked up by Politico&#x27;s Playbook, and you had one level of sloppiness on top of another,&quot; Thornberry told The Cable last May. &quot;And once something sensational gets out there, it just spreads like wildfire.&quot;<p>That of course doesn&#x27;t leave the BBG off the hook if its content smacks of agitprop. But now that its materials are allowed to be broadcast by local radio stations and TV networks, they won&#x27;t be a complete mystery to Americans. &quot;Previously, the legislation had the effect of clouding and hiding this stuff,&quot; the former U.S. official told The Cable. &quot;Now we&#x27;ll have a better sense: Gee some of this stuff is really good. Or gee some of this stuff is really bad. At least we&#x27;ll know now.&quot;",1373851384

The first was my knowledge as a mathematically-inclined software engineer.  The second was my knowledge as someone fluent in high-level mathematics.<p>I&#x27;ll say, here was one key to my understanding once I saw it.  In a purely functional language you want everything to be referentially transparent.  That is, an expression should be able to be substituted for its value at any given moment in time.  At the very least, you&#x27;ll want the ability to denote which parts of your program are referentially transparent and which aren&#x27;t.<p>This can be expressed as utopian vision: in a purely functional language we&#x27;d like everything -- <i>everything</i> -- to be a value.<p>We now need some way of translating code with side effects into code that returns a value.  The logical abstraction is to say that the &quot;value&quot; is not the work itself -- once the work is done it&#x27;s out of the bag, after all -- but rather the &quot;value&quot; is the machine which can perform that work.<p>To a mathematician this screams &quot;functor.&quot;  If you want to move between the two spaces repeatedly this screams &quot;adjoint functors.&quot;  There&#x27;s some work you want to do in Space A that&#x27;s more easily expressed in Space B, so you take a thing in A, transform it to a thing in B, do the work in B, and then transform back to A.<p>Think in, e.g., Ruby:<p><pre><code>    sentence.split(&#x27; &#x27;).map(&:reverse).join(&#x27; &#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nsplit(&#x27; &#x27;) and join(&#x27; &#x27;) aren&#x27;t quite inverses of each other, but they are adjoint.  These pairs take us from the land of space-separated strings to the land of arrays back to the land of space separated strings.<p>You see that all the time in programming and mathematics.  I sometimes call it the &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; maneuver when I&#x27;m trying to teach it to students.  Mario wants to get to the end of the level, so he hits a block, goes up the vine to cloud land, runs through cloud land, and then comes back down.",1373850681

As an autodidact, I can just not do it because I am tired, busy, not in the mood, or whatever.<p>The second thing that college grads don&#x27;t get the value of is that they are able to learn by some proven path. This path is not etched out so well and requires considerable research, self-assessment, and decisions that aren&#x27;t comfortable at all times. You could spend weeks a) researching what is next and b) attempting things you aren&#x27;t ready for and blowing off a few weeks on something you gained nothing from because that knowledge base just wasn&#x27;t there.<p>There are many other little things you learn in college that are at times quite difficult to learn about on your own. Despite the apparent &quot;free&quot; education, nothing is free and there are things that you simply cannot learn or discover on your own. Guidance, whether from an instructor or a mentor, is very important when you are learning. Trust me, I&#x27;d gladly shovel out money for good guidance.<p>You also live a lonely life and there is no one you can call up who is also struggling or trade information with.<p>There is no way to really test yourself so you know you are correct and where you went wrong. Self-testing is either very hard or impossible in many instances, and that little epiphany you get from a red circle isn&#x27;t available for you. It takes a certain amount of brutal honesty to get it right, and then you still don&#x27;t always know. This is frustrating for me.<p>The final piece is the double-edged sword of readiness. As a grad, you have proved to someone or some institution that you have mastered the material and are ready to work, whereas when you are an autodidact, you simply won&#x27;t have the confidence to face an interviewer unless you are something like 10x better than any bachelor-holder, and sometimes masters-holder, that walks through the door.

In fact, I don&#x27;t see how someone who doesn&#x27;t know Haskell could possibly understand the above truly. unCompose isn&#x27;t even ever used.",1373850498

Lenders sign up on our website, fund their accounts with BTC and they decide who to lend to, at what interest rate and how much to fund loans for. BitLendingClub does not perform any funding itself.<p>Bitcoin lending, and Bitcoin in general, don&#x27;t fall under any particular state/country&#x27;s regulatory jurisdiction. As such, it&#x27;s not necessary for us to register with any regulators as long as we don&#x27;t facilitate lending of some state currency, such as USD, EUR, GBP, etc. I live and operate this website from Chicago, IL, but based on the current statements from the government and since we only allow lending with Bitcoins, it doesn&#x27;t seem like we have to comply with any specific lending regulations within Illinois or the states.<p>I&#x27;ve updated the company page to include the corporate information:<p>BitLendingClub is owned by Tanager, Inc registered in the State of Illinois in October 08, 2009.\nFile number: 66992225 \nName registered under: Kiril Gantchev\nAddress registered under (residential):\n217 N.

I live and work in Chicago, IL and a cursory search in google will confirm all of that information. Both of us are software developers, so we don&#x27;t have particular experience in loans, but we hope that the key aspect we&#x27;re going to resolve is providing the platform where people with experience in lending can conduct lending.<p>The T&C is empty because we&#x27;re still in Beta and we were more focused on the functionality rather than the content.

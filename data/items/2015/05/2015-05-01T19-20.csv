9474064,comment,9472848,9473518,0,0,tzs,,,"Cold fusion is a bit more complicated than that. The early experiments were certainly flawed, and there were way to many people announcing results for publicity before they had checked their work.<p>After a few years, it was no longer socially acceptable for respected scientists to work on cold fusion. It didn&#x27;t matter anymore how good your reputation was as a researcher, or how carefully designed your experiment was--if your research was in cold fusion, it would get largely ignored.<p>Unfortunately, this happened around the time a couple groups of respected researchers with good experiment design were getting interesting results pointing to real new phenomena, and perhaps explaining why prior results had been so erratic.<p>David Goodstein around this time wrote a great article [1] looking back at cold fusion, which included a discussion of these later results, and how socially science had reached a state where they could not be considered. Here are the last few paragraphs.<p><pre><code>    All of this was much less important than the fact
    that Cold Fusion experiments, if they gave positive
    results at all, gave them only sporadically and
    unpredictably. When Bednorz and Mueller announced
    the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity
    in 1986, no one carped about control experiments,
    because, once the recipe was known, any competent
    scientist could make a sample and test it and it
    would work immediately. If, at their press
    conference, Pons and Fleischmann had given a
    dependable recipe for producing excess heat, they
    very likely would be Nobel Prizewinners now (as
    Bednorz and Mueller are) rather than social outcasts
    from the community of scientists. The essential key
    to the return of Cold Fusion to scientific
    respectability is to find the missing ingredient
    that would make the recipe work every time.

    Experiments done in the U.S. and in Japan, and
    reported at the Maui meeting indicate that the
    missing ingredient may have been found. In all the
    various Cold Fusion experiments, the first step is
    to load deuterium into the body of metallic
    palladium. The issue is how much deuterium gets into
    the metal. The ratio of the number of atoms of
    deuterium in the metal to the number of atoms of
    palladium is called x. It turns out, by means of
    electrolysis, or by putting the metal in deuterium
    gas, that it is rather easy to get x up to the range
    of about 0.6 or 0.7. That is already a startlingly
    high figure. If there are almost as many deuterium
    atoms as palladium atoms in the material, the
    density of deuterium (a form of hydrogen) is
    essentially equal to that of liquid hydrogen rocket
    fuel, which can ordinarily exist only at extreme low
    temperatures. In other words, palladium (and certain
    other metals including titanium) soak up almost
    unbelievable amounts of hydrogen or deuterium if
    given the chance. This is far from a new discovery.
    However, according to the experiments reported at
    Maui, x=0.6 or 0.7 is not enough to produce Cold
    Fusion. Both the American and Japanese groups showed
    data indicating there is a sharp threshold at
    x=0.85. Below that value (which can only be reached
    with great difficulty and under favorable
    circumstances) excess heat is never observed. But,
    once x gets above that value, excess heat is
    essentially always observed, according to the
    reports presented at Maui, and recounted by Franco
    Scaramuzzi in his seminar at the University of Rome.

    The audience at Rome, certainly the senior
    professors who were present, listened politely, but
    they did not hear what Franco was saying (that much
    became clear from the questions that were asked at
    the end of the seminar, and comments that were made
    afterward). If they went away with any lasting
    impression at all, it was just the sad realization
    that a fine scientist like Franco had not yet given
    up his obsession with Cold Fusion. They cannot be
    blamed. Any other audience of mainstream scientists
    would have reacted exactly the same way. If Cold
    Fusion ever gains back the scientific respectability
    that was squandered in March and April of 1989, it
    will be the result of a long, difficult battle that
    has barely begun.

    Recently, I told this story in a Philosophy course
    we teach at Caltech called &quot;Ethics of Research.&quot; The
    first question, when I finished my tale, was, do I
    believe in Cold Fusion? The answer is, no.
    Certainly, I believe quite firmly the theoretical
    arguments that say Cold Fusion is impossible. On the
    other hand, however, I believe equally firmly in the
    integrity and competence of Franco Scaramuzzi and
    his group of co-workers at Frascati. I was disturbed
    when I saw that Franco had gotten caught in the web
    of science-by-news conference in April 1989
    (although I was truly pleased that he finally got
    the long overdue recognition his agency ENEA owed
    him), and I was even more distressed when I learned
    that Franco and his group had observed excess heat
    (the &quot;bad kind&quot; of Cold Fusion). However, I have
    looked at their cells, and looked at their data, and
    it&#x27;s all pretty impressive. The Japanese experiment
    showing that heat nearly always results when x is
    greater than 0.85 looks even more impressive on
    paper. It seems a particularly elegant, well
    designed experiment, at least to the untutored eye
    of a physicist (what do I know about
    electrochemistry?) What all these experiments really
    need is critical examination by accomplished rivals
    intent on proving them wrong. That is part of the
    normal functioning of science. Unfortunately, in
    this area, science is not functioning normally.
    There is nobody out there listening.

    I suppose that, if nuclear fusion really does take
    place whenever x is greater than 0.85 in palladium,
    the world of conventional science will eventually be
    forced to take notice. If not, then the whole story
    I have told you is nothing but a curious footnote to
    a bizarre and ugly episode in the history of
    science. Either way, I think the story illuminates
    the inner dynamics of the scientific enterprise in a
    way that few other stories have done. For that
    reason alone, it may be worth telling.

High-Tc might have been &quot;impossible&quot; under basic BCS superconductivity theory, but BCS theory itself taught us that it was possible to find novel theoretical mechanisms generating zero resistance, so needing a new one was surprising but not unprecedented. &quot;Standard&quot; low-Tc superconductivity appeared &quot;impossible&quot; under the usual models of materials&#x27; resistivity, but even that was merely a violation of a well-tested model when it was extended to a previously untested very-low-temperature regime.

Some game engines have taken to implementing a second language runtime, for example Minetest and MC-Server are written in C++ but allow addon development in Lua. The Minecraft modifications ComputerCraft and OpenComputers also allow in-game programming using Lua. ScriptCraft, a CanaryMod plugin for Minecraft, allows writing plugins in JavaScript. etc. But when everything is written in JavaScript, there is no platform/addon dichotomy.

That would be bad for the world.<p>Predicting where the future &quot;is&quot;, if there is such a place, is harder.<p>In 1975, I think that the concentration of investment made sense because it followed the same principle as academia: smart people want to stick together, and smart people with esoteric specialties usually want to be near others in the same specialty.<p>Now, the model of a large city is taking over. Smart people want to <i>be around</i> a heterogeneous set of smart people, and use the Internet and conferences for in-specialty interactions. So New York and Chicago and even Boston are more compelling. People just go to the Bay Area to make money. No one under 40 wants to be there (and almost no one over 40 can afford to be there) because, while the talent level is high, it&#x27;s monoculture.<p>In 2015, the Valley makes a lot less sense when you consider what people are building out there. It&#x27;s not technical excellence any more. Marketing experiments using technology have driven out actual technology, the latter being too long term to gel with two-week &quot;iterations&quot; and an age discrimination culture that (stupidly) discards people just around the time when they start to develop a deep expertise.<p>The 2015 Valley story is different. What we have is a lot of passive capital tied up in pension funds and retirement accounts, and some sliver of it gets thrown into higher-risk asset classes like VC firms. The passive capitalists, above all, want the highest returns on their investment. They&#x27;d probably also prefer (as a tie-breaker) that the jobs be created locally (i.e., in Ohio if it&#x27;s an Ohio state employee pension fund) rather than in California... but if the returns were better in CA, they&#x27;d want their money put there.<p>VC has become a conveyer belt that sucks up a huge amount of passive capital from all over the country and funnels it into a few people in Northern California. This would be defensible <i>if</i> VC were a high-performing asset class. The problem is that it&#x27;s not. It works very well for the careers of a few hundred very well connected people, but the passive investors get shitty returns and the engineers building the stuff are lucky to get 0.01%.",1430507786

It&#x27;s a medium designed for soundbites instead of consideration and &quot;wit&quot;[1] instead of intelligence.  His go-to explanation is that the limitations force people to be concise and choose their words carefully. Either he&#x27;s rationalizing or he&#x27;s extremely naive about the quality of discourse on the Internet.<p>[1] I mean that in the most negative way possible.  &quot;Perceived wit&quot; might be a better term to use here: I&#x27;ve often seen things like pleasing sentence structure used to cover a lack of veracity, a la &quot;If you&#x27;re not part of the solution, you&#x27;re part of the problem&quot;. or &quot;YesAllWomen&quot;.  While not inherently incorrect, I&#x27;ve seen both of those used a massive number of times in situations where they&#x27;re entirely irrelevant or inaccurate.

Companies like Apple and Facebook look at Google&#x27;s attempts at compromising product quality for openness[1] (which, to be clear, is a trade-off that I personally think is worth the benefits to the ecosystem) and the huge backlash they get when they finally throw in the towel long after the battle is lost (s2s federation was more or less irrelevant by the time they removed it because the vast majority of chat usage was on walled gardens).

Those last two things are recognized via a verbatim regex (basically /^I have come from a German network address$/),<p>and the actual implementation code does something based on that, say, setting a test IP to a known German netblock, and the last line would actually load the site and look for the right localized strings.<p>So they&#x27;re rather closely coupled together.

Join me to solve the childcare problem before my church kicks me out",,"Hello hn, my name is David Code (seriously), and I&#x27;m a priest trying to solve a deep social problem with technology. My background and my project&#x27;s background is in the letter below, that I&#x27;m emailing out this afternoon. My church leadership has rejected this project, and me along with it, and my resources are drying up. This is all or nothing, and I&#x27;m taking the jump - am interested in any advice or connections you&#x27;ve got.  
Sorry to intrude, but grateful for your help.  David<p>Dear [parent]
Finding childcare is a severe pain point for many parents.  I’m thrilled that my team and I have created an app to solve this chronic problem.  Our prototype is now ready for parents to beta test--it’s called ParentVillage (www.joinparentvillage.com ).<p>But, to be honest, I’m very scared.  My Episcopal church leadership has rejected this ministry because they consider it “secular” since I’m not baptizing new Christians.  But I consider America’s lack of childcare to be a major social injustice, and I’m willing to lose my pension and benefits (and possibly my priesthood) in order to respond to this basic human need.<p>But I can’t do this alone:  ParentVillage is a local, online community, so it’s only effective if I create an “instant village” of at least 100 parents exchanging posts with each other.  So, can I recruit you as a recruiter, to forward the email below to all parents you know by Saturday at 5 pm?<p>It’s time to be outraged at the lack of support for parents seeking childcare.  If you will join me to make this email invitation go viral, we can create the village it takes to raise our children.  My “first draft” of a solution is not perfect.  But together, we can create a solution.  Please forward this email to every parent you know (for details see link below).
Thanks for caring,
David Code

First and formost being it&#x27;s a natural instinct to take in as much macro nutrients as possible, as densly as possible.  For most of the developed world, food isn&#x27;t really scarce.  That is where it starts.<p>Follow that by government subsidies that lean towards larger agribusiness which are ruled by companies that produce the most calorie dense foods at the cheapest prices.  No, you cannot feed the world without GMO corn, soy, rice etc.  Just the same, when you subsidize this it creates an artificial incentive to buy more of it.  Pre-packaged Hamburger Helper, candy bars (the likes of &quot;health&quot; bars, granola etc are candy here too) rule the roost even for those that do cook at home.<p>The third being marketing.  Americans are targeted by junk food ads far too much.  Everything from placement on store shelves to stores that operate on junk food (convenience stores with gas stations)... leading towards most of the U.S. necessitating cars to drive just about everywhere, which feeds laziness.<p>The fourth being laziness and atrophy...  By the time you get to an age where you start to care it may well be too late to make significant change.  I didn&#x27;t know a fraction of what I know about nutrition in my late teens and early 20&#x27;s... Now, I have a broken metabolism and simply reducing calories alone doesn&#x27;t work... it leads to a binge cycle.  I avoid carbs because of what it does to my blood sugar, but even then trying to keep calories in relative check, getting enough each day and not going over is far more difficult at 40, than it would have been when I was younger.  Compound this at a generational level, and it just feeds on itself.<p>I&#x27;m not making excuses here, it&#x27;s just not as cut and dry as &quot;you are fat, and you shouldn&#x27;t be&quot;.  Not to mention assumptions about health care... it&#x27;s cheaper on the community for you to be fat and die at 60, than to live until 80+.",1430507041

  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any specific set of technologies, which is a great
    opportunity to learn. In the past two years, I&#x27;ve worked with Python, iOS,
    Angular.js, CoffeeScript, QT, Node, Ruby, Rails, and more.

  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
    We pair when it makes sense.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design. For example. last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per
    week.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (www.grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have experience with a variety of technologies.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

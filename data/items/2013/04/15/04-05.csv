Only a large and powerful state can implement the required blocks to form monopolies.  Only a powerful state can entrench the class divide between the ruled and the rulers.<p>The solution, then, is to reduce the size of the state and allow for less central planning and involvement.<p>Further to this: the size of the state and those who run it seek to gain more power.  Power is delivered through votes.  Thus much that passes for political debate is not based on reason, but rather emotions and feelings - people finding and leveraging biases, beliefs and BS.   Virtually no modern policy making is done using reason and simple analysis - instead it is done by emotionally trying to sway the argument - the 'think of the children' model.<p>A triumph of reason over emotion and reduction in the size o f the state.

There's even a handy wrapper script included with OS X called opensnoop.<p>- Alternately, you can use the fs_usage command line tool to tap into the xnu kernel's trace mechanism. This shows all sorts of filesystem events, including what files are opened.<p>3) What libraries a binary is linked to<p>OS X binaries use the Mach-O format, not ELF like most other Unixes. So you have to use OS X's binary introspection tools to understand that format rather than the standard GNU binutils. What you're looking for here is otool, which lets you introspect Mach-O binaries. Specifically, ""otool -L /Applications/Mail.app/Mail"" for instance shows you which libraries Mail links to. Run this recursively to get the transitive closure of all dependencies a binary links against. Another way to do this is to run ""vmmap -v <pid>"" to show you the vm layout of a process, which includes the __TEXT/__DATA segments of all libraries the process links against.<p>And of course, gdb/lldb is included with the developer tools, you can just attach to whatever process you care about and set breakpoints, type ""info sharedlib"" to see what libraries are in the address space, etc. Also, for better or worse, Objective-C is an extremely dynamic language, so you can even do things like write a shared library with code you want to inject into a process (potentially monkey-patching existing methods using ObjC categories) and dlopen it from gdb to insert it into the target process's address space.",1366001127

Any hobby could be said to be a waste of your time or insignificant to your ""real"" life.<p>I also agree that while the news may be designed to make readers emotional and cause them to miss details or make cognitive errors, whether or not those negative effects happen depends on the reader.  I find reading the news to be an excellent exercise in figuring out which facts are really important in a story, especially when those facts are missing from whatever article you happen to be reading.  One of my favorite things to do after reading an obviously lacking article is to ask myself ""What fact or number could the author have presented to conclusively prove his point?"" And then try to find that fact or number.<p>As superficial as the news tends to be, it can still function as an entry point into a new subject.  A sufficiently bad article on a sufficiently interesting subject will prompt me to seek out some additional information on my own.  For example, silly rants about educational quality led me to read up on the ways that teacher performance is calculated.  Lackluster articles about the visual changes in Windows 8 made me seek out articles on theories of computer UI design.<p>Lastly, I will argue that some news consumption is in fact the imperative of good citizens in a democracy. Without some background on current events, a citizen can't make informed decisions in elections, or in their other civic activities.  While following every gaffe is obviously not necessary, a critical review of politician's claims requires that people understand what problems the politicians will be solving.",1366000679

It is the starting point and will continue to be because block-level storage is the major use-case. Block-level access accounts for basically all bulk storage in /dev. Extra performance and features (ioctl calls, or a management interface) are gravy, but without the block-level interface, it is not accessible to 99.9% of all software and will not serve for general storage, including pre-existing filesystems, from FAT12 to Btrfs. There are applications for which those are interfaces. There's no reason to make it difficult to apply those layers. Looking forward, if it can't store current and unforseen filesystems out of the box (the block interface), even if that means a 50% reduction in speed, it doesn't deserve the name ""mass storage."" Noone wants a key-value store even if it is 100% faster. They may be faster, but it doesn't look like storage. And there's no need for it to look different either, because people expect to be able to use it like a block device. Take WD Green drives with their larger allocation sizes. There happens to be an optimal cluster size, but the interface is still that of block IO. If flash works best for a certain allocation size or other tweaks, or even a specific high-level formatting, fine, but it's still going to need to provide the block IO interface as a starting point if it's going to be used as a drive.<p>It's nice to see at least one punitive downvote though.",1366000109

5549668,comment,5548730,5549553,3,0,zanny,,,"> Usually the government selling something off is not cited as an example of government intervention. Most lazzei-faire types believe that is exactly what government should do - sell off the property to put it in the hands of the free market.<p>When a government sells intangible information waveforms, I'd consider it intervention. Radio spectrum is not a finite resource. You <i>generate</i> radio waves with devices by producing electromagnetic radiation. The ""sale"" of spectrum implies that the government owns what is on the exact same scale as visible light, which is completely insane. But it is the world we live in.<p>> Most people in my state get their internet via cable wires laid in the past few decades.<p>I live on the East Coast, my experience is probably different. Do note that <i>cable</i> is much more modern than phone lines - what AT&T had laid a century ago, most cable is indeed decades old. My area was seeded with cable lines in the 60s, it was early at that too.<p>> Local governments are much closer to small market players than they are to the leviathan state. There are thousands of towns and cities, but usually only a couple cable companies in any area. The exclusivity contracts are usually given out of position of weak bargaining power.<p>I talk about this in another topic I made in this thread, and it mentions how economic systems larger than a political system can push around the politics to their own gains. The way cable companies extort local government is a prime example.<p>> And here is the problem that has nothing to do with government - broadband wired internet is a natural monopoly. There are extreme capital expenses and the company that builds the first network has a huge advantage, it is usually not profitable for a second business to enter the market.<p><i>Infrastructure</i> is a natural monopoly. There are dramatic diminishing returns on laying a second redundant set of the same thing than using one thing. I <i>personally</i> think fiber / cable / phone wire should be publicly owned and maintained, and ISPs provide gateways to the Internet via the routing servers and DNS caches to their clients, but you can contract with anyone to provide you the connection to the backbone.<p>Roads separate man from animal, in that man will slave to lay roads that benefit others, but not lose competitive reproductive advantages as a result. Any other animal that would forge their environment to the benefit of the many of their species would die off from having less energy to spend breeding. As a species, we have a unique ability to build foundations of road, power, and network that enable magnitudes of productivity gains for little cost - if we collectively agree to pay and support it. It isn't something I feel works well in a private competitive market, but I am pretty libertarian. So the solution to me is not to try to create artificial incentives to waste resources laying redundant cable, but that the cable should never be private in the first place. It is laid under public roads, run over private property, and should be a public good. It even <i>was</i>, for a brief time, until most local governments sold them to greedy business. I don't know how to solve the extortion problem, unless it is mandated at a higher level that the smaller governments can't sell off public infrastructure like that.<p>> Keep in mind that AT&T pretty much built its monopoly on its own. The government had the choice between breaking it up, and converting it to a regulated monopoly, and chose the latter. This may have been the wrong choice, but the country was probably better off for having at least some government intervention, and not allowing the monopoly to be completely unregulated and dedicated solely towards shareholder profits.<p>The early years of AT&T were a mix of government incentive and business practice. They spread so fast because everyone wanted phones, and they got subsidized to provide to <i>everyone</i>. It is another situation I think the correct solution would have been to go the way of roads (or maybe power lines) - public infrastructure supporting private, competitive end points. The phone lines should create a market for competition, as a foundational infrastructure an industry can be built on.",1365998891

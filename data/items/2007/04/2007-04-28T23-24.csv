I can't imagine getting a dell when, for approximately the same money, you can get a machine that can run OSX, windows, and ubuntu, with better display quality and support.

17785,comment,17669,17747,0,0,shiro,,,"From my experience of continuation-based web app, what you're dealing with is not a full continuation captured by call/cc, but rather a delimited (partial) continuation, which captures the continuation of your application logic but not the state of underlying protocols.  You can implement delimited continuations on top of call/cc, and I did based on Gasbichler&Sperber paper (ICFP02), but in most cases explicit CPS wrapped in some macros are just as well worked.

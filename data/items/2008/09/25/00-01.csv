A lot of hardcore hackers don't get this, but people don't like a lot of choices, and they especially like uniformity and consistency. I like that for my Ubuntu setup, all the apps have the same look and feel whether it be GTK or KDE, I keep them separate. I like that for Mac OS X they all have a common look and feel. I don't like that on Windows everything looks different.<p>So by bringing in all this extra crap, they loose that consistent look and feel, and that is basically what separates their platform to most people.

Y'know what their day job consists of?  Killing rats.  And checking rats to see if they're dead yet.  And feeding rats so they don't die quite yet.  And sitting around playing solitaire while they wait for rats to die.<p>There are people with Ph.D's seeking these jobs, and every time my friend interviews one, she thinks to herself, ""You want this job...why?""<p>Similarly, my sister is a petroleum geologist, and she needed a master's degree to get her job.  You know what she spends most of her time doing?  Coloring with crayons.  And looking at core sample muck.  And poring over maps.  And the odd PowerPoint presentation.<p>I think lots of people think of scientific jobs as being ones where you just sit around and think all day.  There is <i>one</i> job with that description: tenured professor.  And you need to be tenured, with a bunch of grad students to do the work.  Otherwise, your day job consists of dealing with whiny entitled students, lecturing, writing grant proposals, and building experiments in the machine shop.",1222304220

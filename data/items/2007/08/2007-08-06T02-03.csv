No one has a monopoly on music, because anyone can compose their own.  The same goes with software.  It's not artificial like restricting goods; it really is your hard work.<p>When I said ""Copying software is stealing"", I was incorrect.  What I meant to express was ""Copying software is wrong if you can afford to buy it"".  There's something morally wrong about taking someone's hard work against their wishes and giving it away for free.  I don't know what to call it, but don't you at least agree it <i>is</i> wrong?

The best way to do that is by example.  <p>We're hoping that 5 or 10 years from now, it will be a normal thing for the most ambitious hackers to start startups instead of going to work for big companies.  We think that will make hackerdom as a whole dramatically more productive.<p>If that comes to pass and we were among the leading agents of the change, it seems reasonable that we might make a lot of money from it.  But we don't have any idea how much.<p>In the short term we have to make at least enough to cover our expenses, because otherwise we'd run out of money and have to stop doing this.",1186366143

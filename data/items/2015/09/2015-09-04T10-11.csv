I have been in relationships with three or four men who had no idea I was interested in them initially; I was expecting them to make the first move, which they did after a long while. I hate to think of the number of potentially wonderful relationships I have missed out on because I never made the first move.<p>Seriously seriously seriously OP, you&#x27;ve got to try to make the first move.

I might work on a version without it, but I wanted to get this working as soon as possible and jQuery does help in code size reduction and ease of development.
Also this grid works without any javascript (pure css) so you only need javascript for drag&#x27;n&#x27;drop reordering",1441363969

The way to reach this MVP is not easy, but you must do it in order to keep focus and build the most important thing at the start.<p>As for libraries - You wish to avoid re-inventing the wheel (as it&#x27;s not moving you forward vis a vis your MVP). So invest time and research for SDKs/Libs that can boost your productivity.<p>Other good rules to follow:
1. Build a user testing focus group and see if your ideas got a true connection with reality. You will learn A LOT from this.
2. Plan for multiple releases - Don&#x27;t try to do too much for the first release. Iterate quickly and build your service/product in layers.
3. Measure and analyze your users&#x27; actions - It will give you a powerful tool to decide what to do and how to improve your releases.

Each directory entry was just a fixed-size 16 byte chunk; 2 bytes for the inode number and 14 for the filename.<p>Of course, this meant a limitation of 64K files per filesystem -- that was still OK for us (40MB would be a large disk) but was already would have caused problems for bigger servers.  It also was the cause of the &quot;classic&quot; UNIX 14-character filename limit.<p>By that time BSD4.2&#x27;s FFS filesystem had already removed both of these limits (which I assume is when opendir() and friends arrived)  According to wikipedia that made it to the AT&T world by SVR4 in the late 80s, which sounds correct.<p>As someone else mentioned some UNIXes may still let you open() a directory.

They are doing very <i>precise</i> calculations, but the result is still going to depend on the assumptions in the design (e.g. that you can infer anything about default risk from someone&#x27;s online &quot;friends&quot;), and the quality of the input data.<p>However, those technical concerns are not the main problem, which is <i>redlining</i>. Laws are slow in responding to changes, which allowed a lot of racists to maintain <i>de facto</i> segregation by simply claiming that someone &quot;didn&#x27;t qualify&quot; for some loan. This was easy, because the complex nature calculating someone&#x27;s default risk makes it easy to hide something that &quot;just happens&quot; to target a certain group of people. This becomes even easier (and provides more cover) when it starts to feedback on itself: (i.e. you&#x27;re a risk because you&#x27;re from $bad_area, but you have to live in $bad_area because we denied loans in the past). I highly recommend reading Ta-Nehisi Coates essay that explains this in far more detail[1].<p>Using a social-media &quot;friends list&quot; to judge loan risk is data with a very poor signal-to-noise ratio. That same &quot;friends list&quot; is also data that can be easily map to race or class, just like &quot;current address&quot; did for the lenders that redlined segregated areas to limit &quot;mud people&quot;[2] to subprime &quot;ghetto loans&quot;[2]. Which of these sounds like a more likely cause? Even if the developers at Facebook believe this is about &quot;more accurate loans&quot;, <i>someone</i> has other plans.<p>The complexity of modern technology has made it even easier to hide the real decision-making process, and machine learning techniques are the worst, where &quot;I&#x27;m not denying you a loan, the Magic Machine is! (even though I designed it and decided which data it gets to see)&quot;. These tools can certainly be useful, but it is incredibly important that you&#x27;re not just creating a proxy (both software and legal) that hides the underlying decision making process.<p>As you say, the government absolutely has a role here, but governments are slow to change.

I&#x27;ve gone past it.
If you wanna know how - keep reading:<p>1. If you&#x27;ve reached undesired places in your life - it for sure means
that you&#x27;ve followed the wrong roads. Gone the wrong path for you.
What you harvest now, is the plants you&#x27;ve been sowing all of your
life, until now. Keep sowing the same seeds, you&#x27;ll keep harvesting
the same results.
I would suggest you to doubt and question everything you thought and
believed about life, and recalculate route... ;-)<p>2. Here are the good news:
Have you asked yourself why do you post this question here in the web,
instead of jumping out of the window?..
What is that urge inside you that makes you wanna live?? Wanna be happy??
Block all your thoughts aside, just focus on that infinitely deep urge
of inside of you, that made you come here and ask for help.
This urge alone is the answer, the key for you to get out of the mud,
and live your life the way you want them to be.
You might, however, have to let go and give up things (you think) you
want - in order to break out of your own jail.
In other words - GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.
Don&#x27;t hold anything back. Drop all of your attachments. Be willing TO
SACRIFICE EVERYTHING, in order to attain that which is really
important to you.
Do you even know what it is?..
If not, finding it out will be a good start. ;-)<p>3. Get into a group of ppl like you. A group of searchers. Study
together, practice together, share your experience s and problems with
each other. That&#x27;s crucial for you and will help you way beyond you
can imagine. Just do it.
I&#x27;ve started by searching google with all questions I had about life,
girls, love. Don&#x27;t prejudge anything. Go with whatever speaks to your
heart.<p>If it feels good - you&#x27;re on the right way!!!<p>4. Lack of sex IS the reason for you unwillingness to live. Sex is
life force in our body. Once that vital enrgey is surpressed and block
inside of us, all of the universe becomes meaningless!!!
I want you to notice a very important point:
These two problems are circularly dependant!!! They CREATE EACH OTHER.
You are caught in a loop of no sex - no life desire - no sex - and so
on.
One sure way to break out of this miserable loop was given to you in
part 2 in my answer. :-)<p>I could write here a whole book for you, but I think you got enough. I will
finish with a quote of Tyler Durden (fight club, (RSD one is also
highly recommended)):
&quot;It&#x27;s only after you&#x27;ve lost everything, that you are free to do anything.&quot;<p>Have an awesome journey.",1441361202

We all look same on the inside. I am pretty sure your skeleton and the skeleton of Brad Pitt looks the same (Save for a difference in height). What you have on the outside, can be changed. Muscle can be built and fat can be lost. The only think that matters is, &quot;How bad you want it?&quot; (Also how many depressed body builders have you seen?)<p>So go on hit the gym (A good one with a good trainer, I guess you can easily afford that). Turn your desperation into muscle (But don&#x27;t overdo and don&#x27;t skip leg workouts).<p>And, this is very important, do not expect shit to change overnight. Actually don&#x27;t expect anything. Just hit the gym and work your ass out. Never stop and ask yourselves. &quot;What is the point anyway?&quot;. After an initial spurt of growth, your progress will probably hit a plateau. But just keep at it, even after you stop growing.<p>You can also join some dance classes, or martial arts classes. Force yourself to get out more often and meet more people.<p>And eventually you will start to see things differently. Good luck.",1441360878

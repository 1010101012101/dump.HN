They have to rely on specialists to do tech D&D and they rarely trust them completely. So they shy away from those deals, or they factor the risk into their valuations.<p>This behavior somewhat ironically can make these investments higher risk. There is a degree to which fund raising at a lower level makes a company a higher risk, because they have less money to work with and can&#x27;t afford to make mistakes.

In my opinion you have to distinguish between web apps and content pages.<p>In the first, client side templating is just fine and the right way. Everything changes and the users are making a great deal of changing the output. A round-trip here is destroying the feeling of an app.<p>In the second, client side templating is just unnecessary. But so is server side templating, in many cases. Taken that the pages to display are rarely changed it would be even better to have simple static html, pre compiled.<p>The hard task comes when we have some mixed scenarios. A CMS for example. In my opinion the content creation process is a very valid use case for client-side-rendering - an app for creating html output, if you will. But when it comes to display that content it should reside precompiled (no server side rendering) on the server. So that just plain html pages have to be delivered to the actual users.",1421739998

A lot of the other uses are similarly for other FFI tasks, interfacing with libraries like FreeType, HarfBuzz and Spidermonkey. Obviously it would be nice for those libraries to be in Rust and thus avoid the FFI-is-always-unsafe , but the ecosystem is still young and those libraries are seriously non-trivial, Mozilla and the Servo team presumably want to be able to do the interesting parts of their experimentation rather than spending years porting all the low-level libs to Rust first.<p>For some &quot;success stories&quot;, Servo&#x27;s CSS parser was now pure Rust, and has a single `unsafe` block: <a href=""https://github.com/servo/rust-cssparser/blob/38877bc0a50a64a545a62eeff46cfb3f285d616b/src/tokenizer.rs#L59"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/servo/rust-cssparser/blob/38877bc0a50a64a...</a> .

Being informed that your opinions on a specific topic - of which you are acutely aware are being immediately recorded - will definitely be reported to the police, is not the same as the more vague notion of some unknown entity recording and possibly analysing your everyday words. There may be a perceptual difference between personal surveillance and mass surveillance, which is not addressed in that study. As an analogy, consider the ubiquitous, largely unnoticed CCTV coverage in urban areas, versus the acutely uncomfortable feeling of being followed down the street - the two perceptions are quite different.<p>That survey of writers linked by Schneier [2] describes its limitations - namely, that it is not really representative of all writers, only those that self-selected (from an email sent to them on the topic of government surveillance) to answer the survey, and that the sample sizes are relatively small. Also, the writers surveyed are all affiliated with the organisation conducting the survey, an advocacy group for freedom of expression. This may well bias the results towards that group rather than writers in general. Indeed, the report authors explicitly state: &quot;the findings cannot be generalized to represent all writers in any given region or level of freedom.&quot;<p>Another point specific to students is that, if they choose to pursue an academic career, it necessitates publishing research to a wide audience (wider than their professional colleagues, at least). Surveillance involves the intrusion of privacy, but publication is essentially the opposite of privacy, so how can it be negatively affected by surveillance, and mass surveillance in particular?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA013230"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Chilling_01-05-15_FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Chilling_01-...</a>",1421739473

As long as people/consumer keeps pumping in money & time to it, its value will stay or rise from its current value. Once that stops and people/consumer stop using it, its value will eventually fall.<p>SpaceX on the other hand is not a consumer product yet, but is aiming to become one. Consider it just like Boeing or AirBus, nobody would have valued them as a multi-billionaire company ( back in 1900s when they were founded). Their technological advancements and the development phase would have been same as SpaceX right now.<p>But eventually it became a very integral part of human life. They have become a consumer product, their value is now because of people using it daily. And unlike WhatsApp people won&#x27;t stop using air-travel.<p>Everyday people do not invest directly into it like they do(?) for WhatsApp, but indirectly by using airline services they are paying for it.

I absolutely agree that the number of people using Machine Learning within the atomistic simulation community is skyrocketing. But everyone is just exploring the range of possibilities and trying to see what the essential elements are for it to be successful. I think having more people working on it is a great thing!<p>Regarding LAMMPS, actually the GAP code is now also easily usable there with this plugin : <a href=""https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIPforLAMMPS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIPforLAMMPS</a><p>The bispectrum is indeed a very powerful tool, but is not the ideal feature vector for representing the atomic environment. You should have a read of Bartok&#x27;s more recent paper on this: <a href=""http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.184115"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.87.184...</a> . One of the issues is that the bispectrum starts with an approximation of the neighbourhood atomic density as a sum of delta functions. Trying to represent such sharp features in a basis set expansion is actually very slowly converging. So the idea behind SOAP is to build a covariance kernel by directly comparing a smooth measure of the similarity of environments, which is also invariant to all physically relevant symmetry operations.<p>I would also like to add that in addition to GAP and SNAP, there are people like Jörg Behler doing this with Neural Networks and Francesco Paesani/Greg Medders with a different regression schemes. But in addition to making potential energy surfaces there are people like Paul Popelier `learning&#x27; atomic charges for building force fields and people in Vijay Pande&#x27;s group doing machine learning on MD trajectories, which is something that excites me a great deal and I would love to understand in more detail.<p>It&#x27;s a very exciting time to be in this field!",1421738095

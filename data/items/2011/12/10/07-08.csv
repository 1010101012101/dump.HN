I'm not sure what you mean by the casing being ""extraneous"" either.  It seems to be quite plain, actually, at least on the one.  That red one, though, is pretty ugly.  Frankly, the stylus is the most obvious difference.<p>I guess, ultimately, I don't know what to say about all of this.  Minimalism has been a trend for quite a while now, given how many products (including many of Apple's) that display it.  Is Apple one of the trendsetters?  Do they make beautiful products?  Absolutely.<p>But all this patent silliness about getting each others' products banned has just got to stop.  Every penny spent on it keeps them from hiring engineers to make something even better than what we have now.  I don't like seeing Apple's products banned for using a Motorola standard any more than I like seeing the Galaxy Tab banned for being too minimalist.  If they had any sense, they'd call off the lawyers and settle with each other before they waste any more money.",1323503273

3337202,comment,3335603,3336382,3,0,rayiner,,,"Regulation is one solution to market failures. It's not the only solution, but in many cases it works well. The Clean Air Act, for example, has been extremely successful at addressing the negative externalities created by air pollution.<p>Beyond that--the lesson that we're learning from modern economics research is that there are no touchstones. Humans aren't rational actors, the efficient allocation theories are predicated on unrealistic assumptions about the behavior of economic actors and the lack of transaction costs, etc. ""Laissez faire"" isn't any more of a guiding principle than ""big brother knows best."" The <i>only</i> way to proceed is empirically--use measurements to determine when government solutions are needed and when market solutions suffice.<p>It's a fairly uncontroversial claim that the market naturally under invents in R&D. It's something you'll see in any basic economics 101 textbook. So why shout ""laissez faire"" to a government initiative addressing such a market failure?",1323503071

3337198,comment,3335603,3336775,2,0,rayiner,,,"> The best way to allocate resources is to have knowledgeable parties commence in free exchange. The role of government is to ensure that force and fraud are absent from the marketplace. If there is any further goal of the government it could possibly be encouraging the spread of information, although that is rife with conflicts of interest.<p>We have about 50 years of research showing that there are way more barriers to efficient allocations via the market than just information asymmetries.

So many possibilities...but I'm slowly learning to overcome this.

Unadulterated self deception!<p>So where to look for great ideas? Here might be one candidate - places where people have been collecting and digesting data about a problem area for a period of time, find themselves stuck with a problem, toss and turn it around for a while and find an unprecedented way to think about it. In other words, ask ""what process of engagement with the domain have you gone through that led to that idea?"".

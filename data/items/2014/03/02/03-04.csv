Typically yes, and that is exactly why the compiler can remove the check after it, it&#x27;s already undefined behavior so it can assume the optimistic case (and remove the check).<p>2. But it is not always true that it would crash. p->some_field might happen to be in a valid memory location to be accessed. This doesn&#x27;t happen normally because low memory addresses (0-1024, say) tend to not be accessible by userspace programs. But I am not aware of a spec ensuring that.

Just tell women to stop feeling marginalized?<p>There are countless subtle ways a all-male (or all-female or all-Christian or all-straight or all-gay or all-white or all-black or all-[insert demographic here) subculture will do things unwittingly that make people not in that demographic uncomfortable. As a member of the majority in almost every respect, I&#x27;ve rarely experienced that, but I&#x27;m not so self-absorbed to insist it&#x27;s not a real, legitimate thing that happens. Identifying each and every one of these things is nigh impossible. Convincing everyone to STOP doing these things IS impossible. So what do we do? We attack it the only way we can: identify and point out what issues we can (the happy majority will inform us that they&#x27;re silly, over-sensitive complaints) and do everything we can to bring in people who can change that culture simply by being there, being someone who is NOT part of the problem culture.<p>But we&#x27;re too damn busy being offended by this conference and threatened by the idea that there&#x27;s subtle sexism in the tech industry (or the world) to even try listening to any sort of feminist theories about privilege and power and marginalization.<p>I know, modern feminist theories about oppressive patriarchal culture sound really, really outlandish at first, and my first instinct was to reject them and just say &quot;everyone&#x27;s equal; let&#x27;s treat them equally&quot;. Many are stated really inflammatory and surely some are way off-base.<p>But shit. The world&#x27;s a fucked up place. And if you start looking at what earns people respect and power and what invites derision, you begin to recognize that maybe this overly-sensitive complaint about subtle sexism, and that gripe about feeling uncomfortable as a minority in a group, and it all starts to reveal itself as, well, reality. It&#x27;s hurting us as a group, and it&#x27;s oppressive each one of us as individuals. (Unless you&#x27;re a handsome, masculine, white, Protestant, alpha male, football-playing frat bro, in which case maybe you&#x27;re 100% on the privileged side--congratulations!)<p>(Sorry, this rambling rant isn&#x27;t really directed at you.

(This was already our priority before yesterday, I promise)<p>We like working on npm because JavaScript is fun, and solving problems that lots of people have -- about how to share code, deploy it, and scale it -- are really rewarding. We are not interested in working long, life-destroying hours. We are interested in working with people who are sane, fun, and friendly.

This severely messed up the design of inner classes and then generics in Java -- and then Sun broke bytecode compat anyway!&quot; [Source](<a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebPart2MadnessOrJustInsanity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageFo...</a>)<p>We are at a point where JS is following the same path. Ideas like ECMAScript 4 were rejected because they would break compatibility and we are still working around the problems of JS. We need that clean break now rather than later. Such a clean break would be at it&#x27;s best now rather than later. We could simply continue supporting the current JS compilers &#x27;as is&#x27; for old code (or provide a JS to new language compiler) and replace the language with another which is designed correctly (we could perhaps break the DOM too).<p>While I would like to see a scheme r7rs used (except with support for OOP, built-in actors, and static typing), I suspect that M-expressions (more like dylan) would be necessary (though for the record, I&#x27;ve seen more nested parenthesis/braces in JS code than I&#x27;ve seen in a lot lisp code). Such a language could also be interpreted via JS (or compiled to JS) for old browsers (though I suspect telling people to upgrade or go without would promote suitable updating more akin to telling everyone to change to digital TV or go without).<p>We need a clean break and lisp is worthy of consideration rather than being cast to the side like last time.",1393729654

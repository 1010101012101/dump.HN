3091685,comment,3090868,3091653,6,0,jerf,,,"If you're serious about this moving forward, I very strongly suggest renaming it. PHP.reboot is a very hostile, aggressive name that is clearly trying to steal thunder. Call it a reboot of PHP informally, playfully base the name off of PHP somehow, but don't outright call your language ""PHP.something that Google won't correctly parse as part of the same word so the search will still pull up nothing but PHP results"". In addition to the hostile nature of the name, being effectively Google-blacklisted isn't a great way to start.<p>Also, admittedly off of just a glance, beware the specialized syntax sinkhole. Can I easily take two XML snippets and compose them together somehow? Can I easily take two SQL snippets and compose them together? A lot of times these specialized syntaxes make for cute-looking demos but in practice work out worse than just using language constructs because they are <i>so</i> highly specialized you can't do anything with them but exactly the one use case the author had in mind. I'd submit there's a reason that basically no large-scale successful language has this sort of specialized syntax built into it, and you may want to ponder on those reasons until you understand them. It isn't because it's hard to write the grammar or anything implementation-related like that. (And I'm not saying don't do it. Personally, I think it's a solvable problem. Look to LINQ for what is probably the closest to date. I'm suggesting you try to spend some time understanding why the obvious solutions haven't worked before you go too far down what can be a language-killing rathole.)",1318204356

Of course this doesn't mean PHP needs integrated queries or anything, but it is a very nice feature to have if done right.  XML/json literals, on the other hand, do feel kind of wrong to me though (although I bet they are handy still, as many vb.net devs will probably attest to).<p>[Edited for spelling - damn ipad keyboard!]",1318204351

It was also used to debug the hotspot implementation of JSR 292.<p>The language is tailored unlike any dynamic languages. Instead of adding features and wondering how to optimize them after, I have worked backward and carefully pick/design features only if I was able to optimize it to be at least as fast as Java.<p>The hidden jewel of PHP.reboot is its runtime which first interpret the script and then use a type inference/type checker algorithm to try to emit exactly the same bytecode as javac.\nSo some parts of the language are quite fast, but not the whole language because some parts still run in interpreted mode only.<p>As a demo, I've taken the mandelbrot benchmark from the Computer Language benchmark[1] and write it in PHP.reboot\n(I hope with no mistake).

3091650,comment,3090457,3091472,3,0,jrockway,,,"Thanks!<p>It's also worth pointing out that Emacs and Emacs Lisp need not be multithreaded in order to implement specific asynchronous operations.  If aio did not exist, there's nothing stopping you from creating a thread (from C), doing your blocking save there (and nothing else), and sending a note back to the lisp side when it's done.  It's generic threading that adds complexity, because that would require all state-changing operations to be threadsafe, which can be very difficult to ""bolt on"" to a complex system like Emacs.  (Not to mention locking overhead; see Python's GIL debate.)<p>A good example of this approach is the 0MQ messaging library.  While it is internally threaded, it does not care what the application does about thread safety; there is no way that you can ever ""see"" its threads.  It simply requires that you pass ownership of blocks of memory to the library, thus avoiding locking and issues of thread safety while still using threads.",1318203775

Steve was very much the later.<p>I started working for Apple at the Apple store. I later moved to Server Engineering. When I first arrived in Cupertino, the one thing that struck me was that the engineers at Apple were leveling harsher criticism at OS X and the rest of Apple's software than I had ever heard before. Even the most ardent Windows or Linux fanboys couldn't hit as hard as these engineers.<p>So many people seem to talk about ""Steve the task-master"". In reality, his true talent was picking people that would be as obsessed with perfection as he was. I suspect that the random report you hear from a ""former Apple employee"" complaining about Steve as some sort of tyrant were the result of the handful of times that the hiring process didn't go according to plan (it happens). My experience was largely that, as you went up the chain of command at Apple, managers weren't demanding more work from their underlings, but less.

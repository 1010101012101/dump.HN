1007833,comment,1007659,1007777,0,0,jesnell,,,"SBCL's low level code generation is total crap, the smart bits are in the high level optimizations. (And to be honest, even those smart bits are fundamentally 80s technology, it's just that most dynamic language implementations never got even that far up the technology ladder). What James is doing is hooking LLVM in after most of those high level optimizations have been done, but letting LLVM worry about instruction selection, instruction reordering, register allocation, etc.<p>(Edit: Oh, but the place where it's hooked into also is bypassing some compiler passes that might turn out to be too fundamental, like representation selection which decides whether values should be stored tagged or as raw machine values. One theory is that some of LLVM's more advanced or future optimizations will obviate the need for that pass. The other is that really LLVM should work at the same level as other SBCL backends, after all the generic low level decisions have been made. This work is still at such an early stage that we haven't even figured out which of the two theories is true.)",1261407232

I agree that other countries have a more rational system based on national self-interest - take fewer immigrants, make sure they're the most productive ones, profit.  Hey, if I were New Zealand, I'd be selective too.  Their country is essentially a beautiful national park.  A few top scientists isn't going to hurt anything, and it'll help.  But opening the floodgates would be a terrible idea.<p>That said, I absolutely disagree that this makes the US ""anti-immigrant.""  In some ways, it makes the US more <i>pro</i> immigrant - we're more likely to give people a chance to prosper who wouldn't otherwise have had it.  Sure, we'd benefit more by only allowing in top engineers, physicians, lawyers, and bankers, would would that really make us pro-immigrant?",1261407216

1007818,comment,1006310,1006310,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The garage door opener in question is <i>weak</i>.  It has rolling codes to deter replay attack, but its behavior in ""resynch"" mode is a classic example of security by obscurity: ""Send two incorrect codes, then another off by three.""<p>If you're going to have a protection against replay attacks, why are you going to have a resynch scheme so vulnerable?  This may or may not not be vulnerable to replay attacks, but it sounds like something kids would use to authenticate entry to a treehouse!<p>This is especially sad, since freely available block ciphers could do a fine job with a challenge-response protocol, and wouldn't require a resynch function.  One could assume that both the opener and the remote are securely in the hands of the owner, so both could be programmed with the same secret key.<p>Even without challenge-response, a more robust protocol should be possible with a little memory and a time stamp.  Just keep a list of last few day's successful attempts, and don't accept any already sent.  The encrypted hourly time stamp would be incorporated into the encoded passphrase, and a passphrase from the hour before or hour after would be accepted.  A passphrase might consist of a number appended to it's inverse, appended to the timestamp.<p>The attacker cannot overrun the successful attempt record, because she cannot produce a new successful attempt without the symmetric key, and replaying the old one doesn't do anything.<p>To make this proof against losing the time synch, just do two things: 1) have the opener adopt the timestamp of the last successful attempt and 2) provide a time-resynch passphrase, which is activated by a different button, and which also results in a ""already used"" record in the case of a successful attempt.<p>EDIT: It's gotten to the point that I can imagine the lack of an idiotic law like the DMCA could be a <i>strategic advantage</i> for some other country, which will result in far greater technical innovation.

1007780,comment,1006589,1006994,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"The first year or two on HN, when the community was smaller and tighter knit, I found that when I recognized other usernames, I tended to feel an emotional attachment to them.  The userbase was smaller, and thus, easier to say, ""Oh, it's nostrademons.  I like him.  I'll reply to his comment"".  I felt that familiarity facilitated a sense or cordiality and camaraderie in our discussions.  I think that was largely a function of group size.<p>I've lost that sense of camaraderie here in the past year.  I find myself contributing less to the discussions, and I certainly don't submit near as much as I used to.  I still lurk a lot, but I don't recognize a lot of the current users and I have no sense of personal attachement to most people here aside from the friends I've made over the last couple of years here.  I imagine it's the same with a lot of other users.<p>If users could somehow be herded or segmented into smaller groups, that the sense of familiarity, community, and camaraderie might be able to continue in the discussions while a site scales.  I don't know if it's necessarily a function of what limits, permissions or abilities that would be placed on individuals within the smaller groups, however.  In meat space, an individual's actions and interactions change dramatically depending on group size.  I suspect that similar forces work online, too.<p>The question is, how do you segment the community into smaller groups or swarms?  I actually think that this can be acheived using recommendations.  I have a hypothesis that I want to test.  My hypothesis is that if reddit had succeeded in their recommendation engine, there would not have been a need for Hacker News.  Why?  Because those of us early reddit readers who were interested in hacking and founding would have remained somewhat clustered together automatically via article recommendations.  We wouldn't have gotten irritated at the trolls and left.  We would still be reading and commenting together on similar articles.  All the while, the site could grow, and the users that were heavily intersted in politics, religion/atheism, zombies, etc... would have been ushered together via common recommendations as well.

There is nothing out there, no places to go, no economical resources to claim.  The analogy to seafaring implicit in the term spacefaring is an emotional appeal to adventure and discovery. But going to the moon is not comparable to the discovery and colonization of America. I am happy we went to the moon, it is a great achievement but nobody can live there or on Mars. Though I oppose govt stimulus spending, if we must spend a fortune on an ""adventure"" program let's colonize the oceans or learn to sea-farm or drill to the center of the Earth or build giant pyramids in the Nevada desert. Such projects would at least have the virtue of being honest goals.",1261405201

I’m from California and go to school in Boston, and I don’t know anyone who uses “pedanticism.”<p>Anyway, I concede that literally is often used as an intensifier, even non-ironically. I like the end of that Slate article:<p>> <i>The one sensible criticism that can be made about the intensive use of literally is that it can often lead to confusing or silly-sounding results. In this case, the answer is simple: Don't write silly-soundingly. Some usage books even bother to make this point about literally. Then again, most usage advice could be reduced to one simple instruction: ""Be clear."" But that would be the end of a publishing category.</i>",1261404858

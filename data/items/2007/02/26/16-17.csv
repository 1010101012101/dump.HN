I&#39;m sure there are plenty of successful companies piloted by only one founder or more than 2 founders.  The sample isn&#39;t statistically kosher if you will.  Success doesn&#39;t depend on the number of people founding the company.  It depends more on the idea, the talent, the will and the execution of the idea.",1172508901

1222,comment,1202,1202,0,0,amichail,,,"You can also use it to do code search by automatically tracking which commit comments correspond to which lines of code. That way, you can search for drag and drop say and get back code that has been part of commits where the commit comment included the words drag and drop. You can also try doing code search without commit comments at all by giving each line of code a profile that includes words found in committed code where that line was involved. For example, the line may have been included in several commits where other lines included the words drag and drop, and so you might infer that this line probably has something to do with drag and drop as well.",1172506531
1221,comment,1191,1191,0,0,drop19,,,"This article gave me a lot of encouragement and heart, because they are based in New York and because they are out-hacking large, established players.  <p>I agree with what Paul et al have written about the importance of being in a startup hub, but this article makes me think that if you are targeting a particular industry (like advertising), you might be able to find success by locating yourself wherever those industries are concentrated.  Not as good as being in a hub, but an option for people who find themselves elsewhere.<p>It&#39;s also a perfect example of a small (comparatively tiny Quigo) company flying under large behemoths (Google and Yahoo) by being open, agile, and transparent.",1172506363

My site, http://www.klipboardz.com, tries to solve this problem by using some of the same suggestions that you listed. We have a recommended area that lists stories based on what sites you visit and your up and down votes. We also promote users to create groups and add friends so that they can have as many focused groups as they want to share certain stories. I&#39;ve found the best way to sort through all the info is to use the group view, which lists the top stories in each of your groups on one page. That view almost always allows me to find interesting content.",1172505987

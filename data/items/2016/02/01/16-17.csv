In the USA, deliberately using counterfeit trademarks is a crime, not just a tort (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_Counterfeiting_Act_of_1984"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_Counterfeiting_Act_o...</a> ). The standard for being found guilty of a crime is &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;, not just &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; as it would be for a tort. There is no way to electronically establish counterfeiting has occurred beyond reasonable doubt, because the completely legal scenario I described is electronically indistinguishable. It&#x27;s not acceptable to go accusing people of crimes when you know you can&#x27;t meet that standard of proof.<p>EDIT: As a practical example, consider the case of I2C. This is a proprietary NXP protocol, and you have to pay to get slave addresses. So instead people use &quot;Two Wire Interface&quot;, which is not I2C but is electronically indistinguishable. The only way to detect counterfeit use of I2C is looking at the packaging/documentation.",1454345963

Get user input, read a file, do this do that with it.<p>Why? the C standard library is full of gotchas and tricks and goofy shit that makes it unsuitable for new programmers. The comp.lang.c FAQ should be standard reading material for anyone taking a C class. Look at all the posts on StackOverflow about the stdio functions &#x27;not working right&#x27; and asking how to do menial things like collect keypresses.<p>C works well as a first language if you teach it like assembly (use of which as a teaching language is another debate): flip some bits and do some loops. But not for collecting user input/output. Half of your students are going to get stuck trying to collect a list of names from the user, before they even get a chance to get stuck trying to sort the list.",1454345924

In software terms that means higher level languages with sophisticated libraries, and languages like C are relegated to more of an infrastructure role.<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily bad.  If the technology is more capable then everybody wins at the end of the day.

There is no concept of update during a server side page rendering, which is quite similar to how the mental model for libraries like react work.<p>There&#x27;s no concept of update in Mustache either, but on the client updates do happen, and virtual DOMs present one strategy for that while preserving the mental model.<p>> Technically, we can find many differences but in terms of thinking about actual applications, they are a very similar mental burden and that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s been so popular. I always laugh when I see people talk about DOM diffing as motivation for react. Really, that&#x27;s the implementation detail. The real motivation is the vastly simplified mental model of how the whole DOM is managed.<p>Why do you think that? A virtual DOM is not necessary for this  mental model, Glimmer and other non-vdom libraries allow this as well. The advantage to the vdom approach is that it truly abstracts away UI rendering so that it&#x27;s not tied to a DOM and therefore is more easily portable to Node, and various native environments.",1454345724

For the most part, the scrutiny of government auditors ensure that you actually can&#x27;t work more than 40 hours in a single week.  Sometimes the contract also ensures that the work cannot be done outside of a government-controlled facility.<p>So if you&#x27;re the actual do-the-work peon instead of someone in any of the several tiers of useless middlemen, you work regular 8 hour days, get 10 or 11 paid holidays, and when you get home you are simply <i>done</i> with work until the morning of the next workday.  It does not matter much if you do your job well or do it poorly, because there are so many other people working on it that you will never get recognition for a job done well, nor will you get any blame for doing it poorly, so long as it does what it says on the box.<p>The deadlines also vary by contract, but as every layer of middlemen adds its own padding, it wouldn&#x27;t be remarkable to have two years to develop yet-another-CRUD-app with zero scalability, compatibility, or interoperability requirements.<p>No one doing the actual work is a direct government employee, because the uniform pay schedules are completely incompatible with industry norms.  The government employees are simply there to make sure the contractors do what is required.<p>The net result is that you can get all your work done in just 2 hours and look busy for 6, or amble through it at a sloth&#x27;s pace, gold-plating everything, achieving 100% test coverage, using ordinary software as a teaching lab for industry best practices, and such.<p>There are plenty of downsides, of course.

Or did you have something else in mind?<p>They&#x27;re not novel concepts, but they&#x27;re hard to pull off at scale. There&#x27;s no technological &quot;magic pill&quot; here - it&#x27;s just a lot of continuous improvement on infrastructure. Oversubscription makes it possible to have a 150 mbps connection for under $300/mo. Oversubscription also makes some assumptions in order to make the statistical multiplexing work, and one of those assumptions is a certain level of concurrency and bandwidth usage.<p>Also, keep in mind that one of the ISPs most effective bandwidth management tricks is psychological: if they make you think that data is a limited resource, people will treat it like one and use less of it. Even if they don&#x27;t end up charging you, the mere rumor that your ISP might charge you more if you go over is enough to get people to at least consider the amount of data they use.<p>> If T-Mobile can deliver unlimited data for video streaming then they can deliver unlimited data for all content types.<p>Because other content types aren&#x27;t the problem: video is. Video is 70-80% of consumer Internet traffic (sorry, no source that I can share). T-Mobile can only offer unlimited video because they are taking something that accounts for 3/4 of their last-mile traffic and slashing the bitrate by 50%. They&#x27;re not saying what video you can or can&#x27;t watch, nor are they changing the content of the videos.<p>And video is only problematic because it needs to sit in multiple &quot;buckets&quot; at once.

The difference un scale between traveling to the moon and travelling to a nearby star is about the same difference in scale between throwing a rock down a typical garden and launching astronauts to the moon.

They are all great folks, but with Samsung driving the train, I think this is no longer exclusively a volunteer project or necessarily strictly a labor of love for everyone anymore.<p>That being said, it should work.  I&#x27;ve successfully installed the dev kit from ARM-MALI support which provides Ubuntu + Mali T604 drivers on an SD card or USB (this was a herculean effort, despite the instructions in question being made specifically for the specific device I have).<p>I haven&#x27;t repeated this experiment, but I&#x27;d like to try again.  I&#x27;d feel the chances it would work would be higher on Arch, where software is kept more up-to-date than on the ancient kernel and OS that ARM documentation suggested (it&#x27;s Ubuntu, but not the current release, or even the current LTS release.)<p>You probably already found this page[1] -- r6p0 seems to be newer than when I tried last, maybe you also saw this one[2] -- the best &quot;from-scratch&quot; resource I&#x27;ve found that results in a working graphics driver, but good luck getting a modern release of E20 to compile on that... perhaps it could be upgraded without breaking everything.<p>This thread[3] I haven&#x27;t visited for a while, but that chronicles my journey pretty well, at least prior to the point where I was trying ALARM or Arch Linux for ARM.<p>The arch install guide[4] is probably your best bet for what you wanted.  I was able to get framebuffer driver installed and hosting the fastest yet (non-accelerated) enlightenment version 20 without compiling anything, and without any really complicated setup steps.  I haven&#x27;t found anyone who is using the accelerated drivers on Arch, the reason might be that they are closed-source and compiled for a specific (obsolete) kernel version.<p>There are scripts for compiling enlightenment, if you were going to set out to compile it from git head for yourself, by the way[5].  Don&#x27;t worry they&#x27;re called &quot;e-nineteen&quot; -- the latest git head is in fact e-twenty.  They should work on any recent Ubuntu or Debian release, don&#x27;t know about Arch, but you will at least need to take out the line that checks for a specific Ubuntu release to get that to work.  May need some specific compile-time flags for efl or enlightenment also.  I read something about sun-xi the Open-Source GLES driver for Mali, but it seems to be intended for other chipsets than the T604.<p>I would thereby hazard a guess that you&#x27;re right, and in fact nobody has figured this out yet.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/arm-mali-midgard-gpu-user-space-drivers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/drivers/arm-mali-midg...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://malideveloper.arm.com/documentation/developer-guides/graphics-and-compute-development-on-samsung-chromebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://malideveloper.arm.com/documentation/developer-guides/...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://community.arm.com/thread/6477"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.arm.com/thread/6477</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/samsung/samsung-chromebook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/samsung/samsung-chro...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://gitlab.metrixmatrix.com/kingdonb/e-nineteen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gitlab.metrixmatrix.com/kingdonb/e-nineteen</a>",1454345285

Just like immutability offered an easy way to avoid costly virtual DOM regeneration when the view gets rather large (in terms of instantiated component count).

Well a number of reasons but the two main ones are 1) it teaches you about what is happening at a lower level so you have some idea about what is happening behind the scenes of that Java code you wrote or whatever and 2) it makes you appreciate just how lucky you have it in higher level languages.<p>However I don&#x27;t think you should start writing all your programs in C! Use the right tool for the job.

Within engineering we are a passionate group of people who are extremely interested in building the software that helps our customers around the country thrive in their local communities. We’re a pretty small team (currently ~24 people) so you’ll have plenty of say around how we develop software going forward. We are currently in the process of modernizing our software platform to be more modular and truly data driven. Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. We’re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that we’re using: Dropwizard, Flyway, React, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to choose their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We’re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let&#x27;s save each other&#x27;s time). In addition we’re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.<p>---<p>Founded in 2010, Main Street Hub is the CRM for Local.

Career switching from the military to development has been interesting in this regards.  The military uses chat, but only when needed—realtime communication is critical and people are distributed geographically.  On duty on the carrier keeping track of planes and other issues happening “in country”, chat is great.  On the ground in Iraq scheduling airborne assets and keeping track of SF missions, chat is great.  But for most things, chat is more of a distraction and slows down the real work.<p>I understand chat if you are working in operations, but for pure development, it feels like a college dorm, more about the community and less about the work, where people still confuse time at the office with getting your work done.  After a decade of 70+ hour work weeks, you really appreciate what is work and what isn’t.  Building camaraderie is important, but chat probably isn’t the best way.  And putting everyones communications in a single channel isn’t helping communication, it’s increasing distraction.<p>In my ideal dev team, you have chat, use it for one-on-one communication, and for anything that is time sensitive which goes into group channels.  Anything that not everyone needs to know or isn’t time sensitive should go in an email or a message or a shoulder tap.  Cluttering a few group channels with a ton of individual conversations, meaningless alerts, and random banter is downright juvenile and a detriment to productivity.

11012799,comment,11012223,11012559,0,0,floppydisk,,,"1) Phrase it as a help-me-help-you arrangement. You&#x27;re getting gauged on how much stuff your team is getting done. Let me help you improve your performance metrics by reducing my meeting load and letting me focus more on coding. Our output metrics will look a lot better and you&#x27;ll come out smelling like a rose. Sr. Management will love you and your results. Sell them on what gets them ahead (and it&#x27;s also in your interest).<p>2) I liken a good manager to an old school point guard in basketball or a good coach. Your job isn&#x27;t to score but to setup your teammates for success and create a culture of excellence they can thrive in on your team.<p>Be ruthless about your meeting schedule and filtering input that actually needs to make it to your team. You should be the first POC for anyone needing your team or people on your team to do things to filter it for appropriateness rather than letting your engineers handle things. I&#x27;m not talking about their buddy in IT asking them a question, but people like Joe in Accounting who thinks it&#x27;d be slick if they could add FeatureX to the software because their boss thinks it&#x27;s cool and it&#x27;d be sweet if it could be in this release. &quot;Ya Know ;)&quot;. As a manager your first job is to firewall your people and help handle task requests, analyze them, and prioritize them.<p>Also as a manager you help handle tasking and assignments. While you&#x27;re building out your current sprint--and you&#x27;re keeping up with what&#x27;s happening so you can keep bosses apprised and off your team&#x27;s back--you&#x27;re also preparing for the next one, organizing requirements, incorporating feedback, etc. so when the team is ready for the next batch of tasking, it&#x27;s already there and ready for them to process.<p>WRT meetings, make your meetings targeted, on point, and ruthless enforce them. You&#x27;re the boss. If someone&#x27;s running their mouth without reason and taking up time, politely cut them off and get back on track. Have a clear objective for the meeting and stick with it. Once you&#x27;ve hit it, you&#x27;re done. End the meeting everyone get back t work. Schedule your meetings for either mornings or late afternoons (preferably mornings) to give people plenty of time to get &quot;deep work&quot; done without having to worry about only having an hour to code before a meeting. If other people are trying to draw your team into meetings, figure out whether it&#x27;s something you can handle and if so, you go. Let your team do their job. Again, you&#x27;re the firewall.<p>This also means getting to know your team personally and being able to read how they&#x27;re doing. Does someone look really run down and out of it after a long week? Send them home early. Someone having a hard time getting things done on time? Sit down and talk with them, not adversarially, ask them what&#x27;s going on, and what you can do to help. Politely point out what you&#x27;ve noticed and why it concerns you. Maybe their estimating wrong or their skill level isn&#x27;t up to the work. You can help fix that. You&#x27;re their coach. Know your team and help them succeed.",1454344536

More delegation and indirection?<p>Totally with you here. I also make it mandatory that everyone coming to a meeting read the offline discussion before hand.

I&#x27;ve worked as a civil servant, at two startups, a large corporation, and for a three letter government agency.  I made a decision early in my career not to move into management, but to advance to the &quot;team lead&quot; position at most.<p>I love and hate my job every day.  I have no better time than when I am coding, but I hate frameworks pushed in lieu of design and architecture.  I am a polyglot (C, Java, SQL, PL/SQL, XPath, JavaScript, XSLT, bash) and enjoy coding in all of them.  I am looking to learn a few more (Python, Lua) giving the time.  When a team pushes something like an ORM in order to be &quot;pure Java&quot; it makes me sad since it is seldom accompanied by rational comparison for design factors and true reasoning.  I make a good living, well above average, since it is our industry that is driving the world economy.  I believe it will continue to do so for some time.  My personal motivation to do insanely great things is nearly expired.  I have not the will to fight for better implementations with my current employment.  I&#x27;m generally too tired at the end of the day to work on my personal projects, but not entirely.  If it were not for the cut in pay, I would love to start teaching programming.  Maybe I can do it part time after retirement.<p>In re-reading my text prior to posting, it seems like a description of burn out.  Perhaps, but I am not unhappy, just unmotivated by the mundane nature of my work.  I work to pay my bills and make it to retirement, not to change the world.

And, the lack of &quot;installation&quot; is a big deal. Many people are utterly helpless with computers and would be terrified of installing everything...and maybe should be. Viruses and malware have proven very difficult to defeat in installable applications, while on the web the risk of poor security is usually concentrated on the developer (or the company the developer works for) rather than the consumer.<p>Further, low bandwidth is a reason to use web apps over installables in a lot of cases, and not the other way around as you suggest. Downloading Office on a slow/expensive link would be horrible. Using Google Docs, not so bad. I work on slow internet most of the time (I travel full-time, and use 3G/4G internet, sometimes with weak connectivity and expensive data); I save my &quot;ooh, I want to download this new game/app&quot; moments for when I&#x27;m somewhere with free/fast wifi. But, I still do lots of work on the web, and I don&#x27;t find GMail/Inbox problematic at all on this slow link. Of course &quot;no Internet&quot; is different from &quot;slow/expensive&quot; Internet, but without Internet, you&#x27;re limited to packaged software purchased at brick and mortar stores, which is not a very wise target market for developers making new stuff, in the general case.",1454344254

Building a new building is usually budgeted in terms of $/sf.

Plus once you sign a lease you have to pay to build out the office. This can easily cost several million dollars in itself.<p>If you&#x27;re a manager making this mutli-million dollar decision, are you going to go with the guaranteed overhead savings of minimizing square footage or are you going to risk millions of dollars on a vague promise of maybe increased productivity?

Obviously, this does them no good to keep it to themselves, because they know that all the chips they make are, by definition, genuine.<p>Logically, the proper thing to do would be to develop a counterfeit detector and distribute it to all reputable intermediaries in the supply chain between them and the customers.  That way, distributors could test the chips before accepting a shipment, and before paying for knockoffs.<p>Instead, FTDI gave the tester to end-users, all the way down at the other end of the supply chain.  Many of these people will not even know what a FTDI is.

These are surface features, and the movement of water and soil happens at a rapid clip when humanity doesn&#x27;t lock it in irons.<p>Natural rivers are usually not static features.  The Mississippi is full of sediment, and strongly inclined towards major floods.  In a natural landscape, those floods deposit mud every time the banks are breached, the banks are constantly degrading, the surrounding areas are swampy, flattened areas that get reshaped on a regular basis.  A natural floodplain-river exists in a dynamic equilibrium, constantly shifting a tiny to medium-sized trickle of water around a vast, deep, soft bed of mud it deposited, only occasionally bumping into the hills (geological or aeolian features usually) bordering the floodplain.<p>What&#x27;s strange and unnatural is that we could draw a line on a map, expect a river to be confined to this line, and reinforce that line with rock walls and soil levies;  That we could dam major portions of the continental watershed in order to regularize water distribution;  That we could drain swamps the size of states and turn them into cropland, or fill prairie or desert with canals to do the same.<p>We have cut off this area from the natural cycles of sedimentation, all but the most extreme &quot;natural disasters&quot; are prevented through intensive engineering began sometime in the 20th century.

11012663,comment,11012410,11012410,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I skimmed part I and will read it all later, but one piece of advice that stuck out to me immediately, that I think is important, is the one where you say &quot;make sure you can afford it&quot;. This I believe is critical to success.<p>Two years ago I was accepted into an accelerator program close to my home. While I did not have to move and was able to commute, it still placed a financial burden on me.<p>A little background context first. Prior to the accelerator starting I had been consulting during the day and working on the startup in my free time and at night/weekends. While I had a little money in the bank and a cushion saved for emergencies, that cushion was meant more for if the bottom falls out of my world and I need to live for 6-7 months with absolutely no income. A little over half of that &quot;emergency&quot; money was tied to non-cash assets that I was willing to depart with (i.e. sell stocks) should my world collapse, but at the same time was easily accessible and could be converted to cash fairly quickly. While this money was separate from long-term retirement planning, and was meant to be accessed with minimal tax burden, I had not intended for it to subsidize my living just to join an accelerator. So my first decision was whether to cash out some emergency money or not, so I could focus on the accelerator and stop consulting.<p>The initial accelerator marketing stated a $10K stipend to each member. However, after being accepted we were informed that this was actually going to be disbursed at intervals. No big deal, but it did play a factor. We were also told that the initial disbursement would be paid within 30 days of acceptance (which just happened to coincide with the first day of the accelerator). So I wasn&#x27;t too worried and figured I could keep my emergency funds intact.<p>The start of the program comes and goes, however, there was no disbursements. As weeks added up, I began questioning the partners as to when the money would be disbursed. By this point I had practically burned through my cash savings and was at the point where I had to make a decision. I could (a) cash out some emergency funds; (b) take on a couple small consulting jobs to make ends meet till the disbursement hit; or (c) quit the accelerator.<p>After the halfway point passed in the accelerator and two disbursement dates had been missed, I put further pressure on the partners, but by this point I was at the breaking point. I kept being told any day now. So I picked up a couple small consulting jobs that I could do in a few hours here and there.<p>By now I had a bad taste in mouth with the program for the disbursements being strung out this long and a complete lack of transparency on the partners behalf. By the time the initial disbursement finally did come I had to use that money to catch up on my bills and expenses that I had incurred directly by participating in the accelerator. But that bad taste lingered even after those disbursements, and when it became apparent that the demo day at the end would not materialize, I ended up just dropping out entirely. I continued with my startup, but had to go back to consulting to ensure my financial well-being.<p>Money may not be able to buy happiness, but it can buy you a whole lot less stress whether you realize it or not. And the less stress you have going on in your outside life, the more you can focus on your startup life. The way this situation played out added a stress that impacted my overall ability to focus on my startup. So instead of being able to use the accelerator as a time to put 100% into my startup, I was left to spending 75% of my time worrying about and making sure I had money for bills and living expenses.<p>Long story short, don&#x27;t count on the money from the program to make ends meet. Be in a financial position to use that money more as a cushion so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your bills/living expenses.",1454343701

11012629,comment,11009641,11011931,0,0,dalke,,,"> where it&#x27;s implemented<p>So how does mail cross the boundary? Assume the US has the system but Canada does not. How will someone from Canada send mail to a US address? More specifically, if you buy something from Amazon, and it&#x27;s actually delivered from a Canadian shipper, how does the shipper know the address if you&#x27;ve only given Amazon your alias?<p>Does that mean this system would restrict Amazon, eBay, etc. to only work with places which are party to the new system?<p>> I already have to go to Easypost to determine shipping cost<p>I assume you rarely ship things. I used to help send book around the US. It&#x27;s media mail. We had a scale, and a price list. We weighed the books, put on the right number of stamps, and dropped the mail off at the post office.<p>There was no &quot;API&quot;. There was no need to go elsewhere to weigh the books.<p>How many similar systems will break with this proposal?<p>> _much_ easier<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. Right now I only need to know the address to have people send things to me. With this proposal, I have to register my mailing address.<p>To give a case in point, last December I did a lot of traveling. I went to CA, NM, OK, and FL. I live in Sweden.<p>In NM my friend in CA pointed out I left my coat there. I asked her to send it to me in OK, where I would be visiting family, as there might not be time for the coat to get to me in NM. I knew the address of where I was driving to in OK, so it was easy to give her that address. Add it&#x27;s easy to find zip code for an address.<p>Otherwise, I either 1) need to get the special shipping code for my relative in OK, or 2) register a one-off mailing code with the USPS. (Because I do <i>not</i> want any of my other addresses updated.)<p>Both are more complicated than putting c/o along with the street address.<p>> I just update the USPS address.<p>Again, my case was a one-off event. Consider a different problem, which is the question of how to disentangle addresses.<p>Suppose I&#x27;ve been married and living in the same place for 25 years. We&#x27;ve registered everything on the same mail code, including Amazon, eBay, credit card notices, bank statements, mortgage statements. Now me and my spouse have decided to celebrate our silver anniversary by living in Hawaii for two months.<p>While in Hawaii, we still want to use Amazon. But our son, who lives next door, will handle any bills or other things. So we want to change the address for Amazon <i>ONLY</i>.<p>How do we do that? I can&#x27;t just update the USPS address because everything will be routed to Hawaii, which I don&#x27;t want.<p>Nor can I tell USPS that when Amazon sends to special code XYZ then to instead ship to an address in Hilo.<p>> I&#x27;m not clear on why that gives cheaper rates these days<p>You don&#x27;t have to be &quot;clear&quot;, only accept that it&#x27;s true. A DuckDuckGo for &quot;presorted mail&quot; points me to <a href=""http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/sorting/presortingMail.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pe.usps.com/businessmail101/sorting/presortingMail.ht...</a> which says &quot;Many mailers choose to presort their mail because it results in lower postage. Because you&#x27;re doing some of the work, it costs the Postal Service less money to process and deliver those pieces of mail. We pass that savings on to you in the form of commercial postage prices. Basically, &quot;presorting&quot; means grouping mail by ZIP Code.&quot;<p>> the USPS should be able to mass sort<p>Your beliefs about the postal system do not appear to be correct, nor have been correct for decades.<p>> this is specifically a system of snail mail aliasing<p>And a system which introduces a lot of headaches for little gain.<p>How do I change an alias? Do I go online? What if it&#x27;s been 10 years and I&#x27;ve forgotten the account details? Do I go to the post office to get access again? Can my spouse change the information? Can I designate someone else, like my lawyer, to change it? How safe is it from identity fraud? What is the legal method of recovering from fraud?<p>What level of privacy will there be on the alias? Can companies share or sell the information? Can the alias-to-physical address be subpoenad? Is the subpoena filed in state or federal court? Does the other side get to file an objection before that information is released?",1454343484

11012556,comment,11010096,11010096,0,0,soylentcola,,,"I can only speak from the customer&#x27;s perspective but I think of Sprint the way I used to think of TMobile:  a more affordable alternative to the children of the Baby Bells (ATT and Verizon) that can offer a better deal since they&#x27;re competing against bigger players.<p>For probably 10 years I used Sprint because they consistently offered the best price and perks despite not having bought up as much coverage in some areas as VZW and ATT.  When I used a flip phone in the early 2000&#x27;s I could get service for dirt cheap.  A few hundred minutes plus a few hundred texts (back when those were itemized money makers for carriers) for $30/mo.  When I got my first smart phone, a Treo 650, unlimited data was another $10 or $15/mo addon which brought my total to around $40-45/mo.<p>I never worried about minutes because Sprint didn&#x27;t count any calls made on weekends, any calls made after 7pm, or even any calls to/from any cell phone of any carrier against your balance.  Early on, the data speeds only allowed me to check email, sync calendars, and stream 128k/s Shoutcast streams in the car but I already felt like it was &quot;futuristic&quot; while friends were paying monthly fees for XM Radio or pricey Blackberry plans.<p>With my second smartphone (an HTC PocketPC running Windows Mobile) I got GPS navigation, unlimited 3G service at around 600-800k/sec, and all the cool stuff that came along with it like the ability to stream live TV from my PC with a tuner card at home.  Data was still unlimited and my monthly bills were under $50.  As a longer-term customer, I got a new phone subsidy every year instead of every two years at a time when there was no real benefit to going without a contract to save money.<p>Coverage in rural areas wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as good as the bigger carriers but I lived in the city and Sprint roamed for free on Verizon towers so I could always make and receive calls.  As the non-early-adopters started buying smartphones, I was always amazed that friends were paying upwards of $90/mo for iPhones on ATT with limited data and 2G speeds.<p>When WiMax debuted, our city was on the list of the initial rollout cities and I was using my phone as a WiFi hotspot to get (at the time) amazing 5-8mbps speeds anywhere I went.  Video calls and live streaming video were now a thing and even though the monthly cost jumped from $45 to $60 it was still cheaper than alternatives.<p>But then they got rid of yearly subsidies.  And the prices went up as they reorganized their tiers so that the cheapest plan I could get included more minutes that I could ever use with no way to buy less.  $80/mo was creeping dangerously close to ATT/VZW prices.  I still had unlimited data but over time, those 5-8mbps speeds weren&#x27;t showing up on my actual phone.  I was in a full coverage area with excellent signal but lucky to break 1mbps during the day.<p>It was a tough time to be a Sprint loyalist as service was becoming more expensive and less reliable.  The tipping point for me was the Nexus 5 and TMobile&#x27;s semi-hidden prepaid options.  In the past Tmo had seemed like it was roughly the same in terms of cost but they had less coverage.  But now I could buy a good phone off contract for $350 and pay only $30/mo for a 5GB data allotment with 100 minutes (which is still more than I use normally but much better than paying for hundreds).<p>When my Sprint contract expired I made the switch over to TMo and cut my bill in half.  I&#x27;ve got WiFi coverage at home and at work so I never go over 5GB these days.  If I run out of minutes for some weird reason, it&#x27;s a quick couple of taps and $10 to add another 100 minutes.  If Tmo ever pisses me off I can just buy a SIM from someone else and be ready to go.  And the only downside is that I get no service in more remote areas.<p>But since I am in the city for 98% of the year, I figured it was a worthwhile tradeoff.  Data speeds are excellent and I&#x27;m not stuck in a contract paying 2-3x as much for unwanted services.  I don&#x27;t know what it will take for Sprint to bounce back short of a TMo-like reinvention.  The problem is that the things that attract me as a customer (cheap, fast, contract-free dumb pipes) are not the things that make loads of money for carriers.  If they are able to leverage the amount of fiber and spectrum they own at good terms for customers, I&#x27;d gladly consider them again.  But for the time being, I haven&#x27;t felt like I was getting this good a deal since my early days with Sprint.",1454342923

I am claiming that Marx does not understand Capital, and just because he claimed to have analysed the role of &#x27;capital&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t mean that he &#x27;understood&#x27; it. A christian biologist writing about the role of fossils doesn&#x27;t mean he understands it.<p>> His careful inspection did not reveal a conspiracy theory; instead, it elucidated the ways capital influences our material existence. <<p>Did Marx not say that the employer is able to claim a right to &#x27;surplus labor&#x27; because the capitalist class (state being one of them) protects this right(property rights)?<p>Does he not claim that almost all property is acquired via theft and coercion of the labor class? I understand that conspiracy theory is a loaded term, but his idea of &#x27;class interest&#x27; is nothing but a conspiracy theory. That somehow all the capitalist are conspiring against the workers, without being explicitly aware of it.<p>Karl Marx did not understand that Capital allows production but doing division of &#x27;labor&#x27;(used here to mean &#x27;tasks&#x27;). Workers don&#x27;t need to invest their time in the production process, and wait for the revenue of a business to pour in, while a person specializing in saving, does the job of providing the wages.<p>That this is a necessary factor needed in any economy and it&#x27;s impossible for any society (including the one recommending by Marx) to live by not having division of capital accumulation from labor.",1454342898

You first expanded &quot;hedge funds&quot; to include everyone looking to make a buck; then you said counterparties are easy to find for all these money looking to short. I don&#x27;t see how that can be logically consistent. If everyone intending to short finds a long to match at the current price, why would that bother the PBoC?<p>As I said I believe the hedge funds bets against the yuan are relatively safe. I believe this is the case because they are working for the PBoC, not against it. The PBoC apparently would not mind the yuan to weaken over time. It just doesn&#x27;t want it too quickly or disorderly. It wants to give time to companies that borrowed in USD to bet on yuan appreciation to unwind but it does not want to freak out retail savers to jump on the same trade so it is a delicate position. One can debate if such a policy is wise but I don&#x27;t think it is at all like the all powerful hedgies put a gun to the PBoC&#x27;s head. Having the offshore yuan trade lower actually provides political cover for the PBoC in Washington. It is just that herding cats can be challenging.",1454342580

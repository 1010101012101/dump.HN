Recession is the predictable, brief, and necessary period of creative destruction and contraction in a functioning economy. It causes some people to get laid off, but they usually get better jobs within 1-3 years, and the economy as a whole improves. This is something else, and will have a long-term scarring effect on the nation.<p>The fact that ""petty"" means both small (which this one is, as far as depressions go) and mean-spirited (price-gouging on housing with young families at the barrel-end) means it fits surprisingly well.",1270310270

Our brain generates predictions of likely visual inputs so it can focus on dealing with the unexpected.<p>Predictable sights trigger less brain activity than unfamiliar stimuli, bolstering the view that the brain is not merely reactive, but generates predictions based on the recent past. ""The brain expects to see things and really just wants to confirm it now and again,"" says Lars Muckli at the University of Glasgow, UK.<p>He and Arjen Alink at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt, Germany, asked 12 volunteers to focus on a cross on a screen, above and below which bars flashed on and off to create the illusion of movement. To test a predictable stimulus, a third bar would appear in a position timed to fit in with the illusion of smooth movement. For the unpredictable stimulus it would appear out of sync. fMRI scans showed that the unpredictable stimulus increased the activity in parts of the brain which deal with the earliest stages of visual processing (Journal of Neuroscience, vol 30, p 2960).<p>The finding supports the ""Bayesian brain"" theory, which sees the brain as making predictions about the world which it updates when new information comes in.",1270309579

First off, <a href=""http://nutritiondata.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nutritiondata.com</a> is a valuable resource - I treat the body as a machine with certain fuel requirements. The key ones are fiber, protein and calories. You need to know your input profile or you're just guessing. Next, pick a few dishes that satisfy this profile. I eat a bowl of carrots a whole can of corn (canned corn is a GREAT fiber per $ ratio if you buy it in bulk) and a large protein shake. Next up is a vitamin, which is absolutely crucial for micronutrients. If you let veggies + protein be the centerpiece of your diet (that is my breakfast) then the rest of the day tends to fall around it, because the bulk makes you less hungry and your body has what it needs. I'd also recommend you workout at least 3 days a week if you don't already - body maintenance is not optional for optimum performance.<p>If you honestly are saying ONE hour is too much time for a full day of quality cooking?

Millions of people still use them.<p>In fact, writing at all while standing or sitting without a stable surface in front of you is pretty awkward, and with a normal notebook/laptop, it's damn near impossible because of the bulk of the thing.",1270306865

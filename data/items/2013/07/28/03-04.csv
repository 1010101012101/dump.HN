It demonstrates the ability to hold a huge amount of information in your head at once, make rapid decisions in a high pressure environment, and do what are essentially Bayesian probability calculations in your head. I may be biased as someone that played poker to put myself through grad school and had a nice hourly rate by the end of it, but I think that it requires a high intelligence, the ability to emotionally disconnect from decisions, and the ability to retain and act on such large amounts of information that it&#x27;s a definite positive.

If they screw up your immune response down the road, it&#x27;s still better than dying now.  I need to be clear that I&#x27;m not talking about this specific case but the general practice of fighting what are believed to be &quot;bad germs&quot; using techniques that can be expected to screw up the human microbiome and, as a result, weaken the body&#x27;s immune function, making it more susceptible to exploitation by opportunistic pathogens.<p>As scythe wrote,<p>> That is to say: the six bacterial strains ... carrying the most severe antibiotic resistance and responsible for the worst infections are the very same strains present all around us naturally. However, in every case except S aureus, <i>infection is basically unheard of when an individual has a functioning immune system;</i> they are all opportunistic pathogens. [Emphasis mine]<p>Right now, the emphasis in medical practice is on attacking the &quot;bad germs.&quot; What is mostly ignored is cultivating robust immune function, which as scythe points out would mostly <i>prevent</i> opportunistic pathogens from doing harm in the first place.  That&#x27;s probably because until recently nobody knew much about improving immune function.  But now, with a better understanding of the human microbiome, it&#x27;s becoming hard to ignore that the techniques used to fight the bad germs (e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics) are probably also having harmful effects on the human microbiome and, as a consequence, immune function.  So the short-term fix is likely to also cause long-term problems.<p>To give you an example of what I&#x27;m concerned about, let me share what happened to my wife a few months ago.  She had a rash on her lower leg, near her ankle, and went to see her general practitioner.  Her GP didn&#x27;t know what the rash was but nevertheless prescribed an anti-itch cream and -- surprise! -- a course of antibiotics, &quot;just in case.&quot;  (It turned out that the rash was mild poison ivy, so the antibiotics would have done nothing to help.)  For many practicing doctors, broad-spectrum antibiotics are used like this as a general prophylactic for all manner of minor ailments.  Lots of people are having their microbiomes decimated for very little benefit.<p>> Sure, taking an antibiotic deranges your microbiome, but doesn&#x27;t it seem to most of the time readjust?<p>By what mechanism would eliminated strains be repopulated?  And if they weren&#x27;t repopulated and if your microbiome didn&#x27;t &quot;readjust,&quot; how could you tell?  After all, even if such derangements were permanent, we would not expect to observe them until they were challenged by opportunistic pathogens and exploited.  It could be, therefore, that such derangements have an invisible cumulative effect: the more screwed up your microbiome becomes the more at risk you are, but unaware of it until you get sick.",1374982396

I&#x27;m not talking about lobbying or raising attention to the issue, but the technical challenges of designing a network that is immune to all forms of surveillance. Let&#x27;s treat this as an issue of computer science, not politics.<p>Now I&#x27;m not claiming that this will be easy (and it may not even be possible), but this whole episode has made me seriously reconsider my long-term career direction in terms of the type of research I want to be doing. Pioneers like Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn created the &quot;Internet 1&quot; so to speak, and everything since then has been building on that. There&#x27;s been plenty of projects that have worked towards getting around these surveillance measures (Tor for example), and I think we need more things like this.<p>We need to fundamentally rethink the design of the Internet, because the current design is broken. Just like TCP/IP provides the infrastructure to abstract over different networking technologies and physical links (and the failure/slowness of individual links), we need something that abstracts over the basic, unencrypted (or encrypted but subject to centralised sabotage, like SSL) communication layer. Something that third parties <i>can&#x27;t</i> intercept, at least not with anything like the ease with which they do today. It never ceases to amaze me, for example, that email is still unencrypted by default, and we don&#x27;t have public-key cryptography built in to every mail client and turned on by default.<p>Most importantly, we need more distribution, and to stop relying on centralised service providers, who are necessarily subject to the laws of the country in which they operate (see: recent articles discussing impacts of the issue on US cloud firms operating in foreign markets). Facebook should be a protocol, not a service. Twitter should be a protocol, not a service. And so forth. This of course completely upends the business model these technologies are based on, and would need to be approached by people with a completely different perspective.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t have the answers to these questions. But it&#x27;s made me curious and it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll be giving a great deal of thought to in the coming years.<p>As Albert Einstein once said: &quot;We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them&quot;.",1374981113

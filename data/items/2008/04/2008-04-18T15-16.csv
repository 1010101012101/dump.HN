167314,comment,167255,167288,0,0,ejs,,,"From someone who exercises a good amount (usually 5-6 days a week for 1-2 hours at a time) I never really believe in exercise for weight loss.<p>The math just doesnt work out, go and run hardcore for about 3 miles at 250 lbs bodyweight and you are looking at burning about 500 calories. While thats a good amount its the same as maybe 2 bottles of soda. Its a lot easier to cut out 100 calories from 5 meals then to run 3 miles...<p>So I never advocate exercise for weight loss purposes as much as diet. I greatly advocate exercise for all the other benefits plus the motivation it helps with in dieting.<p>Really as someone else stated, if you are overweight you need to make a lifestyle change. Cut out all the crap esp empty calories like soda (sugar) pastries, and other junk.",1208534387

167312,comment,167255,167306,0,0,scott_s,,,"I also think that for many people strength training can be more fun, and consequently, are more likely to continue doing it. It's more visceral than most cardio, and the goal/reward system of increasing weight and reps gives faster gratification.<p>Part of the problem is that most people have no idea how to do the basic lifts, and most personal trainers don't teach them. Another problem is a basic lack of structure, which is why I advocate focusing on the basic lifts: bench, squat, deadlift and maybe clean & press.<p>Doing both cardio and strength training is important, but I think most people already understand the basics of cardio.",1208534375

You can go to (<a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com</a>) for articles. He takes a geek approach to nutrition, and talks extremely straight about it, and bases all his conclusions on science and research.<p>There are many myths and pieces of information out there on dieting. Yes, keeping protein intake up, to a point that many people would even consider disgusting, is important. It's ultimately pure thermodynamics: eating less than you burn. However, it is a big mistake to try and do too much in the gym. The eating is by far the most important part of the equation.<p>Another big key is that certain diet patterns are much easier to follow. Low carb works very well for me (after a week or two of adjustment where I'm absolutely fried). Once it's locked in, all cravings for high carb and junk foods just disappear. But I have to be careful, because any break from this leads to extreme temptation again.",1208534374

Along with that I try to keep in check what I am eating. Eating breakfast is a big thing cause it gets your metabolism going in the morning. For lunch instead of a whole sandwich I eat half a sandwich and some fruit and a yogurt. For dinner I try to keep red meat to special occasions and eat more chicken and fish. I also try to make smarter choices like salad with dressing on the side instead of french fries. Thats about it.<p>Edit: I also don't drink soda, diet or regular.",1208533721

It takes probably about 15 minutes of running to counteract that.<p>So, to balance those scales of calorie intake (or tip them into your favour) focus on eating better and drink mostly water, coffees and teas.<p>Exercise is a must.

It's hard work being an entrepreneur, and I'm glad that you guys are getting some good press.<p>But, I do have a problem with how it seems that these businesses are being selected.  It seems that the level of funding that these people raised is used as a hallmark of how good the entrepreneur is.  Isn't the mark of a good entrepreneur how much they can do with how little?<p>I can understand why a video company like Video Egg might need a high capitalization.  Bandwidth charges for video streaming are high.  But, I'd still balk at taking $27 million in funding.<p>Etsy--31 million in funding.  Granted, the company has 1 million users and 75,000 sellers.  But really, 31 million dollars!  What does an e-commerce site need 31 million for?<p>I've actually begun to see taking large sums of VC money as a competitive disadvantage.  If these companies take $20-30 million in funding, the VC's are going to push for a 10x return.  That means that their investors are wanting a $200-300 million exit.  And, even at those rates, I'd imagine that the founders shares are quite diluted by that point.<p>And, I'd guess that the chances of getting a $200-300 exit are a lot slimmer than getting a $5-6 million exit.

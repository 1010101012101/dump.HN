The boss has absolutely no right to judge the next company. Everyone moves around in the tech world. MS employees joined Google, then Facebook, then Amazon, and so on. Bosses are supposed to wish employees good luck in the future or at the very least be polite and respectful.<p>> And Jason said something in the heat of the moment? So what?<p>So TechCrunch. So permanent record & documentation. So bad PR.  People in the IT/startup world should know the internet never forgets. Also there is no heat of the moment when you reply to an email titled ""Resignation."" I can believe heat of the moment if an employee walks into your office and says ""Screw you! I quit."" But you can't play the ""heat of the moment"" card if it's an email. Take some time to cool off before you reply.<p>> They just promoted the guy and he can't even sit down and have a conversation?<p>Irrelevant to the discussion. He could have been made CTO and still wanted to resign. It was a very polite email and it is a free country/world. As a boss, you need to be a good leader and say positive things even when someone wants to quit.<p>> I'd be horribly disappointed too. Remember ""disappointed"" means you actually care and had high hopes/expectations for that person. That's WAY better than no expectations whatsoever.<p>I'd be horribly disappointed too myself. But saying ""horribly disappointed"" is not constructive criticism or even a poor choice of words. It is outright insulting. Instead of going back and forth over these words, let me just write out what an appropriate reply should be, so you can decide yourself how far this is from what really happened:<p><pre><code>    Hi Evan,\n\n    I accept your resignation and have notified Elliot to take care of the paperwork tomorrow. You can take the next two weeks off and have someone pick up your personal belongings or let Elliot know where to ship them.\n\n    I had high hopes for you and am disappointed to see you leave. Good luck with your future ventures.\n</code></pre>\nThere. Said nearly the same things without sounding rude or insulting. Senior employees resigning can't possibly be such a common occurrence that a CEO can't even take 2mins to think the reply through. Could it?",1272260754

Nobody has that right - not my parents, not my wife, not my boss, not my friends, NOBODY. I am very compassionate and understanding. If you are nice to me and reason with me, I will climb mountains for you. If I make the smallest mistake, I will man up and apologize before you even know something's up. But if you yell at me, I walk away regardless of whose fault it is. I am an adult, treat me as such with respect and dignity.<p>Also, I've noticed that yelling is a VERY good indicator of the morale of an office environment. I can't much speak for warehouse/construction-type jobs where yelling might in fact be the rule but I have not once seen happy employees in a place where managers or CEOs can yell at anyone they so choose.

No matter what excuses you give yourself for your crappy behavior, are you losing really good employees because they don't agree with you on this issue?  After you've thought about it for a while, perhaps you'll find better ways to handle stress than yelling at people below you in the hierarchy.",1272258305

Keyboard-based controls, monsters that moved around, etc. All done in cross-browser compatible javascript.<p>It used a hidden iframe to poll the map data asynchronously (this was way before AJAX) and update the tiles (a 32x32 grid) in real time. I posted it on a popular forum one day, and had a whole bunch of people moving around on the map together. It was so awesome to see my little world come to life. People hadn't seen anything like it.<p>Then the server admin killed my account. Shared hosting was all I could afford back then.<p>I kept working on it for a while on my local machine, but without a place to host it, I lost motivation. It really needed a dedicated server, and that was way beyond my just-out-of-highschool budget.<p>Anyway, I ended up going to college and never really got back to it. 8 years later, I no longer have the source, or even a screenshot.",1272258017

870505,comment,870287,870287,0,0,nobody_nowhere,,,"Here's what I'd do as a non-lawyer:<p>1. Write down the agreement you'd like to make in the plainest possible terms. Use simple English and structure the document logically.  Cover all the bases -- what you want to happen now, and in the future.  Describe your theoretical idea as best you can.<p>If you don't want each other to be able to compete in the future, write it down.  But bear in mind that depending on where you are, you might not be able to force each other to agree to things like that.<p>2. I'm not a lawyer, but lawyers have told me to do the following things in agreements I've written:  Describe which state's law covers the agreement in case you disagree about it later.  Include the fact that the document is your entire agreement, and you don't have any other agreements on the subject outside of the document.   Include something that says if any small part of the agreement becomes invalid for any reason (like the competition bit), the rest of the agreement is still valid.<p>3. Make two copies. Each of you sign and date both and  keep one.<p>4. If you change your mind, make a new document that references your initial agreement (e.g., ""this is an amendment to our agreement of Oct 8 2009"") and spell out the changes in simple terms.<p>That's probably the best you can do without spending any money on a lawyer.  Think of it this way -- if you have a disagreement in the future you want something you can point to and say ""this is what we agreed to, it's very clear"".  Don't try to fancy it up too much.",1255057100

It <i>does</i> matter whether or not we are dependent on oil domestically. Currently oil runs through our economy like woven thread. You raise oil prices and that causes immediate inflation because production and delivery of products depends on oil. With an economy that is 2/3 dependent on consumer spending you don't want steep price inflation. That's why it would be a benefit to not be as reliant on oil domestically.

The result is that people tend to either enter into highly emotional shouting matches devoid of reason or logic (fight) or they shut down, stay quiet and try to ride out the ""attack"" (flight).

870465,comment,870338,870338,0,0,yan,,,"Wait. What?<p>1) Is he implying that launching a perl interpreter is somehow a more lightweight operation than launching ls and having it stat() half a dozen files? Having ls check if a file exists 99% of the time won't even touch the disk. If you're working in that directory, those inodes will probably be cached. Running stat() on a cached inode is hardly more expensive than a system call. Read: cheap. Now perl launching will probably load a few libs and check a few files before even getting to his one-liner.<p>2) Am I the only one, who in my ~10 years of running unix-like operating systems have <i>never</i> created a filename with a newline char in it? Like even when opening obscure filesystems, never.<p>3) Does he think unlink() skips the check for the file's existence?<p>4) If he wanted to overcomplicate things and <i>make sure</i> everything's kosher, why not:<p><pre><code>  find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.c' -delete

[1] To put it into some perspective, it eclipses aggregate web advertising revenue ... which is also declining. [2]<p>Newspapers -- and magazines -- have a couple of problems, and the web isn't really one of them.  Their first problem is that their revenue model relies most heavily on both subscriptions and advertising.  In the case of advertising, a market saturation is probably in effect, with advertising revenue falling for multiple industries and media.  People are spending less right now, so advertising is less effective; however, people are also getting sick of being bombarded by non-relevant ads on billboards, bus stops, magazines, the newspapers, their mail, their email, and their websites. (Hey TechCrunch: by the way, could you possibly fit a few more jumpy/blinky/changey ads on your site? Thanks.)<p>Subscriptions are down too, and this is where the web does hurt them: they're expected to put their content online, for free.  So, why should consumers pay for a newspaper if they can get the same items over their computer for free?<p>Attempts so far to carry the subscription model over to the web have been, if not unsuccessful, then not successful either.  Large numbers of people balk even at the New York Times' registration requirement for much of its content.<p>The web isn't nearly as de-centralized as this article would like to dream; although there's plenty of political news available from Wonkette or Daily Kos, the bulk of current events journalism is still funneled through publications which have the resources to pay for journalists.  Although the quality of investigative journalism can be debated, its cost cannot: it is expensive, beyond the reach of most bloggers or content aggregation startups.<p>Readers, meanwhile, are definitely pushing for more interactive content -- the ability to leave comments on news stories, for example -- as well as the ability to concentrate their news feeds to select subjects or other criteria, as a natural result of the information overload that some people are suffering from.<p>So, news publications need a new revenue model, and they need to improve their services for readers.  Readers want more up-to-the-minute content, better quality in their content, and narrowed to certain subjects or other interests, and they want it for free.<p>And advertisers need something that consumers might actually want to look at once in a while.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/newspaper_industry_ad_revenue.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/newspaper_industry_ad_revenue.p...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.dmnews.com/first-half-web-ad-spend-down-53-to-109-billion-say-iab-pricewaterhousecoopers/article/151505/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dmnews.com/first-half-web-ad-spend-down-53-to-109...</a>",1255054014

However I am also a person with many additional interests and desires, such as playing sports, reading, art, and music and since each of those are deep areas of interest themselves, they all occupy parts of my non-working life, while being balanced with my family.<p>There are plenty of people who feel this way. They are well balanced individuals who are effective at their jobs, and passionate about them.  But there are only so many hours in a day.  Working isn't just about time spent coding.  It is about working well in a team, and relating with your customers, and understanding social issues as well as technical ones.  Someone who only codes is simply more likely to be underdeveloped in one of those areas.<p>It is just a stupid qualifier.  If you are hiring a marketer, would you only hire someone who telemarkets from home on their off time because they enjoy it?  That's just stupid.<p>Someone who has side projects at home -might- be a more experienced developer.  Or they could be a poorly rounded individual.  Someone who doesn't work on side projects at home -might- be non-passionate.  Or they might be very passionate and effective, and simply more well rounded.  To say you would always require one or the other is just dumb.",1255053683

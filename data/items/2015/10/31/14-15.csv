Odersky is spending most of his time on Dotty these days and he doesn&#x27;t seem that interested in Scala any more, except when he&#x27;s obligated to talk about it at keynotes (and he tends to talk more about Dotty there anyway). Despite the grandiose plans of possibly back porting Dotty features to Scala at some point in the distant future, Scala has been in maintenance mode for a couple of years now and with more and more people leaving the core team, it&#x27;s probably going to stay this way.<p>Such a missed opportunity.",1446303489

And, sure, the\nmedian of three approach to selecting a\npivot value is an approximation to the\nmedian we really want and, thus, a\nrelatively good pivot value.  So this\napproach to selecting a pivot value\npromises on average to get faster average\nrunning times.  Fine.  Faster on average\nis good.  Terrific.<p>But this pivot selection rule says next to\nnothing about worst case running time, and,\nfor claiming worst case running time of O(\nn ln(n) ), this is a biggie issue.<p>Third, with this median of three approach\nto selecting pivot values, we can think of\n<i>bad</i> arrays of input keys that will cause\nquicksort to run in time no faster than O(\nn^2 ). Then maybe we can think of other\nways to select pivot values that result in\na new version of quicksort, a version that\nruns in O( n ln(n) ) again on the bad\narrays.  But with this change, here&#x27;s the\nproblem:  We are lacking a proof that the\nworst case running time of the new version\nof quicksort has worst case running time\nof O( n ln(n) ).<p>That is, our new version of quicksort is\ngood for some old cases of <i>bad</i> arrays\nbut may have created for itself some new\ncases of <i>bad</i> arrays.  So, with no proof,\nthe new version of quicksort may also have\nworst case running time of O( n^2 ) like\nthe old version did.  The main difference\nmight be that the <i>bad</i> arrays for the new\nversion are more complicated to construct\nthan the bad arrays for the old case.<p>But I just looked at the file README.MD\nyou suggested.  I see two issues:<p>First Issue:<p>> When a new pivot is chosen it&#x27;s compared\nto the greatest element in the partition\nbefore it. If they compare equal we can\nderive that there are no elements smaller\nthan the chosen pivot. When this happens\nwe switch strategy for this partition, and\nfilter out all elements equal to the\npivot.<p>If I understand this statement correctly,\nI suspect that for some arrays of input\nkeys, the resulting algorithm won&#x27;t\nactually sort the keys.  That is, we won&#x27;t\nhave a sorting algorithm.<p>Second Issue:<p>> While this technically still allows for\na quadratic worst case, the chances of it\nhappening are astronomically small.<p>For proving worst case running time of O(\nn ln(n) ), &quot;astronomically small&quot; is\nirrelevant.  Maybe your remark\n&quot;astronomically small&quot; is just a side\ncomment and not relevant to PDQSORT having\nworst case running time of O( n ln(n) ),\nbut from your documentation I can&#x27;t easily\ntell.<p>> A bad partition occurs when the position\nof the pivot after partitioning is under\n12.5% (1/8th) percentile or over 87,5%\npercentile - the partition is highly\nunbalanced.  When this happens we will\nshuffle four elements at fixed locations\nfor both partitions.  This effectively\nbreaks up many patterns.  If we encounter\nmore than log(n) bad partitions we will\nswitch to heap sort.<p>For this and the associated documentation,\nI don&#x27;t see a solid argument that PDQSORT\nhas worst case running time of O( n ln(n) ).<p>For some work, a big-O guarantee on worst\ncase performance is a biggie, as in\ncrucial to human life.  Such a guarantee\nis essentially a theorem in applied math\ncalled <i>computer science</i>.  A good example\nof how to prove such theorems is, of\ncourse, in D. Knuth, <i>The Art of Computer\nProgramming, Volume 3, Sorting and\nSearching</i>.<p>Again, I have been happy just to use heap\nsort and forget about looking for anything\nfaster on average.",1446302846

10482776,comment,10482209,10482416,0,0,vidarh,,,"New York defines this differently. From an article about Kalief Browder[1] who spent 3 years at Rikers before charges were just dropped (he subsequently committed suicide):<p>> Many states have so-called speedy-trial laws, which require trials to start within a certain time frame. New York State’s version is slightly different, and is known as the “ready rule.” This rule stipulates that all felony cases (except homicides) must be ready for trial within six months of arraignment, or else the charges can be dismissed. In practice, however, this time limit is subject to technicalities. The clock stops for many reasons—for example, when defense attorneys submit motions before trial—so that the amount of time that is officially held to have elapsed can be wildly different from the amount of time that really has. In 2011, seventy-four per cent of felony cases in the Bronx were older than six months.<p>> In order for a trial to start, both the defense attorney and the prosecutor have to declare that they are ready; the court clerk then searches for a trial judge who is free and transfers the case, and jury selection can begin. Not long after Browder was indicted, an assistant district attorney sent the court a “Notice of Readiness,” stating that “the People are ready for trial.” The case was put on the calendar for possible trial on December 10th, but it did not start that day. On January 28, 2011, Browder’s two-hundred-and-fifty-eighth day in jail, he was brought back to the courthouse once again. This time, the prosecutor said, “The People are not ready. We are requesting one week.” The next court date set by the judge—March 9th—was not one week away but six.<p>... and so it continued. He went to court 31 times.

I also think that it should not be permissible to lower the severity of the charges for the purposes of a plea. If a reduction of charges is offered in a plea, it should automatically be applied to a jury trial as well.<p>Edit: Also worth mentioning, the judge rejected my blind plea (a plea of guilty with no agreement in place with the prosecution) at the first hearing on what I believe was the fourth day of my confinement.

So in many cases the messages sent through our services are automatically deleted from our servers once we detect that they have been viewed or have expired. And again in most cases, the services are programmed to delete a message from the recipient’s device once it’s been viewed or expired as well.<p>There are some exceptions though to this rule. Some of our services, such as My Story, Replay, and Live, allow users to interact with the messages and content you provide through the services for a longer period of time. That means those messages and content may be available on our servers and a recipient’s device after they’ve been viewed or expired. For example, if you add a Snap to My Story, other users will be able to view it for roughly 24 hours. And because Snaps submitted to Live and other crowd-sourced Stories are inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, we may save them indefinitely and allow them to be viewed again through any of our services or third-party sources.&quot;<p>It seems like they&#x27;ve put in the new language so they can try to monetize their Live service, which should be expected (and users already give implicit permission to the company by sending a snap to them to display publicly).

10482695,comment,10482577,10482577,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think the crux of it is that people don&#x27;t expect Snapchats to become public.  They expect them to be more like text messages where there&#x27;s an expectation of privacy.  When a user posts on Facebook, there&#x27;s an expectation that the content is out there for people to see.  If you post a public video on YouTube, you expect people to see it.  If you uploaded a video on YouTube, there&#x27;s an expectation that the local news might show it.  But no one expects the local news to show an embarrassing Snapchat you sent to your friends.<p>But even Facebook&#x27;s TOS is a lot kinder.  &quot;This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.&quot;  Most people don&#x27;t re-share photos.  They comment and tag them, but if you delete the photo, Facebook&#x27;s license to it ends.  They can&#x27;t then give that photo to a news paper because they no longer have a license to it.<p>Similarly, YouTube&#x27;s TOS has a similar provision.  &quot;The above licenses granted by you in video Content you submit to the Service terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your videos from the Service.&quot;  If you delete content from YouTube, they&#x27;re license to the content terminates within a commercially reasonable time after you delete it.<p>So, both Facebook and YouTube let you terminate the content license even though there&#x27;s a better assumption about the content being public.  People have been using Snapchat assuming they can&#x27;t be made public if they ran for Congress or something.  In fact, while people might have seen stupid YouTube or Facebook posts from them, if they only retained a bookmark and didn&#x27;t save a copy, they could delete those embarrassing moments before their run and terminate that license.  In fact, because receiving users see Snapchat as ephemeral, they&#x27;re much more likely to save a copy of the image using a screenshot than Facebook users are.

That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve all kind of decided, and I don&#x27;t think anyone is suggesting people take justice into their own hands.<p>If we agree on that, it should be clear there are limits - the &quot;state&quot; isn&#x27;t some omnipotent, omniscient being.  It can&#x27;t provide absolute justice, if we even knew what that was.  There are going to need to be compromises.<p>Plea bargaining represents a failure on both counts.  The state isn&#x27;t providing justice; it&#x27;s meting out punishment without determining guilt.  And it&#x27;s similarly a failure that justice is too expensive; too unattainable - &quot;we&quot; made the rules, and apparently, voters via congress have made that process unreasonably expensive. The solution isn&#x27;t to give just 3% of the people justice it&#x27;s to be more realistic in our expectations so everyone gets a fair shot at justice.  It shouldn&#x27;t even be an <i>option</i> to deny people their day in court.<p>I bet that if it were illegal to detain people for more than some limited amount of time before a hearing, and a few nice and gruesome murderers walked voters would get their priorities straight.",1446300225

We&#x27;ve gone from fists, to stick and rocks, to spears, to swords, to Greek Fire, to gunpowder, to nuclear weapons. Why not now be the ones to own the power to take down any computer or network?<p>Great efforts in defense aren&#x27;t necessarily successful or rewarded either, e.g. Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;/SDI <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative</a> which was widely criticized and failed miserably.<p>While cyberdefense is not in the same unrealistic realm as SDI was in the 80s, the ways that most people think about security- firewall on the perimeter and/or securing each node, pen testing, patches, and locking down what can be installed/used- don&#x27;t really solve the problem of having a wide attack vector. Imagine if you could shoot a single soldier out in the field and it would kill his/her whole battalion, the base in which he/she was stationed, and perhaps destroy or weaken the entire army or even armed forces to which he/she belonged? That is the situation now.<p>Playing ultimate defense requires much more isolation. We shouldn&#x27;t be on the same network, we shouldn&#x27;t always be connected, and we should really limit how the outside world can affect each node. That isn&#x27;t often the case with the networks we have currently.",1446300225

I think it is not, by a long shot.<p>Free markets are chaotic and thus people especially non-producers are scared form it. However, history showed us clearly central planners (especially  Russian style) no matter what they tried it failed miserably and unlike free markets results were often measured by death toll. Markets are much more local and distributed. It has a huge advantage over central systems. Big Corporations with political ties harm free markets a great deal, but even than I say it fares better.<p>Many suggested with better technology central planning would have an edge, my counter claim is that with better technology free markets will have a further advantage.",1446300187

I might even use it, if there are enough high quality participants.<p>I read the whole Theory page and it struck me as blah blah blah blah blah, <i>except</i> for these two points:<p>1. Conversations on topics you want, going on right now;\n2. Karma keeps the quality high.<p>To me those are the core, and they're a pretty cool core. If I were you I'd strip everything else out. And emphasize those two things on the main page.<p>Personally, I'd drop the recommendation system, or at least drop talking about it. There's so much tripe surrounding that kind of thing that, when I read it, I noticed that your credibility instantly dropped in my mind. I'd rather you put your effort into making it really easy for me to browse/search what's going on so that I can make my <i>own</i> choices. Recommendations won't make me want to use your site if there isn't a lot of value there already. And if you do develop a kick-ass way of recommending related stuff, don't talk to me about it, just show me a few suggestions unobtrusively and I'll eventually catch on.<p>I also like the slogan ""chat rooms that really work"".<p>Edit: on reflection, I seem to notice a pattern which, if it really is there, I suggest you avoid like the plague. It is the idea of the system being ""intelligent"". It comes out in details like your choice of the word ""Theory"" and the title of this post, as well as in the emphasis on the recommendation system and its overtones of AI. To me this is a big turn-off. I don't <i>want</i> a chatting system, and I certainly don't want an ""intelligent"" chatting system. What I want is intelligent conversation. It seems to me you've got the kernel of something that could actually offer me that, which could be genuinely valuable. Focus on that and try to get the system <i>out</i> of the way.<p>Edit 2: while it's fresh in my memory... I noticed another thought going through my mind which was, ""I wonder who is on here that I know from somewhere else"", like HN for example. I wonder if people would be willing to link their user names to their names from other communities. I would, if I knew that lots of other people from HN were talking about stuff on your site.",1217918821

The fact that every module relies upon dozens of other modules meant that your life sucked when one of the dependencies crapped out during an ubermodule install. You'd have to trace down where, what and why the dependency was broken and the idiosyncratic nature of Perl didn't help much with fixing things. Tearing my hair out during another aborted CPAN install was one of the reasons I switched to Python in 2001. Python came with its own set of issues but at the time they seemed more appealing than dealing with amateur hour on CPAN.",1217918462

267222,comment,267170,267170,0,0,helveticaman,,,"""Not to say that getting rich is simply a matter of having a swell attitude. The path to riches usually involves the kind of risk that would make most people feel a little queasy. Harrison Group head Jim Taylor recently persuaded more than 3,000 pentamillionaires to discuss their path to success. Perhaps not surprisingly, none of them had a cushy union job down at the DMV. <i>The vast majority — 80% — either started their own business or worked for a small company that saw explosive growth.</i> And almost all of them made their fortune in a big lump sum after many years of effort.""<p>The article mentions the other 20% is made up of heirs (10%) and fortunes from passive income / stock picking.  The other 80% made it from startups.  Of course, this leaves out the career ladder; don't MBAs get rich too?  I don't envy them, but I know they exist, and I know they have money, as do MDs and JDs.  Where do they fit in?<p>Also:<p>""Getting rich also requires a certain amount of stubbornness and clarity of purpose. Consultant Joel Kurtzman, who evaluated 350 startups for his book Startups That Work, found that <i>successful outlets usually have a team of two or three founders who share a common vision; the success rate for this model was a remarkable 50%. The odds for solo founders were more like the oft-quoted one in 10, in part because they often found themselves working at cross-purposes with hired guns who see things differently.</i> That's what 34-year-old Justin Jarvinen learned the hard way. The entrepreneur saw two promising business ventures go down the tubes after he took on partners who tweaked his ideas beyond recognition. But three years ago he started VerveLife, a service that helps companies promote online marketing efforts with free music downloads. Knowing that his success depended on his enthusiasm for bringing the idea to market, he carefully chose partners who supported his vision.""<p>So, according to this article:\n80% of people who get rich do so w/ a startup\n50% of good teams succeed\n10% of solo founders succeed",1217917314

I can tell you think so too, but I'd bet you're even smarter (relatively) than you realize.  I agree that if you follow your plan, you're likely to be successful, if you don't give up just a bit too soon and go back to the solid, dependable paychecks.<p>My only two cents concerns your patience.  I'll admit, my only experience working for someone else was a year-long internship right after college, but despite it being a sweet gig in a beautiful place, I hated it, and it was all I could do to make it to the end of the year.  Since then, it's been only startups for me, and it's so incomparably different and better that I just have to weigh in that your 3 year plan is a little too patient and risk-averse for me.<p>It sounds like you love your job already.  That's definitely key. But if you wait another 3 years to go for it, and find out you're fantastic at it and are having the time of your life, won't it seem like you should have given it a go even sooner?  For instance, by getting a cofounder willing to pay the company bills for a while as an even trade for your fantastic ideas? Seems worth considering if you'd both rather start sooner than later.  Making your own stuff full time is so <i>fun</i>.",1217917100

If you can sell 1% of your company to an entity that adds 2% to the value, it's a good bet.<p>Regarding:<p>""The point is, if it's easy enough to avoid, why not just save up the money, and then do it?""<p>Here's why not.  You take 2 years to save your money and then roll the dice.  If you win big, you get 100% of your exit.  If you lose, you spend all of your money.  If you raise money, you get more funds than you'll save in 2 years.  If you spend it carefully, presumably this will up your chance for success.  If you win big, you get 75% of your exit.  If you lose, you spend all of someone else's money.  And you don't spent two years of a finite life doing something that doesn't turn your crank.  :-)  Add to that that the fact right investor(s) increase your tiny chance of success by a little bit without requiring that you give up any creative control...<p>Well, there are lots of good reasons.<p>I'm not disagreeing with the path you're on-- it just seems like you dismissed the alternative for the wrong reasons.",1217916366

6000988,comment,6000776,6000868,2,0,saraid216,,,"Effectively, no judgement is <i>ever</i> really final. This is because, in a democracy, we must constantly acknowledge that our judgement could be wrong. Separation of powers, as you correctly describe it, manifests that acknowledgement by providing an avenue to contradict every action. Congress can pass a stupid law, but the President can refuse to sign it and the SCOTUS can deem it unconstitutional. The President can sign a stupid order, but Congress can impeach him. SCOTUS can make a stupid decision, but the President can refuse to acknowledge it and Congress can rewrite the rules.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>easy</i> in any case, and there are a lot of hoops to jump through. Generally speaking, each branch declines to take their nuclear option by acknowledging the implicit threat available and compromising beforehand. Obamacare and DOMA are both recent and useful case studies for this interplay; ignore the content and the rhetoric and just look at the mechanics of what each entity did and when and why.",1373169531

As lifeguard mentions, publishers tend to require tremendous resources from authors, by way of huge marketing pushes/travel, blogging, promotion, marketing, etc. I&#x27;m not so well informed about the cost of production via publishers, nor the buy-back of unpurchased books from B&M stores.<p>For those who self-publish, they still do their own marketing. E-published people invest the least cost (i.e., no printing), and perhaps equal time on marketing/promotion. Paper-published people invest more up front because of printing, but perhaps reach a wider audience if they can get their books into B&M stores and because like it or not, many people still prefer paper.<p>This is admittedly unscientific; my sample size is about 20, though some of them blog about their experiences, and refer to their own circles of authors and their experiences, as well.<p>As for your proposed book topic, sounds like a wonderful idea to me.",1373169016

Lists are for collections whose length doesn&#x27;t correspond to anything in particular and which you could imagine growing and shrinking.<p>As an aside, django makes this mistake and confuses people: using tuples where semantically they should be lists, presumably out of a desire for immutability.",1373169004
6000971,comment,6000229,6000513,3,0,mhd,,,"Hmm, I got 24h shipping in basically every German bookstore way before amazon arrived on the market (to the store, of course, not to my home address). Did that change in the last few years?<p>I think one of the big factors of amazon right from the start in Germany (and probably Austria and France, too, both of which have similar price laws) was that you could get the books to your own address, and that pretty quickly. That combined with the browsing experience (part of which was the novelty) got them established, and later on the expanded product range and the recommendation engine cemented their foothold. So I would say it&#x27;s not all just about the price, although I&#x27;d be very interested to hear about pricing arrangements with the publishers, especially in the early years where they didn&#x27;t exactly dominate the market.<p>To me, the biggest boon of amazon was getting English books easily and without a big markup (straight USD/EUR  rates, not some fairy tale wiggle factor). Programming books were quite a bit cheaper (German books were almost always hardocover only, and with a fixed price, of course), never mind novels (ages to translate and almost every trilogy becomes a hexalogy in German).",1373168987

Search for papers on program comprehension.<p>To address (some of) your specific point, I suspect part of the appeal of functional programming languages is that they naturally promote describing the data flow of the code. In contrast, imperative languages inherently dwell on control flow, even though its often an unimportant implementation detail. It turns out that even when were reading imperative code, were trying to figure out the underlying data flow anyway, so why not cut out the middle step?<p>I also suspect part of what holds back functional programming languages from wider acceptance is that when youre modelling something where time/order matters, the control flow is <i>not</i> an unimportant implementation detail. You have to work harder to describe it in a functional language where you get a lot for free with an imperative programming language.",1373168859

They also were only allowed to tap phones they thought might be relevant to that particular investigation.

SRFIs (which specify additional functionality like binary io and more complex list functions etc.) are more pick and choose, but the ones that are implemented are pretty standardized. (srfi 1 for lists, srfi 13 for strings, etc.)<p>I think there was a bit of disagreement over R6RS in that many implementors felt it was too bulky and un Scheme, which is why there is a R7RS small and a R7RS large. Because of that some implementations decided to stay on R5RS and extend it with sometimes de facto standards.<p>I think most people will write for only one scheme implementation if it is for a project and not a library, though. Racket for example seems like a sort of extended scheme, though they still participate in the standards process.

There are two problems. The first is the one he points out: when everything is classified and anyone who notifies the public is subject to the treatment given to Manning and Snowden, even finding out about the abuses much less holding those responsible accountable is extraordinarily difficult. The second problem is that the <i>really bad</i> abuses of an accumulation of power like this are so bad that we can&#x27;t just wait until they happen before we do anything about it.<p>He also says some questionable stuff. Like this:<p>>We asked for this. We did so because we measured the reach and possible overreach of law enforcement against the risks of terrorism and made a conscious choice.<p>Everyone in Congress who read the Patriot Act before voting on it voted against it. So no, we didn&#x27;t. We had a gut reaction to a tragedy, somebody pulled a defense contractor wish list out of a drawer and they passed it in a moment of sorrow and anger. The country is only now starting to reach the point that we can have a rational conversation about anti-terrorism without the pain of a recent tragedy allowing self-interested warmongers to goad us into an overreaction, and it&#x27;s time that we seriously reevaluate what we allow the government to do on our behalf.<p>And I&#x27;m reminded of what John Oliver said hosting the Daily Show when all of this came out: &quot;I think you&#x27;re misunderstanding the perceived problem here, Mr. President.

6000881,comment,5999179,6000718,2,0,bobwaycott,,,"I find that to be excessively creative given the facts. Had the buildup to civil war occurred in only the decade prior, or if the North postured aggressively and directly threatened the South, or if there was a significant body of historical evidence suggesting this case, it would be worth looking into. As it stands, however, we possess an incredible amount of primary sources which conclusively prove slavery had already been a source of political and ideological conflict among the states for a century. There was legitimate concern shared among the states about just what would happen economically in the South were slavery ousted, because Southern productivity was dependent upon the use of free, forced labor, while the Northern states were urbanizing, industrializing, and mechanizing their means of production.<p>The largest counterpoint to this suggestion is in the primary sources themselves. If the claim were true, we should see it throughout the secessionist documents we have available. And we do not. Slavery is the primary issue prevalent in all secessionist sources that convinced the states to withdraw from the union. There was mention of worry about the Republican call for tariffs in the 1860 election, but this did not spread across the whole of the South, nor was it a rallying cry among the secessionists as they whipped up public opinion in support and defense of first the secession, and then the Confederacy itself.<p>Ultimately, the sources speak for themselves. Take a look at the literature of the time, the pamphlets, the various arguments made for the purposes behind and need for secession and war. Wherever the states seceded, and even within those states wherever pro-Union--by which I do not and the people of the time did not mean the North, but the constitutionally declared <i>perpetual union</i> of the States--had an almost singularly consistent theme: <i>slavery</i>. There were parties and factions, candidates and referendums, that self-identified as slaveowners vs non-slaveowners. There were no demonstrable parties or groups or calls for rallying against the North and dividing the Union to repel Northern economic subjugation.<p>[EDIT]\nI worry that I may have failed at directly answering the question by my chosen vector of interrogating <i>secessionist</i> documents, as opposed to those of the Union instead. On that front, to my knowledge, there is ample evidence to suggest that some in the North preferred to allow secession to stand than fight a war to preserve the Union. Some of this has often read to me as the kind of if-you-don&#x27;t-like-it-then-good-riddance kind of attitude that occurs in these kinds of situations. I don&#x27;t at the moment have much at my fingertips to state emphatically whether there is significant evidence to support the idea that the North used slavery as a cover to subjugate the South economically. Popularly speaking, this would be difficult to prove. We would need some very strong and persuasive documents from monied interests in the North with significant political power and/or connections, a direct line to the Congress and President, and demonstrated influence on Lincoln&#x27;s decision to reject secession.<p>In the end, while secessionist and Northern declarations may have included a varying number of otherwise important reasons for the conflict, there was only one issue that so polarized the nation that one side was willing to break away from the Union and the other was willing to dispute the legitimacy of such an act.<p>---<p>Interestingly enough, this economic argument actually began immediately after war broke out (which, curiously for those who wish to dub the war one of Northern aggression, was initiated by the Southern states). More curious, however, is that this argument did not have primacy in America. Instead, it was found in the pages of the <i>London</i> press, arguing from afar that the war was one of tariffs and economic issues perpetrated against the &quot;free trade economy&quot; of the South by the North, had no basis in any principles beyond that of the North&#x27;s lust for sovereignty, and advocating that the North ought to recognize the seceded states. And then, though certainly <i>never</i> taught to <i>any</i> American student who studies the Civil War, a (now) infamous man who was ever watchful of economic matters, particularly of matters that focused on the abuses of economic power for another group&#x27;s gain, came out to dismantle these arguments in their entirety. His name? Karl Marx.<p>Marx wrote a series of articles in 1861-62 attacking the London press and politicians for fabricating reasons to explain the war that were opposed to the facts of what was actually happening in the states. In one article, he even runs down a list of seceded states and data that was available at the time showing that border states, like Tennessee, rejected secession, but were then subjugated by force of arms from the Confederacy, who laid claim to such territory as being rightfully &quot;theirs&quot; and places where the institution of slavery ought to exist.<p>* If you&#x27;re interested in more of Marx&#x27;s articles against the London press, these two are the earliest:<p><a href=""http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1861/10/25.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1861/10/25.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1861/11/07.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1861/11/07.htm</a><p>A complete listing of his Civil War articles can be found at <a href=""http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1861/us-civil-war/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1861/us-civil-war...</a>",1373166307

Lots of Python programs out there have broken i18n for no good reason because of that (nobody starts teaching python by telling you to use .decode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;)/.encode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;) when you pipe data, and by the time you realize what&#x27;s wrong, you often already have code out there.)",1373166215

6000875,comment,5995495,5998737,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"What I&#x27;m saying is that your analogy is off. The fact that the FISC only hears from one side is distinguishable from other courts because it&#x27;s all kept secret. If a district court judge issues a bad warrant, that fact eventually comes out when marshals show up at the defendant&#x27;s property to execute it or the evidence gained through it is presented in court. Then the defendant can challenge it in a public proceeding or, in sufficiently outrageous cases, the public can demand changes to the law or impeachment of the issuing judge.<p>There is none of that with the FISC. If the court makes a bad ruling, nobody is ever officially supposed to know, the government just starts hoovering up the data of American citizens under cover of darkness and anybody who brings this to the attention of the voting public will be accused of treason and then have their passport revoked and be stranded in a Russian airport.",1373166085

If this effect holds for books then they no longer have the be the cheapest to drive decent volume.",1373166018

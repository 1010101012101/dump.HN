Once the software can know how long things will take, suddenly it can do things that in x86 land would be magical.<p>This seems to me philosophically what Sony was trying to do with the Cell processor.  Expose the hardware to programmers so that they can manage things better.  The big difference being that the Mill was designed by a compiler writer rather than a bunch of guys who design GPU pipelines.",1391813960

What would the path be to using existing code/where would Mill appear logically first?<p>Also, could something like Mill work well within the HSA/Fusion/hybrid GPGPU paradigm? E.g. from my very amateur reading of your documents, it looks like a much needed and very substantial improvement to single threaded code; how would a mixed case where we have heavy matrix multiplication in some parts of our code as part of a pipeline with sequential dependencies work? Would an ideal case be a cluster (or some fast interconnect fabric in a multi socket system) of multi core Mill chips be the future?<p>Realistically, is this something that LLVM could relatively easily target? A simple add in card that could give something like Julia an order of magnitude improvement would be a very interesting proposition, especially in the HPC market. I come at this mainly from an interest how this will benefit compute intense machine learning/AI applications.<p>Sorry for all the questions.",1391813901

7199343,comment,7197255,7197534,1,0,mercurial,,,"> I am compelled to febreeze every bit of code smell I come across. I often rewrite large sections of working code into better structures, more readable/concise syntax, better naming of variables/functions, etc. and In the process I have at times introduced bugs.<p>I can absolutely relate to that. It has happened that I find code so terribly written that needed to be modified. As nobody on the team actually understood how it was supposed to be working, I ripped it out, and rewrote it in a cleaner way. I knew this may introduce regressions, but I knew the modification I had to make would very likely do the same thing. But if there were going to be bugs, I&#x27;d rather have them come from a maintainable codebase.<p>>  You know it&#x27;s dirty back there, but it&#x27;s not stopping the fridge from keeping your food cold.<p>Unfortunately, the more technical debt you accumulate, the more difficult it is to change anything.

I&#x27;ve got all the skills of all genders because I believe all skills are, unto themselves, genderless. Mannerisms, fashion, hair-styles, etc. can follow as well but really, they don&#x27;t bug me. I&#x27;ve got other interests in mind.

Other recent studies have questioned the culture-fairness of IQ tests when used in South Africa.[124][125] Standard intelligence tests, such as the Stanford-Binet, are often inappropriate for children with autism; the alternative of using developmental or adaptive skills measures are relatively poor measures of intelligence in autistic children, and may have resulted in incorrect claims that a majority of children with autism are mentally retarded.&quot;<p>Just one sample from a large literature on this topic.<p>> your language is alarmingly exaggerated and pompous for someone who lacks basic reading comprehension skills and is entirely ignorant about the subject of intelligence testing.<p>Nice argument.

This is particularly true for heavy-load transportation like 18-wheelers and industrial applications.

Turns out it only has 2x16 gigs of storage and 1 physical core.<p>Looking at the c3.8xlarge instances, they&#x27;re specced pretty much exactly like the servers I just built for $9k/each, except they have half the ram (60 vs. 128) and half the storage (2x320 vs 4x320). And they cost the same to rent for 6 months as it does to buy one, including coloing.<p>So, if you need more than a fraction of a physical server, EC2 still loses pretty hard on the pricing. It seems as though it has become competitive with Softlayer, though, at least.<p>EDIT: Ah, but if you pay $11.6k upfront to reserve it for three years, it reduces the monthly bill from $1728 to ~$370, which is a much better deal than Softlayer offers.

Network IO to PostgreSQL? Network IO to memcache?<p>Heroku is offering 2X and soon, 4X dynos; did he experiment with these?<p>The author also sounds rather excited about nginx serving static assets. The Rack::Cache problem on Heroku is easily solved with a CDN layer (and Heroku even recommends you do so.) (Cult Cosmetics /is/ set up with CloudFront, so the author obviously knows this.)<p>There are a lot of Rails architecture smells in this article, such as worrying about the 60-second boot timeout and the 30-second request timeout. [1] I have to wonder if the time invested in learning Chef and managing the architecture may have been spent making the app more performant.<p>Developer time is really, really expensive. Not only can you bill $100-$150 hour instead of learning how to use Chef, you could be shipping features for your own products, which can bring you passive income forever. A lot of companies are successfully running on Heroku, and it seems strange to throw everything out for the explained reasons.<p>[1] Specifically, adding &#x27;require: false&#x27; to your Gemfile and only loading heavy libraries when you need them greatly helps with boot time. Ideally, you won&#x27;t run any image processing libraries (like RMagick) except in background jobs, and your main app should not even need these libraries available. Same goes for PDF generation, scraping technology, or any other heavy processing.<p>The 30-second timeouts either need to be handled via background jobs (the author mentioned they use sidekiq) or uploading directly to S3, side-stepping the web process entirely.",1391810840

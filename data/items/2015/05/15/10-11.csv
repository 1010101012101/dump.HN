They are generalists with good pedigrees, which makes them trustworthy in the eyes of their clients.<p>Management consultants often get called in to vet risky projects management is considering. The idea is that if a trusted outsider OKed the project, and it fails, then management at least didn&#x27;t act irresponsibly in undertaking it. There&#x27;s a surprising amount of ass-covering in this world.<p>The other scenario is when a decision needs to be made that will inevitably hurt someone in the company, so it&#x27;s hard to find an impartial insider.

The engineers said they should build it near a population center, like in the west.  It was very inefficient in the end because once the deposit ran out they had to ship the iron and people in to work there.

Your users single click could translate to multiple API calls.<p>Additionally, as others have already mentioned, a conceptual resource does not have to equal a database entry.<p>In an application (front and back end) there are probably three data models: whats in the database, the &quot;resources&quot; transferred over the API, and what the client has locally (in memory or disk or both) and these three don&#x27;t necessarily have a 1:1 mapping. For example, in an application I&#x27;m working on, the client stores a transformed denormalised version of the resources that allows easy filtering/searching/sorting in the UI, the API resources are very regular semantic &quot;things&quot; and the database stores them in a way that is easy to index and perform access control checks on.",1431686995

Why should it not be possible to do something for the real community in 15 minutes in a bus if you can do something in that 15 minutes for your virtual community? If a world as big as Eve and a company of 300 game developers of all kinds can be financed by $15/m, why could we not find a way to bring food to 3000 homeless?<p>Also there are other meaningful things one can do that a perfectly possible with these ressources. One that I spend a lot of time doing is learning another language. Clicking through a few vocabs on Memrise is certainly possible on the bus. I do that for years now. And it&#x27;s also quite possible to pay for online/skype lectures with 15 bucks a month.  What do you think about that? I think that&#x27;s also doing something for this world. Learning a new language will make you better and will bring you closer to another culture, and by that brings both cultures a tiny step closer to understanding each other better as well, because your friends will read your FB update about that awesome book or movie you enjoyed in that other language, and you will start explaining how things work in your country to friends using that other language you&#x27;ve learned.

The bonus was decent (+20% of my original grant, though they had lowballed me originally) though essentially worthless (<$10k over 4 years) at the time.  I was a junior-level individual contributor.  After a quarter of fighting, the general counsel denied me by having the board change my grant without my signed approval.  By then, it was basically too late to sue, the grant didn&#x27;t have any value anyways, and I wouldn&#x27;t have had much of a chance of vesting the grant (over 4 years) had I sued anyways (as the management had been historically liberal with firing people).  I eventually got the majority of the value of the stock awarded after bringing to light the experience of another employee who had been treated with a similar gross lack of integrity.

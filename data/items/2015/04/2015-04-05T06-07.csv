Depending on you parents salary they might not qualify for any other type of need based financial aid except student loans. Also, merit base aid is limited and can&#x27;t be extended to all students with academic standing that usually leads to them successfully completing college with high grades.<p>In the end, a large amount of students pay for college entirely with student loans and don&#x27;t realize the cost until they are in repayment. They pay the list price and more due to other costs of going to college.<p>To successfully be able to pay for college without aid and loans a student today would need to have a full time job while students in the 1950-60... could generally pay the full amount with a summer job.<p>Edit: Also, price per students vary between faculties, a engineering student might cost 50K+ while a arts student would cost half or less of that.

9323286,comment,9321410,9322998,0,0,superuser2,,,">Google being able to set the originating phone number should be the exception rather than the norm.<p>Most non-residential buildings have a PBX which is interfaced with the PSTN (actually, a telco like AT&T) via some &quot;trunking&quot; system. Trunking systems, like SIP (which runs over IP on the regular old internet) and PRI (which runs over a T1), unlike simple analog circuits, carry multiple calls for multiple numbers at the same time.<p>The telco decides internally which PBX a call will be routed to, then presents the audio stream and signaling data (caller ID, destination phone #) to the PBX, which can do pretty much whatever it wants in response.<p>In a typical business installation, some numbers might be routed directly as calls to specific people&#x27;s extensions (we call these DIDs), while others might ring several phones at once (and go to the first person to answer), a call queue, an IVR menu, a prompt to &quot;dial your party&#x27;s extension number,&quot; etc.<p>Or you could do something exotic, like Twilio.<p>The PBX is also responsible for connecting outbound calls to the outside world. It sends signaling data (CID, destination phone #) to the telco along with whatever audio it pleases, and the telco responds accordingly.<p>Hundreds of different phone numbers might route to a PBX. No one except the PBX is in a position to know which one makes sense to send as caller ID.<p>You might say we should only let PBXes send CID of numbers which are routed to them. But this breaks a use case where a business with many branch offices wants the same caller ID (in at least some cases) on outgoing calls from all its locations. To present the &quot;main&quot; number, you would now be forced to route the call over the internal network (typically a VPN, or else a leased line) to the main location&#x27;s PBX, then out its trunk. This can get really hairy as you have a lot of load on this device as well as a single point of failure for potentially hundreds of locations.<p>So to support lots of different branch offices presenting the same CID, we now have to be in the business of maintaining a list of authorized CIDs we can send on a specific trunk line. Could it be done? Absolutely, but it isn&#x27;t simple and telcos don&#x27;t seem to think it&#x27;s worth the effort/overhead. And all it takes is one telco who doesn&#x27;t implement this requirement to make it worthless. (Just run your call spoofing website off an Asterisk instance trunked to that telco).<p>It might be nice to have a WHOIS equivalent for telephony - some way to find out the legal name of the entity which pays the bill for receiving calls at a specific number - but no one has gone to the trouble of creating an exhaustive database and forcing telcos to participate in it.",1428214370

9323267,comment,9322797,9322797,0,0,graycat,,,"The OP keeps talking about the
<i>tuition increases</i>.  But as far
as I could tell, the OP was considering
only, call it, tuition <i>list prices</i>.
But, with scholarships, various forms
of <i>financial aid</i>, etc., maybe often the
<i>list price</i> is not the <i>actual price</i>,
that is, what the school
actually receives from the student
(and their family).  So, the OP didn&#x27;t
explain how much the <i>actual price</i>
has changed over the decades.<p>E.g., recently Stanford announced that
the tuition will be $0.00 
for any student whose family
earns less than $125,000 a year.
Sure, maybe the <i>list price</i> tuition
at Stanford is ballpark $50,000 a
year.  But the <i>actual price</i> is
sometimes zero.  And some scholarships
also cover room and board making
the <i>actual price</i> negative.<p>It was long the case that the tuition
for a student
paid only ballpark 1/3rd of the full
school budget per student.  So, maybe
what&#x27;s happened is that the schools
decided to set the <i>list price</i>
to be the full cost per student,
maybe plus some,
and have students from wealthy families
actually pay that price.  Then
nearly all the rest of the students
get a significantly lower <i>actual
price</i>, maybe even $0.00.<p>Further, given that there are student
loans available to cover the <i>list 
price</i>, then maybe just go ahead and
charge list price for students 
using student loans.<p>Then we have the issue of, with 
so many students getting student loans,
maybe they are not very good students
and wouldn&#x27;t even have been accepted
at the school back decades ago.  Maybe.
Or, if some money sources are eager 
to pay or loan <i>list price</i> for some not very
good students, then colleges can be
tempted to go ahead and take the 
<i>list price</i>
easy money and let the students
attend the classes.",1428213672

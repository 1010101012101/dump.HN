If it is your dream job, and the partnership materializes, go for it.<p>On the other hand, you may discover that your dream job isn't what you really thought it was. Then you can move on starting your own business with greater commitment, either full time or on the side.<p>You should also evaluate your reasons for wanting to start your own business.

There has to be a reason why it's a site for women, especially since we don't have sites for startups explicitly for men. That reason is probably because of our patriarchal society more than anything, but his implication that perhaps it indicates that the male to female founder ratio is a little lopsided is not invalid.<p>I don't think it necessarily means women are not accepted into entrepreneurial enterprises, because it could also mean that women simply are less interested.",1261783209

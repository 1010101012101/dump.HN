For software engineering, apprenticeship may be a better path (which you can start on during college via internships BTW).<p>I think a lot of people are framing this topic as ""4 years of college vs. 4 years of something else"" when the real answer is more likely to be college <i>plus</i> something else.

Or, for that matter, drunk?<p>Drivers aged 16-19 have auto fatality rates <i>four times</i> higher than other drivers. That's not because they are magnets for middle aged drunk drivers.<p>1 in 4 teens killed in auto accidents were under the influence of alcohol.<p>Children are more likely to be molested by family members and friends of the family than by strangers. They are also more likely to die by stepping into the car of a friend than by being hit while driving alone. It's important to instill in your children the skills necessary to deal with the actual threats they are likely to encounter.

Of course, you have to cost-benefit that against certain lifestyle choices, but there are actual tradeoffs that would be affected by this. For instance, the actual risk of a child getting abducted on public transit is probably a lot less than the risk of the child getting killed in a car accident, but most parents ignore the car accident risk and drive their kids around instead of letting them take the bus[1]/train/subway/monorail.<p>[1] Trains in particular, but even buses are likely safer--they're driven by professionals who tend to drive more slowly and conservatively. They also have a higher profile so other vehicles are more likely to see them, and on many buses, passengers are elevated above bumper height. It seems like an ordeal to get the statistics on buses together, though, so if it makes it more convenient for you to understand my point, you can just pretend I didn't mention anything about buses.",1284144803

It predates most of what we now think of as C++. It managed to bring Smalltalk-style dynamic messaging to C in a manner that wasn't insanely slow and didn't depend on heavy-weight virtual machines.<p>Are Python's dictionaries syntactically a bit cleaner? Sure. But Python is much newer and had the advantage of not having to maintain compatibility with a vast corpus of C code, and not having to care about achieving very very very good native code run-time performance on very resource limited machines.<p>It's just a tool.

This is ""mountain climber"" syndrome, which says that after you spend all that time and pain climbing the mountain, it's going to be the best experience ever.<p>Second, if the cost of college is rising faster than the cost of inflation, the question isn't <i>is college worth it</i>, the question is <i>is college worth it so far</i>. Because at some point it's not going to be worth it. The only question is when.<p>I'm a huge fan of education. Personally I wish that everybody had the equivalent of a 4-year degree in liberal arts before even starting on the rest of their education careers. But I think it's painfully obvious that the idea of college as being a simple ticket out of anywhere has gotten a lot more complex than it used to be. Lots of factors to weigh. Hard-working people who self-educate do well with or without college. Other folks may be thinking that college is giving them something that it isn't.<p>Not only is the cost an issue, but technology is moving so quickly that having a little stamp of approval isn't going to hold weight like it did even back forty years ago. If you're in the technology field and your degree is more than ten years old? You've got an ancient history degree, sadly.",1284143983

There is no formal non-compete obligation here (as this would be unenforceable under California law). Of course, part of the settlement is that Mr. Hurd honor its confidentiality terms by which he cannot disclose or misuse HP's trade secrets. That commitment, however, is governed by the California law that protects the employer from threatened breaches of that obligation upon a proper showing of evidence but that does not enable a court to block the employee from taking a position with a competing company simply based on the notion that he would inevitably disclose such trade secret information by virtue of the position he holds with the competitor.<p>The California law applies whether or not the employee has the ability to ride out a non-compete period in terms of earning a living. It is codified in the state's statutes and judges cannot make an exception based on the fact that a particular employee got well-paid on his departure (especially since the payment was not in fact given in exchange for a non-compete but for other reasons).",1284143969

I've had customers who came in WAY under deadline (which is a problem, because it means I have empty calendar days and am not getting paid), and I've had customers in came in WAY over deadline (which is a problem, because it means I'm pushing back other obligations or start dates.)  I tend to average somewhere around 'on time', but there's no magic bullet for it, and even if there was, the customer would likely either eat/break/object to your use of a magic bullet, or expect receive ownership of said bullet at the project's completion.<p>In the mechanical industry, this is mitigated by extensive knowledge of how long things take, and on averaging.  If I call the local Jeep dealership, and ask how much it will cost to replace my transmission, they have a database they look in, which is effectively an average of how long transmission replacements have taken over the history of however long they've been replacing transmissions. They know the material cost, and they have a good average on the labor time (and of course they know the labor rate).  They have <i>experience</i> in estimating that sort of work -- without it, their system would be largely useless.<p>Aside from that, until you get that experience, the best advice is the oft-submitted (multiply by 'x'), and make x as generous as you think you can get away with until you get some more estimating experience under your belt.",1284142765

The people I know with art and art-history degrees seem to have no problem finding work with design and advertising firms, among other things.<p>Now, they aren't all doing their first choice or what their degree exactly is about, but that's also true of many technical people. Probably the <i>worst</i> group for that is people with only a B.S. in a basic science--- nobody I know with just a B.S. in physics, bio, or chemistry has been able to get a job they're particularly happy with in science.

They also have inconsistent rules about anonymity. \nYou required to register with your real name. You have a choice of answering with you real name or as anon, but you must comment with your real name. You also can't see the name of the person, asking the question, who apparently can add anon comments ...<p>I can't delete my comments, my questions, my answers and my account at all, since they locked my account, after I added comments about some inappropriate and offensive questions.<p>You say Facebook has privacy issues?

However, to be honest, most of the <i>knowledge</i> that I value has come outside of traditional education. Much of my most useful knowledge in physics, biology, astronomy, language, etc. has come from self-study, from reading old issues of National Geographic, Popular Science, Scientific American during high school and after, from reading text books and non-fiction books on my own. The most important contribution to my intellectual character has probably come from Carl Sagan's Cosmos, above any course or line of study in formal education.<p>That being said, there have been some substantial and crucial bits of knowledge I likely would not have acquired outside of school. Calculus and advanced mathematics, most especially the rigor of formal proofs that has proven immensely useful and practical to me and yet came of a degree course I chose essential by accident. And the experience of chemistry laboratory courses, using equipment that I would not have had access to outside of college, is something I would be sorry to have missed.<p>Overall, I'd say that college can still be a valuable experience but the increasing reliance on college as the sole route to education is troublesome and problematic.",1284141734

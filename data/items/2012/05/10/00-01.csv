3951300,comment,3948051,3948942,4,0,davegauer,,,"CSS was clearly designed with typography and text layout in mind - and it works wonderfully for that purpose.  But it was not created flexibly enough to be well suited for anything else.   You CAN make graphical interfaces with it (and we do, because we have to).  But it's all hacks.<p>I think the browser inconsistencies are as frustrating as they are because doing seemingly ""simple"" things in CSS requires using advanced CSS features in boundary-pushing ways (this wonderful arrow box app is a perfect example).  Browser support has to be EXCELLENT before certain simple layout things are even possible.  Imagine a CSS that supported things like ""vertical-align: center"".  That's a CSS that wouldn't NEED to have its boundaries pushed to the limits and the rough edges of browsers wouldn't rankle nearly so much.<p>It never ceases to amaze me how quickly people jump to defend CSS as if any criticisms imply that the author thinks we'd be better off back in the days of deeply nested tables.

Many journals started out as independent or university-affiliated publications which charged to cover costs; then were gradually spun off or bought out by for-profit institutions through the 60s and 70s. The accretion of publishers into a small number of companies, each with a virtual monopoly on critical journals in the field, resulted in the insane balance of power we currently experience. Inelastic demand for information (it's <i>extremely</i> difficult to do research without access to the major journals in your field) means Elsevier et al can jack up prices almost arbitrarily.",1336610221

Part of my duty description was inputting MAC addresses of ""authorized computers"" into an extremely dodgy database system which allowed them to pick up an IP address via DHCP.<p>When I first started in the position and had this explained to me I pointed out that anyone could just plug a machine into the network and use trial and error to find an IP address to manually enter and get them onto the network. IE: the process wasn't securing anything.<p>My point was pushed aside because ""this is just the way we do things"".<p>The 1st time I had to input 20+ new PCs into the system I whipped up an autoit script (I had to insert via a terrible GUI interface as the DBAs wouldn't grant me direct access to the database) which grabbed the data required from the xls the supplier gave us and automagically inserted the info. My scripting didn't get noticed until one day when I input 200 machines in the space of an hour, the task had taken the previous person in the role a whole day or more.<p>I was rewarded with a higher workload and grudges from all my co-workers, who had all previously done the task before moving up the totem pole and dumping this ridiculous job onto the next new sucker.<p>The highlight was when I gave notice and during my exit planning meeting my supervisor said that one of the old staff would train my replacement on how to do this task, rather than me show someone the system I hacked up which was an order of magnitude more efficient.",1336610023

Already now even with the strong demand for Android developers the demand for Java programmers is shrinking since at least 12 months.<p>Luckily sharpen (Java -> C#) is making great progress these days and MS is step-by-step understanding the benefits of open source for platform / infrastructure providers.<p>At the same time how about giving Oracle their way with this process and at the same time provide all universities / colleges / training centers and all those having been trained there the right to reclaim the cost for training in Java and retrain them in another (but still free) language, pay them salaries and educate them for years until they got to the same experience level they might have with Java now. 10 million Java users is a lot and 1995-2012 is a long time.<p>And lets do these reclaims ""Hollywood style"" just the way ORCL likes to do it themselves - how about $50 Billion, $100 Billion or even better 10 Million times what they claim from Google Oracle should pay back to all those who invested into the Java language after having been deceived by statements from Sun & Oracle that Java is a free language they can use to build businesses on.",1336610020

DOCSIS is sort of like a mobile network in a pipe. The base station in this case is called a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) and data is transmitted from there over RF with QAM modulation to all the cable modems on the same coaxial segment. This can be hundreds or even thousands of cable modems. For unicast IP the packet is only received by one of them but they all have to listen.<p>When the radio spectrum inside the coaxial cable becomes congested the segment has to be split in two parts and a new CMTS installed, very similar to how you split a mobile network cell into sectors to improve capacity. Like with a mobile network this is capital intensive.<p>Not saying this makes Comcast right. But important to understand where they're coming from.",1336609816

For example, if we said the magnets attract like rubber bands, I would be cheating you. Because they're not connected by rubber bands. I'd soon be in trouble. And secondly, if you were curious enough, you'd ask me why rubber bands tend to pull back together again, and I would end up explaining that in terms of electrical forces, which are the very things that I'm trying to use the rubber bands to explain. So I have cheated very badly, you see. So I am not going to be able to give you an answer to why magnets attract each other except to tell you that they do.""",1336608983

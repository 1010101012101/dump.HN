In this particular study, the results may not be conclusive enough to act on; that aside, there ARE other health studies that have been successfully repeated (for example, the negative effects of hydrogenated oils/trans fats) that are also frequently dismissed by a media-weary public as yet another ""health scare meme"".<p>The ""trans fats are bad"" idea is finally going mainstream, but IMO it took years longer than it should have because of the media's tendency to jump at the first study showing a surprising result, and thus inuring the public to ""bad health news,"" which a majority of people then proceed to ignore (and a minority jump onto the latest bandwagon).<p>In the case of standing vs. sitting, I saw this study months ago, and at the same time I started feeling uncomfortable sitting for long periods, and the combination caused me to build a standing desk.

If you can find someone like this and partner with them, you can continue to focus on coding while this person helps you market the software.  This doesn't have to be expensive - if you can find someone who truly believes in your product and would appreciate a percentage of future sales - it would be a win/win.<p>2) If you can't find an evangelist, is there a way for you to build a community around your product?  A support forum, ugen content, Q&A site, something that engages people can be an excellent way to either find an evangelist or empower a group of people to become evangelists for you.<p>3) If you're just looking for straight up ways to motivate yourself to stay in marketing mode, consider using Jerry Seinfeld's method of productivity.

What is it about coding that makes you prefer doing it?  And then, how can you mimic those conditions for all the ""other stuff""?<p>In order to motivate myself to do the marketing type work, I had to connect a better feedback loop between that type of work, and my ultimate yardstick of success: revenue.<p>I did the same type of marketing you did for a while, and it was frustrating.  You don't really know how/if/when your efforts are paying off.  It feels like you're just grinding without any evident payoff.<p>So I pivoted a bit on my marketing project.  I (we) completely changed our business model so that we see a clear progression from our marketing efforts to revenue. Basically, we started looking at page views instead of signing revenue sharing contracts, after a bit of a product pivot.  This gave us lots of smaller feedback -- when you go a few weeks between checks coming in, things get tense... but when you're focused on page views, you have more frequent incremental improvement).  We started looking at our logs more closely, and identified which sites had the better payoff for the least work.<p>In short, we did a few things differently, but it was just as important that we reframe the metric of success in our minds.  Having that positive feedback loop is extremely important to morale.

I can remember the end of the process it took both my parents to get green cards very many years ago when I was a kid. It was with a lawyer that dealt with the case like it was cakewalk where everyone else wouldn't even touch the case for being too complicated (I suspect it was something with prior legal non-arranged marriages and a visa overstay). After the last interview my parents and their lawyer were partying like there was no tomorrow.<p>As for the marriage suggestion, this may be downvoted to hell, but if that's your only option left it isn't impossible. It's a huge commitment on the part of you and the person you marry, as well as anyone associated with you both and that's usually what makes or breaks the deal. It takes so much to prove your marriage that it's incredibly difficult to fake it with someone you don't care about or know very well (and vice versa). Sometime last year I went to an interview to be an interpreter for a family friend applying for a green card, and the people trying to use marriage to get a green card were very obvious by the huge bags full of photo albums and more they were carrying around. One person I saw brought literally thousands of printed photos to flood their interviewer with, and another couple were sorting through a huge photo library on their laptop. It's no joke. (And obligatory ""it's illegal"" comment.)<p>Of course, it isn't your only option at this point. Since you say your parents are now citizens, they have options for sponsoring you especially if you are under 21. I don't know that the visa overstay and green card problem is necessarily true since you entered the country legally and there are probably ways to work around that 10 year thing, but IANAL. Like I said, a good lawyer makes a big difference. Shop around if you must. They will be better to inform you of your choices.",1303748330

(Their product is awesome.)<p>It is also great news for SaaS startup generally, since Wufoo is a little of column A and a little of column B on the typical grow via revenues VS get investment and grow massively dichotomy.  That's a data point in the favor of at least some investors making investments in companies which have a projected trajectory where massive success results in a company on the scale of 37Signals/FogCreek/Wufoo rather than resulting in a company on the scale of Zynga/Groupon.  $35 million won't exactly have VCs salivating but, oh well, if they don't invest they don't get a vote -- the angels and employees of Wufoo have to be happy like clams at this outcome.",1303748147

2481690,comment,2475592,2476285,1,0,lambda,,,"I consider IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera all as major browsers. Sure, Opera only has 1-2% global market share; but consider the fact that 1-2% global market share means somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 million users (assuming estimates of 2 billion global internet users is correct). I consider that a fairly significant browser.<p>Also, there are markets in Europe where that percentage is much, much higher. And those European markets are generally a lot more relevant to me than China (and to an extent other Asian countries like South Korea), where a lot of the IE usage comes from. Due to the greater internationalization, cultural, and regulatory barriers in China, it's not a market that interests me all that much.<p>I generally consider the major browsers to be ones which have their own rendering engines (though Chrome and Safari share one, they both do significant development of that engine and each have their own JavaScript interpreters), actively attempt to be compatible with the entire public web, participate in the web standards process, introduce innovations to the web platform which are later adopted by other browsers, and have a significant number of worldwide users or users in major markets. IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera all meet those criteria.",1303747524

Good luck to B&N on trying to compete with the rest of the market. They'll probably be buying whatever is cheap and just re-branding it, as I'm sure they're doing now. This will mean it's not a quality product.<p>2. People will continue to buy iPad no matter where the market goes. It will continue to be the trend-setter when it comes out soon with a hidef screen, 3d and battery life to match. The fact that B&N doesn't do any Hardware or Software work will mean their quality and finish will suffer. I imagine they're selling it at cost or slightly above to stay competitive with the Kindle.<p>My guess, in the long run, people will have a new Android pad and then another.  Kindle users will still be using their device for reading and buying books because that's all it does. But when color e-Paper come out, Amazon will be the only manufacturer with a mature OS that is practical for the slow refresh rate of e-Paper. The battery life and display quality over typical LCDs will make it appeal to a niche that no other device has.",1303747491

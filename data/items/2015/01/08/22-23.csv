To be honest, that is what surprised me the most in this article: that someone who runs a statistical arbitrage desk has the time for all of this.<p>I wonder if companies could collaborate to create this hiring process. It would save hiring manager&#x27;s time, applicants&#x27; time since one application will count for different jobs, and then a system could be set for candidates to rank their employees, then the candidate who performs the best get his first wish, the second candidate gets is first wish if there is still room, otherwise he gets his second wish, and so on - a similar system is being used in France for students to chose in which universities they want to go after competitive exam entrance, basically lots of universities pool exams together.<p>On one hand it would scale hiring process, on the other hand it&#x27;s not flexible and offers have to be transparent (it&#x27;s currently not the case but maybe that would be a good thing), and it would hurt the pride of companies who are ranked in the last position.<p>In the case of the article, I am sure someone who is able to solve in a language he recently learn the non trivial software that are mentioned will be able to land a job at some point.

For instance to compile rustc you download a &quot;stage 0&quot; compiler at Vx which compiles a &quot;stage 1&quot; compiler using Vy > Vx source. That stage 1 compiler is then used to compile the stage 2 compiler from the same source. Stage 1 and stage 2 may not be identical since stage 0 and stage 1 may have different optimisations &al, so the stage 2 compiler is used to compile rust a third time, and that compilation is checked against the original stage 2 (and should be a fixpoint).",1420757250

8859322,comment,8857113,8858776,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I shouldn’t post this.<p>It’s hard for me to single out specific patterns because it feels like the things I’m doing today (taking an idea from a written description, PowerPoint presentation or flowchart and converting it to run in an operating system with a C-based language) are the same things I was doing 25 years ago.  It might be easier to identify changes.<p>If there’s one change that stands out, it’s that we’ve gone from imperative programming to somewhat declarative programming.  However, where imperative languages like C, Java, Perl, Python etc (for all their warts) were written by a handful of experts, today we have standards designed by committee.  So for example, compiling a shell script in C++ that spins up something like Qt to display “Hello, world!” is orders of magnitude more complicated than typing an index.html and opening it in a browser, and that’s fantastic.  But what I didn’t see coming is that the standards have gotten so convoluted that a typical HTML5/CSS/Javascript/PHP/MySQL website is so difficult to get right across browsers that it’s an open problem.  Building a browser that can reliably display those standards responsively is nontrivial to say the least.<p>That affects everyone, because when the standards are perceived as being so poor, they are ignored.  So now we have the iOS/Android mobile bubble employing millions of software engineers, when really these devices should have just been browsers on the existing internet.  There was no need to resurrect Objective-C and Java and write native apps.  That’s a pretty strong statement I realize, but I started programming when an 8 MHz 68000 was considered a fast CPU, and even then, graphics processing totally dominated usage (like 95% of a game’s slowness was caused by rasterization).  So today when most of that has been offloaded to the GPU, it just doesn’t make sense to still be using low level languages.  Even if we used Python for everything, it would still be a couple of orders of magnitude faster than the speed we accepted in the 80s.  But everything is still slow, slower in fact than what I grew up with, because of internet lag and megabytes of bloatware.<p>I started writing a big rant about it being unconscionable that nearly everyone is not only technologically illiterate, but that their devices are unprogrammable.  But then I realized that that’s not quite accurate, because apps do a lot of computation for people without having to be programmed, which is great.  I think what makes me uncomfortable about the app ecosystem is that it’s all cookie cutter.  People are disenfranchised from their own computing because they don’t know that they could have the full control of it that we take for granted.  They are happy with paying a dollar for a reminder app but don’t realize that a properly programmed cluster of their device and all the devices around them could form a distributed agent that could make writing a reminder superfluous.  I think in terms of teraflops and petaflops but the mainstream is happy with megaflops (not even gigaflops!)<p>It’s not that I don’t think regular busy people can reason about this stuff.  It’s more that there are systemic barriers in place preventing them from doing so.  A simple example is that I grew up with a program called MacroMaker.  It let me record my actions and play them back to control apps.  So I was introduced to programming before I even knew what it was.  Where is that today, and why isn’t that one of the first things they show people when they buy a computer?  Boggles my mind.<p>Something similar to that, that would allow the mainstream to communicate with developers is Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).  The gist of it is that the client writes the business logic rather than the developer, in a human-readable way.  It turns out that their business logic description takes the same form as the unit tests we’ve been writing all these years, we just didn’t know it.  It turns out to be fairly easy to build a static mockup with BDD/TDD using hardcoded values and then fill in the back end with a programming language to make an app that can run dynamically.  Here is an example for Ruby called Cucumber:<p><a href=""http://cukes.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cukes.info</a><p>More info:<p><a href=""http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT8QDNNhExg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT8QDNNhExg</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development</a><p>How this relates back to my parent post is that a supercomputer today can almost fill in the back end if you provide it with the declarative BDD-oriented business logic written in Gherkin.  That means that a distributed or cloud app written in something like Go would give the average person enough computing power that they could be writing their apps in business logic, making many of our jobs obsolete (or at the very least letting us move on to real problems).  But where’s the money in that?",1420754605

This fund would be held in other currencies and could be drawn down as necessary to keep the local currency stable in the absence of exports.<p>True, much of the domestic economy would be providing care to older people (and few tangible exports) but distributions from the sovereign wealth fund  would ensure the Japanese still have a high standard of living.<p>Pay-as-you-go social security systems are the real problem, not low birth rates.",1420754463

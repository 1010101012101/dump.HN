Basic web technologies - client-side HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and I mean writing them directly, not via absurdly wasteful layers of JS frameworks) - are a great tools for adding UIs to connected devices. You don&#x27;t need <i>that</i> much resources for a HTTP server if you already have TCP/IP connectivity, and you also don&#x27;t need much resources to output some rudimentary HTML or to process POST requests.<p>It&#x27;s also a pretty cool tool for adding UIs to software you code locally. Embedding a HTTP server is simple in most languages, and for some cases, a web interface will be much simpler than building an equivalent from &quot;native&quot; UI components.<p>--<p>Incidentally, one of the best demonstrations I saw of that was in the book Land of Lisp. The book teaches you Common Lisp by guiding you through writing a few games.

In the case of &quot;patio11&quot; vs &quot;patio11 llc&quot; maybe his point seems like a polite fiction (though that discounts the value of removing taxing agencies from the transactions and thus generating more cash for the OSS project), but in the case of bigger companies what he&#x27;s getting at is very important.<p>I work for a medium sized company with sub 1k employees across many countries and jurisdictions.  Knowing when/how/where our company can legally donate to anything is a problem at the intersection of legal, accounting and marketing, groups I have very little influence with and even less interest in embedding myself in.  In fact, I assume there is some committee at our company for charitable works, but I don&#x27;t know anything about who is on it, how to contact it etc.  Even if I did, the idea of a) explaining what OSS is and b) trying to argue for using our charitable contributions budget on OSS software vs cancer research, low income literacy, or whatever else we currently support seems down right icky.<p>Because you see, OSS isn&#x27;t a charity for us.  We use OSS to solve business problems.  It provides real business value that I (and my colleagues) are very cognizant of and would be happy to pay for.   If an OSS project had an invoice and a credit card form my process for getting them cash looks like this &quot;ME:Hey $manager_type_with_payment_card give me the card, I need to spend $some_value_less_than_payment_card_transaction_max on  some software we use all the time. THEM:Why? ME:My time explaining it will cost the company more than $some_value_less_than_payment_card_transaction_max.&quot; THEM: Cool, here you go.&quot;  Contrast that with the above nightmare of meetings and committees and you can understand why I don&#x27;t even try to get my company to &quot;donate&quot; to OSS.<p>There is a lesson for SaaS business in there as well.  A recurring charge is much like a donation in that it requires me to navigate a lot of hurdles.  A one time fee for a time limited license on the other hand falls into the payment card conversation above.  So you are <i>much</i> more likely to get me to pay you $500 for 1 year of access to your software and no recurring contract, than you are to get me to pay $5 a month recurring.",1452260318

Wikipedia, EFF, and of course some non-tech-related charities.<p>Every year, I weigh whether I should throw some bucks to the Mozilla Foundation.  I&#x27;ve been using their browsers, under one name or another, for over 20 years since the day I first discovered the web.  It&#x27;s been the most important piece of software in my life.<p>I appreciate what they (along with Apache and BSD) have done in providing an open source counterexample for the GPL, and opening the door for open source in corporate software development.<p>Moreover, I worry about their long-term financial viability.  Yahoo is NOT going to be around in its current form forever.  I&#x27;m not sure whether there&#x27;s any other &quot;anchor sponsor&quot; on the horizon that would fund Mozilla at the same level as Google or Yahoo without forcing compromises in principles.<p>However, I still just haven&#x27;t been able to make myself click the donate button.<p>The things that I ACTUALLY care about from Mozilla (i.e. Firefox and Thunderbird) are things that fell into their lap from Netscape back in 1998, and which they&#x27;ve incrementally tweaked or re-worked in the two decades since.  I don&#x27;t feel a sense that anyone in a leadership position at Mozilla really cares about those things.  I think they see them as &quot;legacy software&quot;, providing only a &quot;brand&quot; to be &quot;leveraged&quot; in squeezing a bunch of other junk onto their resumes.<p>They work on a lot of interesting technical things behind the scenes, but little of it appears to have traction or visibility.  The things that ARE promoted by leadership and marketing are &quot;day-late-and-dollar-short&quot; imitations of whatever Google did a few years prior.  I don&#x27;t care if you create a &quot;me too&quot; copy of Android without any phone carriers to sell it.  I don&#x27;t care if you create a &quot;me too&quot; Raspberry Pi, that will be lost in a sea of other coming-soon hobby boards by the time it&#x27;s actually released.<p>The Wikipedia article on Mozilla suggests that their annual budget has grown from $2 million initially, to over $300 million today.  You know what?  They were a better <i>and more RELEVANT</i> organization when they were closer to the $2 million mark.  I don&#x27;t want to donate money so that a band of Google-reject executives can pad their resumes with nonsense and shut down Thunderbird.<p>I almost kinda HOPE that their funding collapses in the wake of Yahoo&#x27;s death, so that the leadership bails and they&#x27;re forced to downsize into something sensible and focused on the flagships.  I just hope that the perhaps-inevitable reformation can happen gracefully without being so jarring as to end Mozilla altogether.",1452259853

On some machines changing these statements blindly will cause a different bit pattern to end up in memory (because there are no requirements on the machine&#x27;s representations for e.g. integers or NULL or ..).

His suggestion uses automatic storage (and subsequently a stack overflow triggered by user input -- aka. a security bug)<p>- &quot;There is no performance penalty for getting zero&#x27;d memory&quot; this is bullshit. calloc() might optimize for the case where it is allocating from a page the OS has just supplied but I doubt any implementation ever bothered to do this, since it relies on the host OS to always zero new pages<p>- &quot;If a function accepts arbitrary input data and a length to process, don&#x27;t restrict the type of the parameter.&quot; the former version is in every way more self-documenting and consistent with the apparent function of the procedure than his use of void<i>.

Just wipes it out by way of a clever compiler. Only now we substitute this same learning curve &quot;debugging&quot; the compiler rather than debugging memory space. <i>(Probably a better trade-off in the long run. Rust sort of bets on that being true anyway.)</i><p>Go does not suffer from either of these traits. For me, Go is not often a &quot;fun language&quot; to code in but it&#x27;s eminently practical and is remarkably fast to pick up for what it does express. I&#x27;ve ported a couple pieces of C# application systems to Go and they&#x27;ve worked really well. But it&#x27;s kind of a grind unwinding the higher level abstractions from C# into the more primitive Go space.<p>I wish there was some way to bury Rust&#x27;s borrow checker for those parts of an application where you don&#x27;t want to care about it and then surface it gradually when you do want it.

But I think the point is that those things manifest themselves in a healthy market/economy/society, a healthy <i>innovative</i> market. If you&#x27;re not advancing technologically, then you have no hope for your future. And that&#x27;s what companies like Samsung, Toshiba, and Sony all do (in the electronics industry). They innovate. That innovation breeds more innovation and lays the groundwork/framework for future innovation.<p>That&#x27;s China&#x27;s biggest problem right now; they relied so much on theft of IP that they lack the infrastructure to innovate on their own. They&#x27;re stuck on a ledge and can&#x27;t go any higher without either technological handouts or stealing more IPs. Unfortunately for China, companies are becoming much better at protecting themselves having learned from past mistakes.<p>China is essentially the world&#x27;s factory. That&#x27;s all, nothing more, nothing less. That&#x27;s all they will ever be until they climb down from their ledge and start climbing up again (starting over from scratch).<p>> They have 15% of the world&#x27;s population<p>And? not sure how this is relevant. If anything, it&#x27;s even more incriminating; they have that many people but so little to show for it. So little genius, so little innovation, so little advancement...

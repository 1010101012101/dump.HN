I work at apartmenttherapy.com -- which is primarily a content/advertising oriented business, though we are building toward some more app & community-oriented features in the near future.  Most of the systems I've evaluated tend to fall into either a ""bug tracker,"" ""help desk"" and/or ""CRM"" bucket, none of which is a good fit for what we need.  What we need is more of a ""reader communication"" platform.  We get a LOT of incoming email but we don't have very good tools for really tracking it.  Options I've evaluated are generally too rigid and expensive, or flexible but a lot of work to adapt & maintain , and ugly (e.g., RT).<p>Being able to manage the system solely over email, at least for basic interactions, I think is really important for my team. I really liked some of the features of Email Center Pro (<a href=""http://www.emailcenterpro.com/features/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emailcenterpro.com/features/</a>) but found their UI a bit too clunky and the inability to do basic management directly in the email client was a killer.

They are terribly slow, even web based ones, for people who have multiple accounts, have a high email volume, and have to archive all their mail and have it easily accessible. Essentially the problem is most email clients suck, many terminal apps have been optimized for speed and thus many people with a ton of email use them, the culmination of all my mailboxes is about 22Gb of email! Outlook sucks at handling mailboxes over 5Gb same with most other clients, Gmail is ok at it but searching is a bit slow, and organization and control isn't that great. Gmail is also slow in usability compared to most clients like mutt or sup.<p>Not only that but HTML emails INCREASE mailbox size dramatically! Especially HTML signatures, because they generally use several different sizes/faces of font, contain images and may introduce ""email backgrounds"".

He proposed a set of ""supply side"" tax cuts, was forced to phase them in over 3 years (remember he never had a Republican House majority and had a Senate one for only a short period as I recall) and that helped drag out the stagflation pain---e.g. people postponed taxable events until the cuts were fully in effect---but after that it was ""Morning In America"" (the theme of his 1984 election campaign).<p>That started in 1981.  In 1982 he was forced into a major FICA (Social Security and Medicare) tax increase (note that's regressive) and from that point until this year or next FICA taxes have been in surplus to needs and were spent on the general fisc (SS and Medicare have a ""lockbox"" of unmarketable bonds for the money the Federal Government owes them).<p>In 1986 it was argued that the tax system was out of wack and various changes were made and as I recall some individual rates were increased, but there was at least attempted balancing in things like deductions or exemptions (can't recall the details).<p>Starting in 1981 as I recall there was also and indexing of thresholds and so on to inflation (prior to that the Congress would regularly pass ""tax cuts"" but people's tax bills would keep going up because they got pushed by inflation into higher tax rate brackets).<p>If you want to try to make the point you're making you're going to have to use a better source of data.<p>And this is largely irrelevant as a answer to the question ""What makes sense <i>today</i>?""  Reagan cut tax rates in 1981-3 when we had been suffering from a decade or more of stagflation.  (Some) tax rates were increased in 1986 long after the economy recovered.  Clinton raised tax rates in 1993 after the recovery of the G. H. W. Bush recession and they weren't disastrous.<p>Today we are at best in a technical recovery with sustained and increasing true unemployment being a lagging indicator (if measured traditionally the unemployement rate would be around 22% according to <a href=""http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/unemployment-charts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/unemployment-chart...</a>).

It does quote the investigation report correctly, but then expands on what it allegedly means in a way that is entirely inconsistent with what the explanatory text in the report (which they don't quote) says.<p>So, after the text they quote ending ""... the figure supplied for the WMO Report was misleading"", the investigation report says:<p><i>We do not find that it is misleading to curtail reconstructions at some point per se, or to splice data, but we believe that both of these procedures should have been made plain -- ideally in the figure but certainly clearly described in either the caption or the text.</i><p>So the complaint is not that there's anything wrong with the results, but that they should have said more about the procedure by which they were obtained. The Heritage Foundation, on the other hand, says:<p><i>What they were trying to hide was the discrepancy between actual temperature readings and the temperatures suggested by tree ring data. They have relied on tree ring data to show that the earth was cooler in the past. If the tree ring data is not reliable (as the discrepancy in recent years would suggest), then maybe the earth was actually hotter in the past than these researchers would have us believe -- and perhaps the hot temperatures of recent years do not represent unprecedented global warming but just natural variation in climate.</i><p>So the Heritage Foundation's complaint is that the tree-ring reconstructions might be just plain wrong, and that the CRU's material obscures that and therefore suggests more confidence in AGW than is justified by the data. Note first of all that none of that is supported by the material from the investigation report. Secondly, it happens that the investigation report <i>does</i> comment on the issue of whether recent divergence between tree-ring data and temperature shows what the Heritage Foundation suggest it shows. Here's what the report says:<p><i>21. We do not find that the way that data derived from tree rings is described and presented in IPCC AR4 and shown in its Figure 6.10 is misleading. In particular, on the question of the composition of temperature reconstructions, we found no evidence of exclusion of other published temperature reconstructions that would show a very different picture. The general discussion of sources of uncertainty in the text is extensive, including reference to divergence. In this respect it represented a significant advance on the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR.)</i><p><i>22. On the allegation that the phenomenon of ""divergence"" may not have been properly taken into account when expressing the uncertainty associated with reconstructions, we are satisfied that it is not hidden and that the subject is openly and extensively discussed in the literature, including CRU papers.</i><p>In other words: when you look at the bit of the investigation report that's concerned with the <i>exact issue the Heritage Foundation is complaining about here</i>, it turns out that they think that complaint is invalid. But of course that doesn't fit the Heritage Foundation's agenda, so instead they quote a different portion of the report and pretend it says what they want it to say.",1278685537

1500683,comment,1500564,1500564,0,0,TylerJewell,,,"Both my girlfriend and I have been pursuing strategic defaults on our primary residences in the state of California.  Her property is underwater by 300K.  Mine is about 250K.  Neither of us are wealthy, but the financial upside of pursuing this route is very compelling.<p>In California, if the loan on the home is a purchase money loan, which is the one used to purchase the home, and not refinanced, then in a foreclosure situation, the banks are not in a position to pursue you for a personal deficiency.  In other words, they cannot sue you for the loss on the home.  We had our lawyers check this out and it's due to laws dating back to the Depression era.<p>At the time that a house is sold, there are three parties agreeing to the price: the buyer, the appraiser, and the mortgage lender.  So if a home goes down in value, all parties share the risk.  It's no different than a VC investing in a small business.  If the business fails, the VC cannot sue the managers of the business to get their money back.  The same holds true with foreclosures in California.  In the depression, this same situation happened, property values fell, people lost their jobs and were sued by the banks to pay them back.  Bad stuff.<p>We are both pursuing short sales of our homes, but are perfectly OK with a foreclosure.  In both situations, our credit ratings will take a huge hit, but they recover in 7 years for a foreclosure, and in 2 years if it's a short sale.  So we asked ourselves, is our credit score worth 300K?  And with some simple financial modeling, we figured that it was about 10 years for the property values to break even.  And the trade off was simple.<p>The short sale does turn into cancelled debt, though, and the IRS will get a 1099-C.  Cancelled debt counts as income, which makes it taxable.  Except the US govt passed the 2007 mortgage debt relief act, which makes cancelled debt from a mortgage tied to your primary residence an exception.  You do not have to pay income tax on it.  This is valid through the 2012 calendar year.<p>At the state tax level, if the home has cancelled debt, it's still seen as a loss sales against the orginal value of the home.  And losses are not taxable.<p>So this is a great situation financially - no liability to the mortgage company, no federal or state tax.  Really bad credit for a couple years :(.   But as a question of opportunity cost, this seemed to make the most sense.<p>In order to pursue this, both of us had to stop making all payments on the mortgages.  We both got harrassing debt collection calls for awhile, but once you get into the foreclosure process, they eventually die down.  We each will get 6-12 months of living in our homes for free, so in some ways that is a loss recovery.<p>Hope this helps some of you...",1278685482

1500669,comment,1499019,1500011,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"Thanks for succumbing to my charms and delurking, haha. Really though, I appreciate the thoughts.<p>You could say I'm making up for lost time since I did take a couple of years completely off of programming to do a few things, including a lot of voice study and some semi-pro paying operetta gigs. That left me nearly unemployable for about a year, and I'm just really starting to re-establish myself career wise, and I am more dedicated to programming than I've ever been before, and I'm enjoying it a lot more than ever before. I'm also far less interesting to women than ever before:) I can handle it though, since I'm becoming the person I want to be which I have decided is more important than meeting a woman, at least for a few years.<p>Yes I'm monotonous. I pretty much have nothing in common and nothing to offer a woman, yes I seriously believe this. If I were a woman I'd honestly want to pick a taller, more attractive, friendlier, and much more charming guy like you. I'm fierce, I'm driven, I'm focused on tunnel vision, and right now I don't give a fuck about trying fake some stupid personality full of flowery feelings. This thread has given me enough anger to want to code for about 50 hours during my four day weekend and I'm quite thrilled by this.<p>I'm fascinated by all ideas, especially the ones that bore the shit out of women. (Math, hard science, programming fundamentals, nerdy trivia.) I've tried travel and it's not just that I'm not interested, I actively dislike it, and don't want to do it. I don't need to actually be in a new place to discover new ideas. I don't need to try new foods either, I eat to have a killer body right now. But really I'm an interesting person, and I make friends very easily, but generally only with nerdy men who are also chronically single, heh.<p>There are a few things I've learned trying different approaches on online personals for almost a year. (In addition to making up desperate ways of trying to avoid the yawning cataclysm of misogyny:) ) One is that for a man in his thirties, potential doesn't mean shit, and underachieving is repulsive. I need to fix that, I absolutely do.<p>Again this is who I am, and it's who I enjoy being, and I am quite conscious that any personality I would craft myself toward to be attractive to women would be nearly the complete opposite. But one thing is for sure, I may be frustrated (and man oh man am I frustrated), but I'm not average, and I sure am not a chump.<p>In ways I envy you that the person you are and want to be is someone women are interested in, so that you don't have to face this conflict of interest every day and can do what is naturally invigorating to you, without being like a modern day monk who trades off discipline, enlightenment, and intellectual invigoration for years of complete involuntary celibacy:)",1278685300

Who cares whether or not it will replace or complement Obj-C, sliced bread or even the internal combustion engine. GC is the key to the iOS port. Not there yet, so no option at the moment. Of course the future (maybe distant, maybe near) will bring GC to iOS and MacRuby with it. No need for reinventing the wheel.",1278684171

I'd also hazard to note, at the risk of sounding like a get-off-my-lawn prescriptive grammarian, that many garden path sentences achieve their ambiguity via hanging prepositions, e.g.:<p>>The cotton clothing is made of grows in Mississippi.<p>Yet the most general pattern seems to be a simple matter of loading too many words into the subject clause [1], e.g.:<p>>The car driven past the barn crashed.<p>We don't reach the verb until the last word, which not only opens the door to ambiguity but also produces flaccid prose. You will produce tighter, sharper sentences by front-loading the predicate verb.<p>[1] - edited from ""too many clauses"" as per telemachos's astute reply.",1278684037

I never had the chance to try any other dynamics packages that build on Windows, but I'd recommend shying away from ODE; this is a ""devil I know, devil I don't"" situation where the devil I know is pretty evil.<p>You'll find that ODE can be downright Windows-hostile in pieces of its implementation that have nothing to do with GNU toolchain issues. Take a look at <a href=""http://www.ode.org/old_list_archives/2003-October/010046.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ode.org/old_list_archives/2003-October/010046.htm...</a> for the most common problem; they don't care that the stack has different restrictions in Windows and Linux. You'll also find ODE to be downright thread-hostile; the entire library is non-reentrant (they built their own non-threadsafe layer on top of malloc inside the engine; you can't trust any two functions to be callable from separate threads, even if they have logically nothing to do with each other).<p>ODE is the first physics package most people seem to suggest, but I think it's more trouble than it's worth.",1278684018

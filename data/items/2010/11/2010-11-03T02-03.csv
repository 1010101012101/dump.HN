I don't really have a solution, though.<p>Voting for someone outside of those 2 parties is only a waste of time because so many people are doing such a good job of convincing everyone that it is. If the >50% of the population that never votes all went out and voted third party, even if they were different third parties, then maybe some of them would qualify for government $, and then maybe one of them could get even more supporters in the next election with that money.<p>By not voting you're taking away your .000001% influence on the outcome.

If you check in fifty revisions to an incompressible 10MB file, Subversion's client-side space usage stays constant The space used by any distributed SCM will grow rapidly in proportion to the number of revisions, because the differences between each revision are large.<p>> In addition, it's often difficult or, more usually, impossible to merge different versions of a binary file. Subversion's ability to let a user lock a file, so that they temporarily have the exclusive right to commit changes to it, can be a significant advantage to a project where binary files are widely used.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/how-did-we-get-here.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/how-did-we-get-here.html</a>",1288752926

1863416,comment,1863058,1863058,0,0,tdavis,,,"Python could certainly use a generic payments library—like what libcloud has done for cloud providers. And I don't want to demoralize you or ridicule the work done already. However, there are a number of problems with the implementation as it stands that make it a bad idea to ask for contributors at this stage:<p>1. There are no tests. How can I be expected to contribute to your project when there's no way I can ensure a change doesn't break existing functionality, or even works itself? Testing remote APIs is a bit of a hassle, but it's what mocking was made for. Short of signing up for multiple payment gateways, there's no current way to test any change I make.<p>2. No setup.py support. This will likely further limit the number of people who contribute as it increases the barrier to entry. A proper project structure is a relatively easy thing that saves you a ton of time in aggregate.<p>3. There is no coherent developer API. Why does XMLGatewayInterface exist if only one gateway uses it? Why isn't there a generic GatewayInterface that abstracts things further, for non-XML APIs? If you're not going to use ABCs or strict interfaces (like zope.interface), you should at least have well-formed documentation: most ivar conventions (Foo.API_BASE, etc.) aren't mentioned anywhere. Why are there exceptions in the lib module that are only used by one gateway (or none)?<p>4. There are a multitude of minor design decisions that, if followed by contributors, will likely cause you pain down the road. Using print for debug output, relative imports, random error handling, ""entrapping"" functions (why would a function take two optional parameters that are immediately checked for non-None status?), etc.<p>To be clear, I'm very glad you're working on this—it's a difficult (at least incredibly tedious) problem that I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate a Python solution for, myself included. But I don't think this is a very good time to be asking people to fork and contribute. You need a proper foundation built before trying to solicit contributions or you'll end up with a bunch of code you'll need to rewrite later instead of a comparatively small amount you should rewrite now.<p>As the library author, it's your responsibility to build a cohesive, general-yet-customizable, clear interface upon which people can build and test their own gateway drivers. If you do that, I promise you you'll have contributors in no time. It's exactly what we did with libcloud and we now support almost every cloud provider out there and even have a nearly API-compliant Java fork (just to lend some credibility to my rambling).",1288752661

1863370,comment,1862473,1862473,0,0,mindviews,,,"Let me grab two key excerpts from the article (one from the beginning and one from the end) and reverse the order in which they appear.<p>> Taken individually, members of the New Elite are isolated from mainstream America as a result of lifestyle choices that are nobody's business but their own. But add them all up, and they mean that the New Elite lives in a world that doesn't intersect with mainstream America in many important ways. When the tea party says the New Elite doesn't get America, there is some truth in the accusation.<p>> What sets the tea party apart from other observers of the New Elite is its hostility, rooted in the charge that elites are isolated from mainstream America and ignorant about the lives of ordinary Americans.<p>Taken in that sense (and I believe that is the basic point of the article) there is reason to believe that a large segment of the population feels unrepresented.  Probably unrespected, too.  Looking at some of the early comments I can see HN-ers writing ""Why should we care about X?"" or ""What makes X more American?"" when X is characteristic of small town, rural, or blue collar America?  Despite the slant the article implies, X isn't <i>more</i> American, but it <i>is</i> still American.<p>This is my theory: the Tea Party folks see the things that the ""New Elites"" care about and see ""New Elite culture"" on TV/etc. and in that sense have some exposure to it, but the reverse doesn't seem to be true.  Those on the bottom spend more time looking up than those at the top spend looking down.  And there are very few non-""New Elites"" in positions of power to represent them.  That's my best guess.<p>When people in power make decisions that can affect thousands or millions, you don't want to have a blind spot that misses how your actions will impact or be viewed by a large swath of the population.  It does seem like the ""New Elite"" occupies many positions of power in government and society as a whole.  And it looks at least plausible that the ""New Elites"" have a cultural blind spot for the people that now rally under a Tea Party banner.  Despite some of the political slanting of the article, I think that's an important point to recognize.",1288751840

Companies are finally rethinking the OS (iOS, ChromeOS), compilers (LLVM), processor architectures (ARM, integrated graphics).<p>Kasparov probably thinks such steps should not be driven by market forces alone, but by technologists interested in experimentation. The right market conditions came about after decades of the same old more MHz, more HD space rat race. The market is not fast enough, it has other priorities, like getting the products to everybody.<p>Our biggest technological leaps came about when people with vision got others to invest big.

There were a lot of elderly people that showed up, including some that had so much trouble completing the ballot that they may have been better off with an absentee ballot.  I saw a few first-time/young voters, but I just don't think many of them feel this election is important because it is not a presidential election.<p>Get out there and vote next time, kids.",1288749916

Most of HN readers likely fit the stereotype that the author is attempting to project in this article.<p>But that's what he is making: a stereotype and only a stereotype.<p>His assertions read more like assumptions that only sparingly drew on sociological information.  When he referred to, I believe, a single sociological tome, he only considered  ""elite"" schools.  He neglected those of us who did not attend Ivy League (UVa here and I was a miserable college student indeed) and those who did not attend college at all!  Instead, he seemed to prefer to pick bones with his journalistic peers.<p>Living in Worcester County, Maryland for the past couple of years, I find that I did not understand the ""Digital Divide"" until meeting for myself children with no computer or internet connection at home.  Are these children likely to become the next Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Mark Zuckerburg?  I highly doubt it.  Even if they have it within them, this environment does not care to foster those interests.  Instead, the local ""vocational tech"" school seems to emphasize and curriculum involving auto repair and HVAC.  This makes me sad.  And it makes me just a touch more sympathetic to this clearly embittered journalist.<p>Bring on the down votes.",1288749719

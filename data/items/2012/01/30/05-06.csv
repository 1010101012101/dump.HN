You wouldn't call this the West's ""return"" to the call center industry; you just say the need for the industry had been eliminated.<p>I can, however, imagine a scenario where you are kind of right.  It could be that 3D printing requires a moderate size industry of 3D-printer servicemen who need to be physically present.  In this case, the jobs could move back to the wealthy countries simply because the printers can't be remotely serviced.  Nevertheless, this still requires a contraction of the manufacturing industry: if it didn't require substantially fewer resources be devoted to manufacturing with 3D printers, we wouldn't move away from the build-it-in-China model.",1327903123

Adderall made me feel high, and seemed to encourage me to focus like a laser beam on low-level details. Dexadrine, on the other hand, has a very subtle effect on me. I've never felt high when taking it. It's more like a gradual transition into being able to focus at will. When it wears off I can no longer focus easily. On weekends I usually take half the usual dosage, and sometimes I skip taking it all together. When I skip it, aside from difficulty paying attention/focusing, I have mild withdrawal symptoms like feeling tired, headache and an increased appetite.<p>Having said all this, I want to point out that my doctor told me that different medications work for different people.

You can buy a lot at heroku for $10,000/month (the minimal cost of a full time deployment / sysadmin / dbadmin,) including I'd imagine some rather hands-on support.<p>This article seems to downplay the great advances that have been made in ""cloud"" deployment.

Get the laughter out of your system now........<p>Metallica is represented in the US by Warner Bros. Records and internationally by UMG. As such, while WBR was fronting the development and maintenance of the site, we had to enable Universal International marketing to sell it through all their international retail partners worldwide and ex-US.<p>That was over 30 different partners. So imagine trying to integrate into commerce systems for 30 partners, in dozens of languages and currencies.<p>In the end we resorted to the easiest API in the world: 16 digit alphanumeric codes and a huge HTML table to track everything for reporting.<p>It sucked.<p>International rights aren't just a stupid thing that is invented by content and media companies to make your life harder.

A few years ago, a truck driver in Oklahoma was transferring pig shit to a lagoon when he and his truck went over the side. It took almost three weeks to recover his body. In 1992, when a worker making repairs to a lagoon in Minnesota began to choke to death on the fumes, another worker dived in after him, and they died the same death. In another instance, a worker who was repairing a lagoon in Michigan was overcome by the fumes and fell in. His fifteen-year-old nephew dived in to save him but was overcome, the worker&#x27;s cousin went in to save the teenager but was overcome, the worker&#x27;s older brother dived in to save them but was overcome, and then the worker&#x27;s father dived in.

The reason this is needed is obvious: if you are being taught way beyond your capability you won&#x27;t learn anything, and it&#x27;s a disservice to be taught way below your capability as well.<p>b) in the top 50% of your <i>local</i> group of students, for self esteem reasons and also because you&#x27;ll start to feel like studying and working hard pays off if you seem to be successful in school relative to your peers.<p>There&#x27;s a real tradeoff between these two sometimes. Given two identical kids, if you send one to the school that is not up to his &quot;gifted&quot; potential but he is the smartest kid in his class he may well do better in the end than the one you send to a gifted school but he is obviously at the bottom of his class. The first will certainly be happier and perhaps learn the life lessons and habits that will make him super successful in high school, college and beyond.<p>We can at least start to address a) with these gifted programs and special education for the exceptionally challenged and so on. But addressing b) is also important and the laws of statistics sort of prevent us dividing kids into groups where everyone is above average for their group. In theoretical terms I can envision some sort of frequent rotation system where you&#x27;re constantly shuffled from class to class so that one week you&#x27;re top of your class and another you&#x27;re bottom. Perhaps that would even help illustrate to kids the extremely hard to learn lesson that judging yourself against others is fruitless and destructive.",1446580272

One party write a standard contract in a way that mitigates their risk in order to provide a service and another party signs the contract to recieve the service with understanding that the benefits are worth the risk of dealing with an entity that has significantly more power then they do. I could argue the person was misniformed and mislead into signing an agreement with a relgious organization and should be free from the contract... but I could make the same argument for student loans, credit cards, mortgages, etc.<p>I can see value, and certainly abuse, in people agreeing to allow their religious organizations to arbitrate civil disputes... it would seem that people should be allowed to make the choice and suffer the consequences if the agreement is within the established law.",1446580271

In hot places where your trying to use the smallest fire possible they don&#x27;t work very well.<p>Further, they generally work better the taller they are which gets expensive.

HN never had such a policy, nor any, for that matter.<p>pg specifically said before handing over the site that he didn&#x27;t mind downvoting to disagree. I have seen no movement from new leadership on this; in fact, new leadership have doubled down on some of pg&#x27;s worse calls. With the graying out of comments added in to the downvote encouragement, effectively that situation encourages you to only offer uncontroversial opinion lest your thoughts become invisible and silenced. It&#x27;s not a heavy thought exercise to see where allegations of groupthink come from.<p>That, along with the fact that my account was marked as an instantly-penalized troublemaker at some point and I only found out by emailing many months later even though my email was in my profile all along, is one of the reasons I no longer contribute here. That was a startling discovery, that individuals get marked as troublemakers based upon the opinion of a moderator and, in my case, a single comment. Think about that for a second, and think about all the comments you&#x27;ve ever made, and the fact that HN usernames are part of the YC application process. A lot clicked for me once I stepped back and thought about it.<p>As I said, don&#x27;t confuse HN with Reddit. The leadership of Hacker News has a large amount of zeal and actively steers conversation toward arbitrary positivity and civility, including moderation decisions you would find questionable anywhere else. Before appealing to decency and policy when a comment gets downvotes as you have, just remember that. The irony is that HN loves to mock Reddit, but in many ways it is three times the community HN is.<p>And please don&#x27;t complain about downvotes.

It wasn&#x27;t announced in advance.<p>2. It wasn&#x27;t adequately tested in advance.<p>3. The replacement system wasn&#x27;t compatible with the pre-existing one. Its dynamics are significantly different, most notably in that it simply <i>is not a mailing list</i>.<p>4. Chef and Discourse both come off smelling exceptionally poorly, and with highly tarnished reputations.<p>My own first awareness of the transfer came as, while in the midst of travel and away from my typical email and computing systems, a Gmail inbox of mine exploded with what appeared to be miscategorised Chef mailing list items. Gmail fouls up filtering sufficiently often that I&#x27;m aware of this, but the problem persisted, largely overwhelming my mailbox.<p>I was relying principally on an Android tablet and either the Gmail app or Mobile web interface. For a tool which claims to make using and organising your emails far more viable, <i>neither of these offers access to Gmail filters</i>. I&quot;ve still not been able to access or update those due to other concerns.<p>It took a considerable time to figure out what the hell had changed. Clearing my spam folder for the first time in a few weeks, I took a look at the new Chef emails, and found that they weren&#x27;t email list messages but <i>forum</i> notifications, and that there wasn&#x27;t a simple unsubscribe.<p>Clicking the unsubscribe link, I was presented with a log-in screen for a service I&#x27;d never used.<p>I&#x27;ve emailed Nathan at Chef directly requesting my removal. I suspect he&#x27;s busy. I also indicated that I&#x27;d be configuring Gmail filters to nuke <i>all</i> future Chef and Discourse content.<p>As for Discourse itself, it took a few articles for me to recognise it, but this is Jeff Atwood&#x27;s new gig -- he&#x27;s of Coding Horror and Stack Exchange fame. I&#x27;ve followed Jeff&#x27;s work for some time and am generally impressed by it. I&#x27;m aware of challenges SE has faced with its frequently too-aggressive moderators (there&#x27;s a balance between information content and quality, and simply maintaining the social lubrication of <i>conversation</i>). I&#x27;d read some of his earlier discussions on Discourse and its aims, and been impressed.<p>The implementation, <i>particularly</i> with this specific system transition, is an utter fuck-up.<p>If Chef had simply cut the cord, sent a &quot;so long and thanks for all the fish, see you on the flipside&quot; message, <i>informing mailing list members where the new discussion could be found</i>, things would have been far better.<p>Or, if Discourse had <i>completed a mailing-list gateway system, and provided import tools for existing lists.</i><p>The Gmail interaction is an unfortunate one and out of both Chef and Discourse&#x27;s immediate hands, but something a discussion <i>for, about, and largely used by sysadmins with both massive email loads and highly-tuned filter systems</i> should have been utterly fucking obvious. I&#x27;m not particularly keen on calling folks idiots on HN, but Nathan and whomever were responsible for the transition at Discourse have earned their idiot stripes.<p>There&#x27;s a strongly cautionary tale about committing to proprietary systems in the first place, which appears to be what Chef&#x27;s initial email solution was. The Coderanger post-mortem fills in details here I wasn&#x27;t aware of. The most obvious continuing fault is that Chef are jumping from frying pan to fire.<p>But if other projects want an excellent example of what not to do, here it is.",1446578606

The idea that all persons could be held answerable to one set of rules and principles is so alluring that you have people even today trying to hold secular American leadership accountable to them.<p>Religion, initially, came in two flavors. One for the aristocracy, which was oriented around finding meaning in the many ethically and morally awful things they had to do to maintain their territories, human capital, and privileged lifestyles.<p>The other was for commoners, who needed ways to cooperate and trust each other. If two people didn&#x27;t know each other, then they could still trust each other if they spoke the same language, worshipped the same gods, paid tithes to the same temples. Religion was how they ordered their thoughts about what was right and wrong. It didn&#x27;t matter for the people at the time what was scientifically or rigorously right, just that it was the same throughout a people.<p>Until the age of Christianity, rulers had no interest in how the commoners believed. But as the world became more and more connected and the scale of warfare grew to where conscription became more and more necessary, rulers increasingly started to try to control how their populace worshipped.<p>Fast-forward to the age of Gutenberg. Bibles getting printed in the vernacular, so that ordinary people could read them, was a game changer. All of a sudden, religious hypocrisy became a thing, people with power became accountable for how they used that power, rather than just making up interpretations amongst themselves as they went along.",1446578189

The market for frontend devs is both competitive and very liquid: there are many job opportunities and many frontend developers.  As a result, starting salaries tend to be high, and you can very quickly &quot;rise to what you&#x27;re worth&quot;: if you don&#x27;t like your boss or your company is underpaying you, jump ship.<p>However, frontend tech tends to expire every 5 years.  This is part of the reason why starting salaries are high: junior developers can compete effectively with senior ones.  If you go backend, you tend to amass a steady stream of domain & infrastructural knowledge about the company which makes you significantly more valuable to them over time.  Raises and promotions follow, even if that knowledge is of limited usefulness on the open market.<p>Whether you&#x27;d prefer one or the other partially depends on how you would like to manage your career.  The OP in this subthread indicates that he&#x27;s drawn to the <i>craftsmanship</i>, the idea of steadily making something better over time, and this style tends to suit backend dev better.  I tend to be drawn toward <i>discovery</i>, the process of finding loopholes & gaps in the market and filling them with new solutions, so for me frontend & entrepreneurship is more useful.  (Frontend dev tends to be a more useful skill for founders, because almost every startup needs an appealing frontend but most can get by with a half-assed backend until they hire more engineers.  Witness DropBox vs. Tarsnap - they came out at the same time and both use AWS for storage, but DropBox built a beautiful frontend and a minimally-functional backend, while Tarsnap barely built a frontend at all but has the most sophisticated secure backend I&#x27;ve seen in a product.)

They are just people with no more ability to be good than anyone else.”<p>If you don&#x27;t grow up in an area that has a very heavy Christian presence it can be hard to understand how very conservative/evangelical Christians think. Many of them believe, honestly and truly, that they are incapable of being wrong because they have been sanctified and saved and therefore even if they perform a transgression no one on Earth has the authority to call them out on it. But see, since they&#x27;re saved, Jesus forgives them, so no one can call them out on their sin because no one is without sin, so best to just let it go.<p>It&#x27;s an extremely insidious mindset because there&#x27;s no arguing with it. There&#x27;s no way to get someone who believes that they are morally right to budge even an inch because they 100% do not believe in capitulating to anyone other than Jesus Christ- and since the only source of what He thinks is the Bible and it can be interpreted in about a thousand different ways... you see where this is going. Their personal definitions of what&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are very, very different from people who did not grow up in the religious culture and there&#x27;s no way to bring them around to another way of thinking. It happens within the culture too- my father in law and his lifelong best friend had a falling out about 10 years ago over a very small, nitpicky religious matter (they were both elders in their church and disagreed over the way some church finances were distributed) and my father in law straight up stopped talking to his best friend because his friend would not capitulate and come around to my father in law&#x27;s way of thinking. My Father in Law believed, and still believes, that he was 100% in the right and that his best friend was deceived by the devil and that&#x27;s why their friendship had to end. And this is over something like &quot;Should we put the church&#x27;s nest egg all in a savings account or should we take half of it and put it in a Money Market account instead?&quot;<p>I point this out to add some context to this type of arbitration since, if you didn&#x27;t grow up in an area where this was just a normal fact of society, you&#x27;re probably scratching your head wondering how in the world this is even a thing.<p>Even growing up Southern Baptist below the Bible Belt I had no idea that Religious Arbitration was a thing until I read this article.

In order for Google to effectively serve you ads (and convince advertisers it&#x27;s worth their prices), they accumulate <i>vast</i> amounts of information about their users. From some perspective one&#x27;s identity is largely based on or equivalent to one&#x27;s purchases, tastes, interests, friendships, knowledge, etc. Advertisers (like Google) try to know as many of these as possible about everyone they can, and I can see how for many people this is equivalent to Google selling &quot;you&quot; -- they have a digital representation of your identity, and their ability to comprehend it is the real service that sits behind the advertising.",1446577331

If you&#x27;re looking to end drone strikes before the 2020 race, you&#x27;re SOL. There was only one candidate who opposed warrant-less drone assassinations, and he just withdrew from the race (Chafee).<p>Rand Paul did filibuster Brennan&#x27;s nomination on this exact issue, but he has since watered down his stance to the point where it&#x27;s basically unrecognizable.<p>The other candidates range from lukewarm support (&quot;we should do this, but only rarely&quot;) to enthusiastic support, to the ones who actually carried out and executed the drone strike program (Clinton).",1446577314

My phone was one of many with a flaw that cast a purple haze on low light photos, rendering it nearly useless in low light.  Foolishly I waited awhile in hopes that a software update would fix it.<p>HTC offered some sort of replacement program but that would require me to go without a phone for weeks.<p>Eventually Verizon sent me a replacement unit whose camera was even worse.  I decided my next phone would be an iPhone.  I now have the 6 Plus and it&#x27;s the best point and shoot camera I&#x27;ve ever had, period (even counting standalone cameras.)  If something goes wrong with the phone I know I can go to an Apple retail store and get it fixed or replaced immediately, not in weeks.",1446577284

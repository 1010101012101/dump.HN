I am also going to say something pretty not PC.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m sure there are lots of people I have met in my life that can&#x27;t be taught to play Chess.<p>I used to work in a restaurant and I trained new hires, you wouldn&#x27;t believe the incompetence of the people who we hired. That place was a revolving door, we only kept maybe 20% of the people I trained, maybe less. We were asking them to serve customers and memorize many things, simple tasks for me, but very hard tasks for most of the people I trained. After maybe a month or so the incompetent ones got fired for not being able to do the job. They probably only could work somewhere where they did very simple tasks. I hated it because I always had to train, and I didn&#x27;t like training, but I had to train anyways, because I was the best one there at training, said my boss.<p>99% of them seemed like they were really trying. Most if not all of them needed the job (why else would you work at a restaurant for low pay?)<p>He hired knowing most of the people he hired weren&#x27;t going to work out.<p>That&#x27;s just one example.",1389121151

Just wander into any Starbucks around 4PM, especially in New York or any major metro and you&#x27;ll see hordes of people accessing wifi. Is it crowded? Sure? But this doesn&#x27;t solve that problem. This just eliminates some login steps and provides value to the provider of the wifi.<p>Do you feel that trading in your privacy to simplify the login problem (and allow you to avoid actually paying the people whose space you are occupying when you use their power and wifi and restroom and hvac) is worth it? It isn&#x27;t for me, and so I ask, what problem is it solving?",1389121060
7019072,comment,7017843,7018373,46,0,kyro,,,"You guys are really predictable. You act as if the founders never considered existing networks/solutions, that they just shipped a useless app without any thought. Whether it&#x27;ll become a hit remains to be seen, but open your minds just a teency-weency bit to try and understand what these guys are doing.<p>I see a lot of things around this city that I&#x27;m curious about, but haven&#x27;t the faintest clue about how to start researching them. And even if I can find an article or two online, there is a massive amount of valuable contextual information that&#x27;s usually missing, unless I scour the web for obscure blogs. For instance, what are those little people statues at the 14th St. 8th Ave. subway station? A google search doesn&#x27;t return anything immediately enough for me. And many of these questions are spur of the moment. So posting a picture with a question is significantly better in capturing in-the-moment curiosities.<p>But why can&#x27;t you post to Facebook or Twitter?! Because I have tons of questions that I&#x27;d rather not bombard my friends with. And because the chances of getting just a reply go up the larger the network. If I can tap into the minds of my friends&#x27; friends, why not? FB and Twitter are not platforms for asking questions. There&#x27;s a reason why you never get Quora-like answers. Or why you aren&#x27;t connected to people who&#x27;re likely to have the answers you&#x27;re looking for. There are fundamentally different use cases between FB and Twitter and Quora, and perhaps now Jelly.<p>So please stop acting thick and think for a second why this might be a little different. Yes, you can ask friends for answers. Yes you can search Wikipedia. But do they have all the answers? Are there types of questions they&#x27;re just not suited to handle? Can the answers be more rich? Can getting those answers be easier and more enjoyable? Maybe.",1389121049

7019070,comment,7017222,7018096,5,0,mturmon,,,"Here&#x27;s a troubling insight on the relationship of physical and mental torture from Ian Buruma&#x27;s recent review (<a href""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jan/09/china-reeducation-through-horror/?pagination=fals"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jan/09/china-r...</a>) of a book on Maoist China:<p>In most accounts, the distress caused by endless indoctrination, public denunciation, and self-criticism was worse than physical torture. Physical pain still allows the victim to retreat into himself. After days, months, years of mental torture there is no longer a self to retreat into. Besides self-abasement, victims were made to show their sincerity by persecuting others, sometimes friends or relatives. In many cases, suicide was the only way out. But ideally, if a person had finally reached the stage when his confessions were totally convincing, there was no longer any gap between acting and natural behavior, between faked and true thoughts. The process ended, in the phrase of a Chinese former victim, with “the physical and mental liquidation of oneself by oneself.”",1389121025

7019051,comment,7017198,7018889,4,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, the traditional distinction between professors and degree holders who aren&#x27;t professors wasn&#x27;t part of the guild-training system, but probably better maps onto an idea like patronage. Someone who completed the doctorate was &quot;done&quot; with the training process, a certified master fully licensed to hold lectures and supervise theses. But this did not in itself come with any salary or position. The exact situation varied by country, but in Germany such a person might be a Privatdozent, someone who earned a living by giving lectures (often traveling from university to university) and tutoring students. That&#x27;s somewhat analogous to a master painter who subsequently earned a living from portrait commissions.<p>A professor then is simply a master who, rather than earning a living as a craftsman, has a position and salary paid by a patron or institution. One might compare to a painter who became a salaried court painter, or one who received regular stipends from the Académie de peinture et de sculpture, rather than earning an income from seeking commissions or giving lessons.<p>I think the common way people view the situation has changed in part because these craft occupations are more difficult to sustain, so you&#x27;re not really seen as &quot;done&quot; until you&#x27;ve landed a regular full-time job. Like being a painter without a salary, being a lecturer without a salary is nowadays a very precarious position. There used to be enough wealthy patrons paying enough in portrait commissions and tutoring fees for such careers to be make for a decent middle-class living, but it&#x27;s not a common career anymore, so now people typically either look for a full-time academic position, or look for a full-time job elsewhere. You can temporarily hang around academia as an adjunct lecturer, but it&#x27;s not a good or stable living.",1389120857

And the simplifying assumptions are things we could get away with while solving the task at hand.<p>Traditional OCR pipeline would be to use some heuristics to find line of text in an image, use some other heuristics to break line of text into candidate characters. Some candidate blobs may need to be merged to make a single character, so you use a separate character classifier pre-trained on correctly segmented characters to score the candidates, and then Viterbi/A* search on those scores to find the most likely interpretation of input.<p>Many problems with this -- how do you tune the heuristics? How do you recover from  error in an earlier stage of pipeline? How do you get character level ground truth from image/text pairs?<p>With enough engineering time, you can solve those problems, but it&#x27;s a lot of coding and tweaking.

Building a testing habit isn&#x27;t as simple as following some basic tutorials. It&#x27;s a fundamental shift in how you think about writing code and can&#x27;t be summed up in a 5 minute blog, like you say.<p>To address your software, the answer is a little stretchy. For the code that depends on device data, you simulate as little device data as possible needed for your code to work. This means that if you have a method that only needs a device id, you only provide a device id. If you have a method that generates a report, you provide all the data that is needed in the report.<p>Another approach would be to try to group the test data together into common traits. I don&#x27;t know enough about your software to come up with some examples, but you likely don&#x27;t need to collect test data for every single device, but instead data that is representative of every single device.<p>If you want to find me on the twitter (@genericsteele), we could keep this conversation going. I&#x27;m interested in how you see the world of testing and just this thread has helped me think of new perspectives. I would love to figure out you could overcome the obstacles your work is throwing at you.",1389120029

When they do not work, they do not produce things, but they are still consuming things.  Thus, people who do not work yet still consume in a given system reduces the overall level of wealth within that system, which reduces the level of wealth that everyone within that system can enjoy.<p>Thus, from a wealth standpoint, a system with less unemployment is preferable to one with more.<p>Proponents of basic income usually claim that when people are freed from the drudgery of working a normal job, they will be free to be creative, to take risks, to start businesses, and that this new productivity will compensate for the loss of productivity in the traditional system.<p>But that&#x27;s all that is: a claim.  It&#x27;s completely worthless without some kind of data backing it up.  It&#x27;s akin to a preacher saying that God exists because he said that God exists.

Work ethic is no more a racial quality than is the propensity to dance like a fool (edit: by this, I mean white people dancing like fools) or to enjoy eating burritos.  But it is well known that the so-called &#x27;Protestant work ethic&#x27; is a strong component of white American subculture, whereas it exists less strongly in the black subculture.  Other races (such as Asians and Jews) have similar cultural values which encourage a strong work ethic.  The American black subculture, on the other hand, does not seem to instill nearly as high a value on hard work in its children as do the others.  On the contrary, the system is perceived as being a white construct, and black children who are perceived as trying to join that system are often shunned for &#x27;acting white.&#x27;  That is not a racial issue, it&#x27;s a cultural issue, but its genesis has no bearing on the final result where basic income is concerned, at least not in the short run.

I remember a friend who worked for a popular publication in town going through a legal battle over her Twitter account. At the time, companies did not have the naming conventions they do now (@NPRxxxx or @CNNxxxx) that drew the line between personal and professional accounts. When she left the publication, her Twitter account went with her and the publication felt that, since those followers came from her work at the publication, they were owned by them. Now, if your venture fails, absolutely that personal email connection is incredibly invaluable. I just wonder if in other instances it would end up biting you in the ass.",1389118402

If you say 9 hours, I&#x27;d believe 4.5 hours.<p>I&#x27;m describing tested battery life, not anecdotal estimations. E.g. <a href""http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Update-Dell-XPS-12-9Q33-Convertible.100626.0.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Update-Dell-XPS-12-9Q33-...</a>.<p>Battery life obviously depends on your usage scenario, but the one described in the article is very light. Moreover, he&#x27;s using a very low brightness setting, and seems to be using wi-fi intermittently. These points are important to note because on most workloads, the display and the wireless adapter are the major sources of power draw.<p>The usage described in the article is:<p>> I get about 6 hours of usage from a full charge (or more if I leave my desk for breaks and the screen shuts off after 5 minutes, which saves battery). As I mentioned earlier, that&#x27;s usually on the lowest (or second to lowest) screen brightness setting, with the keyboard backlight enabled for about 50-75% of the time, and having Firefox open with 5-10 tabs, sometimes YouTube running in the background for some music, some Terminal windows open, Steam open in the background, Skype running in the background and a few text editor windows open.<p>Since idle background apps should take up very little battery, this seems even lighter than Anand&#x27;s &quot;Light Workload&quot; scripted test, on which the MBA gets 11 hours (close to its rated 12). See: <a href""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7085/the-2013-macbook-air-review-13inch/"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7085/the-2013-macbook-air-revi...</a>. Anand&#x27;s test is at 200 nits (80% screen brightness). The author of this article says he&#x27;s running at the lowest or second-lowest screen brightness, so maybe 10-20% or 30-60 nits. Even with the heavy workload test, which involves constant Wi-Fi activity and 1080p video playback, the MBA gets 5.5 hours.<p>If you mimic the usage in this article, with some apps open in the background, the brightness turned down, and typing into some terminal windows, the MBA would probably get 15+ hours: <a href""http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/18/#battery-benchmark"" rel""nofollo"">http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/10/os-x-10-9/18/#battery-b...</a>.",1389118340

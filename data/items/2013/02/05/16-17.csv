5171684,comment,5169599,5170090,1,0,tracker1,,,"I spend far more time writing back-end code (automation, data handling, and services) more than I do front-end code.  Most of that code is so that the front end can be nicer.  Just because the UI I develop is web-based, doesn't mean I don't know how to write effective code.  I do think that JS is an acceptable language for UI development.  It is hands down the most widely used language on the planet.  Gnome isn't deprecating the other interfaces, it's just that they are steering new developers to the JS interfaces.  I do think that the Python guys are having a pretty bad attitude about it though.  They had to pick <i>A</i> language as their base for documentation purposes, and I think JS is probably the most pragmatic choice here.<p>I have to admit that I'm a bit of a JS fan (warts and all), and with NodeJS and MongoDB it's been a far more fluid development experience than other groups of technologies I've had to work with over the past 17 years in software development.  It's a pretty decent language to work with.",1360083505

I get some Haskell but you'll have to explain specifics to me (I'm certainly willing to change my mind!).<p>Are you using a framework, or developing one? Who gets to choose the concurrency strategy?<p>As a framework provider, if you provide LWPs to ppl (like provide open and read and all that stuff for them) so they can write sequential code as if it were sequential, but it's actually nonblock, what happens in C/C++ is that when they need to integrate third-party stuff, life gets really complicated. Clients are the clients of the API I'm talking about, which is a hypothetical ""lightweight thread"" based API where everything just works as per original post.<p>>>Threading sucks.\n>Why?<p>Well, in an ideal model of computation we wouldn't need to synchronise things. This is the great attraction of likesay a node-based model where we run our stuff as synchronous events. Once you accept threading you need to care about who does what to which at what time. Also you need to figure out e.g. how your dependencies are thread-safe and under what conditions. You might have berkeley db where contexts are not generally thread-safe but handles can be if you set the right flags, for example.<p>>>Which ones do you think are good?\n>The one that comes with ghc.<p>That's cool :) I should probably learn more about it. The really cynical part of my mind is going ""please tell me about this magical solution to integrating different event loops and concurrency models"" and the less cynical part is open to your suggestions.",1360083296

This is one reason a no-profit business can attract loyal investors -- that and the promise of future profits, of course.<p>> No-profit-but-pays-the-salaries is a lifestyle business, which is great and all, but the equity is worthless.<p>Not so. A company's equity represents the company's value, not its present profitability (although some equity investors require profits, other are satisfied to see growth). One can grow a business by running at an apparent 0% profit in a way that causes the business size and customer base to grow over time. The argument can be made that business expansions can only result from profits,  but this can be structured as essential equipment replacements, personnel increases and so forth, in a way that profits remain at zero.",1360082900

C/C++ is too expensive effort-wise, in development, in maintenance and in monitoring. Erlang is awesome, but it's too slow for some things. .Net is not robust on non-windows platforms (I'm not sure about this, but this is the common perception). Go is slower than Java, lacks the huge ecosystem, and also doesn't provide all the JVM goodies like runtime instrumentation and profiling, hot code swapping, good monitoring etc. Rust is too immature (and won't give you those benefits either).

If you're a Dell shareholder today, you can sell the shares right now at $13.38.  This is a $0.27 discount (2.0%) to the agreed upon buy-out price.  The shareholders today are willing to give up that 2% in additional gain, because the risk to them is that the sale falls through, and the price of DELL will fall back to the pre-buyout price of around $9.97 (early January price).  That would be a 25% loss.  Giving up the potential for 2% in gains in exchange for eliminating the risk of 25% loss?

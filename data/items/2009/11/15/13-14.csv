It <i>should</i> trick the muscles in your eye (the ones giving you the eye strain) to relax, too. YMMV, but it's worked for me.",1258293358
942922,comment,942642,942775,0,0,miloshh,,,"Well, that depends on the job... but indeed, the interviews most likely to ask these questions are exactly for the more pragmatic jobs. No university will ask prospective professors these things; instead, they will ask about what research they did in the past and what is their vision for future research.",1258293351

But they can also be used to put down the candidate no matter what the answer (what, you would put the expensive Boeing in water??? you must be crazy!).",1258293016

No. It's a full clean build, and that 11 seconds also includes preprocessing some API header files.",1258291431

Be strict: turn off all distractions until the hour is up. It sounds like you <i>have</i> time, but it's the knowledge that you <i>have</i> time that causes you to procrastinate.<p>Treat it like an important deadline. When you finish, enjoy the sense of achievement, take a break, then start the next hour. The goal ultimately is to be able to concentrate (productively) for 3-4 hours at a time.<p>Why not put a big countdown clock on the wall (that's what I've done!)",1258290884

There is not much room between the exact right answer and no answer at all.<p>The Boeing question on the other hand (like many other Fermi Problems [1]) might help you understand how the interviewee approaches a problem he doesn't know the answer to and whether or not he is capable of making sane predictions. But even though I think they are not completely useless, I expect a well prepared candidate to score better than some less well prepared, but in other regards superior candidates.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem</a>",1258290844
942900,comment,942256,942572,0,0,m_eiman,,,"<i>wherein quality is indeed valuable without there being demand for it</i><p>Value is derived from demand and supply. If there is <i>no</i> demand, there can be no value. If there is demand, there will be value (per supplied unit) if the supply isn't too plentiful.<p>This should mean that, in your example, entry level content should be plentiful and cheap, while the advanced content should be scarce and expensive. Hopefully for the producers of advanced content, the advanced audience will get so much more enjoyment per unit of content that they feel the higher price is justified.<p>To say that more people ""should"" go through the effort of learning to like the advanced content is pretty elitist, but most of all it doesn't take into consideration everything that they are doing in their lives. Just because some college students think it's worthwhile to learn the intricacies of some obscure tv series it doesn't mean that it's worthwhile for everyone else.",1258290818

Unpublished information is still available to some group of people, stored on disks etc. It could be accidentally or deliberately released. Given the amount of confidential information that does get inappropriately released I would expect this information to, at some point, be seen by people who shouldn't have access to it. Better that the files don't exist in the first place. Maybe it could be a probablistic correlation set at a level which would require a number of votes to obtain sufficient certainty.",1258290475
942896,comment,942095,942353,0,0,nonrecursive,,,"I wonder, however, if adopting the body language of the way you want to feel will make you actually feel that way, in the same way that adopting a facial expression will make you feel the corresponding emotion.<p>And with your suggestion to ""<i>be</i> competent, confident, whatever by know what you're doing and talking about. These postures, gestures, etc, will flow naturally"" - from personal experience I know that <i>being</i> competent does not automatically make me <i>feel</i> competent or confident, and it certainly doesn't make me <i>appear</i> that way.<p>I can easily see how these techniques can be used for bullshitters, but at the same time it might be necessary for someone learning how to honestly feel differently to know how to act differently.<p>Have you ever seen the Dog Whisperer? This guy Cesar Milan works with dogs with huge behavioral problems. With a dog that's incredibly fearful, he sometimes takes its tail and physically lifts it up, so it's in the position that a confident dog would hold its tail. When Cesar does this, the fearful dog becomes noticeably calmer. That's not the only thing Cesar does, but addressing the dog's ""body language"" definitely helps. Probably the same kind of thing works with humans too.",1258290392

942893,comment,941961,942557,0,0,lucumo,,,"Apparently the dominant legal view in Germany (and I guess in more parts of Europe) is that once a sentence is served, the crime is dealt with. If society believes that the sentences are too light, it can change the law, but once a judge has pronounced a sentence, and it's served in the proper way, that's it.<p>""Fame"" is a way of society to hand out punishments outside of the courts of law. Such an extrajudicial punishment is especially annoying when there are mitigating circumstances. Usually those are details that courts bother with, but public opinion doesn't.<p>(Now, that doesn't mean this particular case is easy. Wikipedia also records history. History records the identity of many killers and I believe in a lot of cases that can be an important historical fact. Balancing rights rarely is easy, so I'm happy that we have independent professionals that spent a lot of time thinking about these issues.)",1258290090

7981231,comment,7974203,7975420,2,0,JorgeJetson,,,"All counts of the indictment, including the money laundering, are based upon two conditions.  Both must be true for any of the counts in the indictment to be judged a crime.  These two conditions are:<p>a) use of interstate mail and communications for illegal activity<p>b) the illegal activity is specifically a violation of the California code prohibiting prostitution: facilitation of prostitution.<p>So the federal indictment is completely dependent upon the criminal violation of a state law.  However, myredbook, or its owners, have never been indictment, let alone convicted, by the State of California.  This is after more than a decade of operation.<p>Furthermore there is a federal law stating that web site owners / operators do not take any legal responsibility for the content provided by others.  It does not matter if the web site owners charge or not charge these other parties for using the site.<p>This seems to be a really really bad legal case.  At minimum the feds are presuming that the owners of my redbook would be convicted of a state crime, if the state would just prosecute them.  As we all know, the American legal system presumes innocence until being convicted in a court of law.<p>So legally the feds don&#x27;t seem to really have a case.  All they seem to be doing is hassling the owners of myredbook with the intent of shutting the web site down.<p>So this totally appears to be someone in the justice department driving a moral or religious agenda and not really a legal one.",1404356387

7981228,comment,7977062,7981148,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> That&#x27;s the point of declarative programming and FP is declarative.<p>Declarative programming is a gradient. You can be exposed to a bunch of tedious details in FP and you can abstract over them in OOP. Saying FP is somehow magically declarative (as if that were a thing) leads to profound disappointment when complexity is inevitably encountered.<p>> It&#x27;s the same in Prolog, I&#x27;d think.<p>&quot;Cut&quot; it out :) Also see taming space leaks in Haskell.<p>> There&#x27;s no state to speak of. FP builds the blueprint of the program (one level removed from the way OOP and procedural see things) and gives it to the computer to run it.<p>The primary difference between pure FP and OOP is identity: there is no identity to speak of, things don&#x27;t have names or addresses, they are just values whose equality is determined purely by structure. The inability to name things in FP is a huge drawback, because things actually have names in the real world.<p>State doesn&#x27;t depend on ordering. It depends on time; imperative and even functional languages often convolute the two concepts, but not always (see real FRP, not fake FRP ala Rx). Functional languages eschew state are merely eschewing the notion of time, which makes equational reasoning hard; it takes something like FRP to bring time back into the fold by making it explicit. Still, its quite hard to program interactive apps in pure FP given the intrinsic aversion to time.",1404356305

But they&#x27;re going to do that on the job too, like most of us do. The key would be to get them to explain, in detail, how they solved the problem and why they choose their particular solution, going line by line in the code if needed.<p>I think this is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t put the candidate on the spot. The shyest person should be able to work on their own, and I&#x27;ve never met a programmer so introverted that they couldn&#x27;t explain the work they&#x27;ve already completed. The people who just faked the exercise by copy-pasting should be readily apparent once the detailed questions about their code arise.<p>This is probably an overly simplistic answer but I think it would make a huge difference.

You&#x27;ve been working on a product &quot;in stealth&quot; for 30 years, shown practically nobody outside your company, and provided us with nothing more than a vaporous description of its capabilities (in Businessinsider, no less). I&#x27;m left wondering not only how seriously I should be taking this claim, but also exactly what the claim even is.<p>Artificial intelligence is <i>hard</i>. I did an internship at Numenta [1], where Jeff Hawkins is approaching AI from this same biological-first model. He hypothesized how a small subset of the brain works, constructed a model of it, and admirably hired dozens of engineers to build it. The guys behind the Numenta software are some of the best engineers I&#x27;ve met, with combined centuries of experience, and it&#x27;s taken them almost <i>ten years</i> to get the software to its current, extremely primitive state. Right now, the model is implemented, and you can use the API to apply it to specific applications (predictive analytics, anomaly detection). But we are a <i>long</i> way off from the capability of applying it to &quot;general input.&quot;<p>The fact is, AI is not going to impress anyone until it can handle an equivalently general class of inputs to what a human can handle. And think about the inputs that humans receive. The five senses are just the beginning. They&#x27;re the <i>concrete</i> inputs we receive from the world. In addition to them, there&#x27;s a near infinite class of more abstract inputs that build on top of them. As humans, we interpret social cues, hormonal feedback, the emotions our body often inexplicably generates, and dozens of other &quot;second-order&quot; inputs that are derived from our fundamental sensory ones, but seem equally fundamental to us.<p>Ok, sure. Maybe you can model the brain, and maybe it can respond to inputs from its sensory environment. But those inputs are the absolute lowest building block of the totality of input into our brain. We have an entire subconscience dedicated to processing those fundamental sensory inputs, and generating derivative ones for our consciousness to process. The difficulty in AI, in 2014, is modeling that subconscience. How do we go from basic environmental input to its infinitely more complex derivatives? How do we build a subconscience that our current AI can interpret as an input of its own?<p>We are a long way off from this capability. Nobody is going to figure it out on their own, and neither is a company of a few dozen. To me, it seems incredibly wasteful to spend 30 years working on this product without revealing any of the journey. After all this time, what do you have to show for it? Basically nothing. Your AI can apparently complete tasks of a similar complexity to state of the art that&#x27;s been developed in less than a decade.<p>I want to see models, and I want the community to discuss them, problem solve with them, and build on them. Enough of this closed source, proprietary, snail&#x27;s pace AI development.<p>Software is constrained by computing limitations. Fundamentally, there can be no computational model that even approaches the complexity of a brain. At least not today. So why not forget about trying to build Skynet, and work with the community to further the field together?<p>[1] www.numenta.org",1404354864

7981148,comment,7977062,7981054,1,0,innguest,,,"There are answers to those questions but they do not help you to understand functional programming as a practice. Because you&#x27;re asking the equivalent of &quot;But how does OOP distinguish stack from heap from storage?&quot; and it&#x27;s not a practical question.<p>The answer is something along the lines of: the compiler is usually very different from most, it uses graph reduction and rewriting techniques, garbage collectors optimized for block reusage for all the heap churn that all those function frames <i>would</i> generate if implemented naively (that&#x27;s why recursion ends up being as fast as a loop); this is my cursory understanding of it. But yes, I would suggest Lisp in Small Pieces and Appel&#x27;s compiler books.<p>For practical purposes what is important is that FP is inviting you to program in this world where it is not important to talk about how those things end up getting implemented on the machine. In fact it lets you quickly escape that world whenever possible by allowing you to alias the String type to FirstName for instance; so you can talk about the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, and not the computer that will run it. That&#x27;s the point of declarative programming and FP is declarative.<p>It&#x27;s the same in Prolog, I&#x27;d think. I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t care about how these things are actually being created and destroyed on the machine; the power of Prolog&#x27;s declarative style is precisely that it allows you to never talk about the machine if you don&#x27;t want to. That ends up being more general than the usual abstractions of the day that still model themselves after the turing machine.<p>There&#x27;s no state to speak of. FP builds the blueprint of the program (one level removed from the way OOP and procedural see things) and gives it to the computer to run it. Now we make the execution order implicit (it&#x27;s now implicitly threaded through the functions&#x27; caller-callee relationships) and we lose the ability to do state (because state depends on ordering things, which can be represented by the semicolon in curly-brace languages). We also lose the ability to do one thing after the other. But although it sounds like a bad thing, it&#x27;s actually a really good thing, because apparently most bugs live inside semicolons.",1404354531

Acts and statutes are always interpreted by the letter, you are perhaps confusing this by making a comparison of these EU statutes with common law or jus commune as that is interpreted by &quot;the spirit of the law&quot; (usually informed by case-law, constitutions etc. depending on the country).<p>Acts and statutes are not common law (or natural law), and these EU measures are enabled by acts and statutes in each separate EU member state. So they are indeed interpreted to the letter as these acts must be implemented in states with codified constitutions (where one court has supreme interpretation of a constitution and must apply EU law with direct effect, although the big ones haven&#x27;t done this till recently) and ones without (where there is an indirect effect of law).

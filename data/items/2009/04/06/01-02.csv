I'm sure right now it's a bit stressful and probably overwhelming, not to mention getting spanked by the rejections is a bit of a blow to the ego... especially coming from somebody who sees themselves as <i>slowed down by my peers</i>...<p>Once you take that break, spend a good couple hours alone and not distracted to just write out (and I mean write, not think) what you really want out of your life for the next couple years.  You don't need to have concrete goals, but something as simple as ""I'd like to start my own software business before I graduate"" or ""I want to get involved with mathematics research projects"" are examples.  You seem like someone who is very driven, so I bet you'll have no problem with this.<p>Secondly, write down who you are and what are your values.  Are you the type of person that needs the structure of class to be motivated, or can you stay focused on your own?  How much personal time do you want?  Obviously a less demanding class-load gives you more time to work on your own projects.<p>Once you lay down the big picture of who you are as a person and your overall goals/purpose for the next few years, it's going to be 1000x easier to choose a college.  It's like finding the shoe that fits you best.<p>Finally, you'll find plenty of people who are smarter than you, even at a state school.  I knew many people ""smarter"" than myself when I went to a state school, yet I was the one who was making a 5 figure income by my senior year in college from my own business (as if money is the only thing that matters).  For the record, I was <i>only</i> a 1400 SAT.",1238983153

Heard of the WTO?<p>Anyway, I'm not proposing we submit all authority to the UN. One country One vote doesn't work, IMO. But One Trade Bloc One Vote is far more palatable.<p>The arguments you make against global police are generalisable to local police, too. Yes, corruption is a danger. With good governance this is manageable.<p><i>""What experience with supranationals supports that theory?""</i><p>The WTO, which has, as far as I can see, been a smashing success.<p>I don't really understand the rest of your points. ""Isolationism"" has not been practised by the USA for a century.<p>I would be a lot more persuaded by your points about an evil supranational if we didn't see so much evil perpetrated by mere nations all around us. You might fear the USA's wings being clipped, but everyone elses' would be as well. And a global body with real power and moral mandate could do real good. For example, it could have stopped Darfur. And, being disinterested in China's exports, it could constrain their misadventures in Tibet and Africa too.<p>Think ""WTO with morals"". Does that really sound so bad?",1238983124

However if you win a judgment against someone who has assets but refuses to pay, a court could order wage garnishments and even asset seizure. Basically the courts can make you pay by taking from you. (At least, this is how it works in the USA.)<p>Of course cases with citizens of different nationality are different and much more difficult to work with, even with a paper contract. Both governments must be willing to hold their citizen up to the agreement in the contract. If I have a contract (printed, signed, and notarized) between myself and the deposed king of Nigeria, it would be hard for me to take the ex-king to court.",1238983101

I could have taken an year off to prepare for the college entrance exams (college is a big deal in India, so we have too much competition) and got much better marks, but I chose to just join whichever college I could get into, reputation or no reputation. Now I regret it. My college is more like a 4-year crash course in getting a 9-to-5 job, my teachers care only about academic performance and my peers think I'm a nutjob. Not that it's a bad college, it's just that they don't really <i>get</i> education. You know, never attribute to malice that which can adequately be explained by stupidity.<p>The environment of your college matters. Your peers matter.

548101,comment,547938,547938,0,0,krschultz,,,"I was in your shoes as well, 2350 SATs, 40+ college credits, 4.0 GPA + all the standard extra curricular leadership/community service stuff + a few unique things like being on national radio & tv.<p>I didn't apply to any Ivy. I thought about MIT but decided not to apply because my brother went to a *IT and for a lot of reasons hated the whole ""only guys on campus in engineering degrees"" atmosphere.<p>I'll give you four reasons why a ""lesser"" school will wind up making you MUCH happier<p>1) Focus - those schools are not super focused on engineering. You are second fiddle to the business and humanities - always. That applies for all the Ivy's, tufts, amherst, (not sure about mcgill)<p>2) Legacy - based on the 10 or so people who went from my high school that I knew prior to my college choice, non were happy with their classmates. A lot of the kids who get into ivy are children of alumni, and thus are not as qualified as you are, so your classes are a lot weaker than you would expect.<p>3) Money - If you can get into one of those schools you can get a full ride at plenty of BETTER technical schools. I got a full ride+, meaning tuition, books, housing, to 5 of the top 20 schools in my major (mechanical engineering), and I only applied to 5.<p>4 (and most importantly)) If you really are smart and know your stuff. your undergraduate degree does not matter. One of two things will happen to you after college, you will successfully start your own business and your credentials won't matter, or you will get a graduate degree.<p>It seems to me that you have the list of the north eastern top 10 schools and applied to them without digging deeper into the list of colleges and finding the true engineering gems. Start with US news & world reports rankings for comp eng/comp sci or whatever you want, they are not perfect but they are a good place to start. Then visit them and decide for yourself. Setup private meetings with professors/deans. The group tours done by students are utterly useless. It doesn't matter what the dorms look like or how well manicured the lawns are. Ask if undergraduates are involved in research, what the study abroad programs are like, what areas the school's research focuses on, etc. Specific questions about the program.<p>For me I had a list of 5 schools that lined up and narrowed them down by program quality, and then focus. For example I liked Penn State's aerospace engineering program, but their focus was on propulsion at the time and I'm not very interested in that. Where as the school I go to now focuses on fuel cells and robotics, both of which interest me. Those are the questions to be asking, not whether people will recognize the name of your school on a resume.<p>Also I would say that you MUST go to a school on a school day, observing the interactions between students tells you all you need to know about the place. I went to one school over the summer and loved it, and then during the school year people looked so ""click""-y I didn't want to go there anymore.<p>The problem for you is this - transfer students are generally not offered scholarships. So you are a bit late to the party for applying and getting money. I would say nothing is as important as minimizing your college debt if you want to remain flexible to start a company. It might be worth applying scattershot to a bunch of schools before their deadlines and working it out later, or taking a half year off and do something to boost your resume and apply again. Normally I would say transfer but if you have a resume like that, you will get money else where so don't leave that on the table.<p>Sorry for the rambling but I'm between projects, good luck, email me if you have more questions. Just look back some day and say, the best thing that ever happened to me was getting rejected from the IVYs.",1238982864
548100,comment,547938,547938,0,0,tsally,,,"Meh.  I was similarly crushed when I was rejected from the Ivy league schools I thought I would be going to.  The most important thing to do is realize that most of it is ultimately irrelevant.  If your department is top 10,  the school wont make much of an impact past that point.  Once you're in a decent department the rest is up to you.<p>More importantly, you actually have no idea which one of these schools is a best fit for you.  My focus was Columbia in highschool.  You know what I realized now?  It would have been a horrible fit for me.  UIUC is pretty good culture wise (mostly because of the CS department) and it has far better Computer Science.  I didn't even apply to the school which I realize now would be the best fit (Berkeley).  But I had never even heard of Berkeley outside of the CS rankings because it's not an Ivy.<p>Recognizing that you have very little chance in correctly reading your own needs, try narrowing down the college by obvious criteria:<p>1.) Place yourself in a top 10 department in the subject you want to study.<p>2.) Make sure the campus culture is at least a decent fit for you (i.e., don't go to a big 10 school if you have an aversion to sports and partying.  I personally think the hardcore party people here are jokes, but I have no problem dealing or even being friends with them.).<p>3.) Minimize the amount of money it takes you to get there.  Only make a concession if your upgrading yourself from a bottom half of the top 10 to a number 1.<p>4.) Make sure the campus is a place where you see yourself living for four years.<p>Academics + Culture + Minimal Money + Location.  It really is that simple.  I doubt more than one of the colleges on your list fits into the above criteria.<p>EDIT: Also, don't beat yourself up over not getting in.  It's essentially a coin flip when it comes down to it.  I thought I had a pretty kickass profile too, but there you go.  As PG has written, it's not in the best interest of the admissions committee to spend the time picking the exact best candidates.  And believe me, this type of rejection will keep happening.  I just got rejected from a NASA scholarship I thought I had a pretty good shot at.  In the rejection email, they suggested if I reapplied to improve on pretty much every aspect of my application!  I know my app was better than that.  Like I said.. meh. :)",1238982840

Admissions committees look for someone that'll add diversity to the campus - not just racial diversity, but diversity of interests too.<p>I went to Amherst (College, not UMass).  Something like 1 in 8 of my admitted class had a 4.0 and 1 in 10 had perfect SATs, but we all had something <i>else</i> besides that.  Like my astro-major dormmate who was also a nationally-ranked scrabble player.  Or my friend who'd been left for dead at age 10 in Liberia, and had started his own organization dedicated to eradicating child soldiers.  I'd worked in an all-teenage dot-com in my gap year before college, too.<p>Anyway, here's my somewhat heretical advice:<p>Don't go to college - yet.  Instead, if you're really set on tech entrepreneurship, take a year off and found a startup.  Take it as far as you can - pick out a market, talk to people in that market, try to design and build a product that satisfies that market.<p>If you succeed, great - you don't need college.  You can always pull a Woz and go back anyway.  But even if you fail, it'll teach you lots about what you <i>really</i> want to do.  It may not be what you think now.  One of my biggest regrets is that I basically planned my college career based on what I thought I wanted to do in my last year of high school, completely ignoring the lessons from my gap year.  I could've saved myself a lot of aggravation and made my college experience a lot more meaningful had I adjusted my plans for where I wanted to go and what I wanted to study based on my experience working in a tech startup.<p>And if you fail - great.  You'll look so much better to colleges for having given it a shot.  Maybe you'll even get into Stanford or MIT next time around.",1238982397

First off, it's truly an amazing place.  Kids here are brilliant and Yale will give you money to do absolutely anything you're interested in.  All you have to do is ask.  There's also the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute, an incubator for student ventures.  Think of it as a Y Combinator for Yale students; you get a 5K stipend to spend the summer in New Haven, work on your project and attend workshops.<p>With that said, there are a few things you should be aware of.  Yale is obviously not known for its science or engineering focus but among many students there's actually a contempt for any subject involving numbers.  Most of my friends fulfilled their math requirement with ridiculous classes like ""The Pleasures of Counting"" or ""Geometry of Nature.""  I am not even joking.<p>As a science student I sometimes feel like a second class citizen.  Science/Engineering classes tend to meet earlier than usual and on Fridays.  The buildings are all on Science Hill which is a 10-15 minute walk from central campus.  This isn't a huge deal until December when New Haven turns into an icy hellscape for three months.<p>Finally, as far as entrepreneurship goes, you'll find a lot of kids here who would be interested in co-founding a venture.  The only problem is most of them don't have the technical background to put their money where their mouth is.<p>I'd be glad to talk to you more about this or answer specific questions.

Some of the methods are surprisingly quantitative and all of them are procedural.  Indeed, many techniques of criticism grew of the the fact that English Professors at universities in the 20th century had no formal method of research, while the counterparts in fields like Chemistry had no problem justifying their existence.  I might be more precise in my words above by saying Literary Criticism instead of English.<p>I agree with you that the direct benefit of these disciplines is not entirely clear; must research needs to be done in this area.  One thing that is clear, however, is that the undergraduate CS curriculum is not particularly good at teaching this way of thinking.  The closest you can come to achieving the effect of English and Philosophy on your thinking is a well designed CS curriculum focused on theory.  I've found that the students here who find theory interesting also tend to be good programmers.

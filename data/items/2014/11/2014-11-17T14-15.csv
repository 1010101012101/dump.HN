The only downside (which, admittedly, is very, very big) is that the PyPy developers released their own FFI library for interfacing with C-code (which works brilliantly), but using c-types and the c-python c-api is very kludgy.  This means that a lot of very important python libraries which are basically thin wrappers around c/fortran code (SciPy, NumPy, etc) are not really working.<p>There is some effort around reimplementing NumPy in PyPy, but it&#x27;s going very slowly.<p>Edit:
PyPy is also a heroic effort by a small team of developers who receive some donations.  JS is probably the language that received the most amount of money and attention into making it run fast from Google/Mozilla, etc - in terms of results/money, PyPy is incredible.",1416236160

The question is how much effort is the NSA putting into crypto research vs. the academic community as a whole, and I imagine we don&#x27;t have a good way to answer that question. Even raw dollars wouldn&#x27;t necessarily tell the whole story, since the NSA cryptographers probably have an easier time working together on focused tasks, which both lead to more progress on said tasks while at the same time potentially leaving entirely unresearched areas if groupthink/consensus/management says there&#x27;s no point to researching something. (I would imagine management uses a relatively light touch if a researcher asserts that something needs to be dug into, but groupthink is a inevitable.) Consequently characterization of where they are ahead and potentially where they may even be behind is probably a bit difficult, since the situation is in reality probably very complex and unknowable to anyone outside the NSA.",1416236139

But if you don&#x27;t pursue wombs enough, your genes and your attitude will not make it into the next generation. That is not a tragedy, but it results in men valuing wombs being the majority.<p>Again, this is more naturalistic fallacy nonsense. The objective facts about our evolutionary history do not in any way justify behaviors for conscious individuals. Evolutionarily, I am driven to feed myself when hungry, but if I steal somebody&#x27;s food, that&#x27;s still a crime. Evolutionarily I have a predisposition to violence, but if I hurt or kill somebody, that&#x27;s still wrong. The evolutionary history provides historical reasons for the systemic oppression of women, but it does not justify it. It is still wrong, and it should still be fought in the same way that theft, assault, and murder are wrong.<p>> Well you haven&#x27;t convinced me of your authority.<p>So? That&#x27;s entitled bullshit. I don&#x27;t have to explain things to you until you&#x27;re convinced.

To the extent that pushes people out of the work force (i.e. companies choose to not hire certain marginally-qualified workers rather than give them better shifts), expand welfare to cover those people.<p>This is a politically untenable solution here in the U.S. because even our economic liberals aren&#x27;t liberal enough to be comfortable with telling Wal-Mart that there is no reason to have stores open 24-hours a day.",1416235892

The TOYGRIPPE database is a “repository of VPN endpoints”14 that is used by targeting officers to determine if that computer should be a target for further exploitation 13. The TURMOIL VPN module also looks up the IP information in a database called KEYCARD to determine if the target should be tasked for targeted SIGINT collection or to recover the VPN key. Of special note is that this VPN traffic passes through a system called “TE-VPN PIQ Blade.” PIQ refers to the PICARESQUE ECI marking 38, which is associated with BULLRUN 16. The BULLRUN program is NSA’s effort to weaken and exploit encryption that protects digial SIGINT, whether by finding bugs in cryptographic algorithms or by manipulating standards bodies or companies into weakening encryption tools.

But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s enough to keep systemd out of Debian. And the way things are going, nothing will.<p>Debian is an operating system, but the amount of code that comes from people actually part of the Debian project is very, very small in comparison to the amount of code that comes from upstream projects. Some of those projects have people on them who are involved in Debian, many do not. In a growing number of cases, those upstreams are starting to rely on functionality that systemd provides, partly because it&#x27;s becoming common to have systemd available on Linux systems, partly because it&#x27;s providing functionality that nobody else is (like logind replacing the aged and unmaintained ConsoleKit[1]).<p>So if upstream packages are going to rely upon systemd, what is Debian to do? They have a limited set of options. They are:<p>1) Ship the packages the way the upstream built them -- dependent on logind, for instance. Ship any systemd compatability shims that exist for people who want to make a go of it without systemd.
2) Stop shipping packages that require systemd, or rewrite parts of thost packages until they don&#x27;t anymore.<p>The problem is that a lot of volunteers who maintain packages for Debian are convinced that number one is the best -- it&#x27;s the least effort for them, and provides the best user experience for anyone on systemd. People who want to keep systemd out of Debian are pushing for number two, and they&#x27;re trying to do it politically -- in other words, force maintainers to behave how they want to. In a volunteer project, that&#x27;s rather dicey.<p>But there&#x27;s really no avoiding it -- if the TC had decided against systemd as the default init, GNOME would still depend on logind, and there&#x27;s still be a fight over who had to do the work to get GNOME running without systemd.<p>(This is also why I&#x27;m really annoyed at people who keep screaming that Linux is about choice -- yes, but it&#x27;s not about coerced choice. Your choice not to use systemd doesn&#x27;t mean you get to force others to work on code to support your choice.)<p>[1] Yes, someone forked ConsoleKit into ConsoleKit2. That happened about a month ago, way past the point where all this debate started, and probably past the point where most packages are going to care.",1416235237

Before jumping on, I bounced from the promise of Linux distro to FreeBSD, to OpenBSD -- trying to find something that worked as a desktop environment. Once OS X was released, I knew I found what I had been looking for. It definitely wasn&#x27;t because it was from Apple (back then, using Apple was being counterculture, if not somewhat risky as the business wasn&#x27;t doing so well); it was because there was finally a desktop OS that had a POSIX layer and a GUI that didn&#x27;t feel like a third arm grafted on to /usr/local/whatever.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that MS catches the drift that DOS is dead & can kill that sacred cow; I&#x27;d love to get a Surface tablet & develop for Windows Phone, but having to deal with DOS is like moving out of a house and trying to live in a tent. My experiences with Powershell haven&#x27;t been all that much better.

There is also an undercurrent of those who actually understand this simple fact not saying much, because &quot;everyone knows&quot; that you get 50 states into a big pile, anything you say about them can and will be wrong in some minor detail in one state and your entire argument will be viciously attacked because being only 98% right is the same as 0% right.<p>There is also at least a three step game being played where the first step is &quot;demand ID to vote&quot; rather than the existing &quot;we trust you&quot; system.  The second step is state ID is technically free if you have the documentation required.  The third step is making the documentation required change annually and sometimes be very expensive, almost impossible to obtain and you can always blame the victim for not having all the right paperwork.<p>My wife doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;real id&quot; because it would just cost too much and be too much of a PITA to fix, so when a &quot;real id&quot; level license is required to vote, she&#x27;ll be disenfranchised from voting.

Politically more important figures had to be drawn larger than everyone else, with their heads placed higher, regardless of their more realistic height and position in the scene. Being often used as sort of religious picture books, the depth dimension is present, but often used to depict passage of time, not distance from the viewer. And for a period of time, it was considered sinful to try to &quot;compete with God&quot; by making things look more realistic.<p>And like modern software projects, the artists had to work with the employees they could find and train on their own.

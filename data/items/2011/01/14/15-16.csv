He seemingly screwed over a couple people along the way taking the idea and running with it (breach of contract, unethical etc, even if you are doing all the work). But at this point Facebook has made all of those people incredibly wealthy through settlements of cash and even people owning sharers. Those people will only get more wealthy when they IPO.<p>Do they really think they could have made more money if Mark hadn't walked out on them and run built it all himself? You have $150 million dollars now, could you have made a billion dollar business? The idea behind Facebook was not all that unique. Certainly it was bad that he walked out on them and stole it, but would they have built a $50 billion company?<p>Just based on how they have acted since getting the settlement, I think not. You have $150 million now, that is enough money to fund 15 new ventures without ever going to a VC.<p>If these guys thought they could make more money than Zuckerburg without him, then DO IT. You can try 15 times before you are broke. That is a luxury almost none of the rest of us have.<p>Instead by constantly going back to the golden goose and trying to get money they are proving their inability to build a business. Facebook was a lottery win for them and they have no ability to do better.

This goal isn't any less important when an inflexible typesetting environment forces you to use a narrow range of discreet units.<p>I've edited too many documents to count, but in nearly all cases, it was a default software setting that inserted extra space after a period, before the next sentence.

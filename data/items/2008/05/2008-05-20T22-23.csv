195423,story,,,70,112,notdarkyet,"Ask YC: Django vs Ruby on Rails",,"I have recently finished the design work for a project I am going to be working on this summer and I was having a hard time deciding which framework to implement the project in.  A lot of the articles written out there seem to either be dated (so some of the qualms may have been changed in newer versions) or biased.  I have no experience in Python or Ruby, so I am completely open to either, I just want to make sure the investment in the time spent learning is worth it not just for this project but also for future ones (and for potential jobs).  I also am curious as to which hosting service you all use and how easy it is to implement that framework with it.  I had bought my domain name with GoDaddy.com along time ago, but I am open to switching to something reliable (and cheap I am still a student). Thanks for any input!<p>EDIT (To elaborate a little on my project, without giving details):<p>The project is relatively simple and provides a service to an area for a small fee.  For now, the area would be specific to one geographic location.  As the site grows and progresses, the site will need to scale by adding more locations (organized similar to how craiglist is specific to each location).",1211324168

The windows implementation of ANSI C89 rand() was done with a 16 bit linear congruential generator back in the win16 days, and left unchanged for compatibility reasons.  It's really not an insane choice on their part.  Lots of applications really do rely on PRNG repeatability, and you wouldn't want a platform upgrade to interfere with that.<p>The real lesson is that applications with solid randomness requirements need to be relying on their own generators (there are lots to choose from) or an OS-supplied RNG (e.g. /dev/urandom) and not ANSI C, which is underspecified.",1211323110

If your bot is breaking even at a raked table, and you remove the rake, it would become a winning player. Far more so, in fact, than it makes just taking 35% of the rake back.",1211322612

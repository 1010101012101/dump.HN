I'm not speaking for OLPC right now.<p>> The development community know all about this and are scathing of it.<p>People taking Approach A often think that the people taking Approach B are foolish and misguided (else they'd work on it themselves); it's not a point that carries normative weight by itself.  We have to actually look at the arguments.<p>> a) these tablets are vastly more expensive than just hiring teachers locally - by orders of magnitude.<p>Well, steady.  The two villages we chose are entirely illiterate -- they have no literate adults, and no-one there has ever been to school.  One of the villages has potential access to one school that's 10 miles away and 3000 feet lower, which is not a plausible trip.<p>So now you've signed up to build two schools, and then find literate teachers who want to live in or spend all of their working time teaching in a remote illiterate village.  And you realize that Oromo is highly dialectal, such that the two villages in this case speak dialects that aren't comprehensible to each other; your teacher probably doesn't know their dialect already.  Is it still orders of magnitude cheaper than tablets?<p>> b) More perniciously, the tablets educate in English or Amharic: not in the local language of the population in question, which these children would otherwise speak; their parents are often not fluent in either.<p>There are no Oromo applications of any kind for Android, so in effect you're saying that this experiment should simply not happen, and these kids should not get to use technology.  I don't agree with that.<p>Even if it's successfully argued that teachers are a better solution for Ethiopia -- I certainly agree that a small class size and a brilliant teacher is a wonderful thing when it's available -- there are a hundred million kids in the world with no access to a school.  That seems worth researching a potential amelioration for, right?<p>Maybe you're missing that this is a pilot-stage experiment that only involved 40 children?

4725419,comment,4722300,4724599,1,0,unconed,,,"The problem with gradient meshes is that they are 2D grids that run all the way through the shape. Thus you can't add control points on one side of your mesh without adding a bunch of useless ones across the whole length or width. Each mesh segment has to be a 4-sided bezier patch. If you try to gradient mesh a curved shape, the mesh lines run at very awkward angles, it's often better to start straight and bend it only after subdivision. Diffusion curves solve all of these problems, and seem to have no obvious downsides.<p>I don't see how they would match the artist's intention any less, quite the opposite. You can alter any small part of the image without compromising the overall structure, and you can control spline tension through the blur radius. The only thing I would say is missing is the ability to skew the blur to be more intense on one side of the diffusion curve, thus creating asymmetrical gradients.<p>In tools like Illustrator gradient meshes are flattened to images anyway when exported to PDF. So if a technique like this was implemented, it wouldn't change the workflow at all. In fact, I expect to see this in Illustrator in the next two versions.",1351726582

I look forward to the future messages delivered to my account, no@piss-off.com. I also realize that my argument would have been wrong.)<p>If Maneesh has been building fame and fortune online by using SEO tools to come up with subjects that $.01/word writers at <a href=""http://thecontentauthority.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thecontentauthority.com/</a> will blog about for him (it's ""high quality"" and ""not spam"", of course) and then post around the web for him so that he can make passive AdSense revenue from people directed to the ghost-written posts by Google, well ... awesome, I guess. I honestly kind of wish I could give up programming and do something like that; I certainly can't argue with his quality of life or how he's chosen to spend the money he's made exploiting a company that provides both ads and search results.<p>And if he's now coming up with ways to leverage his skills into enormously popular posts like, ""How I quadrupled my productivity by hiring a hiring a woman to slap me"", or, ""How to learn a language in 90 days"", or, ""How to Earn $12,840 from a Single Guest Post"", then that's awesome too, I guess.<p>And if he then writes a post that compiles a bunch of tips on building a social-media-newsletter-marketing-recurring-revenue business, then awesome, too. But, I find myself agreeing with handzhiev's sentiment that it's vague and incomplete and not polished, and I also find myself feeling like I should soon expect to see a follow-up post, ""How I made $32,768 by having someone else write a guest post on my site and submit it everywhere"", followed by the even more popular, ""The ultimate guide to getting rich online"".",1351724942

4725324,comment,4718415,4721623,1,0,RShiki,,,"""Linux kills everything that cannot differentiate.""<p>Yeah, and Windows differentiated by offering an insane level of backward compatibility which makes both developers happy (they don't have to maintain and patch their apps as much) and users who don't have to lose their favorite piece of software, which is why Linux has never overtaken the desktop. Windows runs the apps people want : MS Office, Photoshop... the mac also runs some of those but you can see how fickle backward compatibility is with Apple. You can install Windows 8 on the early macintels, you can't install Mac OS X Mountain Lion on those. MS offers better support for older Apple hardware than Apple themselves.<p>Apple is not going to survive android on the long term unless they truly manage to turn the iPhone into a fashion statement and multiply their effort to make it look like jewelry. Apple revenue depends entirely on the iPad and iPhone nowadays, Mac aren't making them any money. Unlike Windows, people don't have any sort of long term, or big in $ investment in mobile software. Transitioning from iOS to Android is not like going from Windows to Linux and losing Office, Photoshop, thousands of dollars worth of a game library built over a decade..",1351724823

4725313,comment,4724400,4724400,1,0,raju,,,"Website looks good (Still waiting on your email - No worries though)<p>A couple of things spring to mind which other HN'ers have addressed, but I will put my thoughts down regardless<p>1. Having an iPhone app is great - given the fact that you can take pictures, log your location - but for a large part of my day, I have a full blown keyboard and a 25"" screen - and not being able to use that to jot down thoughts defeats the purpose. Everyday.me and Day One get this right (although they both have issues that I will highlight next). Case in point - I need a client on the desktop. Momento, the app that I have been using for close to 2 years now sucks at this, but they get almost everything else right.<p>2. With regards to having a client, perhaps an API would be nice - one that someone can run with to build a desktop client. I have no issues using a web interface, but Day One gets this right - a rich client, a keystroke away to capture something really quickly. Furthermore, it gives me the ability to post longer - like an end-of-the-day entry covering how I felt, and how I thought the day went<p>3. Export - I want my entries out of the system. Momento (my current journalling app of choice) gets this right. They give you ways to back up your entire journal, and a way to export your entries as plain text. This is my current issue with Everyday.me (I know they allow you to export entries now, but it's only specific ones - No bulk export capability)<p>4. Security - This is the reason I stopped using OhLife - I still post once in a while, but all my truly personal thoughts go in Momento. You mentioned that you already have Dropbox integration on your list, and that would certainly be nice. That does not mean I will not post to blobly but I need to know that security is a top priority.<p>5. Tags and potentially Address book integration - Momento gets this right, to some extent - But tags not only help search better, they provide (at least to me) some context to ""group"" things together.<p>6. Multiple photos per entry - Momento gets this right, Day One not so much.<p>7. Integration with other social networking sites - Twitter/Facebook at a minimum. Momento gets this right. Another one is the potential to hook into an RSS feed (Momento does this)<p>7a. (Addendum to point no. 7) Here's my approach to it - I export my phone entries, text messages, photos, momento entries, and calendar entries every month. I am working on a script that ""stitches"" together all this information to give me a full view of what my day looked like. I think for most this would be a little extreme, but getting close to it would be nice :)<p>With all that said, let me say that your app looks gorgeous, and I can't wait to give it a spin on my phone (once I get my invite :D) - I would love to have a one-stop full featured journaling app on my phone (and desktop). I wish you well - and you can be certain you will be getting some feedback from me - and something tells me, even some money :)<p>Good luck.",1351724532

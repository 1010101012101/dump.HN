The local governments are speeding up the permit process, but it's going to take a long time to catch up.

4120990,comment,4110480,4117129,1,0,soc88,,,"Well, I guess will have to agree to disagree here.<p>From my perspective Scala solves a lot of problems with Haskell:<p>- Working module system (From my experience, especially people coming from OO languages are surprised that this is such a huge unsolved problem in Haskell, because all the languages they know have come up with a working solution.) It will be interesting if some OCaml-style module system as currently discussed makes it into Haskell.<p>- It is much easier to reason about space consumption.<p>- It benefits from the best general-purpose VM with its superior garbage collection algorithms. (I agree that the lack of VM features is deeply annoying.)<p>- Tons of tools for monitoring.<p>- Debuggers. I'm not certain that Haskell will ever have decent debugging capabilities, taking its approach to laziness and compilation into account.<p>- Exceptions which don't leave the developer wondering where exactly an error has occurred. (Stack-traces, anyone?)<p>- Libraries for basically everything. Even if you don't use them, you can have a look at how other developers have approached a certain problem.<p>- Tool support. The Scala IDE alone has 10 people working on it. Compare it to Leksah and EclipseFP.<p>- Commercial support. Scala has Typesafe (> 30 people) and dozens of partners, consultancies, etc. In Haskell, there is Well-Typed, which is more or less payed by the Industrial Haskell Group (which consists of Galois and Amgen).<p>- The REPL is just a lot more usable.<p>I don't have any problems with the compile time. When developing in Eclipse there is just no delay between pressing Run and the execution of the program. It is instantaneous.<p>Syntax ... well, that's a completely subjective topic.<p>terrible dependency/package/module management ... SBT delivers a top-notch experience here. Have dependencies as source on sites like GitHub? SBT will fetch and build them without problems. Need to deploy artifacts into the local repo, to Maven Central or other services? SBT will happily do that. Need to cross-compile to different versions? Easy. Want to build software for Android? SBT will compile, jar, proguard, dex and install it on your device in seconds. I would love to hear what you would like to see here!<p>semantically an inferior language: Well, I guess every language is inferior to Haskell. I appreciate the hard work done in Haskell to track side-effects and other things. While I don't think these exact approaches will ever see much adoption, it leads the way to more manageable approaches. I'm pretty sure computer science will come up with some great solution in the next decade and Haskell will play its part here.<p>less powerful language: Well, it depends on what you mean with Haskell. Haskell == the Haskell standard? Scala is a lot more powerful than that. Haskell == GHC with all its proprietary extensions enabled: Yes, probably.<p>I don't think Go is really comparable with Scala or Haskell. It feels a bit like it was designed in an ivory tower. It is certainly a nice language if you ignored the last 20 years of progress in language design and have never used anything except C.<p>Let me know what you think and if I missed something!",1339864943

4120971,comment,4118371,4120821,2,0,stiff,,,"Have you ever designed a web page from scratch?<p>Let's assume I also decided to design a site with the same core layout - a bar on the top with the logo and the menu, content on the bottom, that's not unusual as you point out, but already a coincidence. However, I have to decide on the height of the top bar - is any value between 40 and 60 objectively better than all the other ones so that everyone deciding on this kind of design would settle on the same one? Next step, I decide on a drop shadow below the top bar, again a reasonable coincidence. Again however, a graphic program will typically require to specify the color, the opacity and the radius of the shadow with thousands of combinations possible that look almost the same aesthetically so there is no reason people would pick one over another very often. Then you decide for the color of the highlight of the button, again, there are hundreds of colors that give almost the same effect visually but they ""picked"" _exactly_ the same one. It's the same with many other small nuances, font size, line height, border color, link color etc.<p>Even if there would be just 10 rational choices in each step, with 20 steps (both values way underestimated) that's already 10* *20 possible combinations. If you create a design in a space of a 20 dimensions and a total of 10 trillions of possibilities having differences in say 3 of the dimensions cannot serve as a defence. Hence almost always when people bring this argument up a closer examination shows little signs of plain old copy-paste beyond any reasonable doubt, just like the example with google analytics people point out below.",1339864611

But using the argument of 'size in terms of global finance' would surely render most currencies other than say USD, the Euro and a couple of Asian currencies as 'not popular', wouldn't it?<p>To be honest, I look at the total above of $54M and think ""transactions over 24 hours worth $22M for a currency whose entire value is $54M... that seems liquid at least"" (for my pathetic understanding of economics). To me, it seems as though there is a lot of activity within the currency itself, which to me says its popular in the circles that use it.

She painted his crease patterns, well-recognizable, with one or two changes that my eye parses as annoyingly illegal.<p>If you're not into origami, you may think a crease pattern is just an unintended byproduct -- what you happen to get when you unfold a model.  This isn't the case, as the article explains.  These things are carefully designed, and are the heart of the engineering process.  Models in books or on display sometimes come with diagrams of the pattern.  Receiving a model as a gift, one may very well unfold it flat to look at the crease pattern and see how it was done.<p>So I guess this is sort of like finding a pretty geometric pattern in someone's source code (that they put there!), and painting it.<p>I think it's too much of a shortcut to just take his crease patterns without attribution.  She's an artist; she can learn the art and make her own.  It's not as though it's a unique insight on her part that the useful patterns are beautiful in an abstract, geometric way.  We (origami enthusiasts) all think they are.  The paintings are beautiful and intriguing, but the art that makes them so isn't hers; it's Lang's.<p>I'm all for remixing and free information, but . . . I think at a minimum, attribution would be polite.",1339862607

1642297,comment,1641462,1642183,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"OK, I really don't know how to help you now using this medium.  You claim to have watching the Khan Academy video, but this question is answered in that.<p>The simple rules are these:<p><pre><code>    log(a.b) = log(a) + log(b)\n\n  hence\n\n    log(a^4) = log(a.a.a.a) = log(a)+log(a)+log(a)+log(a) = 4.log(a)\n\n  Therefore\n\n    if  a = b^z\n    then log(a) = log(b^z)\n    so   log(a) = z.log(b)\n</code></pre>\nThis is true for all bases.  Then we have<p><pre><code>    log_b(b) = 1  :  Log (base b) of b is 1.\n\n    Hence log_b(b^2) = 2\n          log_b(b^3) = 3\n\n    and so on.\n</code></pre>\nIn all this the basic rule is this:<p><pre><code>    if   x = b^y\n    then log_b(x) = log_b(b^y)\n                  = y.log_b(b)\n                  = y\n</code></pre>\nSo if the base is 10, then we have:<p><pre><code>    If  a = 10^b\n    then log(a) = log(10^b)\n                = b.log(10)\n                = b.1\n                = b\n</code></pre>\nSo now, start with the equation t=log(u), assuming the log is base 10, and use the above rules to change it around.  When you do that, see if you can get to saying u equals something.<p>Finally, you need to study sections 1, 2 and 3 of this page:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm</a><p>What's on that page will also help you to understand the questions.",1283025460

This is the beginning of where Hanzi and Kanji start to show their relative superiority (in some areas).<p>While Roman alphabets are phonetic, they have the trade-off that people with differing dialects cannot communicate. There is no 'Roman' language, there are dozens of European languages, learning all of them would be harder than learning one set of glyphs.<p>Similarly, because Hanzi and Kanji implies visual meaning, rather than being attached to sounds phonetically, they are more suited to communication methods like texting and email, where it's easier to discern meaning even if you don't know a word per se, and where phonetics don't matter at all. That native speakers often forget how to write words is testament to the effectiveness of 'spellcheck', and its reliability, reducing the need to memorize.<p>TL;DR The big downside to Kanji is the 'spelling', but with the advent of computers that probably will never be a problem ever again. Rather people who use these languages will be able to take advantage of their plus sides, including concision, visual meaning, and lack of phonetic dependence.<p>PS: The memorize ____ words to read a newspaper problem is way overblown, you'll still need to memorize ____ words in any alphabetical language too, and it's no easier than the asian languages.",1283024535

1642253,comment,1641996,1641996,0,0,mkn,,,"Well, it's on the front page, so I guess <i>someone</i> is taking this seriously.<p>This is not anywhere near a correct description of a sonic boom. A sonic boom is not ""a large burst when [an object] “breaks the sound barrier”."" It <i>is</i> a phenomenon that is associated with any object traveling at or above the speed of sound. A related phenomenon governs the crack of a whip, but is associated with unsteady flow around a <i>subsonic</i> object. (Yes, you read that right. The business end of a bullwhip does not need to travel faster than the speed of sound to produce an audible crack.)<p>What <i>really</i> happens in a sonic boom is, for a slender body traveling above the speed of sound, the local flow is turned ""suddenly,"" and the freestream is not able to accommodate it in a continuous fashion. There then arises an oblique shock wave, a very small region where fluid properties change nearly instantaneously; Direction, temperature, pressure, and entropy all change. Because the change is not isentropic, there is a hard lower limit to parasitic drag associated with supersonic motion through a fluid.<p>Interestingly, there is an expansion fan at the widest part of, for example, an aircraft body that is isentropic. It's a broad region where temperature, pressure, and direction change gradually. Thus, there are three 'sonic booms' when an aircraft passes overhead at a speed greater than the speed of sound. There is one sharp one as the nose passes you, due to a compression shock, and another softer one as the widest part passes you, due to an expansion fan, and a third one as the tail passes you, due to another compression shock. This is analogous to Mach diamonds in a rocket exhaust stream.<p>This is all for sufficiently lax definitions of ""passing you,"" as the shock and expansion fans propagate at the local Mach angle. You'll be looking downstream at the local Mach angle when you hear the boom, if you're following the craft with your eyes.",1283023982

We don't keep track. But I know there haven't been any with founders in their 50s, and only 2 or 3 with founders in their 40s or their teens. Most founders are in their 20s or 30s. Completely guessing, I'd say 15-20% have founders in their 30s.<p>[...other posts and questions...]<p>10 points by pg<p>Off the top of my head, I'd say that older founders are more likely to succeed. They don't give up so easily. On the other hand, they also tend to have much higher burn rates, which make their startups easier for circumstances to kill.<p>====== END QUOTE<p>So, pg is essentially saying that 75-80% of YC's investment goes to founders in their 20s. But he also acknowledges that older founders are more likely to succeed.<p>I can see multiple possible reasons for this strategy...for example, if you are doing social investing, you might assume that older workers are already established and relatively safe, but those just starting out could use a hand.  Or perhaps you care more about disruptive companies than successful ones and you feel that, although older founders may be successful more often, they will be disruptive less often.  If, however, your goal is simply to make money, then it seems like you should be investing disproportionately in older founders.<p>So, what's the reasoning for your investment strategy?",1283023486

Maybe programming really is a young person's game.<p>You don't see a lot of startups full of old programmers dominating their fields.  You don't see a lot of old programmers creating awesome open source projects.  Not even from those who retired and have plenty of time on their hands.  Many of the programmers who created great things 30 years ago are in positions to name their projects now, but what they've achieved since is less than when they were young and limited.  Math and physics (the fields generally most like cs) show the same pattern: throughout history, most great work done by people under 40.  None of this can be attributed to discrimination.<p>Certainly old coders feel as sharp as ever, with knowledge and experience tacked on.  But how one feels is a poor measure of anything.

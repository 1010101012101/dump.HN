3255607,comment,3255131,3255578,5,0,_delirium,,,"> It's called being a complete cunt to your fellow human beings<p>I can certainly agree that the policeman in question fits that description. But I'm sure he was ""just following orders"", which included the <i>very</i> urgent task of clearing some random sidewalk in a park. Although <i>who</i> is the bigger piece of shit depends in part on whether he was indeed ordered to do it, or was simply a poorly trained hothead acting without authorization (the police are sadly not empty of of power-hungry assholes who will use any excuse to ""teach people a lesson"", though I don't think such bad apples are quite as common as some people allege).<p>Frankly, I'm sick of people such as yourself cheerleading violence against people you don't like, WWF-style, because you're fighting some sort of culture war against the imagined enemy of hippiedom, and feel that you can use any means necessary to fight it, including violent ones. That sort of playground bullshit is to be expected in kids, but you're grown up, so what's your excuse for not applying some rational analysis to the pros/cons of using violence?<p>Actually, in the kid example, I blame the kid who punched there too. Poor impulse control isn't a justification for violence, and kids like that, if that behavior isn't fixed, often grow up to be violent adults who get ""provoked"" into fights, justifying it, just like the kid, by blaming someone else for ""forcing"" them to throw a punch in the bar.",1321721674

That said, this rule caused all sorts of problems - because debts had to be forgiven on a regular basis, no one would lend to the poor at all.<p>In the first century BCE, Rabbi Hillel came up with a novel solution - the creditor 'sold' the debt to a rabbinical court, who didn't have to cancel it since (I believe - memory's a little hazy here) the letter of the law referred to individuals. The court in turn gave the creditor power-of-attorney to collect the debt at any time and the right to all the proceeds. Problem solved.<p>The mishnah (a codification of Jewish oral tradition) on this part of the Torah and Hillel's reinterpretation of it is really interesting - the rabbis aren't stupid, and they can see that Hillel's playing fast and loose with the original intent of the law, but write that it was necessary in order to 'repair the world'.<p>This wouldn't be the last time something designed to protect or help the poor completely backfired due to unforseen circumstances.",1321721605
3255605,comment,3246092,3246092,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"The article is pushing, pushing HARD, on a particular point of view:  ""Sex is normal and okay and should be enjoyed well before marriage and age 18"".<p>Well, in the US in this year 2011, heavily this point of view is in actual fact DANGEROUS.<p>Before explaining some of the danger, notice, the article is EXTREME:  To see how extreme, just look at the picture where the girl is somewhere between age 9-12, my guess would be 10 or 11.  Below I will illustrate a little of why 9-12 is, here in the US in 2011, so extreme.<p>We need a fact of life, mostly about politics and religion and not just about sex:  In the US, there is an extremely strongly held and very restrictive norm and a significant fraction of the population that believes very strongly in this norm and wants very much to have this norm ENFORCED on others and to bring serious, severe, even lifetime, public retribution to anyone who violates that norm.  The norm is close to the traditional teachings of some religions, especially Roman Catholics, Baptists, Orthodox Jews, and Muslims, that sex should be ONLY within marriage.  The idea that sex should be 'fun' between two people, like, say, playing tennis, is frowned on.  That's the norm.  To enforce the norm, there can be various cases of 'religious police'.<p>Now on to the danger:  Anyone in the US who is publicly accused of violating the norm can be in very deep trouble in their job or marriage or legally.<p>E.g., without a doubt, one of the greatest dangers to the career of a politician is an accusation that they violated the norm.  That is, there is a long list of once powerful politicians who, just because of accusations that they 'fooled around', were thrown out of office or had their political careers seriously hurt.  Forgot Governor Spitzer?  What about Chairman Wilbur Mills?  The Little Wiener Representative Weiner?  The news media is talking more about Herman Cain's (A) 999 plan or (B) he said-she said?<p>Outside of politics, there is a great danger of a person being accused of being a 'sexual predator' and, thus, having to 'register' for the rest of their life.<p>Violations of the norm can be taken more seriously than robbery or even murder.  I.e., some people who follow the norm are REALLY 'uptight' about sex.<p>There are so many people who believe strongly in the norm, especially in Texas and the Bible Belt, that the Republicans toss out little hints about abstinence-only sex education, leaving sex education to the parents and holding down any role in sex education in the schools, repealing Roe v. Wade, etc. and get some significant election advantage.<p>Any suggestion or hint of improper behavior about sex at work can result in law suits, being fired, etc.<p>One of the crimes taken most seriously is rape, but, if sex were just like a game of tennis, then why lock people up for years because of rape?  Because according to the norm, sex is very much NOT just like a game of tennis.<p>If the boy is in college and the girl in high school, then have to do some careful calculations about their birth dates and state laws to decide if the boy should be locked up.<p>Heck, the people with the norms don't even like standard sex within marriage:  E.g., why in the US has there been a long tradition of June brides?  Because it was long standard that a girl would get married in her first June after high school graduation.  Then there was a good chance that she would be a ""teen mother"", married but still in her teens.  But the people with the norms keep screaming about the evils of ""teen pregnancy"".  Gee, Princess Di was a ""teen mom"".  The norms are so UPTIGHT about sex they don't even want a married woman of 18 or 19 to be a mommy.<p>Heck, some of the laws enforced as desired by former US Attorney General John Ashcroft would have most of the US male population in jail -- literally.  E.g., just take a picture at the beach where the picture has a girl under 18 and let a digital version of the picture get distributed at all.  JAIL.  According to Ashcroft, even a cartoon image would do.  We're talking UPTIGHT.  By the way, parents:  No baby pictures!<p>For the case of the picture with the article, the public repercussions, especially for the boy, from any suggestion that that couple, with the girl likely well under age 13, even engaged in just some 'touching' could be horrendous.  E.g., if the boy's father were a politician, then the news media could go wild for weeks.<p>The news media knows very well about the norms and how uptight many people in the US are and takes huge advantage to 'sell newspapers' or, now, get eyeballs for ads.<p>Sex outside of marriage, any touching related to sex, just talking about sex can have consequences that can ruin lives.  At work, a woman can get a man fired, and his career ruined, just by complaining ""He looked at me in a way that made me feel uncomfortable."".<p>Net, in our society, sex, nearly anything about sex, outside of marriage is DANGEROUS -- politically, legally, financially, etc.<p>The article is ignoring the strong norms and pushing a very 'liberal' view of sex maybe more like in, say, Sweden.  At one time in the US, the age of consent was 10 -- NOT NOW.  Maybe the US should return to the age of consent 10 or have something like Sweden (or maybe not), but currently that is very much NOT how the US is.<p>As dangerous as sex has been in the US, now with DNA testing it's much more dangerous.  E.g., consider the DNA testing of the stain on the little black dress of that White House Intern during the Clinton Administration.  Then consider how that stain was the 'seed' of a full impeachment process with all of the US Federal Government seriously distracted for months.  Clinton was seriously throttled in what he could do as the leader of the US.  We're talking SERIOUS and DANGEROUS.",1321721594

3255593,comment,3255399,3255529,4,0,faboo,,,"> Though if your business model is immoral when applied to poor folks, it's still immoral when applied to rich folks.<p>The markup on drug store cotton balls is shockingly high, like 1000%. Nobody who buys cotton balls cares though, because the $2 per bag they end up costing is a very small fraction of their income.<p>But take that to a developing country, and that $2 is completely unaffordable. You would be forcing people in need of sterile cotton swabs to pay a day's or a week's earnings, when their manufacture costs a few pennies.<p>I don't think the former example is unethical (indeed, the cost of a bag of cotton balls (in America) is probably far below what the market could truly bear). That stupendously high markup is fine because it still keeps the final price easily affordable.<p>In the latter example, that same markup makes cotton balls all but impossible to buy, when even a ""normal"" retail mark up of 25% would have kept the price in the cents and therefore at least approachable.

It was hard as hell... but a lot of companies served those markets tremendously well and made a lot of money.

Super cliche, but they use mobile phones in every aspect of their lives now, and it has made a tremendous difference. Something that used to require an hour bus ride to the nearest city and then waiting in line for an hour, ruining a days worth of work in the fields can now be accomplished in 5 minutes via SMS.<p>Airtel (one of the largest mobile providers in the world, one of the biggest companies in India) has made a tremendous amount of money by focusing not on ARPU (Avg. Revenue per user) like every other mobile company, but rather focusing on how much profit they can make per minute sold... they are happy to serve tons of farmers that only use their phone for 100 minutes a month (~$2 a month). If it was not profitable for Airtel, the poor would never have access to cellphones, something that has DRASTICALLY upgraded their lives. Nokia sells amazing phones tailored to that market for $20... they have radios, flashlights, and batteries that last a week (all crucial to rural India), and Nokia is able to maintain fantastic margins on those products. Airtel has an ARPU of $4 (contrast to US carriers ARPU of ~$55)... yet they have a $30Bn market cap<p>I actually co-wrote a case on this topic with professor CK Prahalad (the founder of base of the pyramid thought - you should read up on him. if this topic interests you at all read his books, particularly ""the fortune at the base of the pyramid"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._K._Prahalad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._K._Prahalad</a>)

3255550,comment,3255399,3255399,3,0,jdietrich,,,"Interesting example:<p>In the UK, we're seeing a huge increase in the number of payday lenders, offering small loans for less than a month, for a fee of about 10% of the loan amount. Our financial regulations require all credit products to prominently state the effective APR, so most of these lenders are forced to advertise a rate of circa 3000%. This is obviously a shockingly high figure, so there has been some amount of campaigning to set a cap or outlaw payday lending altogether.<p>What has been fascinating is that many poverty campaign groups have opposed a ban, on the basis that it would be bad for the poor. A loan at 3000% APR may well be cheaper than going overdrawn for a day and incurring a 30 fee, or having their electricity disconnected for non-payment and having to pay for reconnection. Most payday lending customers have no other access to legitimate credit; Such high rates are the only way to lend to them and still make any sort of profit. A ban would probably be good news for illegal loan sharks, who would become the lender of last resort.<p>Idealism is all well and good, but the solutions that offer practical change here and now often feel deeply uncomfortable.

The opposite of a loss. States can run at a deficit (in fact it's apparently the ahem, ""default"", case), companies can't. You either have a deficit at the end of the year/month/week/day or a profit. Or in extremely statistically and mathematically unlikely cases, an actual zero (no profit / no loss). The whole ""no-profit"" thing has blown out of proportion. Overwhelmingly profits are a sign of providing great value while achieving attractive end-consumer prices ie. saving people money/time/trouble/hassle. Profits are the reward that is empirically overwhelming reinvested in the business, but feel free to donate it to charity or have it halved by your government to ease the immorality you have permitted yourself to indulge in.",1321718455

All they need is a debit history and a credit history.</i><p>If by ""debit history"" and ""credit history"" you're thinking of how your bank transactions are recorded, then you may wish to look into the concept of accrual accounting.<p>Merely tracking cash in and out doesn't give you a full view of what the business is up to.<p>> <i>accept that some figures won't reflect exactly the reality of the balance, since some compensations are done immediately (automatically) while others are performed, manually, days or week later.</i><p>Well good luck with selling your ""eventually consistent"" accounting system.<p>While I would prefer if accounting systems could be improved to record and aggregate uncertainty for those places where values entered are based on what is realistically an estimation rule (eg depreciation, stock valuation rules etc), the fact is that all such rules are stated as part of the reports. Within that framework, you report as correctly as possible to the cent or better.<p>Otherwise bad things happen. Accountants lose their charters. Executives go to jail.

This is for the obvious reason that the mainframe is not always reachable and available; but to halt the operation of all cash machines is generally considered less than ideal.<p>I don't have a firm line on the etymology, but it seems to me that what we computer science types call a transaction is so called because of the accounting concept of a transaction.<p>In book entry you must always enter two items: a credit and a debit. Always. Before you make the transaction, the books are supposed to be consistent. And after, they are consistent.<p>One thing accountants do differently is that there are no deletes. You may only update. There are specialised transactions for correcting errors. Again: even if an error has been made, the erroneous state is still consistent before and after an erroneous transaction. And it is consistent before and after the correcting transaction.",1357818794

There are clauses in employment contracts to cover gross misconduct so that you can fire someone for stealing etc. If you can't afford the employee you can make them redundant - but there are rules about not filling a similar position for a certain amount of time thereafter to ensure that it's not used as a way of firing people just because you don't like them.

If Scheme or CL didn't exist, and somebody tried to launch them as new languages today with a first generation implementation, they wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell. Most probably CL or Scheme as new languages wouldn't get any traction even with a mature implementation + good library coverage right at the start. It's much easier for a language community to be self-perpetuating at a certain size than to actually grow to that size.<p>I agree that Scheme didn't only become substantial once the implementations became mature. But that's because it had a few fresh big ideas (lexical scoping/closures, CPS), not because it was new. Likewise it didn't become popular (as much as it ever became popular) just due to existing, but largely thanks to being used as the teaching language for a legendary intro course at a prestigious university.<p>As for the ""hype"" comment, that wasn't intended as a negative attribute. It's very hard for a language to succeed purely on its own merits. Tens of man years of effort had gone into Go before it was launched. It might still have failed had there not been such powerful marketing hooks in place (created by Bell Labs legends, having the appearance of being backed by Google). Arc had a good marketing hook as well. That would have made bootstrapping an initial community much easier than e.g. for Clojure.<p>And just to be clear this isn't intended as a personal criticism!

1112749,comment,1112439,1112439,0,0,ellyagg,,,"> The certainty of DNA testing means we can be positive the 250 cases listed in the Innocence Project report didn't commit the crimes for which they were convicted<p>This is simply not true. Matching DNA against the defendant is basically 100%, but that doesn't take into account the circumstances of the case and where that DNA fits into the evidentiary chain. All the DNA has to do is provide reasonable doubt. It does not prove innocence. Indeed, contrary to the claim, it is virtually certain that some of the convicted in the overturned cases <i>did</i> commit their crimes.<p>Because of the political will behind resurrected DNA cases, the circumstantial link doesn't need to be very strong to have a case overturned via DNA.",1265738327

But at the same time, allow copyright holders to pay a fee to extend the copyright for a further term.  If the fee went up on each term, it would encourage owners to only maintain their hold on particularly marketable properties, allowing the rest to lapse into public domain.<p>As a side benefit, this would go a long way towards reducing the ambiguity that plagues older copyrighted works that don't have a clear owner, but still haven't reached a date where their copyright has expired.  Either there would be a clear chain of documentation from when the rights were extended, or else you could safely assume the copyright had lapsed.",1265737066

Your concern over fully automating the transform is because it may introduce further cooperative threading ""yield""s that you cannot control.<p>My point is that under a preemptively threaded environment, any thread could at any time hijack the CPU and mutate your state - and this is no different whether the code is synchronous or CPS-transformed. A ""yield"" may occur randomly at any point in your code.

I still eat about 2000 calories a day (I'm 6'1"" and 168 pounds now, was 188 when I started).  You just need to eat the right calories.  The hardest thing for me was cutting out the bread and pasta.  I can still eat bread, but only ""sprouted wheat"" bread, which you can find at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.<p>Also, I eat real eggs (about 2 for breakfast scrambled with vegetables, slice of sprouted wheat toast, cup of fruit, 3 times a week) all the time.  The myth about eggs causing high cholesterol is just a myth.  Your body can process the cholesterol in eggs just fine, since your own liver can produce way more cholesterol in a single day.  It just depends on the rest of your diet.<p>It sounds like you are making some great choices so far, but I would personally avoid the ""low-fat"" foods since most of them are packed with sugar, or even worse, High Fructose Corn Syrup.  Instead, just eat good fats.  Try putting olive oil and balsamic vinegar on your salad instead of sugary ""light balsamic vinagrette.""<p>Also, you're right to cut out the fruit juices.  Unfortunately, as much as I used to love orange juice, it has a lot of sugar.  Much better to just eat an orange, because the fiber that comes with the orange will make your body take more energy to digest it, and your body will absorb the sugar more slowly.<p>I also cut down on my alcohol intake a lot.  I can still drink a glass of wine with dinner every day, but I stay away from drinking beer or more than 1 drink at a time.  Green tea twice a day is also really good for me.<p>Stick with it!

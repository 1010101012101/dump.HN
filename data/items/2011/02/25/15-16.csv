Also, a lot of our deals involve more than two people - like person A threatening to sell property X, that person B wants, to person C for a dollar, unless person B sells property Y to A. Or selling somebody a property that completes a monopoly for an amount of money determined purely based on that person not being able to afford to put houses in it quickly. Mortgaging properties before selling them for the same effect. Or two players trading each other into monopolies so they can either eliminate another weak player, or have a chance to compete with a player who got the first monopoly. Spending thousands on a $200 property. Making and breaking gentleman's agreements.<p>Really a great time.

2262527,story,,,202,158,jrookie,"I'm a cargo cult programmer, help me",,"Hello HN I come to you for help.<p>I went to college and got an Information systems degree, it was a crappy college so the most programming we had was dabbling with arrays and pointers in C, not much Algorithsms & Data Structures, no unix, no Operating Systems and no compilers, and most importantly no problem solving. Half way through college my father died so I had to find a job to make ends meet,  somehow i got sucked  into the java ""enterprise"" world where I've been for the past 5 years, glueing API's and frameworks together, with some Javascript and SQL on the side, however on the verge of my 30's, I now have found that I lack the fundamentals of Computer Science,  the things every programmer should know: Algo's, Data Structures, Operating Systems an understanding of compilers and being profficient with linux. Eventually I plan on going back to a real University and getting a CS degree, but I'm unable to do so at the moment, this is why I have come to ask for help.<p>OTOH I have given thought about if programming is really for me, I have found that I'm really, really bad at problem solving and ""thinking outside of the box"" I have come to accept that I'm really not smart. I'm slow, forgetfull, concepts never seem to stick, I have to force myself to not take things for granted, it seems no matter how hard i try I can't look at problems from different perspectives and understand the  implications of a particular solution, I'm starting to think I may have a learning dissability, or that is because I lack the basic toolkit for problem solving, but I really think I'm just not very smart.<p>Of course the realization of my lack of skills, as you may have guessed, is because I want a better job, and there seems to be no place in the world for dumb programmers, and to be honest this is something I understand given my limitations and looking at my other peers, seeing how long it takes for me when programming something or understanding a problem, seeing how fast other people can grasp concepts that I struggle with, I understand that I'm just not valuable that all my experience\nmeans nothing, So I'm back to 0.<p>I have started going through the basic Algo's and Data structures again with a basic Java book about algorithms (I tried cormen but no way I could wrap my head around that stuff, I forgot all the calculus/math from college and i just lack the mathematical maturity for that book).<p>I'm also trying to study discrete maths, Operating Systems and compilers, of course one step at a time. I imagine this will take me years just to get a basic understanding of all these concepts.<p>And finally trying to memorise all those linux commands I ALWAYS forget.<p>Lastly I'm trying to learn technologies and languages that will help me get a better job, I'm still not decided whether I should learn Ruby on rails or python or Lisp or just stick to Java and learn Android and do my own thing  and forget about joining a ""cool"" startup or working at the big guys like google(10 years from now after I become a real programmer of course...) Or quitting programming altogether.<p>Hackers, I understand this is a long and boring post, filled with grammar & spelling errors (English is not my primary language), but I only ask of you to guide me whether I should continue this path in which I have invested all my adult life on or just start again from zero, I just don't want to be a cargo cult programmer anymore.<p>Thank you",1298649244

So their argument is that unions can't be the problem because charter schools don't have them and are doing just as bad.  But that's a straw man.<p>Charter schools allow for better management they don't guarantee it.  So in the first few decades of a charter school system there will be a lot of bad ideas and a lot of good ideas.  But the bad ideas will throw off the average.<p>But the bottom line is at least the well managed  charter schools can take steps to correct problems where as regular public schools can't because of union rules.  Which is why some Charter schools do dramatically better.",1298646160

I pull up a language reference and just go to town.<p>There was a time when I wasn't confident enough to do that, and would avoid new languages/frameworks/whatever, because I didn't 'know' them. I am so much better now for having moved past that.<p>I think I agree more with the feel of the article than the actual statement. If his point is to say that you should persist even if you aren't perfect at something, then absolutely. If he's saying you should just write bad code and not worry about it, obviously, I disagree.<p>But when you start, you <i>always</i> write bad code. I learned python a few weeks ago for a pipeline for an iphone game I'm making. I'm learning Objective C right now. I know a lot of what I've written is probably crap -- but as I write more, I realize what was crap and fix it when I bump in to it.<p>The learning mindset is more important than the ""stubbornly move forward"" mindset. His skull demo example is a good story. If that person never learned another thing, he would eventually be driven insane by trying to deal with the complexity of a large scale project. If he learned ways to improve, moving forward, he could continue building even bigger and better bleeding skulls.",1298646090

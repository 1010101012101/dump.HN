They&#x27;ve invested in polished checkout experiences, it&#x27;s what they do, and it moves the burden of PCI compliance, PII storage, SSL etc to the service.  When Stripe exists, why would you even go down the merchant account route anymore?<p>Scaring them with the bad stuff might not be effective, people don&#x27;t react well to being told they&#x27;re doing everything wrong.

10027858,comment,10026103,10026969,0,0,esaym,,,"Before I went to school for CS, I was actually an aircraft mechanic. I personally worked on this plane at the L3 center in Waco, TX. And now for the rest of the story:<p>From what I recall, the plans for an air-born telescope were conceived around 1992-93. The plane was located and purchased (don&#x27;t know from who, but it was first operated by PanAm) sometime before 1995 and brought to the L3 airstrip in Waco, TX. I came on board with L3 for another project in 2005, and the plane still had a lot of work to be done. Sometimes we &#x27;d hit a &#x27;slow week&#x27; on my current project and my manager would send me over to the hanger where Sofia was to &#x27;help&#x27;. Which was where a bulk of the problems came from.<p>I don&#x27;t think there was a steady stream of money for the project, or at least the parts we needed. So people were constantly moved from other projects onto Sofia as needed and there was always lots of rework and spin up time. The core team with the plane was probably only 10 people or so. When I was there, most of the mounts and cutout for the telescope had already been completed. I can&#x27;t remember if the telescope remained installed or not, but there were pictures around various buildings of the &#x27;first light&#x27;, so the telescope had at least been installed at one time.<p>Most of my jobs were repairing damages to the aluminum flooring and ceiling substructures (not sure why they were damaged). Most of the time I was handed a mixed bag of aluminum floor repair brackets with a warning of &#x27;careful, the last 2 guys that worked this DR (discrepancy report) don&#x27;t work here any more&#x27;, so the jobs were  always stressful.<p>I would spend a lot of time just trying to find the damaged areas, and normally they weren&#x27;t fixed because some equipment was in the way, so you ended up burning a lot of time on already over timed tickets just looking (hence why these tickets were the &#x27;widow makers&#x27;). There were many large .5”-1” iron plates mounted all over the floors for ballast, can&#x27;t remember if they were going to stay installed or removed when all the computer equipment was installed, but they were normally always in the way.<p>I finally managed to pull some strings with another manager that ran a night shift on a completely different project (P3 wing restoration) with a story about how I wanted to take training classes during the day at a local tech school. It worked and they put me on his team and my Sofia days were over. Shortly after that, due to another project needing hanger space, they pushed Sofia out onto an unused taxiway to make room. They then hung/installed all four engines on the wings for &#x27;visual progress&#x27; even though they knew they wouldn&#x27;t even be testing them for another few years.<p>I worked the night shift for about a year and a half before I moved in with some relatives and went to University for CS. This was partly motived by the German engineering team (don&#x27;t know why they were all German) that would visit Sofia from time to time and plug in their laptops to all the telescope equipment on the plane and hack on stuff (I guess) while they laughed and joked all day. This made me quite jealous, and as a Linux geek, I then knew I was in the wrong place for a career path :)<p>Extra note: if I ever have another daughter, I am pushing my wife to allow me to name her Sofia, upon which I will hang a picture of this plane in her room :)",1439052814

I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve watched anyone die but it isn&#x27;t &quot;fun&quot; for most people (either the watching or the dying). Many people are there with their parents when they pass, or with grandparents or loved ones struck down by accident or disease. So in general I think everyone will likely watch as at least one other person they know and care about dies.<p>When that happens, you may find yourself sharing the dying person&#x27;s pain, and that is a heavy burden. When I am listening to, or reading about, the death of someone. I wish for them an an easy passing, with as little pain and suffering as possible, for both them and their families and loved ones, because I know from my own experience how painful it is to watch someone die and be unable to help them. So for me, the living, it makes a huge difference if the person died doing something they loved (and thus were likely experiencing joy and satisfaction at the end) then knowing someone died slowly, painfully, and inevitably spending hours, perhaps days or weeks, moving toward their own demise.",1439051883

And if you discount that driving force and that motivation, it isn&#x27;t clear that a CoC is either needed or useful.<p>If you try to think about it in a clean-slate way, sort of; forget &quot;oppression&quot;, &quot;microagressions against minorities&quot; and all the other politicized jargon that the current version is peppered with, and ask yourself (answers are my opinions, obviously)...<p>Q. Is there a problem with some open source communities being too hostile, unwelcoming, potentially harassing to many people?
A. Yes. Some communities are clearly much more &quot;nice&quot; than others. Some are clearly much more welcoming of newbies, etc.<p>Q. How does this &quot;bad behavior&quot; manifest itself, in actual open source communities?
A. Mostly by how much rudeness and brusqueness some regulars of the community feel they can treat others with. If you hang around on forums, issues, IRC channels etc. enough you can get a clear feel of the &quot;niceness meter&quot;. Sometimes there&#x27;s also explicit misogyny, but that&#x27;s relatively rare. Other explicit forms of hostility (e.g. racism, transmisogynism) are even rarer to nonexistent. It&#x27;s simply that if the overall level of niceness is low, then people behave like assholes. Asshole-like behavior is easy to interpret as racism etc.<p>Q. Is this a huge problem? Should we invest effort in trying to make communities more nice?
A. I don&#x27;t know, seems like a personal call. I personally like the nice and welcoming communities much more, and don&#x27;t really see the point of being rude and hostile (I think it&#x27;s counterproductive and not only wrong).<p>Q. Is a code of conduct a way to achieve that?
A. Doubt it. Seems like the norm set by the leaders of the community, together with a few clear examples of &quot;we will not tolerate this kind of behavior&quot;, is how it&#x27;s successfully done. Is there a project which went &quot;not nice -> adopted CoC -> became clearly nicer&quot;? I haven&#x27;t seen any.",1439051526

Firstly, they call it <i>guidelines</i> and not <i>code of conduct.</i> That enforces that they are human and flexible.<p>The problem with having a code of conduct with a large fraternity of people is that you immediately give the community an intent of what you like and what you don&#x27;t like.

If you&#x27;re seeing this all over the place, it may be worth wrapping the API in more pythonic terms. &#x27;Getters&#x27; taking no arguments, for example, are often a code-smell in python, though queries (as in your case) are a good exception, since it is also not great to have properties do expensive work (like querying a DB, say).",1439050047

10027637,comment,10027318,10027584,0,0,MrRadar,,,"> It is fn. expensive when compared to EU prices. Why is that?<p>US carriers have to cover a land area 1/3rd greater than the total land area of Europe[0] and they have just barely half the population to spread the costs over[1].  Also there are no inter-state roaming fees in the US, from what I understand most European carriers have roaming fees outside of your home country.  That doesn&#x27;t explain the entire price gap, but even in a perfect world US phone plans would still be more expensive than European plans just on that basis alone.<p>Additionally, Verizon&#x27;s main selling point is they have the largest coverage area so their plans are always the most expensive.  T-Mobile, Sprint and many MVNOs offer much cheaper service (with less coverage).  For example you can get 100 minutes/unlimited texts/5 GB of 4G LTE data for $30/month on T-Mobile prepaid, 300 minutes/unlimited texts/2.5 GB data for $35/month on Virgin Mobile (uses the Sprint network), or unlimited minutes/texts/2.5 GB 4G LTE data (throttled to 8 Mbps) for $35/month (with autopay discount) on Cricket (uses the AT&T network).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28land+area+of+usa+-+land+area+of+alaska+%29+%2F+land+area+of+europe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28land+area+of+usa+-+l...</a> (excluding Alaska since it&#x27;s huge and almost nobody lives there)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+usa+%2F+population+of+europe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+of+usa+%2F+p...</a>",1439049807

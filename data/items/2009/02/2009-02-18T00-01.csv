Living here means being able to do things like apply to yc, whereas I'd probably never consider moving to Boulder or Boston if it just came down to 5 digits of seed investment. I'd rather stay here and force my projects to happen during nights and weekends instead.

485216,comment,485012,485198,0,0,agentcoops,,,"What the author is disagreeing with, the Hilbert-Bourbaki method, isn't mathematics as the proving of theorems, but rather the proving of theorems as a necessarily formal task; that is, that when one is doing a proof it ought to be done in a (preferably intuitionistic) formal system with no steps omitted.  The alternative, and what almost all mathematicians do in practice, is to informally lay out a proof that any professional mathematician (but, perhaps not a computer) can follow, filling in details as necessary.<p>Further, formal computer proofs are rarely wholly generated by computer.  Rather the user specifies goals and tactics which the computer verifies or refutes.  If one is using a reasonably powerful logic (ie first-order and not propositional) there are only relatively small tasks that can be automated.  Hence, the result is often equivalent, or, at least, close to a human generated proof in terms of what is illuminated about the mathematical statement, but every step is necessarily valid.<p>Further, there is a field of modern mathematical logic called proof mining which concerns itself with the analysis of fully formal proofs and can often obtain illuminating details from a formal proof that wouldn't be possible from an informal equivalent.<p>This isn't to say that all mathematics should be formal in the sense indicated, but just to point out that it remains an interesting endeavor that is worth keeping an eye on.  Also, note that the author /does/ think that formal verification of this sort can be useful for software development which is indeed what formal methods are mostly used for these days.",1234917744

The idea behind many algorithmic proofs and,  I assume, that of the original poster, is to prove that ones implementation in fact does what you intended.  For example, proving that a sorting algorithm always outputs a properly sorted list or something to that effect.<p>Modern theorem provers are also pretty awesome in that they can often, using the correspondence between formal proofs and programs (the Curry-Howard isomorphism for those interested), turn a proof that some unspecified function F, say, sorts a list into a Haskell/ML implementation of a function satisfying that proof.",1234916906

485200,comment,485012,485068,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"I think it's more a ""Humans vs Computers"" debate. Some background:<p>Tom Hales cleverly reduced the Kepler Conjecture to the solution thousands of linear programming problems: if all the solutions are bigger than something, the kepler conjecture is true. Then he had a computer solve the LP problems, and the result was that Kepler was true.<p>However, his solution was informal in the following sense; he didn't have a rigorous proof that the solution of the LP problems was accurate, nor were his programs proven correct. Now he is attempting to redo the proof in HOL, a formal theorem proving system.<p>More background: no math paper is completely formal. All involve some handwaving, especially the 200 page monsters that appear in Annals of Math. An example from a paper I'm currently writing: ""It can be easily seen by elementary calculus arguments that...""<p>Doron is arguing that the mathematical community is holding Hale's computer proof to a higher standard than it would hold a comparable 200 page human-written paper. Basically, he is claiming that we should accept an informal computer-assisted proof just like we would accept an informal human-written proof.",1234916763

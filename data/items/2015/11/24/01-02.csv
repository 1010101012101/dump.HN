10618679,comment,10615250,10615904,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"The thing I hate about the truth-o-meter stuff (either promises kept or broken) is that so much of it is still subjective and a matter of degrees and opinions. If Obama (just as an example) promised to &quot;implement&quot; some program or tax reform, what exactly does that mean? Someone could feel like Obama kept that promise so long as he put forward (that is, lobbies for the introduction of) a bill about it, even if it was defeated. Others might feel he broke that promise even if he put forward a bill, and the bill was passed and signed into law, because they would say that the extent of the bill should not (in their opinion) count as &quot;implementing&quot; something -- e.g. it doesn&#x27;t go far enough in their desired direction in order to justify even calling it an &quot;implementation.&quot;<p>None of this stuff is spelled out in specifics before election night and put up for bid on something like a prediction market. Failing that, I think we can only really say he &quot;kept&quot; or &quot;broke&quot; promises whenever there is a super clear, unambiguously understood outcome that can be indisputably verified and doesn&#x27;t rely on anyone&#x27;s interpretation of degrees.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t address the further fact that many people find some of promises to be really insignificant next to other ones, and so they might do an importance-weighted sum of kept promises instead of just an equal-weighted sum. The total number of kept promises may not matter to them much if two or three major promises are believed to be broken.",1448330076

When you ask a request &quot;What&#x27;s in you?&quot; in Clojure you can just look at the data and find out. In Java you can ctrl+space in your IDE and look for public methods that by convention start with &#x27;get&#x27;, and then for the return values of those things also look for things that start with &#x27;get&#x27;, but that&#x27;s a pretty impoverished way to get at the data. Try printing it out and you&#x27;re likely to just get a memory address, great. So what do types buy you? Sometimes performance, but if that were always true then all static languages should be about as fast as C. The other thing is this &quot;certainty&quot; mentioned, and that certainty is just that you didn&#x27;t make a typo or spelling error, woop-dee-doo, those are among the fewest sets of errors dynamic programming language users run in to, especially when you change your workflow to take advantage of the nature of dynamic languages, and a more valuable certainty is that this piece of data you have isn&#x27;t going to change underneath you.

Doing a recv on it, blocks the current thread. Pretty sure by default IO is synchronous. Sure at some point they are all connected to a single wire plugged into the switch and there is a single network card. But if you are thinking that low, then well javascript is not the framework to talk about we are in firmware, dpdk, and driver land.<p>The socket API is synchronous. Do do stuff &quot;asynchronously&quot; you have to go the extra mile and enable turn on some options, use select/poll/epoll callbacks, explicitly pass state around between callbacks etc.<p>> What blocking does is adding an extra step (start the process AND waiting for the result) and thereby hiding something.<p>See to me at the socket layer non-blocking is the extra step. Having to enable a new mode, then use some extra polling hub to see which socket has data etc. That mixes context between separate requests, etc.<p>> I often end up implementing quite complex state machines for heavy IO related code<p>In specializes cases for performance reasons I think switching to asynchronous, but that is a rather special case. It works for short callback chains and situations optimized for IO throughput say things like nginx or haproxy.

It therefore didn&#x27;t have much choice about its arguments, though (like every other OS supplier) it obviously wanted to include a browser. Equally obviously, delivering a free browser as part of the OS was good for consumers, which is why Microsoft won the browser bundling case on appeal.<p>Microsoft had also componentized the browser so that different functions could be used by other programs, which to some extent, did make it part of the OS. (Much of the anti-trust case argument on that topic was phenomenally stupid.)<p><i>>It was also forcing PC manufacturers to pay a royalty for every PC sold, whether or not it was bundled with DOS or Windows</i><p>Don&#x27;t think so. That was a deal offered to some OEMs, but as far as I know, it was never forced on anybody. In any case, the US Justice Department banned the idea in 1994. I tend to think 21+ years is a bit of long time to hold a grudge about something that was killed before it took off.<p><i>> Digital Research -- the company Microsoft essentially stole DOS from, but that&#x27;s another story</i><p>Well, DR screwed up massively by refusing to sign a deal with IBM, then by charging too much for DR DOS, and then Apple screwed it in a court case over the UI in DR GEM.

10618544,comment,10606852,10612672,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> If, in your definition, basic income is neutral on what the marginal tax rate is, then your statement &quot;We already know how to design a program that won&#x27;t discourage work. It&#x27;s called a basic income.&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Of course it does, because it&#x27;s in the context of receiving the benefit. Since receiving the benefit is unconditional, it doesn&#x27;t cost you money/benefits to take a job or work more hours, unlike with means tested programs which do exactly that.<p>How the government comes up with the money to pay out the benefit is a separate question because you can do it in any number of ways. Imagine the government pays for the basic income by conquering foreign lands and seizing their resources. Unambiguously no disincentive to work for all the citizens.<p>Obviously in the real world the money is going to come from taxes. But taxes are separate. All transfer programs require taxes, <i>on top of</i> the effects created by the program itself. Because the method of taxation that has zero effect on the incentive to work is the mirror image of the basic income: Everyone pays the same fixed dollar amount in taxes regardless of income. Using that method of taxation to fund a basic income converts it from a transfer payment to a no-op.<p>So if your point is that you cannot have a transfer payment without creating a disincentive to work for someone, that is correct, because that is what a transfer payment is: In order to take from those with more and give to those with less, you have to condition at least one of the taking or the giving on the existence of some threshold level of wealth.<p>But the difference between the program and the tax that pays for it is still quote important, because the people they affect are not necessarily the same people. For example, suppose you want to fund some transfer program using a tax exclusively paid by the top 1% of income earners. Everyone in the bottom 99% therefore does not pay the tax at all and is not directly affected by it. But now the separate choice comes between whether the program is a traditional means tested welfare program or a basic income. The means tested program will provide a disincentive for the 99% to work because the government will claw back some significant portion of the money they earn; the basic income will not, even inclusive of its funding source, because it is not funded by them.",1448327873

But the benefits of dynamic languages still exist. There are reasons people like both types of languages.<p>However, I think a more relevant point was made in the article: that statically-typed languages are looking more and more dynamic. And we can add to that that we see signs of dynamic languages adding more &#x27;static&#x27; features, like optional types. Those are signs of convergence, of both major classes of languages learning from each other and improving.<p>But I still don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll end up in the middle with &quot;static, but feels totally dynamic&quot;. We&#x27;ll still have both types of languages around.",1448327067

Now that people actually have a rational financial reason to trade a little bit of their own lives to strangers (needlesticks aren't painless, and donors need to sit for hours to actually donate the cells), they'll go through with it a lot more.

You have accepted that artificial entities such as corporations should be treated in a similar way to real people. At that point, you might as well just apportion votes by something like market cap and be done with it.<p>Personally, as a non-US citizen but part of an international community that is inevitably affected by bad government in the US anyway, I am hoping for a bigger version of what we did to our MPs in the run up to the last election: find a convenient political excuse to remove a substantial proportion of incumbents from the running altogether, and then not give any party outright control of the following Parliament. That should have led to fundamental reform of our voting system, but the campaign in favour of such reform were so incompetent that it was a damp squib in the end. In any case, I think we are being damaged considerably less by the coalition government we have today than we would have been under any one of the major parties alone (which is intentionally a pretty damning indictment of all the major parties). The US is in a much worse state than we are, because the whole deck is stacked so heavily against minor candidates that you're basically locked into a two-party mess until something revolutionary happens, but ruffling enough feathers to remind the public's representatives that lobbyists do not (yet) actually have a vote would be a good start.",1322797922

3302489,story,3296691,,1,0,secthrowaway,,,"You actually can't handle classified data, or derive something from classified data, that doesn't <i>automatically</i> classify the derived work (a report, or some such) at <i>at least</i> the same level. To not do that risks releasing the information and you can actually end up in prison over it, or at the very least lose your job.<p>So in 99% of the cases it's not like you make a decision to ""classify"" something. It is by its nature classified.<p>Think of it this way. You have a friend that tells you via email a secret. This secret can only be known between you and your friend. For example, you are arranging a surprise party for a third friend.<p>Using this knowledge it is your job to get a birthday cake that has the person's name and age (and a decoration) on it. But the only baker in town is also friends with the birthday friend. You don't want to risk the baker leaking the surprise of the cake to your friend. So you decide to buy a blank cake, and decorate it yourself.<p>This cake is also classified at the same level of the original information (Classified//only between you and your friend). Because it is derived from the knowledge of the birthday party email).<p>Now your friend prints off decorations with some party specific information, say a sign or some streamers or something. Those are also classified at the same level.<p>Suppose there are some other odds and ends that are a result of this email and the party plans. Say a ""making of video"" for the party etc.<p>Now let's say you also hire a clown for the party. You only provide the clown the time and place to come and perform, not any other details. Because the clown isn't in on the original secret, the arrangements for the clown and the various transaction documents pertaining to it are at a lower classification level. You might still not want the birthday friend to know that somebody <i>he knows</i> hired a clown on his birthday (a convenient coincidence) so you swear the clown to secrecy.<p>Even if it gets out and the birthday friend asks the clown directly, the clown has plausible dependability and doesn't know <i>why</i> he was hired, only that he was. So it's not <i>good</i> that your friend finds out, but it doesn't entirely screw up the surprise.<p>I'm stretching the analogy a bit, but hopefully that makes it clear how knowledge of single piece of information (the email that established the surprise party) can end up producing so many classified documents and how that process happens.",1322794937

Just happens to be ring0 rather than ring3.<p>I don't think it is realistic to expect all drivers to be Free Software especially specifically distributed under GPL. A huge number of Linux drivers are GPL anyway.<p>What makes you so confident that Linux hackers would have managed to reverse engineer all nVidia's stuff to the point of having a good stable performant driver? Especially considering nVidia release new cards with new capabilities (thus requiring driver modifications) very frequently.<p>If nVidia had decided that they would release no free driver and therefor no driver at all, I don't see the business case for somebody being paid to develop a free software driver for nVidia cards and it's certainly not a weekend project.",1322794817

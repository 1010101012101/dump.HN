It's very unlikely that your work may catapult your big company into stratospheric valuation levels. At most, you will help improve the product line and increase profits, which are enjoyed by all employees via stock options.<p>In a startup, the work of some key employees may make the difference between a viable/successful product and a failed product, and in turn may make the difference between a huge exit and complete failure.<p>The thing is, though, that those key employees are unlikely to see much of a return on their hard work. From all the horror stories we have been reading about on HN lately (about preferred stock, etc) there are many ways in which employees end up with a pittance. The people who end up with the most money are the investors, the founders and maybe some high-level executives that were brought in.<p>It seems very demotivating to me to think that my work is basically just a pursuit of making other people rich.<p>Big company life may not be as 'exciting' as startup life, but it seems more motivating to do your share and get your share in return.<p>Even in big companies, I can see that executives make far more when the stock goes up than regular employees, but it's not like those executives will make zero without you. You are a small piece of the big picture and are rewarded accordingly (with a good salary, usually great benefits, and stock options). In a startup you could be a big piece of the puzzle and still not make much, even if your contributions result in others making millions instead of zero.<p>Of course, a lot of people are in it for more than just the money, but still when I recently saw all those higher-ups together and realized that my team and I are working hard to essentially enrich others, it has been very demotivating.<p>What do you guys think?",1324011190

The reason Josh found MG's analogy offensive is that there are <i>also</i> lots of big and little details that Android gets right and iOS gets wrong.<p>For example, take a look at cross-application cooperation and integration. It is good that iOS 5 added Twitter integration, but to an Android user the Twitter-specific integration makes iOS devices look crippled (in this area). With appropriate applications installed, even the more than three-year-old <i>G1</i> is integrated with Twitter, Facebook, Picasa and whatever else you want. And these integration details matter because they are what allow Android users to create sophisticated, dynamic cross-application workflows.<p>Claiming that one side has a subtle superiority that only the right people can appreciate when the reality is more balanced is what is offensive.",1324009892

If you don't have an opinion or belief (preferably a strong one) many people will regard you as ignorant, even if you're working from the same set of facts as they are.<p>When there's not enough information, it seems that people look first to familiar memes or established narratives. When it comes to US-Iranian relations, it's usually either the idea of American military supremacy (so it must have been an accident or Iranian bluffing) or the idea that the US intends to go to invade Iran any day now (so it's somehow an American ploy to start a war). There is a grain of truth in each which surely plays into the whole truth, but there are <i>far</i> too many unknowns for anybody commenting on the Internet to say with the kind of confident certainty that we so often do.<p>A site like Reddit (or HN, or anything with a comment box) amplifies this, because people like posting comments, and how can you comment on a story if you haven't decided what your opinion is about it? So people skim the article or just read the headline[1], draw conclusions which may be highly speculative, and then post whatever they think based on at most a few minutes of thought. And they might do this a dozen times a day, for years. So it becomes really natural for people to dash off whatever the easiest thing they can think to say is given the context, even as the context changes and the story evolves.

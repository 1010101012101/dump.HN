Can anyone name a presumptive presidential candidate who has spoken out against NSA abuses? I can name one but I&#x27;d get downvotes just for mentioning his name.<p>The simple tragedy is that most Americans don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to understand the nuances of the issue -- at least not to a degree that they&#x27;d vote on that issue.<p>Most people seem to think &quot;higher taxes bad; tax the rich; end welfare; increase welfare; no free school lunches; more free lunches..&quot; People seem to be almost binary in their understanding of the issues of the day.<p>Let&#x27;s hope that changes. The fact is that most people can at least understand the idea of online privacy, but when issues like illegal file sharing or similar things that aren&#x27;t in the mainstream of your average person, then the passion for the issue is muted.<p>If, for example, there were high profile cases that made the national news about Grandma getting violated in a detrimental way by the NSA, then maybe the issue would gain traction. However, privacy violations typically happen to either a &quot;criminal&quot; or &quot;someone else.&quot; So the issue is ignored.<p>It&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s issue, but the issue hasn&#x27;t been well framed.

It&#x27;s always a debate whether it&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; climbing, and some people think that being proud of how dangerous your route is is a bit childish, but in any case everyone agrees that it&#x27;s a different kind of climbing.<p>A 5.10 toprope is moderately difficult to a fit person with little experience, but it gets more difficult when you do it outdoors, up high, on a two week trip. It&#x27;s like a jog and a marathon run - I can run a 7 minute mile, but not 26 of them.<p>Then there is  the fact that ratings are subjective and Yosemite 5.9-10 is MUCH harder than what you&#x27;d get in a gym or really anywhere else.

In order to avoid this problem, the AST would have to be a more abstract representation of the semantics. And coming up with a sufficiently expressive, tractable, and neutral representation of natural language semantics is an unsolved problem that people are still devoting their whole careers to.<p>I was briefly involved in a very early stage startup that was considering using systems like this for better machine translation.

I think from memory that printing CHR$(23) would also invoke it in software.<p>I cut my programming teeth on the old TRS-80 too. Learned Basic, then Z80 assembler. Still have mine with the interface and pair of disks.<p>I came across the line number hack when writing a line renumber program in assembler. While getting it working, I screwed up quite a lot and ended up with all kinds of values in there. Screw-ups can be a great way to learn, or especially trying to fix them!<p>The line number was held as two bytes at the start of each line, which could also be massaged by using the Poke command. When listing the program, Basic expects the lines numbers to increase in value and stops listing as soon as it comes to one that&#x27;s smaller than the last one (presumably thinks it&#x27;s reached the end of the program). Poking 65535 (255,255) into the first line does the trick.<p>Surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t affect the running of the program. When looking for targets of GOTO or GOSUB, it seems to scan the whole program and not stop at the hacked line number.

8892695,comment,8890436,8890762,0,0,bunderbunder,,,"> In managed languages you spend much of your time chasing pointers around memory.<p>Not necessarily. There are some compelling counterexamples indicating that, in the kinds of problem spaces Java and C# are designed for, a C++ programmer will have to go to great lengths to meet or exceed the performance of a naive Java or C# program.  That famous series of blog posts by Rico Mariani and Raymond Chen over at Microsoft comes to mind.<p>What it comes down to is this:  Business applications tend to create a lot of objects[1] that have variable lifetimes.  In a language like C++ this leads to memory fragmentation - lots of little gaps start to form when shorter-lived objects that were allocated between longer-lived objects get freed.  New objects get put into those gaps when they fit, which means new memory allocations involve time-consuming hunts for appropriately-sized gaps.  And objects that are allocated about the same time may end up going into gaps that are widely separated in memory - which can be seriously detrimental to locality of reference, since things that are allocated together are generally also accessed together.<p>But Java and C# have a secret weapon here: You don&#x27;t get pointers[2], so the memory manager is free to move objects around without you even knowing.  And that means they get to have compacting garbage collectors.  Compacting improves locality of reference by, well, compacting.  But it also means that performance-wise, the heap starts to behave a bit more like a stack: Finding an empty slot where you can allocate new stuff works exactly the same as in stack allocation, and is therefore very fast.  All your live, up-in-the-air stuff is very close together because it&#x27;s all getting allocated at the top of the heap.  Etc. etc.  Long story short the cost of pointer-chasing, which you&#x27;d probably be doing anyway, is mitigated quite a bit.<p>C++ will absolutely let you make up the difference by carefully arranging your data, micro-managing what gets allocated when and where, etc.  And that does mean that you can make it <i>scream</i>.  But in terms of the default performance you can expect out of a language, the story can be quite a bit different.  Not as well-publicized, either, since the most well-known source for language benchmarks quite explicitly makes itself into a game about who can submit the most efficient implementation in their favorite language.   I&#x27;d submit, though, that the vast majority of us should be more worried about the typical outcome than the best-case scenario. That&#x27;s the outcome we&#x27;ll actually see.<p>[1]In this case, by object I mean &quot;thing that&#x27;s allocated on the heap&quot;.

My understanding is a whole lot of sites have deployed SPDY because it solves real problems for them, and HTTP/2 is largely the same thing. Or am I wrong?<p>Lots of sites have deployed SPDY because it is expected to result in HTTP/2 and people want to be using up-to-date technologies. I&#x27;m not sure which problems it&#x27;s actually addressing, though.<p>The changes which it actually implements so far, such as HTTP header data compression and TCP parallelism, are nice-to-haves but are frequently sidestepped by other means which are more mature. The only real benefit to the new standard seems to be some performance enhancements, many of which were possible to implement without the standard.<p>> Leaving a giant security gap? Which gap? You must be referring to either SSL or cookies, and calling cookies a &quot;giant security gap&quot; is .... unhelpful, at best.<p>Lack of defense against pervasive monitoring. There are a number of opportunistic encryption schemes which have been proposed and which have not gained traction because of various issues they cause with existing SPDY design. This is actually even worse, because HTTP/3 will almost certainly also be burdened by these same design issues because of reverse compatibility concerns. An HTTP/2 standard which doesn&#x27;t include encryption may actually mean that we may have to break reverse-compatibility to get adequate encryption, or worse, that we may never get an encrypted-by-default HTTP standard.<p>> Sigh. I&#x27;ve being writing software for the last 15 years, with nearly 8 of them spent at one of the worlds biggest websites. I think I&#x27;m allowed an opinion on HTTP.<p>I agree: you should be allowed an opinion. My point was not that you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed an opinion. My point was that you can&#x27;t discard PHK&#x27;s opinion simply because Varnish doesn&#x27;t fully support HTTP/1.1.<p>> From what I can tell by half following this debate, phk wants HTTP/2 to be even more ambitious than it already is, and the reason for not doing that is to try and ensure it actually gets deployed, implemented and the IETF stays relevant with what real deployments are actually doing.<p>If all the standard does is define what people are already doing, then it&#x27;s not relevant. It&#x27;s descriptive, not prescriptive. We don&#x27;t need an organization to describe what people are doing: there are plenty of blogs on the internet that do a more thorough job of that.<p>The role of the IETF, as I see it, is to prescribe best practices for the industry, not to describe practices that are already occurring. If all that is required for an IETF standard is that a bunch of people have already done something, then the IETF has already lost relevance.",1421332994

You may very well be sent to the resident expert at that hospital, but that expert may be far from expert when compared to other facilities.<p>In one case I am familiar with, someone with an acoustic neuroma was offered treatment at a few very well known, large, academic hospitals, but those hospitals only treated about 25 or so of these cases a year.  It was amazing to me that a general neurosurgeon would offer treatment when they only had ever done 20 of the relevant surgeries in their career, and not mention that there were facilities with vastly more experience.  Going with a specialist hospital, the patient found a team that did a few hundred of the relevant surgeries each year and achieved a good outcome.<p>This leads me to think that neuro and other surgery might be better off following the regional heart hospital model so that expertise gets concentrated.",1421332941

As a town we have been complaining about it for years but nothing ever happens as we have no power over Openreach because they are a private company and are not answerable to us and they also have a de facto monopoly on the infrastructure so we can&#x27;t take our business elsewhere.<p>At least if broadband was provided by the local council, we could complain to our local councillor when it&#x27;s not working. This system works fine for other infrastructure, e.g. if the council haven&#x27;t gritted the roads we phone our councillor and she gets on to the right department, gives them a row and they sort it out.<p>As it is, most broadband infrastructure improvement projects in the UK are government driven any way. I don&#x27;t see the point of Openreach existing as a private company, seems like extra unnecessary bureaucracy which exists purely for the dogmatic reason that private companies are supposedly always more efficient, a claim which I have never seen any serious peer reviewed research to support.<p>If anyone can explain why this is not a stupid system, then I&#x27;m all ears.",1421332436

BSD permit that changes to copyrighted work be placed under a different license. This explicit permission is why proprietary software developers like BSD/MIT licensed software, since they can do changes and then add a proprietary license to the then created derivate work. GPL do not permit this, and thus we have the difference between GPL and BSD. The question about what defines derivate work is originality, which the word &quot;small&quot; or &quot;big&quot; has no impact on. A small change to a large body of work has similar impact as a green change to a yellow body of work. Originality do not care about sizes, it cares about creativity (in the United States).<p>In the linked mailing list, there is also some discussion if an redistribution of a work can add a license without doing any changes at all, which is how the apple app store does it. Apple puts puts work that is under BSD, with no changes, and redistribute it in the app store under the terms of app store license. The legal view by most lawyer/apple/fsf and others is that apple is legally allowed to do so under BSD license, since the requirement for distribution has been followed by Apple. If there is a change in consensus regarding this, the proprietary software distributors would be the first to react and the small number of BSD work that get distributed under GPL, while still retaining the BSD notice, would be quite small in comparison.<p>The relevant part of the mailinglist discussion can be seen here: <a href=""http://openbsd.7691.n7.nabble.com/Real-men-don-t-attack-straw-men-tp55042p55384.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbsd.7691.n7.nabble.com/Real-men-don-t-attack-stra...</a>",1421332077

Taxation is unbelievably high and bureaucratic for those (like my friends) who were straight shooters and wanted to pay taxes, unlike nearly all their competition, who dodged them.<p>My favorite story was when they were trying to get internet service in Trastevere.

If you&#x27;re living off of stored wealth, you need to store it in the form of goods, not cash.  Real estate, stocks, etc.<p>There are advantages to inflation.  One is that it encourages people to keep their wealth invested in production (aside: This is also part of the economic value proposition for property taxes, which discourage non-productive land-hoarding).  Another is that it discounts debt.  Because debt payments are not inflation-adjusted and wages effectively are, making your payments gets easier over time.  This isn&#x27;t a good in and of itself, but it&#x27;s a good when considered against the alternative possibility of deflation, which tends to create insolvency among borrowers.  Of course, inflation can harm creditors who don&#x27;t factor it into their interest rate, but this is less harmful to the economy as a whole.<p>The ideal would be a money supply that exactly kept pace with growth in production resulting in neither inflation nor deflation.

Ridicule is extremely powerful (see: Stetson Kennedy&#x27;s exposé of the KKK in the 1960s) at taking down a reputable evil.<p>In the ongoing war between Frat Boys and People of Substance (aka Real Technologists) the Frat Boys have local advantage, because they&#x27;ve got better playa skillz with the VCs. It takes a continuous rash of ridicule to draw attention to the <i>global</i> concerns of technological advancement (also known as Real Technology) and keep us out of the shitty local maxima that Frat Boys tend to bring us to. If we want People of Substance to have a chance in the VC-funded world, we need a strong &quot;yellow journalism&quot; to ridicule bad actors and, thereby, clear the field a bit for the good.<p>If Ben Horowitz really can&#x27;t see this, then he doesn&#x27;t deserve to be a leading investor.

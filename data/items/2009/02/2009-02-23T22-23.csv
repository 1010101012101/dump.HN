492368,comment,491515,492103,0,0,ibsulon,,,"1. You are forgoing current wages for potential future profit. I might be willing to bootstrap a project where the first year's expectation of profit is low, but I wouldn't develop the same project for 15,000 dollars (as an example.) Are you suggesting you'd be willing to work for 30,000 dollars for 6 months? (That's for a team of 3) Oh, and that's including specs and technical documentation and test plans that many customers expect to see before deployment.<p>2. You are developing for someone else's design, which often changes midstream, and it has irrational requirements due to data flows from previous products. I worked with a product that had to support the public health information network logical data model (PHIN-LDM), an absolute monstrosity of a database. If we were building the system privately, we could have shaved the effort in half, if not more. Importing previous client data can be monstrous, due to poor system checking and user hacks to make a system do what it was never meant to do.<p>3. Deployment is more expensive. Gathering clients is more expensive. Each means traveling over to the client to gather requirements and install, and to conduct training.<p>Now, if you can do all this, there are a slew of contracts ready to happen. Get a team of three together, and subcontract out to integration teams and prime contractors. All you have to do is find a first and second project to gain momentum.",1235429890

I pretty much only ever have one task, so it's hard to find diverse things at work to flit to and from as interest dictate. This gets me pretty burnt out on 'programming stuff', which translates to (nearly) always skipping all the cool hacking stuff I have written down in my various notes/lists when I get home. I've yet to find a way around this... :(<p>2) Some things on my lists get put off a long time.

492351,comment,491923,491923,0,0,lnguyen,,,"As has been mentioned in other comments, almost all VCS allow you to change the history in some way, shape or form that probably wouldn't satisfy strict ""audit"" requirements.  There's usually a good reason for it, including one in post's author's own product.  [The usual reason is that it allows you to correct something obscenely stupid.]<p>And usually it's only available as an ""admin"" feature (at least in the commercial tools I've used).  So it's not as if it's an everyday thing developers would use or have access to.<p>The difference with Git is that you're the admin of your local repository and can pretty much do what you will with it.<p>But there's a difference between your work repository located on your laptop, workstation, etc. and the ""reference"" shared repository that's used by your team+.  So go and set all kind of hooks to prevent history rewrites (in the form on non-fast-forward pushes and the like) on it.  What happens in that case is you can mess around all you like and clean up locally but once you've decided to push up and share, your commit history isn't going to be changing.<p>+If there isn't a difference between the two repositories then either you're prematurely optimizing your development and shouldn't worry about this issue OR you've got larger separation of role issues to deal with beyond being able to change your repository's history.",1235428544

And yes, of course you can build a better UI for most of them, but that isn't really the problem in this space.<p>As a startup you face several problems if you want to get in on the enterprise market space. First of all, you're a start-up. You might go bankrupt tomorrow. Secondly, no-one else in the sector you're targeting is using you. Well, that's a no-go right there. This is a chicken-and-egg problem. Thirdly, you probably lack vendor support or recognition from analysts. Oops, you just failed the skimming test (as in 'skimming over basic requirements'). Can your product even execute in the major J2EE stacks? (Probably not).<p>If you're not 'proven' technology, then you have a hard time moving into this space.<p>And this space is not driven by user satisfaction or programmer happiness.<p>Look at how far Google has managed to move into the 'enterprise space'.

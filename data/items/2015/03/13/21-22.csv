9200355,comment,9199440,9200307,0,0,jonnathanson,,,"Smoke for smoke, cannabis and tobacco are probably equally harmful. It&#x27;s the combustion of plant matter and the inhalation of smoke, not the nicotine <i>per se</i>, that makes tobacco so harmful. The same applies for smoked cannabis, and indeed, some studies have found cannabis smoke slightly more harmful in that regard, in so far as cannabis isn&#x27;t usually smoked with a filter.<p>But unlike tobacco, cannabis does not contain a chemical as highly addictive as nicotine. Your average tobacco smoker probably smokes an order of magnitude more tobacco than your average cannabis smoker smokes cannabis. Evidently there <i>is</i> a nonzero risk of physical or psychological dependency for marijuana, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the risk profile of tobacco.",1426283949

If someone from the NYPD secretly edited a NY Times article, it would be a shock. At Wikipedia, it&#x27;s a dog bites man story, with similar things happening every hour of every day.<p>> They are also pretty bad at providing concise overviews for somebody who hasn&#x27;t been following the story since the beginning<p>I strongly agree and would go further: The Times pages you cite are inadequate to the task. They are stuck in the print media past. They should be updating their own public knowledge base; I think it would generate quite a bit of traffic on its own, and they could link to it from each relevant article to provide context (and save a few redundant paragraphs of writing in each story). Also, the way many reporters write, unaware of key developments, history, or issues, they could use it internally. I&#x27;d much rather read the Washington Post&#x27;s knowledge base page on ISIS than Wikipedia&#x27;s, for example.<p>> what do you suggest I use instead?

Let&#x27;s say your store&#x27;s HTTP requests fails and you want to inform the user (through the view component). You want to listen to yet another event from the same store to catch this? An alternative is to do exactly what you say you shouldn&#x27;t do in step 1; basically have a &quot;loadDataAction&quot; that you fire off when your component gets mounted, using some unique id or something. Prior to this action, the store will return whatever it has (synchronously, similar to what you describe). The action then handles the HTTP request. If it succeeds, it updates the store, and the listener will get the updated data (yes, I agree, the component should always have a listener to the store). If it fails, the same &quot;loadDataAction&quot; will fire off a &quot;showMessageAction&quot; which also alters some store that your component listens to that will display the error message. Typically this would be caught by some higher-up global &quot;show message&quot; component. Like most people, I&#x27;m pretty new to a lot of this as well, but I have found that trying to keep most async stuff in the actions works a lot better than async everywhere. YMMV.",1426283308

Then throw out any arguments that aren&#x27;t related to the most salient criteria and iterate. This is a useful decision making process even when you&#x27;re arguing with yourself.<p>However, divorcing advocate from advocacy is not always a good idea because it assumes everyone in the room has the same set of experiences. This is never the case; people often suggest a particular solution precisely because they understand that solution (or a proposed alternative) well enough to have an experience-backed opinion; others in the room might not have the same experience, and so are unlikely to make the same arguments for/against a solution as other team members.<p>In general, the problem isn&#x27;t argumentation. Argumentation, broadly defined, will hopefully <i>always</i> happen whenever two mutually exclusive options are on the table. It is unavoidable unless you&#x27;re willing to engineer by coin flip. The problem is ego and lack of respect and empathy.<p>When team members respect and have empathy for one another, argumentation won&#x27;t lead to these problems. Similarly, a lack of respect and empathy or an inflated ego cannot be solved by mediation of particular arguments; it&#x27;s a larger issue that should be dealt with on its own terms.",1426282041

With SHA1/MD5 etc you may only ensure integrity against random non-malicious errors.

So you decouple the hashes [h{1}, h{2}, ... h{n}] from the contents (or messages) they are derived from. [m{1}, m{2}.. m{n}) and you think you may ensure the secure distribution of the hashes without their &quot;messages&quot;. Now in recursion your new &quot;content&quot;  are now those hashes which require their own confidentiality and integrity check which may better be done using an authenticated encryption with mac. Ultimately an attacker may simply forge hashes and provide contents for them.<p>Think of 10K of linux distro files with hashes being the target of a malicious government who wants to install modified versions of those files. Only SHAx etc won&#x27;t help you to achieve &quot;integrity&quot;. At some point you need secure hashes or macs (which are hashes secured with keys).",1426281684

You are technically correct that the gap between &quot;likely&quot; and &quot;possible&quot; is decades, but that outlandish &quot;possible&quot; is, well, outlandish.<p>The difference between the 7 months Swartz was threatened with by prosecutors and &quot;50 years&quot; is the question of whether multiple CFAA counts for the same crime &quot;group&quot;. We know the answer to this: they do. Defendants convicted on multiple counts of CFAA offenses for the same underlying criminal act serve a sentence for a single count (the most severe). A judge could override this, but the onus should be on the &quot;50 years&quot; people to cite a CFAA case in which a judge has ever manipulated CFAA grouping rules to amp up a sentence. The argument seems to suggest that a judge might be so upset by Swartz that they&#x27;d <i>throw out a chunk of the sentencing guidelines</i>.<p><i>Swartz&#x27;s own attorney</i> wrote, after his death, that a conviction on all counts might still leave Swartz at a sentencing level that allowed probation: his crime was non-remunerative, the statute he was charged on is oriented heavily towards financial crimes, his primary victim was unmotivated, and he had no criminal record.<p>When Swartz&#x27;s sentence is brought up on a message board, what&#x27;s really being discussed is the nature of judicial discretion versus the federal sentencing guidelines.<p>That&#x27;s unfortunate. Leaving aside the fact that any custodial sentence for Swartz would have miscarried justice, and beyond the trauma of enduring a federal criminal prosecution, the likely guideline sentence for Swartz&#x27;s charge (if you stipulate that he was guilty, which you can&#x27;t do here) is not prima facie insane.<p>But other CFAA sentences <i>are totally insane</i>. When you handwave around Swartz&#x27;s sentence, you make it easy for people who understand (at least a bit about) federal sentencing to laugh off other CFAA sentences. But there have been recent cases in which the CFAA&#x27;s sentencing process is much more clearly unjust.",1426281556

Almost every item has some flavour text associated.<p>And, IIRC, King&#x27;s Quest has a framework pretty much similar to Mass Effect. You follow a linear path, with well crafted setpieces, but not much store about &quot;other stuff&quot;. How big is the kingdom? What to they believe in? Who was the previous king? And the One before that? Were there any wars? etc..<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Books"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Books</a>",1426281314

Further, the government is not a monolithic entity; you have the governor, various other elected officials, and then all the legislators in the assembly and state senate, plus all the people that California sends to Congress Washington DC. There are a lot of people who live in inland California whose economic well-being depends directly or indirectly on agriculture. As long as they participate in the political process, government is going to serve some of their interests because they keep electing people to vote for that.<p>This is the big trouble with libertarians right here. You  keep being politically marginalized because you don&#x27;t seem to appreciate that government is not some alien thing imposed from without, but the distillation of multiple (and often competing) collective interests. Just as &#x27;war is a continuation of politics by other means,&#x27; politics is is a continuation of business by other means.  Your &#x27;free market&#x27; solution is only going to function if you exclude a bunch of people from the political process because their continued participation has become a major inconvenience for everyone else.

As that article goes on to explain, amortized analysis is the right thing to use for figuring out the total running time of a sequence of operations.<p>Let&#x27;s be concrete.  In the case of a dynamically resized hash, the bound on an individual hash insertion when the hashing function works is O(n) because you could be looking at the unlucky insertion that resized the hash.  The amortized cost is O(1) because you get to spread that expensive resize over many individual operations.  If you&#x27;re building a hard real time system, you should focus on the O(n) and not use that data structure.  If you just want to build a hash table, the O(1) is what matters.<p>What about the amortized cost of many random hash lookups  with linked-list conflict resolution?  The distribution of buckets with different numbers of items approximately follows a Poisson distribution.  From that we can estimate the average number of comparisons.  And find out that the amortized cost is on average O(1).",1426281273

They&#x27;re not a meritocracy, and you might think that good reviews help you and bad reviews hurt you. They do/can! But it&#x27;s closer to SEO than that. Amazon ranks things by what sells, and yes, higher-ranked things sell better, but it&#x27;s more complicated than just that. Not everybody finds Perl books by looking in the Perl category. I&#x27;m looking at the third book you highlighted, about PHP. Its sales rank is 38,xxx and yours is 2xx,xxx (btw, and you may know this - the sales required to move up rankings increase exponentially, so this difference in ranking translates to quite a few sales per day). As long as Amazon believes it&#x27;s about Perl, even if only tangentially so, it will rank higher in Perl than you because it&#x27;s selling better. It&#x27;s in their interest to market what sells better for them.<p>I learned this from fiction, but it applies to nonfiction too. First of all, books are categorized by what you put in the keywords section in KDP, if they&#x27;re self-published, or by whatever your publisher put in there if you&#x27;re not. Let&#x27;s say you write a book about Perl and cooking. It may outsell pure Perl books because more people like cooking than Perl. It might be a great cooking book but a poor Perl book - or maybe you&#x27;re lying about the Perl thing, and it&#x27;s just a cookbook. But it&#x27;ll top the Perl category as long as Amazon believes you that it&#x27;s about Perl, and among the Perl books, it will have the highest sales rank.<p>Unfortunately, what I bet is happening is that this book is legitimately somewhat about Perl, and the author tagged it as such in the keywords. But its sales aren&#x27;t coming from winning the Perl category alone; they&#x27;re coming from that and PHP and beginning programming and generally from being ranked in multiple categories.<p>Your best bet to get your category back is to try to convince Amazon it&#x27;s not about Perl at all.

The fact that you are living in Spain is irrelevant.<p>There are two ways to ease the pain:<p>- Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.  See Form 2555 to determine if you qualify.  If yes, the first $100,800 of earned income (be as careful with your definitions as you would be with the programming language of your choice) is not taxed by the USA, thus making the first $100,800 of earned income taxable only by Spain. You must file a U.S. tax return to get that benefit.<p>- Foreign Tax Credit. A dollar of income is at risk of tax twice: once by Spain, once by USA. The USA gives you a tax credit (see Form 1116) for tax you paid on that dollar of income. It isn&#x27;t high precision math, but you can bludgeon the numbers to a close enough result.<p>- Use Both. You can use both. Use the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion for the first $100,800 of earned income, and the Foreign Tax Credit for earned income above that.<p>Second, Social Security tax.<p>Because you are working in Spain, you are supposed to contribute to the Spanish equivalent of Social Security.<p>You get around this by getting an exemption application via the totalization agreement between the United States and Spain.  <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/international/Agreement_Pamphlets/spain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssa.gov/international/Agreement_Pamphlets/spain.h...</a><p>This allows you to contribute to the U.S. system and not the Spanish system.<p>This exemption is typically good for 5 years with an option to extend to six years.  Then you have to start contributing to the system where you live -- they figure if you&#x27;ve been camping out that long in Spain you must really be a resident there and therefore should contribute to the system.<p>Third, getting covered by the Spanish national health system.<p>Don&#x27;t know.  I did some stuff with Spain a little while ago and my memory is that if you contribute to the Spanish social security system you get the medical coverage and if you do not contribute to the Spanish social security system you don&#x27;t get the medical coverage.<p>Fourth, what are you?<p>You are ambiguous about your relationship with the American startup. Are you an employee or an independent contractor?  Either way the result should be the same (in the long run) but the paperwork required will be different (in the short run).<p>If you are an independent contractor, permit me to make a shameless plug:  a recent blog post I did about how to be digital nomad, work abroad, and pay no Social Security tax.  <a href=""http://hodgen.com/how-digital-nomads-can-avoid-paying-social-security-tax/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hodgen.com/how-digital-nomads-can-avoid-paying-social...</a><p>Fifth, talent and cost<p>There are very few people who know this stuff well. The ones that are out there tend to be (a) overworked; and (b) expensive. Sorry. Blame your government for emulating the Byzantine<p>Empire or medieval theologians for the complexity and burden imposed on you.  If you do your tax work properly, you will probably only pay tax in Spain and pay nothing the USA. And to get there you will pay several thousand dollars a year in accounting fees.<p>My suggestion is that you practice Extreme Minimalism in your business affairs because you are far better off if you optimize for minimum tax advice expense first, then minimize tax second. :-)<p>Sixth, blowback<p>Let me just say that the biggest single part of our international tax law firm (and international tax is the ONLY thing we do) is expatriations. U.S. citizens giving up their citizenship.<p>This is especially true for Americans abroad and doubly true for American entrepreneurs abroad.<p>Disclaimer/warning shot/preemptive strike/we had to destroy the village in order to save it/etc.<p>I am an international tax lawyer. This is not legal advice to you because we&#x27;ve never met and I have no idea what is going on in your life. You&#x27;d be a damned fool to make important legal and tax decisions based on stuff you read on some random discussion board on the internet.<p>/Phil.",1426280767

The crux of the problem here is that the history of the state is all about thinking like you do -- &quot;let&#x27;s just import more water&quot; -- instead of finding ways to live within our means in terms of available water out here. So Californians like to have their own pools and like to plant grass in their yards and like to grow Rice in the freaking desert and then whine when long term drought threatens some &quot;crisis&quot; which is basically artificially created. There are lots of ways improve what we are doing without trying to import yet more water. For long term sustainability, that&#x27;s what we really need to focus on. My understanding is that the Colorado River is already so chopped up and whored out to the water needs of the west that it is a pathetic trickle, instead of a roaring river, by the time it reaches the ocean (somewhere in Mexico, IIRC).<p>There are real world limits here on &quot;just import more.&quot; And that is a big part of the problem here.

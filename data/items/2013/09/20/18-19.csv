Your defense of this is that you can&#x27;t do anything to prevent bullies or abusers. Here&#x27;s why that&#x27;s wrong.<p>1. &#x27;there is nothing that can be done&#x27;<p>There&#x27;s lots of things that can be done; they&#x27;re just not things you care about, or things you want to help with. That doesn&#x27;t mean things can&#x27;t be done.<p>We can educate people on why bullies exist, how to identify them, and how to stop them. We can show in the real world the effect of bullying, and the effect of stopping it. They do this now in small programs for some schools, but it needs to be expanded.<p>We can also lead by example. As adults (well, some of us are adults anyway) we can show bullies and victimizers that what they do is not acceptable, and we can hold them accountable for their words and actions. Not only can we address them specifically, and treat each other with respect, 45 states have laws on cyber bullying. If common human decency doesn&#x27;t work, we can report them to law enforcement.<p>2. &#x27;the bottom 0.1% of humanity&#x27;<p>Bullying exists in all walks of life in different ways. And i&#x27;m not talking elevating, i&#x27;m talking educating, and protecting other people. There is nothing wrong with trying to protect vulnerable people.<p>Why would you advocate that people should be hurt? Whether they &#x27;pretend it doesnt exist&#x27; or not, it&#x27;s still wrong, and because there&#x27;s something wrong going on, we need to work to make it right, not just throw up our hands and say &quot;oh well thats what happens when youre a hipster&quot; !!!",1379703354

The idea that only people with means have the right to have kids goes beyond unreasonable and is actually <i>inhumane</i>.<p>And women often make decisions without realizing that the men in their lives are going to run away from responsibility, get arrested, develop a drinking or drug problem, crumble under the stress of trying to raise a family, or any number of other things. So they end up getting stuck with the necessity of raising their kids on their own in poverty.<p>Except in the case of medical problems and disabilities, poor two-parent families are typically the working poor, and they tend to have houses and such, and work multiple jobs if those jobs are available, since the jobs available to the working poor typically cap out at 30-35 hours a week with no benefits.

Human walking speed alone is enough to blow the whole &quot;micro&quot; concept  out of the water.<p>Another sticking point for me is the battery life. The transmitters are touted as low energy, which they are, being able to transmit for 2 years on a watch coin battery is amazing. However, a transmitter is useless without a receiver (did the tree really fall...) and the receiver is going to be anything but low energy if has to continually scan and compare surrounding signals. Granted, my demo receiver app was as unoptimized as you can get (one day of coding plus I am not even an iOS developer) but at the same time, it didn&#x27;t do much but look for signal, and it was chomping through battery at an alarming rate. It was ok for a 5 minute demo but I can&#x27;t imagine real users would put up with this for long.<p>Given these two limitations, I have a hard time imagining wide adoption.",1379702614

During his reign it bottomed out at a couple of bucks before going back up to about $4 until the acquisition announcement. But by the time he started the price had already fallen 75%, and there was no sign of that decline abetting. The iceberg had already hit, and its name was Apple.<p>Then came the the leaked memo. That <i>was</i> a very costly management mistake, but you don&#x27;t need a MBA case study to see that, especially after Elop himself admitted it [1]. That&#x27;s like a storm hitting after the iceberg, and that&#x27;s the one Elop steered into while the ship was damaged and taking on water. But scrapping Symbian was a necessity, so the storm was inevitable.<p>However, it&#x27;s folly to think there was only one reason Nokia chose Windows Phone. Things are never that simple. It&#x27;s known, for example, that they were also actively in talks with Google but could not reach an agreement, leaving Google quite disappointed, as can be surmised from the snarky tweet from Gundotra. I can think of multiple reasons why they went with Microsoft:<p>1. Google&#x27;s &quot;Android compatibility test&quot; meant they would be forced to use Google Maps, making their own competing investment in maps useless and a complete write-off. Seeing how they are holding on to their mapping division, it&#x27;s clear they value it greatly. Worse, we see from the SkyHook lawsuit that Google captures all location data that Android phones collect to improve their maps data. So by making Android phones, Nokia would literally be helping a competitor improve their maps data. I&#x27;m guessing this was the real deal-killer.<p>2. MSFT was willing to provide the billions in cash infusion to keep Nokia on life support.<p>3. Being the flagship Windows Phone maker, they could get more leverage over Microsoft than they could get over Google.<p>4. They feared (some would say rightfully) Samsung&#x27;s dominance in Android, especially since Samsung has vertical integration that can compete with Apple, plus a humongous marketing budget.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Elop#.22Burning_Platform.22_and_Windows_Phone_strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Elop#.22Burning_Platfor...</a>",1379702504

You could find someone with any combination. My AP government class was like a cross-section of the entire school, with someone from every group, except all of us were serious about education.<p>The varsity cross country team had an average GPA of 3.8. Some might think it would be grade-inflation, but several people went to private schools (they can participate in public school sports, because their school doesn&#x27;t have a team), others took dual-credit classes at the community college. Running helped me focus, relieved stress, and gave me energy to do my homework. My grades always slipped in mid November, the only time I wasn&#x27;t running.<p>ASB, our student government, was very diverse also. We rarely put on pep-rallies. Instead, each season we held an assembly that honored every team and club&#x27;s accomplishments.<p>The point is, in my experience, the people that only participated in sports were likely to only see sports as valuable. The people that only participated in extra academics were likely to only see academics as valuable. Someone that just attended school, without doing anything else, probably wasn&#x27;t doing well in school. But, someone that participated in sports and choir saw both of those as valuable, but saw academic achievement and the competitive welding team as valuable also, because they had a different perspective.<p>It might only be the way my high school worked, but the people that participated in several different things, no matter what they were, got along better and appreciated other people&#x27;s achievements much more than those who didn&#x27;t participate in extra-curricular activities.<p>I think that everyone should try a sport, try music, try drama, compete in poetry reading, or take an AP class, etc. I know my parents required us children to always do something extra. One sister is in choir, band, and drama. One is in cross country and reads a lot. Another sister plays volleyball. You won&#x27;t be good at everything, but you will probably find something you are good at, and have a greater appreciation for what others do.<p>It&#x27;s important that these all take place in schools, and are well-funded, because schools are a place where a whole community comes together, and everyone can participate, no matter their socio-economic background.

Fund scientists who work on technologies that can detect various chemical concentrations of cells in vivo.<p>2.

Run complex big data statistical algorithms to determine quantitative measures of causation between all these chemicals and with DNA sequences in the cell.<p>4. Use this information to build an accurate computational model of a human cell.<p>This is an area of research that (1) would improve therapies across the board for all major diseases at once (2) has few short-term financial incentives, meaning only a huge research initiative could attempt it, and (3) requires significant big data expertise.<p>Thoughts?",1379701006

Also, you don&#x27;t get the benefits of such things as optional parameters in Java.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Java version of it is going to be better than any other Java web framework you ever encountered most likely (especially if everything else one tried was based in part on J2EE/JSP since Play has none of those and no XML bs config). However, you do lose some of the Scala niceties when going that route. You still can still call to Scala bits of the API in Java and templates themselves are all Scala (Lift templates), but it&#x27;s still not quite the same.<p>If using something like Intellij, you can still mix and match bits of Scala and Java in the same project (but not within the same class file) without too much trouble.

6419471,comment,6416261,6417315,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Dispensing charity on the local level, rather than the federal, reduces fraud and gets the funds directly in the hands that need it most.<p>SNAP is not charity, its a public benefit program (while charities may overlap with public benefit programs in what they do, they aren&#x27;t the same thing.)<p>Also, SNAP <i>is</i> distributed at the local level. Its <i>funded</i> at the federal level (IIRC, actually it is funded <i>in part</i> at the federal level, and there is a cost sharing arrangement), which gets resources from where they are to where they are needed.<p>> And there is a lot of fraud in the food stamp program.<p>That&#x27;s actually a separate point, from the one it is included with; please quantify &quot;a lot&quot;, and explain why this justifies throwing the baby (legitimate beneficiaries) out with the bathwater (fraudsters).<p>> One of the biggest problems the US is facing currently is the inability to pay for entitlement programs.<p>The long term costs of the major entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicare) is an issue, true. OTOH, SNAP (in total) is a negligible cost compared to those programs (SNAP has on the order of $80 billion in total costs, Social Security alone has around $1.3 trillion.)<p>> Food stamps are essentially cash. Even when spent properly, they&#x27;re usually spent on processed poor quality food because that&#x27;s the cheapest stuff around. Take the funds and spend them at soup kitchens that can leverage their purchasing power and buy high quality fresh food at a discount.<p>That would be a relevant point to debate -- not to say that I agree, but it would be at least a legitimate subject of discussion relevant to the desirability of the action -- if the House bill transferred the funds from SNAP to &quot;soup kitchens&quot;. As it does not, the idea that the money would be better spent that way is irrelevant to the legislative action actually at issue.<p>> Any entitlement programs reduces the incentive to work and become self-sufficient.<p>Entitlement programs also increase the <i>capacity</i> to become self-sufficient, whatever effect they have an incentives.<p>Incentives without capacity are meaningless.<p>(And the actual structure of SNAP generally places sharp limits on benefit duration if you aren&#x27;t actually engaged in work or job training programs.)<p>> Having been on food stamps myself, I can tell you right off the bat, it&#x27;s absolutely degrading. At the time, they didn&#x27;t use any kind of cards, you had actual food stamps. There you are, paying with stamps, while everybody else pays with cash. It&#x27;s like wearing a sign saying &quot;look at me, I&#x27;m poor!&quot; and it&#x27;s humiliating. A more discrete way of distributing help would be far more humane.<p>As you note <i>in this very paragraph</i>, a more discrete way of distributing benefits than what you experienced is what SNAP <i>is</i> now, since they no longer use stamps. (Of course, to extent that this point retains any legitimacy, it also contradicts point #4 -- being degrading creates an incentive to get off of it, financial incentives aren&#x27;t the only kind that exist; money, after all, is just a proxy for utility which, at its most fundamental level, is &quot;having experiences you prefer and not those you do not prefer&quot;, and degradation is clearly a form of disutility.)",1379700711

My reputation in this community as involved DAD who homeschools[1] his four children (my wife and I have adjusted our careers to trade off time for our children&#x27;s education) is well established here. But I empathize with your point that families even poorer than mine (my family was quite poor when my dad was slowly dying after a catastrophic injury that left him a quadriplegic for the last six years of his life) should have opportunity to learn everything that is useful for good development. One of my children received a &quot;scholarship&quot; (fee waiver) based on financial need from our local travel soccer program. I return the favor by being an active volunteer (team manager) in the program.<p>But I&#x27;m going to put it to you that you are criticizing the wrong person if you think I don&#x27;t care about good education for poor people. The FINE SUBMITTED ARTICLE talks about a poor neighborhood in Texas where academic achievement rose, and thus future opportunity for the students rose, after the high school recalibrated from an emphasis on sports to an emphasize on care school academic subjects. My big-time pet issue on HN, as is easily verifiable by looking at my user profile and my submission history and comment history, is better quality K-12 education for all learners all around the world. Children in poor neighborhoods in the United States ought to enjoy better instruction in reading, in mathematics, in writing, in history, in science, and in all academic subjects in school. I&#x27;ve posted numerous links to authoritative publications about that crucial issue. Along the way, if all young people can also learn a competitive team sport if they like, I will be glad about that. But I will be especially glad if all high school students in the United States grow up to be numerate, literate, and able to support themselves in the changing economy of the twenty-first century.<p>[1] Oddly, even though I am a dyed-in-the-wool, take-no-prisoners advocate of homeschooling, my three children who are still at home (my oldest son has grown up and is supporting himself) are this week all in their third week of full-time enrollment in public schools--the first time in twenty-one years of parenting that I&#x27;ve ever had all my children at home in public school.

Stross also got the author of the quip wrong, but I can't get my memory to produce the right one (I saw it in print many moons ago).<p>P.S. Seems Stross was right about the source. I remembered Barry B. Longyear's It Came from Schenectady.

Video content is expensive and difficult to produce because it has not become widespread enough for millions of people to actually be doing this.<p>For example, compare Word Processing to TV editing. Anybody can use a word processor on a PC...now. At the very start of things, a word processor on a PC was a specialised task. As the market grew, things became more automated and a lot easier.<p>YouTube and such are only a few years old. The software to make producing content really easy is not there yet - so there is still a lot that needs to be done manually. This software will improve and content production will get cheaper.",1241084277

Within the context of almost any content, that's unacceptable, but within the concept of a social game like mobwars -- all is fair game.<p>Yes people are making money doing low-bar / low-brow casual social network games. Why? There's no skill involved! And that's a good thing.

Note that he also got some good flack in his comments.<p>Apart from the scornful hostile tone, I don't think there's much that's technically inaccurate - it's just put in the worst possible light, like an attack lawyer would do. Which isn't really that bad: we can use a bit of critical thinking about what can <i>realistically</i> be had out of desktop virtualization, for what markets (and role vs. 'any browser + cloud apps').",1241084173

586596,comment,586406,586526,0,0,chris11,,,"I don't really see DRM as a good answer. It is usually pretty ineffective, and it can cause problems for your customers.<p>I'm not really aware of truly effective DRM. DRM just needs to be cracked once for it to be pirated. And there are people who actually enjoy cracking DRM.<p>I guess server side authentication would work, but that is only if you convinced people to connect to your servers. This is actually pretty hard. Spore seemed like it added value when it connected to the internet.  But I am sure authenticity could have easily been verified with less restrictive DRM. And cracked copies were out before retail copies were out, so DRM was a total bust in that case.<p>WOW is one of the few companies that I don't think has huge problem with piracy. But that is only because you can't pirate the experience of playing with tens of thousands of other people. And even with WOW I was able to easily find torrents of the game and lists of private servers. So even MMORPG's get pirated.<p>Big companies have thrown millions of dollars at this problem already, and haven't come up with a good solution. So this isn't an easy problem. And I am under the impression that DRM is currently very expensive for companies.<p>Sure, DRM could be made better. But I think it is kind of pointless. If the authentication relies only on hardware that is under the  users control, like a pc, it will get cracked. And you will almost certainly end up annoying your paying customers.<p>That said, I am interested in seeing how GOO turns out. A DRM solution that lets you legally sell your game sounds promising. And since Stardock built it, it might actually be customer friendly.",1241083942

586592,comment,586406,586582,0,0,JesseAldridge,,,"Yeah, probably not.  I was mainly thinking about this paragraph:<p>""I would advise any entrepreneur or investor considering content to think twice, as Howard Lindzon from Wallstrip warned us. Content is an order of magnitude harder than technology with an order less upside; no YouTube producer will earn within a hundredth of $1.65 billion. This will only become more true as DVRs and media-sharing reduce revenues and pay-for-performance ads eliminate inefficient ad spend, of which there is a lot. The main and perhaps only reason to do content should be the love of creating it.""<p>The situation just kind of sucks if you ask me.",1241083493

1798836,comment,1795409,1797898,0,0,VladRussian,,,">No, I did not. The existence of two sexes is only because of sexual reproduction. If organisms did not have sexual reproduction, and only reproduced asexually, there would not be two sexes. If something like two sexes arose in a species (i.e. one that is good at math and one that was good at cooking), it would speciate, because each ""sex"" would just keep changing individually; evolution is a chaotic process. Sexes only exist where there is sexual reproduction. The question of why  two sexes exist is absolutely about why sexual reproduction exists; two sexes exist BECAUSE sexual reproduction exists, and sexual reproduction exists BECAUSE it confers some evolutionary advantage.<p>your post again confirms my point. You're very good a ""housekeeping"" of facts, yet you miss the ability to analytically transcend beyond the mere set of facts. The sexual reproduction is the _mean_ of keeping 2 sexes from speciating, and not a _goal_ of the 2 sex existence. The 2 sex specialization inside 1 species is what confers primary evolutionary advantage.<p>>IF it were possible for a species to evolve to be ""strong"" AND division of skills produced produced ""strength"" THEN you would expect to see asexual species with ""sexes."" But you don't.<p>because without sexual reproduction the speciating happens. Sexual reproduction is a necessary mean for keeping of (and not a goal of development of) specialization without triggering speciating.",1287262162

I know some companies who ran deals through them and they produced disappointing results.<p>Any story about why the future of Twitter is commerce will have to account for that.<p>Second, there have been major changes in online commerce over the last three years, most obviously with companies like Groupon and Gilt.<p>Commercial activity on Twitter seems a little ""tabula rasa"" right now.  There are companies out there actively changing the ecommerce landscape.  Twitter has massive usage, but it's ability to augment commerce is still a promise.<p>Facebook has had a much bigger impact in online commerce.  Facebook Credits are going to be everywhere.  You can already buy them at Target, or whatever.<p>Groupon's marketing spend was dominated by Facebook ads for a long time, and they (along with Zynga) more than doubled the CPC for Facebook ads over the last two years.  There are two $1Bn+ companies built right off the back of Facebook.<p>What's the biggest company built on Twitter?  I can't think of a single interesting one.<p>The sociology of Facebook doesn't support ""commerce"" in the sense of making FB posts about things you've bought, but I don't know that Twitter does either.  So we're talking about monetizing things indirectly, e.g., running ads targeted against their ""interest graph.""  What Zynga and Groupon did were essentially find a better way to monetize Facebook users than Facebook itself had, and acquired those users by paying Facebook for the privilege.<p>It all hinges on Twitter's advertising product.  We'll see how compelling it is and if someone can build a Zynga or Groupon on top of Twitter the same way those companies were built on Facebook.",1287261873

In another cases, I've seen quite difficult abstract math classes and smart students would complain about the teacher as well - because of personal incompatibility - the teacher's style just didn't click with the student. And also, many times weak students would express a lot of respect and positive rating of a professor even though the teaching was over the top of their heads.<p>Yet obviously there were the lazy/less smart types who would just reduce the challenge to complaining about the prof - yet they are probably likely to complain about people in different situations (i.e. job)",1287261580

1798804,comment,1798241,1798241,0,0,ndl,,,"Ever since ""losing"" to Microsoft on the desktop, Apple have slowly perfected their strategy for being the smaller alternative.  They find the most lucrative niche and design to the point where they can own that piece of the market.  Built into Apple products is a sense of superiority, the feeling that the rest of the world is jealous and frustrated.  It's in their ads, and its in their users.  This has shown its effectiveness in the computer market, and it will probably make them a ton of money on the mobile scene as well.<p>But Apple didn't have to do this in the mobile world.  The iPhone was the default smartphone.  I was once talking with a rather avid iPhone user who he asked me ""what's the market for Android?""  I fina;ly convinced him that it could be everyone when I replied, ""what's the market for Windows?""<p>The iPhone is a product.  It has a target niche, a company behind it, a list of features, and everything else one expects.  Android is not - it's a platform.  The Droid is a product.  The Nexus one is a different product.  Like Windows, Android twists and bends to the offerings of each vendor.  Android has the more scalable long tail strategy - instead of trying to please your customers directly, let the market mold your product into as many forms as it will pay for.<p>I don't think that Apple have necessarily screwed up.  They may have given up the big fish, and they may have had a reason.  For one, Apple are doing what they're best at.  They also may have a strategy that integrates with the Mac.  They may also be right.  Maybe the mobile phone isn't the next computer.  Maybe it's like the iPod, best at doing one thing very well.<p>I think Apple is making a mistake in breaking developer trust.  As long as they keep market dominance, people will keep coming back to them, but as the numbers show, Android is poised to surpass.  When there are many more Androids out there than iPhones, iPhone dev is gonna be a tough sell.",1287261289

However, by default, C++ does not use it; by default, it uses ""ad hoc polymorphism"" on the static types of its arguments, including the argument passed as the implicit this pointer. In order to enable ""dynamic dispatch"", the member function you want it applied to must be decorated with the ""virtual"" keyword.<p>If someone is able to reason at the level of ""dynamic dispatch"" and ""ad hoc polymorphism"" and how to activate these features, s/he should be able to write correct, OO code on a whiteboard. However, if s/he is not formally trained in programming languages, while this person may understand this on some level in practice, s/he may under pressure lose this distinction in whiteboard code, particularly if there is no test environment available.<p>I don't honestly believe that anyone who has done OOP in C++ has never run into this, so I chalk it up to lack of formal training on programming languages.

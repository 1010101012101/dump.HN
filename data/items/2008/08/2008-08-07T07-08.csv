However, I've been testing this out a little and figure to try it on myself first (me managing me).<p>My first impression--besides idiotwork--is that they really make things simple.  They seems to be going for the twitter, microblogging style for management.  They really reduce a lot of the fat out of managing tasks and reporting.<p>I like how it just asks, ""What did you do?""  Instead of, ""what's the progress?"" ""what are your road blocks?"" ""are you sure you're not critical path?""  I'm not sure if this tool will answer those questions, but I'm not sure if they're aiming to do that either.<p>But then again, I'm not as ""time poor"" as some may be.",1218095995

269454,comment,268768,269009,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I don't think it's as ""sly"" as you make it out to be. I simply understood ""real"" work to be physical work, nothing more, nothing less.<p>Growing up, our family bought a completely gutted house -- no drywall, plumbing, wiring, nothing. One crazy summer, we did enough work to make the place livable, and in the following years, we re-sided it, fenced the property, did finishing work inside, and more. In addition to this, I had jobs (since I was about 12) mowing lawns, ""mucking"" horse stalls, siding, roofing, stocking shelves, and more that I can't recall off the top of my head.<p>To me (and I assume to anyone else who has spent years doing laborious work), this is the definition of real work. A task that works your body. Not ""real"" as in meaningful, but ""real"" as in true. Work that does not leave you stressed at the end of the idea, both because heavy exercise releases endorphins and because most of the time, your work is (temporarily) done at the end of the day.<p>Now if the original author had said ""real job"" instead of ""real work"", then I would have agreed with you. My dad did not attend college and has had a labor job my whole life. He always told me to work hard in school and to be smart, because I didn't want a job where I had to do real work like he did. <i>That</i> to me is real work.",1218094851
269453,comment,269307,269334,0,0,greyman,,,"There are also other uses. For example, I was planning to buy a new mini-laptop (MSI Wind just for illustration) and following the tweets with this keyword (via Summize search) was very valuable - you see links to new reviews almost instantly, and you can also get good impression about the product from the tweets like ""MSI Wind arrived yesterday and my wife loves it"", or ""I like the keyboard on my new MSI Wind"", etc...<p>In my understanding, the revolutionary thing Twitter did was, that they enticed users to input information, which they didn't enter into digital form before. Lot of those are just unimportant noise, but with proper filtering or searching one can extract valuable information from it.",1218094735

I still use it on a server or 2, it's got some very nice organisation not seen in ubuntu or others. Also having it compile everything should give performance gains.<p>I still like the whole use flags, rc system etc.",1218094623

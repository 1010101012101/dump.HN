4428748,comment,4428114,4428114,0,0,eduardordm,,,"It is a crime to run your own currency in all countries members of the WTO (for good reasons). You are not allowed to use bitcoins to buy or sell any product in any of those countries.<p>Also, I'm not a believer in bytes carrying out value. You see, a dollar bill is just a paper that represents a value that's not that paper. Having a serial number of a bill ""could"" be the same as having a bill itself. That makes bitcoins completely impossible to regulate, it will have life by itself. Lack of regulation is not freedom, is stupidity.<p>Economies with distinct realities cannot share the same currency or indexed currency. See Greece and Germany. Argentina and US.<p>Currencies will cease to exist. I'll not be alive to see that, but in the future there will be only XP points (just like diablo!) and maybe commodities. Currencies will slowly die out. You will be only capable of producing XP points by working, products itself will never generate XP points.<p>Maybe I'm just childish, but that's how I see it right now.

I can't find anyone who can explain to me the hows and whys of CSS without expecting me to already know CSS. So I just copy CSS that I like.<p>I've implemented Bootstrap on a new site. I see your colorschemedesigner.com link. Now, how do I get these colors from it into Bootstrap? Oh, the Bootstrap customize page. Which colors from Color Scheme Designer 3 go in which boxes? If I have to edit CSS, which files do I have to edit and why?<p>You're a designer and you think this stuff is ""easy."" Speeding up your database-centric app is easy, too. Use a proper RDBMS and correctly normalize your data. What? You don't understand? Yeah, that's how I feel when designers expect me to ""fix"" my Bootstrap-clone website.<p>Edited to add: On Color Scheme Designer, I find a set of colors I think looks nice and then look at the light and dark page examples ... and they look like ass. I have no patience to sit and find something that looks nice here and drop it in Bootstrap there and discover that it looks terrible.

Bejewelled was a big addiction for me that I noticed coming and managed to quit before I got too far in - I have [had] a tendency to get ""addicted"" to games.<p>The games provide consistent rewards. From the gamers perspective the only down side is leaving the game - you're suddenly tired, hungry, possibly feel unwell. Of course those are the symptoms of sitting on your ass all day playing video games but one isn't aware of the symptoms until one finishes playing (or later, eg trying to work on a couple of hours sleep). It seems all the emotional, adrenaline rewards are in the game and all negative feelings - pain, hunger, tiredness - are outside the game. Such feelings get amplified by having respect within a game for your position, having friends within a game, etc., if one has none of these things in the real world ...<p>I find it very easy to get in to drink.

There's no reason to ever jazz up the UI for WoW - that'd be self defeating.<p>I'd disagree, even the defaults of a lot of the custom UI add-ons were overdone and I had to scale them back. The majority of the people making add-ons aren't designers themselves, so the outcome of their efforts is going to be based on their experience or needs, not necessarily on the idea that UI should be minimal.<p>Additionally a good portion of these add-ons were made specifically to be very visible and add functionality that was either hidden or not available in the game. Screenshots from some of the top raiding guild members were overwhelmed with buttons, notifications, etc. because if your macro is good and communication is consistent, you just need to focus on these more intentionally-prominent add-ons.",1345830918

For better or worse this is an aspect that the US Government uses to uncover those operations. As we've discussed on HN before there are waaaay more federal laws than are necessary which result in making a lot of things ""illegal"" which I and perhaps others would not agree made sense ( the whole 'lying to the FBI' which is waaaaay overly broad for example ). My point is that if you ask Eric Holder or any Treasury Agent if using BitCoin as the currency for buying or selling goods or services in the US to people in the US they will say ""No, it is not."" And if you tell them you have been doing so, they may decide to arrest you at that point.<p>Policy debates (and really that is what this is) are messy and heated, but its unreasonable for a print publication to say that BitCoin is in a 'legal gray area' when calling up the Treasury would disabuse them of that notion.

4428647,comment,4428108,4428108,26,0,kilburn,,,"> Know why its important that your GET requests should always be idempotent. For example, your sign-out should only work as a POST request so that someone cannot make your users sign out by just including an <img> tag in their forum signature.<p>You got that mixed up. Idempotent requests mean that the result is exactly the same even if issued multiple times. In the case of a logout, idempotency is pretty much granted even when using GET requests. The idea here is that GET request should not change the state of the application, because the browsers are happy about opening the same URL multiple times without user confirmation. For instance, a ""post/delte/last"" URL that deletes your last post would be a terrible idea, because of the following scenario:<p><pre><code>  1. The user goes to the ""post list"", */posts*\n  2. The user hits ""delete last post"", and the web sends him to */posts/delete/last*\n  3. The user goes somewhere else, */somewhere*\n  4. The user decides he would like to go back, and clicks ""back"". His browser opens */posts/delete/last* without any warning. _Ops!_ he has just deleted another post without even noticing!\n</code></pre>\nThe <img> URL issue is a separate concern: that of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The easiest way to protect from this security issue is to require a single-use token for each request that changes the application state. You can read more about it at the Open Web Application Security Project website: <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%...</a>",1345830056

For climbing, pretty much any weight (even most muscle) is just dead weight, so climbers are as skinny and lean as any athletes out there, and I only very rarely ran into people as lean as me.<p>I've known a lot of bodybuilders and wrestlers, and even there, it's rare to see people below 3%, and I've never heard of anyone who's tested below 2% bodyfat. 1%?

4428631,comment,4427605,4428183,2,0,davidp,,,"> I think perhaps he is confusing best practices for public interfaces with general-purpose best practices.<p>Exactly.  Most of the advice in the article is sensible when viewed from that perspective.<p>I use LINQ to Entity in my company's service API.  If you fail to ""seal"" the query (as he calls it) with ToList() before you leave the 'using' block for your DB context, your callers get a runtime error later since the IQueryable isn't run until the caller enumerates it (i.e. after the 'using' block has disposed the DB context).  (On the other hand, if you call ToList() too early in your method chain, you're preventing L2E from composing your expression tree into optimal SQL, since everything after ToList() is run client-side.)<p>As an API provider you have to treat the behavior of your return values as part of the contract, and if your caller is expecting a plain IEnumerable (like you claim to return in your method signature), you'd best make sure it isn't really an IEnumerableThatDependsOnNondeterministicContext or an IEnumerableWithUnpredictableSideEffects.<p>His point is spot on about returning IQueryable only when your <i>intention</i> is for the caller to compose your result with other queries.  If you're just returning an IQueryable because you think it's cool to defer execution, you're probably missing the point.  Deferred execution isn't 100% win; you can just as easily defer yourself into a timeslot when there's <i>more</i> contention for a resource as into one where there's less contention.  In many cases it's just as well to declare your need for the data (e.g. by calling ToList() as early as possible and let the system manage the execution.",1345829931

I would recommend using the tool that is the closest to your development style.<p>If you like opinionated frameworks that make it as easy as possible to do the most common tasks (like rails), maybe you'd enjoy something like ember.js (or knockout).  For me the style closest to home is the ability to plug in My Favorite Solution to each particular problem as it arises.<p>A primary offering from backbone then is a simple structure for plugging all these previously disparate tools together, the serverside corollary to this is something like python's Flask or ruby's Sinatra where it comes with only a simple routing base and ways to plug your own components in.<p>Want to use your own templating library? Easy. Want to use your custom persistence style? No problem.

If your audience is basically anyone outside of the HN echo chamber, then default bootstrap is <i>just fine</i>.<p>I used to build big internal webapps for big companies. My design skills are only slightly better than those of a drunken orangutan.<p>After discovering Bootstrap, I used it to build a static prototype of a new system I was pitching to one of my clients.  Not only did they spend nearly 10 minutes gushing about how clean and gorgeous and minimal the design was, they approved the project immediately and suggested that I re-skin an older webapp with the same theme.<p>After I told them that I'd used Bootstrap to build the mockup, they said ""Oh yeah, I think one of our other teams is using that too.  Good stuff!""  I still got credit for being a design genius.<p>If you are building an app for attorneys, pool cleaners, CPAs, gardeners, insurance agents, property managers, window washers, dog walkers, code enforcers, self-storage facilities, mailbox companies, dentists, or payroll supervisors, then in 99% of the cases, they have <i>never even seen</i> a UI half as beautiful or usable as as the bare default Bootstrap styles.<p>Niche software is, as a general rule, <i>terrible</i>. It's clunky to use and looks even worse.<p>So, again, if you're building software for designers or people who hang out on HN all day and get annoyed by UI uniformity, then by all means invest a lot of time and money coming up with something unique.  But if you're selling to people somewhere else out there in the greater world, that time and money will be 1000x better spent in getting to know your customers, finding out how to reach them most effectively, and creating a compelling offer.",1345829879

Take a look at the Chinese book publishing industry and you'll see a glimpse of the Chinese way - most books are put online for free by the authors (mostly in their entirety).  The publishing companies pick the most popular ones, who get deals to have their books printed & sold in stores.  Totally different from the west.<p>Doing business in China, I have noticed that there is somewhat of a ""creativity gap"" (as I call it).  I believe that as their society evolves and begins to create more of their own IP, the laws will eventually adapt to protect such developments.

When pressed, the rationale generally relies on protecting consumers from fraud, and preventing money laundering and other financial crimes. Back in the mid 70's, growing up in Las Vegas, I got to experience this first hand when the Treasury Department swooped in and put a stop to people using Casino chips [1] as a casual currency.<p>However, given the way that Bitcoin works, I really wonder if governments do want to shut it down. This may be controversial but it seems with the blockchains the psuedo anonymity of bit coin that the transaction history (if its used primarily for crime) is creating something of a map of nodes as to who the 'big' guys are and who the 'little' guys are. This isn't an 'id' based strategy more along the lines of 'where has this bitcoin been' and then tracing all of them to see how they flow. If all you do is download transaction blocks once a day and note which coins have transacted, then compare that with the coins you find in the wallet of the guy you just arrested, it might leak more data than you would hope.

And its power, especially in financial matters, is global.<p>Therefore it can be analyzed as if it were a criminal actor. Does the USG have motive, propensity and opportunity to murder Bitcoin?  Sadly, the answers are yes, yes and yes.<p>Motive and propensity - obvious.  Opportunity - USG can't shut down Bitcoin trading, but it can smash the BTC price by destroying the exchangers.  If it misses one, everyone who owns BTC and sees it as an investment will rush for that exit.  Once it is closed, the price is zero by definition.<p>In retrospect, BTC will look like a very foolish bubble.  In fact it is perfectly sound from an economic perspective, but not from a political perspective - it assumes a basically fair, just and sensible global legal order.  Or at least a multipolar one.  Closing our eyes and believing these illusions exist is not an effective way to make them exist.<p>BTC is flourishing.  It continues to flourish because DOJ hasn't finished its paperwork yet.

(this is a feature, not a bug)<p>Angular.js data bindings are great and things like ng-repeat are neat until you start to step outside of the bounds of the angular garden.<p>Want to fetch data yourself and not use the angular resource plugin? (The resource plugin restricts the shape of data you can return from your server, i.e. every resource.get() request must only return a single object, if you want to receive an array you need to use .query() ). If you want to use jQuery for ajax, for instance, you lose all data bindings because vanilla javascript doesn't have the angular secret sauce! \nedit: angular provides utilities to alleviate this issue, addressed in comment below.<p>Well that's fine maybe there's an event somewhere you can hook into and trigger off of, right? Try to find this in the docs, I dare you! If this doesn't demonstrate the incidental complexity caused by using a tool like angular, consider the documentation for backbone and angular, or either projects source for that matter. You can read backbone's source in an afternoon, I couldn't say the same for angular (or ember, or knockout).  Because of this I can be confident backbone is largely bug free, I absolutely can't say the same about larger projects like angular.<p>Angular.js is meant to have a low barrier of entry, but because of this the developer interface is a thin facade on top of astonishingly complex internals. Contrast this to backbone which provides a simple and solid base for your application, providing freedom and foundation rather than a cookie cutter solution.<p>When I consider the trade-offs between client-side tools for structuring applications backbone consistently comes out on top.",1345827786

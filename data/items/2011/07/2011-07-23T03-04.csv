The ""mac"" comes in the form of a combination of software and hardware. OS X on Macintoshes is the past, iOS on iDevices is the future.  All of that is Forstall (if I'm understanding things right.)  And even then, the hardware is merely the box for the software.  They make a very great box.<p>But Forstall is the ""new jobs"" in that regard.  Ive can demand that it have fewer buttons, and Schiller can demand that marketing be on message, and Forstall has to listen to them, and if he doesn't then Cook should have their backs.  Cook is thus well placed to be the ""vision guy"" (and yes, I think that is a legitimate description and that he'd be just as good as jobs at it) whose got his finger on the daily operations but also is looking 5, 10 & 15 years into the future.<p>Apple University is the glue that holds these four guys together and keeps them on the same page.  Plus, of course, The Writings of The Chairman from Jobs over the years.<p>In fact, I would bet good money that there literally is a book within Apple, that probably only has a dozen or fewer copies, written by Jobs about the Apple Way and presenting his vision for the Apple Way.  In a way, his living will to the future.<p>I think this book is Apple's equivalent to Cokes ""secret formula"", only Apple doesn't trumpet that they have a secret formula, they keep even the existence of it secret.",1311393059

I'd also be buying (CDS) on other tipping-point countries, and watching the knock-on effect.<p>Ah : But that demonstrates how terrible CDS is, and how amoral hedge funds are.  Actually (IMHO) the fact that Greek CDS was so cheap to buy was just an indication of how little trust people have that politicians respect the law in European countries.  It would have been far cheaper to have sorted through this mess on day one, rather than spending taxpayer funds giving Greeks a lifeline when the changes that they have to make were always inevitable.<p>And now the politicians words have been demonstrated to be completely worthless, there'll be a lot more pain - in countries where it might otherwise have been unnecessary.",1311392925

You'll learn quickly where you need to be. You're probably going to be too aggressive or too timid, and the only way to learn is to get out there. I was too timid, and some girls cut me some slack...but many did not. But I don't regret being too timid (despite missed opportunities) because, well, that was me, and I had to learn those things.

The rest of us didn't know whether to laugh, or quietly tell the server to stop pouring him wine.<p>But the classic of the whole evening is when we went back out on the terrace to have petit fours.

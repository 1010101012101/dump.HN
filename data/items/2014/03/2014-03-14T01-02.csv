7396511,comment,7394828,7396083,1,0,benaiah,,,"This gets into something that I think derails a lot of debate when dealing with people of faith. Most people, including religious people, try to argue as if both sides of the argument are starting with the same assumptions, when they&#x27;re really not. If they accept the same premises for a specific argument, then sure, they can have a meaningful debate about it, but if they don&#x27;t, and they <i>very frequently</i> don&#x27;t when it comes to debates involving people of different faiths (including atheism for the sake of semantic convenience), then the debate will just be a shouting match. This idea is often referred to as <i>presuppositionalism</i>, that people have fundamentally different, and frequently irreconcilable, ways of looking at the world, and any argument where the arguers have different presuppositions is therefore futile.<p>This is relevant, because it seems that the system you propose would make presuppositions very explicit, which would help people with different presuppositions to realize why they are disagreeing instead of just yelling at each other till they go hoarse. It sounds like a very cool system, and I&#x27;d love to see it in action.",1394762375

My experience has been that roads with bike lanes tend to be more dangerous - cars stop paying as much attention to bikes, so you get a lot more instances of them forgetting you&#x27;re there and making a right hand turn right in front of you.   Not to mention that they often force cyclists to ride within swinging distance of car doors - which is a far more popular way to injure cyclists than actually running into them is.<p>My preference would be to have designated bike thoroughfares where cars are permitted, but the speed limit is kept to something low enough that cars and bikes are going at approximately the same speed so bikes can ride in the lane without (reasonable) motorists feeling obstructed.",1394761921

In that case I&#x27;m not following it very well.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any &quot;statistical significance&quot; (using the term loosely) in the failure of Lisp, Smalltalk, or any other language to become a big success. There are too many non-technical and historical factors that can easily explain all these outcomes. Meanwhile the sample sizes are so small—consider how short the list would be of all programming languages that ever had a major turn at bat—that we have no way of drawing true conclusions about this.<p>For example, it&#x27;s easy to make a case that Smalltalk lost to Java because (a) the Smalltalk vendors were short-sighted and (b) Java was magically &quot;the internet language&quot; just when the internet was everything new and important. Those are historical accidents that had nothing to do with abstractive power.<p>A word about the &#x27;antisocial&#x27; argument, which I think is deeply wrong about both Lisp and Smalltalk.<p>It&#x27;s true that Lisp and Smalltalk let you define &quot;if&quot;. That&#x27;s a measure of their power. But anyone who thinks that Lisp and Smalltalk programmers willy-nilly define &quot;ifs&quot; all over the place (or do anything at that level very often) does not understand the culture of these languages. There <i>are</i> many examples of such willy-nillyness, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a phase most programmers seem to go through with this stuff. (I did.) Experience teaches you to be more discerning, and culture, when you&#x27;re lucky enough to be exposed to it, accelerates experience.<p>Thus the solution to the misuse of abstractive super-power is culture and community, which work perfectly well in both Lisp&#x27;s and Smalltalk&#x27;s case, as their long historical records amply show. A friend of mine was part of the later wave of Smalltalkers in the pre-Java days, and he talks fondly both of how much he learned from the older Smalltalkers (over BBS mostly, since he grew up in a small town) and also how the community as a whole gradually learned to use the power of extending the language well—as well as what to avoid. So it&#x27;s wrong to attribute some weird anti-social property to these languages. There&#x27;s even a vibrant counterexample going on right now in Clojure.",1394759097

Now, almost 10 years later, it stands on its own and I believe we&#x27;re building quality solutions and have a really good team of people here.<p>The problem is we compete against companies that build on top of things like Joomla etc where the design details are lost, the functionality is often fudged and the customer never has complete ownership of the system.<p>But when that is $20k and we are $40k, the customer often doesn&#x27;t see the value up front. We have however had a number of customers come to us after being stuck with horrible CMS systems that promised all the functionality they wanted but were impossible to use easily and clunky.<p>In my opinion, we should be emphasising quality, attention to detail, openness (in that we build on open platforms and the customer has the code/database at the end of the day) and technical know-how.<p>I also wondered whether it&#x27;d work better to split off a company just for the web because the a split message is always going to make marketing harder when you&#x27;re using a single website?<p>Sorry this is a bit messy, I was basically hoping to hear from people in similar markets about what has worked and what hasn&#x27;t.",1394758809

I can't find it but some Google-Fu might get you there.<p>What I disagree with is where he says: ""almost all the profits go directly to the author. I'm not optimistic this will happen any time soon."", which is interesting. Technically there's a few authors who've been self-made, self-published successes through the Kindle store. You lose a percentage to Amazon so can we class them as a publisher? You could chose to sell an ebook directly to your audience as a few people have tried (and have been successful, there's been a few posted on here I've ended up buying very happily).<p>Publishers at the moment are a necessary evil. Traditionally they publish your work, handle the distribution and all the stuff that's basically not the writer sitting their ass down and writing. Digitally they seem to have filled a similar role of providing a digital shelf space, dealing with payments, hosting and so on. Until it becomes completely trivially to write it, host it, charge it and deliver it they'll be needed.",1341997062

It's kid-friendly, and after people laugh at it they'll remember it because it's an unusual name for a company. It's very personal.<p>I think about names a lot. I'm too tired now to dig up my old posts about it, but what your existing pool all have in common is that they're trying to describe what sort of company you are. This is not what a name is for - a few companies do have such names, but they tend to be first-in-market ones like Electronic Arts. What you want from a name is stickiness. It doesn't have to explain anything: it has to provoke people's curiosity.<p>I was one of the few nerdy people to get the pun in 'Google.' But that didn't matter - the first time people heard the word, there was no way they could forget it. From your short list of aspirational names, I feel like your company should be called Brian.<p><pre><code>  'What's the name of your company?'
  'Brian.'

I gave you as much the benefit of the doubt as I could, so it really shakes me up that after all that effort, you take my points, twist them to make me look like a fool and use them to reinforce the one core point which I agree with you on: that there are a lot of practical issues that need to be addressed before this has a good shot at success.<p>I tried to give a reply you'd really appreciate and you punched me in the gut with it.

He visualizes his inbox as a disastrously bad todo list and email as the way things get into it. He shared his thoughts on what may be a better solution that can eventually replace email. Here are some points from that :<p>1. Email has to be replaced with a new protocol. This new protocol should be a todo list protocol, not a messaging protocol.<p>2. The new protocol should give more power to the recipient than email like<p>a)more restrictions on what someone can put on my todo list.<p>b)Information about what action I need to take on a to-do list item. Like, do I need to read something or take any further action on it like replying, forwarding, viewing attachment, paying attached bill, watching video etc. ?<p>c)How important it is? There obviously has to be some mechanism to prevent people from saying everything is important.<p>d)When does it have to be done? Is it urgent? Do I need to do it before a given time?<p>----------------------------<p>I would like to ask some questions about it from both PG and HN community :<p>1.

What other actions you think that should be incorporated in new to-do list based system?If not all, what are the important ones for you?<p>2. How would you like to prioritize to-do items by importance? What are the rules? Like, giving importance to to-do items from specific ""circle"" of peoples you know - Colleagues, family, etc.? or by type/content of to-do item? or anything else?<p>3. What kind of things one can put on your to-do list? What kind of things one shouldn't be allowed to put in your to-do list?<p>4. Do we really need a new protocol? Can't it be done by making a distributed client/server system where anyone can setup an open source to-do list server(if they need to own and control their information for privacy reasons) and clients can communicate through HTTP protocol (REST API)?<p>5.

It's an idea, not a fully fleshed out proposal.<p>First, people can give directed donations if they like.<p>There would be multiple funds, so presumably the funds would differentiate based on genre. And people would sign up for the funds that have the type of entertainment and art (or even lectures) they prefer.<p>Everything here is completely voluntary. The funds would act as agents, and advertisers.<p>A fund would attract a performer based on how good a job the fund does on getting that performer an audience. A performer would attract a fund based on how happy people are with the performer. People would sign up with a fund based on the quality of the performers.<p>So if a performer is not happy with his cut of the donations they would find a different fund. If a fund is not happy with how many people are donating they would try to find better performers. And if the donors are not happy with the types of shows they would find a different fund.<p>So the incentives are all aligned properly. (As long as people are actually willing to donate.)<p>It would probably require some fine tuning to get it right.

Now, I don't want to say you <i>have</i> to spend a lot of money to get a good vacation--you don't. But it does create more options, and some of the things I really love (like travelling to Europe) have fairly high barriers to entry.<p>So having somebody allocate the funds for me makes it much more likely that I'll spend them on something exciting and enjoy myself with it. I suspect the sort of people working at a company willing to pay you $7500 for a vacation don't need to worry about paying the bills <i>too much</i>, but there is still an incessant nagging to be economical.<p>I was actually originally thinking about this idea in a completely different context. There is a nice parallel between this and the sorts of prizes you get at hackathons (usually electronic gadgets): in a certain sense, that prize is worth more than its price because I would not have spent my own money to buy it. It's slightly weird logic, but I think it's accurate: there's a big psychological difference between opportunity cost and actual cost. Sure, I could have $500 instead of a tablet, but if I'm just going to win something, I'd rather it be the tablet.<p>In short: I think this scheme is a good way to overcome my innate resistance to spending money on things that seem to be a ""waste"", even if I would enjoy spending it that way and probably get higher utility than just by saving it.",1341995415

Since there is no benchmark, I have no idea what is considered 'acceptable' time off.

Maybe use something that ships as OEM boards for faster time-to-market, and to avoid the hassle of sourcing manufacturing.<p>I know you could publish HTML5 games on OUYA using one of the many frameworks available, but it would be nice to completely sidestep Android and have a more focused and independent platform.<p>What do you think?",1341993697

The whole ""war drives tech"" idea is fueled by the idea that war causes society to funnel cash towards a singular purpose... RADAR, Manhattan Project, NASA, etc. Nowadays we are still spending a <i>ton</i> of money on the military, but think of what that spending would be like if WW3 were to break out (barring nuclear holocaust). That's the generic idea behind the 'war <=> tech' relationship.",1341993678

Think about it, science can tell what happens billions of killometers away and what happens in subatomic scale and it can't find out how human body works enough to cure most common diseases? It doesn't convince me.<p>And why not to believe? There are many people doing bad things. There are wars, animals are treated like garbage. Why not to believe someone want to make bussiness on disieses?<p>How about remissions, why nobody believe they occur for a reason? People are too stupid to find out that reason? I don't think so. Or maybe am I wrong and scientists try to find out why they happen?<p>Why basis of caring about health in mainstream medicine now are meds and vaccination and not healthy diet and doing sports? I use no drugs and I don't get sick. I used to, before i started to care what I eat and what I do for my health. Noone ever told me to do what I've done. I rather seen commercials of drugs that are not healthy and not realy work.<p>Does anyone care about that psychedelic drugs relieve cluster headaches (where no other good working med is known)? Anyone cares MDMA decreases symptoms of Parcinson disease? Is it so difficult to find out why? I mean, if anybody except single scientists care? I don't mention how great can they impact on state of mind.<p>Hemp is great painkiller, medicine for insomnia, and others. Why I can't use it to relieve my pain or to help myself fall asleep? Why medicine use much more dangerous drugs if hemp could be used? As far as I know It's illegal because someone don't want to admit it's useful for medical reasons.<p>Medicine is so broken. For me someone want it to be broken or people in medicine are stupid. I can hardly believe they are so stupid so I'd rather believe second option. The fact that some people always wanted to enslave somehow other people. We had explicit enslavement and religion. Why medicine wouldn't be next one?",1341993654

Under your model, the punk performers would make $1980 and the classical performers would make $20 - right?",1341993646

At Mandalorian we do 30 days a year plus 1 extra day per year of service. Most people at Mandalorian don't use all the allowance (mainly because we're results oriented so people routinely check out during the day to drop kids off at school, pick them up etc.), but seem to be comfortable with the fact that they can take time off when they need/want to.<p>When people go on holiday, they generally disconnect here although some people will take phones etc. I've just come back from 8 days on a remote island in the sea of Marmara with a couple of days in Istanbul and my total contact with work (as the owner) was two text messages and one email on the way to the airport.<p>I have American friends who tell me that when they go on holiday they have to take their laptops and phones with them, and routinely take calls and do conference calls during their holiday, which sounds insane to me but each culture has it's own nuances.<p>If this is doing something good for American workers then I'm all for it, but I can't help but think that if I were in their shoes I'd say keep the $7,500 and double the holiday allowance.<p><i></i>EDIT: Thanks to willholley below for pointing out that the minimum entitlement includes bank holidays, as seen here: <a href=""http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/employment/employees/timeoffandholidays/dg_10029788"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/employment/employees/timeoffandh...</a>",1341993631

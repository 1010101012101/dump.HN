I have trouble understanding the mixture of &#x27;tribal&#x27; traditions (and the notion of tribes, as far as I understand the matter of &#x27;how to be Jewish&#x27;) and believing in God with a rather strict list of rules.<p>> Even when you meet up with Jews whose practices are different from yours, the feeling is one of mutual respect<p>That .. is a bit over the top, no? I mean, no group works like that and my experience of the people in Israel is no difference. This breaks down rather quickly, if I think of coworkers and friends telling me that they don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; orthodox Jews and even - that was a big one - often ask airlines to make sure not to sit next to one during a flight. That&#x27;s Jew vs Jew in the same country here. I mean.. I guess I just want to express my doubts at your happy &quot;one family&quot; explanation here, without bashing anyone.<p>The anecdotes above just cement my point: Is it a religion? Doesn&#x27;t seem that way, but most rules and traditions are based on what I&#x27;d consider a religious base. A nation? Hard, because there wasn&#x27;t a united nation for quite a long time. Tribe? Well, ignoring the problem w/ believing that the tribes described in some book are real and somehow continue to exist until today, how do you cope with people that convert to Judaism? People abandoning the faith and becoming - for example - Christians? How do you rationalize the matriarchal way of automatically &#x27;being&#x27; part of the team? And if you look into the biggest country of Jews today, could you stuff a young gay boy from Tel Aviv in a room with a representative of Bnei Brak&#x27;s population and get a consensus on what it means to be Jewish?<p>No bashing intended. Seriously. I&#x27;d love to move back or return for lots and lots of trips. The language is awesome, I fell in love with the country. But .. the identity is a mystery to me and sometimes it seems that the internal view isn&#x27;t thaaat much clearer (as above: Just pick a number of people from the quite diverse pool of people).<p>1: And I miss it.

I view it as highly disrespectful, especially since I have more than enough open source work out on GitHub.<p>I also do not wish to burden candidates with that when I interview them.  I believe I am a good judge of character, and also a good judge of ability, so I haven&#x27;t felt the need to offer a project after a phone screen or in-person.  I do not even plan out the questions I ask except for having a loose set of criteria I look for when I interview a candidate.  It is much easier if the conversation is fluid, as if between peers.  That does not mean I won&#x27;t ask difficult questions - sometimes I do, but I ask them depending on how the conversation goes and what the developer comes off as to me.  My questions are meant to gauge the candidate&#x27;s skill level, and whether there is a good fit for the company and candidate.  I don&#x27;t need to give the a super hard brainteaser - that only serves to filter for the exceptional, and isn&#x27;t an efficient use of time.  I don&#x27;t need to give FizzBuzz - if I am that suspicious of a candidate, I will cut the interview short, since within the first 5-10 minutes, I already have a general hypothesis formed that I am testing for.<p>I like to open up interviews with asking about the candidate to explain his/her background.  I will have read the resume beforehand, or read it while the person is giving the overview, to see if the person misrepresented anything on the resume or about his/her background.  I ask about details about some recent experiences, and if it is the technology that my company uses, I ask for the candidate&#x27;s views on the technology, including positives and negatives.  I shift over to questions about beliefs on how the candidate approaches certain situations, or shift to the technical questions.  I don&#x27;t require exactness in answers, but if a candidate has an exact correct answer, it&#x27;s a good sign.  Similarly if I ask a trickier question and the candidate figures out how to answer it optimally quickly, it&#x27;s a huge positive - you can&#x27;t fake that sort of cognitive reaction.<p>Lastly, I save some time for the candidate to ask questions - even this is a part of my evaluation process, because more senior candidates know what type of questions to ask based on what they have seen in the industry.<p>For me, this has been enough for me to evaluate a candidate properly.

It&#x27;s a reminder that there&#x27;s a non-conceptual aspect to life—a way to be that doesn&#x27;t involve categorizing or evaluating, just acting and experiencing. &#x27;Body scan&#x27; meditation and breath watching are both great for this. It&#x27;s like some deeper, unseen part of mind chooses at any given point whether to exist as that voice in your head, or your physical body. For me, exercising ambition and over-focusing on intellectual pursuits for too long made it so that I was pretty much exclusively identifying with the &#x27;voice in my head.&#x27; It sounds like I&#x27;m describing some inexact fluffy sort of thing, but I have something very definite in mind with this description: my subjective experience is starkly different based on whether I&#x27;m in the physical or mental &#x27;mode.&#x27; And this is not a special insight of my own; their are plenty of ancient and modern treatments of the problem of thinking you are your thoughts.<p>And, I&#x27;m pretty sure that understanding how to move between these modes is a key aspect to cultivating &#x27;flow&#x27; in programming (or other activities).<p>I&#x27;m still relatively new to meditation (about 1.5 months regularly; over a year reading about it and doing it occasionally), but I&#x27;ve reaped definite benefits from the time I&#x27;ve put in. It feels like the descriptions in &#x27;Flatland&#x27; of discovering there&#x27;s a new dimension that you can move in: without meditating it was like I was constrained to endlessly following up whatever thoughts I started up, and now I&#x27;m getting better at simply stepping aside when I can see it&#x27;s no longer productive.<p>This has been especially important for me since I&#x27;d had an injury related to using mouse/keyboard so that it became impossible to &#x27;get out of my head&#x27; while using the computer—was in the polar opposite of &#x27;flow&#x27; whenever on the computer. I spent a couple years like that, in one sense relieved since I understood rationally that I wasn&#x27;t damaging myself at the computer anymore—but still having a terrible time at the computer because of past experiences with it. There were a number of things that went into improving this, but things didn&#x27;t start reaallly getting good again until I started meditating. The feeling is like learning an instrument though: I can see myself slowly becoming capable of making music—but it takes time.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m really all that much of a special case though. People are in their heads in an unpleasant way while coding because any number of things causes them anxiety: anything from finding yet another bug in your code to general unease from a built up habit of assessing your supposedly innate capacity as a programmer. If you have no concerns, you just act: it&#x27;s just the code and the problem you&#x27;re working on, everything else disappears, time disappears. If you can do it with the breath, you can do it with code.<p>edit: for typos, expanded a couple parts.",1426977620

9244462,comment,9240221,9242604,0,0,saalweachter,,,"Well, you have to be careful where you place your skepticism.  Some science is complex, but some science is simple.<p>So when most people -- including most experts -- say &quot;global warming&quot;, they&#x27;re referring to the observed and predicted increase in the average temperature measured at the surface of the Earth.  The observed trend, both the direct measurements and the inferences made about historical temperatures, is pretty solid science.<p>But there&#x27;s another way to think about global warming, and that is the heat content of the Earth.  The Earth generates a little bit of heat itself, from its radioactive core, receives a boatload more from the sun, and then radiates most of it off into space.  And we&#x27;re also pretty confident that a little surplus is left over.  That little surplus of heat goes to heat the oceans, melt the ice caps, and also towards the atmospheric heating that we commonly refer to as &quot;global warming&quot;.<p>Now, this underlying change in heat content is relatively simple.  It&#x27;s a lot of work to measure -- you need to keep track of how much ice there is, measure the temperature of the oceans at various places and times and depths, track atmospheric temperatures.  It&#x27;s also not guaranteed to be constant -- if the albedo of the Earth changes (like through there being more or less ice, or lots of dust going into the air) or the composition of the atmosphere dramatically changes, Earth will gain or lose heat at a different rate than it is now.  But it&#x27;s still relatively simple.<p>Where it gets complex is how this change in the heat content of the Earth relates to climate.  There, you&#x27;ve got a million variables.  If the oceans heat faster or slower, the atmosphere will heat faster or slower.  If it affects wind currents, you can get warmer or or colder air pushed into places it doesn&#x27;t normally go.  If it affects the ocean currents, the climate in some parts of the world could get dramatically colder, even as the heat content of the Earth continues creep up.  If it somehow magically melted all the ice first, without changing the surface or ocean temperatures, you&#x27;d have no climate change at all for about a thousand years, but the oceans would rise dozens of feet over that same time.  If the atmosphere heats first, the climate would get dramatically worse but the ocean levels would stay the same.<p>So I think it&#x27;s quite reasonable to be skeptical about any specific predictions of how the climate or the conditions on Earth will change as the Earth continues to warm -- that is complex.  But I hope you aren&#x27;t terribly skeptical that the Earth <i>is</i> warming, that its total heat content is going up -- that is much simply, much more definite.  It may not be certain how this will affect the climate, but so far none of the options look good.",1426977039

The trick isn&#x27;t any preprocessor abuse, pointer-math problem, or any of the usual places in C where the complexity can easily obscure what is really going on. The program uses several idiomatic construct like<p><pre><code>    for(c = buf;*c;c++) { ... }
</code></pre>
to walk the PPM data. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. (output black (zeros) for pixes in a given region.<p>To find the problem, you have to understand the entire problem <i>and the written algorithm</i>, as this isn&#x27;t a &quot;bug&quot; - it doesn&#x27;t implement the spec properly. It walks char by char - which looks fine at first - but that means it zeros &quot;1 12 123&quot; into &quot;0 00 000&quot;, leaking the contrast of the original data.<p>I find that this is an important lesson to remember: no tool can catch you using the <i>wrong algorithm</i>, especially when the code &quot;mostly&quot; follows the design requirements that can never cover every possible corner case. Tools can catch interesting problems, but the inherent complexity in software says that you can never <i>really</i> be sure what a program does until you&#x27;ve read an understood the whole program... which isn&#x27;t possible in the general case (halting problem).<p>So we can only hope to try and keep everything as simple as possible... as this winning entry shows that even 55 lines of clean code are enough complexity to hide what could be malicious code.",1426976489

This works well for static content like lyrics of a song, text in some literature etc. I got curious what something like this might look like for code and after a cursory google, I stumbled upon Omniref, which looks like they&#x27;re targeting this exact problem. Of course, they&#x27;re aiming to provide a very comprehensive solution that scours and indexes the web to surface code that can be annotated. AFAIK, their solution works for Ruby and more recently Javascript.<p>I&#x27;m curious if this could be packaged as some github plugin that is language agnostic. Think of it as a persistent Q&A that holds a &quot;conversation/discussion&quot; on specific lines of code. Naturally, this feature is available when you send a PR to start a discussion, but once the PR is closed that&#x27;s the end of the discussion. One problem code presents that other literature doesn&#x27;t is the fact that it tends to be less static (i.e. code keeps changing over time whereas lyrics to a song may not.) If there were an elegant workaround to this problem (where prior versions of a line of code and its Q&A is cached so that an interested user could view what the past conversations were) I&#x27;m tempted to say that this could really streamline the learning and collaboration process when it comes to using/writing code.<p>Anyone here play around with this idea in the past? If so, I&#x27;d love to hear your stories. If not, anybody interested in joining me on hacking some POC up to see what this could end up looking like?",1426976016

As an example, Erlang (and later Go) has been used to write &quot;reactive&quot; software with neither a hint nor a mention of callbacks, promises or observables (at least for the purposes outlined in this text).<p>Those concepts are mere implementation tricks designed to circumvent blocking in environments that either don&#x27;t have support for multi-threading at all (which makes blocking impossible if concurrency is to be maintained), or those where threads are necessarily kernel threads (where blocking entails a significant overhead). In fact, the whole notion of non-blocking is entirely accidental to the discussion of responsive/concurrent applications. Where lightweight threads are available (and, therefore, blocking is free), those design patterns are completely unnecessary for writing responsive software, and, in fact, make it quite cumbersome.<p>Callbacks, promises and observables obliterate stack traces, make concurrency opaque, require explicit back-pressure as well as a complete &quot;shadow&quot; implementation of error handling and control structures beyond those provided by the language. They would all be considered anti-patterns[2] if they weren&#x27;t a necessary last-resort workaround to the problem of expensive blocking (which happens to be not too hard to fix by other means).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming</a><p>[2]: At least in non-pure languages.

One of the techniques we have to manage this complexity is to break the program into components, smaller pieces that couple to each other loosely. This limits the impact of a change, since a change in one component is less likely to require changes in other components. At least that&#x27;s the hope.<p>There&#x27;s lots of ways to decompose a program, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. MVC is a particular decomposition that is useful for interactive applications. The components are named Model, View, and Controller. An example of an advantage of this decomposition is that you can apply a different user interface (e.g. a command line one) by exchanging the View, without needing to change the Model.<p>Other answers here have focused on MVC as it applies to web development. But MVC is from the 70s, predating the web by many years! If you look beyond the trend, you see ideas rooted in an effort to architect software well, and see MVC as just one design, one particular decomposition.

It also has implicit conversions and other oddities which mean that code often keeps on trucking after a programmer error, rather than failing where the initial problem was.<p>These problems were solved in other languages decades ago - which is why many developers &quot;hate&quot; switching to Javascript. It&#x27;s coding on a tight-rope without a safety net.<p>The meme: &quot;You&#x27;re just a hater, because you don&#x27;t know how to use it&quot;, is a joke. Javascript has issues, hopefully they can be fixed, but fixing them without breaking compatibility is difficult. Being honest about Javascript&#x27;s flaws doesn&#x27;t make you a &quot;hater&quot;.<p>For the record my first JS project was Netscape 2 compatible. So I&#x27;m pretty sure I know how to use it.",1426975205

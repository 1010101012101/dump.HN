They proudly display this mistake twice!  For another thing, what sort of idiot would configure the case as a stand then type on it in portrait orientation?  Answer: the review author(s)!<p>If you want to type with the case on, do so in landscape.  If you stand the unit up on the small side of the case with the flap tucked in to make a stand, it's perfect to use with the Apple Bluetooth keyboard.  Since the case was never set up properly, the reviewers wouldn't have been able to figure that out.",1270713485

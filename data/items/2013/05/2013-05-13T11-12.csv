But I'm not OK if the argument made lacks basic human dignity.<p>> (where's the blood ? I hear even muslims have blood. And ahem, all muscles relax, which would color such an immaculate burial cloth yellow and brown for reasons I won't go into, again where are those discolorations ?)<p>Yes, they dirtied and wrapped a living child in a cloth to stage a dead child and forgot to simulate piss and shit stains necessary to pass your analysis. Huge slipup on their part. Not possible that a parent or relative would first take care to ensure the dignity of their child to remain intact before bringing them out to show their grief in front of their community.<p>> And frankly a corpse 3 days old smells to the point that no emotion will allow you to ignore that<p>You might be surprised.<p>There are stories around of mothers tending to their stillborn fetus for <i>weeks</i>.

And they will also be put in a position of selling themselves short by comparing themselves with western Europe or US schooled people (the guy with a diploma from a fancy US uni will have the guts to ask for far more than someone with a diploma from an Indian uni, even if he is less competent! ...and this is the best case scenario: if, let's say, a Harvard schooled guy is stupid enough to ask for less than he's worth, anyone else will have to make do with even less than he does!) and they will accept worse deals. And that's the danger I'm talking of: <i>this will make all employers expect more for less, from everyone!</i><p>About (4), indeed, having a family to take care of greatly restricts your mobility (and I bet this is what the guys doing US immigration policy bet on!) - but you can avoid the issue before it happens: take a better look at other options besides US as most EU countries have more flexible VISAs and such (yeah, having to speak German - Berlin area seems to be shaping up as Europe's SV nowadays - and French and maybe Spanish or something else fluently on top of English is hard, especially for techies with not so good language and social skills, but it opens up a lot of doors and gives you more bargaining power for yourself).",1368446139

If not, can you please explain further. Are you aware that 50 years ago women faced massive discrimination and that this may still be having a lag effect today? Have you heard of stereotype threat enough to convince someone who believes in it?<p>You are being condescending and rude and seem to expect your audience to share your conviction in a fringe view of genetic determinism. Nobody is disputing men and women are genetically different. That this change extends to neurological changes should hardly be surprising. Different machinery require different control structures. The scientific debate is on exactly how significant these differences are compared to other factors that have significant influence including the culture.

And even if everybody was terribly offended by that, what are they going to do? They're pretty much locked in at this point.</i><p>Bloomberg are playing with fire here, partly because they're almost a monopoly, and partly because they could be so easily replaced on the quotes side (if not on the financial news market side). Technology has moved on and exchanges are more open with data than they used to be, and this is probably only going to continue - I'm sure they'd love to cut Bloomberg out of the picture and charge their own fees separately.<p>There is no justification for Bloomberg journalists to be poking into private account information about Bloomberg clients - the potential for abuse of this position is huge, apart from anything else the journalists could use it for insider trading, which is of course illegal. They could also take information from one trader and sell it to a competitor, there is huge scope for abuse, and the only way to avoid it is to have very clear (and tight) boundaries for the usage of stats collected.<p>In the same way that newspapers have a firewall between editorial and advertisers, to try to stop advertisers influencing editorial, Bloomberg should have a firewall between the division which sells financial information and that which investigates financial news in order to get that information. I find it astonishing that so many people are defending this sort of privacy invasion as standard practice. It's not acceptable to use information such as queries and logins to measure specific individual actions and find out (for example) how active a particular trader has been in a certain market, then spread that information. It's fine to keep these stats and anonymise them in order to generate statistics about usage, but quite another thing to use them to track individuals and trading patterns. If Google for example used the content of private emails from a CEO to target companies to sell adverts to, there would be outrage, and rightly so.",1368445707

So if you can manage to keep the error rate low enough, then everything will be fine.<p>If it turns out that the error rate depends (for physical reasons) on the the size of the system, then for some size of QC, adding error correcting q-bits will be counter-productive. Given that (in public) no-one has made a QC with more than a handful of coherent q-bits, no-one really knows where the limits are: it might well be that error-correction lets you build arbitrary sized coherent QCs, or there might be insurmountable physical limits that prevent that from happening.

Should be able to open invites for the reader part in a month or so.<p>The crawler collects lots of metadata from content. The vocabulary engine is part of a planned down-the-road feature that will provide additional metadata for crawled content, as well as eventually help users find other users that write comments they want to read. (It has an ""anti-social"" aspect planned, where user interaction will be allowed on reader content, but the software will encourage users to form loose-knit groups of around 20 or so.)<p>I think the number one problem of social networks right now is that they try to grow without restraint and force hundreds (or thousands) of people to all interact. But humans aren't wired like that; we don't do that well. What <i>does</i> seem to work well is LiveJournal-style communities, or the BB communities, where people get partitioned off into smaller groups by common interests, with other people crossing between interest groups.<p>I'm not super excited about the community stuff though. The NLP work has been a blast so far, the interpreter I wrote seems to be working out well. I took a somewhat naive, very clean approach to NLP, and I think it'll support up to a few thousand different types of metadata (I can't even imagine that yet) and at least as many different phrases. I have a little more mostly front-end work to do on the reader, then after that I'll start working on providing direct access to the search engine behind the reader. (The reader isn't an RSS reader, it's a search engine interface that lets you use the results from searches as news feeds -- like, right now I have a ""front page of HN"" news feed. Reddit content is also being crawled, I just need to edit the parser to accept a query like, ""front page of HN and r/technology and r/startups"".) Eventually I'll mess around with the community part.<p>So, for example, users with an account on the reader (and, later, the search engine) might have articles closer to their own reading level get a mild rankings boost.",1368444801

Also would those people behaving against islam's principles be in a large angry mob on the streets of Gaza ? I mean, that is avoided by most pious muslims in Gaza I hear).<p>Where are the wounds ? A bombardment kills by using shrapnel - lots of it - as bullets, or by crushing. Obviously these children haven't been crushed. The right child's face is full of sand, but the white burial clots is immaculate. They are lying flat ... euhm ... how did that happen ? (In case you don't know there's a reason they call a corpse ""a stiff""). If they died through bombardment they wouldn't have been lying, they would have been curled up. Since nobody collects dead bodies immediately after a bombardment (would have to be in 2 hours or less), they would experience rigor mortis in the curled up position. At that point the only way to get them into a lying position would be to break all of their bones, which takes time and a lot of effort. The bodies in the picture are obviously not experiencing rigor mortis, they are flexible and move with the arms of those men ... so what is it ?<p>Either these kids died in the last 60 minutes before the picture was taken (where's the blood ? I hear even muslims have blood. And <i>ahem</i>, all muscles relax, which would color such an immaculate burial cloth yellow and brown for reasons I won't go into, again where are those discolorations ?). Furthermore the eyes wouldn't stay closed. Or they're past rigor mortis, dead for at least 3 days ... so why is there skin wet ? Why is there no loss of skin tone ? And frankly a corpse 3 days old smells to the point that no emotion will allow you to ignore that, and the smell is easily detected from 10 meters away in open air (no matter how exiting a medical student tells you it is, never open a drawer with a corpse, just don't, you'll still smell it constantly a week later).<p>The easy explanation for all of this is very, very simple : those kids are alive (they even look like they're holding their eyes closed, although that could be an impression). Lying about it would be perfectly in line with islamic practice (probably important for large angry mobs in gaze, don't you think ?), it would explain the lack of wounds, lack of blood/other bodily fluids, the eyes, the skin tone, the flexibility of the children, everything.<p>That would of course mean that it is a complete lie, and the photographer is very likely complicit.",1368443630

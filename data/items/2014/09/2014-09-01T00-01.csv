Following the open source model, it depends on <i>people like you</i> to help out with coding new features. If doing full WARC captures is something that you feel is important, you might want to help out and contribute the necessary code. Zotero&#x27;s code base is pretty approachable.

I know this doesn&#x27;t mean much, but makes it less likely to be a Photostream breach, as for that to happen, we&#x27;d likely only see photos taken with iPhone or iPad. This makes it much more likely to be from someone&#x27;s personal backup. Could be iCloud, but not likely to be a Photostream exploit.<p>- Some videos in leak, and as far as I know, though I could be wrong, Photostream doesn&#x27;t back up videos, only photos. So again likely a backup.<p>- Specifically with what look to be webcam examples, I don&#x27;t want to downplay these celebrities tech knowledge, but to send webcam photos, I would guess email or something was used, not iMessage, etc. Again, likely to probably be from a backup.<p>My thoughts are that someone who has been overly friendly with a lot of female celebrities either had a really bad Apple ID password, so it was compromised on a device, where photos from a Photos.app backup were grabbed from. That, or some sort of stolen phone/laptop for the same person. I&#x27;m skeptical, but doesnt look like a wide spread Apple iCloud exploit yet.",1409533013

Kolmogorov presented an approach to probability theory phrased in the language of set theory and measure theory. This language was just then becoming so fashionable that today many mathematical results are named, not for the discoverer, but for the one who first restated them in that language. For example, in the theory of continuous groups the term “Hurwitz invariant integral” disappeared, to be replaced by “Haar measure.” Because of this custom, some modern works—particularly by mathematicians—can give one the impression that probability theory started with Kolmogorov. [...]<p>However, our system of probability differs conceptually from that of Kolmogorov in that we do not interpret propositions in terms of sets, but we do interpret probability distributions as carriers of incomplete information. Partly as a result, our system has analytical resources not present at all in the Kolmogorov system. This enables us to formulate and solve many problems—particularly the so-called “ill posed” problems and “generalized inverse” problems—that would be considered outside the scope of probability theory according to the Kolmogorov system. These problems are just the ones of greatest interest in current applications.",1409530510

Kunal Mehta, a Wikipedian from San Jose, recently wrote a protoype bot that can add archived versions to any link in Wikipedia so that when those links are determined to be dead the links can be switched over automatically and continue to work.  It will take a while to work this through the process the Wikipedia community of editors uses to approve bots, but that conversation is under way.</i>",1409530306

8250963,comment,8250357,8250357,35,0,stevenh,,,"Apple has always feigned a very strict and even preemptively cynical and condescending attitude toward developers regarding App Store approval. In their official statements, they always say things to the tune of &quot;this isn&#x27;t amateur hour. You&#x27;re playing in the big leagues now. If your app doesn&#x27;t have a polished feel to it, then it will simply be rejected.&quot; <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guid...</a><p>Despite this, they&#x27;ll go ahead and approve apps which are so horrible that your middle school programming teacher would have failed you if you had created it as your first project in HyperCard. For example, have a look at this atrocious pile of garbage, which was allowed to sit at the #2 spot in the iOS free app charts for nearly three solid weeks earlier this year after Flappy Bird was pulled: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vk1BnfJ7UM&t=1m50s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vk1BnfJ7UM&t=1m50s</a><p>(and no, that&#x27;s not a poorly recorded video; it&#x27;s showing the actual gameplay frame rate.)<p>I don&#x27;t think we can have an honest discussion about App Store rejections or approvals without discussing this elephant in the room: Overly-simple, ridiculously ugly games. In the past month, all kinds of ugly stick figure and moving rectangle-based games have reached the top 10 of the iOS free app charts. The creators weren&#x27;t even reaching for an 8-bit aesthetic, the games were just simply horribly made and rushed out the door. These apps were inexplicably accepted into the App Store despite their horrendous quality. Some examples of games which reached the top 10:<p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-line/id880338977"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-line/id880338977</a><p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-them-jump/id900211132"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-them-jump/id900211132</a><p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazing-brick/id905455244"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazing-brick/id905455244</a><p>Those games in particular were created by the same crooks (Ketchapp) infamous for being the first to port 2048 to mobile without the true creator&#x27;s permission. I&#x27;m assuming everyone playing that clone of 2048 was shown ads pointing to their new games, which resulted in those games being artificially pumped to the top 10. While that is despicable in itself, what is equally as vexing is that those hideous games were ever approved for the App Store in the first place.<p>There is a massive disconnect between what Apple says regarding their review process and what actually happens. They can say whatever they want, but in actual reality, it&#x27;s essentially random and luck-based, and dependent upon whatever mood the reviewers happen to be in. (And apparently it helps if you&#x27;ve already been successful on the App Store before. &quot;Oh, your app looks absolutely terrible? Well, you made us a lot of money with your 2048 rip-off once, so it&#x27;s no problem; go ahead and flood us with your worst!&quot;)",1409530286

Learn the logic puzzles, how to chit chat about linked lists and binary trees. Learn how to white board, how to handle the 30ish standard programming questions in short time on a white board. Typically, if you&#x27;re looking for a high-level language job (Ruby and Javascript in my experience), a lot of the time people will ask you to solve low level problems ignoring the abstractions such languages provide, so learn how to write C++ solutions in Python. Reading books like Cracking The Interview Code will get you most of the way through this, but I&#x27;d also advise to read up on internet fundamentals (http, etc.)<p>* Apply to a bunch of places. Embrace being repeatedly told that you don&#x27;t seem good enough for the people you want to associate with, for a variety of unfair seeming reasons. Look forward to the day when that feeling is transformed to a dull sense of belonging based on your economic utility.<p>* Put yourself into experiences that come closer to typical  software work experience. Work with other people, work under a time pressure, work to meet existing customer needs, work for payment. You could try hackathons, freelance work, contributing to open source, working with other people on their projects.<p>* Meet more developers. Ask for their opinions on how to best develop themselves, inside scoop on jobs available, etc.<p>* If possible, broaden your search beyond a single city. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re in SF. SF may have a lot of software jobs, but it has a lot of developers too, and the fact that they have to pay people a large enough salary to offset the costs of living there make it a bit more competitive than somewhere without absurdly high costs of living.",1409530035

427889,comment,427079,427079,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I like it a lot. Will show it to my gf as well. The style of the website is very nice and clean. I love the sproost logo! I have a few criticisms though.<p>The quiz is very long and it seemed to my european eyes that there's an overhang of traditional styles and little differentiation among contemporary options. Modern seems to imply asian.<p>I didn't like most of the rooms, but after making my choices the system summerised my style pretty well. Very well actually.<p>The ""design your room"" page suffers from some layout quirks (Firefox 3). One of the items in my room got stuck when I switched to selecting more items from the sofas category. That rug just kept hovering on top of the sofas and only went away once I used the budget slider. I wasn't able to repeat it later though.<p>I love the budget slider but sometimes it didn't stick. It kept snapping back to the greatest price range.<p>My room looks a little jumbled because the pics aren't aligned at all. I understand that I'm supposed to arrange the items as I see fit, but that doesn't make much sense to me since I can't possibly make the whole thing look anything like a real room. The sizes and perspectives are just too different. I suggest you pre-align the items next to each other. People can still move the items around if they want to.<p>I appreciate that it's very difficult to actually let people design a room that looks like a room. It would work a little better if I could zoom individual items so I could at least put that lamp next to the sofa and make them look proportionally sized. To take this further you could figure out the sizes of the pieces from the vendors' sites and automatically zoom them accordingly. I know, I know that's a massive amount of work and maybe it wouldn't help enough to make a real difference.<p>I'm not sure why the ""saved rooms"" and the ""design your room"" pages are separate pages. I would prefer a drop-down to select other saved rooms right on the ""design your room"" page. The cost rundown could be placed on the ""buy your furniture"" tab or dynamically displayed by clicking somewhere next to the total. In my opinion, there are too many pages and menu/tab levels.<p>The ""to be added"" section isn't very useful I think, but if it's there it should at least let me remove stuff from it.<p>The signup process is OK. No confirmation emails, no nothing, just an email address. But I would still let people see the room designer before making them sign up.",1231588166

427887,comment,426014,426845,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, I pondered doing this for my memory game (pairs). You think there would be much interest for this? I could even automate it to create memory games from flickr.",1231588040
427886,comment,427249,427249,0,0,SingAlong,,,"So if you are going to make profit out of a site built on top of the Flickr API, then you'll have to use the commercial API. So the factors to consider would include the cost of the commercial API too. Besides, you'll also have to use some merchant account/Paypl to process payments which again eats off a bit of the money you get out of your commission you get out of letting people sell the pics.<p>This idea would automatically turn a amateur photographer's or artist's flickr account into something the person can make a profit by selling his best stuff. That would atleast fund upgrading his cameras or buy new colors. You could start by targeting amateur photographers and artists. But make sure you find an extra stream of revenue apart from sales commission.<p>But idea is sweet.",1231587963

427884,comment,427292,427705,0,0,jwesley,,,"1. If a novel is intended to be realistic fiction, it should reflect reality, not the author's philosophical agenda. (My opinion, but I think this is the only way serious art reveals truth. Imagine if Marx had written a novel.) This is distinct from fantasy. I'm a Tolkien fan too, but I don't think anyone would turn to LOTR for economic guidance.<p>2. Artificially low interest rates reflect Greenspan's belief that given enough liquidity, markets will be self correcting. He thought banks were in the best position to protect themselves from risk because they bear the greatest consequences of failure. (He has since admitted the failure of this belief.) Clearly they were not, as the low interest rates lead to further inflation of the credit bubble.",1231587831
427883,comment,427740,427740,0,0,marcell,,,">> ""But the iPhone platform is also, in many ways, problematic. Programming native apps in Objective C is really hard work (or so the friends whoâ€™ve done it tell me). Palm greatly reduces the barriers to entry by making app development html/css/javascript-based, meaning any web developer (maybe even me) could get started.""<p>A warning to bloggers: when you don't know what you're talking about but talk anyways, it's very obvious. And it hurts your credibility. I wouldn't complain about problems with the World Series of Poker in a blog post, and if you've never used Objective-C/Cocoa, it's best if you don't complain about it.",1231587362

427880,comment,427112,427591,0,0,swombat,,,"I understand that, but as it happens, sets (and mix CDs which are basically less often released, higher quality sets) are the only thing I listen to as far as electronic music is concerned.<p>I do not listen to progressive house in single tracks. That doesn't even begin to make sense - progressive house is all about the progression across a set.<p>The input of a DJ in selecting, arranging, mixing the tracks into a set is what makes electronic music great to me. I would not buy single electronic music tracks, but I might consider paying for a subscription that would give me access to vast amounts of sets by the likes of John Digweed, Anthony Pappa, Sasha, Dave Seaman, Mirel Jarca, Nick Warren, Danny Howells, etc...<p>Also, worth noting, if I can't download them to my computer in a DRM-free format, those sets are absolutely worthless to me. However, I'd be very willing to pay a subscription fee (even with a - reasonably generous - limit on the number of sets that I can download. In fact, I used to subscribe (for money) to freshlymixed.com, and all they did was record and republish Digweed's kiss100 mixes and the Essential Mixes from BBC 1.",1231586349

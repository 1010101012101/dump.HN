But I also believe the distribution should be controlled by those who can be identified in the recording.<p>The biggest deciding factor in this case should be if the recording was interfering with keeping the peace or not.  If it's a personal issue, then the Officers were acting in a personal capacity and they were abusing their power. They should handle the situation the same way I would if someone were recording me.<p>If I reported to the Police that someone was unlawfully recording me, what do you think they would do?",1265122734

Sure, there are people who throw away massive amounts of time into the game, but there are plenty of other people who play a reasonable amount.<p>I spend 2 evenings a week raiding, with 1-2 hours throughout the week (plus another hour or two on the weekends, when I can) doing other things. Twice a week, a group of 10 friends get together, log onto WoW and a Ventrilo server, and mess around for a few hours. I think of it a lot like a bowling/poker night for some guys, except you're significantly more likely to invite a new, potentially interesting person to a WoW raid than you are to your weekly game.<p>Honestly, I find the whole ""If it does not have direct monetary value, or somehow advance my career/list of contacts, it isn't worth doing"" stance that many people take rather disturbing. No, playing WoW doesn't directly benefit me, but the indirect benefits have been pretty awesome. I've kept in touch with several old friends I otherwise wouldn't have, met a lot of interesting people, and it gives me something I can talk about with at least 10% of the population.

In this particular case IE6 will obey the content header since it doesn't understand the html5 doctype and will try to ""download"" the content instead.<p>It should be trivial to setup a test case if you want.

Unlike the others, Clojure is not multi-paradigm, you <i>will</i> use it functionally (well, unless you use it as syntactic gloss for programming in Java, which misses much of the point).<p>Here's the most recent HN item on getting up to speed with Clojure: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1086562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1086562</a><p>Note that getting SLIME up at this very moment might require a bit of trickery, a recent SLIME commit broke it for Clojure's use of it.  Be sure to check out the Clojure Google group and feel free to ask any sorts of questions on it if you get stuck (the community is a lot better than CL's).<p>(Historical notes: CL is bad for networking and concurrency because it was formalized before there were standards for those areas and it has been stuck in amber since then.  Various implimentations have non-standardized libraries for them (there may be something of a standard for threads, I forget, but in many CL implementations threading support itself is iffy at best).  And you already know the networking story (which CL are you trying?).<p>Scheme standardization is <i>very</i> slow; it is progressing, there are optional SRFI (Scheme Requests for Implementation) standards for each of the above (I think, not sure about networking), but I can't recommend it for what you're trying.  If you e.g. wanted to start from the bottom up by going through the SICP or another book, that would be fine, or if you wanted to research language stuff it's great, but it just doesn't yet have a general modern programming ecosystem and won't for some years if ever.  In general, you match your needs with the implementation and its packaged libraries and go from there.  If you want to try that route anyway, ask me for some pointers.)",1265119905

There is a board six feet from my desk which lists every name of regular employees for the two groups closest to us on the org chart, with a plastic marker indicating whether they're in or out of the office.  The arrangement of names on that board is important: last time it got shuffled the lady in charge of it literally solicited the opinions of two senior team members as to whether it would be more appropriate to swap CoworkerX and I or not.  That's superficial, though, too.<p>To really get a feel for it you'd have to go to the office and watch who talks to who and how (Japanese has multiple different levels for polite language).  For example, I work very closely with M-san.  M-san is freakishly talented and a good company man -- everyone treats him with more respect than you would have predicted for his age.  Except for S-san, our crusty old network admin, who is the 10x engineer to M-san's 10x engineering -- his form of address for M-san is close to ""You, boy, I have homework for you"".

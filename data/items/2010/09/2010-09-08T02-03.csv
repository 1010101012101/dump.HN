I'm calling BS.  Evolution wants to spread genetics as quickly as possible and isn't going to wait for you to be emotionally and intellectually ready, at the risk of you dying in the mean time.",1283914782

1670869,comment,1669075,1669359,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"The reason for the name Agile is that it was defined in opposition to what came before it- heavyweight, big design up front, fixed requirements, documentation heavy, non-incremental, non-iterative processes. These methods had names- CMM, RUP, V Model, MDA, MIL-STD-498, and we needed a name for the anti-method to go against them and not be labeled a cowboy coder with no process at all, and sidelined from all important decisions.<p>These were attempts to take the risk and uncertainty out of the process. Agile is an attempt to provide practices and approaches for dealing with the uncertainty- ""embrace change"" is very much the opposite of the ""change is too expensive"" mindset that it was trying to reset.<p>This adjective ""agile"" is important, if only to be used as a defense against 300 page requirement documents set in stone by a contract, 500 diagram architectures created before a line of code was written, developers who never got to talk to a user.<p>If we didn't have agile coaches and advocates, people who sat down to come up with a way to run their project might come up with the naive algorithm and head straight over the waterfall.<p>I can see how the name doesn't seem to make much sense now that it is bandied about in very prescriptive step by step methods that probably seem not very agile to a person who had not lived through the horrors that came before. However, that is how it should be understood.",1283914683

1670859,comment,1670712,1670712,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"BTW, here is what DDH had to say (before it was revealed who exactly had commissioned this car). So far as I can tell, this was originally posted in the Zonda forums which requires a login (I found it reposted at the link below [1]).<p>--------------------------------------------------------<p>It turned out to be even cooler, though. I've basically commissioned Pagani to build me a special one-off that's going to be called the Pagani Zonda HH. It'll use most of the bodywork of a Zonda F Roadster, but have the upgraded 680 hp Cinque engine as well as the carbon-titanium tub, ceramic coated titanium exhaust, etc. The car is going to weigh around 1210 kg (2670 pounds).<p>I'm currently in the midst of designing this car with Mr. Pagani and his team of designers. It's going to be complete this year.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>Thanks for all the kind words, guys. I certainly don't fit the standard profile of Zonda owners these days. The majority of recent customers either run their own countries, are part of some royal family, sheiks, or distinctively old money. So I think it's been fun for the Pagani team to deal with someone who actually still have to worry what stuff costs and is about the same age as many of the employees wink.gif.<p>The color is likely going to be Monterrey Blue or a close variety of that. I've wanted a Lamborghini in that color since forever, but it never came to pass, so now I'm trying it on the Zonda. We're currently playing with a few yellow highlights as well, but that's not a sure thing yet.<p>The design and the specs are indeed an open buffet of everything Pagani has worked on with the Zonda for the last 10 years. I've been picking and choosing stuff. My car, I believe, is going to be the only stick car mated with the new, more powerful engine. Most of the recent cars have been paddle cars. Which is kinda funny, because usually I love paddles, but for the Zonda, it seems to fit very well as a manual. The car is very much a simple, mechanical car. Not a lot of computers in there, so a stick seemed to fit it as well.<p>The default choice, though, is to use the newest of everything. So center-lock wheels, the new F1-based ceramic coated titanium exhaust system (it's stunning, same system as you can see on the Zonda R), carbon-ceramic brakes, the carbon-titanium tub (only road car in the world using that, it's about 30% lighter than carbon-fiber and even stronger), and of course the new 680 hp AMG V12.<p>We're currently trading renderings back and forth. They'll send me a rendering and I'll draw some ideas on it and we'll bounce back and forth. I'm hoping that we'll have the visual design locked down by next week and I can share some final pictures. It's going to look like a cross between the Cinque and the F. I'm not going to have the Cobra-style air intake on top (that was a little much!) and the front is F too.<p>Also, I'm definitely buying this to drive and keep it forever. It's not going to merely sit in a garage museum somewhere, which unfortunately is true of a fair number of Zonda's. Although, even at this stratospheric pricing, the Zonda has been doing very well on resale. The incredibly few cars that have come up for sale has been going for 20-30% over their sales price. But short of falling on hard times, I don't really care. To me, this is the best looking, best driving car ever made in the history of cars. Why would I want to sell that?<p>So far, Pagani has made 118 Zonda's. 3 of them has been totaled, so there are currently 115 left. He's currently wrapping up some of the special editions, like the Zonda R and Tricolore, but the new car is coming soon, so they estimate that no more than 120-125 Zonda's will ever be made. That's about the same number of cars as McLaren made of the F1.<p>--------------------------------------------------------<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.teamspeed.com/forums/supercars/45181-zonda-hh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamspeed.com/forums/supercars/45181-zonda-hh.htm...</a>",1283914419

Eating healthy is just as important, separated into two categories: overall caloric intake, and nutritional content.<p>Car analogies are a dime a dozen in computing, but they apply here as well. Not exercising is like changing the oil in your car every 10,000-15,000 miles, instead of every 3,000 - 6,000. Your car is still going to last years, but its lifespan will be shortened, and it's going to run poorly towards the end of it. The nice thing about a car is you can repair it, or buy a new one. Repairing a human is tricky, and you definitely can't buy a new one.<p>I'm absolutely baffled by those who put their careers or money at a higher priority than their own physical health. You really want to be rich and famous with a crappy body? Is type 2 diabetes, along with likely amputations, blindness, and erectile dysfunction, your thing? Looking forward to clogged arteries and heart disease? What about stroke, wiping away your ability to control your own body, or even being able to think or speak?

He dissected cadavers (donated human corpses) during one of his classes. My family and I went out to visit, and he was able to let us look at one.<p>My father, who is about 30 pounds overweight in his late-50's, hasn't really cared about his health. He eats too much high-saturated-fat ice cream, puts cream in his coffee, likes cookies with lots of butter in them, etc... I've been trying to get him to eat healthier and exercise for years to no avail.<p>Well, my brother was having me hold/feel the heart from the cadaver (it was already cut out of the dissected body). I was squishing some of the arteries with gloves on, and my brother said ""Try squishing this Coronary Artery. Sometimes it might be crunchy from heart disease.""<p>So I did, and WOW! It was ROCK SOLID! So much calcium and plaque had built up inside this persons heart that it completely clogged the artery. It was as if there was a pebble-sized rock inside of it.<p>Of course, I forced my father to put some gloves on and feel it for himself. Well, that scared the SHIT out of him! These last few weeks since, he's made a decision to stay away from high-fat foods (and has been doing so - non-fat ice cream now, skim milk in coffee, etc...).

1670825,comment,1670325,1670325,0,0,jerf,,,"I'm not sure this argument stands up to the facts. Women have been pouring into every discipline over the past twenty+ years. That's a significant number because we're now talking people born in the 1990s, which can not be said to be a decade untouched by feminism. Women are graduating with more degrees then men now, women are the majority on campus, and the proportions are rising. Every discipline, engineering and computer science no exception, has been soliciting for women and minorities for decades now.<p>And yet, as pointed out in the article, the percentage of computer science degrees awarded to women is going <i>down</i>, which I think is an acceptable proxy for the presence of women in tech. Yet numerous other ""male"" fields have been entered and in some cases dominated by women. The very same women who were raised on Barbies and ponies.<p>Is the <i>only</i> theory that fits the facts that somehow, virtually uniquely across all the fields into which the women have come streaming in, despite equal if not at times greater solicitation for women to come in to the discipline, computer science has somehow escaped the incredible dominance of political correctness on campuses and managed to create this fantastically and uniquely hostile environment for women, and therefore has some sort of major responsibility for changing itself? The <i>only</i> hypothesis?<p>What about this one: In an environment where a thousand voices are shouting for the women to come study $X, it doesn't take very much of a natural disinclination towards a certain discipline for it to very, very rarely be the top choice for a woman. It's not as if there aren't disciplines unbalanced every bit as much in favor of women, and for the same reason; it doesn't take much natural disinclination, for whatever the reason, for a field to very, very rarely be the top choice for the man.<p>Every year that goes by like this, every year that the STEM initiatives get even more strident and better funded, every year that women continue streaming from our very-politically-correct lower schooling systems into our very-politically-correct higher schooling systems and choose not to study computer science, I find the hypothesis that computer science is somehow deficient that much less compelling. If computer science were any more solicitous of women we'd have to <i>draft</i> them.<p>(Note: For once I do not necessarily mean ""politically correct"" as a slur. For the purposes of this message, I merely mean that the idea that primary or higher education has been systematically structured against woman for the past twenty years is absurd. The <i>suspicion</i> of sexism in this environment, in this timeframe, is enough to end your career advancement, if not your career itself. Maybe, just maybe, it's time to consider a hypothesis other than the ""deck is stacked"" hypothesis that we've been using for something like <i>fifty years</i> now and consider just for a moment some other hypotheses, in the interests of science.<p>I am also confining myself to the question of the education time; even if the workplace is somehow hostile to women today, the ultimate solution to that problem is graduating more women into it; between that and the copious and rather strong laws on this front it'll work itself out after that.)",1283913325

C.B. operators running splatter-prone illegal amplifiers were bad enough, but people discovered these apparently ""empty"" channels (sometimes called 3A 7A 11A 15A 19A 22A and 22B) and modified their radios to use them.  Eventually the F.C.C. gave up on those channels being viable for things like garage doors and R.C. model airplanes, and they became part of 40 channel C.B.<p>I think some of that remote control equipment shared 72 to 76 Mhz for a while.  That's a gap, 2/3 the size of a t.v. channel between channels 4 and 5.<p>I'm wondering if the F.C.C. will take away t.v. channels 2 through 6.  Almost everywhere, the stations formerly on those went to U.H.F. with the digital transition.  I guess they figure that few people want to buy really big antennas for the lowest frequencies.  (UHF and 7-13 use much shorter antenna elements).  Anyway, those channels have the best coverage potential of all of them, but they're hardly used now.

By and large, I think, society starts conditioning for gender roles very early-girls get dolls, guys get erector sets.

That, unfortunately, is difficult, when some (very vocal) people refuse to acknowledge that there is any discrimination in society, and many would think that changing culture around toys is ""just being PC.""<p>Such a large change would take a massive effort. While the STEM initiatives going on today, especially those directed at minorities, are a step in the right direction, for them to be effective, I think they'd have to get a <i>lot</i> more mainstream awareness--right now, some people are aware of them, but the majority, in my experience, are not, and even among those that are aware of it, not many a) think it's a good idea and b) care.<p>Perhaps if a bunch of celebrities got behind it, ads were taken out online and on primetime TV, and politicians started caring?

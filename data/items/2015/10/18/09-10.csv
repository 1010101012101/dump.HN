10407722,comment,10405143,10407264,0,0,mikekchar,,,"It is really unfortunate that people down vote something that is wrong without actually saying what is wrong about it.  I think it would help, though, to acknowledge that your opinion is unlikely to be shared with others and to append something like, &quot;Can anyone explain where I&#x27;m going wrong?&quot;<p>Now, I don&#x27;t actually know much about type theory at all and came here to try to remove some of my ignorance.  As such, I can&#x27;t really help you much, but I will try my best.  You might want to look at: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory</a><p>If I read it correctly (and if it is written correctly), a &quot;term&quot; is essentially anything with a &quot;type&quot;.  So 1, 2 and 3 are terms and they have a type.  A &quot;function&quot; is something that takes terms and &quot;reduces&quot; them to other terms.  You can &quot;apply&quot; a function to some arguments in order to reduce them.  So if we have a function, &quot;myfunc x&quot;, we can apply that to 2 and have &quot;myfunc 2&quot;.  Both &quot;myfunc x&quot; and &quot;myfunc 2&quot; are terms, but they have different types.<p>Let&#x27;s make a function that doubles an integer (let&#x27;s call the type &quot;int&quot;).  So &quot;double x&quot; is a term with a type of &quot;int -> int&quot;: it maps an int onto an int.  &quot;double 2&quot; is a term with a type of int.  The term &quot;double double 1&quot; can be &quot;reduced&quot; to the term &quot;double 2&quot;. &quot;double 2&quot; can be &quot;reduced&quot; to the term &quot;4&quot;.  4 is known as a &quot;normalized term&quot;.  It can not be reduced any further.<p>Now, you may be saying &quot;How is this different from what I said?&quot;  From what I can tell, the main difference is that a type is <i>not</i> a set of &quot;values&quot; (or normalized terms).  Functions applied to terms also have a type.  Functions with free variables also have a type.  Anything that is a term in an expression has a type.  So 1, 2 and 4 are of type int.  &quot;double 1&quot;, &quot;double 2&quot;, and &quot;double double 1&quot; are also all of type int.  If we had a function called &quot;fortytwo&quot; that just returned 42, it would also be of type int.<p>It may seem like a small (possibly insignificant) difference, but it really depends on your point of view.  We can completely ignore the type if we want to.  Many programming languages make that very easy.  We could also subscribe to the idea that a type is just a set of values, like you said.  We can write many fine (and many not-so-fine) programs with that point of view.<p>These views limit the kind of analysis we can do on the code that is written, though.  The point of using type theory in computer languages is to help us reason about the code analytically.  So my answer to your (unasked) question is, it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be complicated.  It proves useful to include all of the nuances that type theory gives us.  Intentionally putting blinders on to make it seem simple, just deprives us of potentially useful capabilities.<p>Hopefully someone who actually knows something about this topic will chime in and correct whatever horrible mistakes I&#x27;ve made.",1445162124

I like tools like that, the ones that just do what you tell them to without any fuss.<p>The biggest drill I have here is a Bosch contractor version, it&#x27;s &#x27;only&#x27; 1150 watts, spins really slow but makes drilling holes in just about anything deceptively easy. I&#x27;m always very conscious of my position relative to the tool and I&#x27;m very careful making sure that if it would seize that I can release the trigger. The day I bought it I wore out my previous drill on a hole in a concrete floor, it just died and gave up the ghost.

10407670,comment,10407601,10407640,0,0,iofj,,,"> i think we need to define limits in terms of energy<p>Ok. Let&#x27;s do that. The earth receives about 10,000 exajoule per day (3850000 per year) [1]. Daily human caloric intake is 2500 calories [2]. Let&#x27;s say inefficiency and the fact that you actually need food, not pure energy, let&#x27;s say that means 20% efficiency, so 12500 calories per human daily. 12500 calories is about 50k joules. Things like running a tv/computer/... would be peanuts on top of that so they &quot;come free&quot;.<p>So divide one by the other. The earth, without space based power, can keep about 1e18 humans alive on this planet using just earth-based solar power.<p>Plus you have to keep into account what humans actually do : they convert chemical energy into heat. If we cover the planet in solar panels, why couldn&#x27;t we recover most of that human-generated heat ? Let&#x27;s say we can recover 99% of energy that we put into humans back out, that&#x27;s another factor of 100 right there.<p>We could use nuclear to increase that number to 1e30 or so for a millenium and if you count fusion based power, the numbers become completely ridiculous.<p>To put that number in perspective, take it like this : when every human alive today breeds into a population the size of today&#x27;s entire human population, then we&#x27;d be near the &quot;pure solar&quot; carrying capacity of just the planet itself. If we were to beam power from space to the planet, we wouldn&#x27;t run into the next limit until 1e50 at least.<p>So we are very, very, very far away, even on an exponential population curve, from the carrying capacity of the planet. When fitting an exponential curve to some sample data (very inaccurate, but good enough for a ballpark figure), I get that if the growth since WWII (1.36% per year, starting at 2000 with 6 billion people), then we&#x27;d get to 1e18 a little after the year 3400.<p>> we broke those limits by displacing a lot of other life<p>Only for a few measurements. There are a lot of problematic measurements of life that are inaccurate and therefore full of noise, and can be outright deceptive. Some of those measurements look bad : number of species, for instance. But how relevant is that number ? Sure, if it keeps dropping our zoos will become boring, but what will actually happen ? The truth is nobody knows, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a reason, aside from nostalgia, to assume it&#x27;s bad. One &quot;real metric&quot; that is at least measurable and I believe is meaningful : the total amount of life is total biomass, and it is pretty well known that humans have increased that by a lot.<p>> at some point however that fact will effect us unpredictably<p>It seems to me to be pretty much a given that lots of things can affect the human race unpredictably, and given how many such factors there are, it seems a safe bet that a few are indeed going to affect us (though the vast majority won&#x27;t). Malthusianism and global warming are such factors, malthusianism has been proven false 3-4 times at least, and many limits to growth theories both before and after have been (I like the economic &quot;debt limit&quot; ones, stating that we can never have an economy larger than the value of all gold, then we passed that, then money became &quot;loaned gold&quot;, and the next theory was that there was some factor that limits how big the economy can be n * total_gold, n was to be 10, then 100, now it&#x27;s at least 100 million, and they&#x27;re still at it), I wonder what the fate of global warming will be.<p>If you believe in Darwin and evolution, this is a positive. We will adapt to whatever effect, predictable or unpredictable, starts affecting us.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/diet/estimated-calorie-requirement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/diet/estimated-calorie-requirement</a>",1445159923

Therefore, the only adoptable protocols are mere transports. They might rigidly specify some commonly used things like property titles (stock orders) but foreseeing unusual or unknown requirements, such protocols will include custom extension features (user defined fields).<p>The end result is a protocol which is sort of useful but still does not suffice for the development of generic tooling. An example from FIX is the field which tells whether an order added or removed liquidity. The standard didn&#x27;t have such a field, so now every exchange has its own different one.",1445159904

Still, this experiment lends weight to the idea that somebody should run that study.<p>> It&#x27;s hard to generalize without a larger-scale study, but the article has some evidence to the contrary<p>This is an interesting and subtle case: they gave out money, and did some amount of aid work (the article indicates £50k was spent, of which £39k was the handouts, and it&#x27;s not clear what the rest was spent on), in a city where addiction treatment is free and readily available to anybody who&#x27;s willing to take it. That combination of things worked, at least in these cases, and I think that&#x27;s consistent with my expectations that we need combined financial, healthcare, and education support to get really good results. To get more insight we&#x27;d need a study which ran the same programme in many locations, including ones where these things are not readily available.<p>> But if by moderate you mean $100 then of course they&#x27;ll be begging again tomorrow. It has to offer a new perspective.<p>And therein lies the tricky part: it&#x27;s definitely true that if you give somebody enough money, it will solve all these problems for them. Unfortunately it&#x27;s just unaffordable to raise everybody to the median income. Can we afford enough to make a difference at the population level, even if it&#x27;s not enough to make all their problems go away?

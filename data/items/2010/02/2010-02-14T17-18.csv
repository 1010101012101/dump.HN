1124931,comment,1124915,1124915,0,0,jeffmould,,,"Can you be more specific as to what you are looking to buy/sell? There are a lot of resources out there, but it really depends on what you are looking for specifically.<p>The best leads though come from your own marketing efforts. Just avoid spamming to obtain leads. Creating a blog, social media marketing (Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn), and your website are going to be your biggest drivers. Consider reaching out on LinkedIn for quality business leads. Join groups, respond to questions/answers, explore your contacts.<p>Paying for leads can be a recipe for disaster in my mind and is really just a waste of money. On the other hand, if you are looking to create a direct mail campaign to a specific group (i.e. realtors, doctors, etc...) in a specific region, you may explore sites like InfoUSA.",1266170270

However, if you've got a day or two to kill, you could probably fix that.  After that you'll have to rebuild the dashboard.

1124925,comment,1124139,1124805,0,0,mtts,,,"Since I snapped at your previous comment, it's only fair I try to respond to this rather more thoughtful one.<p>I agree with your assessment that the story is about ""about ambition, about art, about being misunderstood, and about greatness"". No argument there.<p>The loneliness is all over the text, sometimes quite literally:<p>* ""withdrawing deep into himself, paying no attention to anyone or anything, not even to the all-important striking of the clock that was the only piece of furniture in his cage, but merely staring into vacancy with half-shut eyes, now and then taking a sip from a tiny glass of water to moisten his lips""<p>And of course the hunger artist is lonely because he stands apart from the world (quite literally - he lives in a cage, after all) and does something no one quite understands (not to mention that after a while he can't even find an audience for his art anymore).<p>It has nothing to do, I think, with winning or losing. The hunger artist wins, if you want, when he is at the height of his fame in the beginning of the story, but in the end he withers away in his cage, ignored by the public and ultimately is replaced by a panther, which if you want to put a label on it would be losing. So if Kafka is saying anything about winning or losing at all, it would seem to be that fortune is transient and has nothing to do with the drive to do something (the hunger artist is committed to his art regardless of the size of his audience).<p>And even his commitment to his art is ultimately questioned: he has no drive to excel at fasting but rather has simply never come across food that he liked to eat. The great artist in the end turns out to be nothing more than a victim of his circumstances.<p>Hardly an uplifting or inspiring message, I think.<p>Which is not to say I don't like this story: I do. I think it's, like a lot of Kafka's work, fantastic. I'm not sure whether it belongs on HN, but I enjoyed reading it again and thinking about it. So thanks for posting.",1266170127
1124924,story,,,1,1,evancaine,"Ask HN: what do you think are ebay's weaknesses?",,"I was chatting to a friend of mine about PG's ""Ideas we'd like to fund"" and we had an interesting debate about online auctions. At the moment, ebay has a near monopoly and my friend doesn't think this will change any time soon.  I disagree. There are countless examples of start-ups disrupting existing monopolies.<p>Many people try to out-ebay ebay, and I think this is their mistake. There's not much wrong with ebay from a buyer's point of view. Yes it has it's flaws but not enough to convince buyers to leave en masse.<p>The seller's experience on the other hand is drastically different. The web is littered with complaints from sellers yet they continue to sell on ebay because that's where the buyers are.  All the ebay competitors that have come and gone over the years have focused on tempting the seller away (usually with lower fees) but I think that's the wrong approach. Competitors should concentrate on winning over the buyers and the seller's will follow, but as I mentioned earlier, while there are no major issues with the buying experience, buyers will stick with ebay.  I think this is what's behind ebay's recent spate of policy changes all designed to keep the buyer happy, regardless of the cost or inconvenience to the seller.<p>What are people's thoughts on this? Does ebay have an Achilles heel?",1266169927

What is your worst engineer scheduled to do this month that is more important than that?<p>That's a question I'd like to ask anybody who isn't A/B testing yet.  Seriously.  What keeps you so busy that you can't adopt a low-risk, battle-tested, low-investment strategy with stupendously scaling returns like A/B testing?

For a while it has seemed like AI researchers were too enamored with the idea that humans were inborn with certain ideas like language and motor capability, and that they should try to replicate that inbuiltness in a machine.<p>My take is that humans are born with little more than sensory perception, and a mechanism for recognizing patterns and cause and effect (this is known as memory).<p>If you observe the actions of young children closely, I think you'll find that they are consistent with the actions of someone trying to conduct experiments in the world beginning with very little information.<p>When my younger siblings were babies they would do the old routine of ""holding my hands up around my face and waving them around.""

Now during that time most of the industrialized world was destroyed by wars and America was able to prosper significantly -- as global competition picked up we were no longer competitive.  It has nothing to do with high income taxes.<p>The country is in 11 trillion dollars in debt because it spends money it doesn't have on things it shouldn't be spending money on. 90% of what people need from government is handled at the local level -- @ the federal level we have national defense, immigration, and the federal judicial system.

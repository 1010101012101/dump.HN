Actually Iranians have a lot of Western ideas and he was totally chill until we tried to get him to watch Bruno which he vehemently protested but asides I felt kinda embarrassed at how ignorant I was about Iran. It&#x27;s nothing like what&#x27;s being shown in the media, Iranian cuisine is fantastic, I love hearing Farsi (it&#x27;s like French but better), women are really beautiful.<p>edit: wow somebody really doesn&#x27;t like the fact that I don&#x27;t view Iran as terrorist that American media loves to paint.",1436903995

Something like the MS Ergo 4000 or Sculpt, with Cherry MXes.<p>Closest I&#x27;ve found is the Matias Ergo Pro[1], but it has several inexplicably bad design decisions. Dedicated Copy paste undo buttons, that just send ctrl-z,x,c,v. Awkward positioning of Ctrl and Escape for no reason. Terrible crappy little arrow keys. Really weird shit like having a USB hub, then putting the port on the inside with no space to plug things in. After using it for a month, I&#x27;m still often making mistakes and will probably go back to the MS Sculpt, which at least has scissor switches instead of the terrible domes.<p>It&#x27;s like every keyboard designer to do ergo has had a stroke and intentionally messes stuff up. Kinesis is stuck in the 90s with their huge success and terrible look (and again, weird layout). The Keyboardio is probably the least offensive, as long as the modifier key system is smooth. It&#x27;s stupid that in 2015 we still don&#x27;t have great keyboards. The stackoverflow guy&#x27;s CODE keyboard even focused on backlights. Who the hell is spending $100+ on keyboards and can&#x27;t touch type?

Maybe, anyway; I have my doubts. But consider that <i>training</i> will never provide the same kind of endorsement as a liberal <i>education</i>--while reasonable, if perhaps short-sighted, people may disagree, for my money that&#x27;s a worse endorsement for creating well-rounded people who can be dropped into a foreign situation and thrive.<p>This criticism extends to the glorified tech-school approach of many bachelor-of-science degrees, thinking about it; I have a B.A. in computer science, not a B.S., and the most valuable classes I ever took, not just in my work life but my personal one, were microeconomics and political science.

That is information that should change the price, and that is the headline.  &quot;Anyone who says twitter being bought out is full of crap&quot; should also change the price based on the &#x27;reputation&#x27; of the people making the statements.<p>Regardless of order those price movements are central to the EMH, not contradictory, and they did in the order we would expect in such a way as to back up the weaker forms of the EMH.<p>So whether you buy the EMH, think even if it exists it doesn&#x27;t matter, or think it is complete nonsense.

Or if a 68K processor is for doing taxes or for doing word processing.<p>It has nothing to do at all with what kind of thing you are building, it is a general means of expressing common patterns in programs. Much of the reason people like FP is because it provides a high degree of code reuse in standardized forms, and it does so with a good bit of terseness and flexibility. Just about everything else in the FP world is about optimizing safety, performance, and reliability without giving up these benefits.<p>When someone says &quot;FP is good,&quot; it&#x27;s analogous to saying &quot;well-commented code is good.&quot; As in, it&#x27;s good everywhere you have the time to do it correctly.

    estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs
    should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect.
    The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the firebombing inflicted

    von Neumann&#x27;s first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader

For example, suppose you&#x27;re known for making great hamburgers. If you look at costs, you might say, &quot;Well, beef is our biggest expense, so let&#x27;s focus on reducing that cost.&quot; But the easy ways to do that reduce quantity and/or quality, which also reduce value delivered. Instead the thing to do is to focus on reducing <i>waste</i> or increasing <i>effectiveness</i>, both of which increase value delivered per dollar of expenses.<p>And the problem with adding control structures as a mechanism is that is slows everything down. You want employees asking, &quot;Am I doing the right thing for the company?&quot; rather than having them pray to the gods of the executive suite every time they need to make a decision.<p>I think a large part of what made Google so successful is that they approached most problems like engineers rather than MBAs.

Is it for a generally available car that can drive reasonably anywhere? In San Fransisco but also in small towns without super-accurate cm-scale mapping data (which will never be both everywhere and up-to-date)? Do we consider it a success if self-driving cars blindly drive into construction sites that haven&#x27;t been mapped? Or crash into newly erected barricades? Because I don&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s exactly where we&#x27;ll be in 15 years.<p>Autonomous vehicles are quickly approaching what I will acknowledge is probably an 80% solution. In nice weather, when their mapping is perfect in a perfectly-mapped area, and they have a good GPS signal, autonomous cars will work well (and currently are working well in testing).<p>That&#x27;s not the standard that&#x27;s expected. No one lives in a city without road work or construction going on. No one lives in a city where temporary or make-shift signs aren&#x27;t being erected, or where there are never detours, or where there isn&#x27;t ad-hoc communication going on between pedestrians and drivers, or where weather doesn&#x27;t block LIDAR, or, ...whatever.<p>We will be nowhere near level 4 autonomous vehicles in 10 years time. And not in 15 years, either.<p>No one in this field is confident of that anymore. Not even Google is making the same bold claims that they were 3 years ago.

It was because it was trying ipv6 first, but I of course didn&#x27;t have real ipv6 connectivity. I was more novice back then and I&#x27;m not sure what exactly in the OS or router pretended to have ipv6 connectivity. But this problem got worse with Windows Vista and &quot;Teredo&quot; automatic tunnels and 6in4 and various schemes.<p>Too often, these schemes don&#x27;t work close enough to 100% reliably, and then to be safe, ipv6 has to be <i>disabled</i>. In fact, ipv6 was enabled in early versions of Firefox and OS X, and then in later updates it was <i>disabled</i> because too many people unknowingly had <i>broken</i> ipv6 setups because of hare-brained &quot;transition aids&quot;. And then a couple years later they came up with &quot;happy eyeballs&quot; so they could turn ipv6 back on again.<p>The major transition over the past year is only due to major cable ISPs offering native ipv6 subnet broadcasts to consumer connections. So much for automatic tunneling, magic multi-homed public-ish 6in4 routers, etc. They added great amounts of complexity to ipv6 and delayed adoption because they were flaky.

Majority of young people proud about pre-Islamic history.(personally I don&#x27;t know about that area and I don&#x27;t have opinion)<p>By their &quot;own religion&quot; I mean secular religion, They believe in separation of religion and government at same time they believe on Islam.(some kind of old fashion Shia, before khomeini). At the other hand , we are having (or generating) serious hard liner in other side. People who hates religious, people who hate Islam.(you can search about Shahin Najafi , A singer who sentenced to death by Mullahs like Salman Rushdie)<p>In Iran despite of west media propaganda you can have every Idea you want in private and most of the time government will not hurt you if you pretend you are normal person in their definition.(You can be an alcoholic , You can be gay) <i>BUT</i> the serious issue here is ,the cost of doing anything other than regime says in PUBLIC is so so so high (most of the time death), and because of that people are afraid of make public their own identity. Just look at the page &quot;My Stealthy Freedom&quot; in facebook.Just imagine the level of government aggressiveness.Taking picture without scarf becomes heroic act here(just imagine , ridiculous thing like this is punishable).Because of this regime. But about saudi arabia , I can assure you Iranian people are far far secular than people at countries like saudi arabia.I can even claim they are secular than Turkye people. Last friday was a demonstration about Israel.The city I live in with population of 2 Million.They only managed to bring ~50,000.Thats all.This is serious defeat for this regime.Because this demonstration is so important for them (all ideology of regime hinges on resistance against US and Israel and for demonstration for showing this , only 1/40 come with all the money the spent).Every Military person have to participate,most of people works for non-military part of regime should too.But that&#x27;s all , 50 thousands for 2M city.(the important fact here is everybody who believe in regime politic will come to these demonstration , because these are so important for them)<p>The main problem here is in Iran we have a people-government spectrum , and they both are at other side. One is really aggressive and religious and the other side we have majority people with believe in freedom-secularism. The majority of ordinary and non-educated in people do not believe in religious-regime.",1436902766

I&#x27;m loathe to admit this as I used to think the &quot;free agent economy&quot; was the way to go, but I have to face the cumulative evidence over the past several decades.<p>Mainstreaming the freelance economy will be disastrous for median incomes, and further concentrate power because the majority of freelancers have little to no leverage. That is because by definition, the majority of freelancers fall somewhere close to some average metric (whatever objective/subjective measure is chosen by the buyer). That average is commoditized through many different means (the primary channel of delivering that commoditization being the purchasing/procurement department), and then the individual members of the average are pitted against each other. Everyone wants to think they are the special snowflake that will beat the averages, but by definition only a top 10-40% (depending upon a variety of factors) can beat the numbers.<p>My personal rule of thumb to staying a free agent for over the past ten years is assiduously put in the deliberate practice for 10K+ hours on a running 5-year basis constantly learning and applying new fields/skills/concepts, and successfully sell that (the key part many fall down upon). This is alongside the work you do to put bread on the table. My other rule of thumb is the moment you are negotiating a proposed gig&#x27;s technical deliverables through the purchasing/procurement bureaucracy instead of the business unit that will realize the benefits of the gig, you are losing large chunks of your agency to their buying process that acts as a highly lossy compression algorithm, if you haven&#x27;t lost it all already by that point.",1436901675

Indeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages &quot;do,&quot; in fact, reduce employment, but that the effects are small and swamped by other forces.",1436901639

9887308,comment,9884949,9886528,0,0,malandrew,,,"I&#x27;m mostly white and adopt a cisgender disposition, but identify as agender.<p>If you think this is a change in attitudes that is isolated to just reddit and hipmunk then you haven&#x27;t been paying attention.<p>There is someone with whom I work with or worked that often states/stated how much she hates|dislikes white guys|males|bros|dudes. Yes, those exact words or combination thereof. This happens/happened at least once a week if not more often. It is/was not even subtle or discrete. Sometimes these statements would be uttered aggressively in meetings with a bunch of people present. The culture in SV is such that everyone pretty much tolerates/accepts these statements. If the racial adjective where switched with any other to describe a different race and/or the gendered plural noun were switched for one that described women or anyone else on the gender spectrum, that person would already be talking to HR if not out the door already. Furthermore, this person is/was involved in hiring, which means it&#x27;s likely gender is a consideration in hire / no hire decisions made. If this isn&#x27;t toxic, then I don&#x27;t know what qualifies as toxic.<p>Another example of the toxicity of this was when I saw Rena Kopelman (of the Kopelman Foundation) giving a talk about how to increase diversity and opportunity for under-privileged groups. I was totally on board with a lot of the talk until she start railing against efforts to making it easier for talented individuals with the right skills to emigrate to the US in search of better opportunities in the US technology industry. I don&#x27;t see how an anti-immigration position does anything but further reinforce barriers that discriminate against those that didn&#x27;t have the privilege of being born in the right country.<p>In terms of privileges, my gender and race have been very very minor advantages. By far the number one privilege I enjoy is having had the opportunity to become a native English speaker despite the fact that English was not my first language. I moved to the states when I was four years old speaking another language, but I moved here early enough that no one can tell I&#x27;m not American. Speaking English and not having and accent is many times more advantageous than my gender. After that the privilege of having moved to and grown up in the US comes next (growing up in Western Europe would have also been advantageous, but not nearly as much as growing up in the US for the career I have). Next up comes growing up relatively affluent. Far behind those three would be being mixed race, but mostly caucasian (I got enough Anglo-Saxon genes to dominate the South American genes). Well behind my racial makeup is my gender. I actually can&#x27;t think of a situation where it was a factor in why I have the jobs I had. In my current job, I was referred to the recruiting department by a well known open source developer who works at the company. I got to know him and earned the recommendation by contributing to open source projects of his under a pseudonym.<p>If you are a US citizen (or Australian citizen because of the E-3 visa) and speak English natively, you are already far more privileged than most of the white males in the world in terms of getting a job in Silicon Valley.<p>Like I said in my other comment, my position here isn&#x27;t about me or any privileges I personally benefit from, but about the environment that is being fostered that my children will inherit once I decide to have a family. If I were about 50-55 years old today, that could be my daughter that gets a position in academia due to her gender or it could be my son that is turned down for position in Academia due to his gender. My position isn&#x27;t about &quot;us having a good run&quot; and trying to maintain that for my gender. I agree with the goals, but oppose the means being used to achieve it.<p>If you want to see other first hand examples of this toxicity in action, just go look up some op-ed pieces from The Advocate discussing the discourse around &quot;white male privilege&quot; from the perspective of a gay or bisexual white male. It&#x27;s entirely possible to be a white male and know what it is like to be discriminated against. If you happen to experience discrimination for other reasons besides your race and gender, you become aware of how the current attitudes of trying to solve discrimination with discrimination is toxic and counter productive as it breeds resentment and opposition from those who would otherwise be allies.<p><a href=""http://www.advocate.com/politics/commentary/2011/01/20/im-white-cisgender-gay-man"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advocate.com/politics/commentary/2011/01/20/im-wh...</a><p><a href=""http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2014/12/08/op-ed-privilege-and-advocacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2014/12/08/op-ed-privileg...</a><p><a href=""http://www.advocate.com/commentary/tyler-curry/2014/04/25/op-ed-grappling-what-people-see-my-privilege"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advocate.com/commentary/tyler-curry/2014/04/25/op...</a><p>I&#x27;m an ally of equality, but I am not an ally of those that adopt tactics to achieve equality like those being promoted by Steve Huffman.",1436901057

The same mechanism is likely in play here as well (it is an artifact of QCD) -- the idea is that hadronization can be energetically favorable to annihilation: since the gluons carry a strong charge (color), they participate in the interaction and can nucleate a light q/q-bar pair rather than requiring an additional (virtual) gluon to couple to the annihilation vertex.<p>(Also it does happen with non-quark particles as well!

C had libraries, but the standard library is very small compared to what Java and Python include.<p>> Historically there were no copyrights to source code prior to 1980.<p>There also wasn&#x27;t a good way to distribute, much less collaborate, on projects like we do today.  I think both the licensing and the new methods of distribution and collaboration.",1436900536

This is a hard business to build.  Providing consistent service in terms of restaurant relations, food quality, and delivery is non trivial.  Zesty is the best at it.  All of thedogeye&#x27;s points about the value of serving high quality meals to your team are spot on.  Congrats David, Chris and the Zesty crew!",1436900491

As an open source project, Eddystone gets lots of hardware support from vendors, but if developers want to give users the best experience and have an easier time themselves, they have to submit to the walled garden. Eddystone doesn&#x27;t need to be tied to Google though, and if developers want to use their own cloud solution or client API</i><p>This is a killer. This isn&#x27;t really open source at all [0]. Google controls the eco-system, and has most of the other vendors at its mercy (like how they flip search algorithms, give Google products a prominent listing in the search page, blacklist developers/websites etc). More than Search, its the mobile OS and API monopoly that Google is trying to build that&#x27;s going to hurt even more.<p>I work on AOSP, and I think it is ridiculous that Google owns so much of the eco-system [1] and continues to get praised for being &quot;open&quot; as well; very much like how this article seems to be praising them now.<p>Besides, whatever happened to proposing to a central body and getting stuff standardized (I get that its political and slow, and no ones like slow)? Google works with W3C to get stuff in the HTTP standard [2], with ECMA too [3], but seems to have problem engaging standards body for other things where it has a near monopoly. Not long after Chrome has taken over a large market share, Google would start treating W3C the same, if it hasn&#x27;t doing been that already [4].<p>[0] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/22/google-open-when-convenient/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/22/google-open-when-convenient...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-spdy-http-internet-w3c,news-13990.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-spdy-http-internet-w3c,ne...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.neowin.net/news/microsofts-pointer-events-becomes-w3c-standard-google-and-apple-play-hardball"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neowin.net/news/microsofts-pointer-events-becomes...</a><p><i>/rant /offtopic</i>",1436900469

Seems high to me.<p>BUT, if you add in the 50MM feral cats[2] as well, then the per-cat number is 30. Still seems high, but would make more sense if feral cats are disproportionately doing the killing (e.g. if feral cats kill 60 birds per year, and domestic cats kill 9)<p>The source for 3.7B[3] seems to actually be a range (1.4 - 3.7), and also estimates a cat population somewhere between 114MM and 164MM.<p>And at the end of all this verification, your point still stands, and it&#x27;s still <i>four</i> orders of magnitude more. It also makes me happy that my past cats didn&#x27;t decide to make a &quot;present&quot; out of every single kill.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-research-statistics-US-pet-ownership.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/Market-re...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/6/us-is-overrun-withmorethan50millionferalcats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/6/us-is-overru...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://phys.org/news/2013-01-cats-billions-birds-mammals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news/2013-01-cats-billions-birds-mammals.htm...</a>",1436900420

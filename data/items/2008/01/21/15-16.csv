101597,story,,,2,6,e1ven,"Is there a RSSlike standard for Posting? What about NNTP?",,"So often when I'm reading a blog or news site (Such as news.yc) in my feedreader, I wish I could easily read the full set of comments, or easily hit reply, and leave a comment right on the site.<p>I understand that the preferred model is to then ""push"" my reply to my own site, but it seems easier for everyone if there were a standardized API that could be used to posting replies to the site.<p>I'd also love to be able to read the various comments, fully thread them, and the like.. The Natural solution that comes to me is integrating a NNTP-like service into the popular website hosting software.. NNTP has allowed people to post replies and read through those of others easily for decades. It supports moderated on non-moderated posting, and it's lightweight enough to be supported everywhere.<p>Are there any other solutions that are in the works? Perhaps a simpler API that's based on HTTP post, rather than Sockets?<p>One of the main advantages of NNTP, is that it already has a HUGE base of Client Support- People have NNTP readers and don't even realize it.. Outlook, Thunderbird, Etc. What other app gets a huge installed base of users, who don't even realize they already have that functionality? ;)<p>I can understand reasoning that says that Spam might be a problem, but I have a hard time agreeing with it..\nFor one, there's technological fixes, such as HashCash, or even server-side IP filters.. Keep in mind, since each post goes back to the original server, who is running their OWN instance of NNTP, they can blacklist however they choose.<p>It seems like there's certainly an opportunity for this sort of development, I'm just curious if anyone knows someone working on it.<p>Unfortunately, I'm too busy approaching beta on Chron X to take on any new projects, but it seems like something desperately needed, and not a difficult technological problem.",1200931195

101594,comment,101571,101571,0,0,carpal,,,"1) I've never gotten much utility out of Rails books.  I've generally gotten much more use out of the API docs and blogs.  That said, the Agile Web Development with Rails book is pretty much standard, and Rails Recipes is good for code examples.  However, if you're doing something in Rails Recipes, there's probably a plugin for it by now.<p>2)  Because it is very easy to implement an idea in a day and see if it sticks.  More than that, when you're faced with a task that might not have much reward, it is easier to do if it doesn't feel like work.  Programming in PHP/Java/C#/etc generally feels like work.  Programming in Ruby generally feels like fun.",1200930826

101583,comment,101571,101571,0,0,ROFISH,,,"1) I've used the Agile Ruby on Rails book along with the free Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby online. (Cartoon Foxes!) I suggest checking out Why's Guide first and learn Ruby before you hit Rails. Ruby's a fairly easy language to learn while Rails is a totally different programming scheme you may be unfamiliar with (ActiveRecord).<p>Look at CakePHP to get familiar with ActiveRecord for PHP. I don't really recommend CakePHP as a development platform, but it's a great way to understand Rails if Ruby+Rails at the same time is too complicated.<p>2) My opinion of why RoR has taken off is because ActiveRecord makes normal day-to-day activities simple. Verification is already handled. Although PHP and Ruby are roughly equal in speed (Ruby 2.0 is going to be a lot faster though!), Rails isn't. But once you're done, built-in caching features help it scale at least a little bit. Of course if you're worried about scalability, just program the whole thing in C. :P (That's what Amazon does!)",1200929669

101573,comment,101445,101445,0,0,fendale,,,"Each request to Rails block a Mongrel while it servers it, but even on my home server I am getting upwards of 50 requests per second on my app (all logged in pages, so no caching).  That means you could have 50 people all requesting the page at the same time and each of them will have it returned inside a second even with a single Mongrel.<p>You need to be careful that you don't tie up some of your Mongrels doing long running tasks - if you have actions that cause tasks to run that take on the order of seconds, consider queuing them up to be serviced by some other background process (which is what I decided to do).<p>As someone else mentioned here, try to cache as much as possible - cached full pages take the load off Rails completely, cached fragments reduce the time to serve a request inside Rails, so you can get more from each Mongrel.  Make sure and not cache logged in pages though!<p>Other general advice for a database application - hit the database as little as possible - in Rails don't do things like:<p><pre><code>  @user = User.find(params[:id])\n  @products = @user.products.find(:all)\n  @profile  = @user.profile.find(:all)\n</code></pre>\nThat would result in 3 database queries, while this will do it in 1:<p><pre><code>  @user = User.find(params[:id], :include => [:products, :profile])\n</code></pre>\netc ...",1200928166

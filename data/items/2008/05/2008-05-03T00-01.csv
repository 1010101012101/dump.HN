While I don't think equity index funds will have higher risk-adjusted returns than any other asset class, they are still useful for diversification. By building a portfolio of uncorrelated or negatively-correlated investments, investors can somewhat reduce the total risk while retaining most of the gains. Personally I try to maximize the expected Sharpe ratio of my portfolio as a whole. This isn't exactly a buy-and-hold strategy; it requires rebalancing the portfolio whenever market moves cause the current asset allocation weights to drift too far from the target.",1209773891

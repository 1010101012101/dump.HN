I think the founder's statement came across as an unhappy ending (not what he envisioned, but that could have just been the way I read into it). It was a pretty cool interface for a photo site but unfortunately the most memorable thing I knew about the company was the drama with that teen from techcrunch trying to have the Divvyshot founder buy him a Mac to get favorable coverage on Techcrunch.com<p>I'm about to start work as a new employee at a YC alumni, hopefully we'll do better!",1271670982

Of course, almost any skill or desire can be learned, but everyone is born into this world with their own unique set of aptitudes and weaknesses. The unique amalgamation found in each person lends its owner to certain roles and stations in life where excellence is easier to achieve.<p>Some people are perfectly OK working for someone else. They enjoy the labor of it, they enjoy the pay, they enjoy the company, they enjoy the security and relative comfort and anonymity. It doesn't really bother them that someone else is making 3x more off of the work performed than they are. That's OK. There's all kinds of people who are OK with this idea, too, but believe me that it's much better for some types to remain content with this than to branch out.<p>Some people are not content with that setup. They want to change things, they want to control how they spend their time (i.e. no hard 9-5 commitment), they want to keep the money their labors produce, they want to direct and lead and organize and control the intelligences and powers for their ends. This is OK and good too.<p>There's just different types of people in the world. We need employees, both employees on the way to independence and employees who don't mind becoming company men. It's good to have both.<p>The real thing that should be universal is a plan to develop financial independence such that one is never forced to work a job after it turns south, and such that people do not have to live in fear of their bosses. Of course, many bosses get mad at this idea because it weakens their ability to control their employees.",1271669931

Using scanning software, you can take a picture of the barcode with your phone and the software will decode the image and invoke the appropriate action based on the data payload.  Our API is gaining a lot of traction with integrating with websites, and marketing campaigns and we now generate over 10M+ barcode impressions per month.<p>Please do let us know if you have any suggestions.

I realize they have a little Flickr widget on their homepage, but man they have the world's catalogue of amazing images and they really haven't done anything with it other than just keep it the same as it was, for the most part.<p>I think I understand how M&A teams at places like Yahoo! work. It's all about what's ""hot"" with maybe some fanciful vision of integration into Yahoo! in a way that will never happen. The M&A team is drinking the same koolaid they're selling to top level execs, founders and VC's of companies they're looking at, bringing a gigantic checkbook with them.<p>Zimbra was actually a good kind of acquisition, because they did a good job integrating it with Yahoo! Mail right away, and what you see today is derivative of that purchase. It made a lot of sense for Yahoo! to buy a fancy webmail interface since most people using Yahoo! use it for their email. Some other good examples of acquisitions are Google buying Android and Apple buying the chip manufacturer that led to the A4 for the iPad. Bad acquisitions are when it seems like it's about the buzz and it's hard to visualize how the purchase can help the bigger company. Those acquisitions go the way of Dodgeball and Jaiku.<p>Foursquare is a mobile company and Yahoo!'s (lousy) presence on mobile phones is restricted to un-installable bundled software deals like with AT&T on the Backflip. Yahoo! is not a mobile company, it's not the first, second, or even in the top ten or possibly not even in the top fifty companies you'll think of when someone asks you to name companies that are movers in the mobile space.<p>Foursquare isn't going to do well at Yahoo! because it doesn't make sense.<p>I usually don't like Arrington's rants, but this one was inspired.",1271669592

For example, deletion is as simple as rotating the node in question down until it is a leaf, then removing it. The rotations only need to preserve heap ordering, a much simpler invariant than the red/black one.<p>The standard description of the treap calls for a field in each node containing a random number, but you can eliminate that by just hashing the address of the node.

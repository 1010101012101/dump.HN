537041,comment,536865,536865,0,0,pieter,,,"Having a bugtracker or not is a tough decision. You have to keep your ways of communicating limited to a few channels. You _will_ need to address the social aspect of your project in one way or another. It's probably either a mailinglist or a bugtracker. Having both means one of them is probably heavily underused.<p>What you see a lot with projects is that everything happens through a bugzilla. New features, feature requests, bugs are posted there, some invalid because the user doesn't understand a program. The 'bugtracker' aspect forces you to put your message in a certain style.<p>With mailinglists like git@vger you get a mixture of posts. Some are from newbies that don't understand the system, some are comments on the current system and most of them are patches or status updates. Having a mailinglist allows a user more freedom in the form in which he wants to communicate, which lowers the barrier. You also get a nice mixture of users and developers on the same channel, by which you get better feedback.<p>The flipside of that is that you don't have any overview. You'll have to manage bugs yourself. If you want something fixed, you'll either have to make a patch yourself, get somebody else interested or just keep bringing the bug to attention.<p>Now compare this to a bugtracker. You post a bug there and nobody will look at it until you make a patch yourself, get somebody else interested or keep bringing the bug to attention. See the difference? Exactly.",1238294718
537040,comment,536958,537016,0,0,thwarted,,,"Both this, and kailashbadu's, are good points.  But so much of this rings of my mom telling me to ""get off the computer and go play outside"" (nevermind that my friends and I biked all over the city regularly, ran cross country in high school, was in the Boy Scouts, worked at the city library, worked at day camps, and participated in my community's summer youth programs--so it was more stereotypical mother complaining than legitimate concern) and the view that ""computers isolate us because there's less interpersonal interaction"", a view I know my parents and grandparents generations have had (and most likely continue to have).  And of course, that was back before the Internet, where the majority of time using a computer <i>was</i> largely isolating. Today, not so much.  I mean, we're having this conversation right now.",1238294612

However, if this line was meant to be taken seriously, then it displays a shocking level of ignorance regarding fundamental tools.

537029,comment,536639,536639,0,0,cmars232,,,"Back when I went to school (mid-90s), our computer lab was a bunch of orange-screen vt220s connected to a Vax cluster.  We didn't have fancy NCSA Mosaic like UT, we had Lynx and gopher.  We learned C on a VAX with a broken scanf.  Students dropped CS because they couldn't figure out EVE and EDT (visual editors).  Our internet connection came through a narrow tenuous pipe from UT Austin.  When it went down, I'd do a traceroute and then give ""Mordac"" over there at UT a hard time.<p>Oh yeah, there was a PC lab.  Running Windows 3.1.  That was a place to type your paper.  You couldn't do real CS there.<p>And I had to bike uphill to class both ways in the Texas heat. :)<p>I think if you can take busted up hand-me-downs and backwards old crap, make it work & explain how to others, and learn how to sidestep a lazy/stubborn/indifferent IT (build your own stuff in ~/local, etc.), you can adapt and do fine anywhere.",1238293104

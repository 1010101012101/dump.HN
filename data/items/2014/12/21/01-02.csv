Thank you all!<p>Background: I have a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Physics from a prestigious university in the UK. My work history (internships and current position) has primarily been geared towards finding employment in the more traditional careers - finance and so forth. It seems to me that the UK is a difficult place to come of age in nowadays - housing costs in particular are astronomical - at times I have felt that my hand is forced if I wish to ever provide myself and my family with a decent standard of living.<p>I would like to change direction and pursue a programming career. As many here can hopefully relate with I&#x27;ve spent my youth tinkering with computers and producing the odd tool here and there to deal with personal needs. I am increasingly starting to realise that in order to succeed one must find a job that they are truly passionate about - and also to be surrounded by colleagues who are similarly minded.<p>My question to you all is how I could go about achieving such a transition. US centric advice can only go so far, unfortunately.<p>My focus at present is on finding employment that will allow me enough flexibility / free time to contribute to open source projects in my downtime.<p>The question then - how does a beginner pursue a career in programming? Are there companies still willing to train new starters, or is the best approach to produce a solid portfolio of OSS projects/contributions?<p>Many thanks for any advice.",1419126752

8778657,comment,8777899,8778542,0,0,diydsp,,,"when I startup company I was at years ago started failing and laying people off, someone proposed unionizing to prevent it.  In the serious discussions that followed, many reasons came out.  I don&#x27;t agree with them all, but these were floated by people at that time:<p>1. Unions are about more than simply the jobs &#x27;n&#x27; wages.  There&#x27;s lots of favoritism, a whole new layer of politics beyond the question of &quot;who works enough to earn their paycheck&quot;.<p>2. There was insufficient inertia.  A chicken and egg problem.  No one was used to unions and no one knew exactly what to do or how to determine if it was being done properly.<p>3. Some people were uncomfortable having a more exact spotlight shone on their work.  In more physical, less individualized jobs like plumbing, pipe-fitting, etc., people are more interchangeable and less mysterious.  Programmers at this company preferred to endure the risk of layoff rather than have their art/handiwork/craftwork get recast as something that another individual could do just as well.<p>4. At least in the startup we were in, failure was more of an anticipated outcome than other professions.  Unlike a tradesman, most of us didn&#x27;t invest our whole lives in a set of skills with a known or &quot;background&quot; level of demand.  iow, many of us just said &quot;fuck it&quot; and went to a new startup or a new white collar job.<p>5. Elitism: At least some people viewed unions as something &quot;lower-class&quot; people have to do to earn their wages.  Some people at this company felt they were of high class and didn&#x27;t need &quot;lower&quot; themselves by unionized.  (yes the cognitive dissonance here is strong).<p>Personally, I still don&#x27;t know the answer, but it can only help us to give these objections some thought from time to time in considering the next several decades of our trade.",1419125825

8778651,comment,8778503,8778594,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"One of the essential tensions of being a software developer is the fact that software isn&#x27;t really useful on its own. It has to do something. That thing it&#x27;s doing is the domain. Whatever very-specific information that the software system is organizing and passing, more specifically.<p>For example, I maintain an e-commerce system. More specifically, I maintain an e-commerce system built for a cosmetics company.  E-commerce is a field, cosmetics is a field, cosmetics e-commerce is specifically the domain I need to become an expert in. The more I can differentiate cosmetics e-commerce from other kinds of e-commerce, the more well-tailored I can make my app. And the more well-tailored I can make this app, the better I&#x27;ll be able to understand the more general case of making custom e-commerce systems for other industries.<p>The more I go through this process of understanding the specific needs of the industry, the more domain expertise I&#x27;m building. Domains can subdivide as much as industries subdivide. Say the cosmetic industry started to split along product lines, then I might start gaining insight into how lipstick companies operate, and be able to tailor a product offering straight to them.<p>The domain doesn&#x27;t have to mean commercial industry. You might have domain expertise, say, in XML parsing. Then you could wax poetic on the differences between Nokogiri and say, Chrome&#x27;s internal parser.<p>So, essentially, it just means &quot;expertise&quot;. More specifically, the type of expertise that allows you to customize a software system around it. Which can be in practice quite different from normal expertise. The guy who devises our makeup formulas is definitely an expert.<p>But he can&#x27;t design the system to actually manufacture it. The guy who writes those systems might not understand the actual formulas, so the two types of experts have to work together.<p>When startups talk about the need to be a domain expert, it means getting out of just pure programming and into the actual meat. Rather than hire an expert, to become one yourself. This not only allows you to reduce staff, it also makes it easier to make better, more custom solutions. The Soylent guys have to make the system to manufacture their product, but they also must understand nutrition, food, the regulatory environment of the food market.",1419125747

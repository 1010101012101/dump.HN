Within about an hour of the first public disclosure, bots started scanning for it: some white hat, others not so much. Big websites are seeing scans from bots run by 50 or more different unrelated entities at the moment. It&#x27;s really easy for just about anyone to hack together a quick script that scans for and exploits this vulnerability.<p>This is not to fear monger though: for 99.9% of web applications out there, the scans will not find anything vulnerable to Shellshock. Unless you&#x27;re running a CGI app, you generally won&#x27;t have to worry from a web app perspective even if you are vulnerable. You may have to worry if you host a Git or SVN repo, or expose a mail daemon, etc.<p>It&#x27;s nice of you to inform the admin but unfortunately compromised servers running Plesk have been used to serve malware for many years now.

Therefore, most of us will end up working for other companies. Statistically again, there are a lot more employees in well established companies than startups so most of us will likely end up working for well established/large organizations.<p>So my question is: does the experience, the knowledge I learn from startups helps me on my probably eventual job in an established company? Should I just go work for a large company right away so I can be good at what I will end up doing?

Which means I would have little use for reddit as a whole, aside from the occasional time wasting when I had nothing better to do.<p>Moderation is what allows for decent content to exist outside of the trivially small sub-reddits. There are plenty of places on reddit to view shallow content (in fact, I would say the vast majority of the content on reddit is of the shallow variety). The existence of more heavily moderated sub-reddits doesn&#x27;t prevent these places from existing, but it does allow for sub-reddits to deviate from the norm.<p>So, to summarize, moderation is what allows me to view the type of content on reddit that I would like to see.

Probably a disgruntled[+] employee making stuff up knowing it will never be confirmed or denied. I knew at the time about Constitutional protections and all that, and thought well surely someone up there on top wouldn&#x27;t allow something this blatant to happen.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be surprising if Snowden studied Binney and learned the lesson of how &quot;all they had to do is come and tell their superiors and there was no need for all the public disclosures&quot; is a bunch of bullshit. Binney did that. Also Binney didn&#x27;t get any proof or documents with him. Can&#x27;t help but think Snowden learned from that too.<p>Wonder what is the lesson to be learned by next Snowden who is probably already planning his actions. Try to stay completely anonymous? Fly directly to Brazil for a warmer weather?<p>Maybe the ultimate lesson we learned then and now is how little people care. NSA learned that too and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if instead of dialing down the level of these programs they will crank it up. Why wouldn&#x27;t they? They have clear tested proof that the public doesn&#x27;t mind that much. No need to play the Constitutional farce any more.<p>[+] It would seem Binney was a bit disgruntled since his system was re-purposed (stolen) and he was pushed to the side. There was an interview where he talks how after 9/11 NSA was on a lockdown, and he snuck in to work and saw all this hardware everywhere. And eventually found out it was to be used for his re-purposed system. But without him on onboard. It was handed over to contractors.",1412135378

While it’s true that the government wiped JNR’s debt, that debt was predominantly operating losses before restructuring; since JNR got few subsidies, it had to keep borrowing to cover its losses.  Construction was only one eighth of the debt burden, and that part the JRs did have to pay.[1]  In other words, the government really just subsidize JNR’s operating losses from its inefficient pre-restructuring days.&quot;<p>[1] From Wikipedia: JNR&#x27;s Shinkansen-fueled debt eventually ballooned to ¥28 trillion [...] The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of only ¥9.2 trillion to acquire JNR&#x27;s Shinkansen network.",1412135372

There&#x27;s no indication in the article that anybody associated with the project had any manufacturing experience. Or prototyping experience. Or even basic machine shop skills.<p>&quot;With the funding closed, Factorli is setting out to buy a whole bunch of equipment, and also to build software that helps all the systems talk to each other and work at full capacity.&quot; That&#x27;s a hard, but mostly solved, problem. There are commercial solutions from most of the CAD vendors.  The ones that do the whole job almost automatically are not cheap.  (Here&#x27;s what you get at the high end, for $22,000 per seat, using a $700K 5-axis mill: &quot;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knuz38oT2kc&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knuz38oT2kc&quot;</a>)  If you&#x27;re prototyping electronics, there are already services that do that.  That&#x27;s mostly a remote business; you send in files in standard formats and get electronics back.<p>Similar services are available for machined parts. See &quot;emachineshop.com&quot;.  They have a cute little free CAD program which understands what they can make, and will price the job for you, giving advice on how to cut the manufacturing cost.<p>There&#x27;s a serious effort at Octopart to standardize the parts and process for building little computer-interfaced devices, so the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; crowd doesn&#x27;t have to do so much original engineering for each new product.  They might have gotten on board with that.<p>Another solution would have been to buy a TechShop franchise.  Then, alongside that, set up some services which make prototypes using TechShop facilities.  Such things have grown up around other TechShop locations, although with only modest success.<p>It&#x27;s disappointing that this outfit produced nothing.",1412133910

There is an infinitesimal but still nonzero chance of an honest-to-god epidemic. But medical institutions and the federal government have wargamed all sorts of epidemic scenarios in the decade and a half of OMG ANTHRAX/SMALLPOX/H-N-SOMETHING-SOMETHING panic we&#x27;ve endured.<p>Even in the (vanishingly unlikely) worst case scenario, state and local authorities have <i>extremely</i> expansive authorities to impose and enforce isolation and quarantines, violation of which (in Texas) is a third-degree felony. (CDC, under HHS delegation, can also impose quarantines to prevent interstate spread of disease, but generally this is left up to the state.) Dallas and surrounding communities could enforce a quarantine and let the outbreak burn out that way, although the economic cost would be enormous. But even mid-tier nations like Nigeria -- which spends per-capita 1% of what the US does on its health system, and which has what could be charitably described as a less-effective government -- have been able to stop Ebola cold with far less drastic action.<p>In truth, the greater threat comes from citizens who could mob doctors&#x27; offices and ERs, demanding nonexistent ZMAPP cocktails for garden-variety seasonal flu symptoms. Unsurprisingly, there&#x27;s not much medical surge capacity in most hospitals, and beds and labs are in chronically short supply. Health system resource consumption by scared but non-sick patients is a far more likely cause of mortality than an Ebola outbreak.",1412132514

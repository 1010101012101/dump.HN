At the same time, more people today want and can afford cars and other expensive things. Thus, even though we are constantly using resources more efficiently, you are competing with more people for resources today than your father in the fifties.<p>This is natural and a good thing: If Earth can't sustain very many people buying cars every 2 years, then we can't buy new cars every 2 years. We have to use resources more efficiently. It's a similar situation with fuel: For a long time, we built stronger engines that consumed the same amount of fuel, instead of building engines that used less fuel for more efficient use. Later that trend reversed. A similar thing happened with computers and their energy use.<p>I hope my kids won't have to buy more than one car in their life.",1308085185

You can deploy web apps in Rails without adopting all of these things, but you will never be respected by Rails developers (I've heard devs say ""that's not the Rails way"" countless times). Usually these conventions are chosen for good reasons (even though they frequently change), but impose a significant cost since you have to learn:<p>(1) Ruby the language<p>(2) Idiomatic Ruby as perceived by Rails Devs<p>(3) Rails conventions<p>(4) Appropriate plugins/addons<p>All of them take a decent amount of time to learn (well). 3 & 4 also change pretty frequently.<p>So, it is possible you ""grok"" everything quite well (I'd guess that you do), but haven't learned all the specifics that make things tick the ""Rails way.""",1308084939

2654718,comment,2653326,2654595,10,0,srean,,,"> A person doesn't get better from a visit, they get better by being left alone with medicine.<p>A possible rephrasing of the sentence above would be that, putting someone suffering from a protracted disease into a solitary confinement with medicine is the path to betterment. I don't think it works that way. There is a reason why even otherwise healthy person are not held in solitary confinement unless as an act of (sometimes disguised) punishment.<p>You mentioned that emotional health is an elusive concept. It is not, it can be measured, and the measure stands up to a quality that is acceptable to the disciplines of empirical sciences. I think your hesitation to acknowledge it, stems from the fact that it can be defined significantly by the person/patient, while that is true, it does not make it elusive. Many people can voluntarily control waves emitted by the brain. The fact, that brain signals can be so controlled, does not make epilepsy a fictitious condition.<p>>Depending on others to feel good is not the sign of a mentally healthy person.<p>EDIT: Responding here to prevent deeply nested threads. By your standards most humans  would be unhealthy. The need for social interaction is well documented, and not only among humans. I am an introvert so I get by fine with a level of interaction low enough that it might bother someone else, but that does not mean that those who need it are unhealthy. There is a full spectrum and both extremes are considered deviant.<p>>I thought it was apparent that social interaction shouldn't be necessary to get better.<p>EDIT2: I think that's the crux of the argument/disagreement.
Social interaction has been deemed a <i>necessity</i> to well being. Can someone not recover from a disease without interaction, sure some can if it can be cured in a short enough duration, no otherwise. Does everybody need the social interaction to get better (stay well)? No, a percentage can do without it. In fact some spiritual school of thought see that to be the ultimate and difficult to attain target frame of mind.",1308084920

I wrote the Hoshi ( <a href=""http://github.com/pete/hoshi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/pete/hoshi</a> ) gem to address this, and used it in the last Rails application I wrote (still in production), and still use it for HTML when I need that.

Make a place where copy goes, decide on a markdown format, and write a helper that pulls in and processes that text.  Even if the coders are writing the copy, it's helpful to have the text seperate, and easier to edit besides.  And if it turns out that you need the text editable via a web UI or something, it makes the change easier:  modify the helper to fetch text by name from the database rather than the filesystem, and import all of the text into the database.  Everything is easier all around; I'm at the point where it looks like a code smell when I see walls of text (or frequently edited text) in a template.",1308083799

Source: ""Enviro Trends: Poor to Bear Brunt of Climate Change""</i><p>If you think those quotes are FUD or ""disinformation"", please make your case. They seem pretty sensible to me.

I'm guessing my knowledge re: authentication has a half-life of approximately 1.5 years.<p>The implications are as follows:<p>(1) If you are a Rails developer you need to be a full-time Rails developer and not do too much else.

2654539,comment,2654010,2654396,6,0,scarmig,,,"Let's say we could kick it down the road 50 years--I don't believe a mini-Ice Age is coming either, and even if it is NASA for one expects it to counteract only around seven years of carbon emissions. So this is all a bunch of pointless hypotheticals. But bear with me.<p>50 years from now, assuming around 2% annual global growth (a conservative guess), the world will be over two and a half times richer than it is now. We'll have had 50 years of technological advancement. Given that right now the biggest roadblocks to dealing with climate change are (a) the very real costs of mitigation and (b) the lack of technological ability to cost effectively generate carbon-free energy and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, there's a decent case on the face of it that we'd be more able to deal with it, notwithstanding the couple hundred extra ppm of CO2 we'd have to worry about.<p>Part of my motivation is also that I'm increasingly pessimistic about us getting our shit in order in the present day. The current radically corporatist administration in the USA gives only lip service to the problem, and the opposition... well, the less said about the opposition, the better. So if the hand we're dealt is that we have to deal with climate change in the present, we're pretty much fucked. Kicking it down the road would at least offer some hope.",1308082157

You sign a form saying ""For reals, I know this may kill me, but I'm not going to sue you unless you do something crazy like jam a fork in my head during the procedure.""<p>That should be enough, right?<p>But it's not. Because if things really do go badly, many patients in our sue-happy country will say ""well I knew it was risky, but I didn't know HOW risky!"" And the patient may win the suit - maybe justifiably, maybe not. But doctors know this and will be cautious. So that's one contraint on you getting to try whatever you want.<p>Secondly, say things go badly and the patient is horribly hurt but not killed. Now he/she needs expensive medical treatment every day. Is the government going to pay for that? Surely your waiver can't also waive Medicare? So the government (meaning me and my tax dollars) also have some interest in not letting you undergo any procedure you want.<p>If you could really, truly waive all your rights to recourse and help, maybe you could get any procedure you want.

2654506,comment,2654018,2654018,1,0,michaelperalta,,,"This idea, like the other comments said, has been beaten to death so much I am not sure why its still a discussion. I mean its common sense that the idea is less important than the execution. If we created companies off ideas alone we would have flying cars or time travel. Obviously this is an exaggeration and on the far end but its true. Every idea is a branch of something else, every idea is a combination of two other ideas. Every idea that you come up with may not be unique but what the idea actually indicates, and this is something Paul Graham said himself is the idea is a sign of the entrepreneurs intelligence. I believe thats true the idea should be viewed just as that, a sign of the thought process and the way they look at the work because I myself know that the initial idea I create is not the idea that I have three days from now. Idea's constantly evolve just organically in life and with different interactions you have which give way to even better ideas. The idea is not what wins its the ability to have a coherent and good idea and continue evolving with it. ""Your idea is not special"" is true because we as humans are for the most part not original creatures and our inspiration comes from other things but what is special is the way you continue to evolve the idea and how you take new ideas that you have and meld them into your original idea. Pandora is a great example, they did not start out as a internet radio company but as the music genome project and overtime changed focus to what they are today.",1308081641

Mining the content of emails can give you information about what's in them and the person who wrote them.  Examples are any spam filter, POPFile, GMail ads., automatic email response systems.<p>2. Email also contains relationship information.  And this information doesn't need to be gathered by forcing the user to 'friend' people.<p>If you have access to the email box of a user you have all their email which means all their relationships plus all the subjects they are interested in.   If you then do that across a company (or another group) you have a great deal of information for clustering (both by relationship and by content).<p>You also have IP addresses which leads to physical location (with some degree of error) and time information (including time zones).<p>That's a great deal of information to have (for example, companies like Facebook would love to know as much about you as possible but only really get the friend relationship; email gives you that effortlessly with content th analyze).<p>The obvious follow up on this is 'how are they going to make money'.  I don't know Xobni so I can't answer for them, but if you look at the areas where money as been made analyzing content or relationships, it's not hard to see that Xobni could be a trojan horse (an Outlook or other email pluging) that gives the user some value while providing greater value behind the scenes.",1209736101

Their opinions were that:<p>1) People in that sector don't really understand why this is a big deal.<p>2) It looks like just another ""Breakthrough"" in hi-tech; which is to say, a regular every-day occurrence. The fact that all articles point to nothing coming to the market for at least five to ten years also means that finance people aren't interested in the tech yet.",1209735755

Don't you think MS investigated the company first, it's offerings and it's future before making an offer?  I own a startup and think it could be worth billions someday... does that make it so?",1209735628

179463,story,,,12,51,epi0Bauqu,"Ask YC: How do you invest your money for long term growth?",,"There have been various side investing discussions in various threads. Here is one straight on for usefulness and clarity.<p>I realize investing is very case by case, so here's a (I hope relevent) case:<p>--Assume you have a good sum of money to set aside (and not touch) for three decades.<p>--The main goal with this money is for long term growth.<p>--Assume it is enough money where dividing it up at the 1% level makes sense.<p>--Assume it is enough money where your access to desired investments is possible and makes sense.<p>--Speak in %s so it easily translates, e.g. I would put x% in commodities.<p>If I'm missing anything to make this a good question, please clarify.<p>And if your strategy involves more actively assessing things from time to time, please also include what it tells you to do right now.",1209735215

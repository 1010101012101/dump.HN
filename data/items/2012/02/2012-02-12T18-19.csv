But Clojure took a minimalistic language, then made a few very tactical departures from minimalism - common data-structures have native syntax encouraging people to use more than just lists, and the native data structures are immutable encouraging a functional style. from this we learn that minimalism is a great base, but the langage forms opinions about what code should look like via its syntactical choices, and these opinions shape its community, libraries and ultimately its success. language designers must take this into account.<p>with that said, you can do ""concatenative"" programming in any language supporting a functional style (python, ruby, clojure, haskell, javascript), and some of these languages (clojure, haskell) encourage or force functional style. clojure and haskell have different opinions about how this should be done, but they are opinions, not gospel, and each has their use for different problem domains and personalities.<p>the author makes some assertions that a ""concatenative"" language, one that encourages a concatenative style, are better than functional languages. i don't think these opinions were adequately backed up at all - i'm not just skeptical, i sort of think he's wrong. both clojure and haskell strongly encourage composition over application. these languages already have concatenative opinions. i don't really see the fuss here, i don't see the need to introduce more metaphors into an ecosystem which is already unfriendly to noobs. what we need is a language as noob friendly as python which has functional opinions. ruby got noobs using lambdas without realizing it, but ruby also has some weird opinions about magic which the functional community frowns upon. there's a clear niche here.<p>[1] (edit for gruseom) but we can try to learn from those who are successful, especially those who failed a few times first.

3582585,comment,3582261,3582500,12,0,dkersten,,,"I always liked this (slightly paraphrased) quote:<p><pre><code>    Idiomatic Factor does not (explicitly) use the stack.
</code></pre>
That is to say, in Factor, a popular concatenative language, you tend to use higher order functions and high level combinators instead of manually shuffling stuff around on the stack. Sure, from time to time you still need to move stuff into the right place, but its easy to keep track of the stack if you only need to consider two or three items. At least, that seems to be the theory - I have not used Factor in a number of years so don't know how well that holds up in practice.<p>Also, Factor does allow you to use local (named) variables and infix syntax when it makes more sense to do so. Concatenative languages do not <i>need</i> to be unreadable at all and for some things I think the concatenative code is actually more naturally readable.<p>""<i>If c consumes two arguments, in applicative terms it would be d(c(b, a)); if b consumes one argument and c only one, then it would be d(c(b(a))); if d consumes two arguments, b one, and c none, then it would be d(c, b(a)).</i>""<p><i>'a b c d'</i> in a concatenative language is akin to <i>'a | b | c | d'</i> in a shell script (where a stack is being threaded from function to function) or <i>'d(c(b(a(STACK))))'</i> in most languages where each function has a type <i>'Stack func (Stack s)'</i>. It doesn't change depending on how many arguments a function takes off the stack - its always <i>'d(c(b(a(STACK))))'</i>. Of course, since literals are essentially functions which push their value onto the stack, what you say is true if <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> are literals. I don't find this nearly as confusing as what it sounds like from your comment.<p>In code like '1 2 + print', all the words you see are functions. 1 pushes the value of 1 onto the stack and so on. This is interesting because you can easily factor out any part by replacing it with a new word that calls the replaced word:<p><pre><code>    :A 1 2 + print
    
    :add2 2 + ;
    :B a add2 print
</code></pre>

Sometimes this behavior is intuitive, other times it can be deeply confusing.<p>For what it's worth, my experience is that practice and good factoring can make concatenative languages much less cryptic. In Forth, the ideal size of a procedure is about a line, and procedures that take more than three arguments are considered a ""code smell"" that suggests a different factoring might be more appropriate. When you only care about the top few stack elements within any given definition there's a lot less to juggle mentally.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedenc...</a>",1329072332

I find it difficult to track the exact stack effects of each word (function), particularly if these functions are pushing, popping and applying functions that themselves modify the stack. Even when dealing with something as simple as optimized x87 code, I would annotate all the FXCH etc. to keep track of the bits of the arithmetic expression on the stack, as I tried to keep multiple operations in flight.<p>Yes, I know Christopher Diggins' Cat is statically typed. The problem isn't in compiler diagnostics, it's in readability.<p>In a stack language, an expression as simple as 'a b c d' is cryptic. If c consumes two arguments, in applicative terms it would be d(c(b, a)); if b consumes one argument and c only one, then it would be d(c(b(a))); if d consumes two arguments, b one, and c none, then it would be d(c, b(a)). And this ambiguity makes it very hard for me to read the code unless I'm intimate with all the individual words. You have to understand everything to understand anything.<p>Unfortunately, I suspect that concatenative languages tend to derive their power from this ambiguity, because the lack of specificity leaves considerable flexibility for what the words can do with the stack.<p>So my considered opinion for now - and this article doesn't really change that, it is mostly a tutorial - is that stack languages are best as a compiler target rather than a human source form.",1329071171

However, none of it is about what you actually do.  It's about the ""ritual"", the only time you do it is in preparation for the work and after enough repetitions it snaps you straight in.  For snapping out, any time I spend a significant (or feels like it) amount of time trying to solve an issue and can't, I save everything, hit compile and get up from my desk.  I prefer to step outside, relax for like 10-15 minutes not doing anything work related except maybe chatting about work with folks, and then go back.  Getting up, away from the computer and letting the brain relax is what I consider the most important part.  Sitting in the same place where you had the problem never let me relax enough to get through it without lots of effort/time.

On the CPF secondary market it could easily go for more than that. There are also a couple other business that sell parts and accessories for custom flashlights who survive almost solely from the patronage of CPF members. See The Sandwich Shoppe: <a href=""http://theledguy.chainreactionweb.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theledguy.chainreactionweb.com/index.php</a> [Warning: Truly terrible design]<p>The more I think about it people will dump tons of money into their very niche hobbies. And the internet has only recently given people with niche interests a place to gather and hawk their projects and products. Look at how successful  Kickstarter has been, doing something similar. I don't have any idea how much money Kickstarter itself is making, but they have certainly enabled people to make a decent profit on their projects that may otherwise never see the light of day.<p>I agree there is certainly money to be made in these extremely narrow niche markets, but is it really a sustainable living? I ran a couple projects selling flashlights or flashlight pieces on CPF, and I always broke even or made money, but I certainly couldn't have made a living doing it.<p>I've never seen McGizmo's financials, but I assume he makes a good chuck of change. However, I think he is the exception. He has set himself apart from everyone else and can charge whatever he wants. Maybe thats an answer to the original question in its own way too. But I really think people like McGizmo and PhotonFanatic make flashlights because they love flashlights, so its ok if they aren't making a ton of money doing it, but if they do, even better.

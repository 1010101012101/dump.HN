Often some of the updates don&#x27;t start or finish, and the app becomes unusable unless you go to some lengths to fix it.<p>Then there are also the lengthy approval times for new app version submissions.  Having to wait a week or more (and when Apple doesn&#x27;t misplace your submission in their queue) is outlandish compared to the [more open] Google Play App Store where updates can go live in just a couple of minutes.  Apple&#x27;s walled garden is not fun to develop for.  Every step along the way is painful compared to Android.<p>At SendHub, we have both Android and iOS apps.

If something went wrong with the latest release, it&#x27;s not too big of a drama to roll it back.  With Apple, we&#x27;ve ended up in nightmarish scenarios where something slipped past our QA and went live, and we had to call in special one-time favors to get the bad version rolled back.<p>The bottom line is that Android, while far from perfect, has a more developer friendly ecosystem which allows devs to do what they&#x27;re good at: writing code, creating apps, and pushing out updates without a lot of fuss.",1379734148

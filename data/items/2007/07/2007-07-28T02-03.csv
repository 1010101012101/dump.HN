To me the licenses found in the Creative Commons accommodate this. They give you the licensing tools to flexibly control content and can let users to share content. Safe that in the knowledge competitors do not have the copyright rights to use/abuse licensed content without recourse to the law (in a lot of cases with laws adopted in your home country). <p>You cannot however use CC for 'facts and ideas' (as per CC FAQ, <i>How does a Creative Commons license operate?</i>) ~ <a href=""http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ</a> <p>Having said that I know of no known tools or tool sets to automatically check for content, it's licensing (if any) and contact details for buyers. Buyers would grab at this seeking for <i>free</i> content (images for instance) clear of any copyright issues.<p>If you really don't want competitors (are your users competitors as well?) to take away your content then don't create API's allowing users to use their own content. But then you risk making another ""Roach Motel"" allowing users to create but not export.  Is this what you mean, lockout of users data?",1185588465

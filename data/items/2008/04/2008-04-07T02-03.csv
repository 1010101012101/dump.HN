156623,comment,156177,156177,0,0,ericwaller,,,"A negative income tax seems to me like a generally good, if naive, solution.<p>Of course the problem is that a straight forward negative income tax creates a resistance level where each additional dollar earned is worth less and less. The simple negative income tax leads to the situation in the 1970's study mentioned in the article (people are discouraged from working).<p>I think the solutions lies in creating support levels, or income targets. I.e. $15k or less is taxed at 0%, $15k - 20k at -5%. This would establish a support level at $15k.<p>I can even imagine a system where meeting an ""income goal"" (support level) one year triggers a higher one for the next year. I.e. if you make $16k in 2008 and are taxed at -5%, you must make $20k in 2009 to receive the -5% rate again, otherwise you'll be taxed at 0%.<p>Eventually, if the person keeps meeting income targets, they'll no longer be poor (by definition).",1207536737

One thing I do in that regard is make liberal use of mp3s, to listen to lectures, novels, nontechnical stuff (although I am listening to the complete Feynman Lectures on mp3!).

It is unusual, but it works eventually. It is not meant for deep understanding though. Kind of like reading something and only getting the highlights (albeit very detailed highlights).",1207534720

Interesting how since writing this article, Stevey's flipped on two points:<p>1) Javascript went from a ""language you're stuck with"" to the ""next big language"".<p>2) Here he has a hunch that, basically, Java is the best language for building large systems, and a dynamically typed, interpreted language probably would fail. Now at Google, he's certainly seen large systems done in Python, he uses Ruby everywhere he's allowed, and he's rewritten Rails and Wyvern in Javascript.<p>And he never explains why Lisp might be a special case.",1207533994

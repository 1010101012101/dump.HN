For those of us that aren&#x27;t Capital One customers, we do have to pay, because the Capital One service you use is not available to us. It&#x27;s not some web service like PayPal we can sign up for on a whim either; opening a 360 account with Capital One requires an application, a credit check, an existing checking account with another bank, etc.",1390464951

They move so fast from page to page, all they notice is WHETHER OR NOT the page lives up to its purpose.  That&#x27;s the start and end of their experience and it&#x27;s all over in literally a second.<p>Is the user expecting to read an article?<p>If so, then they will simply be blind to anything that isn&#x27;t the title and text of the article.  If they do notice something that isn&#x27;t the article, you&#x27;ve probably intruded on their experience --- either with an ad, or a fixed element, or a sudden splash page &quot;subscribe for more great content&quot; ... and they don&#x27;t care about the four CSS effects that will trigger on parent and child elements in your nav on :hover.  They won&#x27;t notice.<p>So get over it!  Design simple pages.

If I didn&#x27;t use Google DNS, they&#x27;d be able to track 90-99% of my internet usage just by watching what domains I visit in chrome.  The remaining portion is e.g. irc, usenet, xmpp, ssh, etc, that doesn&#x27;t go through chrome.  I could use firefox or opera or w3m or telnet or whatever, but I like chrome.<p>2.

I personally use a gant chart and any other planning docs that make sense when scheduling a project.  It helps to make my case for cutting features and convincing management of things that we can delay to a 1.1 update.  I find that people respond pretty well when I can show them a visual chart with sensible looking numbers and they can also see how hard everybody will be working.  I also have a few tricks for figuring out which things can be delayed without a major impact on a launch.  For example if your system will automatically bill customers monthly - then you have 30 days after launch to get the automated billing working and nobody will know the difference!  Lot&#x27;s of little admin things like that can be delayed without customers or management even noticing that you are cutting features.<p>I&#x27;m pretty much a stickler for trying to get things done without ever going beyond our standard work week hours.  It&#x27;s usually pretty tough the day or so before a big launch for everybody though - not just the programmers.  Somewhat human nature I suppose - some unplanned thing always reveals itself at the last minute.",1390464582

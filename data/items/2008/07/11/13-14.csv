243495,comment,243134,243187,0,0,mdasen,,,"A simple, non-computer example.<p>You are checking people in at a conference registration booth.  You have people with last names A-M in line one and N-Z in line two.  You have just sharded the registration forms by last name.<p>The Pro is that it's a lot faster to get people registered.  The person at the desk has to seek between roughly half the records.  The Con is that the person at the desk can't easily/elegantly get a record not in their grouping.  For example, a couple comes up where they have different last names (John Jones and Jane Smith).  You can't check them both in without bothering the person next to you and making the process slightly cludgy.<p>How does this apply to databases?  Well, if you have a users table that is sharded, some users are in DB1 and others are in DB2.  You can't simply join across the different servers.  That's the big con to sharding.  You lose the ability to join.  There are things you can do, but they're cludgy.<p>The good thing to take away from this is that, unlike the conference check-in, databases are really good and fast.  You don't need to shard as quickly as you do with humans.  When you start getting a high level of concurrent activity, you can add replication.  Once you've exhausted that, only then should you think about sharding.  Without sharding, you can create large sites, but you'll get to a point where you need to start thinking about it - you're not at that point (not that I am).  Twitter is at that point and handling it poorly.  Really, if you get that big, you'll have the money to hire someone who knows what they're doing.",1215782531

I don't think Apple is interested to start selling chips. And I wouldn't want Intel to basically be the only chip manufacturer for non-Apple hardware. As a consumer I care about competition and I think IBM would be more likely to be able compete with Intel than Apple.<p>Furthermore, it doesn't seem to make sense for Apple to buy AMD since they ([Apple]; correct me if I'm wrong) seem to put more emphasis on mobile processors, and there Intel is ahead of AMD now and probably for the foreseeable future.",1215782121

It would lead to a housing depression, and during an election year, is not good for the incumbent.<p>Also, it would set up a string of revaluations on credit default swaps, which there are about 4 trillion dollars worth floating around in an unregulated market. So the two companies will probably get nationalized, along with a government bailout of Lehman brothers.<p>It's funny to see everyone fight against the free market when it goes against them. Freddie and Fannie are shit. They have been shit. When they raised the loan limits to 750,000 a couple months ago, it just allowed them to pile on more shit. The bad loans coming out of California could be repackaged and sent to these companies at the taxpayer's expense.<p>These companies are overleveraged, poorly managed, unhedged, and are running out of cash. The only reason they're solvent is that they value their asset classes way above what they can get on the market right now.<p>Unfortunately, we have to bail them out. If we didn't, it would take down our financial system. But the actions of the Fed and the Treasury create a behavioral incentive for companies to take undue risk, because they know they have the government as a safety net. It's not fair to the taxpayers.<p>When we get over this mess, we need to find solutions to prevent this from happening again. Examples such as creating a regulated market for credit default swaps, and limiting the amount of leverage and directional risk a firm can take.",1215781667

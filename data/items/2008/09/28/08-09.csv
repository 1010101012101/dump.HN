Because I know of aids, I should not give a dollar to the local begger?<p>Please stop this bullshit about aids orphans in Africa - it's just propaganda by the charity organisations who want you to give them money. Children are children everywhere in the world. Those aids orphans are not abandoned by Africans - every human being has the nurturing instinct. Neighbours are not letting orphans starve in Africa. Africa does not NEED you to solve this problem - it is a large problem, but it's not a critical problem.<p>There are WORSE things, but they are not sexy. There are men who work their entire life shoveling coal for hardly any money to survive, but nobody cares about them. They are not cute, they are not small, so they are abandoned.<p>Don't let those charity fat cats shape your perception of where help is needed. THINK first! And everyone cannot fight the same battle, we have to diversify and fight different battles. So if you see someone doing nothing, then ask him to do something. If you see people already helping in one way, don't try to make them do what you are already doing, otherwise all these other problems will get ignored.",1222591557

I have not measured how less effective it is than positive feedback.<p>In general, my wife and I try to use positive feedback as much as possible.  But if he knows he is doing something wrong or we remind him something too often, negative feedback is a pretty natural thing to dish out.  He does learn, I am certain of that.",1222591499
317521,comment,317155,317365,0,0,Tichy,,,"Wow, what bullshit. It is not about the number of couples who might be affected. It is about fundamental human rights. Sure, it doesn't matter that much if somebody adds a certificate to their relationship or not - but to make it illegal is more than that, it is a public statement against gay relationships. It is a stepping stone towards hatred, intolerance, discrimination and all sorts of nasty things many people don't want to have in the society they live in. If you start to compromise on the rights of one group of people just because they are a minority, you open the doors for compromising on the rights of all sorts of people, just because they are a minority.<p>AIDS orphans in Africa is a completely unrelated problem, so your throwing it into the discussion is a cheap strawman argumentation. Also, not everybody agrees with Lomborg. Also, are you sure Google is not doing anything for the cause of AIDS orphans? They might have donated money and stuff.<p>Also, how much money has it cost to draw up the proposal for the anti-gay-marriage bill and organize the ballot? Why was that money not spent on AIDS orphans? Why were there enough people annoyed about gay marriage to warrant wasting a lot of public money on that useless debate? That seems much more scandalous to me than somebody wasting a couple of minutes to write a blog entry.",1222591481

Everything else is just a niche player.  Quickbooks will take you all the way to just before 500 employees and going public (Speaking from experience. )  Your financial software should be something you don't even think about.  Quickbooks captures that model -plus, every accountant/bookkeeper in the world knows how to use it.<p>If you are dead set on having a webapp, and are planning on growing, the elements that people are looking for, books that are SOX clean, online expense and Purchase Requests, can be found in products like Netsuite.<p>Our company went the QuickBooks->Netsuite->OracleFinancials route.  And, no matter _how many times_ I go through that routine, OracleFinancials _always_ ends up being a pain to deploy - no matter how much we pay the consultants to make it ""smooth, pain free.""",1222590320

317505,comment,317155,317380,0,0,netcan,,,"I'm not sure that 'marginalising' is the right term but but I agree with the concept. Often, in attempt to be <i>neutral</i> there's a tendency to assign equal weight or validity to all points of view. This is often the case when you have an approximately 50/50 split (eg creationism/evolution in The States). But if you think that an objective truth exists (a <i>right</i> answer) to a fundamental moral/practical/scientific issue, it feels a lot like pandering.<p>A way to try & look at it from a position where <i>you</i> see something as this as an undeniable truth is to imagine a debate in a different time or place. Equal voting rights for women/minorities was once controversial in the US & Europe, How HIV infection occurs is controversial in some places currently. Would you be able to give equal time to all positions in these cases?",1222589031

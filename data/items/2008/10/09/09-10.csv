After rambling about moving to India he presents his ""plan"" to turn around the economy:<p>""Next week, Every venture capital firm in America should take five percent of its available funds and invest that money with best deals they've all had sitting on their desks for months. It doesn't matter what the startups are. Give them the darned money, which I calculate to be about $5 billion spread across a thousand new companies. It isn't tax money, government money, money taken away from education or Medicare. Its just money that was already intended for high-tech investment - money that probably would have been lost anyway. INVEST IT! Stop trying to pretend you are so smart or that your input and board membership really makes a difference (it doesn't - you heard it here first) and write the checks.""<p>Sounds oddly like the reverse of: <a href=""http://www.snopes.com/politics/gasoline/nogas.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snopes.com/politics/gasoline/nogas.asp</a>",1223546058

You would know how to do things other people don't, you'd have a wider network and you'd be more focused.</i><p>What if you just want to chill and watch TV all day?<p>I think the last thing people need is more advice on how to reduce fun in their lives and replace it with work, especially under the guise of ""becoming successful."" If you're 40 years old, have no job and live at home and you're completely happy with that, I would consider you a success.<p>The worst part about society is the fact that it creates arbitrary tiers where you must reach to be ""better"" or ""more successful"" or some other meaningless vapid term. Then it goes further, like this article, and defines ""good"" stuff you should do that will help you be ""successful"" or just ""happier."" I have no plans to follow most of these suggestions for all kinds of reasons... lets see... I hate writing thank-you notes, speaking, volunteering and spending a weekend with people I could be caught up with in an afternoon.<p>Do what makes you happy. Define your own success. Stop taking canned advice about life from people who know nothing about yours. Make your own damn decisions. I work a ton because I love it, not so I can die with more money or feel better than the next guy. Do whatever makes you feel good and the rest will work itself out.<p>Edit: Quick clarification. If this were an article about how to be more fit, rested, intelligent, funded and motivated for the sake of those things, then I would totally endorse it. But if you really wanted to be all those things, you'd be doing that stuff already because it's pretty damn obvious. You wouldn't be wasting those 120 minutes on stuff that wasn't making you happy; you'd replace that stuff with other stuff that made you happy. Pretty straight forward.",1223545465

Maybe it was still a few bucks too expensive and my enthusiasm for the company blinded me to the still dropping state of the market...but I think Google is one of the best companies in the world, and it's currently trading at a fair price.<p>If I believe that Google is going to weather the economic storm better than the average company (I do), and I believe that rapid inflation is going to insure that any money that I keep in cash is going to decline in value (I do), and I believe that Google revenue is going to grow faster than the returns from a CD (I do), and that when the market comes to its senses in a month or two or three it'll realize that GOOG is one of the best companies in the world and worth more than 22 times earnings, particularly given the <i>huge</i> stockpile of cash Google is holding (I do), then I don't feel too bad about missing the bottom by a few percentage points.  And it's only 12 shares (so, $120 on a $4400 holding).  And, like I said, if it keeps going down, I'll try to spot the bottom, or maybe wait until it actually starts a steady climb, and buy a few more shares.<p><i>really i want to understand your point of view</i><p>Do you understand it now?<p>Basically, I just view it as a chance to own shares in a great international company at a dramatic discount off of recent valuations.  It's not a ""bargain"" stock, even now, but that's because it is a stronger company than most of the stocks that were hit as hard.  Yahoo has been hit far harder, but they're obviously not as good a company--though I think they're being maligned unfairly.  They're still a great media company...they just have some problems making money.  But I think Yahoo probably <i>is</i> a great buy right now.",1223544965

327650,comment,326697,327081,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So if I understand you, everybody in the world should spend special time with you or they're morally bankrupt?<p>I think you've twisted your definition of reality a bit. Obviously, even in a world full of wonderful saints everybody can't spend hours with everybody else. The math just doesn't work out. So the act of limiting one's time with someone else cannot be immoral or bad -- in fact, it would seem to be a defining good quality. The reference you quote could only be applied in those cases where you're already spending time with each other: a restaurant, a bellhop, in an elevator, etc.<p>You took a wonderful quote and made it into something it was never meant to be.",1223543984

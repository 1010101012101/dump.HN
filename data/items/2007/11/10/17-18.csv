Most of the interesting links seem to be cross-posted from programming.reddit.com and receive relatively few upvotes.  <p>I know a number of very good hackers and not a single one reads news.ycombinator.com.  Many are too advanced, and too busy hacking, to even bother with sites like this or reddit. You will however find a number of them posting on Lambda the Ultimate, and a few on programming.reddit.com.<p>My gut feeling is that news.ycombinator.com appeals to the low end of the technical hacker continuum, and more to entrepreneurial/business oriented hackers.<p>Here is a list of the top 10 items as I edit this post:<p>1.

78160,comment,77962,78100,0,0,nostrademons,,,"If you're going to consider the possibility that the U.S. economy will go into a full-fledged collapse, you should also consider:<p>1.) The possibility of large tariffs on all international transactions.<p>2.) The possibility that certain nations will be declared ""enemy powers"" and all trade with them will be banned.<p>3.) The possibility that all communications outside the United States (yes, that means the Internet) will be banned for national security reasons.<p>4.) The possibility that the government will nationalize the Internet, your business, or both.<p>5.) The possibility of riots in major U.S. cities.<p>6.) The possibility that a mandatory draft may send you or your workforce to war.<p>7.) The possibility of mass propaganda campaigns and government nationalization of all media.<p>8.) The possibility that all computer professionals will be drafted into massive cryptographic projects.<p>All of these have happened historically after major economic crises.  They almost seem to be inevitable after a Depression-level panic.<p>My point is that some eventualities shouldn't be planned for, not because they won't happen, but because you <i>can't</i> plan for them.  Once political unrest starts, all bets are off, because the basic ground rules of society are gone.  Some looter could come up to you with a gun and blow your brains out, and that would be the end of your business.",1194714658

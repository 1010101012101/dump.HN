It's a rant, duh!<p>That said, as a web designer, I too know the ins and outs of CSS, and how I can get it to do what I need it to. However, the fact that it can be hacked to do anything is not an argument against making it better and more intuitive. You seem to be saying that, since you know how to hack around the bugs, the fact that they're there doesn't really matter! This is not a matter of the fundamental complexity of a language like this, it's a matter of improving a kludgy way of doing things, and therefore lowering the barrier of entry so that my mom, little brother, and girlfriend can learn to code a website without having to know what ""star-HTML"" or ""double-margin-bug"" means, and I'm not really sure why you'd be against that. And yes, I know that it is being improved constantly, it's just painfully slow sometimes.<p>And since I'm in rant mode now, one of the things I hate about CSS is the box model... the ""correct"" one, not the ie6 one. The idea that the ""width"" of an element is not actually it's total width on the page (including border and padding), but the width of the internal content constantly pisses me off. It may be a good idea in theory, but in reality, when you're laying things out, the width of the content area is almost always far less important than the total width, and I hate having to do arithmetic every time I change padding!",1219160630

280417,comment,280324,280404,0,0,ionfish,,,"""Of the three Javascript is the most elegant [...]""<p>Oh, definitely. When I'm doing a personal project I tend to just not bother with niceties like rounded corners for IE users, and as long as the content's still accessible I'm not too bothered. This cuts down on the number of times I need to add junk markup, weird hacks or JavaScript (or, more usually, some combination of the three).<p>At work, we tend to try to do as much as possible with CSS and HTML, since in the end most DOM manipulations done with JS are still changing CSS-accessible properties. The other day we had a client who wanted the bottom border of several columns with different heights aligned. This isn't possible in CSS (although, of course, it was very simple with tables), at least if one is still supporting IE6, as we are, but a few lines of JavaScript sorted it out pretty sharpish.<p>In other words, best practice as far as I'm concerned is to leave JavaScript out of the picture as long as possible, at least where styling or layout enhancements are concerned. This means that users without JavaScript (a very small number, admittedly) will get the best possible experience, and more importantly, it means your JavaScript and your styling are as loosely coupled as possible. That's not too important for a small site, but on a big one where you have to maintain it over a number of years, it becomes absolutely vital (in this way it's no different from any other kind of programming).",1219159741

On the one hand it's a rather silly rant, and is downright wrong in several places. On the other hand, CSS has a number of irritating limitations. However, overall I'd say that the real problem is the dog-slow speed of inclusion of new CSS features by certain browser developers, and the even more glacial up-take of more modern browsers by a large class of users. A lot of the real problems in the article would be solved by people ditching Internet Explorer. As it is, I spend an awful lot of my time writing workarounds for its broken DOM and box model.<p><pre><code>  1. Curvy corners\n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure what the author's obsession with JavaScript fixes is. There are plenty of pure CSS rounded corner implementations. However, they are universally horrible, involving large amounts of junk markup and/or image backgrounds.<p><pre><code>  2. Vertical floats.\n</code></pre>\nWhat do floats have to do with vertical positioning? The problem, however, is real enough. This one is a perfect example of the ""We could do this easily with tables"" class of CSS layout problems.<p><pre><code>  3. Formatting for forms.\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, the author doesn't go far enough. Laying out and styling forms with CSS is a horrible job; at work we have an entire JavaScript package to help out. As far as layout goes, though, a few floated divs tend to deal with most problems. The real problem is when you don't have control over the markup, for example when using the auto-generated forms coming out of a CMS.<p><pre><code>  4. Floats within elements.\n</code></pre>\nNot really sure what he's complaining about here; this is just how floats work. They take elements out of the document flow. There are various ways of clearing internal floats. I tend to use Clearfix, but overflow:auto is good too under certain circumstances (for example, if you're absolutely sure that nothing is going to go beyond the bounds of the container element and thus cover the page in scrollbars).<p><a href=""http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html</a><p><pre><code>  5. Graphical Buttons.\n</code></pre>\nWhat's wrong with the button element? Image replacement works fine for submit buttons, too, as do background images.<p><a href=""http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-element/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://particletree.com/features/rediscovering-the-button-el...</a><p><pre><code>  6. Column support.\n</code></pre>\nThis one is interesting. While I broadly agree with the author, there are some issues. The first is that even if a column specification makes it into CSS3, it still won't work in Internet Explorer 6 or 7. The second is that there are actually multiple, competing column specifications. Unfortunately we're going to be waiting a while for this one. I do, however, wonder if it can really be as easy as the author supposes...<p><a href=""http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css3_multi-column_thriller.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css3_multi-column...</a><p><a href=""http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS3_Columns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/CSS3_Columns</a><p><a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/css/multicolumn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/multicolumn.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-multicol-20070606/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-multicol-20070606/</a><p><pre><code>  7. Order independence.\n</code></pre>\nMixed feelings here. There's support in CSS for a certain amount of order independence, but it requires one to use a lot of floating or absolute positioning. Plus, of course, the point of HTML is to mark up a document. The presentation should mirror or enhance the structure, not change it, and order is surely part of that structure.<p><pre><code>  8. Widths on inline elements.\n</code></pre>\nPretty sure this is what display:inline-block is for.<p><pre><code>  9. Addressing text within textareas (and other elements).\n</code></pre>\nWhat does this have to do with CSS? But yeah, let's hope that some decent forms enhancements makes it into HTML5 in 2021 or whenever. Until then, we have JS frameworks to hack around the massive limitations of the DOM.",1219158223

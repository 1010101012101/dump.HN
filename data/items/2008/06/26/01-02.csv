Most string concatenations probably aren't in-place (using String#+ instead), but there's probably at least a handful of in-place string concats in popular packages like Rails.",1214445255

Create a page on my site and use an iFrame code with the link to that page.\n2. Create a javascript code and use a script with the link to the javascript.<p>Is there really a difference?

No TC, VB, Kotaku, or Joystiq.

Just release it, get some users through SEO and WOM, <i>then</i> pitch it to TC and the crew.  If you never pitch it to them, they'll never know you exist.  Hell, even now, we're not in CrunchBase.

Perhaps you would place it 0.1%? Attempting to reduce the wastage below this point, wherever it lies, will defeat the purposes that drive consumption in the first place: to live and enjoy a good life.<p>It's worth remembering that the reason greenies want to squeeze electricity are environmental rather than financial. Pages and pages of our media are filled with pious discussion of small lifestyle changes. This is wasted effort too!",1214442292

I'd put a tag line or something right on the home page that's basically your 10 second pitch. Something like, ""A better way to communicate and with other gamers."" It'll give people an entry point. I looked at the site for about 45 seconds before finding and clicking on the ""about"" tab. Had I not come from this Hacker news thread, I may likely have just moved on after 44... or 10.<p>I'd also tone down the apologetic tone in the about section.

When you killed Diablo, you got a better series of sounds and more things to click in your inventory.<p>WoW is so successful because it provides such a compelling alternative to reality. In reality, there is risk, there is emotion, there is change. In WoW, you just have a steady stream of clicks, a steady stream of rewards, and a steady group of pseudo-friends (pseudo because they only exist as long as you play WoW and they won't help you move) that don't judge you. In some ways, it is better than reality. If nothing else, it is much easier. The only way to get better is to play more, and the more you play, the more fun you have.",1214442044

Apple is actively highlighting third party apps as a major selling point of the iPhone platform with constant TV commercials showing off some of the best apps. Google's approach to multiple handset vendors already makes the situation confusing to consumers so it's even more important they advertise. A Google commercial showing off 2 or 3 different Android handsets running some third party apps would be a massive boost for the platform and handset makers.<p>Someone pointed out that the Android platform is really starting to feel like ""Linux on the desktop"" where it's always the next handset, the next OS revision, etc that's going to change everything. The same basic rule applies: If you fall too far behind commercial alternatives you will lose no matter how good your platform is.

A substantial investment in effort and materials is required, and perhaps the final product does not attain that achieved by a college education.  But the difference in achievable technical skill probably does not warrant the difference in price between the two options (excepting cases like certain sciences where experience with specific laboratory procedures is highly valuable).<p>The price of college is therefore primarily the price of a credential, and of the ""intangibles.""  As my parent argues, credentials are bubblable; and as the OP argues, the market value of intangibles is (nearly by definition) a product of social factors, and advertising - hence subject to ""bubbles"" (by which I take it we mean wild price fluctuations unrelated to the underlying asset's value).<p>Personally, I think the price of college is really the price of a credential of the intangibles - belonging to a certain class in which there are a set of prioritized attitudes and shared cultural idioms, and a shared experience.  This hypothesis suggests an incentive toward uniformity of experience among educational institutions - which (I opine) can be observed quite widely.",1251759831

Of those 3, 1 is already dead, because of disputes between the founders.   Another hasn't started trying to raise money yet, because there's stuff they want to get built first.  So only 1 of the 16 is currently trying to raise money.",1251759705

A half-compliment is a statement that is earnestly complimentary, but with some negative connotations.<p>Think of it this way: nobody would refer to Roger Federer as ""scrappy"".  You could say that the opposite of ""scrappy"" is dignified, but you could also say the opposite of scrappy is ""elegant.""  Dignity may be deadly, but I'm not sure that's the only thing you lose when you exude ""scrappiness"".",1251759695

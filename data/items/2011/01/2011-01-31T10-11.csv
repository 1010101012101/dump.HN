Australia, Israel, Germany, & others HAVE such agreements with HK which invalidate the rest of what I'm saying. Look up Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance. If you want more free advice, I'd suggest asking the guys at <a href=""http://geoexpat.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geoexpat.com</a> instead, there's lots of HK lawyers there.<p>""Non-exclusive jurisdiction"" clauses are put in because of problems with enforcement of foreign court judgments. If you sue someone in your country and win, but he has no assets in your country, you have to go to <i>his</i> country and convince a court there to enforce your country's judgment if you want to get your hands on any of his money.<p>Contract law differs a lot between countries, but any judge anywhere whom you ask to recognise a foreign court judgment wants to know at least three things: #1: the court which issued the original judgment actually has jurisdiction. #2: there's no more avenues of appeal above that court. #3: you informed the other guy before you sued him. If you can prove any one of those three is untrue, then you derail the enforcement of the foreign judgment. The ""non-exclusive jurisdiction"" clause makes it impossible to argue about #1.<p>Signing a contract for ""non-exclusive jurisdiction"" in HK doesn't restrict you or HKCorp trying to sue each other anywhere in the world you can convince a judge to listen. But it <i>does</i> mean that if HKCorp sues you in HK, wins, and then comes to your country to collect, you can't argue that the HK court was not a proper venue. While if you sue HKCorp in your country, win, and go to HK to try to get the judgment recognised, the HK judge will want to know why you didn't just sue in HK.",1296471325

When did people lose faith in education?</i><p>Seeing people use the single word ""disagree"" as sentence is nearly enough to make anyone lose faith!<p>Seriously, though, the entire article is about education.  It's a common mistake to confuse schooling for education, but the two aren't as correlated as some would like to assume.  I don't say this as a bitter person who never went.  On the contrary, I went twice.  First at a very young age, majoring in mathematics, and then again at the normal age majoring in a foreign language.  Both times I was able to learn some, but neither were as productive as self study had been outside of schooling.<p>I regularly meet people who have spent many years formally studying a foreign language and yet struggle to understand television in that language.  It's also not that uncommon to find skilled programmers, artists or writers who have not studied their field at a university.<p>Another common argument for schooling is that it makes well rounded people who have a basic competence in all the most fundamental fields.  Sadly, this isn't true either.  Most college grads are still pretty shaky on high school math.  The same is true for writing.<p>I'm not saying that schooling is useless.  It <i>can</i> be an excellent tool for education, particularly in some fields.  However, it isn't the <i>only</i> way of education.",1296471194

I've begun to think about a new concept for harvesting this type of talent. What about the following idea:<p>As a company (or recruiting company) you essentially ""poach"" people who have gotten into Booth, Wharton, Kellogg, etc. So you approach them once they have received letters of acceptance from these schools and offer them a nice job in your company. The individuals that actually would accept your offer (and of course the offer would be good) would even be in the ideal talent pool of aforementioned top MBA universities. Down the line someone may question ""well yes Mr. Smith did get into Wharton, but he never went"". My answer would be ""Any person smart enough and business minded enough would realize their investment in this offer is much more advantageous to their career than attaining their MBA"".<p>Who wants to create a recruiting business that does this? ;)",1296470920

Resolution is nice, but I'm one of those people who constantly notices flicker at 24 fps.<p>It shouldn't be difficult to convert a movie shot on this film to digital, so here's what I'd do:  Let Chris Nolan (or whoever's interested) shoot a movie on it, then convert it to digital.  Next, do some A/B testing.  Select a smallish number of theatres in major markets who would be showing his film on multiple screens and install the needed projectors in one of them. Advertise the choice in those theatres only, and see what happens. If the director likes it, they'll probably talk about it in the press, so that's free advertising right there. If the experience really is that much better, you should see higher viewership for the MaxiVision screenings.  After that, it's an easy sell to the studio execs.  In all, they spend a trivial amount of money to do some A/B testing and get usable results.<p>Granted, the studios are conservative and often myopic or flat-out wrong (3d), but even they shouldn't have too much trouble seeing whether it's a good (cheap) investment or not.",1296470895

Skype says it is ""by design""",https://jira.skype.com/browse/SCM-721,"Thought I would pass on a word of warning about the recently released Skype 5 for Mac. Once installed, if Skype 5 is running (even in background), it will block Flash from being able to access your webcam. This breaks quite a few popular web applications. Unfortunately users will think the problem is caused by Flash, when it is actually caused by Skype.<p>Examples of sites and applications broken by Skype 5.<p>http://www.dailybooth.com - core feature of the site
http://www.facebook.com - webcam record and ""take a photo"" feature
http://www.picnik.com - image editors that have import from webcam
http://www.webcamsnapper.com - webcam photo widget used by brizzly, dailybooth, many other sites. (disclosure: my company built this app)
adobe connect, dimdim, etc - online meeting apps<p>Skype has been aware of this issue since the release of the beta in November and yet they have not fixed it before the general release. According to their issue tracker they say this new behavior is ""by design"".<p>https://jira.skype.com/browse/SCM-721<p>In the old Skype (2.8) this was not a problem, so something has changed. If indeed this is not a bug and is ""by design"" then it is a very worrying move. Imagine for a moment things were reversed. Say for instance a new release of Flash stopped all video calls working in iChat or Skype. People would be outraged, Gruber would have a heart attack.<p>Just to be 100% clear, Skype doesn't need to be in a video call for it to block webcam access by Flash. It simply needs to be running. The only fix is to shut down Skype then reload your browser. After this the webcam will start working again in Flash. The only long term fix is to uninstall Skype 5 and install an older version.<p>More discussion of the issue in Skype forum: http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=782411",1296469777

You and I also both know why I haven't delved into whatever specific points you think need delving-into.<p>You introduced your name into the discussion, presumably because you're confident enough to sign your name to your opinions and arguments, which is admirable. It is thus not a valid argument to suggest that acknowledging your (public) name is a malicious act. But the obvious invalidity of the argument clearly didn't stop 'lawnchair_larry from making it!<p>If it helps you any, you can peruse the rest of my comments on HN. Whenever it's reasonable, I try not to use nicks and handles; I call 'patio11 ""Patrick"", I call Paul Graham ""Graham"" (I don't know him in person), &c.<p>Have you noticed how, despite you repeatedly insinuating that I'm knowingly making false statements about you, I'm not huffing and puffing about it? That's because the huffing and puffing is dreadfully boring and teaches us nothing about anything whatsoever.

However data sets taken from land do not show a clear warming trend.  So, of course, that is what this particular researcher uses.<p>The discrepancy between global absorption of heat and global temperature becomes very understandable when you note that a lot of that absorption of heat takes the form of melting ice.  And when you melt ice you both absorb a lot of heat energy, and flood the environment around you with cold water that cools it off.<p>(It is worth noting that this particular absorption pattern cannot continue forever.

5796407,comment,5795954,5795954,10,0,rlu,,,"So, really, a few thoughts:<p>1. I think a theme that comes up on HN often is ""when do you ship?"". You could <i>always</i> argue that ""well, we should wait to ship in order to [fix this/add this feature/...]"". At a certain point, you have to say that you're done and ship it. There will always be room for improvement and the good news is that you're actually able to improve it later on. You just need to set a ""ship"" bar that is acceptable.<p>2. Like others have said, the first point is made even more important as Microsoft was already late to market with a tablet friendly OS.<p>3. People could argue all day about whether it was acceptable or not for the Office team to have released Office 2013 without Metro style apps. Whether it was acceptable for Windows 8 to be released before the Office team made Metro style apps. After taking points 1 & 2 into consideration, you have to remember that you need to manage resources. I'm sure the Office team WANTED Metro apps, but it was probably impossible for them to ship Office 2013 and Metro Office at the same time and ""on time"" for Office 2013 desktop release. Like I said, you could argue all day whether you think they managed their time/resources properly but either way there is something to be learned from this. You simply can't do everything at once. I don't know what the reasons are here, but for some reason Microsoft must have deemed it more important to ship desktop Office before the Metro apps. I'd also bargain that the Metro apps will have something to do with Office 365 subscriptions and IIRC the desktop Office 2013 release is largely testing Office 365 out (the consumer version, anyways). Anyways: point here is you can't do everything at once.<p>4. The article talks about perception as if it was a permanent thing. I'd say that perception can change without having it to be some colossal task. I have to go soon and the first example that comes to mind is people made so, so, so much fun of the iPad when it first came out. I remember people making fun of the first person I know to have bought one. And now? ""Everyone"" has one. I don't think Apple necesarily did anything to make this perception change, but after people saw the benefits of it they changed their attitudes towards it themselves. The same thing can happen here (e.g. if I didn't like Windows 8 but then I see someone using Windows 8.x in some way I think is really cool, it might cross my mind that maybe now Windows is in a better state and my perception of the product will change).<p>My $0.02<p>disclosure: i interned at microsoft in 2011 and 2012",1369964797

I'm a part of the unexotic underclass; I was doing pretty good in my life till serious health problems started in college. Being transgender played a large role too. I've been homeless, broke, been a housemaid and a sex worker, exchanged sex for housing. Before that I was top of my International Baccalaureate program class, and a National Merit scholar. I attended a well ranked state school.  I just didn't have any golden parachutes when I had health problems.<p>From being poor though what I've ended up discovering is just how hard it is to come up from being homeless and broke, or not being from money and having serious health problems, or being black and getting a felony record from an asshole cop. There are a lot of decent poor people, that just can't come up in the world anymore. Their jobs work them like dogs, the world treats them like shit, and their spare energy left at the end of the day is zip. There's nothing left to better yourself with because everyone takes and takes from you and gives back nothing but disrespect.<p>Sure there are people that are just lazy too. But even among those people there's only a small number that are purposely taking advantage. The silent majority have either disabilities holding them back, or trauma from their life (PTSD). Or the simple lack of anyone parenting them properly and encouraging them to explore their dreams and interests.<p>Drugs, alcohol, junk food, tv and other vices are a coping mechanism for a shitty life. Make people's lives the least bit better in substantial ways, and those people will start to flower and bloom into more capable and wonderful people.<p>The disrespect, patronizing, and superior attitudes of the privileged upper class are a huge part of the problem.",1369964250

And then by the time the gas tax is $1 higher than it is now, the installed base of cars has been replaced with higher efficiency ones, so the burden of the tax is already mitigated because a) you're now buying less gas, and b) so is everyone else, so demand goes down, so the pre-tax price of gas goes down and cancels out a significant portion of the tax.<p>Meanwhile the government collects a large pile of cash (largely at the expense of oil company profits -- what a shame) that can be used to subsidize the installation of renewable energy generating capacity, which creates jobs etc. etc.",1369962111

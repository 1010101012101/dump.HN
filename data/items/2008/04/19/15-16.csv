Lawyers don't make money filing papers; they make money suing people who screwed up the paperwork.",1208620550

Maybe lumber and concrete just fall out of the sky for him, and people work for him free because he's such a nice guy who'll help you with his stereo.<p>But Yanik is selling his time, he's getting $300k for the time it takes him to manage a building's construction. Stein says he's ""well on his way to being in the top 1 percent and, after that, the top one-tenth of 1 percent."" Absolutely false.<p>Let's say Yanik can put up not one but <i>three</i> $300k buildings a year, because he's so talented. Great, he'll be a billionaire in just 1,111 years.<p>The wealthiest 1% of America isn't just a little ahead of the rest of us; as Stein correctly notes they're hugely ahead. It doesn't happen by trying harder at your job but by redefining the work, putting capital to work for you instead of going to work yourself.",1208619905

Luckily I identified a good partner right around that time--a sales guy to match my tech skills. I doubt the company would have gotten off the ground had I continued alone.",1208619886

Thus, if you want to lose weight, you might also try changing other aspects of your life at the same time (e.g., moving to a new city or starting a new job).",1208618115

Put your map marker on Kresge Auditorium at Stanford if you want to talk about Startup School.<p>I want to stress that this is an early, limited-time alpha version.  It is not feature-complete, and it may fall flat on its face, but we couldn't miss this opportunity to get feedback from hundreds of smart people.  We'll close down after this weekend and hopefully have a much better beta to launch in a couple of months.<p>Thanks for your help.",1208617632

Hungerford is very detailed with lots of proofs and examples.  Jacobson's Basic Algebra I & II is also very good but very sparse. I learned more from Jacobson but Hungerford is a great reference.",1208617337

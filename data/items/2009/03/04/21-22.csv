503463,comment,503326,503326,0,0,time_management,,,"Making homework optional across the board (e.g. you can get an A if you ace the exams) is silly. It makes sense for a few courses (e.g. freshman writing, calculus sequence, intro language) which exist to train a specific mastery that can be objectively tested in a short period of time. It doesn't make sense, though, to pass a CS major based on exams alone (as opposed to programs), an English major without papers, or a math major without take-home proof assignments. He could argue that such assignments <i>are</i> tests, but then the distinction between tests and homework becomes so blurry as to be useless.<p><i>Making the tenth of a percent from 89.4 to 89.5 worth immensely more than the 9.4 percent from 80 to 89.4 is idiotic.</i><p>I'd argue that the problem is inherent in the fact that different grading scales (0-100 vs. A-F) are appropriate for numerically-graded exams and subjective assignments like papers. Converting a 0-100 scale to A/B/C/D/F has the problem the OP mentioned. But when it comes to papers, most people can only judge 4-5 levels of quality before inconsistencies pop up. This is one reason why the ""E"" (high fail) level of the original A-F grading system almost immediately dropped away, and D is rarely used. A/B/C/(D)/F exist, in effect, to mirror those separable levels of quality.<p>In fact, I'd argue that innate this 4-level limitation is one of the reasons many colleges (esp. Ivies) have such grade inflation in qualitative courses: with plus/minus grades, the three discernible levels of respectable work are mapped to A, A-, and B+/B, the one of mediocrity to B-/C+/C, depending on the professor's proclivities, and the truly awful work to C-/D/F... whereas a solid B (85%) in an intro science or language course is still a respectable grade.",1236203156

I am able to select multiple songs, but dragging them to the queue area does not work-only 1 song is added.  Since I can't click on the icons, I am not able to quickly add multiple songs to my queue.

I know a number of teachers I had used that philosophy, despite the clamoring of the kids at the top of the class.<p>Now that I'm not there anymore, I actually agree with them. Classes don't exist simply to teach course material - there is a lot of stuff you learn simply by doing all the work. Consider a lit course. The stated goal of the course might be reading and analysis of the course texts, but you also get better at writing simply because you did the ""busywork"".<p>The same holds for quantitative classes. There's only so much you can test in an hour, even if there are tests every week. Longer problem sets cater to a different skill set that tests, and they are both worth learning.

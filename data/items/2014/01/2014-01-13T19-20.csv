7052886,comment,7051611,7052565,1,0,lmkg,,,"A &#x27;true&#x27; curried function in clojure doesn&#x27;t need <i>partial</i> because it overloads on the arity of the function. It automatically partializes itself if it&#x27;s called with too few arguments.<p>E.g. you have a function <i>f</i> that takes two arguments, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. If the function is truly curried, then (f x y) is a full function call of f that returns a value, while (f x) returns a function of one argument, as if you had used <i>partial</i>. You could create a (two-argument) currying helper-function with the following:<p><pre><code>  (defn curry-2 [f]\n        (fn ([x] (partial f x))\n            ([x y] (f x y))))\n</code></pre>\nBasically with a currying function, (f x y) and ((f x) y) are equivalent calls, without the need for <i>partial</i>.<p>The reason this isn&#x27;t more pervasive is because it doesn&#x27;t play well with optional parameters, &rest parameters, arity overloading, or other ways in which the number of arguments to a function might vary (Haskell permits currying by not allowing variable param lists). Clojure has a couple of library functions that use this pattern (notably, the <i>reducer</i> library), but it&#x27;s not ubiquitous.",1389642989

Certainly too expensive to be used in coffee. However, by the early 18th century, the New World colonies of the West Indies, both British and French, were producing sugar relatively cheaply. At one point, sugar was a <i>huge</i> European commodity and the demand for it actually drove quite a bit of the slave trade to provide the labor that made it possible. Similarly, coffee had previously been available, but had not spread all over Europe.\nHowever, the British and Dutch East India companies were able to acquire larger quantities of coffee cheaper (likely through slavery, at least in Indonesia) than the product available through the old overland &quot;Spice Route&quot; from Arabia through Egypt to Venice. ransportation and handling costs would have been exhorbitant!

It isn&#x27;t always perfect, but it is usually good and it was ringing pretty loudly, which is why I stopped beating around the bush. I am not the only person here, looking at the other comments, that strongly suspected you of trolling here. If you are not, then you have my complete apologies.<p>Now as to why I think that this club is ok, is not because I think that skin colour has any relevance in learning to code. Also, if I thought they were being exclusively for black girls, rather than just targetting them, then I would not give this any time, but that seems to be evidently not the case.<p>The sad fact is that skin colour has deep relevance in the US because it is still such a deeply divided and institutionally racist country in many ways, especially if you do not have enough money to sugar the pill.<p>If you are a teenage black girl in poverty in the US you are bombarded with media telling you what defines a teenage black girl in poverty in the US. You are marketed to as a teenage black girl in poverty, you are educated as a teenage black girl in poverty.<p>And unless you are unusually idiosyncratic, you will already have bought the story you are being sold by the time you are a teenager.<p>Most people buy the story they are sold by the society around them.<p>As far as I am concerned, given the society and history of the US, the club BlackGirlsCode is not spreading the message, &quot;coding is a black thing&quot;, it is spreading the message &quot;black girls are able and allowed to code&quot;, which is a positive thing. It isn&#x27;t forcing people to think of themselves in a certain way, it is trying to start with how the people they are trying to help are already viewing themselves, it is accepting that the society is really screwed right now and so sod trying to destroy tribalism in one fell swoop, as that is a big job and may take a few more generations, lets try and get people to widen their horizons and do something about the massive technological literacy gap. Clubs called BlackGirlsCode in the US are needed for exactly the same reason that organisations dedicated to literacy for Dalit women in India are neccessary.<p>Personally I would rather that society drop the whole black/white thing altogether as a description of skin colour, as not only is the binary designation one of the most heinous divide and conquer traps that is going, but I think that the terms are also woefully inaccurate and unfit for purpose as descriptive adjectives. However I rarely get a good response to that, so convincing society in general of that one is really more of a long game.",1389642726

This is taken from daily experience: I work on a code base that is about 25K lines of Haskell and 35K lines of Javascript. Refactoring the Haskell is a pleasure.

You can do service discovery by &quot;announcing&quot; each container to the cluster. With an etcd watch, any process on the cluster could be listening for changes to your service discovery keyspace, and take any action you specify (Reconfigure proxies, etc.)<p>Etcd also provides distributed locking for the cluster through a module. If you need to prevent an action from happening more than once, you can take a lock on a specific key to prevent others from processing that item.<p>Related to locking is the leader election module which offers an easy way to choose a new leader for a distributed service.

So, if you&#x27;re on an ISP peered directly with CloudFront and make a request using your ISPs DNS servers, CloudFront&#x27;s DNS might give you back the IP to a server directly on that peering circuit. These kinds of relationships and new servers are added/removed all the time, so the IPs change regularly. A hard-coded IP in an A record won&#x27;t work because of this.

They can think continuously and dynamically. They can change their instructions at a whim. They can provide custom solutions immediately. And they aren&#x27;t limited to one way to solve a problem.<p>When you have to perform a bunch of complicated changes in bulk, you might think automating it would be the best way to ensure a uniform delivery of your changes. But when a single thing is different about one environment, everything is fucked. The only way to ensure a bunch of sensitive changes go off without a hitch is to make it a manual process, even if you have to supplement it with some automated processes along the way.<p>In this case, Dropbox allowed their site&#x27;s reliability to be dictated by the automated maintenance of production servers. It&#x27;s always dangerous to make changes on a production server. But what makes it worse here is that they relied on a script to make sure everything happened perfectly, and didn&#x27;t double-check the results before putting it back into production.<p>They didn&#x27;t even back up the old data in case they needed to quickly revert, which should be a basic requirement of any production change!

There&#x27;s myriads of different actions to achieve the same result.<p>Imagine this scenario: China postures for military action, the U.S does not intent to interfere. Rather than &quot;abandon it&#x27;s ally&quot; the U.S puts on a show of strength, joint military exercises, recommitting to the defense of Taiwan, the whole 9 yards. Quietly however, the U.S. withdraws support for secessionist factions within Taiwan, shifting the fragile equilibrium. pro-china factions gain power quickly, the weakening direct U.S support combined with China&#x27;s military posturing drives moderates and anti-war secessionists towards the pro-china faction. With the balance of power now in their favor, mainland + the pro-china factions ramp up propaganda efforts, strengthening ties, eventually setting the stage for reunification. The U.S of course, while &quot;extremely disappointed&quot;, won&#x27;t oppose the popular will of the Taiwanese people.<p>And that&#x27;s how the U.S abandons its ally without abandoning its ally, and China takes Taiwan by force without ever firing a single shot.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s just one possible scenario out of thousands.

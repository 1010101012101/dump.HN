9848062,comment,9847665,9848023,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"Fair point. However, how do we know if that&#x27;s better or not? Perhaps it&#x27;s better for those who remain rational during a crisis to accumulate more wealth by enabling them to place bets opposite the stampede. When the next crisis happens, they&#x27;ll own a greater percentage of the market, and will act to correct irrational behavior. By placing limitations on short selling, we are helping the irrational people at the expense of rational insightful people.<p>I dislike the idea of these market closures or limitations on short selling because it essentially implies that people can&#x27;t be responsible for themselves and their own decisions. People have agency and can decide what&#x27;s best for them. If that&#x27;s following a herd or opposing the herd, so be it. Perhaps the world would be better off if our systems were designed to more fully embrace meritocracy, moral hazard, and responsibility for one&#x27;s self.<p>My experience tells me that giving people more responsibility tends to help them grow: they make their own decisions and learn from them. Taking away that responsibility minimizes risk in the short term, but also minimizes growth and upside in the long term. Maybe this is true at a larger scale in our markets as well. Obviously it&#x27;s hard to know for sure one way or another.",1436302754

The problem has accumulated over generations and we should be taking an approach that is designed to work out over a similar timescale, like the restructuring of German war debt in 1953 (in contrast to the self-defeating hard-line approach on WW1 reparations following the Treaty of Versailles).<p><i>only sane option seems an orderly default + Grexit. Sure, you&#x27;ll likely have 6 months of crisis and a loss of confidence in the EU, but it&#x27;s not going to be the end of the World...</i><p>I honestly think it would be the end of the European project within 1-2 decades. I am no Eurosceptic - on the contrary I&#x27;ve always felt very proud to be an EU citizen and been a supporter of full-on political political union and a fully federal Europe. If you&#x27;ll forgive me quoting myself from another thread, I think a Grexit is like trying to deal with the pain of a hangover by amputating one&#x27;s own head. Greece is the cradle of western civilization - philosophically, linguistically an in many other respects.<p>The political payload of a Grexit would be a tacit admission that capitalist/mercantilist  considerations trump those of citizenship or political identity. I agree completely that we can&#x27;t solve the problem by just writing off debt, as we&#x27;d be back in the same place in a few years. But nor can we solve it by opting for Grexit + drachma + devaluation, ie throwing up our hands at the fiscal problem and switching to monetarist tricks instead.<p>The EU has to stand for something deeper than a set of accounting principles, or it can&#x27;t stand at all.",1436302707

9848044,comment,9838458,9843739,0,0,archagon,,,"When I was younger, I was really worried about learning how to imagine, specifically in regards to music. So many musicians seemed to have started out at ridiculously young ages, and despite the fact that I had been plunking away at piano lessons for many years, I still couldn&#x27;t hear any original music in my head. Then, when I got to college, I decided to do a side-major in music, just for fun. As I was doing my listening exercises (hours of analytical listening) and diving into the depths of music theory, I started noticing something in my head opening up. I could hear snippets of music... recombined from others I had heard recently, perhaps, but with definite original streaks to them. I was not actively playing an instrument at the time. I was not even composing. All I was doing was building a solid musical foundation. And just like that, after a couple of &quot;aha!&quot; moments, music was no longer a formless mist. It had structure. It had rules (that you could elect to break). Now that I could see the walls of my room, I could finally start to build on my own.<p>Anyway, my hunch (and reading between the lines of the article) is that something similar happens with art. Once you learn to intuitively visualize shapes in three dimensions, and once you develop a large mental &quot;reference library&quot; of architecture/landscape/characters/etc., you&#x27;ll be able to create imaginitive new worlds without much effort. But without having that foundation, you&#x27;re still stumbling around in the dark.",1436302556

Unlike OpenVZ, LXC does not need a custom kernel, and is supported in the mainline Linux kernel paving the way for widespread adoption.<p>Docker took the LXC OS container template as a base, modified the container OS init to run a single app, builds the OS file system with layers of aufs, overlayfs, and disables storage persistence. And this is the app container.<p>This is an opinionated use case of containers that adds significant complexity, more a way to deploy app instances in a PAAS centric scenario.<p>A lot of confusion around containers is because of the absence of informed discussion on the merits or demerits of this approach and the understanding that you have easy to use OS containers like LXC that are perfectly usable by end users like VMs are, and then app containers that are doing a few more things on top of this.<p>You don&#x27;t need to adopt Docker to get the benefits of containers, you adopt Docker to get the benefits of docker and often this distinction is not made.<p>A lot of users whose first introduction to containers is Docker tend to conflate Docker to containers, and thanks to some &#x27;inaccurate&#x27; messaging from the Docker ecosystem think LXC is &#x27;low level&#x27; or &#x27;difficult&#x27; to use, Why would anyone try LXC if they think it&#x27;s low level or difficult to use?

Isn&#x27;t that preventing the market from properly adjusting to whatever circumstances have occurred, or new information that has arrived? Limitations like this feel like &quot;Let&#x27;s all pretend that the truth isn&#x27;t true&quot;.<p>It astonishes me that in this day and age there are still so many arbitrary controls on marketplaces, such as the Greek stock markets shutting down due to their financial crisis. Isn&#x27;t it important for the market to adjust and properly accommodate those events? (If the market simply cannot function due to the crisis itself, then that makes sense. I assumed it was shut down because people are afraid of how prices will change as a result.) Sure, some people might panic in an unreasonable way, and if they do, they will get taken to town by other people who go long during the same time period. Just like people who are overly confident will be taken to town by short sellers if there&#x27;s a bubble and it bursts.<p>I understand why there are controls on the marketplace like around prohibiting naked short selling, or reversing transactions that were obviously erroneous, but controls like preventing short selling seem absurd. If someone wants to bet that prices will decrease, let them! That&#x27;s an important signal and an important correction to the market. Perhaps we would have fewer market bubbles if there was more continuous correction.<p>Is anyone working on a bitcoin-based stock market with no limitations on trading? Could such a thing be legal? Perhaps actual shares of stock are not being traded, but rather some other kind of financial instrument that represents the right to the upside or downside of some shares without having to own them, but you own the upside or downside. Then the idea would be that anyone can buy these instruments using currency or bitcoin on a market that operates differently than today&#x27;s conservative markets.<p>I imagine this is probably illegal for a variety of reasons, such as &quot;know your customer&quot;, but it&#x27;s interesting to think about. How would the stock market be different if trades were unregulated, in the sense that there are no limitations on buying and selling shares. It operates 24/7 and never shuts down no matter what happens, and never imposes constraints on selling or short selling. I imagine this market would need to operate as a central authority or federation of trusted brokers (someone needs to verify that the seller actually owns the shares they&#x27;ve promised to deliver), but the authority or brokers would be willing to transact in both regular currency and bitcoin.

To say people aren&#x27;t accountable at all for government borrowing is silly; ultimately it&#x27;s the electorate&#x27;s responsibility to ask candidates and political parties how they intend to pay for their programs. Of course, it&#x27;s very hard for voters to understand a whole economy and assess whether a party&#x27;s proposals are good or bad, or to assess whether a party or politician is likely to be able to deliver on intentions, no matter how sensible, or to fall back on other measures. I&#x27;m pretty sure that when Syriza was elected their collective hope was not just to be in conflict with other EU countries but to get the Greek economy growing again so as to increase revenue and reduce the ratio of debt:productivity, but of course what you hope to achieve and what you can actually get done are often two different things.<p>I also think the referendum vote was the correct one because other countries, politicians, and populations in Europe have been deluding themselves about this situation to almost as great a degree as the Greeks were, and it&#x27;s plain that the existing strategy has just resulted in the  Greek economy shrinking more and more and the external debt becoming impossible to pay.<p>But this notion that the population of a democratic country is in no wise accountable for the actions of its government is just facile.

There are some disciplines such as machine learning and quantitative finance which are all but predicated upon Python, with excellent results. Comparisons to Go and JS are incongruous; those languages have other benefits which would make them good choices if things like concurrency (Go) and very high level abstractions (JS) are important.<p>The Python 3 transition was indeed rough, but in no way is it a &quot;debacle&quot;.

And the degree of capability looks to be strongly related to the complexity of a living being&#x27;s brain (or what passes for it - microbes cogitate, in a very dim but adequate-to-their-needs way by discharging and detecting chemicals in their protoplasm).

9847874,comment,9844923,9844923,0,0,nkurz,,,"This is a great law review article by a judge currently on the US 9th Circuit.  His thesis is well expressed by the opening paragraph:<p><pre><code>  Although we pretend otherwise, much of what we do in the law 
  is guesswork. For example, we like to boast that our 
  criminal justice system is heavily tilted in favor of 
  criminal defendants because we’d rather that ten guilty men 
  go free than an innocent man be convicted. There is reason 
  to doubt it, because very few criminal defendants actually 
  go free after trial. Does this mean that many guilty men are 
  never charged because the prosecution is daunted by its 
  heavy burden of proof? Or is it because jurors almost always 
  start with a strong presumption that someone wouldn’t be 
  charged with a crime unless the police and the prosecutor 
  were firmly convinced of his guilt? We tell ourselves and 
  the public that it’s the former and not the latter, but we 
  have no way of knowing. They say that any prosecutor worth 
  his salt can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. It 
  may be that a decent prosecutor could get a petit jury to 
  convict a eunuch of rape.
</code></pre>
He goes on to detail many of the specific issues, and even better to offer detailed suggestions on how significant improvements could be made.  Many of those that have to do with juries are seemingly obvious:<p><pre><code>  1. Give jurors a written copy of the jury instructions. 

  2. Allow jurors to take notes during trial and provide
     them with a full trial transcript.

  3. Allow jurors to discuss the case while the trial is ongoing.

  4. Allow jurors to ask questions during the trial.

  5. Tell jurors up-front what’s at stake in the case.

  6. Give jurors a say in sentencing.
</code></pre>
In my limited experience, I think providing the jurors with a full transcript of the trail might make the most positive influence.<p>In the current system (at least where I am in California) we are allowed to take personal notes, but there is no reasonable way to match the notes of the individual jurors to the testimony that actually took place.  A court stenographer makes a transcript of the trial while it goes on, but this transcript is considered to be their personal copyrighted property.   If the jury wants to hear a portion of the testimony again (perhaps because the jury members disagree as to what was said), a written request must be made to the judge that describes the portion of testimony that the jury desires.<p>The following day (or whatever day the original court stenographer is available, which may be longer) the stenographer appears in front of the jury to read aloud from their transcript the portion that the judge feels is appropriate.   The reading is done a single time from point A to point B without intonation and about as fast as the stenographer can speak.  If they can keep up, the jury can take notes on this, but no typed copy is made available, ostensibly because this would violate the stenographer&#x27;s copyright.  Requests for portions to be read more than once are met with eye-rolling, initial partial compliance, and then eventual refusal due to scheduling constraints.<p>Can anyone believe this is the system which best enables a jury to reach the truth of the matter?  Consciously or not, it&#x27;s designed to have jurors decide based on their gut instincts instead of on the fine details of the case.",1436300971

If two minors within a certain age range have sex, they may theoretically be &quot;raping each other&quot;, but considering that an actual criminal offense in itself is absurd.<p>Now, an adult having sex with a child on the other hand is <i>obviously</i> acting criminally. It&#x27;s the adult&#x27;s responsibility to act in the child&#x27;s best interests due to the child&#x27;s lack of ability to give consent -- even if the child (for whatever reason) engages it, it&#x27;s against their best interests to follow through.<p>As for sexually active &quot;minors&quot; and very young adults, especially at very narrow age ranges, that&#x27;s not as trivial to answer. A hard cut-off seems the most straightforward answer but creates absurd outcomes in edge cases (e.g. someone who just turned 18 having sex with someone about to turn 18 in a country where 18 is the age of consent would be considered a rapist but not if both of them were just a tiny bit younger or older). I guess it&#x27;s best to have case law deal with these situations individually.<p>Maybe I should clarify that the reason I used the word &quot;kids&quot; was to make it clear we&#x27;re not specifically talking about &quot;children&quot; in the intuitive sense. The danger that six year olds will randomly decide to have sex with each other is relatively low (if we ignore &quot;sex play&quot;, which is a different can of worms). That&#x27;s not what the article is about. We&#x27;re specifically talking about &quot;kids&quot; (i.e. minors, which depending on where you live can include anyone between 12 and 21) who are fairly likely to be already sexually active without any external motivation/dissuasion.",1436300886

9847850,comment,9847623,9847707,0,0,Lazare,,,"> once the fraud that was perpetrated on Brussels became clear, why weren&#x27;t they kicked out immediately?<p>It was clear from before the Euro ever started.  Everyone (by which I mean, the elites, analysts, the press, politicians, et al) knew that countries like Greece and Portugal had no business joining the Euro, and were lying through their teeth to get in.  Then again, everyone knew that the entire project was founded on lies, cooked books, and ignored rules, sacrificed towards the overriding goal of ever closer union.<p>After letting Greece in with a wink and a nod, why in the world would they have then kicked them out?  The fraud, if you want to call it that, was on the voters and taxpayers, not on the people running the EU.  And if they kicked them out, how could they justify not kicking out all the other countries who had engaged in blatant trickery, which would be, well, all of them?<p>France engaged in some elaborate budget trickery to get their deficit under the line (swapping future pension obligations for one off payments to make their deficit look low enough)[1], Germany waffled a bit but the moves were accepted.  How could they not be?  France at least lied to make their deficit pass muster; Germany was in blatant violation from the start (which was meant to preclude their entry, or at least trigger massive fines.  Naturally it did neither.)<p>Or in short:  It&#x27;s the old glass houses rule.  France, Germany, Italy, etc, were in <i>NO</i> place to demand a strict adherence to the rules in the case of Greece, since by a strict reading of the rules they shouldn&#x27;t have been in the Euro zone either.  The Euro project was inherently political from the start, and <i>politically</i> it needed as many countries to join as possible.  Even if that was economic disaster.<p>Edit:  A better link[2] about how by the terms of the governing treaties, most Eurozone members did not qualify for entry, including (hilariously) Germany which had too much debt.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/20/news/20iht-euro.t.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/20/news/20iht-euro.t.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/politics-maastricht-convergence-criteria"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voxeu.org/article/politics-maastricht-convergence...</a>",1436300724

The last set of Syriza proposals included things like a one-off tax of 12% on business incomes over €500,000 (not unreasonable in either amount or in the context of a culture of corrupt tax evasion), as well as a small rise in corporate tax from 26 to 29%. Creditors rejected these proposals as being &#x27;anti growth&#x27;. Now I don&#x27;t think one can ta one&#x27;s way to prosperity, but the last 5 years of austerity in Greece strongly suggest that you can&#x27;t cut your way there either, and it&#x27;s facile to pretend that taxes should only be considered for their pure macroeconomic effects considering the lamentable history of tax evasion in Greece (which has deep cultural roots in centuries under the Ottoman Empire.<p>Greece still has to undertake massive reforms, and Syriza&#x27;s governance has been marked by brinksmanship and overheated rhetoric - but that&#x27;s what happens when you put people&#x27;s backs against the wall. It&#x27;s a generational-scale problem that calls for a long-term rather than the nonsensical series of bandaids that have been thrown at it. I certainly felt that some austerity and fiscal adjustment was warranted, and indeed applying that approach has allowed countries like Ireland to to re-balance the books and regain access to capital markets. But this approach has plainly ceased to work in the case of Greece.<p>More detail on the specifics of said proposals here:

9847802,comment,9845122,9847587,0,0,tedks,,,"In what sense is it a far cry from the Red Scare? Which Red Scare, for starters? There have been two purges of leftists from American civil society in the 20th century, and both of them attempted (from the look of the outcomes) to marginalize leftist politics as far away from the mainstream as possible, to wreck the lives of anyone involved in leftist politics, and to discourage people from those politics due to the fear of the Inquisition turning its eye on them.<p>Of these goals, the first is no longer relevant (the media keeps leftists and similar out of politics far more effectively than periodically purging the State Department of leftist party members ever did). The second is very real and continues to be accomplished by various police agencies. Because of modern &quot;terrorism&quot; laws, various methods of protest are criminalized as terrorism (mostly pertaining to protests that disrupt businesses, like picket lines or sit-ins), and so protest groups can find themselves targeted by fusion centers, special anti-protest task forces, and federal policing agencies (like the DHS).<p>Finally, the last goal continues to be enshrined today. Free speech zones and militarized police presence at protests makes protesting a much less empowering act than it was in the 60s and 70s -- imagine if Norman Morrison had burned himself in a free speech pen miles from the Pentagon! Going to a protest now entails locking oneself in a cage and being stared down by beefy, roided-up cops that are actively trying to attack protesters and see protesters as an enemy force. Use of grand jury investigations, fusion centers, task forces, entrapment, and finally, the persistence of social media, makes it hard to join nonviolent groups without the fear of &quot;something&quot; coming up that could ruin you for life. The programming in American educational systems about &quot;keeping Facebook friendly for colleges and employers&quot; supports this self-censorship.<p>If you look into what is actually going on, possibly by researching some of the topics I mentioned in my last comment, you&#x27;ll find that modern suppression of non-mainstream politics is indeed comparable to the red scare. The fact that it no longer occurs to such fanfare indicates that such behavior has been <i>normalized</i> on the part of the state.",1436300195

They should alert you no matter and I am surprised they didn&#x27;t.<p>As for mandrill what is your deliverability rate and reputation?  We generally maintain just shy of 98% deliverability and an &quot;excellent&quot; reputation on their dashboard.  We also follow all the rules for canSPAM even on transactional emails where technically you could get away without some of it.  We developed an automated list cleansing system to make sure we keep hard bounces from getting resent, fixes common typos in domains, only retry soft bounces twice for the same campaign etc.  The list cleansing helped us go from 95% deliverability and a &quot;Good&quot; reputation up to the 97.5+ and &quot;excellent&quot;, which for us helps our clients.  Also, another point, you can use sub-accounts to manage higher risk campaigns etc which can help prevent some of the headaches.<p>Not that this solves mandrill not notifying you, but out of curiosity, do you have webhooks setup?  We extensively use webhooks to tell us what is happening and while they don&#x27;t directly tell you sending has been paused (that I know of), the status of the emails in the webhooks would tell you something is wrong. I know for our platform we have a small component we wrote that monitors when email is being sent and expects to see the statuses updated fairly quickly, if it doesn&#x27;t we get alerted, or if certain percentages of emails start coming back with &quot;bad&quot; statuses as we defined them we get an alert.  I would think if you are sending enough email and using any third party email gateway you would want the same thing.",1436299434

Turns out if you remove all the roadblocks for Uber, you also remove all the roadblocks for everyone else, and Uber becomes just as shitty as riding in a taxi. Where I live, Uber Black Car is stupid expensive (easily 2-3x the cost of a taxi) and UberX is crazy people in barely-functioning cars. As a result, my $150/mo Uber habit has become maybe $20/mo. I know they still make a lot of money off of people with corporate expense accounts, but many of my friends have reverted to taxis (ironically, Uber gave taxi companies a lot more leverage over their drivers and they were able to improve service, at least around here).",1436299265

I joined them because I like the idea of &quot;infrastructure-as-code.&quot; I remember when Docker came around, I was scratching my head. There was a part of me that thought it has something, and another part that was thinking, why would anyone want to use this? Wouldn&#x27;t this set us back to the time when infrastructure is not code? I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it. And what&#x27;s really funny is that the &quot;container&quot; metaphor explains this well -- and I had spent time reading up on the history of physical, intermodal containers and how they changed our global economy to boot. The primary point of intermodal containers isn&#x27;t that it isolates goods from one merchant from another; it is that there is a standard size for containers that can be stacked in predictable ways, and moved from ship to train to truck quickly and efficiently. You are no longer loading and unloading pallets and individual goods; you are moving containers around. Package management. A lot of logistics companies at the time didn&#x27;t get this either.<p>Most of the literature out there explains Docker as virtualization, or some confused mish-mash of &quot;lightweight virtualization&quot;, or &quot;being able to the move containers from one machine to the other.&quot; They pretty much circle around the central point of package management without nailing that jelly to the wall.",1436299253

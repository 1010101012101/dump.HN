But you should consider whether or not you will need SSL\\HTTPS support. libuv is only an IO loop and will not provide this out of the box like nginx. Encryption is important and non-trivial. Most of the projects I&#x27;ve seen end up back at C and embedded Lua\\LuaJIT (similar to OpenResty) rather than writing bindings and tests for SSL in the LuaJIT FFI because of this.",1409291901

8241315,comment,8239848,8239848,4,0,deathanatos,,,"> However, in reality, the flow is constantly exposed to small perturbations: imperfections on the asphalt, tiny hiccups of the engines, half-seconds of driver inattention, and so on.<p>I could see this — random imperfections and subtle movements of drivers causing someone to back off or brake. (I&#x27;ve definitely noticed other drivers being fearful of other drivers solely through their positioning on the road.) Engine hiccups sounds a bit fishy; does that happen to people? That said, I&#x27;ve also witnessed drivers with several hundred meters of open road in front of them — sometimes road as far as the eye can see — inexplicably brake. I&#x27;ve always wanted to ask them why.<p>> Those who drive preventively can dissipate jamitons, and benefit all of the drivers behind them.<p>I think it mostly boils down to listening to your driver&#x27;s ed teacher, if you had one. Leave following distance. Other drivers tend to make this exceedingly hard, but if you can keep enough, you can keep your velocity relatively stable (and hopefully everyone behind you&#x27;s velocity, too!) even when the car in front of you is doing a lot of braking and accelerating. I do it just so I don&#x27;t have to move my foot so darn much in a traffic jam.<p>Likewise, if you pay attention to how much following distance exists in front of the car in front of you, you can predict fairly well when that driver will need to brake and how hard. If they&#x27;re tailgating, you&#x27;ll need a larger following distance yourself if you don&#x27;t want to tap the brake when they brake. I also use this when traffic looks like it&#x27;s speeding up again, and I might want to close the gap in front of me a bit — I take into account how much of a gap is in front of the guy in front of me, to see how likely he is to brake while I try to catch up to him.<p>…of course, these are just my experiences.",1409291711

Google can&#x27;t realistically handle all the edge cases so crowdsource the edge case resolution to the owner of each house. They can decide where they want to put their drop zone containers.

This also works in multi-story apartments where there&#x27;s a common drop zone for the entire apartment and it&#x27;s left to the residents to sort it to the appropriate owners.<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to design a drop chute instead of a drop zone container so that the drone never needs to do the winch thing; the drone drops the package into the chute at it&#x27;s current hover height and takes off while the chute takes care of slowing the package down to the ground.<p>In any case, this is an exciting area ripe for experimentation and bold ideas.",1409290895

If it’s easy to write good tools, those tools are more likely to exist and be correct.<p>• Functions are good basic units of behaviour. This fact is used in most paradigms. The fact that is <i>not</i> used explicitly in most paradigms is that function <i>composition</i> is a good basic way to combine behaviours. (Functional programming being a notable exception.)<p>• Small, modular parts are generally easier to understand than monolithic wholes. Being able to really easily decompose things into small parts helps you write correct programs more easily.<p>• Naming is hard. You can choose to name your intermediate state when it makes your code clearer, but concatenative languages are the only ones that never <i>require</i> named state. The intent is to use names mostly to describe behaviours and how they relate.<p>I have been working on a statically typed concatenative language, Kitten, for a little while now. It’s working in the same problem space as Rust and Nimrod—making low-level programming feel high-level by using type system features to make high-level constructs have low-to-no runtime cost.

The physical remains of the Dorset culture are totally distinct form those of the Thule. Thule oral traditions tell of encounters with the Dorset during their Eastwards expansion.  The Dorset were in contact with viking populations in Greenland, whose accounts can be interpreted as showing the rapid replacement of the Dorset by the Thule. Finally, some small, isolated Dorset populations may have survived until later European contact, although they soon died out as well.<p>The Thule expansion into North America is thought to have coincided with a change in climate, so it&#x27;s possible the shift in climate caused the collapse of the Dorset. It&#x27;s also possible that contact with either the Thule or vikings passed on diseases that could have decimated the Dorset.

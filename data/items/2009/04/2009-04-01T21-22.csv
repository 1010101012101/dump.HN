Honestly the largest issues I've run into with Ruby typically deal with people trying to be too clever.<p>Ruby certainly provides a lot of ways for people who want to look incredibly clever to hang themselves and anyone using their code.  I typically avoid libraries or frameworks where clever code is the norm (I'm looking at you Rails), and because of this I tend not to have too many problems.<p>It's certainly not perfect, and I've been frustrated by bad error messages, stupid type system mistakes, etc.  But I've found that those issues simply replace issues in other languages.<p>I still feel that Ruby gets me from Thought to Code quicker, and for the kind of projects I typically do, that's worth dodging a couple of warts.",1238620087

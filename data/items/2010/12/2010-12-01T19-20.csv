Which is a real big fucking concern for anyone who's thinking about trusting them with their money.<p>OP says it himself with his very first ""lesson"", ""Don’t optimize for the edge-case.""  Then he violates his own first lesson.<p>By complaining about customer service, he just got a small set of sympathetic people to passionately agree.  And accidently got a huge set of potential customers to go away.<p>OP had a difficult experience.  He got bitten by a software bug and horrible customer service.  We've all been there.  We understand.<p>My point is not that I don't sympathize with him.  My point is that he's using his corporate blog to make a small point, potentially costing him huge unanticipated problems on the other side of this.  He may pick up a few raving customer service fans, but how many people will think twice before trusting their money to someone either too green or too lazy to understand a standard airline contract?<p>OP may win this battle, but lose the war.  I imagine he, his co-founders, and his business partners have worked way too hard to risk so much for so little.",1291233536

The best way to find all the gems of a new place and get a real feel for the local flavor is with someone who knows how to showcase it.

The reproduction argument is insufficient to declare viruses non-living. I don't think biologists are trying to pass judgement on viruses, rather I believe the definition of life is less important to them than, say, the cell.

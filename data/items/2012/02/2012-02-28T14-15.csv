3643343,comment,3642106,3643286,9,0,tptacek,,,"Look at it from a mechanically rational perspective. Your protagonist has a mortgage and a family and we're on a tech message board so let's stipulate that this is a technology worker making the average wage for, say, a programmer in Grand Rapids, MI. That's $73,000 (before benefits), or $35/hour for 40 hour weeks.<p>You ask, ""is being stuck in a mortgage with a sick spouse license for an employer to demand 70 hours a week?"". Well, at 70 hours a week, our protagonist is effectively being paid $19.78 per hour. That's almost $2 higher than the average income of employees in Grand Rapids, MI.<p>What you're effectively asking is, should it be lawful for employers to pay people less based on their situation?<p>On the one hand, there are plenty of circumstances where it clearly isn't lawful to do that. For instance, you can't pay people less because they're of Indian origin, or because they practice Judaism, or because they're female.<p>On the other hand, the circumstances of individual employees play into compensation decisions all the time in every job. You are effectively being paid less because of circumstances mostly out of your control any time you take a job outside of San Francisco or New York; the premium earned by technology workers in San Francisco exceeds cost-of-living adjustments significantly.<p>So where do you draw the line? Is the line ""you can't be paid less because of illnesses in your immediate family?"" I'd agree with that rule, but how often does it really come into play?<p>For what it's worth, speaking on behalf of an employer: we don't like 70 hour weeks. We work hard to keep them from happening and, for the most part, people get out the door here in time for dinner (it's hard to say, because some people stroll in the door just in time for lunch). Making people work overtime here, paid or not, is a bad idea because it makes it hard to retain talent. I'd like to think that if there was an economic rationale for overtaxing our team, we still wouldn't do that because it's immoral... but my morals haven't been tested on this issue, because it would be irrational of us to coerce people into working overtime.",1330441068

Perhaps that was because the subscrition page on Startfor was still down, but when I subscribed, it was something like $200 or so a year --- it was less than the cost of WSJ.<p>What I get out of Stratfor, and why I read it, is not ""secret intelligence information"", but <i>analysis</i>.   It may not be as good as what the CIA has, but that's because it truly doesn't have access to ""secret intelligence information"".   But at least they are trying to make sense of facts!   Unlike the New York Times, which acts as a stenographer for the White House (the White House has leaked information from the CIA saying their analysts are sure Iraq had weapons of mass distruction, therefore it must be true) or for politicians (where Arthur Brisbane was caught wondering whether it was OK to label statements form political candidates that were false as not being true in newspaper articles, or whether newspapers should just run the quote), or the Television Evening News, which trot out ""retired generals"" who are still on the consulting payroll of the Pentagon without disclosing that fact.

But hopefully by reading all of that, I can have a more informed view of the world.

That of the 43,000 cases of widowhood, and 112,000 cases of destitute orphanage relieved from the poor's rates in England and Wales alone, it appears that the greatest proportion of deaths of the heads of families occurred from the above specified and other removable causes; that their ages were under 45 years; that is to say, 13 years below the natural probabilities of life as shown by the experience of the whole population of Sweden.'

A lot of players think the way to win is to slam the ball really hard.  The problem with this strategy is that a slam is a high-risk/high-reward shot.  If you do it right, you almost certainly score a point when your opponent fails to return the ball.  If you do it wrong, you give your opponent a point.<p>Modesty aside, I consider myself a ""pretty good"" Ping Pong player.  I can slam the ball when necessary, but I hardly ever do.  I can beat most other players by simply returning every shot with a little backspin.  Hitting the ball hard simply isn't necessary.  All I need to do is wait for the other player to make 21 mistakes.<p>====<p>So even if you have competitors if you execute in a better fashion than they do, and don't f--- up, you can still be the most successful business.",1330439175

Where's the correlation between economy and religion?</i><p>Your argumentation continues in the same vain.<p>But he didn't said that Socio-cultural values have to be THE SAME for economic success.<p>He said that socio-cultural values are a FACTOR for economic success, which is a quite different thing.<p>For example, regarding cultural values: Japan has different values from the US, and China too. That doesn't mean that those kinds of values (Japan/China and US values) are not ALL suited for a successful economy, and a country with a different set of values (say, Mexico) wouldn't do as well.<p>So, the correlation of social values to economic success (which no economist/sociologist really argues against btw), is not that only ONE kind of value system can produce economic success, it's that different value systems do either well or bad on economy.<p>Same for religion, etc.<p><i>Natural resources. Japan has no access to natural resources on their land. Singapore has no resources. Luxemburg has no resources. Switzerland has no resources. Holland has no resources. Funny how all those countries have rather healthy economies.</i><p>Funny, how all those countries have different KINDS of economies. Natural resources is a huge factor for China or US like economic success.

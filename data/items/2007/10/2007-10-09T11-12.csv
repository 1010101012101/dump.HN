65218,comment,65150,65150,0,0,Andys,,,"I've been thinking about this for a long time now.<p>The idea is sound, but I really think what it comes down to ultimately is People.  If you have a bunch of the right people working together, previously difficult things suddenly become possible.<p>My idea revolves like yours around shared infrastructure.  I would like a physical space, with servers, domain registration, payment gateways, and networking already set up, where groups of people can congregate for a long weekend of hacking.  But to really produce quality work, it depends on the quality of the people, and the passion they have for the particular project.<p>Perhaps with enough different groups congregating often enough, eventually good ideas can take shape and good work can be done.  I feel that creation of a platform may be aiming too high, I would be happy for just any type of startup to be created out of it.<p>So I think the idea has merit in some shape or form, but to my knowledge it hasn't been successfully done before.",1191930662
65217,comment,64998,64998,0,0,staunch,,,"The language is less important than your design choices. If you need to support tens of thousands of <i>concurrent</i> connections and want to do it efficiently you should almost certainly use a non-blocking event-based approach. Spawning thousands of processes (even threads) might seem convenient but it's also much less efficient and a headache in its own ways.<p>Take advantage of epoll under Linux and you can probably use any language you want. Brad Fitzpatrick wrote a Jabber server (DJabberd) in Perl that can handle 300k connections in 1GB of memory. It depends what you're doing, but it's highly likely you don't need to choose a painful language for the sake of efficiency.",1191930104

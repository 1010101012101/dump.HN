There is nothing new here.<p>If you look at the populist changes to society throughout history, they are fixing problems that are <i>literally</i> unimaginable to modern western sensibilities.<p>For example, the average age upon death of a working class Londoner in the 1780s was 19. [0]  Can we even imagine that?  People, in huge numbers, dropping off at 19?  So that&#x27;s how we got labor laws.<p>Consider the civil rights movement.  It&#x27;s tempting to blur this with today&#x27;s racial &quot;tensions&quot;, but back then there were cities that would post signs threatening to shoot blacks on sight.  This was common enough that there&#x27;s probably one within an hour&#x27;s drive of where you are right now [1].<p>In 1932, the year that the Nazis came to power, German unemployment was over 30% [2].  That is basically unimaginable for most countries today, and those that are in this ballpark have exactly the sort of unrest (e.g. Greece, Spain) that probably leads to social change.  It&#x27;s certainly way different than anything you see in the US.<p>The thing is, NSA spying or whatever don&#x27;t really rate a mention next to any of these.  Sure, it is a violation of your rights but people don&#x27;t rise up for &quot;on paper&quot; sorts of causes.<p>It is easy for HN and the educated leisure class to paint everybody as &quot;apathetic&quot; or whatever.  But out in the real world, 58% of Americans spend at least one year below the poverty line [3].  People aren&#x27;t worrying about the Orwellian society because they&#x27;re worrying instead about how to pay for Christmas presents for the kids.<p>If you really want the masses to care about whatever HN&#x27;s issue of the day is, the first step is to figure out how to get the masses into the educated leisure class so that they <i>have time to care</i>.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/02/orph-f20.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/02/orph-f20.html</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http://sundown.afro.illinois.edu/content.php?file=sundowntowns-whitemap.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sundown.afro.illinois.edu/content.php?file=sundowntow...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.theholocaustexplained.org/ks3/the-nazi-rise-to-power/economic-issues/effects-of-the-crash/#.UqLdA5GTZXk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theholocaustexplained.org/ks3/the-nazi-rise-to-po...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States</a>",1386406512

As far as I know, all of RDBMSes have their deviations from standard. Or they refer to any SQL-like language, not specific standard? How to interpret that?

The patent bar[1] itself has little to no influence in Washington.  Nobody cares what they think.  Congress cares about what the companies some of these folks work for think, but AIPLA, for example, has never had any real lobbying impact.  They&#x27;ve complained about every rule change, every bill, every everything that has ever &quot;hurt&quot; their members. As far as i&#x27;m aware, there has never been any changes that have resulted from their comments.<p>2. The influence of computer programmers in Washington is mostly due to the fact that they spend time posting here instead of doing anything about anything.  This is an entirely self inflicted wound, and the sooner programmers stop convincing themselves this isn&#x27;t true, the better off they will be.  Watching this happen without fail since <i>1997</i> is one of the reasons i became a lawyer.<p>I would wager a large amount of money if even 1% of the local user groups of programmers of various sorts that still exist, each appointed a representative, and had that person go to their local congressperson/senator, and said &quot;I represent a concerned group of local small business people and programmers, and software patents are destroying our ability to make a living and causing us to lose jobs&quot;, that software patents would have been a solved problems years ago.<p>[1] I&#x27;m also not sure why you keep saying &quot;the patent bar&quot;.<p>The patent bar itself is not of one mind, and there is no real, single organized patent bar that does anything, because the patent bar are those attorneys and agents licensed to practice before the PTO, and since being a lawyer is not a requirement, they come from a variety of walks of life, not just a bunch of attorneys.  The actual patent bar (IE as run by the PTO) offers literally no opinions on anything, and certainly does not lobby, just like the bar of the 9th circuit court of appeals doesn&#x27;t lobby.<p>There are a number of outside organized collections of patent attorneys, like AIPLA, but as mentioned, none are really &quot;the patent bar&quot;.  There is no single mind among these folks, either,  Most of the inside and outside litigators I have met in the corporate realm rail against software patents.  So even &quot;the patent bar&quot; is not consistent here, it&#x27;s more like you have the criminal defense lawyers vs the prosecutors, rather than a single &quot;criminal law bar&quot;.",1386405878

That abundance seems unlikely to vanish anytime soon, as last year ATLAS had 1000 grad students and CMS had 900.<p>In contrast, the INSPIRE Web site, a database for particle physics, currently lists 124 postdocs worldwide in experimental high-energy physics, the sort of work LHC grads have trained for.<p>The situation is equally difficult for postdocs trying to make the jump to a junior faculty position or a permanent job at a national lab. The Snowmass Young Physicists survey received responses from 956 early-career researchers, including 343 postdocs. But INSPIRE currently lists just 152 &quot;junior&quot; positions, including 61 in North America. And the supply of jobs isn&#x27;t likely to increase, says John Finley, an astrophysicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who is leading a search to replace two senior particle physicists. &quot;For the most part, I don&#x27;t think departments are looking to grow their particle physics programs,&quot; he says.<p><a href=\"http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2013_08_29/caredit.a1300185\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previou...</a><p>A warning to non-western members about values at CERN:<p>&quot;The cost [...] has been evaluated, taking into account realistic labor prices in different countries.

The blades take out too many birds and make too much noise.  There is a wind energy project maybe 40 miles from me, the installation of the towers and movement of the dirt has caused dust storms for the local residents.  A funnel system could be longer and have more support of a wider area, requiring less digging.  Big corporations would only switch if they can build it for less and make more money through additional production from each unit so it is unlikely there is big money in developing it, it would have to be a Bill Gates type save the world project and give the designs away for free.",1386405167

I think anyone who can make a sentence such as,<p>&quot;We cleaned up the procedure names manually, and matched the procedure related specialties to the hospital specialty ranking made by US News, and it gives much better perspective to the users&quot;<p>is far beyond making English 101 mistakes confusing objects and subjects of sentences. Actually, in 15 years of on and off English teaching, I have run into very few non-natives who have that issue, since they had to actually study it. I find you to be somewhat unique.<p>In any case, there are plenty of natives who consistently say write and say this, so hopefully a few of them will take it to heart.",1386403693

6865887,comment,6863977,6864987,3,0,lispm,,,"It&#x27;s also easy if you live in Germany or a German speaking surrounding. Being immersed into a German speaking surrounding helps - learning without other Germans from training material is less motivating, so it looks difficult. What actually the difficult part is, is the motivation, not the language. For somebody from an English speaking country learning German is not really difficult - English has lots of Germanic roots. It&#x27;s just that many people in English-speaking countries don&#x27;t learn any foreign language to a competent level, not even the easier ones, so everything looks difficult. What really would be a bit more &#x27;difficult&#x27; is language with a different alphabet (Russian) or a language which is different on many levels (Japanese).\nIt also depends on what level you want to be able to read German. If you want to be able to read philosophers (Kant, Schopenhauer, Hegel, Jaspers, Habermas, ...) then the subject is also difficult - it would help if you understand/know the concepts already - they are often independent of the language.\nEnglish is also difficult. Parts of the language are easy, but the language is huge. I can read many english texts quite fluently, but there are novels where I am at 10% reading speed (compared to english texts from typical news sources) when I want to understand 95% of the words.",1386403366

You can play whatever music you want, without ear-damaging headphones, and you don't have an endless stream of distractions, providing you don't have children.<p>When I'm coding on my laptop I'm probably at 50% efficiency compared to my desktop.  I've got a giant Kinesis keyboard (great tool, but expensive), a big mouse pad, a 24"" monitor, a subwoofer, a second pc, a stack of books, etc.  One cannot replicate such an environment in a coffe shop.<p>A coffee shop is probably great for relaxing, brainstorming, having an occasional change of scenery, and writing children's novels, but I can't imagine it's an efficient way to produce complex software.  Most importantly, I would never be able to concentrate, feeling like I am imposing by sitting in the shop for hours.  Obviously, others enjoy sitting in coffee shops, but how many of you are doing complex work while there?  Or do you save the light work for coffee shop visits?",1217724387

265300,comment,264383,264479,0,0,time_management,,,"""The professions"" is a meaningless distinction these days. Investment bankers call themselves ""young professionals"", even though banking is NOT a profession in the historical sense.<p>Life in most corporations, professional or otherwise, seems to be pretty soul-sucking. Orwell described the ""beetle-like"" type of person, in 1984, who would, with ""swift scuttling movements"", tend to ""flourish best under the dominion of the Party"". Indeed such a type of person is most likely to succeed in large private-sector hierarchies, and the corporate grind involves submitting one's future to the whims of beetle-like masters.",1217723728

265296,comment,264383,264383,0,0,time_management,,,"I'd argue that these ""traps"" stem primarily from risk aversion. While it's best for society that talented people gravitate toward high-risk, high-reward pursuits, the talented individual is still often attracted to a more conservative strategy, having something to lose. Most people are terrified of straying from a well-laid-out career path.",1217723233

And what we commonly call deposits aren't - they're investments and no investment is a sure thing. Any system that pretends that there is a sure thing will fail sooner or later and the bigger the system the more catastrophic the failure.",1223862912

330658,comment,330470,330487,0,0,orianmarx,,,"Yeah I'm worried that it reads like I'm trashing my co-founders, but it's not my intent. I don't think there is any way to reflect on what you learned about what works and what doesn't work in a team environment without the some people interpreting that as trash talking your partners.<p>A couple of things I should probably point out: the SXSW was supposed to be a team trip and the point was for everyone to have the experience of interacting with a bunch of top notch startup people (we aren't from the valley) and I only proposed it a few weeks ahead of time after we had a lot of people telling us that it was the single most useful thing to attend all year (I didn't even know about it before then). Only two of us ended up going, but that wasn't my intention.<p>When we landed the YC interview, it meant flying from NYC to LAX for a ten minute interview. We were told that only I needed to fly out, but I said everyone should go because they deserved the trip. This was obviously not the cost-efficient approach, but I think it was a lot better for the team.<p>As for the Goldman comment, I find this to be a typical programmer retort to any questioning of what they are doing: ""If you're so great, why don't you do it yourself?"" In fact, I didn't question what he was doing for way too long precisely for that reason, and I think that was a mistake. Now as for doing it myself... there are some areas of technical knowledge that I do not have, which is why I brought people on. Now that I'm on my own again, I'm doing my best to get it done myself.<p>Hey, you probably wouldn't want me as a cofounder, fair enough. I appreciate the better luck next time comment though.",1223862531

330646,comment,330493,330493,0,0,wayne,,,"280 Slides is a brilliant technological feat and I would never be bold enough to attempt something like Objective J, but I have to say, I don't see the point of 280 Slides and Google Presentation.  Perhaps it's because I'm a PowerPoint fan boy, but why would anyone use 280 Slides instead of PowerPoint or Keynote?<p>I can only see 3 reasons why you would:<p>- Cost, though most people pirate PPT/Keynote anyway and big companies can afford it.<p>- For people who don't use Mac or Windows or who switch to random computers a lot.<p>- Multi-user editing at the same time on the same presentation.<p>That seems to be a real minority of users though, and for just about every other reason, PowerPoint and Keynote trouce these web-based implementations.  Even basic presentations are faster and easier to make and look nicer in a native app.  For power users, it's no contest.<p>Is there something I'm not getting?",1223861637

330641,comment,330344,330344,0,0,time_management,,,"Ex-hedge quant here. Here's my semi-informed take.<p>Quants didn't write most of these toxic derivatives, and they weren't conceived by computers, at least not as far as I know. Though technological modeling was necessary to value many of these securities (Monte Carlo methods, etc.) I really doubt that any serious financial company would allow a computer to conceive of derivatives to any meaningful extent. But I could be wrong.<p>These contracts, in many cases, were <i>designed</i> to be complex beyond comprehension, but AI methods don't help make them comprehensible to machines. I think of these 500-page derivatives contracts as similar to long software EULAs (which are intended to be so long and dry that 95% ""TL;DR"" and click ""Accept"", while even the diligent 5% miss details)... or to the packets in which health insurance companies detail exclusions. The things are intended to be virtually incomprehensible, making it easy for the writer to fool not only his customers, but also his bosses, by sweeping low probability risks (e.g. an ""unprecedented"" nationwide drop in real estate during a strong economy such as that which existed in mid-2007) under the rug.<p>Quant funds were not hammered because (loosely speaking) the computers emergently ""tricked"" them. They got whacked because all the models were trained on the past, and 8/2007 - Pres. has been unprecedented. Also, the fact that a large number of seemingly independent agents (funds) have piled into the same few strategies means that an unwind from one will lead to losses for many.",1223860884
330640,comment,330110,330110,0,0,lowkey,,,"Just in case there are any angels or venture investors out there, we are working on a startup that competes directly with this technology. My co-founder, easily the smartest engineer I have ever known, has been developing LED drivers and controllers for the past 3 years. This evening he called me to let me know he had passed the 4 Mbit/sec threshold. His goal is to transmit full HD video over optical. This is significant because there is no other method for transmitting Hi-def video wirelessly.<p>It is incredible what can be done with low cost micro-controllers and a little low-level assembly know-how.",1223860846
330639,comment,330139,330319,0,0,tdavis,,,"I want whatever drugs you are on.<p>Read your post. You said it's time to be fearful. That we should be really afraid. That a lot of people are panicking and maybe it's time to join them. I'm paraphrasing, but it's in black and white (well, gray and other gray).<p>Then you come back with this. Essentially, ""I'm making less money, so I need to spend less money."" So, either you don't believe your own words (""rational, non-panicky response"" != ""we should be really afraid"") or you really believe that a slight decrease in your income warrants advocating dangerous responses like mass-fear and panic.<p>Presumably, you live in America. This means that by the mere fact of where you were birthed you have been given, free of charge, essentially all the opportunities that this life holds for a human being. I know first hand how horrible life can be for people not handed what we have been. Your inability to financially continue eating steak dinners every night is so far removed from the constant suffering and strife that you could be experiencing that your entire current view is laughable. If you were living on the streets you'd have it better than hundreds of millions of people in this world.<p>So, no, it's not time to panic. It's not time to be afraid. It's time to survey the landscape, take in the changes, and roll with them. It's time to stop talking about this bullshit. Weather the storm, take advantage of other peoples' fears, and come out on top. It's time to do the same thing any smart, rational, successful person with the right perspective would do.<p>And, no, I will not bookmark this thread. I don't want to be further reminded of just how much people like you take for granted and what you think we should do when life throws us a little curveball.",1223860813

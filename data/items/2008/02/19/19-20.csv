119120,comment,119081,119081,0,0,fiaz,,,"I call vaporware.  Another example of a concept site with impressive demos is streamy.com.  I wouldn't be surprised if these were ""honey pots"" of sorts to collect email addresses of specific demographics (in this case it seems to be different levels of web developers, whereas Streamy was aimed at the Digg/reddit news crowd).<p>The thing that sets me off is the statement: ""As soon as your invitation code hatches we will send it to your inbox.""  Cute way of saying, ""We'll send you and invitation whenever we feel like it; but in the meantime we will do whatever we like with your email address.""  I did notice the guarantee ""We promise not to spam!"", but honestly that promise is as strong as the typeface used to display it.<p>Another factor that tips me off is that they seem to be violating one of the basics of good web application design: HAVE A FOCUS!!!  Like Streamy, there are too many things going on here that promise a lot of possibilities but seem too much to deliver realistically.  I would believe them more if they took perhaps ONE or at most TWO of the things they claim to be releasing and said that this product should be available soon...<p>Given the technology they are developing, I would hope to see a blog article with some substance talking about some of the cutting edge technology that is at least tangentially related to what they are claiming to be able to deliver.  Instead, there are some pics with text of little substance that seem to foster an image of ""coolness"" and design savvy but no indication that they have any real technical ability to deliver what they are advertising.<p>But of course, I could be wrong.... hopefully somebody here can disprove my cynicism (see the reply button below this comment Aviary people/developers/employees?!??!?!).",1203449702

Of course depending on one's position in the software foodchain, what's dreck and what's wisdom might vary.<p>Tom van Vleck's software quality / Black Death analogy makes all the sense in the world to me while I'm nose-down in the code.  To my clients and my managers it's probably worse than gibberish.  Conversely, ""Deming's 14 points"" strike me as meaningless word salad.<p>And if I could mention one I love that's not on that list: ""Premature optimization is the root of all evil.""

119102,comment,118945,118966,0,0,apathy,,,"It's more than that, though -- if you look at this in the context of generic data projection and 'intelligence amplification' software, some (perhaps positive) aspects of the subprime boom were logical outgrowths of more powerful tools for reviewing borrower credit histories.<p>And some of the hugely negative aspects of the subprime mortgage market (and resulting credit crunch) were logical outcomes of Wall Street's insane greed, coupled with derivative financial instruments that allowed risk to be packaged as CDOs without due diligence or oversight.  Give Wall Street a loophole (hell, give any poorly regulated industry a loophole) and the outcome is predictable.  Couple the loophole with automated tools that allow irresponsible people to conduct transactions in the blink of an eye -- an unsupervised ML project, as it were, with an algorithm appropriate only for supervised learning -- and you get a massive financial shockwave...<p>This is not entirely different from the computer-trading aspects of Black Friday, but due to the lax oversight of the fundamentals, it will likely have much longer-lasting aftershocks.  It's unclear whether our next president will have the character to fix the underlying problems, but as usual, the tools have no morals -- it is only their users.  And I've never seen any indication that a moral being can survive on Wall Street, at least not en masse.",1203447815

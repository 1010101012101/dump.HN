9890765,comment,9889609,9890559,0,0,logicchains,,,">If only the Chicago and Austrian schools would change their minds when data supporting their propositions are weak or of low confidence.<p>Many classical and neoclassical economic propositions are of a fundamentally epistemological nature, not strictly positivist. Such as the reasoning that, if without interference person A does action X at time T, X may be taken as the action they most preferred to do at time T, as if it wasn&#x27;t then why would they have done it? In which case any interference with their taking of action X necessarily produces an inferior outcome in terms of their preferences at time T, as they&#x27;re forced to take an action other than their most-preferred action. In this sense a person&#x27;s preference for an action is defined by their taking of that action over all other possible ones when not interfered with, and as a definition its validity is a matter of epistemology, not something subject to empirical analysis. The Austrian school uses this ordinal form of utility as its basis, building upon the idea that interfering with someone&#x27;s free action is the one thing that can clearly be shown to be undesirable as above.<p>The Chicago school, on the other hand, also incorporates a quantitative form of utility, to allow for interpersonal utility comparisons. This requires some epistemological assumptions, for instance that preferences don&#x27;t change over time or their rate of change follows a particular mathematical function, or that if someone buys 3 apples for $30 they value each at $10, rather than e.g. the first at $13, the second at $2, and the third at $15. Austrians dispute the validity of any such assumptions, and hence reach different conclusions.<p>These epistemological foundations are matters of logic/philosophy, and hence no more amenable to empirical analysis than a proposition like &#x27;abortion is immoral&#x27;.<p>Modern economics tends to ignore epistemological issues, and instead focuses on finding the best way to maximise particular empirical metrics, without going into detailed study of the epistemological and philosophical validity of the metrics in question. So it&#x27;s important to distinguish between economics as a tool for predicting and assessing the effects of particular phenomena on particular metrics (econometrics) and economics as an epistemological approach.",1436960155

Ignoring errors is rarely a good idea: APIs change, other programmers read their code and don&#x27;t know about your API, wonder why they ignored the error, &c. You can now also not change your API to ever actually return meaningful errors from that function anymore.<p>Meanwhile, if the failure mode is so well-defined, just put that in the documentation: &quot;panics if the secret key is not exactly 32 characters long.&quot; Let the user of your library worry about it---they will have to, anyway: if they don&#x27;t, they get an error they have to deal with, and suddenly they&#x27;re dealing with it after all.<p>EDIT: From a quick glance, it looks like master gets results back from workers using .Get(<workid>)? Is it easily possible for master to &quot;select&quot; a bunch of workers and get the first completed one? If you use (or at least somehow allow the use of) channels for this, you get all the built-in Go goodness for this kind of control.

It&#x27;s less efficient.  The runtime system has to create and destroy additional closures, increment and decrement additional reference counts, and so on.<p>3. It&#x27;s difficult to interface with procedural code, since your monadic code must be pure.<p>So when do you write monadic code versus procedural code?  In practice, the monadic parts of your code will end up associated with particular tasks that lend themselves to the monadic style.  But why not then specialize this code to its particular task?  In the Treelog example, using specific Treelog terminology instead of generic monad operators would make the code easier to read and understand.",1436958093

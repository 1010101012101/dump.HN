A degree's nice, internships are cute, but with or without them you've got to hustle to make it.<p>Ten years ago I was intermittently working in the trades between bouts of pizza delivery and crashing unemployed on a friend's couch. I get paid mostly to write open source plugins for web CMS's these days. Occasionally I consult if the project's interesting. I've got a decent house and an incredible wife. My change of fortune is utterly unremarkable. No luck involved, just 10 years of hustling, looking for the next angle, working on my skills and networking.",1290402222

I seriously doubt 200 people independently and individually broke into the same test bank, unless it was actually open to students, in which case it was as much fair game as the rest of the Internet.  There are plenty of universities that keep student-accessible test banks and records of old exams (including the two I've attended), so many students probably assumed it was from that type of source.<p>1.5) Also note that the concept of a ""test bank"" that is supposedly inaccessible to students is not entirely common knowledge.

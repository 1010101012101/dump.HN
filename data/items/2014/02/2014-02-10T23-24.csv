He was attempting to stretch out the time it took, and failed. If I put up an ad with the basic premise of:&quot;like this page, and it&#x27;ll download malware&quot; and got likes, the likes would be EXTREMELY suspect, which is what it appeared he was trying to do.

7214640,comment,7209149,7213565,3,0,munchbunny,,,"Web development has stayed pretty democratic since the early days because there is a small number of people pushing technological boundaries while the vast majority work in a well understood space.<p>Game development has consistently been the opposite: in a race to better graphics, better physics, bigger and better everything, game complexity has only gone up. Companies are working with tech that is not open to access by &quot;mere mortals&quot; because they are often proprietary hardware from Microsoft/Sony/AMD/nVidia. As a result of the technological arms race, there is a LOT of platform fragmentation in the graphics world.<p>So the problem is that game development is consistently a &quot;big team&quot; task, and industry expertise is monopolized by companies. Tech trickles down very slowly to hobbyists, so while there are engines for the rest of us to use, they don&#x27;t benefit from the kind of industry battle-testing that web technologies get.<p>Game engines like Unity and Godot seem to be changing this a little bit by simplifying game development - standardizing complexity by abstracting away low level optimization concerns that you&#x27;d really only care about when you need to push technological boundaries. But in general the concept of &quot;convention over configuration&quot; and its related ideas hasn&#x27;t really caught on, so there isn&#x27;t even a standard way of thinking about game engines.<p>The last thing to consider is how much more complex games are than web. Web is mostly a mixture of 2-D graphics and user input handling code. Games are often 3-D graphics (3-D is just much harder than 2-D), often have more algorithmically complex input problems, require audio, and sometimes require real-time networking for multiplayer (web can tolerate latency better). There&#x27;s just a lot more in there.<p>Another problem: because of performance requirements, the vast majority of the core libraries for physics, graphics, etc. are written in C++. C++ is not easy to pick up.",1392076198

7214617,comment,7213826,7213826,1,0,crpatino,,,"I think your critique of Pascal&#x27;s wager is correct, but you fail to see how the same logic applies to your own arguments.<p>1. You correctly notice that Pascal is unable to imagine a reality where there is a God, but it is not the God he happens to worship. However you fail to notice that there are many many realities where neither empiricism is &quot;almost by definition, your only chance of gaining control over your future&quot; or indistinguishible from &quot;randomly made-up laws&quot;. In particular I happen to believe that empiricism is a terrific tool to investigate a subset of reality, but it may be a poor tool to investigate some other subsets (religious/spiritual experience come to mind, but does not have to be the only ones. think of the cases where you investigate phenomena that are practically unreproducible within any humanly relevant timeframe).<p>2. You also see quite clearly that &quot;following certain religious doctrine can have major costs&quot;, which Pascal just hand-waves away in his wager. But you fail to notice that by embracing empiricism as your one an only measure of truthfulness, you incur into a cost of opportunity by cutting off all other possible avenues of human knowledge.<p>Of this last point I offer two examples. First, in your response you mention that &quot;if you can&#x27;t influence it [God] anyhow, why should it [belief in such God] matter&quot;. This is not a matter of actual reality but a matter of values. You cannot argue if this is the good thing to do (ethics) or the most humanly fulfilling thing to do (esthetics?), but just whether this will result in a tangible benefit or not (economics).<p>In a more mundane way, there are lots of experiences of human life that are not easily measured with a scientific mindframe (I mentioned ethics and esthetics before). So we end up reducing &quot;what is beauty&quot; to whatever output of a long series of A/B tests happens to output, or &quot;what is virtue&quot; to whatever utilitarian explanation du jour.",1392075790

You&#x27;ve got to kiss a lot of frogs...<p>Talking books with people whose opinions you trust is a good start.  Then there are internet forums dedicated to discussing books of different sorts.  There are lots and lots of review sites.  One strategy is to find a review site that positively reviews a book you know you like, then see what else that reviewer recommends.<p>You can also find a library and browse the shelves.  Browsing, at libraries and at decent brick-and-mortar bookstores (RIP), is how I found most of the books that I ended up liking the most.  Literally at least three of my favorite books in the world I had never heard of until I picked them up from a bookstore shelf (and two of them, I had never even heard of the author).<p>In a way, reading lists of e-books that are available, rather than going in via a search on an author or title you think you might like, is somewhat akin to browsing.  The main difference being the extremely low quality of the ability to spot-read, that electronic bookstores offer.  The ability to randomly sample a book&#x27;s writing in 4-5 places is an immeasurable aid to finding a book you might like, in my opinion.",1392075693

The targeting specs were fairly broad (cat lovers in four countries). Getting 39 people who like cats to like a page with a cute cat picture in 20 minutes sounds pretty reasonable to me. If you want a specific kind of cat lover, you’d probably want to target even more specifically (like people in a zip code near you).<p>We&#x27;re continually working on making it easier for advertisers to target the right people. Earlier this year I worked on a piece of UI called &quot;Audience Definition&quot; (in our ad create flow), which helps give advertisers guidance on how to target ads more specifically. If you set your advertising too broadly (or too narrowly) -- you get a warning.<p>Fake (and low quality) likes are bad for everyone. We don’t want advertisers to get fans that aren’t good for their business -- we want to help them drive real results, and we can’t do that with bad likes. We invest a lot in improving the systems to monitor and remove fake likes from the system, and also in helping advertisers set smart targeting to help them reach the people they care most about.<p>And to be honest, a lot of people like cats, and the picture on the page is pretty adorable. Lots of real people like lots of things. And LOTS of people like cats. :P\n-Peter",1392075233

Some ways this is done are through reputation systems or moderation tools. Your real name wasn&#x27;t known, but if you wanted to participate in any community you had to follow the community rules. Anonymity wasn&#x27;t a hindrance to good behavior.<p>Facebook and other social networks don&#x27;t usually have much accountability built in. You can be an ass on Facebook and not face any consequences. So Facebook actually only maintains &quot;good behavior&quot; by allowing closed communities (All my friends are well behaved, so all I see on Facebook is good behavior. If I behave badly my friends will react negatively, etc.). If you were able to look outside your own well-behaved bubble, you would see that real-name social networks aren&#x27;t able to enforce good social norms. They just reinforce the social norms that are already dominant in your friend group.<p>An issue with the forced-identity aspect of social networks is you are only allowed one identity. You are discouraged from activities/communities/discussions that are sensitive or embarrassing or not accepted by your dominant peer group.<p>Not to say there is nothing good about these real-name social networks.

The ability to assign static addresses to custom DNS entries makes it even better. The more services that throw up IPv6 support the more useful it gets. If I could pull from Github over IPv6... or run SSL Labs TLS tests against an IPv6 VM...<p>In particular, it is better than other VPN/port forwarding type solutions because it works transparently and universally. It works on your phone (where VPN can be more tricky). It works in environments where you aren&#x27;t allowed to install special relay software. It works when you are a guest somewhere else without them having to change their network setup.<p>As for cloud services... yes and no. In a world with direct addressing you open up many opportunities for innovation in the home cloud appliance market. However, many cloud services are made affordable because they can leverage shared infrastructure, sell usage metadata, or add and remove capacity instantly. Whether home based solutions could be competitive in price and reliability without those abilities. I see some categories of service that it makes sense for, others, less so.<p>Security is a concern, yes, but one that can and should be addressed by good security tools and practices (firewalls, automatic security updates, good backups, not running services you don&#x27;t use, etc) not by crippling your network with NAT.",1392074188

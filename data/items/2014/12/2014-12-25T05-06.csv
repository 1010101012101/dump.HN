So, I am going to echo one of Greg’s picks because it was on my list but for a different reason. ‘Seeing like a State’ is an amazing book. And I think it’s drastically changed the way I look at software, not for the same reason as Greg talked about but because it shows why what we do is hard. ‘Seeing like a State’ talks about all the subtleties of human systems and human interactions at the local context level. It talks about all the improvisation that everyone does on a day-to-day basis and how in real human communities, we’re constantly changing the system to adjust to a slightly different reality, to corner cases we hadn’t seen before but now we have. It’s shifting and it’s not well-defined. And suddenly it makes complete sense that the hardest part of software is figuring out what we want to do. That’s it. It’s a great book.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp...</a>",1419486655

Engineers are supposed to understand both theory and practice. Your engineering course at university teaches you how to think and not just how to complete a task. Being able to think about a problem and solve it using experience and scientific knowledge is what differentiates a construction site foreman from an engineer with equal years of experience.",1419486650

But until I see it, I won&#x27;t believe that you or anyone can pull it off at a price that&#x27;s competitive (or equal) to a Macbook Pro/Air.<p>Apple&#x27;s laptop line is actually quite competitive. The keyboard (layout), trackpad (quality/design), integration of hardware and software (battery life + feel), and overall build quality are what sets Apple apart from the competition. I have yet to buy an Apple product, but I also haven&#x27;t replaced my laptop in over 3 years. Every time I think of doing so, I go through the same exercise:<p>1. Eliminate laptops with idiotic layouts (I&#x27;m one of those people that type with the right shift key). This first step already cuts out the majority of low cost laptops.<p>2. Filter by battery life. Suddenly Apple pricing isn&#x27;t looking that bad.<p>3. Filter by specs - screen, etc. Now you are left with laptops that are all in the same (or higher!) price range as Apple.<p>And this is all before taking into account other factors like Linux compatibility. By time I get the list down to models that are competitive with Apple, the price is almost always equal or higher. And usually, none work 100% perfectly with Linux. So I end up buying nothing.<p>If you could pull off such a piece of hardware, where the hardware is designed to fit the distro&#x27;s look and feel (a very underrated pro for Apple products in my opinion), at a competitive price, I&#x27;d be first in line to buy one.",1419486566

In the 1990s, an eighteen-year-old headed to Australia to realize his worldly dreams. With little money or support, he struggled to survive there. Two
years later, he was earning an annual income of $250,000; by the age of twenty-six, he was a multimillionaire. Yet, worldly success was merely a way station
on a journey that began years ago. As an eight-year-old, he saw a vision of God in a dream, an experience that left him with a sense of deep joy and peace.
The dream triggered off his desire to meet God, to see a manifestation of the Divine. He practised astrology, intense meditation and tantra, yet God was
nowhere in sight. Deeply frustrated, he dived into materialistic pursuits to distract himself from the restlessness within. After years of living the good
life, he found he could no longer ignore the old restlessness; worldly pleasures just couldn’t fill the void within. He moved back to India and finally
did what he had always yearned to do: renounce the world and become a monk. In the Himalayas, in terrifying silence and solitude, Om Swami practised intense
meditation. Death was always close as he confronted starvation, the fierce elements and wild animals. Finally, his sadhana brought him to the ultimate

</code></pre>
True, but the industrial section of the US was not in the slave states, it was in the Northeast.  The majority of industrial labor was free men.  I would imagine working conditions varied greatly, but interpreting things through a modern lens is fraught with problems.<p>I do think people overlook the importance of the Mississippi in the growth of the US.  It is an amazing route for goods right in the middle of the country.  Even today, barge traffic is a huge driver of export goods.<p>// on a side note - I am pretty sure I will disagree with this book if the article is any indication, although I will have to read the book first.  The 1800s (laws & transportation) were very important for the US and it could be said the early 1900s did a number on economic freedom.  The one line in the article can be argued.  Also, 1945 was not as important as 1946-48 for the baby boom.",1419483942

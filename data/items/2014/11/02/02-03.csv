In a trial, the prosecution has to make its case, not just before the judge and jury, but in principle, before the entire public. And the public gets to see the quality of the evidence being presented.<p>Bypassing the trial lets the prosecution work in darkness, and darkness invites corruption or incompetency, even if only in the name of getting the job done more efficiently.<p>I&#x27;m thinking out loud here, but maybe the problem isn&#x27;t the plea bargain, but the pleading process itself. It might be less subject to abuse if the prosecution had to present its evidence before the court and in public, and if the judge could reject the plea and compel a trial.",1414897084

We have noisy systems that may fail catastrophically operating everywhere with some low probability noise vector, but we manage those probabilities.<p>Unless of course it <i>is</i> an adversarial application and the network is made public; but then I think there are other also simple ways of defeating the attack, e.g. some random smoothing (so that the smoothing isn&#x27;t also attacked), adding some more noise, etc.",1414897044

So be careful how you shop for citizenship</i><p>Of course, people should do their homework before purchasing expensive insurance policies that might or might not pay out when the need arises.<p>If you follow the social contract tradition of Western political philosophy to its logical conclusion, a state is just that: a glorified insurance policy that people feel compelled to buy in order to avoid the various dangers and inconveniences of statelessness. In exchange for regular premiums (taxes), you get assurance that a bunch of dudes with guns and bombs will protect your life, liberty, and property from anyone who dares to harm you. The fact that you also happen to be a shareholder (citizen) of this insurance company is a nice perk, because it means it&#x27;s at least theoretically possible to make the company&#x27;s interests align with yours. But that doesn&#x27;t change the fundamental fact that the state is a glorified insurance company.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see that a lot of the baseless romanticism and fanaticism that used to surround statehood during the last couple of centuries are finally fading away in favor of a more rational analysis of costs and benefits. Right now, it&#x27;s only happening with millionaires who have much to gain and lose.

8545349,comment,8544775,8545209,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Their job (or at least their office&#x27;s job) is also to decide when and where to seek prosecution. In theory, determining truth and innocence is a significant part of their job.<p>There are a couple of problems with this:<p>1. When everyone is guilty of something, prosecutorial discretion is a disaster, not a desirable feature of the system. It&#x27;s nothing other than the power to bankrupt and/or imprison whoever you don&#x27;t like.<p>2. They don&#x27;t do things by assessing truth and innocence. When my great-grandfather&#x27;s mind went, some member of another branch of the family got appointed conservator of his estate, and proceeded to embezzle over $600K in &quot;gifts&quot; to herself and her family. My mother discovered this by coincidence, assembled a huge pile of damning evidence, and went to a prosecutor, who said he wouldn&#x27;t bother charging her because she was a middle-aged woman and getting a conviction would be almost impossible.<p>My mother ended up suing, and on advice of counsel settled for the documented value stolen, rather than the full legal liability (which is a multiple of the losses). The theory there, as I recall, was &quot;judges hate it when you go to trial even after being offered a settlement, so you should take the settlement&quot;.",1414894517

This was real shocker. As you said, we didn&#x27;t have realistic assumptions - it started as fun project and we thought we will abandon it like previous one. Only with time we realised this can really be something.<p>> If the existence of competition worries you enough to consider abandoning your venture before you have even launched and after you have asked others to invest money in it, you must honestly ask yourself whether you will have the stomach to keep going when you encounter real challenges, like technical hurdles that threaten your existence or disagreements with your friends/co-founders.<p>That&#x27;s excellent questions. Luckily, after initial shock, I think this motivated us to work even harder. We don&#x27;t want to give up on idea we really believe in just because someone else was couple months faster. We were postponing launching our app for a long time, and now we decided to just finish most important missing items and put it in Play store.<p>It also finally motivated me to reach out my network and try to at least have initial meeting with <i>real</i> investors in London. So far we only pitched to friends who probably might have been a bit too supportive.",1414894214

8545334,comment,8544911,8544911,0,0,abeppu,,,"(a) The document linked by the OP is to a blog post that discusses and extensively quotes another blog post [1] which in turn discusses an actual paper [2]. Naturally the paper is where the good stuff is.<p>(b) Both blog posts somewhat understate the problem. The adversarial examples given in the original paper aren&#x27;t just classified differently than their parent image -- they&#x27;re created to receive a specific classification. In the figure 5 of the arxiv version, for example, they show clear images of a school bus, temple, praying mantis, dog, etc, which all received the label &quot;ostrich, Struthio camelus&quot;.<p>(c) The blog post at [1] wonders whether humans have similar adversarial inputs. Of course it&#x27;s possible that we might, but I suspect that we have an easier time than these networks in part because:\n  (i) We often get labeled data on a stream of &#x27;perturbed&#x27; related inputs by observing objects in time. If I see a white dog in real life, I don&#x27;t get just a single image of it. I get a series of overlapping &#x27;images&#x27; over a period of time, during which time it may move, I may move, the lighting may change, etc. So in a sense, human experience already includes the some of the perturbations that ML techniques have to introduce manually to become more robust.\n  (ii) We also get to take actions to get more/better perceptual data. If you see something interesting or confusing or just novel, you choose to focus on it, or get a better view because of that interestingness or novelty. The original paper talks about the adversarial examples as being in  pockets of low probability. If humans encounter these pockets only rarely, it&#x27;s because when we see something weird, we want to examine it, after which that particular pocket has higher probability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/7352-the-flaw-lurking-in-every-deep-neural-net.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligenc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199</a> or <a href=""http://cs.nyu.edu/~zaremba/docs/understanding.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.nyu.edu/~zaremba/docs/understanding.pdf</a>",1414894055

The book, IIRC, also suggests the idea that people have a &quot;primary&quot; language, and this is AIUI contested and in my opinion likely to be pop-sci nonsense. My wife scores highly on everything except gifts, which she thinks she likes in the abstract but tends to not really be that impressed when they manifest in the concrete. I suspect that many people have varying profiles that often resist being able to call one &quot;primary&quot;, but the real point here is that it gives you a good set of five things to think about, discuss with your partner, and try out. (Because you have to bear in mind that humans are shockingly bad at guessing what will make them happy. That&#x27;s a general rule, not a relationship rule. In particular that implies that you should not abandon one of the types until you have <i>tried</i> it, pretty much regardless of what your partner says. And, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, regardless of what you say your partner should, ideally, try it anyhow to see how it goes.)<p>As another example, consider the idea that some people generally want to have their problems heard but don&#x27;t want them &quot;solved&quot; in the conversation [1]. Regardless of whether or how true it may be in general, it again gives you a dimension to think about, consider with your partner, and experiment with, because in the end, everybody is their own person. My wife would clock in somewhere around 80/20; 80% she&#x27;s just expressing herself and not looking for solutions, but maybe a fifth of the time she&#x27;s at least open to thoughtful suggestions (as if nothing else it shows I&#x27;m fully engaged). Your mileage <i>will</i> vary.<p>And so on; rather than necessarily taking anyone&#x27;s advice here directly, consider it a possible dimension to explore with your partner. With everything mentioned here you&#x27;ve probably got a good set of things to consider.<p>Further, for all of these things, you&#x27;ll want to work out not only your partner&#x27;s preferences, but your own, and some may surprise you even though you&#x27;ve lived with yourself for your entire life. Know thyself has been good advice for a very long time.",1414893671

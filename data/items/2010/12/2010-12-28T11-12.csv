It is?<p>I do quite a bit of work inside an ubuntu installation on VirtualBox that is setup for a maximum of 1gb ram and it seems to work fine (I haven't seen a computer with less than 1gb of RAM installed in years, but I've also never been to a Russian school, so who knows).<p>A default ubuntu installation with the gnome desktop loaded up shows about 800mb free out of that 1gb, and I am sure a nice chunk of those 200mb include stuff other than gnome.<p>Pretty sure it would be a bit sluggish at times, but it would probably still be very usable even if you only had 512mb of RAM.",1293534599

Most people lie on a spectrum between E and I (Extrovert and Introvert). We all have quiet time and noisy times and whilst you could consider yourself an Introvert since this is what you prefer, it could be very context sensitive. I expect if you profiled many tech entrepreneurs they would tend to be some sort of hybrid between E and I.",1293534554

The downside is that most companies have forked the OpenACS code internally (including universities using dotLRN) --- that code never made it to the outside world. If you needed an extension, it has always been the case that you had to write it yourself. Developers are indeed an often scarce good but that has worked well for those of us that are still around.",1293534269

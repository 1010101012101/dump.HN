An oar is a second degree lever, meaning the fulcrum is somewhere along the shaft a few inches above where it meets the blade. Thinking of the oarlock as the fulcrum is incorrect because the goal is to move the boat, not the oarlock. Ideally the oar shouldn't move in the water at all, but in reality it actually moves forward somewhat over the course of the stroke. This actually creates a small pocket of water vapor in front of the blade which is a form of cavitation; if this weren't the case then the blade would be very difficult to feather.",1207061163

The . command (mentioned in the article) is wonderful.<p>Also, I love vim's macro support.  For example, I usually define a macro that converts 'var' statements on separate lines into a single statement broken into multiple lines.  (MTASC won't let you refer to previous vars defined in the same statement, so if I change the data dependencies, I usually have to change the formatting.)  The entirety of the macro is `qa^dw>>[UP]$s,[ESC][DOWN][DOWN]q`.  That's `qa` to start recording a macro into register `a`, ^ to move to the first non-blank character, dw to delete a word ('var ', in this case), >> to shift the line left by 4 spaces, UP moves up a line, $ goes to end of line, `s,` substitutes a , for the ; at the end of line, ESC gets back into command mode, the two DOWNs put me on the line below where I started, and q stops recording.  Then if I want to replace 5 lines of variable declarations, I can do 5@a (invoke macro a 5 times), and since each macro ends exactly one line lower than it started, it'll do the whole block for me at once.",1207061011

By that I mean, that current broadband will have to increase again to higher speeds. I mean, it makes sense that your parents can still run a 3-4 year old system if the most cpu intense program they run is Skype. These programs probably won't need the crazy cores until they start processing far greater amounts of data.<p>However, there is the issue that your typical user interface is becoming more and more graphic intensive. And there's always that end consumer that runs a million apps and never closes them. A few of my non-computery friends are like that and have a bajillion things in their system tray. They too will probably see performance improvements from multiple cores, long before the apps they use take advantage of it, simply because of their habits.",1207058814

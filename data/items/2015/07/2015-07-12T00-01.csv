But the way Schäuble has acted, it is by now clear that a reasonable deal is unlikely to be possible. For Germany this is all about ideology, not about economic rationality (amusing they accuse Tsipiras of being too ideological).<p>In that instance, what could they hope for? Their winning scenario is to demonstrate to their own constituency that they&#x27;ve tried everything. They&#x27;ve stretched extremely far. They&#x27;ve demonstrated to their home audience how Germany wants to humiliate them rather than get a fair deal.<p>They&#x27;ve further managed to create substantial cracks in the Euro group facade, with France in particular now openly having taken their side.<p>If they exit, then it is clear the Euro must be reformed if it is to survive.<p>They may in the end have permanently tarnished Merkel&#x27;s and Schäuble&#x27;s political legacies. Justifiably so.<p>Would any of this have happened if they had played ball and agreed to a toxic, unsustainable deal? The previous Greek government played ball, and what they got was a death sentence for the Greek economy. Playing ball with these opponents is a bad idea, since they seem intent of kicking in your knees first.<p>> It is a little bit if your wife threatens you with divorce and you say: OK, let&#x27;s do it.<p>If you&#x27;re told that to stay you will need to subject to daily beatings, then divorce is the right choice.",1436662541

(caveat: i&#x27;d never confront an intruder without my life or my families life in danger.)<p>Guns have hosts of failure modes, and require specialized knowledge on their operation to ensure safety. Guns can even fire accidentally, with an accidental discharge on dropping the firearm being a possibility on any gun without a firing pin block (which is practically any long gun, the kind you can buy at Walmart in some states, with no waiting period in some states). A poorly handled gun may shoot in a totally unpredictable trajectory, and a first time user would be unlikely to consider collateral damage. (Nursery behind the attacker?)<p>A knife mishandled usually leads to non-life-threatening self-injury. A knife can be dropped, but will only damage those around it that are wearing inappropriate footwear. A knife has very few mechanisms, and only has as many mechanical failure modes as there are gimmicks on the knife; with some having zero mechanical failure modes possible besides faults that are metallurgical in nature. A knife can be wielded poorly with zero training; a first time gun user may never find the safety without assistance, let alone loading and reloading. A knife results in very low collateral damage.<p>Basically : I&#x27;d rather put a limiter on a novice in combat than give him or her weapons in which they put themselves and their family in even greater danger by their own naivety.

Then you invoke what <i>does</i> intrinsically matter to recognize that this is an unacceptable solution, because you&#x27;ve actually destroyed everything that matters.<p>What does matter is reliable, flexible decision-making capabilities, and killing someone is just about the worst way to achieve that (barring that the person you kill isn&#x27;t doing more damage than good in this regard.) Suffering is bad because it causes people to make bad decisions.<p>And that isn&#x27;t something you can easily argue is true for the situation I was responding to.",1436659458

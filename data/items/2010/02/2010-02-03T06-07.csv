When they ask why I wouldn't want to work there, my response is ""You will pay me $100k-$120k. I can make $140k-$160k elsewhere"". They start going into this schpeel about their 20% ""free time"", their stock grants, their free shuttle (Living in SF and would have to commute 2 hours a day to get there). Their culture.

First of all, he/she likely makes at least what..80k? 90k? I understand it's not a million dollars a year but that's not a bad salary. 
Second of all, there are people that would accept a lot less than that simply to work at google. 
I used to cook professionally, and was at one point working for FREE at Corton, in NYC, solely so that I can say I worked and learned there. All the cooks who work in fine dining get paid horribly but work there to learn from the best. This should be the same for hackers.

The first time I tried to compile PHP ( 5.3.2 ) on an upgraded ( Leopard -> Snow Leopard ) machine, I had a million problems with the system's iconv and had to recompile a million packages.  I then had to delete my iconv stuff, recompile it into /usr/local, then figure out exactly which binary from the original install to leave behind so that things would be detected properly with everything else.  I think a lot of that has to do with php's build and search paths ( eg, it was finding headers in /usr/local, but trying to link to binaries in /usr ) but I can't help but feeling that with a proper package manager, that never would have happened.

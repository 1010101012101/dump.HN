5562396,comment,5561231,5562224,4,0,ismarc,,,"It's actually more complex than that.  You can use val and def in the same places.  The difference is when it is evaluated.  val has the right hand side evaluated immediately (such as, if it's a class member, it will be evaluated when the class is constructed).  def has the right hand side evaluated every time it is referenced.  So, val x = 5+5 would evaluate 5+5 and assign to x.  def x = 5+5 would set x to a function that takes no parameters and returns an int, but if you had, say x + x, that function would be called twice, resulting in a value of 20.<p>This difference is stark when you look at what it's doing, but allows for some interesting uses when combined with lazy vals.  We use it pretty extensively in our configuration loader (using twitter-eval) that allows us to do per-value overrides of configuration files by using lazy vals assigned to defs and then using the defs in the application (of all the performance bottlenecks we have, the possibly optimized out function call generated for the defs is negligible).  The end result is that you can derive values from configuration settings prior to the configuration finishing being loaded.  This means we don't have to care what order the configuration files are loaded in (they're separated by what they're configuring, with many shared between applications).",1366167454

That's dramatic to say the least.<p>The comparison is perfect. With $13 billion in cash now, and no real debt, Qualcomm has begun talking about building their own fabs in the future. Which is exactly what they will do by necessity. They already make more money than TSMC. The notion of relying on TSMC long term would be absurd as Qualcomm grows so much bigger than them.

Consider instead:<p><pre><code>    [True, SpinForever()]\n</code></pre>\nYou can consider any ""variable"" in Haskell to have a value of the type of that variable or the bottom value. The bottom value is tech-speak for no-value at all, since it means that the program has gone into a infinite-loop trying to produce the value.<p>Eagerness would fix this since, such a program as above would always cause a infinite-loop, and thus the program would no longer be a useful construction. While with lazy evaluation it only spins if you try to evaluate any more than the first element in the list.<p>Of course you could also fix this by going with total programming which basically removes the implicit bottom-value from the language.

5562290,comment,5561461,5561863,11,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"There are a number of problems with doing things like this.<p>The first is that significant speed differentials are extremely dangerous. Uncalibrated speedometers are very common and very inaccurate. Anything that causes guaranteed enforcement is going to reduce safety because people will start religiously following their speedometer instead of the normal flow of traffic, so now you have people driving all different speeds than one another based on how badly and in which direction their speedometer is miscalibrated. On top of that you have a situation where anyone who has made a stop for coffee or gas is exempt from the timer because of the stop, so you put a number of people driving 15MPH over the limit (because they stopped and aren't subject to the timer) on the same road as people driving 15MPH under the limit (because they haven't stopped and their speedometer is inaccurate) and you're going to see more collisions.<p>Then there is the pragmatic problem. Speeding tickets are big money <i>because</i> the law is enforced sporadically under unpredictable conditions. To generate revenue, enforcement has to be rare enough that it doesn't induce compliance. And the proposed scheme is entirely deterministic. Everyone who doesn't make a stop will discontinue their speeding between toll booths -- which is ostensibly the intended result, except that it means the scheme will generate no money and will deprive the government of existing ticket revenue that would have been generated on that stretch of road. Meanwhile it reduces the need for police presence, which means you'll have to fight the law enforcement unions to boot. It's not at all surprising that there has been little interest in implementing it.",1366165846

Remember, eBay feedback is calculated over 12 months.<p>If you have a chain of good sales, don't sell for a while, sell again, and something happens that causes the buyer to leave a neg, you are in <i>deep</i> shit with eBay.<p>Your listing fees will be higher, your number of listings will be restricted, you have funds availability holds from PayPal.. it's a real mess. Lesser things can and have put people out of business.<p>If you are primarily an eBay seller this can completely ruin your business.<p>Now, obviously this is the absolute worst case scenario, but the point is the amount of negative feedback you need to start getting really nasty restrictions put on you is miniscule. Anything that drops you below 98 or 95% positive (haven't been a seller for long enough that I honestly forget the exact number) is enough.<p>Going back to the subject of the TFA, (and we're venturing deep into conjecture territory here, but bear with me) what if they ended up with a faulty scale that weighed everything a pound less than it should be, and as a result a cluster of buyers ended up with packages postage due?<p>If it weren't for eBay this would be no problem. You make it right with your customers, refund them, maybe give them a future discount for their trouble, hopefully most of them are happy and you continue on your merry way.<p>Instead, the buyers are encouraged to vent on the feedback system, which is tied <i>directly</i> into how the platform treats you. Even if you make it right, there's nothing stopping a buyer from trashing on you, and your recourse is precisely jack and shit.<p>There are three very important things to remember here:<p>1. eBay is enough of a jerk to sellers that you should <i>really</i> think twice before submitting bad feedback, especially if they fixed their screwup. This is what neutral is for. The seller got you your item but did so in such a way that you don't want to increase their reputation.<p>2.

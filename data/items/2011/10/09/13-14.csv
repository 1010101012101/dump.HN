3090445,comment,3089352,3089754,1,0,marquis,,,">lived in a world completely untouched by it<p>War has certainly touched the U.S. youth as we've seen massive internal shifts on personal liberty (e.g. TSA, security guards in school, signs in public transport that ask you to monitor your fellow citizens). The youth is also clearly able to see that the U.S. spends a disproportionate amount on the military rather than enriching it's own culture and people's lives. Much like the Occupy Wallstreet movement I would expect to see a call, by the upcoming generation, to demand that their birthright is not continued to be sucked dry by the military.<p>Spike Jonze's short film ""Scenes from the suburbs"" is an insightful example of how we might imagine a further deepening militarization of the U.S. Sadly it does not seem so far fetched to me.",1318168338

So you have a general solution to the n-body problem? I'm being facetious, of course. The hardness of the n-body problem isn't necessarily an expression of fundamental randomness rather than technical uncertainty. But one way or another, aren't they both an expression of the same thing?<p>Modeling an n-body system in the physical universe exactly means modeling every piece of information in the universe. If you don't do that, the unknowns will multiply into significant divergence at some t, however distant. Quantum theory suggests that even if you did have a computer the size of the universe that didn't affect the universe, it is <i>intrinsically</i> impossible to make an accurate prediction.<p>I can't know where a particle will be in a second, or even if it will exist at all. I can't know if the Earth will be hit by an asteroid in a hundred years. I can't know who will win the Presidential election next year. The more accurately I model these systems, the more their outcome (or rather the outcome of the abstract macro-system of which I become aware) becomes dependent on the few things I don't know-- to the point that simply the act of checking the accuracy of the prediction has an unpredictable effect.<p>At that point, it seems like splitting hairs to say ""Yes, but it's still <i>really</i> deterministic."" What ""real"" are you talking about? Certainly none that I have experience with. But that doesn't matter either, because even granting that:<p>The universe <i>might</i> be deterministic, and it <i>might</i> be nondeterministic. It's unpredictable. So how does <i>determinism</i> become the default?",1318167024

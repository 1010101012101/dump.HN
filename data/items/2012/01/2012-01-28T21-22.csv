3523399,comment,3512434,3512434,1,0,throwaway1970,,,"Many of the articles about Kim Schmitz / Dotcom / Kimble quickly brush over the calling card fraud in 1994. I think it is an important part of the story.<p>For those of you not familiar with the early 90's phreaking scene, calling card fraud came to the fore as a timely replacement to blueboxing (which the telcos had recently killed off). Calling cards also had a inherent transferable value, so they had the added attraction that you could use them as a means of barter.<p>A large number of people were busted at the same time (late 1994)(worldwide) for trading calling card numbers that cost MCI, GTE and AT&T millions in the early 90's. I've heard numbers up to $50 million quoted as combined losses. My guess is that Kimble has been on the US Secret Service  watch/hit list since 1994 when they failed to have him extradited to the US to face the calling card fraud (conspiracy) charges.<p>Many of those busted in the USA went to prison. James Lay was the guy that wrote the software to intercept the card numbers at the switch level and then went on to sell on an estimated 60,000 card numbers through a worldwide network of dealers. I think Kimble was one of those card dealers in Germany.<p>A large number of the accused were barely 18 years old when they were busted and US extradition requests were denied due to their age. The Secret Service busts were well organised and had to be executed and coordinated quickly worldwide (no mean feat). This took a great deal of negotiation with foreign governments and cost a great deal of effort and money. They then had to watch as one by one those accused abroad were given hand slaps, charges were dropped, deals were done, and court cases collapsed or never even made it as far as a court room. That must have been very frustrating after all of that effort.<p>Many of those busted were thought to have been 'turned'. It was also reported that Kimble 'put himself forward' and allegedly 'offered' to help crack a pirate software BBS group.<p>Also worth noting is that many of the cards that came into Europe went directly east to the mafias in those new border countries that had previously been the other side of the iron curtain before the Berlin wall fell. Being in Germany (at this time being a EU external border country) meant that Kimble may well have had some contacts in those countries that the BND (German Federal Intelligence Service) might have been very interested in.<p>tl;dr The Secret Service never forgets!<p><a href=""http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+ring+leader.-a019474647"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+ring+leader.-a019474647</a>

Is it? I recall more than one person arguing that Hollywood is making more money than it has in years past. Now, that may in fact still be a loss, if they're also paying more people than they were in the past --- unless the ""made more money"" is net rather than gross. However, for the sake of argument, let's say that they are dying. Well, then.<p>2) ""it's because of theft."" Is it? Is it really? I haven't seen their bank books. Are they loosing money because they're spending more money on special effects and not getting the returns they want, maybe? What shows are losing the most money? How many people watch them? How many pirate? What percentage of all people that watch that show/movie pirate it? What shows/movies are the big favorites? Do those shows/movies have a higher piracy-percentage than others?<p>Next thing. Movie theaters. Overpriced for the standard occasion. Did anyone evaluate if the price of a movie at a movie theater might actually be reducing attendance and thereby reducing profits? I recall this nice graph that compares supply vs demand; and I believe it can relay price vs value. Perhaps they're vastly exceeding the sweet spot.<p>Furthermore, we're in a recession. There are a ton of people out there without jobs. No job = less/no money. No money = ... spending your money on luxuries? Nope!<p>I'm sorry, but while it may in fact be greed vs greed, I cannot accept his argument that piracy is killing Hollywood. I need more data on the things I listed, especially where Hollywood is putting their money, and what the piracy percentage is. Until then, I do not accept that as the answer.",1327786773

I'm merely pointing out that there is a mythos surrounding Jobs that he was some sort of design god or product messiah. The only thing he ever was was a businessman. If your opinion of him changes knowing that he colluded to keep his cost of engineering low (much the same as he manipulated the market for flash memory to keep those prices low), then you probably didn't pay enough attention in the first place.<p>Of course, that's the danger in a cult of personality, isn't it?",1327785211
3523297,comment,3523024,3523188,5,0,smoody,,,"Agreed. 37Signals generates numerous ""lessons learned"" posts under the pretense (implied or otherwise) of helping other people learn from their experience. If they don't see it that way, they should add the text ""This design is ours and if you copy it or produce anything that looks like it, we'll publicly humiliate you f'ers and insult your investors as well!"" to the beginning of each of their supposedly educational posts.<p>Or, they should spell out the degree to which something has to be changed before they'll be okay with it. Such as ""you can put a big customer image on the page because, well, we didn't invent that. You can also put screenshots on the page because, well, we didn't invent that either. And same goes for customer quotes, checklists, and company logos. But we'll take you down if you put checklists with green checks to the right of the giant customer image, a quote to the right of the client's head, and two screenshots below the checklist, etc., etc.""<p>That said, it is an unfortunate that Curebit linked to 37's assets instead of creating their own. And it is clearly a copy beyond just the linked assets. But I don't think it's an international incident on the order of Wikileaks or such. But that's how it's being treated for some reason.<p>Personally, I would have emailed Curebit privately and asked them to change it instead of trying to tarnish an individual's and company's reputation. That's called ""<i>being civil</i>,"" but that's not how 37Signals works. Remember the time Google created something that resembled Campfire as a demonstration of what Google App Engine could do? It was a 3-pane window with a chat log on the left, the name of the room and a list of people in the room on the right, and a text entry area across the bottom. 37Signals treated it as if they were the first and only company to develop a chat client that worked that way. Here's a link to that incident: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/08/google-to-close-huddlechat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/08/google-to-close-huddlechat/</a><p>Here's the choice (dangling) quote: <i>""were just disappointed that they stooped so low to basically copy it feature for feature, layout for layoutWe thought that would be beneath Google, but maybe its time to reevaluate what they stand for.""</i><p>Really?",1327785181

I was thinking more like 175k."" then I don't think you're going to be stuck at a 10-25% upward mobility.<p>You might blow thenegotiation, but you aren't stuck at 80k+25% max. And you shouldn't be worried about blowing negotiation. If 125k would work for both of you, it's still possible after this start. If they are rational, and you are rational, there is no reason you can't proceed to figure that out.<p>Since you can always do something like this to totally ignore/invalidate/reject their first number, I don't think letting them give the first number is dangerous.<p>But if they say 80k and then you say ""let's add 5k because reason X, and 5k because reason Y"" and then after that you try to get another 5k for reason Z, repeat, then yeah you're going to have a hard time getting very far away from the 80k initial number.<p>Meanwhile if you say the first number and give 175k, then if they are terrible at negotiating they might not be able to lower it more than 10-25%, but don't count on that.<p>How many people are competent at negotiating and able to rejecting initial frames when appropriate I'm not sure. If you are terrible at negotiating, or you think the other guys might be bad at it, then in both cases I guess saying the first number is safer. But be warned: if you say a high number and they suck at negotiating too much, they might just not hire you. Sometimes there is a number you can agree on but they ask you to come down to a number above their max and then even though you say ""sure"" they still have to come up with a reason to cancel the deal.

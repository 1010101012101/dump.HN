And since closures can (usually) be statically determined, they can use an offset lookup for the closured variable in place of a hashtable.

But you&#x27;re not going to have many people to talk to.<p>I think the tradeoff for having an iOS app is worth it.

Maybe I am sick mentally. Maybe I just don&#x27;t belong.<p>For the past 20 years, my life has been a joke. I live in B.C, Canada. A few years ago, I traveled 21 hours by plane to see what my father looked like. He didn&#x27;t want me, didn&#x27;t even call me his son. My 9 cousins and 3 aunts/uncles don&#x27;t know I exist. My grandmother died without knowing I existed. My mother and I have moved 30 times, and I&#x27;ve been doing my best to help provide for our lives.<p>I made the first big mistake of my life and gave up a full scholarship to law school because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to provide for my mother. I dropped out of college after 1 year so she (being at such an old age) could have a decent standard of living, and see her happy for once in her life.<p>Then the second big mistake. I took a massive mortgage and dumped all my savings into this apartment, simply because I knew it was my mother&#x27;s lifelong dream to have a place of her own and move no longer.<p>29 days ago, I made a third big mistake. I quit my full-time web development job, because the PM (who had authority because of the messed up hierarchy of the company) decided I was not 100% committed to the job because I was not pulling 80 hours a week (like nobody else in the company) and did not bother to update my LinkedIn profile while I was there. It was impossible to reason/discuss these things with him, and so I quit. I quit with a massive mortgage and a mother to feed despite knowing full well it would be a bad idea.

Could differences in willingness to violently rob others be construed as saying something about differences in ethics or greed?<p>Of course the second study would never pass the research ethics board, but that&#x27;s okay because, as it turns out, the police keep mountains of such statistics from the natural laboratory social scientists are supposed to be studying.

Whenever I see it, I would mentally say, fuck you, just state your opinion as opinion and don&#x27;t try to twist it around.<p>Back to the blog.  Contrast to the claim, closure for class/module privacy is great because it separates inner implementation from public interface.  I really don&#x27;t want any outside code to touch the private code.  Because tomorrow I might change the inner implementation, function signature, break the function into two pieces, or proxy-call other libraries.  And I want the assurance that the change won&#x27;t break any calling codes.<p>Public function is like global variable.  Anyone can access it anywhere and anytime.  You don&#x27;t know how, where, and when people call it.  If you change its signature, you pretty much have to hunt down every call of it to retrofit.  Private codes have no such issue.  It&#x27;s best to limit the scope of codes that are intended to be private.<p>Testing private code is a non-issue.  Nobody outside cares about your private functions.  They care about your public functions serving as the public interface.  You test your public functions as your users would call them.  Your public functions in turn exercise the private functions.<p>If you really want to test the private functions, write private tests in the same scope as the private functions to call them.",1375126570

Basically, when I&#x27;m hired, I sign a document that says that the company may fire me whenever it feels like it, no questions asked, with 2 weeks notice. During my parents&#x27; generation, you&#x27;d get hired provisionally for a short term contract, and then if they like you you&#x27;d be hired in the longer term (year to 5-year).<p>If this is the kind of loyalty we get from companies these days, then what kind of loyalty do they deserve? At will employment goes both ways, of course. I can quit whenever <i>I</i> want.<p>It&#x27;s also up to an employer to keep their offer competitive. If I have a potentially better deal somewhere else, why shouldn&#x27;t I go there? The default reaction of employers to increasing market salaries is to ignore that fact unless you specifically go ask for a raise or comply with some set of arbitrary rules. How is that a demonstration of goodwill? If you want me to stay, you have to pay me what I&#x27;m worth. If you don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m worth that, but I think I am, why is it surprising that I&#x27;d change jobs? If I succeeded in changing, clearly someone agreed with me.<p>If you want me to stay despite non-stellar salary / benefits, you&#x27;d better have some other benefit such as: a) your product is my baby and I get personal recognition b) good career development & learning opportunities c) a potential to be great.<p>Basically, if you want me to take a chance on you, you have to take a chance on me.",1375125970

What I&#x27;m feeling is that the large majority of students don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s an option. Especially when you move out of CS. I&#x27;ve heard people with great ideas for products who never did anything with them because they had no idea how to. That&#x27;s what we aim to fix. If someone wants to build something, and start a startup, they sure as hell should be able to. Georgia Tech has the resources out there, with VentureLab, ATDC, Flashpoint, etc, but you can&#x27;t keep throwing money and programs at something and expect the culture to change. You need dedicated, motivated students for that.<p>> My advice to undergraduates is thus to build something more difficult than you at first think that you can complete, and write a couple of blog posts about what you have done.<p>I completely agree. It&#x27;s an incredibly rewarding process.<p>> If you instead set out to &quot;learn rails and do a startup&quot;, my prediction is that you&#x27;ll slowly learn that most people talk a big game, web programming is more annoying and complicated than difficult, and making money is hard; all of which I can convince you of in 5 minutes.<p>Everything you say there is completely correct, but I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s a very valuable experience, and you even if/when you fail with that first startup, you come out with a tonne of skills and valuable insight. Maybe the first time around you didn&#x27;t do any customer discovery. The second time around, you&#x27;ll make damn sure there are customers before you build. And really, how many successful startup founders make it the first time. If you&#x27;re going to fail, it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better to fail in college where you have a support network to fall back on, and a backup plan if you absolutely can&#x27;t handle it.",1375124536

In other words,  it becomes easier for many to go elsewhere if they seek greater responsibility, better projects, flexibility (e.g., being able to work remotely full time), equity/salary, to move from SDET or SRE to a pure software engineering role, to get a position at a growing company that would have previously passed on them, and so forth...<p>While I&#x27;m inclined to believe commentators promotion mechanisms on Google&#x27;s technical ladder could be improved (and I am sure this is something Google is working to improve continuously), I don&#x27;t  necessarily think this kind of turnover is unhealthy. If a great person leaves and it&#x27;s apparent to everyone that they&#x27;ve been overlooked and Google <i>should have</i> promoted them <i>before</i> they attempted to resign, it helps show a pattern of what kind of workers are overlooked; if a person leaves and the opposite is true (e.g., they weren&#x27;t performing in a way that warranted a promotion, they weren&#x27;t technically qualified to take on a project of their choice, etc...) then it serves a safety mechanism: those unhappy with their role leave -- meaning the average worker is happier with their role than otherwise.",1375124524

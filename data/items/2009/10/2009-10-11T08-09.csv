874527,comment,874330,874330,0,0,jnaut,,,"First things first:
There are too many checklists out there for telling you what it takes to be an entrepreneur, I am not talking about them.
Do you believe beyond criticism, reason and logic that you have what it takes to be an entreprenreneur??<p>If the answer is yes, read on. Be sure about it or you will regret this.<p>I think a good idea will be to take it slow. A phased migration over a time period of year+.<p>phase1: 
For a few months at the start, maintain a status quo at current job just keep working right, but change your spending, living and saving habits. 
Meanwhile prepare your family for the change, slowly. You have lived too long under the cozy umbrella of constant and guaranteed paycheck at the end of every month, that has to change over to a not so persistent income and amounting only to live well and keep the kids just happy. 
Yes, as someone pointed out, convince and take along your spouse through this transition. Encourage her to take up a job if she is not already doing so.
Save money.<p>phase2:
Save more money :-)
Then move over to part time, at the same organization if they respect your work or some other organization. You can look at freelancing also, but that a different game, you will have to build that image slowly. Consider yourself lucky if you get good gigs at the start, which is not usually the case.
Meanwhile, during this 2nd phase transition, start developing a small fun/serious project  or for open source in your part time.
As Gary[<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhqZ0RU95d4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhqZ0RU95d4</a>] says: work 9-5, come home, spend an hour with the kids and then 7-1 is enough time to do damage. 
Second pointer will be start attending dev and entrepreneur unconferences[barcamp, headstart, etc], speak up, listen, you might make a few friends there who can appreciate what you know and vice versa. Do small weekend hackathons with them, to know them more. Not all weekends, some, spend the rest with the family.
Hopefully one of these friends will be the one you found your first venture with.
Zero on some idea that you are passionate about and a partner who shares the passion and vision. Starting out alone is not usually encouraged, but not ruled out.
Start developing a proof of concept and talk to people about it and get feedback.
Once you are sure that ""this is it"" and you have saved enough money for you and your family for 1year, or your spouse earnings will help in that.<p>phase3:
Get in ramen mode. 
""""""Startup!!""""""<p>Now you are on a complete uncertain rollercoaster. No turning back. Remember this is a result of the ""choice"" you made not something that was forced on you, so persevere and may the luck with you.<p>You can shuffle a few things in the phases. :-)<p>Hope that helps.",1255250482

Pick a problem/domain where if everything else failed you could at least push out a minimal version to see if you can get traction.<p>2. For abandoned projects, salvage the scraps - publish the drafts or parts of them, open-source your code (unless it still holds significant value, but don't overestimate the potential value).<p>3. You seem ambitious and not easily discouraged - both valuable characteristics. So keep trying, but be on the lookout for blind spots, and patterns in your failed projects. Distill your strengths and preferences and see how you can apply them best, and work around your weaknesses.<p>4. Make sure you're not someone else's ""useful idiot"" (and obviously, don't exploit others).<p>5. As others have mentioned here - enjoy your life, seriously! Don't race to the presumed finish line. (Read Philip Greenspun's article on early retirement). You should always strive to pursue something that you find personally meaningful. What's the big picture of what all your efforts are really for? Sitting in a vault of cash by yourself like Scrooge McDuck won't make you happy.<p>6. Unless you want to become an academic or consultant/i-banker, don't worry too much about your GPA, but meet <i>and work with</i> as many people as possible. Make friends and test-drive them for productive pursuits. College (and I guess grad school) are statistically almost the last stops for finding co-founders.

In the 60s, they thought 4 billion bytes would be much more than they would ever need, but 32 bit's headroom was just 1000 times more than the biggest they used in that day (assuming 4MB, even though IBM's System/360 could access 8MB, which in that case the headroom would only be 500 times as much memory).  64 bit tops out at about 17.2 billion GB, and if we estimate that today's common RAM size is 2GB, the headroom we have for 64 bit is about 8.6 billion times what most computers have commonly today.  That means that the headroom for 64 bit is 8.6 MILLION times the headroom that was in 32-bit.

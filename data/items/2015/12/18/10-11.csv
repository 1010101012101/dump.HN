Human rights are ideals, not actual things.<p>Regardless, the real point is that property rights trump free speech rights.

And I&#x27;m pretty sure the UN DoHR says the same thing.<p>And further, given the leftist thing that it is, I&#x27;d bet dollars to donuts that the UN DoHR also says people have the right not to be on the receiving end of speech that incites violence towards them, a.k.a. hate speech.

So when I search for something in my country and spelling of that something is the same with not what I am looking for completely on the other side of the globe, DDG becomes completely useless.<p>Now, I know, DDG can specify where I am (or I can tell it), but the thing is that it still does not work, as I expect.<p>Also DDG does not work as well (as Google) with some words/terms (e.g. python - snake/programming language). When I am browsing google will know that by `python` I mean programming language, and when my sister browses it means snake.<p>Maybe you are right, that later it would do better, but for now DDG just does not cut it, and I have been trying to use it for probably 4 years.

The DSP and openGL parts aren&#x27;t too bad, but hacking together non-trivial event and data processing logic can be torturous.<p>This is the big problem with dataflow - it makes you keep switching mental modes from visual object recognition to spatial understanding to text parsing/editing to causal modelling to UI design.<p>Text has its own issues, but it lets you stay in one mode.<p>I think VB and Delphi had a lot of success because they hit a sweet spot between the two. They let you solve visual and UI problems visually, and logic problems with code.<p>Webspace still doesn&#x27;t have an exact equivalent.

We don&#x27;t always have the time to properly get to the bottom of things, assuming all of us are even capable of doing so, so we&#x27;re going to grasp for salient categories anyways.<p>It vaguely reminds me of the discussions here about functional programming versus object-oriented programming. Alongside the heated debate for and against either approach (and the definitions of the &#x27;true&#x27; version of each), there&#x27;s always someone who points out something like &#x27;closures are just a poor man&#x27;s objects&#x27;, and &#x27;objects are just a poor man&#x27;s closures&#x27;.<p>Even if, for the sake of argument, the differences between FP and OP are not as fundamental or clear-cut as they seem, I&#x27;d argue that for me and many others these discussions are very useful. I&#x27;d never get out of my &#x27;OOP box&#x27; to explore FP if it wasn&#x27;t contrasted and put in a whole separate category and given a bunch of tantalizing pros that pull me to investigate.<p>Isn&#x27;t &#x27;truth&#x27; really just another abstraction, but one we cannot (yet) dive into to find the underlying &#x27;truth&#x27;? What I mean is, we stop at a certain point not only because it&#x27;s where we end up at for the time being, but also because it&#x27;s a useful abstraction.<p>And to be clear, I&#x27;m arguing this primarily in the context of the already very murky and messy field of the social sciences / psychology, where definitions are a lot less definitive than in physics or mathematics, and where they have a much more immediate effect on society.<p>(honestly, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m disagreeing with you, and I&#x27;m sorry if I&#x27;m perhaps not making much sense.

I came from eBay, where neither of the three components were anywhere near what they are today. Also realize that he was in IT, where salaries have never been that good.<p>> Still wouldn&#x27;t have been able to buy a Bay Area house (not sure why you suggest it could),<p>I didn&#x27;t say &#x27;buy&#x27;. Just down payment.<p>> but he would have had all of the other payouts you listed, with basically no downside risk at all.<p>I prefer to define &quot;downside&quot; with not just money, but with the whole experience. Defining upside/downside with money builds mercenaries; not missionaries. And in a startup, whatever level one gets in, one should be the latter. If you can&#x27;t be one, then IBM is a better place to be and to stay at.<p>If you are primarily focused on monetary payout, you won&#x27;t be able to do the best work of your life, which is an opportunity a fast-growing organization provides, which nobody else can. And when a 1000 people do the best work of their life, everyone invariably gets rewarded.<p>At that point, 350K or 500K doesn&#x27;t matter. What matters, is that you&#x27;ve spent 4 years of your life with incredible people doing incredible work. That will always open far more doors than it&#x27;ll close.<p>> Seems like pre-IPO companies like Box are increasingly a bad deal for the employees. I&#x27;m genuinely sorry you guys ended up getting the short end of that stick.<p>That&#x27;s the point. We didn&#x27;t get the short end :-) Even Sutton says, that overall he is fine. Because he too, understands that it&#x27;s about the whole experience and the future credibility. He is just ranting about one piece - viz. mismatched monetary expectations and doesn&#x27;t want us to generalize.",1450434929

It seems to me that humans use logic in some situations and lower level features in others, or maybe both to some degree.<p>For instance, imagine a view from a car onto a dark country road ahead, lined with trees. The road bends so you can&#x27;t see around the corner, but you see a light getting brighter. Humans would conclude that there must be an oncoming car and they would focus on where exactly the headlights appear relative to the middle of the road.<p>Nothing else in the picture would matter much. The one thing that does matter cannot be concluded from the picture itself. So humans can compress that image as two points (the headlights) and the a line that represents the middle of the road. Pretty good dimensionality reduction I would say.<p>Machine learning systems can obviously be trained to do something very similar. But my point is that if you take away the situational context necessary for focus, what&#x27;s left may not tell us much about how humans process images in most cases.<p>Also, how many examples of car crashes does a machine learning system need in order to recognise where the headlights should definitely not be? How many head-on car crashes do humans need in order to learn from their mistakes? But that&#x27;s a wholly different subject.<p>Please don&#x27;t take this as a criticism of the paper. I haven&#x27;t (fully) read it and I know next to nothing about random projection. I&#x27;m just generally wondering about how lower level features and high level reasoning are interconnected.

Very often I see the pattern of the project contributors losing control over the dynamic language project. They slip up, the tests become insufficient and now they refuse / are afraid to touch critical parts of the code. Soon development slows down to a crawl. Or rather, there are no more changes - only additions / grafts to the existing codebase.<p>When I first started using TypeScript, I feared that I&#x27;m going to lose the benefits of a dynamic language and that I&#x27;ll have to write a lot more boilerplate. I had no idea how little of that was true. TypeScript really goes out of its way to model as many JS idioms as possible, including some really dynamic ones:<p><pre><code>  * Structural types are formalized duck type checking. You don&#x27;t \n    have to say your object implements an interface: if it has all \n    the right fields, and they&#x27;re of the right type, it does. This is \n    similar to Go interfaces (but a bit more powerful in what it can express).\n  * Unions types plus type guards can model dynamic function arguments\n  * Intersection types can model record (object) merging\n</code></pre>\nThe entire type system in TypeScript is basically a formalization of the typical duck typing patterns that are common in JavaScript. As a result, TypeScript can model almost any common JS idiom. The loss of expresivity was very minimal - maybe 1% of the most dynamic code only. And even there, you can tell the type system &quot;I know what I&#x27;m doing&quot; (cast to `any`), turn it off, do your dynamic stuff and then tell it the resulting types (cast to whatever types are the result before returning).<p>Given the above, theres been absolutely no doubt in my mind whether TypeScript gave us an edge or not. Its been incomparably better than just plain JS.",1450433903

As long as standard no-damage rules are followed, where&#x27;s the problem?<p>The bug bounty program is working exactly as intended, but the researcher is getting dinged over arbitrary rules. As somebody else here mentioned already: the reason blackhat work still pays, is because such arbitrary and bureaucratic rules <i>do not exist there</i>.<p>We should not forget that bug bounties are a tool, not a goal - the goal is to convince researchers to report rather than sell, and <i>every</i> part of a bug bounty and its rules must be designed accordingly.<p>Also: Why the hell were those AWS credentials not revoked immediately after compromise? This constitutes a grossly negligent failure on Facebook&#x27;s part to assess impact, <i>on top</i> of their existing failure to have the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot; on a single server to begin with.<p>And frankly, that failure only reinforces the need for the researcher pivoting into further systems, rather than just keeping it to a PoC - because evidently, <i>nobody</i> is going to assess impact at Facebook, if the researcher doesn&#x27;t do it himself.",1450433698

10757655,comment,10749809,10756711,0,0,hawski,,,"I would say that union file systems. Recently overlayfs got merged. It doesn&#x27;t work like Plan9&#x27;s, but it is probably impossible within POSIX constrains. You probably shouldn&#x27;t use overlayfs to merge /bin directories so you could get rid of PATH as it is the case in Plan9.<p>Interesting thing is missing mmap in Plan9. Aside other things it makes most programs work with remote files quite easily. There is no separate path for local and remote files, because either way you have to read/write to them. That also makes local access slower than it can be, but that is the price for network transparency. You can hammer mmap to work with remote files, but it may have too many corner cases. That&#x27;s at least how I understand it. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.",1450433296

It would be great to get urban street speed limits lowered to max out at 25–30 mph everywhere, with strict enforcement against driving above 35–40mph. In collisions between cars and pedestrians or cyclists, everyone mostly walks away alive at 25 mph, whereas at 45+ mph the pedestrian or cyclist dies almost every time.<p>With smarter road design organized to minimize waits at traffic signals, it wouldn’t even necessarily result in slower trips or less road capacity overall.",1450433188

Connect &quot;and&quot; object to door&#x27;s &quot;open&quot; input. If all 3 switches are pressed door opens.<p>But scripting anything more complex and especially user interfaces is awful. The designers will back themselves into all kinds of corners and there will be all kinds of edge cases not handled and subtle bugs and tracking them down is very very hard.<p>There was one company started by x-Insomniac people IIRC that decided there should be no designers scripting. All scripting should be done by programmers. Their experience was that trying to make programming easier for non-programmers sounds great, and it is for introducing people to programming concepts and enabling them to make things, but when it comes to shipping code it&#x27;s not great and too much time is spent dealing with the mess of spaghetti they make.<p>Note I&#x27;m not harshly judging designers here. Great designers make great design. I&#x27;m only saying that experienced programmers are more likely to write efficient, maintainable, bug free code than non-programmers.",1450433169

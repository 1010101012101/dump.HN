Depending on the size of those personal projects, they may be unrealistic to achieve given certain time-frames.<p>Starting a successful software company is hard.  Building one that sustains you and grows 10% ARR is hard, building one that grows 5% MRR is much much harder.  Starting a software company--unless you stumble upon it--is NOT a side project.<p>The Longfellow poem resonated with me as well, but what I&#x27;ve come to realize is that the source of my happiness has shifted.  Rather than focusing on the things that make ME happy, I prefer--and like--to focus on the things that make members of my family happy.  This in turn, brings me (more) happiness.<p>Being my own boss was something I wanted to focus on.  I&#x27;m VERY fortunate to be able to live in the SF Bay Area and have a spouse that earns enough so I can work on running my own business.  There is no way my company would be where it is now if it were a side project.  It required full-time(+plus) dedication to get it up and running, and now rolling.<p>I do look back and realize there are (literal) mountains I have not climbed or cars I have not bought, but if my kids can have happier and better lives, that&#x27;s what I want more than anything else, and taking steps to that end bring me contentment.",1452146358

Since that isn&#x27;t remotely possible, we might as well throw our hands up in the air. And forget about data, it&#x27;s not at fault here.<p>Like you, Snowden&#x27;s freedom of speech line never impacted me... until I read this article. It suddenly hit me. The reason I was missing his point is because I was framing it in terms of what&#x27;s in it for me rather than looking at it as what&#x27;s in it for us. Someone who doesn&#x27;t care about freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t care because he doesn&#x27;t see what&#x27;s in it for him. But I doubt you&#x27;d argue the benefits of the first amendment.<p>Similarly, privacy is very important. You might not care (even though you really do), but defending privacy is about ensuring security. Privacy is important for all of us, just like freedom of speech is.<p>As for what the actual problem is, the problem for the most part is ignorance and a failure to quench it. We need more privacy / cyber-security advocates who can educate people on why they ought to care. It&#x27;s like teaching people why it&#x27;s important to lock their doors at night or why they should put their letters into envelopes instead of just using post cards. It&#x27;s why my mom had to drill into my brain the importance of not giving out my social security number willy nilly. Are you so liberal with your SSN? You don&#x27;t care about privacy, so would it bother you if Facebook or Google asked for it. After all, they just want to make sure you are who you say you are.<p>Things aren&#x27;t obvious to us until they&#x27;re obvious, and then it feels like common sense. DUH, lock your door!

10856209,comment,10847943,10850618,0,0,StevePerkins,,,"I&#x27;ve been working professionally with Java for 19 years.  I&#x27;ve only worked &quot;semi-professionally&quot; with Go for 3 or 4 years, as a secondary language for a few niche applications at work and some personal projects at home.  So I may or may not be the most qualified person in the world to represent Go here.<p>All that being said, the longer I work with Go, the less I really see its lack of generics as a significant shortcoming.  Go simply doesn&#x27;t emphasize object-orientation to the same degree as idiomatic Java.  Given the choice, I&#x27;d prefer to have that tool available than not have it.  However, I haven&#x27;t yet personally run across a real-world scenario in which lack of generics was an actual big deal.<p>I am QUITE comfortable in asserting that Go&#x27;s error handling exceeds that of Java&#x27;s, not lags it.  The &quot;try-catch&quot; concept is still there (as &quot;panic-recover&quot;), albeit discouraged in many of the cases that an experienced Java developer would want to use it.  The convention of having every function return a possible error struct, and the compiler&#x27;s insistence that you do something with that that returned struct, pushes Go developers into a much more disciplined mindset of approaching exception handling.<p>The two points above are subjective, of course.  Reasonable people could argue them either way.  The third response is a bit more objective.  Regarding the notion that Go is &quot;<i>absolutely not designed for Android</i>&quot; and its memory constraints, I must point out that neither is Java!  As a matter of the Java language&#x27;s syntactical suitability, the obvious observation is that Java PRE-DATES Android by more than 12 years.  Considering the laws of physics and space-time, it was clearly not designed by James Gosling with Google&#x27;s OS in mind.  Secondly, the memory constraints of carrying a built-in garbage collection runtime also apply to Java.  The only difference is a matter of maturity, and the level of resources that have gone into developing a custom Java solution for Android.  There&#x27;s no reason why Google couldn&#x27;t do the some with Go (or almost any other language), and given Go&#x27;s comparative simplicity it would probably take far less time to get there.",1452145288
10856208,comment,10850205,10856117,0,0,orblivion,,,"I&#x27;ve never actually used such a feature, but my understanding is that this is not strictly true. I think that the compiler can generically understand that this function adds two vectors and their lengths.<p>I&#x27;ll see if I can contrive an example. Supposing you have a list L1 of vectors of length 5. You also have a vector V1 with user input, with length x (unknown at compile time). You then make a new list L2 by taking each vector in L1 and append V1 to it. L2 is now a list of vectors of length (5 + x). Even though x is unknown at compile time, the compiler still knows that all vectors in L2 are of the same length. It can make restrictions based on this fact.<p>It seemed strange to me when I heard this concept, I thought the compiler would need to consider infinite possibilities, but apparently similar things are possible even in Haskell. For instance, you can define a list as a recursive type that holds a value of a Null <i>type</i> (not just a null value of the list type) or another List. Apparently it can still reason about this.<p>However, these are things I&#x27;ve heard. Hopefully someone with more experience can chime in and let me know if I&#x27;m right here.",1452145257

First-class modules are syntactic sugar over System F-omega, which means that the elaboration/type-checking phase of 1ML duly splits modules into type and value components, which live in separate worlds.<p>Personally, I find 1ML&#x27;s approach more pragmatic, or, at least, easier to digest for most programmers - including Haskell programmers. Dependent types are more powerful, but they aren&#x27;t free from complications. For instance, unifying the type and value languages willy-nilly can cause trouble if you want your value language to be Turing-complete, because now type-level computation can diverge too! In a language based on System F-omega, type-level computation is guaranteed not to diverge, because its type level is the simply typed lambda calculus. Some use cases might warrant providing more powerful type-level computation facilities (e.g. calculating the shapes of multidimensional matrices), but it isn&#x27;t clear to me that the full power of a Martin-Loef-style dependent type theory is needed.",1452145147

(by far the most important) They trivialize the recovery of indentation that has been trashed by a bad/misconfigured/unfamiliar editor or coworker who inserted &quot;\t&quot; characters into the file. Just run indent-region or send the file through indent(1).<p>2. Moving code is easier. Just kill/yank it to where you want it and let indent-region or whatever re-indent as needed. Without delimiters I have to either re-indent manually or use an editor with a feature that changes a region&#x27;s indent level. Even with such a feature, I still have to tell the editor &quot;move this two levels deeper&quot;. With delimiters, I can leave that work to the editor.<p>3. The movement advantages you mentioned.<p>As for the extra work of having to close blocks (including the infamous LISP &quot;)))))&quot; motif), that&#x27;s what features like electric-pair-mode is for.<p>Even better, delimiters can convey more information. Color cues have proven to be very effective at conveying important information; syntax highlighting is very popular, even when showing code outside an editor (such as inside a <pre> tag). I find extending these color cues to also show nesting[1] to be almost as useful as basic syntax highlighting.

Those who panic most and sell soonest might get a better price than those who take the time to find out the truth, providing a potentially serious financial motivation to panic.

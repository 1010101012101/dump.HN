The problem is that once you enter the password to make a purchase (even of a free app), you stay logged in for a while (15 minutes?). A lot of parents have been burned by downloading a free app (requiring a login), then handing their phone to their kid to entertain them for a few minutes. The kid then racks up a few in-app purchases before the login session times out. Quite a few parents learn that lesson when their kid buys a $1.99 add-on, but the really scummy apps have $99 purchases.<p>I generally wouldn't worry about it. If the device is for a kid, they'll probably be begging for iTunes gift cards and will learn to budget their purchases. The only real problem is when mom or dad have their iTunes account tied to their credit / debit card and don't pay attention.",1331564383

At least not the Consumer Preview.<p>And that workflow only works for the very first person to use the system.  It's defeated in any situation where you've got multiple people sharing a computer, and all using the same account. (i.e., <i>normal computer usage patterns</i>.) It's also defeated in any situation where the user dismisses the tour without even looking at it first.  (i.e., <i>normal computer usage patterns</i>.)  What they actually need to have Win8 do is automatically detect if it's running on a standard PC, and if so then have it default to the kind of user interface that PC users have been used to for the past 17 years.<p>I suspect that Metro is a great interface for tablets, and I could see even making it very easy to get to from PCs, for users who like it.  But making it the default for PCs will be a dangerous and stupid move my Microsoft if they decide to stick with it.  It's not just that it'll be confusing to users.  It'll be that it's sacrificing the single biggest thing which ensures their continuing dominance in the PC market - familiarity.  The interface on Win8 CP manages to be different enough from previous versions of Windows that it <i>will</i> feel more alien to their customers than the OS of their primary competitor, Apple.  The last thing Microsoft needs to be doing right now is accelerating the rate at which Apple takes their customers by voluntarily jettisoning the primary reason why many of their users haven't switched yet.<p><i>it's clear from the video that switching back to Metro with the mouse is non-obvious.</i><p>And how.  ""Non-obvious"" is like the official slogan of Windows 8. It's amazing how many things are non-obvious on Win8 consumer preview.  When I first tried it (having not tried developer preview first), I found myself at a loss the first time I tried to find the control panel, get to the desktop, open IE in a Window (that is, get the non-Metro browser), get back to the Start screen from the desktop, close a Metro app, switch Metro apps, shut the computer down, open an application that isn't on the start screen (e.g., cmd.exe), add an app to the start screen. . . All of this might have been easy enough to figure out, except that I was sitting there looking at an OS named ""Windows 8"", so I kept (perhaps foolishly) expecting it to behave somewhat like the one named ""Windows 7"".<p>Long story short, Windows 8 is the first operating system since Unix where I felt the need to keep some sort of instruction manual close at hand while I was getting used to it.  Even Unity felt less jarring to me.",1331563977

Kids are smart, they expect that when they click a button, something should happen. If it takes over 250ms, my kid thinks it's broke and will start clicking it repeatedly.<p>2) Always use ""onTouchDown"" instead of ""onTouchUp"" when handling simple presses. 
My kid doesn't always release his finger after touching a button and when nothing happens, he thinks he needs to touch the button repeatedly. If the developers targeted the ""Touch Down"" event instead of ""Touch Up"" my kid wouldn't have learned this behavior.",1331563958

They offered significantly more storage and were also a bit more robust (except when they got scratched). However, copying data to them was no longer a simple matter of `copy c:\foo.txt d:\`.

If they've done the work already, and you're building beyond what the other person did, then it saves you time and money to copy the code. By copying it, you allow yourself to devote your energies toward providing a higher-quality product, which in itself is a worthy goal, but at what cost?<p>2. Copying someone is wrong. Because they did the work, I feel that they earned the right to control where that work is used and who it is used by. Obviously, code that is open source is fair game, but to straight up copy somebody else's source code is unethical.<p>The way I see it, if you're going to copy someone, just ask them for permission!

There is no clean cut, no mode switch.<p>I understand the abstract principle behind it, but that does not help.<p>Two examples I noticed when fooling around with it. Nothing major, but they illustrate the problem very well. This is using a default and clean install of the consumer preview:<p>So you boot it up and are presented with a big image that displays the time and nothing else. Clicking just makes the image hop, you actually have to swipe upwards (with the mouse!) to be allowed to log in.<p>You see this PDF in the Explorer and double click it. A Metro app launches and removes all UI elements you just saw and are used to. There is no way to close it on screen, nowhere to click to get out of it. You have to know about the hot corners or keyboard shortcuts to get out of it. Even then: Its a jarring transition between two completely different UI paradigms. That is no fun even if you know how to get out of it, even if you know that its supposed to be that way.<p>All of this would be fine if normal Windows apps were on their way out. If we all were to ditch our mice. If the Desktop were only there for compatibility reasons, to run those old apps no one is going to use in a year or two anyway. Only, even Microsoft doesnt seem to be on that path. It looks like Office will not be a Metro app, for example.<p>I dont want to see Windows 8 fail. Metro is incredibly cool for tablets and phones. (Windows 7 also was incredibly great  for Windows  as a desktop OS. It works really well.) Its really awesome! But Im not sure about the Metro and old Windows UI hodgepodge. I just cant convince myself that touch interfaces work well with the mouse. Its just not fun to swipe with a mouse. And interfaces which are fun to use with swipes and taps are not necessarily fun to use with a mouse. (The reverse is obviously also true.) All the Metro apps seem like incredibly cool tablet apps. I can see that I would have a lot of fun with them on my iPad. The Store is also cool and very well integrated. But with a mouse? In such a leaky environment? Where the mouse user is confronted with touch interfaces over and over?<p>What Microsoft is doing is incredibly brave. That alone deserves recognition. But I really cant see it succeeding.

Since I already use my valid Win7 key on my desktop I dropped on a VirtualBox installation over my linux and put in the Win8 Consumer preview.<p>Holy hell.<p>The start button was the first thing> I landed my self on the desktop (because fuck Metro) and quickly realized I have no idea how I can actually do anything. Virtual Box wasn't capturing my Windows Key entries as they were being nabbed by my Linux OS so I was S.O.L. there but it should not be this frustrating to actually use an OS to install Visual Studio + Libraries + FF.<p>At this point I'm willing to axe that Virtual OS and just dual boot with a Win7 copy that sits on the ""you have 30 days to activate"" B.S. before axing it next Monday.<p>The thing is that Microsoft is going the way of thinking ""the average user no longer requires a desktop."" I tend to agree, the content creators - whether they're programmers or artists - are the ones who require a fully operational OS. Those who simply consume the content are well off with smart devices which Metro was designed for. But these two worlds are DIFFERENT. I <i>need</i> the ability to dig through the internals of my OS. I <i>need</i> the ability to work with my system registry, services, administrative options and everything else mixed in.

[is] far better than what's available on Windows at the moment</i><p>I agree on this, though not everything that can or should be installed on Ubuntu comes through the Software Center or even as a .deb or apt repo. For things outside of this, a .exe file on Windows has the upper hand. .exe (or .msi) is a Windows universal. .deb and .rpm are not Linux universals.<p>><i>Installers can block each other on Windows as well. This point just seems like nit-picking.</i><p>And it's frustrating. You will notice I said ""it has to be better than 'better than Windows'"", because ""better than Windows"" still means ""learning something other than Windows"".<p>I use Ubuntu. I like it.

I have the stats, but given that the <i>vast</i> majority of open source projects (Google or otherwise) don't ever grow past a few people, I don't see why it would be relevant?  I also don't see why it's relevant whether they work for Google or not.   It's not like we require projects follow a different process for Googler committers vs non, so i don't see how it's any different from a project where the committers are all really good friends who work on an OSS project together.  We also hire a lot of committers to our open source projects.  I'm guessing you want to make a distinction between ""corporate open source projects"", and ""non-corporate open source projects"", but in reality, making such a distinction would be a mistake, because the typical differences are in policies and preferences, and they apply equally well to either.  IE What matters is the policies the project applies to committers and contributors, not whether they all work for the same company.<p>3. Again, I have stats, but for the vast majority of open source projects, just because most are willing to accept them, doesn't mean anyone ever contributes.  This has nothing to do with Google, of course.  If you look at the hundreds of thousands of projects on say, sourceforge, you will find the number that have either at least one not-same-email-domain-as-owner committer or non-trivial LOC written by a not-same-email-domain-as-owner committer else is quite low.<p>4. This seems to be a governance and social issue, I don't track it formally, as it would be quite difficult to do so.
It would also be wrong for us to try to force a model on folks.  We give folksinfo about what we thinks are best practices, and in fact, free copies of the producing OSS book (Karl used to work with us :P), how they run their projects is generally up to them.  We are happy to give them advise when asked, and are happy to consult in general.",1331561052

You get funding from multiple angels or VCs so a number can compete.

You can see Apple bet on this fact with its acquisition of Chomp recently.<p>Even more broadly, there are too many players in the mobile app ecosystem who are searching for ways to help app marketers get distribution through various paid means, but not enough (virtually none) who are searching for ways to help app marketers get distribution through organic (unpaid) means. Yet this is exactly where the vast majority of downloads come from.<p>We want to focus on the organic side of app distribution: search, rankings, social/sharing, earned media, web landing pages, etc. All things that help app marketers promote their apps without paying per download.

The revolutionary application will make playing ""what if"" a low friction exercise with a high degree of accuracy while accounting for the wide range of comfort levels with technology among people who actually build stuff. The 37signals paradigm comes to mind.<p>The tough problem is not replacing printed sets of plans, construction takes time and success comes from avoiding the sorts of crises depicted in the article through planning and information management - at the point the crane cannot swing 30kips of concrete into place due to lack of clearance, one is trying to minimize losses not maximize profits.<p>The focus on the iPad is allowing the team to address the non-critical problem paper plans present for construction professionals traveling between jobsites rather than the tackling the critical path impediments to radical change.<p>That critical path requires dealing with BIM. On the other hand, BIM is information modeling not 3D virtual construction. 3D is for solving design issues (and impressing lay people).<p>The representation of that information does not need to be 3D for most construction management purposes - i.e. answering the questions of how many, who can do it, when can they do it, and how much will it cost in terms of budget and schedule.<p>Except for trivial cases or those involving very close established working relationships, those questions are answered in days, not the length of time one is standing next to a trench with a broken sewer main.<p>Young guns shooting aggressively from the hip at design professionals during a crisis is not revolutionary, even if an iPad is involved.<p>AutoCad changed the industry because it lowered the cost of technology into the $10k range - $40 retail boxes of homeowner design software didn't even though they were a profitable product.<p>The revolutionary product for the construction industry utilizes business intelligence to better manage project timelines and budgets while weighing the impact on working relationships among the various parties in a way which minimizes uncertainty.",1331560852

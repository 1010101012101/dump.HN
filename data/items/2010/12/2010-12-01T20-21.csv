I think many rationals problem is that they don't interact enough and then use their positive social interactions to social proof their bad ones.<p>Consider his first scenario where the person puts up his hand and says that they don't have the budget to do that.
The speaker might indeed be mad and likewise some others in the room.
Invariably there would be someone there that likes your outspoken or directness[just by the share number of people in the room, probability dictates it].<p>Now, if our rational guy stands there by himself and refuses to interact with others, the speaker and his allies will brand him as rude.  Every move he makes, no matter how trivial would only be seen in this light.<p>If he had started interacting until he found someone who likes his disposition, he is then social proof by that person. Then he begins to climb a ladder of social proof. He would meet someone else who because that one person liked him they would like him too, and you can see how this spreads exponentially.  Now, it would be just the speaker left hating him; well no actually, the speaker will now think his evaluation of the situation was previously wrong and that the guy is alright.[Appropriate reading: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments</a>]<p>And if our rationalist is lucky he can turn his new found social proof into Authority by running for some prestigious position such as president.  At which point, people will like him cause he is in that given position.<p>Being nice has it's only problems also. For instance, people would assume you want something from them if you start acting nice the first time you meet them.<p>Again, social proof can over come this problem of being suspecting of wanting something.<p>Social proofing can lead to what I call, the lovable Jerk. People who act in a way that undermines others but the general populous loves them so they are forgiven time and time again.<p>With that said let, me sum up my points.  Being social proof will lead to people liking you but as a rational you only have a few people who naturally like you but you need to build from those few.[Appropriate viewing: Derek Sivers - How to start a movement <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74AxCqOTvg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74AxCqOTvg</a> ]",1291236824

It also ties in to why the airlines want you to show proof of who you are.<p>Back before they did both of these it was common for people to buy round trips and sell the legs individually for well below what the airline was willing to sell them for.<p>Why, you ask?  The fundamental problem is that airline pricing is insanely complicated.  The principle is simple, put a plane in the air, fill it with passengers, try to make a profit.  The problem is that there are huge fixed costs to having the flight (time on airplane, fuel, employees, airport fees) and much lower variable costs (incremental cost of baggage, incremental fuel).  Only a small fraction of people are willing to pay their share of the true cost of the flight.  Some of those are willing to pay much more.  Most are willing to pay less than their share of the total costs (not worth having the flight for them) but more than the marginal cost (worth letting them on the flight).<p>The result is that airline pricing becomes all about pushing people who are able to pay more into actually paying more, while allowing people who are not willing to pay more to get on cheaply.  For instance if someone does a round trip and has a layover that includes a weekend, that's probably not a business trip and so they can pay less.  Someone who flies somewhere then flies back the next day is probably on a business trip and can be charged more.<p>One way trips are generally bought by someone who is going A to B to C ... because those are business stops.  People flying on business are generally willing to charge more, so airlines happily charge them more.",1291236518

They're mainly transit airlines, but to fly from e.g. random US to Australia, it's probably cheaper to go via the middle east on one of those carriers vs. over the Pacific.  There are a lot of political concerns in places like Canada that the middle eastern airlines are dropping prices so low on profitable long-haul routes that the national flag carriers can't compete.<p>As to why they are better, it's probably that they focus on the inherently profitable long haul high capacity high frequency market, have little or no ""legacy"" costs (US carriers paying pensions and healthcare for retirees), supportive governments (for things like expanding their hub/transit airports to accommodate more flights).  Allegedly they are not massively subsidized by the foreign governments.",1291236346

1959510,comment,1958739,1958739,0,0,dramage,,,"Thanks for the feedback, folks.  I'm actually a bit surprised this hit hacker news without any of us authors posting it, but heck, I'll jump in.<p>Think of this as an experiment in exploring a document collection at a higher level than search.  Specifically, what you're seeing is Stanford's dissertations through the lens of a text model that tries to distill high-level patterns in the data.  It doesn't always succeed, but it often hits the mark.  There are plenty of ways that the visualization and the underlying text model could be improved.<p>For the curious, I'll tell you a bit more on how the numbers are computed: we build a unigram language model of the contents of every Stanford department based on their dissertations.  Then, we posit that every dissertation comes from a mixture of those department models (using a supervised topic model, Labeled LDA).  This lets us infer, for every dissertation, a weighted mixture of departments that best characterizes that abstract.  So, say, dissertation X is 60% computer science, 20% physics, and so on.  These scores are aggregated to compute the average similarities between departments, and are sliced to give the view over time.<p>So what you're looking at is, essentially, a visualization of word overlap between departments measured by letting the dissertations in one department borrow from words from another department.  Which departments borrow the most words from which others?<p>When you zoom in two-levels (click on a department twice), individual dissertations are plotted on a line between each dissertation's home department and it's next highest scoring department.  So the relative position of two dissertations near each other is not meaningful unless they are on the same radial line.  Dissertations from other departments that have a high score for the central, focused department, are also shown.<p>For instance, take a look at Computer Science in 2005.  You'll see three dissertations along the radial line to Linguistics - those are the three students that graduated from the Stanford NLP group that year.  There are plenty of other places you find similar things that work, and also places where things don't work as nicely as you'd expect.<p>The visualization Jason built was really interesting from the text modeling perspective, because it let us experiment with many model variations (lda, tf-idf, etc etc) to see how well each matched our intuitions.  This model, though still wanting, was by far the best.  Good enough, even, for us to put online for the world to play with, and for hacker news to pick apart ;)",1291236258

The OP could have saved himself a lot of trouble by simply calling United before he left and canceling his departure.<p>After mulling it over, my second thought was that air travel is a BIG DEAL to most people -- it's stressful and expensive, and the rules are opaque.  I agree that United could have made this MUCH better by sending the OP a notice within, say, 12 hours of missing his first flight explaining the situation and his future options.<p>Straying from the customer experience, on a systems side, airline yield management is a TERRIFIC problem to think about.

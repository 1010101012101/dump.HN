It&#x27;s pretty easy to hack to build other profiles as you just need to make an erb.<p>Base16 is organized in pretty much the same way as Solarized colours, so if you have gotten used to Solarized and just want to adjust the colours to something easier to see (I suffer from the same problem you do), then I think it is the way to go.<p>I hesitate to mention this because it isn&#x27;t quite ready yet, but where I work we do a <i>lot</i> of remote pair programming over tmux.  The problem is that everybody has their own idea of what colours look good.  My buddy and I made a vim colorscheme that looks reasonable with many different palettes, called agnostic: <a href=""https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/agnostic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/agnostic</a><p>So if you ever need to pair program over tmux and one person wants a light background, but another person wants a dark backgroun, you can do it it.  If you do that kind of thing a lot, then I recommend working with agnostic.  Otherwise I think Base16 is probably the way to go.",1435651138

9803649,comment,9798374,9803021,0,0,AdieuToLogic,,,"I guess I need to elaborate on this answer.<p>Perhaps our observations are a result of existing within two gravitational space-time distortions, one trivial and one not.  The trivial one being the Sun and the non-trivial being the galaxy which we inhabit.<p>If curvature of space-time theorized by General Relativity is accepted, then observing non-local energy will be affected by gravity in which the observation is being undertaken.  Accounting for the Sun&#x27;s influence has largely (if not completely) been addressed, but there lies a more difficult &quot;elephant in the room&quot; problem of determining what effect the gravitational curvature of the Milky Way has on <i>any</i> observations we can make.<p>According to the University of Oregon[1], the observable mass of the Milky Way is 200,000,000,000 Solar masses.  The same material indicates that visible stars account for 30% of that.  Throw in a bit for singularities and lets call it &quot;less than 50%&quot; for the sake of discussion.  In any event, there exists enough mass in this galaxy to plausibly state that the space-time we inhabit is affected.  Yet a non-trivial amount considered &quot;unaccounted for.&quot;<p>Using the canonical 3d inverse-cone visualization of matter&#x27;s effect on space-time, imagine our solar system exists on some point within the galaxy&#x27;s gravitational cone yet not near its center.  Making intra-galactic calculations may be influenced by compressed space-time instead of the presence of dark matter.  And observations regarding other galaxies colliding (as mentioned in the article) migth be explained by gravitational phase shifting.<p>Though all of this likely will be rebuked, it is why I originally said &quot;sure.&quot;<p>1 - <a href=""http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~imamura/123cs/lecture-2/mass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~imamura/123cs/lecture-2/mass.ht...</a>",1435651072

9803644,comment,9803043,9803530,0,0,colechristensen,,,"A big reason for the huge price tag and many delays has to do with the very broken military acquisition process.  It&#x27;s a mess, a huge problem that not many people have much insight into and fewer posses the real motivation and capability to change.<p>You can make a fairly valid parallel can be made with web designers and bad clients.  You start off with a clear goal and reasonable costs and deliverables, and through iteration after iteration of needless revisions, terrible requests, and changed requirements you end up with a clown hat, a fart button, all in comic sans at 10x the original estimate.<p>---<p>Nobody wants to dogfight – the F-35 wasn&#x27;t designed for it and modern strategy has nothing to do with it.  You destroy the enemy with smart missiles long before either of you sees the other – F35 stealth is designed to delay detection as long as possible. This report takes the test completely out of context.  It wasn&#x27;t a wargame between A and B, it was a very specific situation under severe restrictions used to test the boundaries of the F-35&#x27;s role.  A real wargame would end with both sides never getting within miles. Not understanding the context of why the test was done leads to real misunderstanding.<p>----<p>As for drones - it is true they have a huge future, but they aren&#x27;t the only solution.  Modern air superiority battles are as much about stealth and electronic warfare as anything else.  If your entire enemy is remote-controlled robots, your real target becomes the communications.  There is very real value to having a human in the theater of battle – many of the strengths of the F-35 revolve around it as a platform for the interaction of many different communications, intelligence, and weapons assets ... the pilot is the command and control center for a whole network of activity which is much more resilient than remote control satellite RC planes and missiles.<p>Dog fighting only happens when absolutely everything else fails and both sides can bring each other into the stone age of point-and-shoot flying.<p>---<p>In a real war with a competent enemy, the first target (if we aren&#x27;t all erased in a nuclear inferno) is going to be communications satellites.<p>Remember that a significant portion of how America fights battles is winning wars on paper so nobody ever thinks it&#x27;s a good idea to start a real one, and by that I mean a war against a competent enemy playing at the same level – not regional conflicts and proxy wars like we&#x27;ve been fighting since WWII.",1435651002

AFAIK, Denmark is patrolling the skies of the Baltic nations vs. Russia right now. I don&#x27;t think Denmark wants to do that in an obsolete 1970s fighter plane.<p>The F-35 looks like a disappointment, but we can be 100% sure it will be able to carry the newest weapons-systems for the foreseeable future. That begs the question; is it preferable to have ageing weapons on a nimble plane, or the newest weapons on a clumsy plane?<p>I don&#x27;t feel Europe has the luxury of skipping the F-35 (or equivalents, which the Saab is not, AFAIK) for a successful successor, when Putin is going crazy with propaganda inside Russia.",1435650933

Because transcribers will need to listen to audio again to be able to correct the mistakes made by ASR. Basically, once ASR listening to audio and then transcriber listening the audio again to correct mistakes made by ASR. Also, you will increase you cost as you will need costly &quot;editors&quot; to correct the ASR mistakes instead of cheaper &quot;transcribers&quot; to transcribe, reviewing and transcribing requires different skill set.<p>At one time I invested in a medical transcription business that experimented with voice-to-text technologies but couldn&#x27;t generate any additional efficiency in transcription by using technology. What worked in improving efficiency was the transcriber&#x27;s knowledge of medical terminology and medical field, matching the same transcriber with the same speaker as transcriber became acclimated with the nuances and tones of the speaker, and letting transcriber handle only certain type of transcription.<p>Transcription is a manual operation and Toyota Way is a good way to maximize efficiency.",1435650925

9803570,comment,9802675,9803454,0,0,geofft,,,"> Cost of recruiting drivers is relatively high - probably around $50-$100 per driver.<p>Hrm. Instead of working from first principles, we can poke at some data. Zen99 calculates that Uber seems to be spending some $1M/year on Craigslist ads for SF drivers alone [1], and as of the end of last year, they had about 16,000 drivers in SF [2]. Assuming generously that they recruited them all that year, that&#x27;s about $62 on Craiglist advertising per driver, much higher than your $5-10 estimate.<p>There are also incentives like an unconditional $500 on your first ride [3]. In NYC, Uber also offers new drivers a free defensive driving class and doctor&#x27;s examination at their offices [4], because they need those to get on the road. You will not find doctors to do exams for $2-5.<p>I would guess total driver acquisition cost, including first-trip incentives, is much more likely to be in the $1000-2000 range, at minimum. And we still haven&#x27;t gotten to long-term subsidies like uberPOOL, which is what I&#x27;m really curious about. Even a $10K driver acquisition cost could <i>maybe</i> be sustainable if each driver lasts over a year on average, since it&#x27;s a one-time cost. But it needs to pay better than taxi wages + cost of car maintenance for the driver, and at least break even for Uber, in the steady state.<p>[1] <a href=""https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/on-demand-is-in-demand"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/on-demand-is-in-demand</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/22/now-we-know-many-drivers-uber-has-and-how-much-money-theyre-making%E2%80%8B/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/22/n...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.driveubernyc.com/try"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.driveubernyc.com/try</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.driveubernyc.com/defensive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.driveubernyc.com/defensive</a>",1435649835

Other radio cab services like Meru (the oldest radio cab service), need at least a half hour for booking. You also need to provide your destination. Also paying cash is a real pain, because most cab drivers will just claim to not have change and try to pocket it.<p>Uber is a breath of fresh air here. It doesn&#x27;t force a destination, you can instantly know whether cars are available or not, generally arrives in 10 minutes or so, and there is no cash payment needed.<p>Where price is concerned, they&#x27;ve now managed to figure out the right pricing, so that an Uber ride costs only marginally more than a regular cab ride. e.g. Home to work takes around Rs 200 for a regular cab.

I wrote about what happened to me a while back, and there are enough similarities here that you might be interested in giving the story a read [1].<p>If you choose to fight over this issue, it&#x27;s going to come down to the attorneys. You&#x27;ll have to decide early on what the desired outcome is: do you want out, presumably compensated for your earlier investment, or do you still want to be part of the company with the rights due a shareholder? If, as I assume based on your wording, you invested money into the company as well as your labor, that helps make things much more clear cut which would make an agreement more likely. It&#x27;d still be long and messy, but not as long as a fight without that investment. It&#x27;s also possible that just hiring counsel will help them budge. Legally, there&#x27;s no real reason for them to delay awarding equity for three months unless they&#x27;re purposely trying to prevent you from exercising any input during the incubator program (and with any negotiations that occur during that time). At a very minimum, it makes things more difficult for them by hampering your relationship--and that&#x27;s something any outside investor will eventually stumble upon and start asking undesirable questions about assuming it doesn&#x27;t scare them off entirely to begin with.<p>That said, even if you prevail without having to litigate, you&#x27;re still going to lose. That, unfortunately, is inevitable: your co-founders have already amply demonstrated a willingness to stick a knife in your back. Even though shareholders have certain rights available to them, there&#x27;s no guarantee your co-founders will bother recognizing those rights. There are a myriad of different ways in which a minority shareholder can be oppressed and frozen out of the business. Whether they&#x27;re making decisions without informing you, cutting your wages outright (it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ll be paying dividends for some time), or purposely diluting your shares, they have the ability to make your life miserable with a fig leaf of justification thanks to their majority status and your only option for recompense is through the courts. And while it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;d eventually succeed, it&#x27;d only be after lengthy and expensive litigation--assuming, of course, that the startup doesn&#x27;t fail by the time you&#x27;re done (and the battle itself would certainly harm the company, particularly in the eyes of potential investors).<p>Leaving hurts. Being forced to leave hurts even more. But sticking around? Even if you feel that you win this round, even if they capitulate immediately, the knowledge that countless more are waiting just around the corner will wear you down. It&#x27;ll wear you down, suck away your savings to pay for constant legal advice even if you manage to avoid litigation, and it&#x27;ll do so while destroying every last thing that made you want to found a startup in the first place. One day, you&#x27;ll wake up and wonder just what happened to you thanks to what was, in the end, nothing more than a pyrrhic victory.<p>You won&#x27;t be the first, and you most certainly won&#x27;t be the last. As it stands, you&#x27;re in a no-win situation. Consult with an attorney before you make a move to avoid any potential problems (for instance, how much code did you write yourself versus other programmers/employees), take your code, and walk away.<p>P.S. - If they&#x27;re planning to get rid of you once all &quot;the code&quot; is written, it&#x27;s unlikely that the startup is going to succeed in the end anyhow. That sort of short-sighted attitude makes it abundantly clear that your partners have no real desire to improve upon the product over time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7579845"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7579845</a>",1435649260

The reported $470M operating loss on $410 revenue seems to be somewhat in same ballpark. I don&#x27;t believe current pricing is sustainable. I don&#x27;t see any cost advantage for Uber other than paying drivers less than the drivers-owners of regular cab service.<p>IMO, Uber may be hoping that once regular cab services are put out of business, Uber can raise the prices. The sustainable long term value prop seems to be ability to call up a cab using mobile app on your phone (request and dispatch portion of regular cab business). Everything else appears to contribute to loss.<p>I also don&#x27;t believe time has come for self-driving cars or will be in next 5 years at least.

Cost of recruiting drivers is relatively high - probably around $50-$100 per driver. This cost is composed of background check (probably $10-20), the ad that got them in the door ($5-10 for that click), the overhead cost of recruiting staff and onboarding staff and 1099 paperwork ($2-$5). Let&#x27;s be nice and say $50 is the cost. Again, being generous, if the average ride is $20, and Uber takes 20% ($4), that means that each driver needs to perform 13 rides for Uber to make their $$ back. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but anecdotally most drivers I&#x27;ve ridden with likely exceeded this, so I&#x27;d say they are good on this front.<p>2. In reading the recent CA administrative decision, the main damages were for reimbursement for mileage, at $0.56 per mile.  So this means that IF a state were to determine either that (a) drivers are employees or (b) drivers are not employees but some &quot;third-option hybrid&quot; for whom Uber still needs to reimburse miles, this would great eat into their margins and drag profitability down.",1435648085

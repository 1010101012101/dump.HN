5404203,comment,5400087,5400087,3,0,fjorder,,,"Interesting article.  Allow me to add a few fun details...<p>Early agriculturalists actually had it much rougher than this article implies for a real kicker of a reason:<p>Wild plants <i>suck</i> as crop plants.<p>Maize was domesticated from a bushy grass called teosinte (Agriculture arose independently in the Americas a little later than in the Middle East).  Google that and see how closely it resembles the big juicy corn-cobs you're used to.  Where corn has giant cobs crammed with hundreds upon hundreds of big juicy kernals, teosinte has a miserly amount of sad, pathetic, and tiny little kernals. You'd have to grow an entire field full of teosinte to equal the output of a small patch of corn.  If a modern farmer saw one of his fields being overgrown with teosinte he'd probably spray it with herbicide.   If some contagion wiped out all of our crop plants and we had to go back to wild crops we would be absolutely <i>humped</i> as a species.  Now, imagine how difficult it must have been to come up with the idea of settling down and growing crops to live on when the crops you could grow were basically weeds!<p>In fact, teosinte was so far from being a viable crop that some have proposed theories about intermediate steps.  For example, consider the Beer (or chicha) theory of civilization!  Somehow, somebody discovered that you can ferment teosinte into something that tastes weird and makes you act even weirder. Fun stuff!  While teosinte was not a crop you could build a viable farm on, maybe some hunter-gatherers stumbled upon the process of making chicha.  At first, collecting wild teosinte would have taken a lot of work.  Far too much for the calories yielded.  However, they probably had the time for the occasional novelty! Being lazy, these hunter-gatherers probably realized they could scatter some of the seeds they collected in a specific spot, continue their wanderings, and find a much denser patch of wild teosinte in the same spot a year later. They might even have started selecting which seeds to scatter, either fortuitously preferring the smaller ones for flavor or being smart enough to deliberately select the mutants with higher yields to sow for next year.  Perhaps the first steps towards agriculture (in the new world at least) were taken by the paleolithic equivalent of frat-boys!  Actually, no archaeologist would ever say that.  They would instead say, ""priests and shamans"" used the beer for religious ceremonies.  (Hot tip:  If archaeologists have no clue what something they find is for, they usually say it has ""possible religious significance"".)  It makes no real difference what their reasons were.  In this theory, the selective breeding of teosinte to produce maize can start long before people actually have to rely on maize to supply much in the way of calories.  Humankind's urge to get plastered may have ultimately led to civilization!<p>Wait!  There's more!  Proponents of this theory have also pointed out that beer solves a lot of problems early civilizations probably had.  Take water quality for example.  If a lot of hunter-gatherer's with no concept of germs or hygiene were to settle next to a river, you can bet that the river would be pretty deadly to drink out of before too long.  Fortunately, if you take some water, combine it with grain and ferment it, the result is a tasty fermented beverage that is safe to drink thanks to the wonders of alcohol!  (Early fermented beverages probably had a pretty low alchohol content and packed a healthy dose of calories.  Perfect for quenching the thirst and nourishing hard working agriculturalists from dawn till dusk!)  I could go on for a while...<p>TL;DR - Beer, rather than being an evil byproduct of civilization, may be what gave us both agriculture <i>and</i> civilization!  Beer is <i>good</i>.<p>Ham-fisted attempt to tie this back into all-things entrepreneurial:  The development of agriculture was a bit of a chicken-and-the-egg problem.  You can't have agriculture without crop-plants, but how could we have developed crop plants without agriculture?  <i>Beer</i>.  Sometimes, something that looks like a total waste of time becomes the foundation of very serious things (TM), such as the whole of human civilization.  Thanks to the adderall-fuelled march of progress we now get to see this process play out in a matter of years or even months!  Keep your eye on frivolous crap!",1363733920

This was popular because it would help deeply indebted farmers pay back their loans. William Jennings Bryan made a wonderful speech, the Cross Of Gold speech, on the issue: ""You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_silver"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_silver</a><p>In the extreme limiting case, the money economy based on the deflationary currency freezes to death: The rich are left holding money nobody else wants when the majority of society goes to some other currency that actually meets their needs.<p>In the non-Bitcoin world, the majority usually moves to another currency (a 'hard currency' like USD or Euros) when the local currency is hyper-inflationary toilet paper, but hyper-deflationary Super-Gold (Super-<i>Duper</i>-Super-Gold!) is, as has been explained, just as bad, and so would provoke the same reaction.",1363733875

Our entire wedding and honeymoon, including reception decorations, food, flowers (lots of flowers...), photos, dress (with alterations), and rings cost around $3000.<p>I don't even know how some people are capable of spending as much money as I've heard of them spending $20,000+ for a wedding? What in the world are you spending it on? It would've been easy to spend a couple thousand more, but it wasn't that hard to keep costs down. You just have to realize that it is OK to comparison shop, and you don't have to go with the high-status, first-advertised options for everything; if you look at more than just billboards and TV ads, you can still put together a really nice event for far less money.<p>When we went ring shopping, we decided on a budget ahead of time, and it turned out that our budget wasn't even the determining factor in which vendor we ended up buying from- it was who had the rings we liked the best. Tip, though- don't tell the salesmen that you're looking for a wedding ring; if you do, they will only show you a small, high-priced fraction of their total selection. My fiancee also decided ahead of time that she didn't want a diamond (diamonds are boring, green amethyst is much prettier), so it was very amusing when we found a genuine diamond ring on sale for only $90- much less than what we ended up spending on the rings we liked!",1363733858

(And yeah I pay for that fucking locker as well).<p>Any discussion of selling it would lead to a WWII like situation in the home. The cost of Gold might be skyrocketing but when you actually try to sell gold ornaments or diamonds it is a different game altogether because when I walk to sell the gold not one wants to buy it unless they know me or I pester them. So this is what happens when I met a jeweler to sell a gold chain my mother had made for me when I was 2 years old. Gold typically 15 times most costlier than that time. so I was expecting at least 1000% ROI.<p>1. I need to first determine if this is real Gold and how pure it is. For that you will have to pay me X. \n2. This chain is old and I cant sell it the way it is, it needs to be melted and converted into something else so I will lose Y value in the process. \n3. Making a new ornament out of this will lead to more loss of metal during melting and hence I will lose Z.<p>Then later he tells me that the gold is not ""as pure"" as I thought it to be. So eventually I make only 200% profit over period of around 12 years.

Another possibility might be velocity - look at the average age of unspent outputs (or, better yet, something like the sum of the inverse of the age over all coins, so lost coins automatically approach value zero) and add more currency units if it looks like things are going too slowly, but you would have to think long and hard to ensure that that's not gamable.

Certainly a lot of companies are doing well by giving away everything, but how long will the acquihire exit strategy remain open? Furthermore, the user is getting absolutely screwed. There have been a lot of notable services that have popped up over the last few years and then some big company came in to pick up the talent and dumped the  product and subsequently its users.<p>I've been fortunate to only get screwed twice, first with Gowalla and now with Google Reader. Although I used Google Reader for longer and much more frequently than Gowalla, in a way I feel less screwed (if at all) by Google. Google Reader is a very portable product by its natural connection to RSS. Google has also taken a few important steps towards making data portable for it's millions of users.<p>It took less than a minute to transfer to another service. I'm testing out Feedly for now, but I would rather host my own RSS reader and take control myself. If a consumer product provides adequate data portability the idea of hosting my content for me is something I feel perfectly comfortable doing.<p>My point is its less concerning that everything is free, but more how anti-competitive these services are with my data. If I can at any moment retain control and back up everything or move it over to a competing service, I'm okay with investing time in adopting a free service.<p>However, moving your data between services as they inevitably shutdown does seem like a short term fix. I think Marco's idea for a mirror of the reader API is a great long term solution[1]. For the average user, people would probably opt for a popular host.

You have monopolies with a ton of inertia in doing things the same way, plus a lot of the decision-makers are luddites in nature who think the human element is the single most important factor.<p>Times are changing as the economics of sports tightens and becomes more efficient, but it's not like there are ways to disrupt the market openly.

Moreover, Bitcoin is not secure as a multiparty computation protocol (also a kind of crypto) against malicious parties, as the attacker's work is polynomial in the system's parameters.<p>One should not make the mistake of trying to separate the security of cryptographic building blocks from the security of a system as a whole.  My ""pet"" example of this fallacy is ""robust"" encryption.  In a nutshell, an encryption system is ""robust"" if <i>only</i> the intended recipient can receive a valid message.  Using PGP to sign and then encrypt a message is <i>not</i> robust, even though the signature system, hash functions, and ciphers in PGP are secure as signature systems, hash functions, and ciphers.  The reason is pretty clear:  if you send a signed+encrypted message to me, I can decrypt it, encrypt the signed message for someone else, and then send them a valid message.<p>For most PGP users, robustness is not an important security property; usually, the recipient's name or some other identifying detail will be clearly written in the message.  On the other hand, for Bitcoin, the protection against double spending is <i>absolutely necessary</i>; a polynomial time double spending attack on Bitcoin is <i>very bad</i>.<p>""As a workaround, merchants will just demand more confirmations for higher-valued transactions""<p>Which only forces the attacker to make a polynomial increase in their work.  An attacker only needs to do as much work as the sum of the work done by all other participants in the system to remove any workaround.  Right now, that is well within the reach of governments, banks, and perhaps the larger criminal enterprises of this world.<p>""Checks and physical cash also wouldn't meet your definition of formal security, but seem to work in practice.""<p>It would not be the first time someone has proposed that digital cash go beyond what is possible with physical cash (see Page 2, Property (e)):<p><a href=""http://pdf.aminer.org/000/120/358/universal_electronic_cash.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdf.aminer.org/000/120/358/universal_electronic_cash....</a>",1363731061

That playbook does not work well selling into the F500. In particular, BigCo's don't respond productively to passive sales processes. A lot of the things you do to optimize passive sales, like free trials or tiered account models, don't really help F500 procurers. It is sometimes just as hard for those people to spend $5000 on something as it is to spend $100,000. Sometimes, it's actually better for those people to spend $100,000 on something even if $5000 would buy them a reliable call option on the value of the product.<p>There's a reason the enterprise sales playbook leans so heavily on inside dial-for-dollars sales and direct account managers: that process works.",1363731052

Does the API handle merging of the update events on the client side, or do I have to do all that work myself from the stream of insert/removal events?  Can I handle them myself if I want?  Assuming I want to extend the UI of these updatable strings, so that people can see other people's cursors and such, what would I need to do?  Is the client-side library extendable so it can update my UI without hammering my customizations (cursor position, formatting, embedded data transformed into HTML)?  How will that scale once the document grows to a considerable size (will I be able to update only changed portions of the DOM created by a large document without doing my own complex diffing logic on the client side)?<p>For example, build me a basic rich text editor in this that mimicks some of the features of Docs, and show me how much extra code that takes.

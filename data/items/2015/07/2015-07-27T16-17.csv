I think the real problem is that it was clunky and made people mess with something that they had no interest in using.<p>It was a weirdly forcing move which reminded everyone how much power Google wields in this kind of user/company relationship. People are probably generally okay with how that works, but only if they aren&#x27;t made painfully aware of it (kind of like DRM - just look at Steam for an example of that).",1438016390

Everyone else has to beg dozens of manufacturers to ship an update for a device which brings no further revenue to the hardware manufacturer<p>> 4. At least in the U.S. everyone then has to beg carriers to ship an update to existing devices rather than using this as a chance to push you to upgrade to a $$$ new device and extended contract lock-in<p>The solution is for Google to pay manufacturors (or share revenue, however you want to put it) to update all existing phones:<p>- Google is accountable for shipping the bug. They should pay the costs.<p>- Google is currently taking almost all the profits. Android phone makers, as we&#x27;ve all read, are running on thin margins, if they aren&#x27;t losing money. The media stories that say Apple makes 95% of all mobile profits fails to include Google&#x27;s profits.<p>Google <i>not</i> doing this is, IMHO, an ethical breach and putting profits before users greed.

Knowledge cannot be destroyed (and it&#x27;s very unclear of the damage caused by the destruction of the knowledge required to build autonomous drones outweighs the benefits humanity would derive from other applications of the same knowledge), so our only option as purported &quot;good guys&quot; is to arm ourselves.

If you have shorting, you don&#x27;t know if those are people dipping toes, closing out shorts, or someone getting ready to take a large position.

9956278,comment,9955435,9955435,0,0,AUmrysh,,,"Autonomous weapons are coming, and in some degree already exist. There are CV systems on machineguns in korea protecting the border. There&#x27;s the TrackingPoint rifle scope that allows one to delay a shot until the rifle is line up perfectly, similar to how tank cannons account for the wobble down their length to ensure a straight shot).<p>It would be ridiculously easy right now for a person to attach a firearm to a quadrotor with a CV system, program it to identify human shaped objects, and fire at them. It&#x27;s not a miracle that such a thing hasn&#x27;t happened, there are very few people in this world with both the desire and skills to do these things.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of a short story I read a few years back [1]. It got me thinking about the possibility of a single depressed individual hitting the big red button and destroying all humanity. I think it&#x27;s a real possibility, and when you think it through with the assumption that these super-weapons will be readily available much in the same way that AK-47s are ubiquitous now, you can start to wrap your head around ways to perhaps prevent this.<p>First, mental health is a huge issue. We&#x27;re seeing the results of neglecting mental health in America now with these spree/ego shootings, where disturbed individuals either radicalize or &quot;snap&quot; and go kill people in malls, churches, theaters, schools, and other public places. Semi-automatic firearms and explosives are enabling these things to happen, but weapons are a Pandora&#x27;s box which can never be closed once opened. The way that nuclear weapons restrictions are handled now is probably best. Restrict the ingredients to make the weapons, and you can prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.<p>Another thing that we as a global society can do to prevent these weapons from becoming widespread is to sabotage them. Include vulnerabilities and kill switches that would allow us to neutralize their effectiveness. China did this with the ASICs used in some military machines built by the US [2]. This is a valid option, but requires a motivation on the part of those creating the devices. One could argue that a nation-state could create devices like this lacking intentional back-doors.<p>Engineers can also work on counter-measures and disseminate them widely, and that seems like it will be the most likely outcome. Humans are clever, AI is very specialized, and that will make the big difference. Once a general AI better than humans is created, our desire to not be murdered by it won&#x27;t really matter anyway.<p>I think our best hope is to build these AI weapons, but do it so shittily that they fail more than they work. I also like the American technique of building it better than everyone else and sabotaging the work of any potential rival so that they can develop them but not realize they don&#x27;t work correctly until it&#x27;s too late.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal</a>

Since it wasn&#x27;t at a perfect 90 degree angle, the CCD strips each crossed over the plane defined by the Sun-Earth line and the axis orthogonal to the Earth&#x27;s orbit (I referred to it as &quot;south&quot;) at an angle.<p>So, if you want to stitch together an image of the sky that looks continuous, but the orbit of the imager wobbles a bit, and different discontinuities show up every day, how do you do it?<p>The leading CCD could be entirely across the southern line when the other CCDs were just starting to cross it. This created a lot of problems with how you define a complete orbit that lacks discontinuities and makes intuitive sense so others can understand the code.<p>I decided to pick the point where the middle of the central camera crossed the plane as the frame of reference for the start/end point.<p>Ultimately, this project took me about three months, just to get used to the code base, the spatial coordinates and transformations needed to make sense of the data, and then to finally write the code.<p>The meaningful changes I made in the commit consisted of about three lines of code.<p>I found the commit message:<p>Fixed problem near seam of map where start and end of orbit meet. The orientation of camera 2 at the start of the orbit is now used to draw a reference great circle on the sky. Near this boundary pixels are tested individually to decide whether they are part of the current orbit and should be dropped in the skymap. Introduced torigin to keep track of the time origin for the lowres time map. This is added to the Fits header of the time map as keyword TORIGIN (used to be STIME). Times tfirstfrm and tlastfrm are assigned the time of the first and last frame, respectively, for which at least one pixel was dropped in the skymap. These are written into the main header of the skymap as keywords STIME and ETIME. Added extra extension to lowres maps containg nr of pixels contributing to each lowres bin<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotati...</a>",1438014934

Businesses can&#x27;t just raise prices and get more revenue. If they could, they would do that already.<p>Minimum wage has to do with marginal cost of producing an extra product. Marginal cost generally increases after a while. So producing that last additional unit usually costs more than the one before. When you increase cost in the form of the price of human capital, the marginal cost of producing a unit will increase and the intersection with the marginal revenue (price of the unit) will drop to a lower quantity supplied and higher price.<p>So yes, prices will go up but the business will also sell less units. Since less units are sold, there will be less capital that will need to be utilized.<p>Prices aren&#x27;t arbitrarily set and increase in price will result in less units being sold and less employment. This isn&#x27;t as controversial as journalists make it out to be.<p>Pre-political Paul Krugman does a great job explaining it:<p>> So what are the effects of increasing minimum wages? Any Econ 101 student can tell you the answer: The higher wage reduces the quantity of labor demanded, and hence leads to unemployment. This theoretical prediction has, however, been hard to confirm with actual data. Indeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages “do,” in fact, reduce employment, but that the effects are small and swamped by other forces.<p>> What is remarkable, however, is how this rather iffy result has been seized upon by some liberals as a rationale for making large minimum wage increases a core component of the liberal agenda–for arguing that living wages “can play an important role in reversing the 25-year decline in wages experienced by most working people in America” (as this book’s back cover has it). Clearly these advocates very much want to believe that the price of labor–unlike that of gasoline, or Manhattan apartments–can be set based on considerations of justice, not supply and demand, without unpleasant side effects.[0]<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/03/02/paul-krugmans-amazing-about-face-on-the-minimum-wage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/03/02/paul-krug...</a>",1438014843

What is already being done in that regard is arguably military intelligence technology directed indiscriminately at entire populations, but the added element of powerful AI spidering over the data streams that go into places like the NSA Bluffdale facility is quite appalling.
I think this is even harder to inspect for than autonomous killing systems, and even more difficult to avoid the development of, since much of the capabilities needed will likely be similar to what academia and data-intensive commercial sector will want to serve their needs.

The seminal study in this vein examined fast-food restaurants on both sides of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border before and after New Jersey raised its minimum wage in the early 1990s. It found no evidence that employment there fell as a result.<p>This is often cited in publications that generally support a higher minimum wage. It is unfortunate that this is never challenged as there are studies that show that an increase in minimum wage does in fact result in lower employment:<p>> Raising the minimum wage would increase family income for many low-wage workers, moving some of them out of poverty. But some jobs for low-wage workers would probably be eliminated and the income of those workers would fall substantially. [0]<p>Logic itself would suggest that an increase in minimum wage would result in at least some unemployment:<p>No employer would hire you if you make them less than the amount that they have to pay you. There are people that make more than the old minimum wage and less than the new proposed minimum wage. Therefore, those employment opportunities will no longer exist. It may not happen overnight as there is some momentum, but you can&#x27;t deny this effect. Also, you can&#x27;t exactly measure the people that would have been hired with a lower minimum wage.<p>The other interesting this is how vernacular plays such a strong role in people&#x27;s opinions. Imagine if &quot;minimum wage&quot; was replaced with &quot;prohibition of employees whose contributions to employers is less than the mandated minimum amount of finding legal employment&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995</a>",1438014008

What stops a smaller or even poorer country from building a robot army? Poor countries have more manufacturing capacity than wealthy ones, AFIAK, and perhaps they need only one innovative, disruputive software developer to make their bot army superior or at least competitive.

The Linux kernel has kzalloc for this purpose as an alternative to kmalloc and it&#x27;s fairly widely used.<p>Sometimes it is inefficient to set something to zero, when that is not the true initial value (some or all of the zeros will be overwritten with the true initial value before the object is used). If you malloc some structure and then painstakingly initialize every member, then calloc is wasteful.<p>If you malloc some structure, and then forget to initialize some of the members, calloc will hide that bug by initializing them to all zero bits. This might not be the correct value. If the uninitialized parts of the structure aren&#x27;t clobbered from zeros, you can get an accurate diagnostic about that from a tool like Valgrind. On the other hand, if you aren&#x27;t using that tool, the behavior with zeros is more deterministic. E.g. if a pointer is not initialized, but overwritten with zeros, on most mainstream platforms that will be a null pointer whose dereferencing uses are detected.  If you don&#x27;t have such a tool available, having the uninitialized bits be all zero is arguably better.<p>Much of this reasoning mirrors reasoning about whether to initialize a local variable to zero, if its true initialization actually happens later.",1438013132

When they do decide to go 'online' they will just ad it into the existing offerings - example:""Office 2010, now comes with free online office as well.. including powerpoint, word, excel... with 30 gigs of free online secure storage"" - also a double save feature if your connected to the net, when you save a document local it will ask if you wanted to save to the 'cloud' -<p>- MS is more trusted for the average business than zoho or even google, and already has a built in market.",1212767792

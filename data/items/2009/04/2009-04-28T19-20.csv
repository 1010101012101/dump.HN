What I don't understand is why people feel it is acceptable to say ""If you don't finish X task, then you are not as good.""<p><pre><code>  The trick was that when I started working in a lab or on startup ideas, I get the same dopamine rush that was spoken of in a previous. Working on classes that I could learn on my own time, destroying my happiness and health, when there is real good I could do in the world doesn't make sense from a utilitarian point of view; yet society functions on a credentialing system (as pg spoke of in one of his essays).
</code></pre>
Many people give the same advice: work from within the system, if you pay your dues, more doors will be open. It is insanely frustrating, and pointlessly wasteful. What would make more sense is saying that if you want to work in a given area, you need to have X experience or a certification.<p>After a certain point, college (undergrad anyway) is just a grind that produces nothing useful. Lip service is paid to learning and then they grade you. Sometimes this makes sense and they are a fair representation of your knowledge, other times they are a random disconnected sampling. In certain classes, grading may make sense, but it reduces learning by encouraging certain kinds of depth first thinking.<p>What we need to do is break out of this acceptance of how things are done. For instance, if college is a credentialing process, then why are you required to take a class in order to gain a credential? If you get a C in a class, why should you be required to take it again (with all the work that entails) rather than just retesting? Some classes require attendance. Should not all the materials be provided so that you can learn on your own? This is not always the case.<p>If college is a holistic learning program, we should not be grading students or grade them in a way that does not expose them to hardship later ( e.g. by never revealing them to the outside world ). In my case, I know I would more thoroughly if I wasn't facing constant deadline pressure. Perhaps we could have a situation that is more  you either present some results of your research or are given an oral examination that requires quick thinking.<p>College could be far more fun than it is, and far more educational. As it exists, it is a tedious compromise between an education and a certification. As a society, we need to figure out what we really want, because we are most certainly doing it wrong (whether my solutions are correct or not) at every level (I could recite what I learned about graduate school, but I have gone on long enough).",1240947963

So to find that sort of thing here and discussed by people calling me a sad angry little man really just isn't a good way for me to start the day, and it's <i>not</i> how I want to approach my work. So I'm mad because I'm finding myself seriously debating something I wasn't exactly serious about in the first place, but I've got a sense of propriety about my writings and so I refuse to let people dis what I've said without defending myself.

Again: apologies.<p><i>Causes for these things are shared - blame is given to one side or the other for their own actions.</i><p>Okay. By that standard I'm blaming the nerds for deliberately setting up a situation wherein they're persecuted, when they could easily avoid the entire situation by not being so deliberately hostile.

Right now, ram is my big bottleneck.<p>most single-socket systems only let you install 8GB ram (4x2gb modules)  so I've got to buy twice as many single socket boards to get the same amount of ram.  It's ok, I guess if you need more cpu than ram.<p>The other problem is that you usually have to go to a server-class board to get low-power CPUs.  I know of no desktop CPU that can compete with the Xeon L series or the Opteron HE series.   (Sure, there are low-power desktop CPUs, but none of them have the performance of the Xeon L or opteron HE.   If you know of a quad-core desktop CPU that eats less than 75w I'd be happy to hear about it.)<p>I'm sure google pays less per watt than I do, but still, if you plan on keeping hardware around for two years, the ongoing cost per watt makes a big difference.  Low power CPUs save serious money, even if they cost more up front.<p>Opteron HE bartons are ridiculously cheap right now.  1.8Ghz quad-core HE processors are around $100 on newegg right now.

If I made it sound like that I fucked up big-time.<p>What I said was that it's the attitude above that leads to physical violence. When somebody starts wanting to punch somebody in the face, it comes from that particular level of dickery.<p>I am not at all a violent person. I don't fight people, I don't hit people. I don't have a personality that leads to fights. The closest I get to violence is posting angry things online. And I'm certain that writing all these responses at 7 in the morning might have dimmed my writing a bit, but I never <i>once</i> implied violence.<p>What I said, again, was this:<p><i>If we were having this argument in real life and I was a more naturally violent person, I'd probably hit you, and then in your eyes I'd become the bully and you wouldn't be guilty of anything.</i><p>That's not me threatening. In fact, the one ""threat"" I made was the one where I lock out my Hacker News account because debates like this are a waste where nobody learns a damn thing. The point I was making was that chairface's comment was aggravating and glossing over points in a way that was smarmy and obnoxious. (His response to the parent post clarified a lot, so props to him.) That's an attitude that's not just on Hacker News. A friend of mine had it when he'd constantly pester a violent kid just to provoke a reaction. He'd get clocked in the eye and tell us all what a savage that other kid was. The point of my stupid poorly written blog post was that this is a common attitude amongst nerds when they handle things socially. They'll do things that they know will alienate them because they think the alienation is forthcoming anyway. In doing that they give themselves some ""control"" over their hopeless state.<p>I mean, I'm certain I'm talking to somebody who knows what I'm talking about. I've seen a lot of people dismiss your blog posts because of the ""ZED'S SO FUCKING AWESOME"" logo or because of your many elongated, poorly written rants. I'm too lazy to search back, but I've gotten into a lot of Zed debates on this site where you get slammed because your old web site was just begging for people to call you immature. You obviously knew that would happen and you went on doing it anyway, so you fit into the category of people I'm talking about here.<p>You're quoting me saying a lot of shit I didn't say, Zed. Cut that out; if you're going to get pissed off at me get pissed off at me for what I believe.<p>I <i>never</i> said violence was defensible. I have friends who have been molested and harassed and hurt. I think it's one of the most terrible things there is. And this entire argument is such a loose tangent from the argument I originally made that it was stupid of me to respond in the first place. I'm aware of that. There's a difference between an abused woman and an abused nerd. Nerd abuse is largely petty in nature. I know maybe two kids in my nerd group who got into fights, <i>ever</i>, and neither of those was a case of random abuse: both sides wanted to pummel the other side. So when the argument sifted away from petty and towards serious, my response should have been: that's not the same thing. Abuse and rape stem from an entirely other side of human existence than things like teasing and name-calling.<p>Child abuse is <i>not</i> name-calling. If you're suggesting that calling somebody a name is child abuse, you're off your fucking rocker. If a nerd is getting hit and hurt for what he's saying and doing, there's something pathological behind that happening; when a nerd is ostracized because he acts like a jackass, he's responsible for its happening.<p>The point I was trying to make, half-asleep, earlier today was that people who are getting seriously abused should take action to stop the abuse. If you're getting beat up or raped then you should take action to stop it from happening, because otherwise you're letting a guilty person get away with a crime. The only blame on the other person is letting the criminal get away. They aren't responsible for the horrible things being done to them.<p>But now I'm just repeating myself, and to be honest I can't tell if you just flew off at me because you think I said a terrible thing or if, like your critics claim, flipping out just gets you off. If it's the former, then I've clarified myself, and I'm sorry for sounding like I meant something I absolutely do not. If it's the latter, we've got nothing left to talk about.",1240946851

Does anyone honestly think either of those would go over well?",1240946403

No one has the right to insist that  other people live in such a manner as not to give them the slightest offense..<p>If  some of the people involved genuinely felt that ""there is no problem"" and other people say that ""no there is a problem"", and there is no consensus, then  the best that can be done is to say, ok folks, each of you act according to what you think is right (and suffer any consequences therefrom) and we'll see who prevails.<p>""A sincere apology and a few words saying that some attention will be paid towards these things in the future would have sufficed.""<p>This assumes that the apology needs to be made at all.
For the apology to be ""sincere"" the person who is supposed to apologize  has to feel he has done something wrong, and more importantly <i>care</i> that other people got offended.<p>DHH for one obviously doesn't care what other people think, and I respect the man for being consistent in his beliefs and not backing down before people trying to lay some pc guilt trip on him.<p>I am just a little wary of the ""no one should be offended in any manner"" idea.<p>In the end, this is open source software. ""Shut up and write code"" is probably more useful  advice than all this political correctness laden hand wringing.<p>If people who didn't like the talk had just walked out, no one would know or care if some guy somewhere made some off kilter presentation.

The reason I moved to Lisp is simple. I was tired of syntax. I was tired of the language straight jacket. I'm always surprised that these things never bother other programmers. It surprises me even more that programmers tediously compare the features of their language when any non-trivial program means a large API (that is a language on top of another language). Once you realize that, who really cares about language features? What you want is something malleable. You want something that can program the program. You want (as has been said elsewhere) a language for growing languages.  Instead of wasting time learning about each language's arcane meta programming facilities- learn how to write macros, and you can have all the meta programming facilities you'll ever need. But this doesn't seem to interest most programmers, I guess that's part of the individual difference thing.",1240946040

Just from high school biology I can name three different ways to create a vaccine for a virus, and checking my knowledge on Wikipedia reveals a bunch more.  Yet there are still many viruses we can't vaccinate against.  Stuff in biology is incredibly complex and specific.  Adapting a successful technique to a very slightly different situation can be straightforward, or it can be a major research project.  You could easily pick, as your first ""original"" project, something that would require a scientific breakthrough to accomplish, and it would take you years to advance to the point of even realizing it.  If that sounds rewarding to you, you're probably already professionally involved in an intellectual field deeply enough that you want your hobbies to have entirely different rewards and challenges.<p>Feynman's memoirs are some of the most intellectually macho posturing I've ever read, and even he stuck mostly to physics when he was doing physics.

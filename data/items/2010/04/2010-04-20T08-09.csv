But it's another matter to disallow flash and air applications that could be a used to write platform independent applications.<p>There is just a lot of assumptions and unproven statements in your post. I've heard that so many times, it sickens me.<p>Some anecdote: A few months back, when Adobe announced Flash support on the iPhone, basically everyone in my circle of friends was like ""woohoo, soon i'll be able to play those flashgames!"". Now, everyone is just repeating the marketing talks, that flash is bad and whatnot.
Basically i have the feeling that many people don't reflect what Steve is saying, they are just repeating the marketing talks. Basically, that's what is driving me mad.<p>Also, i don't see a reason why a desktop OS wouldn't work on a tablet (except for the aforementioned appstore lock in). Display too small? Nope, works on small netbooks, too. Can't hit the buttons? No, i am currently sitting in front of Windows 7 and i can't spot a button that i couldn't hit with a finger. Links in Websites are usually way smaller then the buttons in the OS and you still can hit them on the iPad, don't you?<p>Also, a few months back it was ""oh no. Multitasking? That's sooo draining the battery, we won't allow that!"". Now, that android poses a threat it's like ""uhh, we miraculously implemented multitasking!"".

Yeah, there might be wrong judgments when humans are involved, no one could disagree with that. The way out, however, is not to force journalists to report everything, the way out is to make sure there are always a good many journalists writing about the same stuff.<p>Journalists have to make judgments all the time, they have to decide which parts of a story are important and which parts are irrelevant. If they didn’t do that – if they weren’t allowed to do that – they wouldn’t do their job. Reporting whatever you hear and see is not what being a journalist means.<p>You can have nice arguments about which judgments are the right ones, which are the wrong ones. Saying that Gizmodo should just report whatever they know is not such a argument.<p>(You actually start to make the right kind of argument in your last paragraph which is nice but I don’t see how there is any evidence at all that hints at the scenario you are describing. There are always many things which are possible but that’s hardly a convincing argument. Evidence is what’s needed.)<p>Note please, that the New York Times [1] doesn’t mention the name.

3065663,comment,3065456,3065456,4,0,hopeless,,,"I've always had headaches but some months are worse than others. I wear glasses for driving but generally not for every day wear (it's a psychological thing) and I've generally put it down to that.<p>After 3-4 days of a constant splitting headache which felt like I'd been hit with a cleaver, I noticed a lump at the back of my head/neck. This was finally enough to make me go to the doctor (obviously fearing brain cancer or some other deathly disease). The doctor diagnosed ""Occipital Neuralgia"" [1] which is basically the compression of one of the scalp nerves as it exits the spinal column. As I often end up slumped forward in my chair, head angled up, this was compressing those nerves and causing the pain. It had never occurred to me that the pain could have a physical cause. Since then, better posture control has meant very few headaches.<p>The lump it turns out is just a swollen glad, possibly from an unrelated minor infection or from the swollen nerve itself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_neuralgia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_neuralgia</a>",1317635970
3065662,comment,3064952,3065218,1,0,hampusw,,,"There's nothing keeping you from running a separate web server and then proxying requests to Node using HTTP. Why is it a problem that you do this using HTTP? What alternative protocol would be so much better? FastCGI isn't really that different (each have their pros and cons) and CGI has obvious problems...<p>WSGI applications can use a built-in HTTP server too (or FastCGI or ...). Node has an internal interface (similar to WSGI) for handing over requests to the web application and so on. That's not fundamentally different from WSGI. The main difference is that WSGI is a standard API, so there are several ""WSGI servers"" implementing the same thing (each of them similar to Node in some sense).",1317635933

3065652,comment,3064952,3065554,2,0,christkv,,,"Most web applications are io bound not cpu bound as they spend most of their time talking to other systems across the network like your db or queue or some rest service. the cost of spinning up threads is memory and context switches by the os. Async is just a way to avoid this for io operations. Node.js is just an incredibly convenient way of doing this as there are less ways of shooting yourself in the foot than if you apply the async patterns to other tech platforms.<p>Cpu bound is still cpu bound on any tech platform and needs another strategy to deal with it. I think it's better to look at node.js as a tool in your toolbox that is well adapted to running high load web-services and apps that are io bound instead of a swiss army-knife that does everything great.<p>But as any toolbox you need more tools in the box to be a good carpenter. That includes picking tech that can do the cpu bound stuff in a appropriate manner, be it java, scala, c++, erlang whatever. You don't write a graph database in node.js unless you are masochistic. Just as you hopefully don't write an async server in assembly.<p>From my usage perspective node.js is great for my async needs and the low resource usage means I need less hardware to scale my typical web app.",1317635531

Not to mention the spherical abberation and the PVD I've had in both eyes, due to a combination of kickboxing and my eyes being so bad, It triggered the condition at young age.<p>I can't look at white screens for too long, the floaters in front of my eyes will start to give me headaches because they distract me from my focus point. \nI've been getting chronic headaches for a year and a half now, but even though I'm pretty handicapped in my eyesight, here are some tips:<p>- Make sure you're not staring into bright daylight/ not sitting right next to a window, which will make it harder for you to focus.\n- Use as much black as possible, a black theme is a must for your editor! I hated Zend studio when they stopped being easily to configure in the theme department.  When I found Apatana Studio I fell in love with the default dark themes.<p>- Make sure your monitors are up to date. Your resolution and sharpness of Fonts must be adequate. And if you feel yourself leaning over to read something on your screens. We have a problem...\nI'm sporting two 27""  monitors right now at EYE HEIGHT.\nWhich leads me to...<p>POSTURE POSTURE POSTURE POSTURE POSTURE.\n- Leaning forward is NOT good. Better, angle backwards a little bit if your chair allows it. If you start leaning forward, your back muscles will tense up, which will tense up your shoulders, which will tense up your neck...which will tense up your scalp, and there we go, chronic tension headache.\nRelax your shoulders, make sure they're not shrugged up when you're using your keyboard and mouse. Otherwise fix your chair/desk height.<p>- Ok so we can also get the migraines out a little bit, they are more often caused by eye strain, or poor circulation.  Quit smoking, leave your work area for a short stroll from time to time. I get the sharp migraines a little bit less.<p>- Tension headaches might also result from a misconfiguration in the bedroom area. Wrong mattress, wrong cushions: headache.",1317635221

3361037,comment,3360556,3360556,21,0,brudgers,,,"Like many philosophical puzzles, this one is based on mapping [torturing] ordinary language into a formally logical model.<p>In this case ""surprise"" seems suspect since it is an emotional and physical response - things which are likely to be difficult to predict using formal systems.<p>Then of course, there is the fact that the surprise is announced before hand rather than exclaimed - ""Surprise!"" - at the actual event as is the case with a surprise party...and of course surprise parties often do not surprise the person for which they are planned - indeed, sometimes forewarning is a necessary part of the surprise party plan.<p>Just as a surprise party is rated a success based upon the general standards for parties even when the person for whom it is thrown is not actually surprised (though acting surprised is often helpful), a surprise exam is successful based upon the relevant academic criteria. One simply does not fail a surprise exam because they were expecting it.<p>What the professor announced was essentially, ""On one day next week, there will be an exam. I am not telling you which day that will be."" Whatever paradox we imagine finding is dependent on us deeming the purpose of the exam to be to cause surprise among the students, rather than getting them to study or measuring their knowledge or any of the legitimate purposes of the context.<p>Of course this does not make as interesting a story.<p>But it is hardly news that a flawed algorithm may produce flawed results.<p>The problem is that we are trying to treat ordinary language as if it was psuedocode.<p><pre><code>        For i = 5 to 1

3361031,comment,3360621,3360875,7,0,nirvana,,,"The claim in the article is false.  Apple doesn't want high ebook pricing, because Apple is a hardware manufacturer. iTunes and all the content it sells, was created as a loss leader to generate demand for their hardware. Apple historically has fought very hard to keep content prices down.<p>At the time that iBooks was announced, there were many stories on this issue, and I read that the agreement Apple entered into with the book publishers was that they could set their prices however they wanted, they just couldn't charge <i>more</i> on the iBookstore than they charged elsewhere.[1]<p>Apple gave them pricing flexibility, provided that they didn't do what you point out the record companies did.<p>The book publishers liked this, and wanted the same terms from Amazon.  They figured they could just go with Apple if Amazon didn't comply.  Amazon rolled over, and ever since their PR agency has been floating stories like this one to make out like Apple is behind the rise in ebook prices.<p>Apple isn't.  Apple just wanted the iBookstore to be competitive and offer low prices.<p>[1] The reason Apple lets publishers set prices is the same reason Apple lets app developers set prices.  The iBookstore is open to just about anyone, even very small publishers. Apple isn't in the business of pricing retail products like this, and figures if the producer of the product sets the pricing, then the market will be more efficient.  The notable exception to this, of course, is the music industry, which was the first part of the iTunes store, and which Apple had to work to keep prices down.  Also in the TV and movies section they work to keep prices down.  Maybe they could have dictated pricing for books, but if they had, it would have been to keep prices down, not up, like they did for the other categories.  The ""price it whatever you want"" model worked on the appstore to provide a vibrant community where great apps can be had for $0.99.  Its not unreasonable to expect Apple expected something similar in the iBookstore.",1324051094

The warning ""Stall! Push stick forward!"" would therefore have saved the day, even if the copilot pulling back ignored it (and it seems he thought he was doing the right thing by pulling back, so the explicit advice ""Push stick forward!"" might have helped in his mental state), the other two would realise he was contravening normal response.",1324050965

That is the reason most of this protections must have an override.<p>The modes are automatic, if you have all the flight computers and inputs available it will be at normal mode, if you begin loosing computers or inputs (like speed) it no longer has the capability to have that protections active so it downgrades itself, if there is a recovery of some sort (computer reset or working again pitot) it will upgrade the mode to normal by itself. The only action that can be taken is resetting computers or trying to recover a system. In fact when we want to practice alternate or direct law in the simulators, we just disconnect some flight computers. It is not that different flying in alternate or direct law than it is flying normal mode (just a bit more dizzy), unless you try something like pulling the control all the way back for 3 minutes.<p>Here there is a resume of the airbus flight laws:<p><a href=""http://www.airbusdriver.net/airbus_fltlaws.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.airbusdriver.net/airbus_fltlaws.htm</a><p>Pd. mechanical backup, THAT is difficult to fly!.

3360907,comment,3360682,3360775,5,0,diego,,,"VCs are more likely to give money to entrepreneurs who are already rich. There's a good reason for it: VCs (unlike angels) need home runs. Over the course of 10 years, a VC must catch a Facebook, a Google or at least a Twitter in order to be successful.<p>A rich founder is less likely to take an early exit, and more likely to want to swing for the fences. Think of @ev refusing to sell Twitter to Google as an example.<p>Also, an already successful entrepreneur is less risky from a VC standpoint. He was able to endure the process of taking a startup from zero to something. He's more likely to have ""what it takes"" to succeed.<p>That said, this guy is not acting rationally by flaunting his ability to raise money. Like he admits, he doesn't have a team yet.

Few reviewers take the effort to dig in and critique what the product does. Given this status quo its hard to blame anyone for equating cosmetics with design.<p>Fun question - is emacs well designed ? What would a reviewer on engadget etc say if they came across it. Would they concede it has a better design than say - Textmate?<p>When Apple fans talk about the product being well designed its inevitably about the physical manifestation of the product - how it looks, what its battery life is, its weight etc. I fully concede that apple products are well designed in their own right and have a fantastical attention to detail, but the only details that get covered in the press and by evangelists are the ones that have to do with cosmetics or physical attributes.<p>Lastly - someone on this thread mentioned craigslist as having bad design. I think that is the classic example of equating cosmetics with design. I have yet to find another website that allows me to finish the task at hand with as little fuss and as few clicks. There are flaws to craigslist - like their ability to curate content in realtime - but their design to me is unobtrusive and efficient.",1324048566

If you don't have much traction, or even a prototype, and you do raise money, you're giving up a BIG portion of equity in return.<p>A good analogy is the music industry.  Lots of bands just starting out want to be signed to a major record label.  They do everything they can to attract the attention of major record execs.  A very tiny minority are successful and actually gets a contract, but they end up making almost no money, because they weren't able to negotiate from a position of power.  The alternative is the band who sets up their own sales and distribution and builds their audience.  Now they can dictate what deals (if any) they take.  They don't need the major label anymore, but they're in a position to take advantage of it, if there's a favorable deal there.<p>Suggesting that entrepreneurs raise money early is bad advice almost always.  Regardless of the initial deal you might be able to get, having a more developed product with traction will get you a better deal.<p>Just build it, eat ramen noodles and take a second job if you have to.  Meet with investors early and often, but not to ask for money.  Let them see the trajectory of what you're building, so that when you want/need to raise money, they know you and see how far you've come and what you're capable of.  There seems to be way too much focus on raising money early, and articles like this only exacerbate that.",1324048254

I remember from the music business that Amazon did undercut Apples prices, but it wasnt because Apple was unable to make money at a lower price point. It was because the music labels forced Apple to maintain higher prices and then allowed Amazon to offer the same tracks at a lower price in order to generate competition that would give them the leverage they needed to negotiate <i>higher</i> music prices from Apple in the future.<p>Which they got, and now they can offer a sliding scale of prices, with some tracks being $1.29, something that Jobs and Apple resisted.<p>So now Im reading that Apple is trying to price fix all books at the same price, and I am mightily interested in knowing the full story. Perhaps the problem isnt that Apple is trying to maintain artificially high prices, but that it is trying to prevent publishers from shackling it and it alone with higher prices.",1324047827

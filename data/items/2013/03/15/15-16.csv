Every ten years there is an Earth shattering crisis in the country, and there has been a 25-30% inflation for the past 4 years, likely to grow. There is a pararel market for US dollars, as it is controlled and it's almost impossible to buy legally (unless you are travelling overseas, 60 USD per day with a top of 1000 USD per trip, 2 trip max per year).<p>If you have international clients, you'll get ARS at the official rate (5 ARS == 1 USD) but will have to pay international providers with the parallel rate (8 ARS == 1 USD). That alone, coupled with rising insecurity, blocked imports and unpredictable government, makes starting a company there a very unsound decision.<p>The good things about it is that you have relatively cheap workforce (30000 USD will pay a good engineer), there are many good engineers, it's in roughly the same timezone as the US (GMT-3) and culturally is much more similar to the US than, for example, India.<p>Having said all of the above, I've moved to the Netherlands, and couldn't be happier so far. I've been in Silicon Valley for about 3 months total, and Amsterdam is as safe as Mountain View is, but without the heavy police presence and you can actually <i>walk</i> anywhere (the city feels like a town in that regard).

Restricting a program to physically secured hardware along with software protection would definitely make it extremely difficult to get the program or information outside of the way that the maker wants you to. Although I am not entirely convinced that it would be <i>impossible.</i> The issue is that it still must be a deterministic system. And this means that with enough money, expertise, time, precision someone could produce a situation in which they would be able extract the code and edit it. Now in most cases the amount of resources and effort that would be required to do so would probably not be worth it which would mean that it wouldn't be worth it to pirate, but i would be hesitant to say that it would be <i>impossible</i> to. Any deterministic system can be compromised the key is to make compromising it so difficult/expensive/time consuming that compromising it is not worth it.<p>Now from a practical stand point I don't know how well this would work in a consumer market, but can certainly see it being used in areas where protection of information is extremely important. It just seems a little to costly to implement on a wide scale to me, and I think consumers would see it as too invasive and resist it, so if there were alternatives in the marketplace I think a lot of people would opt for the alternative.",1363362151

It's not a case of how high or low something is, but where it is going to be relative to it's current place.<p>Press and Markets get this (the former to a lesser extent true) but the fear is that Apple have had their Halcyon days.  Originally Apple didn't need to worry about such issues as apps, they had the first phone device with a web browser that people really spoke about liking.  Heck they didn't even have GPS dispite most feature phones in the UK having it with maps.<p>A lot of analyists are asking, rightly so, why is Apple able to keep making such money, now the market is cramped.  Want a better camera, buy the 920, want a better screen? Buy the HTC, want a larger phone, buy the S4, want a smaller phone buy the. Hell I don't even know, but you get where I'm going with this.<p>The brand of the iPhone people fear to be falling.  In the old days of Windows 3.1 domination, the software took months to years to write.  Most of them now adays have little if anything more than weeks of platform specific code.  The <i>alternate</i> marketplace is huge, due to the size of the global market place.  Hell a friend was just telling me how he thinks he'll make a profit porting to the new blackberry, despite it having very low uptake here in London.<p>These notions lend people to conclude that what is currently happening with Apple might not be sustainable.  Gruber has been consistently wrong the last few months (in fact he is always as he predicts little but Apple growth) with regards to the decrease in share price and failure to develop new market share.<p>tldr; It might not be Apple vs Google.

5381082,comment,5355560,5355560,2,0,dmccunney,,,"Speaking personally, I never <i>left</i> Firefox.<p>I've been using Mozilla code since the Netscape 7.X days (and tried to use NS6, but it was way too buggy.)  I progressed from MS7 to the Mozilla Suite to Firefox, and have stayed there.<p>I have Chrome (and Opera, Safari, Midori, Konqueror, K-Meleon, D+, and a few other things including IE installed, but mostly to keep up on what others are doing.  Firefox is what I use in production, and I currently run Aurora (which will be the next release when it gets out of beta.)<p>FF isn't the smallest or fastest browser on the machine I'm on at the moment (and old netbook) but is the most capable.  FF, like other current browsers, makes assumptions about what you will run it on, and assumes a reasonably current machine with a reasonable CPU, GPU, and amount of RAM.  I have another old machine I don't even <i>try</i> to run FF on.<p>My reasons are tied up in the architecture.  FF uses the Gecko engine, like everything else Mozilla puts out.  Aside from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Gecko interprets and renders XUL, an XML language for designing user interfaces.  The look and feel of FF is determined by XUL, CSS, and widgets, and the browser is simply an instance of something Gecko renders.<p>This makes it possible to create themes that change what FF looks like, and extensions that modify and extend what it does, and that power is why I use it.  My RSS reader, IRC client and several other things that would ordinarily be external programs are implemented in FF as extensions.  Since the browser is always running when I'm at the computer, this make things very convenient.<p>Other browsers like Chrome added an extension capability, but they are pure JavaScript and limited by what the device API will let you do in JavaScript.  Half of what I do in FF isn't <i>possible</i> in Chrome.<p>Chrome is a worthy browser, and I'm glad it's there, but it's not what I use.  It invokes somewhat faster than FF, but page rendering is equivalent, and memory usage rises rapidly as you add extensions, so there's little difference between FF and Chrome in use.  Faster invocation is a non-issue here: I start the browser when I sit down at the machine and simply leave it running, so a few extra seconds to invoke it isn't a concern.  Too many people have the bad habit learned from IE of hopping in and out of the browser, and I just tell such folks ""You're doing it wrong"".<p>On my desktop booted into Windows, I run FF from a RAMdisk.  The desktop still runs XP and has 4GB RAM, but 32 bit Windows can only use 3.2GB of it.  I found a RAMdisk driver that can use the rest and have a 768MBR ramdrive seen as Z:.  Firefox, its cache, and its profile all live there and FF is run from there.  It's <i>quick</i>.  (Batch files populate the ramdisk on start up, and store the contents back to HD on shutdown.)  I don't believe I can <i>do</i> that with Chrome.",1363361317

Or is it? :)<p>A good part of the economic immigration today is from Africa, and they are a bit more educated and far more hard-working than one could believe (being a doctor in some African places is really not easy and you earn more washing a rich white man's dirty clothes). The problem with immigration in France seems more to have with second and third generations: kids born in France but that are not integrated in the society. They seem completely lost and without future and a lot of them evolve badly to either crime or religious extremism. If I had to point fingers, I would give a shared responsibility between public policies that have done nothing to integrate them (with school in suburbs filled with inexperienced teachers for example), racial prejudice and a lack of culture from the uneducated parents that are unable to show a good path to their kids.<p>Selective immigration is not so easy. If they really want to, people will come, eventually. If you put hurdles in their path, you only make their integration more difficult. Speaking of the Canadian example, I am in Canada right now, and my wife being a recruiter for a call center, she hires a lot of smart immigrants who actually hold the equivalent of a Master or even a PhD. Their diploma was given in France or another European country, but it is not recognized in Canada (it is often the case for medical professions which are very locked up in Quebec). Now these doctors and researchers call people to sell them washing machines or baby diapers. That's a waste.<p>Update: speaking of my wife and immigration, she is Romanian and had a lot of trouble finding a job in France, due to all the restrictions that Romanian nationals still suffer when they want to access the job market, and also her uncommon education path (she hold business degree from Romania and psychology degree for German university, which is great anywhere except in France when the culture of education is favoring people coming from one of the few elitist schools). \nOne of our main reason to move to Canada was our bet that it would be easier for her there, Canadian being more open to people like her. It proved right, and she got jobs very easily. That's a huge loss for France, because she is a very smart woman! :)",1363361028

But that's from a special property of noninteractive works, that one viewing is all there is to them. To copy-protect a program, in principle you could deliver it only to tamper-proof machines that self-destruct before giving up the code. You can't infer the program from its behavior, in general, unless P=NP (though of course you can do well enough for many programs; but black-box reverse engineering is more like creative work than scanning/recording). And releasing an app only for a particular platform is not a human-rights violation, at least not on the scale needed to suppress cameras and Turing machines.<p>That would take engineering beyond the current state of the art, but I know of no proof it can't be done, and at least one person I respect seems to think it can: <a href=""http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html#section04of05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html#section...</a><p>So ""DRM is impossible"" strikes me as short-sighted.

""There is no means of avoiding a final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion"".<p>We are in for a period of deflation despite the central banks' best efforts.  After the deflation, hyperinflation isn't out of the question if governments give up on credit money and just start spending freshly printed cash.",1260068051

979054,comment,978217,978633,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Hmm, good example I saw today - this was at Pike's Place Market in Seattle if anyone's interested. Very narrow street with slanted parking spaces. Guy was stopped waiting for someone to back out of a space (presumably so he can take the space). Guy behind completely oblivious, thinks guy ahead is just <i>stopped</i>, and starts honking like a madman.<p>Passerby goes up, bangs violently on the window, and proceeds the tell the guy to STFU, and generally being angry at the (admittedly clueless) driver. Shouting match ensues and almost gets physical.<p>One has to wonder why the passerby couldn't have knocked on the window and just calmly informed the driver that there was an obstruction ahead - this seems like it would've solved everyone's problems without any trouble.<p>Sure, the passerby was <i>correct</i> in that the driver was clueless, inconsiderate, and lacking in manners himself, but his approach was lacking in tact, and created more problems than it solved.",1260068031

You're answering a strawman that nobody raised - that somebody regrets etherpad getting sold and is now 'complaining' because they can't live without it.<p>1. This whole point is orthogonal to whether I paid for etherpad or not. Even if I paid for etherpad I'm just as screwed as everyone right now. You're telling me that if I didn't want to lose etherpad I should have paid for it <i>and convinced a lot of other people to do so</i>.<p>2. Companies get acquired all the time because they realize they've run out of steam in the market. To blame 'you the market' for that is just ridiculous.<p>3. You're making an analogy with donation-ware. The argument makes sense when you say ""if you don't pay us we'll die and won't be able to serve you."" It's a lot less potent when mutated to ""if you don't pay us we'll sell for $10M and screw you over.""<p>4. Etherpad never even made the less potent argument. They never solicited pro accounts. They could have done what Pandora did a year ago - scream loudly that they were going to die. But they didn't.<p>So what was I the market supposed to do a) <i>if</i> it was that important to me, b) without knowing etherpad needed money, c) if etherpad even considered this option?<p>I'll repeat, all anybody wants is more warning so we can migrate out what workflows we've created. And etherpad seems to have allowed new pads today, so I really don't have any complaints. Except with your argument :)",1260066138

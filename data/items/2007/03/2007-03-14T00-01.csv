Amazon's is called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and it seems like it might be a good alternative to a VPS -- the elasticity of each instance would be a boon to a quickly growing web service.<p>I am currently developing my startup's software on a dedicated server running FreeBSD, and I am paying some attention to making it so it will scale (probably in a load balanced cluster). <p>To this end, I have set up FreeBSD jails (low overhead chrooted full installs) so that I can test splitting up the application in various ways.<p>I would imagine that a transparent grid system would reduce the need to worry about scalability issues for many uses.",1173833882

They know that if the fund performs well, they look like a genius, yet if it fails, the poor college students and retirees are left holding the bag.<p>The whole economy has a huge moral hazard problem.  There's a reason why John Nash won a Nobel Prize.",1173833876

4029,comment,3795,3864,0,0,jward,,,"Django makes it very easy to have something working up and running right away and has a fair number of advantages that go along with it.  After looking over languages and frameworks it is what I've picked to write any future web app in.  I've yet to see anything more compelling.  <p>A nice tutorial and walk through is a good way to get your feet wet with a framework and language.  You have to build a site using something and have to start somewhere.  Because of Django, and lack of sleep, imageboard.net was up and working in a single weekend.  It's worth checking out.",1173832943

4027,comment,3865,3865,0,0,jward,,,"I still go for dead tree on most subjects I'm interested in.  I rarely read them all the way through however.  For me they're mostly meditative aids that help me sort out my thoughts when I run into a wall.<p>When I'm stuck I can only bang my head against the problem for so long until I get frustrated.  Having a dead tree version lets me completely leave the computer behind.  Reading about anything related helps my mind reorganize and regroup.  After an hour or so with my nose in a book I have at minimum an idea of something new to try.<p>Also, the book store I go to is in the same building Bioware was based out for many years.  It's just a reminder to me of success that was born just a few blocks from me.",1173832033

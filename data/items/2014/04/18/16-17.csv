7610004,comment,7602740,7603092,3,0,nostrademons,,,"This seems to always be the case - people turn on <i>neighboring</i> socioeconomic classes, not the ones at the extreme top of the pyramid.  During the Jim Crow era, the worst discrimination against blacks came not from the elite (many of whom had been abolitionists during slavery and equality-minded liberals afterwards), but from poor white sharecroppers who were one degree removed from slavery themselves.  Nowadays, the conservative movement within the U.S. is composed of the ultra-wealthy plus the lower-middle-class and working-class Religious Right.  The targets of the LA race riots were not rich white people, but Korean shopkeepers in minority neighborhoods.<p>I suspect it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s generally impossible to &quot;skip&quot; social classes and jump directly from the bottom to the top.  Even rags-to-riches stories usually involved a period of a few decades where the person enters and assimilates into the intervening classes.  Jan Koum went from immigrant to middle-class tech worker to aspiring entrepreneur to multi-billionaire.  Henry Ford went from farmer to machinist to engineer to captain of industry.  Andrew Carnegie went from immigrant to bobbin boy to telegraph operator to bookkeeper & investor to steel magnate.<p>As a result, each class views the class directly above them as their impediment to upwards mobility, and they&#x27;re not wrong in that belief.  In times of scarcity, resentment usually flows upwards to their immediate neighbors.  The more distant causes of the socioeconomic structures that hold people down are effectively invisible to the rioting classes; all they see is people who are not very different from themselves doing better than them.",1397840359

So if the United States initially objects to a new type of aircraft doing overflights, it is simply exercising its rights under the treaty. This is an issue for international negotiation by diplomats. As in most matters of diplomacy, how the specific issues are resolved in this review will be determined in part by what each side has to offer the other in terms of reciprocity--does the United States get to fly enhanced aircraft over the territory of other countries, or not?<p>&quot;Article V<p>&quot;AIRCRAFT DESIGNATION<p>&quot;1. Each State Party shall have the right to designate as observation aircraft one or more types or models of aircraft registered by the relevant authorities of a State Party.<p>&quot;2.

Observation flights shall be conducted using observation aircraft that have been designated by a State Party pursuant to Article V.

In the event that the observing Party provides the observation aircraft, it shall have the right to provide an aircraft that it has itself designated or an aircraft designated by another State Party. In the event that the observed Party provides the observation aircraft, the observing Party shall have the right to be provided with an aircraft capable of achieving a minimum unrefuelled range, including the necessary fuel reserves, equivalent to one-half of the flight distance, as notified in accordance with paragraph 5, subparagraph(G) of this Section.<p>. . . .<p>&quot;Article VIII<p>&quot;PROHIBITIONS, DEVIATIONS FROM FLIGHT PLANS AND EMERGENCY SITUATIONS<p>&quot;SECTION I.

7609952,comment,7609556,7609796,14,0,jerf,,,"They&#x27;re basically unrelated. The actor paradigm is basically imperative programming, with boundaries being put up between the actors, and the way you cross the boundary is with a message. If that sounds too foreign, bear in mind that while OO doesn&#x27;t have to be an &quot;Actor&quot; and an actor doesn&#x27;t have to be &quot;OO&quot;, they share a certain structural similarity, in that one of the primary characteristics of working with an &quot;object oriented&quot; system is that you are creating imperative islands of code, and the way you cross the barriers are via method calls. Indeed back when OO was first being formulated you can see the terminology was not settled yet, and you&#x27;ll see method calls being called &quot;messages&quot; even today in some OO communities.<p>The Actor model is basically OO, except that objects are given their own execution contexts, whereas in OO there&#x27;s one execution context that drives the objects. You can do worse for your first design in Erlang than to break your task into core objects exactly as you would for a high-level OO design (don&#x27;t put in all the little collection and iterator and other structure classes, stick to the &quot;high level&quot; design), and use that to drive your process design. It won&#x27;t be perfect, but it&#x27;s not a bad first pass. The profound differences between one execution context and multiple also has subsequent follow-on effects on the languages in question, and in what direction they evolve, so in practice they feel quite different despite the underlying similarities in the model.<p>Reactive programming is extremely different. There, values are defined as functions on other values, intrinsically, such that if A is B + C, future changes to B and C mean that A is automatically updated to the new B + C with no programmer interaction. This is no longer imperative design; instead of your program consisting of a huge set of instructions for the processor to directly execute (no matter how gussied up that is by the syntax and semantics of the local language), your program consists of a declaration of relationships between values and how they evolve over time. The fundamental operation of the programming language is no longer &quot;Set value identified by X to Y&quot;, but &quot;Attach value X to value Y with update function Z&quot;.<p>As is always the case in the world of Turing Completeness, this can be embedded into OO, or OO can be embedded into it, etc. all sorts of combinations are possible. But it is a fundamentally different underlying method for writing your program.<p>I would observe that A: this isn&#x27;t new, which I say not because anyone is claiming that it is but because it means that we can in fact draw on past experience to examine it and B: our general experience with it up to this point is that it often makes small tasks easier, even <i>much</i> easier, but that trying to create whole systems this way is often quite problematic. If you think laziness in Haskell is hard to understand, just wait until you&#x27;re trying to understand a cyclic dependency graph in a data-binding environment (the usual OO manifestation) or a spreadsheet, with the local bizarre adaptations to try to make that sensible all interacting with each other in crazy complicated ways. It&#x27;s a useful tool, and I don&#x27;t mean that as a mere rhetorical sop, it really <i>is</i> a useful tool to have in the belt, but I&#x27;m deeply skeptical of it as a proclaimed savior of programming, or the Next Big Paradigm. Our experiences with it up to this point have not been positive enough to justify that claim, IMHO, and I haven&#x27;t seen that there&#x27;s been any sort of big enough change in the landscape lately to justify that.<p>Compare to &quot;functional programming&quot;, which has been the Next Big Paradigm for a few decades now, but IMHO modern Haskell of the past 3-5 years really <i>is</i> a big enough advance to justify some examination on the topic. (I&#x27;m <i>not</i> saying Haskell is guaranteed to be the Next Big Thing, I&#x27;m just saying that there&#x27;s been enough action there to legitimately justify having a fresh look at the situation.)<p>If you can point me at the big advance for reactive programming in question, I&#x27;d love to have a look.

Intuitively, I tend to compartmentalize dataflow along with maps, filters and comprehensions; and actors with FSMs. This is probably an incorrect generalization, but it works for me.<p>Somewhere, Hoare gives an example of pipelining the sieve of Eratosthenes through a series of communicating processes, which is a good example of dataflow programming -- you send a list of integers to a process that sieves out even numbers and sends the result to a process that sieves out multiples of 3, and so on. Such a pipeline is deterministic -- given a set of values, you will always get the same output -- and compositional -- the sum of the sieves is greater than the individual parts.<p>A traditional actor-based model, on the other hand, isn&#x27;t well-suited for that kind of problem, but is <i>great</i> if your goal is to dispense biscuits and chocolates. State is kept locally, and the actor can change its behavior to external messages based on internal state -- that is to say, actors have discrete identities. The response to any particular message is nondeterministic, because it depends on what&#x27;s the actor&#x27;s internal state and decision process may be, and you can&#x27;t really combine multiple vending machines to compose a new, super-vendor.",1397839717

They do things you just wouldn&#x27;t think possible because of how much they push themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen what is described in the top article of this blog.

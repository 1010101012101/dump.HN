You are really underselling how much it sucks to be poor.<p>> All the money in the world won&#x27;t prevent you or a loved one from passing due to an untreatable illness.<p>Death of a family member is much more likely to happen if you are poor. Too bad you can&#x27;t afford that unreasonably expensive surgery.<p>> All the money in the world won&#x27;t buy you friends or genuine respect.<p>This is such a first world concern. Boo hoo. Also, yes, money does buy friends. When my family went bankrupt most of our friends turned their backs on us. This is a common occurrence. Ask a homeless person what happened to their &quot;friends&quot; when push came to shove.<p>> It can&#x27;t buy you love (though it can buy you sex).<p>Not being poor is more important than finding love. If you want love, have some kids, and love them.<p>> Furthermore, you don&#x27;t need to be rich to avoid the hardship of being poor, you just have to make a sufficient amount to afford quality housing, food, health insurance, and minor luxuries.<p>Please do not underestimate how hard it is for those who are actually poor to &quot;make a sufficient amount.&quot;<p>This seems like a good enough time as any to point out that there are like six empty houses for every homeless person in America.

7991367,comment,7989490,7989854,3,0,jrockway,,,"Indeed, the goal of DRM is to transfer the liability to someone else.  If you make a product that plays back DRM&#x27;d content, you don&#x27;t want to get sued when someone figures out how to use your system to pirate stuff.  So you ask the copyright holder what to do, and they say &quot;buy solution XXX that&#x27;s already approved&quot;, and then you do.  Then you&#x27;re happy, because you don&#x27;t get sued, the chip manufacturer is happy, because you have to buy their chips (and whatever other fun add-ons you may need for your product) from them, and the copyright holder is happy, because the chip company&#x27;s lawyers convinced their lawyers that nobody can pirate stuff.<p>Meanwhile, it all works because nobody cares to break your DRM because audio is already widely distributed in lossless DRM-free formats (CDs), and Blu-Ray DRM is already broken.  The pirates don&#x27;t want Netflix&#x27;s 5Mbps stream when they can just buy a Blu-Ray and get a 50Mbps copy instead.  (Similarly, they don&#x27;t want Spotify&#x27;s Vorbis stream because they can just source material from the uncompressed CD.)<p>(Piracy works because it&#x27;s a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_cow_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_cow_problem</a>)",1404549782

So far, there haven&#x27;t been any viable options when it comes to &quot;full-stack&quot; IaaS service providers here (except Profitbricks maybe, which doesn&#x27;t even come close to AWS in terms of functionality or pricing though), so I&#x27;m really excited to see Amazon entering this market.<p>Of course the problem remains that Amazon is a US company and thereby required to cooperate with US authorities and hand them over customer data if requested, so some businesses might still not want to host their data there. Still, I&#x27;m excited that they&#x27;re finally coming to Germany \n!",1404547909

And among these hard-working people other factors start to decide again, and a very important factor is talent.<p>So if you compare yourself to the guy who watches TV all day, of course hard work is the main thing. But if you compare yourself to fellow enterpreneurs, Phd studentst, hackers with great github repositories, or guys who work long hours at their workplace to advance, who maybe does not watch TV at all, talent matters.",1404547858

All right.<p>But we don&#x27;t need to cast failures and flaws as the result of &quot;high intelligence&quot;. Just a few days ago we had an article about the &quot;curse of smart people&quot;. It feels like a bunch of people patting themselves on the back and telling themselves &quot;oh, we&#x27;re so intelligent, this is why we failed&quot;.<p>If intelligent people are so prone to failure, what is the purpose of measuring intelligence? Being stupid is bad, being average is bad, now being smart is also bad! Congratulations.<p>Part of the problem is the ease at which we proclaim ourselves &quot;very intelligent&quot;. Being good at school is not a sure sign of high intelligence - school is an artificial environment that values short-term memorizing of facts, over critical analysis and independent decision-making. You won&#x27;t go far in life with that, but maybe you&#x27;ll do well in quiz TV shows. Solving &quot;missing piece&quot; puzzles also isn&#x27;t a sign of high intelligence. All those are just a small part of it.<p>Can&#x27;t we agree &quot;intelligent&quot; is the skill of <i>setting good goals</i>, <i>achieving them</i>, and making <i>good decisions</i> in light of limited facts, limited time, and some stress, because <i>that&#x27;s what life is</i>, and move on to strive (and possibly measure) for that.",1404547791

4352843,comment,4350838,4352747,1,0,Jach,,,"It's only n-factor if you have n orthogonal keys. Typically ""something you know"", ""something you have"", and ""something you are"". In the same sense that two passwords isn't ""2-factor"", I wouldn't say that a finger print + DNA sample is ""2-factor"". The problem with ""something you are"" as a third factor is that it typically requires you to have some hardware to get that information, in which case it's just 2-factor again. And if we get the technology to read out brain dumps, knowing a password is just a part of something you are and we're back to 1-factor... Which suggests it's not the number of factors that are important, but the total number of bits of information involved and how hard it is for theoretical attackers to gather all those bits. Is your scheme torture-proof? I doubt anyone would prefer torture over handing over their phone+password to their gmail account. But most attackers aren't going to come torture you. A phone or a yubikey or what have you is immune to OS keyloggers which defeat passwords of any complexity, that alone makes them useful against a big class of attackers. What class of attackers does e.g. a thumbprint further defeat? It sounds like it's more useful as a reset verification than anything else--you can forget your password and lose your phone but you don't lose your thumb--usually. (We can also get the 'mark of the beast' and have chips implanted in our hands.)",1344380355

4352837,comment,4352290,4352290,14,0,ilaksh,,,"The biggest problem I have with this sort of thing -- actually probably the whole field(s) of UI/UX design -- is that there is no actual prototype but it seems like they are implying that the programmers didn't include any of those features because they didn't think of them, and that now the real work for the 'redesign' has been done.  As if the hard part was making a bunch of pictures.<p>So this whole thing really irritates me.<p>Having said that, I think that modernizing Wikipedia or MediaWiki is a an interesting idea (although probably not a priority), and this is actually a decent starting point for discussing how many of the new (mainly, but not entirely, stylistic) UI/UX trends (principles in a few cases I guess) could be applied.<p>I mean obviously their nav takes up more space than necessary and we don't need Wikipedia's logo to look just like WordPress's, but the minimalism, alternate typography of some sort, monochrome icon widgets, etc. are apparently now required in order to qualify as contemporary design.  And the connection clouds and highlighter quote idea is cool.  And it probably wouldn't hurt to remove one or two of the buttons on the editor or move them to an advanced section, or spend an hour or two making the editor looking more contemporary.<p>In case anyone actually reads this, I have a question.  Is the thing where buttons and controls are monochrome icons (and usually with no 3d appearance), is that going to stay?  I mean, is there a reason you can't have multiple colors in icons now?  Also it seems a lot of times you don't get labels on buttons anymore (I know, tooltips).  How much of this stuff is likely to stick for the next 5, 10 years, or is it just a short term fad?  I mean I coded a UI recently for a component platform thing I am building (actual functional software platform, not pictures) and it had multicolor traditional icons on normal 3d buttons with labels.  This UX guy saw that and said I was 'completely out of touch'.  So I took the labels, 3d and colors off the buttons.",1344380292

Someone who hasn't spent years of their life driving manually won't have developed the skills to intervene properly in an emergency. At best, driving would, become a specialty career/hobby, like piloting aircraft.<p>By the time all personal transportation is automatic, it won't just be the status quo with ""robot chauffeurs"".

If you know how to build a car, you will be an expert at building cars, not driving them. I mean, how many of the better racing drivers are builders themselves?<p>If you always have to think about the how, the expression and the art suffers. Always.

4352832,comment,4352290,4352782,39,0,firemanx,,,"I think it already delights users.  Wikipedia is so absolutely content and hyperlink driven that it hardly needs much else.  It's immense popularity and ubiquity is proof of that.  I draw my delight not from some invasive graphics and UI work, but from the fact that when I want to read about Pyramids, I click a link on Google to Pyramids (or on the Wikipedia front page) and ALL I SEE IS PYRAMIDS.  No other UI, no other stuff to interfere with what I'm trying to do.  And from there, I click hyperlinks and quickly jump from Pyramids to Ancient Engineering to Trigonometry to the various mathematicians who have improved on the work the Egyptians did.<p>The delight is in the speed at which I can quickly explore and consume human knowledge.  Nothing I've seen in terms of graphical suggestions would improve that - only distract or prevent my friends in other countries from being able to use it properly.<p>To me, Wikipedia is embodiment of ""less is more"", which supposedly all of these hotshot designers are supposed to subscribe to, but apparently mistranslate it to ""a metric butt-load of negative space"".",1344380210

If it was an obscure or specialist book you might have to drive to a different town. You might just be shit out of luck. Nowadays you search for the title on Amazon and it shows up at your door the next morning. When you are done you can sell it again on Amazon with minimal hassle. Amazon improved the efficiency and liquidity of the book market which is why they are rich, even though they are  charging less overhead than the bookstores.<p>Your local corner store doesn't create anything.

It's not like google existed in its magnitude back then or even mozilla. Back then there wasn't much stability either i.t.o market leaders (if I remember correctly netscape escaped roundabout that time and opera didn't have much market stake).<p>If you check IE 9 developer tools, you can't even 'switch back' to IE 6 anymore (well, atleast not in x64 mode).<p>There's a reason why you should opt to use 'cross-browser' libraries such as jQuery. Google chrome has a couple of bugs and even firefox. Not all problems have solutions - take for example styling of 'web' controls. IE renders native controls, browsers render their specific controls - some allow text-indent while others don't.<p>In terms of application development - as far as I know all non .NET tools have pretty much be phased out (ie. VB6 etc.).<p>You essentially face the same problem to some degree (ex. users that still run with IE 6 are probably like to be running .NET 2.0 or none at all).<p>I think at the moment Microsoft is opting for cross-platform apps via web and wcf/web api services. You can also use Mono, but it's generally at least one major version behind (couple of years) and doesn't fully support everything the .NET framework does.<p>When talking about 'cross-platform' apps, people are rather quick to forget that applications are written during certain time periods. It's easy to support users who are using 10 year old software/hardware (ex. windows xp 32) with 10 year old software (.NET 1.0).<p>I reckon it's about the same effort to force a user to install 'open source' libraries such as open-gtk as it is to force the user to use a different browser or install the .NET framework if they're on windows.<p>I'm actually hoping that all the legacy windows operating systems get upgraded to Windows 8 when it gets released. Microsoft is running a campaign where you pay 30$ or something to upgrade a Windows XP+ OS to Windows 8. Windows 8 also boasts quite a bit of improved performance and less resource usage - which makes it perfect for all that legacy hardware (I reckon most PCs built the last 12 years should be able to run it). This would also pave the path to better HTML standards support with IE 10 and better .NET framework support (4.5).<p>In regards to the tools - I reckon if you're going a C#.NET route with professional+ visual studio with other addons, then I'd say the dev environment greatly surpasses that from what I've seen on linux (visual studio pro ~ $400 USD, addons are free and priced - I use resharper, mindscape web workbench and tangible t4 daily).<p>You could always go Java route if you don't like the .NET framework.",1344378259

5927906,comment,5927181,5927484,11,0,bilbo0s,,,"Uhh...<p>An underground railroad would be a serious proposition. UR was a nasty... and noble... group of people who were perfectly willing to go MUCH further than the authorities or the slave catchers.<p>I&#x27;ll give an example, Pinkerton, though it was probably not generally known at the time, was a white operative in this organization. Now after the Civil War, we get some idea of the tactics that Pinkerton and his &quot;coworkers&quot; got up to in the UR.<p>For instance, when Pinkerton was sent after The James Gang, who he hated, as he saw the James family as slavers AND traitors... he went and threw incendiary devices into the James home. We know now that he fully intended to burn the home down, and probably intended to kill James&#x27; mother. The US Government had to call the Pinkertons off.<p>Would WikiLeaks or a &quot;WikiArmy&quot; be willing to use such tactics? I doubt it.<p>Another example, the Spanish government hired Pinkerton to help in dealing with a revolution [in Cuba] that intended abolition and suffrage. Six months later... the Cuban abolitionists came to power. So deceit on that level was not beyond the capabilities of the UR.<p>I&#x27;m not sure WikiLeaks has this level of capability.<p>They were also quiet. Extremely quiet. Underground railroad was not even the name of the organization... it&#x27;s just the name the American public gave it when it became clear that SOMETHING must have been going on. So these guys were so quiet and disciplined for the time that no one even knew what the organization was called. Or even who was in it, or relative ranks.<p>I just mention this because a great deal is known about WikiLeaks... so I&#x27;m not sure they would make a good underground railroad.<p>Also, the UR was willing to sacrifice much more than their opponents. Consider, blacks would generally be willing to sacrifice MANY blacks to protect the identity of a white operative... who were more valuable to the blacks for obvious reasons.<p>Does WikiLeaks or Anonymous have an in-built group of soldiers whose loyalty is without question? Who would be willing to endure great pain or even death to keep its secrets?<p>I&#x27;m just saying... these people are so imitated because they were VERY effective at what they did. They LITERALLY used sex and murder if it suited their ends. They wrote books, music and news to shape public opinion. But all of that was just for starters... They also destabilized economies! And the overthrow of governments was not ruled out as a means of accomplishing their objectives. Most importantly, these people had a proven capability to actually accomplish any of those missions!<p>Sound familiar?<p>It should... the UR was, in a very real way, the precursor to the Union&#x27;s intelligence service during the war. Even after the war... I mean it was Pinkerton who founded the Secret Service! The OSS is the UR&#x27;s great grandchild, so the CIA is part of that lineage as well. Pinkerton&#x27;s methods, the UR&#x27;s methods, still inform investigation and intelligence gathering and even counter intel and insurgency today.<p>Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I&#x27;m sure SOME clicktivists are willing to go as far as the black runaways and Northern whites were...<p>What I am NOT certain of, is whether ANY clicktivists are willing to ENDURE as much as the UR was willing to endure in the pursuit of its goals.",1372001700

Governments, for some weirdo reason, think that no one should have need for privacy, if they are decent lawful people. Despite individuals in government insisting on personal privacy for them selves.<p>What bothers me is that the more we use systems to protect our selves, the more governments will become paranoid because they may not be able to monitor us to reassure them selves that we are not up to no good. This could well make them react by telling the mass population that &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;criminals&quot;, might as well bung &quot;pedophiles&quot; in there too, are communicating &quot;securely&quot;. We will prove their paranoia, give them the evidence they can twist and use. It will become more and more twisted, with the whole thing artificially ratcheting up. This seems to be how governments do things these days.<p>However, perhaps the severe danger government face is that privacy may catch on. Imagine if people begin to default to the most secure methods they can get. Simple add-ons that enforce using HTTPS where available, browsers that block tracking, more secure email, and so on. Might not be robust and perfect, but the internet would see more and more traffic definable as &quot;secure&quot;. As this goes on, these secure services will become faster, easier, and more secure, enabling more and more people to be easily secure. Worse still, the software would become independent and open sourced for verification. In the end, even the NSA should have difficulty keeping up and cracking the security. The more data that is encrypted, the more data they will feel they have to keep.<p>Dunno quite where I am going with this, but I reckon that by aggressively spying on mass population government is making their own job much harder in the long run. It could force the internet and communications in general to become secure beyond their capabilities to crack. Then all that is left is blackmailing people to give up keys with threats of prison, or worse.",1372000873

What you lead an article with serves as the context for the rest of the story and is the part that&#x27;s most likely to color the reader&#x27;s judgment. Also, most people only skim the first part of an article; the abandonment rate drops precipitously with every passing paragraph, which is why you put the most important things first, and the least important things last. This idea is succinctly conveyed by the literary maxim: don&#x27;t bury the lede.<p>It&#x27;s really not a paranoid interpretation. It&#x27;s well known you can sway a reader&#x27;s view on a topic by the order information is presented, and being aware of this tactic is useful for thinking critically about a news story.

However, post-factum, it seems very natural thing to do - I might probably do it if/when I ever interview for a position where it is relevant (though I might just bring a tablet in and show some code in opensource repose).

To the right kind of startup, time is everything and they will pay good money for someone they think of as an asset who will demonstrably help them execute.<p>I am guessing here - but it simply sounds like you are coming to the table with the wrong attitude. &quot;Please sir, give me some dev work&quot;. Well, under these circumstances you will of course be treated as &quot;just&quot; another outsourced programmer.<p>Don&#x27;t be like that. Be a partner. Turn up in a suit. Show your business savvy, list your successes, and matter-of-factly tell them that they are excited about their plans, you can likely help them achieve their execution goals, and your rate is £600/day (or more). Give them your business card and tell them to call you when they&#x27;re ready to start. You&#x27;re a pro, you can and will manage yourself, and you will deliver - you&#x27;re not a teenager looking for a part-time job.<p>Startups aren&#x27;t really interested in bargaining over your hourly rate. They want to execute! Frankly, they are bargaining you down only because you allow them to. That obviously means you are selling the wrong thing. Instead, make them understand that you are the guy who is going to take ownership of their mobile app and help them get it out by the end of next month. Now you&#x27;re not an outsourced programmer, you&#x27;re a partner consultant who takes ownership and has real commitment. Your rates double. Try it.<p>And of course, once you make that promise and gain those rates, you gotta deliver!",1382144082

It was prevalent because it was trivial to port, not because it was good.<p>(Note that UCSD Pascal was based on a part of Wirths research groups &quot;porting kit&quot; - their intent was not for p-code to be used for production systems, but as an easy way of getting a Pascal compiler running on a new platform to be able to then use the target platform while retargeting the code generator)<p>> It had to be implemented contrary to beliefs common then: it was itself written in asm,<p>That was nothing out of the ordinary at the time, though not something Wirth himself did, as a large part of his mission was to teach the development of compilers.<p>But compilers for small systems were often written in asm at the time. It&#x27;d not be very viable to write compilers in high level languages for a C64 or other home computers, for example, yet there were plenty of compilers for small systems. When I wrote my first compilers on the C64 and a bit later on the Amiga, it never even occurred to me to write them in a high level language until a few years later (incidentally when I got HiSoft Pascal - an integrated Pascal environment for the Amiga very much in the spirit of Turbo Pascal)<p>> it was never just a compiler but the editor and compiler at once, kept everything in memory if it could, produced the pure native code processor specific and never produced obj files.<p>That&#x27;s <i>technically</i> true, though the compiler that became Turbo Pascal was actually originally a separate, stand alone compiler.<p>Combining the compiler with the editor <i>was</i> fairly uncommon and certainly innovative. When Kahn at Borland decided he wanted an environment like that, though, he went out and bought an existing, standalone, commercial compiler, from Anders Hejlsberg, and brought him to Borland.<p>Producing pure native code on the other hand was not unusual - UCSD&#x27;s p-System was an aberration in that respect, and it&#x27;s greatest lasting legacy was in inspiring VM based systems; e.g. Bill Joy has cited it as one of the inspirations behind the JVM. Not producing object files was also quite common - for many small systems there was no tradition of object files at all, as they were too small for separate compilation to make much sense.",1382143306

Most gamers would prefer to have the most fps possible at any given moment, even if it means variability.<p>The most hardcore gamers I know use 120hz monitors, and machines that can deliver 241fps (120 * 2 + 1) in the highest detail scenes.  They then set the engine to cap frames at 241fps which will eliminate tearing, negating the need for this technology.

I can resonate a lot with what your friend Nate said over the course of my &quot;writing career&quot; if you can call it that. So, well done.<p>For me, I&#x27;m a written communicator at heart, so looking at a comment box or a journal and willing a series of letters to form words that represent what I would like to articulate isn&#x27;t an activity that&#x27;s <i>generally</i> hard for me. But there&#x27;s something about the mental block of preparing something for publication on a blog that changes the game in my head. Perhaps it&#x27;s the effect my college English professor had on me, but blogging feels like I&#x27;m preparing to submit a paper to him for grading, which is good. They taught me how to evaluate my own work critically and how to assimilate and process feedback. When I&#x27;m in that mode, I do that.<p>But something they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> do was ever give me a 100 on a paper. The point of this was simple: <i></i>no draft is perfect, not even the final draft<i></i>. And the important thing that I walked away with is that imperfection is ok.<p>If I could expound on what Nate said in the blog post, I&#x27;d emphasize the lesson I summarized above on imperfection. All too often, I catch myself measuring myself against other writers. Then when I&#x27;m reading drafts of something I&#x27;m preparing, it&#x27;s too easy for me to get into the snare of saying &quot;this isn&#x27;t as good as so-and-so&#x27;s post, so I shouldn&#x27;t publish it.&quot; And I have to beat myself over the head and remind myself that imperfection is ok.<p>Imperfect writings have started and ended wars, communicated heartfelt feelings from one lover to another, and sometimes brought about common understanding where there was none. And in all likelihood, whoever &quot;so-and-so&quot; is at any given time, if they&#x27;re a writer worth their body weight they probably thought their blog post was imperfect in some way too.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s just my 2 cents on what could have been added.

A fair proportion of the general population are not numerate enough to add £1.99 and £1.99. If these are in your target market and you find that ethically OK, you may be profiting from that. [<i>Edited to add: sum deliberately chosen from experience; coincidentally matches article data</i>]<p>* &quot;Random&quot; prices such as 86p can give a psychological sense that you have cut off as much as you can (even if you really haven&#x27;t), attracting savvy shoppers, as long as you have a reasonably trustworthy brand on this point.<p>* Pricing even a penny or two less than the competition will attract price sensitive customers, particularly online. A lot of the general population are indeed price sensitive and are able to compare prices thanks to the internet. This depends on whether your level of service is perceived as reasonably comparable/fungible.<p>* Round prices e.g. £100,000 can give a sense of luxury or quality - you are not discounting because you are providing a high value product. Discounting often undermines any perception of quality - it&#x27;s plausible that you would make fewer sales at £99,999<p>* a few pence difference is a bigger hit on (much bigger percentage of) your retail profit margin than it is on the customer&#x27;s pocket. Research shows inconclusive results, and if it&#x27;s not costing you sales, you should probably not take off the pennies.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to compare this to the neighbour thread about developer rates - I doubt there are many developers charging £49.99 per hour [<i>Edited to add: it&#x27;s not even possible to select that as an option!</i>]",1382141325

The speed that the pixels can update is proportional to the amount of ghosting. Interestingly enough, it won&#x27;t eliminate it no matter how fast the pixels update. The real problem with ghosting turned out to be precisely the pixel-persistence. Even more interesting is that someone discovered a hack for the modern 3D monitors like the ASUS mentioned that completely eliminates ghosting: the strobing backlight functionality necessary for 3D completely eliminates ghosting when applied to 2D.

So outbound traffic from the instance works to both IPv4 and IPv6.<p>For a simple instance, inbound traffic only works over IPv6.  That&#x27;s not really practical today, so there&#x27;s support for floating IPv4 addresses.  You can assign one IPv4 to an instance running a load balancer (haproxy, nginx), and then that uses IPv6 to talk to the backend instances.  That&#x27;s going to be documented within the week (I hope!)<p>Sadly, EC2 doesn&#x27;t support IPv6, so we use protocol 41 (which wraps IPv6 in IPv4 packets), giving each EC2 instance a 2002: address.  They can then talk to each other, or to other FathomCloud instances. They can talk to IPv6 servers that have a 2002: address configured.<p>Finally, most end-users don&#x27;t have IPv6 either.  There&#x27;s a trick using SSH and tunnels to give you a quick-and-easy VPN, so you can get onto IPv6 from any machine.  I&#x27;m going to blog about this, as it&#x27;s the easiest way to get IPv6 and you get a VPN for free.<p>So it&#x27;s a bit messy in the details, but with IPv4 floating IPs I think it all works.  Using a single floating IPv4 to a loadbalancer is &quot;the right thing to do&quot; anyway in a cloud webserver setup.  And I think it&#x27;s totally worth it to say goodbye to NAT forever!",1382140818

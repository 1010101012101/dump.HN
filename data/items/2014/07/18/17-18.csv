There&#x27;s not a lot of things or people that would survive being delivered in that manner.<p>> Is there some fundamental reason that makes this not work?<p>As covered elsewhere in the thread: cost (ICBMs aren&#x27;t cheap), fragility of most of the things you&#x27;d want to deliver (and most of the places to which you might want to deliver them), and the fact launching ICBMs is a good way to start a war?",1405706386

8054552,comment,8053032,8053032,4,0,adamtj,,,"That&#x27;s a lot of digits.<p>It would be interesting to interlace the latitude and longitude bits in such a way that any prefix is a valid code of reduced resolution, and you can add arbitrarily many digits for increased precision.  I think geohash does this?  Or does reducing precision give you a geohash that isn&#x27;t a prefix?  Anyway...<p>Each digit of such a code might be roughly equivalent to one decimal digit of both latitude and longitude. For example, maybe the first three digits would get you to within about a nautical mile.<p>But that&#x27;s dumb.  While short codes are nice, a short code that only gets you within a mile is mostly useless.  It would be better to use a suffix than a prefix.  You can still get arbitrary precision with a decimal point.<p>First, specify a fixed &quot;unit&quot; of precision.  Say 10m.  Any short code is assumed to be the least significant digits.  If my math is right, you could specify any point closer than 2 km +/- 10 m using maybe 2 digits.  Most buildings in most cities will need maybe 3-5 digits.<p>You could invite somebody from the same city to your house, telling them you live at YA9.  Their GPS would assume that the missing prefix digits match their current location.  If you want to give them the location of the centerpiece on your dining room table, you could add a decimal point and more precision: YA9.7R.<p>You could even use short-codes that look like Mapcodes:  US-DC, YA9.  The location provides the context for the missing prefix digits.  But you always have the option of specifing the full code to avoid ambiguity or lookup tables.<p>One problem is the check digit.  Maybe there&#x27;s a way to interlace the check bits too, so you don&#x27;t need a full check digit for every code.  Is there a checksum algorithm where a prefix of the checksum is a checksum of a prefix?  That obviously couldn&#x27;t detect a one-digit typo.  Or, maybe just put a check digit at end.  All codes become 2 digits minimum.  The checksum algorithm wouldn&#x27;t need to be fancy since you can assume the rest of the digits based on your current location.<p>Another easily fixed problem is mentioned on the Geohash wikipedia page: locations near the equator and prime meridian could have wildly different codes than other locations nearby.  The solution to that is easy: Translate lat/lon into a different system.  Translate latitude into a number from 0 to 180, with 0 being the south pole.  Similarly translate longitude to a number from 0 to 360, with 0 being at the international date line.  Then encode those translated numbers.  Nobody would ever see those intermediate numbers.  You always display either lat/lon or the code, but the translation ensures that you don&#x27;t have vastly different codes for nearby places (at least in any place with a significant number of people).",1405706345

We were introduced by a mutual friend and met at Google. Within a year of that meeting, Qasar put together a team, applied and successfully got into YC, and sold TalkBin to Google.<p>While at Google Qasar was one if the sharpest Product Managers on the team. I joined his team within a few weeks after the TalkBin acquisition. As the team, product, and scope grew, Qasar focused on building excellent product, never compromising quality. As a result he quickly rose the ranks because of his unique ability to balance product and business objectives. All the while he took great care of the people on his team.<p>It&#x27;s truly sad to see him leave Google but he will be an incredible force of nature at YC. His passion and energy has always been on helping startups and founders succeed. He spent a tremendous amount of time mentoring and coaching his team at Google and will bring this same enthusiasm to YC. Above all else, Qasar is the quintessential example of someone that has more grit than anyone I know.<p>He&#x27;s a no bullshit kind of person that&#x27;s always helping getting things done. YC is very fortunate to have him. Even if you are not in his batch, Qasar is someone you want to get to know.",1405706269

Within the first 3 months, I had no more vacation, no more sick days, and just 15 days of PTO.  Note the mathematical inequality.  We were, of course, then required to use PTO days when the office was shuttered due to dangerous weather, and everyone got the flu because no one wanted to scuttle their own summer vacation plans by staying home sick in February.<p>My experience is that American companies hate the idea that their employees might prefer to do anything at all other than to make more money for the company than it costs to pay out their benefits and wages.  This is not a theoretical hate, but an actual, almost tangible hate.  They are completely furious that their inefficient meat-robots continually whine about needing to eat, sleep, and eliminate wastes.  Never mind wanting to actually <i>leave</i> the workplace.<p>US companies emphatically do not offer 4 weeks PTO to new hires.  You would be lucky to get that after 5 years of continuous employment with the same company.  Your mileage, of course, may vary, especially if you are in a particularly labor-friendly job market.  My personal experience, however, is that I have never been able to take a vacation longer than 9 continuous days, and those were often constrained by weekends and paid holidays, resulting in 4 days spent from PTO, and 5 days from weekends and holidays.<p>I would be willing to put up with some of the negative aspects of having a union, if it could manage even as much as stopping my non-paycheck benefits from eroding a tiny bit every year.

8054358,comment,8052702,8052702,2,0,geebee,,,"I do think we need to completely separate the need for immigration reform from the notion that there is, specifically, a shortage of scientists and engineers.  I think the case for more liberal general skilled immigration is vastly stronger than the case for worker-sponsored visa programs designed to remedy an alleged shortage of STEM workers - however, the second is much more appealing to the short term interests of private corporations.<p>At my core, I am generally opposed to ever granting a private corporation the power to bestow US residency or a green card on a individual, and I&#x27;m actually suspicious of allowing universities to do this as well.  I think a corporation should offer a job, and a university should offer a degree.  This way, the markets will correct if the job or degree is not attractive to people with the freedom to choose (say, dentistry or pharmacy school over a master&#x27;s degree in structural engineering, an MS in nursing rather than an MS in computer science).  I also firmly believe that when non-government institutions acquire this power to bestow US residency, they use it as a crutch, and by delaying those market adjustments, delay the day of reckoning [1] to the point where high tech employers would be truly shocked by what it would take to draw highly talented people away from other fields.<p>One possible approach would be to abolish employer-sponsored work programs, but create a comparable number of spots for skilled immigrants.  STEM background counts, but is not given special consideration over other types of skilled workers (in Australia&#x27;s system, I believe a licensed plumber gets 60 points, an IT worker 40-60, depending on qualifications).<p>That said, controlling government is wildly profitable, and lobbying is one of the best returns on the dollar imaginable.  If high tech can profit by controlling the immigration system through their own <i>very</i> privately run HR departments, you can bet they&#x27;ll make every effort to do that.<p>[1] as an example, congress recently considered legislation to solve the shortage of Americans getting grad degrees in STEM fields (they excluded certain life sciences).  Think about what it takes to get a PhD from an elite program in engineering or physics.  Top grades in an extremely difficult undergraduate program, high GRE scores perhaps including a subject test, and survival in a graduate program with attrition rates between 33%-50%, with an average completion around 7 years!  Compare this to the process of becoming a dermatologist.  You need to get good grades and do premed, which is rigorous, but not as rigorous as majoring in Physics or many other STEM majors.  You need to score high on a standardized test (that does require specific preparation and subject knowledge).  Graduation rates for UCSF medical school are above 99%, almost always in a predictable 4 years.  Residency for dermatology is 3-4 years - it&#x27;s completive,and you may not get it, but remember that we&#x27;re comparing this to PhD attrition rates of 50% in many fields.  Starting salaries are about 280,000 a year, and go way up as you gain experience, 45 isn&#x27;t considered &quot;old&quot; at all, and the average dermatologist works a little more than a 40 hour work week. So, what would it take to get a student who is equally interested in both fields to want to do a PhD in Physics instead of becoming a dermatologist? This is the kind of sticker shock employers may be looking at.",1405704698

It is a safe bet that all of these Bitcoin are converted to USD immediately as part of the payment processing by someone like Coinbase.  The question is, can Coinbase sell these coins as quickly as they receive them?  If not, what kind of exposure do they have to the violatility of the price of Bitcoin?  Is that exposure high enough that these companies could be brought down by a drop in Bitcoin pricing and would that lead to a collapse of the Bitcoin economy (i.e. are any of these too big to fail)?",1405703756

I stayed in France and began dating a French girl who didn&#x27;t speak English at all -- so we had these weird intellectual/juvenile sounding conversations in the beginning - with me basically speaking confusing, garbled French 100% of the time. Point is, after about one month together with her, I understood spoken French very well, and could articulate some fairly complex thoughts.  It just felt like the language came crashing into my head once I had to &quot;articulate&quot; what needed to be articulated and &quot;hear&quot; what needed to be heard.  It&#x27;s one of the strangest feelings of immersive learning that I can remember. Like DonPellegrino mentioned, I never really cared about gender and proper grammar, because... when your girlfriend doesn&#x27;t know your language, you just have to force the thoughts out somehow. This might sound obvious, but if you have a partner who speaks another language fluently, just speak in your native tongue and ask them to speak in their native tongue.  From my experience, the most powerful part of learning a language is just &quot;slowing&quot; it down in your head.  You&#x27;d think you could just watch television to do this -- but in my experience (multiple languages now), you can&#x27;t.

It&#x27;s not great if you like driving, lots of personal space, fitting in, etc. Personally I find it almost entirely very agreeable. It&#x27;s such a homogeneous society that some things might depend on your background.<p>> particular career?<p>Miscellaneous web/front-end/content development; later tech evangelism.<p>> moving expenses?<p>Minimal, but that was ~15 years ago and I had very little stuff. I brought two suitcases and shipped a few boxes by sea. It was under $1K, perhaps half that.<p>> How much is your rent or did you buy?<p>Tokyo center is on par with downtown S.F. - i.e. egregious. But due to unbelievably never-want-to-leave public transport, you can live well outside the city comfortably. My rent is around $1300/mo; commute ~40 minutes.<p>> Where did you move to/from?<p>From midwest US to Tokyo environs.<p>> How are the schools?<p>Mixed. Japanese schools are excellent at many things - fostering discipline and responsibility, math/science, work ethic. Having students fetch/serve/clear up their own lunches, sweep their own corridors etc. is something I wish I could export. On the other hand schools here are terrible with initiative and English. International schools are super pricey - possibly beyond the reach of a typical programmer.<p>> fluent in the native language, language barrier difficult?<p>Yup and yup. You can live in Japan easily with very little language skill; career-wise being bilingual is a massive, massive boon. I sailed into my first tech job purely because I could speak very basic Japanese, and I could learn the tech faster than some other guy could learn the language. The language has a high initial hump, but is relatively sane and has very few rules to learn. (Apart from kanji, which are hard but for some purposes optional.)<p>> How long? Permanent resident? return to the US?<p>15 years or so, and yup for PR. I could see myself returning if there was a good reason though - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful to try to plan such things very far out.<p>> process to become a permanent resident?<p>Easy if you meet a few well-defined requirements, impossible otherwise. I vaguely recall it being: 10 years residency if single, 5 years if married to a national, but there are a few addenda.<p>> already have a job when you moved?<p>Nope - just arrived as a tourist and poked around. With tech skills and a smattering of language ability you can trip over an entry-level job; with one but not the other it&#x27;s doable but might take some looking. If you&#x27;re a senior person with no language skills, it&#x27;s still very possible but having several leads before arriving would be well-advised.<p>> cost of living? quality of life?<p>These are subjective, but for me, absolutely. Clean, safe, amazing public infrastructure, etc. It&#x27;s fairly pricey but salaries tend to be commensurate. If I was more bohemian I might hate it - I&#x27;ve known people who came intending to live here and left within three months.

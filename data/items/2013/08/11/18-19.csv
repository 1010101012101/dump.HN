6195743,comment,6195483,6195483,5,0,mdasen,,,"The area that I would be the most critical of the benchmarks is that it&#x27;s unclear whether frameworks that use process based concurrency are being set up well.  With frameworks that use process based concurrency, generally one wants to run as many processes as can fit in RAM with a nice amount of headroom.  That way, when one app process is waiting on I/O, another will be handling another request (and the operating system handles the context switching).<p>Right now, the setup.py for Django specifies that it will create 3 * NCPU worker processes.  On the i7, that would probably be 24 processes and possibly using an eighth of the RAM in the box.  Similarly, for Rails, the Unicorn configuration specifies 8 worker processes (one process per GB of RAM) regardless of whether it&#x27;s on EC2 or the i7 (while Django goes from 6 to 24 processes depending on the box it&#x27;s on since it&#x27;s 3 * NCPU).  For all we know, the CPU usage might be around 25% and the RAM usage even less.  As such, it&#x27;s hard to determine if the speed achieved is because of the limitations in the framework or whether the box is simply being under-utilized due to sub-optimal configuration.<p>If you&#x27;re going to do another around, more than any other changes, I think a view of the CPU and RAM usage would really help - if for no other reason than to show that the test is accurate.  Right now, I have questions about whether the process concurrency frameworks are well set-up.  Why would Django benefit from getting 4x the number of worker processes on the i7, but not Rails?  Is 24 processes utilizing the i7 box with Django?  CPU and RAM numbers would help provide answers.",1376246524

It&#x27;s impossible to achieve neither anonymity nor encryption through a naked single connection - you need several, at the very least for AUTH - and this alone multiplies the latency vs a single connection. The problem is that the naked eye can notice the difference between 100ms and 200ms, so the experience cannot be the same. The speed of light is already significant in world-wide distances when you consider a number of hops and a minimum number of messages being necessary to ACK, AUTH and then provide some anonymity layer that hides both sides of the connection.<p>Anonymous, secure, encrypted random web browsing CANNOT be as fast as a naked open connection. The difference can be minimised over long transfers, but latency over many requests is always going to be several times higher.<p>You can make all connections theoretically so fast that even a 5-fold slow down is still &quot;fast enough&quot;, but for many small transfers it simply cannot be done so fast that it&#x27;s humanly not noticeable.<p>Alas, there&#x27;s ALWAYS going to be a <i>noticeable</i> difference between open connections and hardened connections (to the standard we are talking about in this thread).

The author makes no attempt to address that problem. The answer he gives &quot;the UNIVERSE is like ALL consciousness, man&quot; doesn&#x27;t really have substance.<p>There is other crackpottery, such as the claim that the material world is <i>created by</i> consciousness. This is unscientific (and lousy philosophy) because it&#x27;s a philosophy that explains something without giving us any insight or deeper understanding.<p>The suggestion that &quot;consciousness <i>is</i> the present moment&quot; is also confused. Brains experience the present moment together because the present moment is part of the <i>state</i> of the individual brains. If two brains don&#x27;t share <i>any</i> common input then they don&#x27;t share the present moment either.

Don&#x27;t forget: police protection, fire protection, military protection, paved roads, functioning traffic signals and signs, groomed parks, trash collection (some places), up to sixteen years of education, enforcement of workplace safety standards, financial protection if you become suddenly disabled, a legal system in which to resolve disputes. I don&#x27;t know what your specific situation is, but just about everyone benefits from those government services in the U.S., and you personally may benefit from many others. I&#x27;m guessing that purchasing the first three alone, as an individual on a private market, would probably outrun the total you pay in taxes.<p>First of all the comment he was replying to was talking about services like housing, transportation, and healthcare, which already are provided by the market and aren&#x27;t really things the government has any advantage in. As for all the stuff it does pay for, at best it costs exactly the same amount as you have to pay in taxes. But the government spends money on a lot of other things with your taxes that don&#x27;t really benefit you. So you would save a decent amount of money. And with no competition, the services they do provide cost a lot more then they probably could.<p>>You could lower the individual costs to you of a lot of these by finding a bunch of other people who also need these services, and pooling your money to buy them together. That&#x27;s just how democratic government begins.<p>This applies to any service. Anything from food production to software development. A lot of people need those things, and they could cut costs if they pooled their money together for them.<p>>This is a dishonest characterization of the authority of a democratic government to levy taxes. Yes, if you don&#x27;t pay taxes you owe, someone might come and take your property, and those people might have weapons or threaten you with imprisonment. But that is a measure of last resort, which will surely only be taken if you fail to respond to a long line of more reasonable measures. It does a great injustice to people who actually live under oppressive regimes to compare the collection of taxes under a democratic government to the kind of arbitrary, might-makes-right authority those people are subject to.<p>He was definitely using words with bad connotations, but technically it is true. Everyone pays their taxes to avoid having their property stolen or going to jail. The fact that force isn&#x27;t applied unreasonably doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t there.<p>>Like the government&#x27;s other kinds of authority, it derives (most people think) from the consent of the governed.<p>There are people that don&#x27;t consent. At best you could say the majority consent. You can justify it by saying it&#x27;s better than any other system we know of, but not that people consent to it.",1376245597

I don&#x27;t believe people should be tricked into doing good. I don&#x27;t believe they are even doing good when they don&#x27;t fundamentally understand why they should be doing good. What results from this process is just a bunch of bad and evil people trying to forgive themselves of their sins. They&#x27;ll invade the religion, corrupt it, and pretty soon over time organized religion will just be filled with these types of people. THAT&#x27;S the reason why it&#x27;s bad to just trick people into doing good. Your religion will just start attracting these false worshippers, and you end up with religions filled with hypocrites. Religion is not objective. It is subjective, so it is very prone to be distorted and bent and shaped to satisfy the needs of both good and evil people. If you start making compromises and just get people who want to &quot;serve for a reward,&quot; you&#x27;ll end up slowly corrupting the religion and letting those evil people infiltrate, shape, and dominate it.

The corrupted ones are the ones the liberals and the atheists hate, because they are at the forefront of intolerance, outdated traditionalism, and hypocrisy. They give the GOOD Christians a bad name. Unfortunately, this easy corruption of religion is fundamental to the way it operates. If you indiscriminately acquire new religion members, your religion is prone to infection, like an open wound. This is why religions who don&#x27;t go out with a sales force, adding whoever and whenever they can, are less prone to infection and corruption.<p>This is why religion that lacks a sales team has more credence because honestly, a religion that sells itself is more believable as divine and correct.",1376245235

Instead, he suggests that information may have both physical and mental manifestations.<p>While I once found this line of reasoning convincing, I&#x27;m no longer so sure it matters.  While consciousness itself may be non-physical, under the assumption that physical effects have only physical causes, we should be able to explain why we say we are conscious in physical terms. I&#x27;m not sure that an explanation of the latter will also explain the former, but in the end, I don&#x27;t think we will care. I think we will find that the everyday concept of &quot;consciousness&quot; mixes together many different ideas, each of which are simpler to solve on their own than they are when we consider them together.<p>Roughly a century ago we went through a similar process with the concept of life. People wanted to know what makes a thing alive, and many intelligent scientists were drawn to the idea that there is something innate to a living organism that makes it alive. After decades of biological research, we&#x27;re still not sure what makes an organism alive, in the sense that the line between living organisms and inert biological material is not well-defined, but we know how living organisms reproduce and grow, and that&#x27;s really what matters.",1376245093

What&#x27;s the point of that? In fact, those are the first options in the video and audio sections! Who would ever want to disable video or audio in a video player? You already have a volume and mute control, and you can disable video and audio tracks from the menus. So why is that the first option in the simple preferences user interface? Was there a huge demand from novice users for that option? Terrible user interface design.<p>There are many other things about the UI design that are extremely annoying, a lot having to do with the out of control feature creep and totally uncoordinated committee design. All those advanced options, yet there is no way to set it to always show advanced options every time. Isn&#x27;t it ironic that it has millions of options, but no option to always show the millions of options by default? Or maybe it&#x27;s just failing to save the &quot;advanced mode&quot; option. So lame.<p>It gives me the distinct impression that nobody on the development team gives a shit.",1376244088

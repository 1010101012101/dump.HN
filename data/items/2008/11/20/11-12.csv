I've used prototype and dojo over the years, but they don't hold a candle to jquery.<p>You are right in being suspect of speed issues. However, look at a common use of jQuery and compare it to straight JS.<p>$('a[href^=""https""]').addClass('secureLink');<p>This one simple line selects all of the anchor tags on a page that are SSL links, then adds a custom css class to just those anchors. To write that in straight JS you would need roughly 7 lines, which includes an element match, looping through those, retrieving the href content of each one, doing a string match against the results, and adding a new attribute for the class.<p>At the end of it, the classic JS code isn't any more efficient and its a lot harder to write and read.<p>Additionally, since we've already selected the anchors with secure SSL links, we can do a lot more things with the jquery object without having to take the cost penalty of doing a new DOM lookup with getElementsByTagName and byId for subsequent operations. Lets chain some more operations:<p>$('a[href^=""https""]').addClass('secureLink').appendTo( $('<div id=""secureLinkDiv""/>'));<p>Now we're not only adding a custom class to the selection, we're moving all of our matching anchor elements to a new div that's being created on the fly called secureLinkDiv. This is very efficient because you're still operating on the initial object collection elements and you don't have to re-select the group for subsequent modifications.<p>In the rare cases where you can write straight JS that is more efficient than existing jQuery methods, regular JS mixes quite normally with jQuery. So you could use a selector like I did for the secure links, then iterate through that object and do your straight JS. Simple example:<p>$('a').each(function(i){\n//reference each 'a' element by $(this) or with i\n});<p>Writing javascript in jQuery has made it SO MUCH EASIER to code now that I can't say enough how remarkable the difference is.  JS used to be a fun thing to mess with, and a tiresome chore when writing code for work. Now with jQuery my code is much leaner and runs better, its also fun to write again and opens up a <i>lot</i> of possibilities to easily create different effects that would have been hard to do before, simply because the code would have been too lengthy to efficiently write and then debug.<p>Give jQuery a try. Its worth it.",1227179366

Is it easy to predict protonation states of molecules at different pH levels and electrostatic potentials? Can it do molecular dynamics?<p>Who cares that they have built-in access to the melting point of caffeine?!",1227179055

Would really like to hear more about people who did that, as I have a couple of questions that remain unanswered for now.<p>- Do you create a company before leaving, or after coming back home? (That would allow you to charge for early versions of your product, thus verifying people are interested to buy)<p>- How do you tap in the local developer/designer community to outsource part of your project?<p>- How do you decide whether to rent an apartment/stay in hotels? I would prefer to stay in an apartment, however I imagine you stay first in a hotel in a couple of days before deciding to rent an apartment.<p>- What kind of place did you find more energizing to work at?

In particular:<p>a) Shiny math and shiny languages are negatively correlated; the mathier a grad student is, the more likely he is to use Matlab and the less likely he is to actually know how to program. When mathier people write non-Matlab code, it is often (but obviously not always) very shitty. Now, there are ML people, but they're a small subset of mathy programmers.<p>b) The ""Terran"" description is closest to what you would think of as a normal hacker, but hackers generally care that what they make is good, and people who care about code being good are not usually characterized as ""just getting shit done,"" since for example they rewrite code that works just because it's ugly.<p>c) Terrans, by which I mean hackers, can and do learn math and then become unstoppable.

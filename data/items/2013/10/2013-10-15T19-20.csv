He&#x27;s been fairly successful relative to other people who write new languages.<p>Excel is entirely programmable using the standard .NET stack and languages [from PowerShell to F#].<p>If the idea is to target the tool as a new IDE for experienced programmers, how does improve productivity over EMACS or Vim etc.? Or without it being an extension of one of those existing ecosystems, what is gained in exchange for all that is lost?<p>Which suggests to me that incorporating the functionality as an extension to one or more of those ecosystems might be more simple than competing with them for experienced coders.",1381867192

I&#x27;ve never made a push server, let alone a node.js one. The first thing I&#x27;m going to do is make an &quot;echo server&quot; just to verify I understand what I&#x27;m doing. If I&#x27;m doing this for Unity or Flash, I&#x27;ll quickly learn I need a separate &quot;policy server&quot; to even make this work, so I&#x27;ll hack it together until it works.<p>I&#x27;ll then iterate on this until I have a client sitting there and at random times it receives &quot;push events&quot; and reacts to them by printing something to the console or lighting up something on the GUI.<p>This is Step 1: I&#x27;ve hacked it, I made it work.<p>The point is that I wouldn&#x27;t dare push my changes to everyone else yet. I&#x27;m going to iterate a few times, add a couple more of the features I know I&#x27;ll need. I&#x27;ll quickly discover the abstractions I need for this to have something of an architecture. At this point all the little nitpicky things and API calls I needed to do just to &quot;make it work&quot; get put in their proper places. Build scripts are made or modified. Tests are written.<p>This is Step 2: I&#x27;ve made it right. I haven&#x27;t overengineered it, but I&#x27;ve expressed my solution in terms of the abstractions that make the most sense. I can bring in my experience outside of this specific problem to determine how far is too far. YAGNI and all that.<p>Next, I might throw a wild amount of connections at it. I might have it generate as many push notifications per second as it possibly can. I&#x27;ll find some crashes, some resource leaks, and some REALLY naive, slow code that an hour ago I thought was OK. But that&#x27;s alright, it&#x27;s almost never the abstractions that are slow, it&#x27;s an algorithm that needs to be improved or replaced, or an API I didn&#x27;t quite understand.<p>That&#x27;s Step 3: make it fast.<p>When all is said and done, I probably have 10 - 20 commits in my local repository. The first ones were absolute brutish hacks. The middle ones were factorings and abstraction exploration. The latter ones are performance tweaks and polishing.<p>This never gets pushed to anyone else, it&#x27;s my private experience and workflow. These commits all get rebased on top of everyone else&#x27;s finished work and squashed into one commit. I will still HAVE my local history, but nobody else needs to know or care that version 0 of my push server was held together with duct tape and bailing wire.<p>When a whole team works like this (and if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find a team that can), really good things happen. &quot;Hacking&quot; is still involved, it just turns into &quot;engineering&quot; by the time the code has to move out of my basement and start paying its own bills.",1381866626

6555822,comment,6548893,6554092,3,0,tytso,,,"It&#x27;s true that many of the attacks (such as BEAST) rely on attacks related to the IV.  However, look at underlying mechanism of that attack; it requires that the attacker be able to predict the entire IV (which it can do since it can use the CBC residue from the previous packet).   If the attacker can predict 64 out of the 128 bits of an IV used for AES, that&#x27;s less of a disaster than if the attacker can predict 64 out of the 128 bits for an AES key.   So there is a difference, although I might agree with you that relying on application developers to understand these distinctions might be unrealistic.<p>You&#x27;re right that for DSA nonces, even a partial failure of the RNG is a disaster; to me, that&#x27;s more of an indictment of DSA as being really extremely fragile.<p>I agree that making /dev/urandom to be as secure as is possible, as quickly as possible after a cold start, is a good thing, and indeed most of my efforts have been focused in that area.   I&#x27;m not convinced the FreeBSD approach is a panacea, since that presumes FreeBSD&#x27;s entropy estimator is sufficiently accurate.  And I&#x27;ll note that even with the Fortuna design, which completely gives up on the entropy estimator, it&#x27;s still subject to the cold start problem --- you just don&#x27;t know when Fortuna has accumulated enough entropy such that it is secure.   In that regard, it&#x27;s no better than Linux&#x27;s /dev/random approach.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to some adding a cold-start block to /dev/urandom, and ultimately, I might go there just because it&#x27;s easier than making recommendations that userspace wait until the last possible moment to lazily generate keying materials.   However, it&#x27;s a bit of a bandaid, so I&#x27;m more interested in trying to collect as much entropy as possible right after boot, to narrow the window after a cold start.<p>FreeBSD&#x27;s approach certainly won&#x27;t help with the criticism leveled by the &quot;/dev/random is not robust&quot; paper, since it assumes that fundamentally the entropy estimator is broken.  But if it&#x27;s broken, then FreeBSD Yarrow will also not be robust in the face of the cold start problem.   So it&#x27;s certainly not going to help people who are going to kvetch about entropy estimators being hopeless.",1381866107

People could still donate to the Red Cross if the donations were not tax deductible, and the Red Cross could still operate if there were no such thing as a tax-exempt organization.<p>Also, when you say &quot;perceived to have social benefits&quot;, <i>whose</i> perception, exactly, are we talking about? If you argue (I&#x27;m not saying you specifically are, but many do) that we need to give special benefits to the Red Cross because otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t get enough donations, you are basically saying that other people&#x27;s perceptions of what activities have social benefits differ from yours, but since yours is obviously better, you are justified in skewing people&#x27;s perceptions of social benefit by giving them tax breaks for donating to the Red Cross.<p>Even if we leave aside the question of what justifies skewing other people&#x27;s perceptions, in a sane world, you wouldn&#x27;t have to do it anyway. People&#x27;s perceptions of the social benefits of various activities would be sane, i.e., reasonably accurate, so you wouldn&#x27;t have to trick them into paying for things they otherwise would not pay for--more precisely, doing so would be a net loss to society.<p>(I&#x27;m not sure it isn&#x27;t a net loss to society even in our actual world, because I think most organizations that take advantage of tax-exempt status are not doing things which are as obviously beneficial to society as the Red Cross.

Current vehicle safety codes require in-cabin monitoring of tire pressure.  One way to do it is for the car to pay attention to changes in wheel rotation speeds (lower pressure means smaller effective radius).  Another is to put a pressure guage in each wheel that talks to the car&#x27;s computer wirelessly and gives more exact numbers so is more common.  So even without RFID in the tires, most cars still transmit a unique ID number everywhere they go.<p><a href=""http://news.rutgers.edu/news-releases/2010/08/wireless-tire-pressu-20100811"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.rutgers.edu/news-releases/2010/08/wireless-tire-...</a>",1381865445

6555637,comment,6552628,6555229,1,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;This leaves few options to find out information about Satoshi. However, if the NSA ran a sufficient number of nodes, they could easily determine the first node to propagate a transaction. This would be Satoshi&#x27;s IP address. That is why they would do this.&quot;<p>I suspect that there would be easier ways.  Even just the <i>time</i> when the transaction occurs would reveal a data point (e.g. when the sender is awake).  It also would not help much to avoid using exchanges; if the target mined their Bitcoins, then you can at least narrow them down to the people who could mine enough for the transaction (which becomes easier as transactions become larger).  If the target was given the Bitcoins by someone else, you now have another transaction that can reveal some data points (e.g. when <i>that</i> transaction occurred, who sent the money, etc.).<p>Like I said, <i>auxiliary</i> information is key here.  Sure, transactions <i>in isolation</i> might be hard to associate with a person, but transactions do not occur in a vacuum.  If you want to speak rigorously about anonymity, you need to somehow include the notion that an attacker might have access to some information beyond the observations they make of the system; the point is that the system should not expand the attacker&#x27;s knowledge (except by some negligible amount).  This is the intuition behind concepts like &quot;unlinkability&quot; in academic work on digital cash:  it should be computationally difficult to identify transactions that originated from the same spender (even better is the notion of <i>transferable</i> cash, which allows for &quot;fully&quot; offline payments; however, this has the drawback of causing the representation of the money to grow in the number of parties that have received it, and so it scales poorly [1]).<p>So, imagine a system where a party being watched by the NSA uses an offline protocol to pay another party e.g. they meet out in a field somewhere and do the transaction without any Internet connection.  A system with divisibility and unlinkability [2] would make it hard for the NSA to track the target from the transaction, as the target could withdraw more money from the bank than he spends, and the receiver&#x27;s deposit does not reveal which user sent the receiver the money (at least beyond what would be revealed by things like the timing of the withdrawals and deposits and the amount of money being deposited; the point is that the transaction protocol itself does not add any additional information).  A system that supports transferable cash would take this even further:  a party might receive the cash from one friend, then send it to another, both using offline transactions, and the NSA would not be able to identify &quot;middle&quot; party (or the &quot;first&quot; party that made the withdrawal).<p>Of course, these definitions cannot be applied to Bitcoin, for an obvious reason:  these definitions call for a bank in the system, which acts as an authority on the validity of the money (sound familiar?) and which identifies &quot;cheaters&quot; e.g. double-spenders.  On the other hand, there seems to be no good security definition for digital cash that does not involve such an authority; I suspect this has something to do with the lack of an economic theory for money with no intrinsic value <i>and</i> with no such authority.<p>[1] <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1754992"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1754992</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/216.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/216.pdf</a>",1381864360

Optical illusions cause letterforms with round edges (C, O, S) or pointed edges (A, V, W) to need to extend slightly farther in the rounded/pointed direction to appear to be the same size as other straighter shapes. This is called “overshoot” (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_%28typography%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_%28typography%29</a>).<p>- The spacing and kerning both need work. Letter pairs such as OV, FR, IA, AI, KE, EY, OX, MY, AP, and RT are too far apart. I’ve found that it’s easier to kern if you look at your outlines upside-down and backwards (I know Fontlab Studio has a built-in option to preview text in this manner, Glyphs might as well). Doing so helps your brain regard the outlines purely as shapes without getting sidetracked by their semiotic significance.<p>Another trick to type design is understanding that mathematical/geometric precision do not always result in the <i>appearance</i> of mathematical/geometric precision. Measurements that should theoretically be equal (such as the heights of letters as previously mentioned) often need to be fudged in order to look equal to the imperfect human eye.<p>The forums at Typophile are a great place to have your work critiqued by professional type designers (<a href=""http://typophile.com/forum/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typophile.com/forum/1</a>).

The codebase of some of the big classic Lisp programs, like CMUCL, Emacs, or some of the Symbolics stuff, might fit in this category of hackerly productions.<p>A small, clean, and elegant program or system designed largely by one person. Fabrice Bellard&#x27;s &#x27;tcc&#x27; is a good example of this kind of hackerly production.<p>Those lead to pretty different end results, but they have in common a focus on individual creativity and/or virtuosity rather than method/process. I tend to find that style of programming the most interesting to read about and observe, but the point is well taken that I might not want that hackerly approach (either kind) applied to lots of software. Something like train control systems, or business rules, might benefit from something more boring and industrial.",1381864211

If you maintain a large machine-generated JS codebase (like I do by proxy, with my compiler), it is a regular occurrence that new releases of Chrome (and Firefox, to be fair) will knock parts of your code out of the JIT sweet spot and suddenly start optimizing other parts. Sometimes code that was fast becomes slow for no reason, other times some slow code becomes fast and now you look at profiles and realize you need to remove caching logic or that your code will be faster if you remove an optimization.<p>The arms race never ends, and keeping up with it is a full-time job. asm.js fixes this, by precisely specifying the &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; and giving you a guarantee that if you satisfy its requirements, <i>all</i> your code will be optimized, unless the VM is broken. This lets you build a compiler that outputs valid asm.js code, verify it, and leave it alone.<p>These days I don&#x27;t even have time to keep up with the constant performance failures introduced by new releases, but JSIL is a nearly two-year-old project now and they cropped up regularly the whole time. Ignoring the performance failures isn&#x27;t an option because customers don&#x27;t want slow applications (and neither do I).",1381864202

Now I know both pretty well as a result.  coffeescript compiles to really readable javascript anyway (yes, that&#x27;s subjective).<p>I use both in the same project.  For example, I have a gruntfile written in javascript.  It&#x27;s easy for me to modify it.  The rest of my code is in coffeescript.  It&#x27;s easy for me to modify it.<p>I think this is a really superficial line for you to draw in the sand.  Use the best tool for the job.

A lot of my professors got their PhDs from Ivy League institutions (Berkeley, Yale and Oxbridge). These were also the professors who subscribed heavily to the &#x27;liberal&#x27; ethos and focused on those &#x27;feel&#x27; arguments you described.<p>In contrast, the old-school professors who studied their whole life here would shoot down your arguments mercilessly if you didn&#x27;t back them up with facts. You couldn&#x27;t tell them that you &#x27;felt&#x27; that Moby Dick was a symbol of American pioneer spirit; you had to give specific instances, quote research papers to justify your stand.<p>It&#x27;s true that liberal arts education needs to cleanse itself. There are just too many cool rich kids in humanities who end up dragging not-so-cool, not-so-rich, and not-so-talented kids into humanities majors. All the kids who fit the liberal arts stereotype to a T in my college also came from loaded families (yet, you wouldn&#x27;t know it if you looked at them).<p>The smartest, and the hardest working, on the other hand, were almost always there because they really, really wanted to do what they were doing.",1422485784

See for example all the different unfounded and unrelated theories and insinuations that RT spread around after the MH17 downing, such as &quot;Ukraine had BUKs too&quot;, &quot;It was Ukraine thinking it was Putins presidential plane&quot; and &quot;why didn&#x27;t Ukraine close off the airspace?&quot; Now, is that serious journalism? The sole purpose of that was to confuse people and instill in them the idea that the truth about MH17 will never be known.<p>> The root of the conflict between West and Russia today is deeper than superficial slogans about who shot down MH17 <snip><p>Many things can be said about what you&#x27;re saying but I won&#x27;t and I&#x27;ll stop you here. 300 innocent civilians (mainly Dutch, Malaysian and British) died a horrible death due to this dirty war and evidence is overwhelming that it was done using Russian weapons by Russian or Russia-supported soldiers, in a dirty war that is fueled (at least materially) mainly by the Kremlin. Your claim that this is about &quot;superficial slogans&quot; is telling. Yes, many more people have died and yes, on the grand scale of things, 300 casualties is peanuts. But in the west these things are taken seriously and will not be forgotten. MH17 and the aftermath is one of the growing number of red lines that Putin crossed, and Russia will have to pay the price for this. Again, you may not agree but these red lines do exist and it&#x27;s not up to you or Putin to decide that they don&#x27;t. I feel sorry for the Russian people, but I have no sympathy for a Putin apologist who believes the MH17 event is about superficial slogans.",1422485728

8963077,comment,8962185,8963034,0,0,benbreen,,,"I really have to disagree with one aspect of this comment (&quot;the erosion of standards in the humanities.&quot;) Perhaps that&#x27;s to be expected because I&#x27;m an academic who works in the humanities. But my point is a simple one and it&#x27;s something that you can test out yourself: try comparing a half dozen academic history article written in, say, 1950, to a half dozen from 2015. I predict that, on average, a 2015 article will feature a far more robust evidence base, a broader range of sources, a richer historiography, and more rigorous language training than its counterpart from the 1940s, 50s or 60s. In my experience there is simply no comparison. In part this is because digitized texts make it so much easier to access a wide range of sources, but it also has to do with an increase in standards of graduate education. Getting a PhD in a field like history used to be an old boys club based on connections and family money. It certainly still retains some of those trappings today, but I think there can be no question that academic training today is far more rigorous (and entering graduate school or getting an article accepted more competitive) than it was in decades past.<p>I don&#x27;t really take issue with the comments about students and multiple choice exams, though. The way we teach the humanities in the US leaves a lot to be desired.",1422485504

You can say he had a bit of a faux pas problem, like a certain current US politician, but much worth. For example, after his first speech in UN general assembly, he was caught on tape saying that &quot;I felt an aurora of light engulfing me as I gave my speech&quot;, apparently mistaking the spotlight with something more supernatural. For the whole 8 years, he was a living, talking, (and unfortunately) governing joke. We learned not to take a single word out of his mouth seriously early in his term.<p>Quoting him regarding Iran&#x27;s foreign policy is some sort of out-of-context quote or selection bias. He said a lot of stupid things. Don&#x27;t take him seriously.",1422485197

Other models propose a model with a soft cut-off point (so for every dollar beyond a certain baseline of income you get some fraction of a dollar less basic income, up to a level where you -- again depending on the model -- either start paying it back or simply don&#x27;t get any basic income at all). In any case the idea is that (unlike with welfare models like the one we have in Germany[0]) for every dollar you earn you actually end up with extra cash in your pocket.<p>Ideally the basic income should be high enough to provide a frugal but sustainable standard of living with access to everything necessary to participate in the market. But arguments can be made for lower amounts as well.<p>[0]: One problem with the German welfare system (and similar ones) is that if you receive welfare benefits and earn money, that money is subtracted from the benefits you receive at a rate of pretty much one-to-one. So if you (hypothetically) get 400 euros in benefits and then find a job that pays you less than 400 euros, you effectively end up with the same money you&#x27;d have without the job. This creates an unintentional incentive for welfare recipients not to take on low-paying jobs (frequently the only ones they qualify for) which is then clumsily counteracted with various legal constructs (like forcing people to take job interviews or accept job offers for jobs they are not a good fit for at all). It&#x27;s not a terrible system, but the design flaws are obvious.",1422485015

Part of that involves taking the Sunset Limited between Los Angeles and Beaumont. That&#x27;s a scheduled [2] 40 hour trip from Los Angeles to Beaumont, and 36 hours from Beaumont to Los Angeles.<p>There was no wifi on the train then (or now, I believe), and I did not have a phone with cellular internet.<p>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS came out in North America just 3 weeks before my trip started, so I saved that for the train trip. I also brought Mario Kart and some other Mario game that I had not finished. Oh, and Brain Age was very helpful--it includes a bunch of Sudoku puzzles. I also had a bunch of podcasts and some audiobooks on my iPod.<p>I did not bring, if I recall correctly, any physical books on the train. I wanted to travel light, and the books I was currently reading or wanting to read were all heavy hardbacks. (Kindle was not out yet...it was released while I was I was in Texas, a few days before the trip home started).<p>All I brought on the train was my PowerBook, the entertainment stuff listed above, my phone, a TomTom GPS, a couple charges to keep the aforementioned stuff running, toothbrush and toothpaste, a comb, a swiss army knife, and enough clothes to cover the time on the train.<p>Everything else I&#x27;d need or want for the 3+ weeks I&#x27;d actually be in Texas, including several hardback books, I shipped via UPS or FedEx ahead to the hotel.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why more people don&#x27;t do that, at least for stays where they are bringing a lot of stuff. You&#x27;ve already got enough to deal with on boarding day...why add wrangling two or three big pieces of checked luggage to that? And FedEx and UPS lose luggage at a lower rate than airlines (I could not find data on Amtrak lost luggage rates). [3]<p>[1] for the usual reason one would go to Beaumont, Texas if one has no relatives there. A patent I was involved in ended up owned by someone who sued someone else, and I had to go be a witness.<p>[2] Most of the route is over track owner by freight rail companies, and their trains have priority. That means AmTrak spends a lot of time sitting on passing sidings waiting for a freight train to pass. Add several hours to scheduled times for any long trip.<p>[3] I suppose it might depend on how things are getting paid for. Since I was going in order to be a witness in civil litigation, someone else was paying for my travel expenses, and they had a pretty loose wallet. If you are paying for your own trip and your fare includes a certain amount of luggage it might be hard to justify letting that freebie go to waste and paying for FedEx.",1422484980

Because react is just plain JS (no templates!), you will map the array of items to components in your render. You give each item a key so that react can reconcile components across renders. If component with same key is returned from render next time then it&#x27;s kept in the DOM (and any updates applied), if not then it&#x27;s removed. So the involved part becomes determining what is visible or not, and then slicing your list of items to only map a subset. This is the more involved part. I haven&#x27;t built anything like this myself, but I&#x27;m guessing it basically boils down to: listening to scroll events on container, determining y offset, get height of contaoner and height of elements,  use that to determine which items in list should be mapped to components in render. That bit is the same whether react or not.<p>See James Longster&#x27;s epic blog post &quot;Reducing User Interface Complexity, Or Why React Is Awesome&quot; [0].

The part about temporary marriage most westerners seem to oblivious about is after the end of marriage (for any reason: death, divorce or end of the term of temporary marriage), the woman cannot get married for 4 months and 10 days.

Because of the economic realities of the recent decades, young people may stay engaged for more than a year before they can afford to get married. So, many people &quot;temporarily marry&quot; their fiancé/fiancée upon engagement in order to be able to hang out without offending social and religious values.<p>(Even with temporary marriage, it&#x27;s still taboo for engaged people to move in together or have sex, but this is different from family to family and from town to town.)",1422482702

She gradually became more relaxed and one day the scarf went in the bin. The other considered her relatives &quot;dead to her&quot; from the moment I met her. Not surprisingly, she was not from Tehran.<p>Studying abroad is an important thing for Iranian students, but this presents some huge problems for a theocracy where sexual discrimination is so firmly entrenched. For every student that leaves and never returns, there are probably several who go home and try to change things for the better.<p>The fact that Iran allows students, especially female students, to study abroad suggests that things are not as dire there as one would expect from consuming U.S. media.  The U.S.&#x27;s policy of confrontation with Iran&#x27;s leaders is, strangely enough, probably one of the few things keeping them afloat.  Fear of foreign powers is a powerful tool, as anyone in the U.S. should now know. The best course of action over the next few years may be to reduce the level of confrontation with Iran&#x27;s leaders and let the Iranian people, who are increasingly at odds with their country&#x27;s policies, take care of their leaders on their own.",1422482429

I went to different dealership because the belt tensioner broke while my brother was driving and we got it hauled over to the closest dealership (at this point why not take a chance).  They fixed the belt and the damage caused.  I was not a happy camper and mentioned the brakes.  I had a bit of trouble believing the original dealership's claim that anti-lock brakes are meant to sound like a sledgehammer.  The new dealership fixed the breaks (it was a ""fixed"" recall on my car) for no money.  They did ask why I didn't take it to the original dealership and that got some giggles.<p>When GM shutdown a chunk of their dealerships they got to stay open, but the one with a much better service department closed.

4047058,comment,4046757,4046757,10,0,sherwin,,,"I used a Chromebook (Samsung Series 5) for an entire academic year as a student.  The biggest benefits were having everything synced in the cloud (so you're not too attached to it), extreme portability (super thin and super light, instant on is fantastic) and ~10 hours of battery life. I charged the thing about once a week!<p>However, I question who would get a Chromebox though, because the portability + battery life + instant on are no longer relevant in this case, and those were by far the biggest benefits for the Chromebook. For a little more (~400), you could get a very respectable machine running a more powerful OS.<p>Some general thoughts on my experiences with the Chromebook:\nAs a general computing device, I thought it was more or less completely sufficient. I used it to take notes (google docs / evernote) in class and it was awesome for that (light and portable).<p>With more than 7-8 tabs, things can get slightly sluggish (read: not instantaneous). Running more than 15 or so and you start getting serious performance issues. This is less of a problem than I thought because it forces me to maintain focus (I regularly can have >100 tabs when using my desktop). Full screen 1080p video also was sluggish.<p>It has a shell, so you can SSH and code also.<p>Frequently less technical friends would ask ""but ... it only runs chrome?"" to which I respond ""well what can you not do in chrome?"" and they have a very hard time giving an example. With gmail / calendar / docs / evernote / your music web app service of choice / etc, almost everything can be done in the browser.<p>To be fair, I also use a powerful desktop for more intense tasks (photo editing, coding, and occasional gaming). I doubt I would use the chromebook/box as my primary computer.",1338454353

They can't require or not require anything of the OEMs, because they're legally barred from doing so.<p>They could do anything for Windows 9, if they last that long in the Post-PC era. It's a moot point.<p>And ARM is a red herring, it's a totally  new platform and MS could be subsidizing the hardware and/or OS license fees in exchange for App Store revenue (like Kindle Fire), so they lose out if the user swaps the OS.

However, like you, a lot of laymen assumes that these theories can be explained in terms of analogies with ""everyday life"" things. I recently watched all of Richard Feynmen's lectures (the easiest to understand is ""the character of physical law"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Character_of_Physical_Law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Character_of_Physical_Law</a>),and in it, he explained, quite well, what it means to have a mathematical law. It goes on to some detail explanation of what quantum chromodynamics is, and how photons' behaviour cannot possibly be analogous to anything you can experience at the macro scale.<p>I understand your frustration (since i feel the exact same) - why is it that we have advanced so much, and yet still have no idea what inertia really is? Or mass for that matter. We know how to predict things from using various mathematical laws, but i think we are no closer to understanding ""the truth"", than 100 years ago. Perhaps it is impossible.<p>or perhaps, in the next century, or the next millenium, humans will look back, and see today's physics being just as primative as what we would see the cavemen's theories of the world is.",1338451589

However here in Austraila we reciently had to fight againt a proposal for manditory internet censorship, who's reason for being was precicly: ""Think of the children!"".  But just because trying to protect children has been used as a cloak for some pretty unpalatable things does not mean that everything done in the name of protecting children is automatically bad.  For example child labour laws were done with the express goal of protecting children and you would be hard pressed to find somebody that would argue they are a bad thing.<p>Instead we need to think about what is being proposed and evaluate each case it on its merits.  Having a knee jerk reaction against filtering is almost as bad as having a knee jerk reaction against porn.<p>In this case:<p>* The filter is opt in, not opt out.<p>* No images would be permantly removed, only hidden<p>* The feature should be visible, clear and useable.  Its not going to silently hide things.<p>* The principle of least astonishment for the reader would be applied.<p>I belive that this presents a quite acceptable trade off, between making all information avable to everybody and as you put it - censorship.  The tool is there for anybody who wants to use it, and if you don't it has no impact on you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Controversial_content"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Controversial...</a>",1338451429

If someone wants to fax or mail in a takedown request to Facebook, they have to comply with that too.<p>As several people have mentioned in these topics, the only real issue is Facebook's failure to handle counterclaims properly. That's how the DMCA is supposed to work. You file a copyright infringement claim, the host takes down the material. I file a counterclaim, the host puts the material back up, and it's up to you to sue me.<p>If they just responded promptly to counterclaims, the hand-wringing about bogus claims is mostly irrelevant.",1304107138

2498762,comment,2497463,2498526,1,0,tzs,,,"It's more than that. LaTeX is great when I have already produced a document that says exactly what I want it to say, and now I am trying to find the way to turn that into the best looking print or PDF that I can.<p>LaTeX doesn't do anything to help me figure out what to say.<p>For word processing, OpenOffice is pretty good. It's biggest failing compared to Word is a lack of a good organizational tool. It has some kind of ""navigator"" mode that has occasionally been offered as the answer for people who miss Word's outline view, but it doesn't compare. A few years ago, there was a post on the OO developer forums where a major OO developer acknowledged that this was a serious lack, and said it was on the roadmap. However, it would require a lot of chances so we were not to expect it soon. When that gets in, OO will be a lot more useful.<p>For spreadsheets, the gap is larger, and OO is behind not only at the high end (which is arguably not too critical--most people aren't using anywhere near the full power of Excel) but also has too many annoyances for casual use.<p>For example, on my gaming PC I wanted to use a spreadsheet to keep track of data on my sales from the auction house in Warhammer Online. When adding the data for a new auction, I needed to enter the date and time into a cell. Surprisingly, OO does not have a good way to enter the current date and time into a cell!<p>It has a functions that give the current date and time, and you can put those into the cell. That cell will then update to show the current date and time every time you open the spreadsheet or recalculate.<p>You can have a cell with those, and copy the values and paste the values, not the formula, but that is clumsy and awkward.<p>The best solution I've seen is to use a formula (such as =NOW()) in the cell, and then turn off AutoCalculate for that cell. That will freeze it unless you explicitly tell it to update. BTW, the manual claims that AutoCalculate does not apply to formulas involving NOW(), but what they mean I think is that the formula does not automatically update every second and trigger an updated of the whole sheet.<p>In Excel there are commands to insert the date and time in a cell, and they have keyboard shortcuts by default.<p>This might not seem like a big deal, but it means the OO is frustrating for my simple task of recording my auctions, and Excel would not be. When a program can in theory meet all your needs, but it keeps hitting you with these little annoyances, they add up.<p>Joel Spolsky wrote a great article about Excel and its competition from when he was on the Excel team. They and the major competitor were racing to get their next versions out. They had both concentrated on adding advanced functions--the kind of things that you'd use if you were a finance guy at a major corporation working on a complicated merger or an IPO or things like that. Things no normal person does.<p>Before the release, Microsoft did some serious user testing to find out what people ACTUALLY used Excel for. They found that one of the biggest uses was as a simple database for keeping lists of things, and doing simply calculations on those things.<p>They changed direction for the release. The fancy advanced functions were put on hold, and they concentrated on adding things to make Excel good at handling lists and doing the kind of calculations people actually wanted.<p>When that version of Excel came out, and the competitor came out with its ""hey, you can do your merger or IPO on this!"" set of features, Excel took over the market.<p>The OO people need to do what the Excel people did.",1304107057

Bose could also go public at any time, and have a very large exit.<p>Regardless of the lack of an exit, the Bose founders are extremely rich today, and they don't have to remain involved in Bose for it to continue to operate and grow.

Because if the PS3 knows how to encrypt and you own the server, decrypting is as trivial as just looking at the plain text<p>You are wrong; They could have done that. That's the whole premise of public key cryptography (google/wikipedia if you are not familiar). It's possible, (and easy) for the client to encrypt something that a client cannot in general decrypt, nor can anyone else without the decryption key. And it is actually a good idea to not put the decryption key on the server you talk to - only on a server that actually talks to the payment gateway.<p>> And how would you use that hashed CC number on the server? Unhashing (impossible)? Send the hash to the CC company (good luck)?<p>Many credit card processors let you do something similar - i.e. you register the CC details once, get a ""reference id"", and then use that reference id to charge. I'm sure Sony could have used one of them if they cared.<p>> For people who don't own the server and are listening in SSL is enough and for people with access to the server neither SSL nor any other encryption is enough.<p>That is true. However, that is just one facet that needs defense, and one that has had almost no attacks in the last 5 years -- because SSL (if practiced correctly, which it rarely is) solves that problem, and attacking the server is usually easier than listening on the pipes.<p>> They have done a lot of things wrongly, but this IMHO is not one of them.<p>Everything they have done about this is wrong.

I'm not sure it can be reasonably argued otherwise.<p>Everything from forcing hardware vendors to bundle their OS to forcing Internet Explorer installs to the infamous Halloween documents to their covert dealings with SCO & everyone else over Linux and patents.<p>Surprisingly, it still seems pretty hard to get the hardware I want without paying for a Windows OS I:<p>1.) Won't use, because I'd throw Linux on it.\n2.) Don't need, because I already have several valid Windows licenses which are unused.<p>But yes, certainly some of Apple's walled garden/30% actions are alarming.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_antitrust"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_antitrust</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents</a>",1304103721

But I have a bit more confidence in Apple's ability to police their store, and more importantly, official apps are sandboxed and can't touch the filesystem or OS directly.<p>But honestly, I'm more concerned with quality than trust. I think that malicious apps are probably very rare on Cydia; I'm more concerned with background processes that eat battery life, changes to the underlying OS which make the phone unreliable, buggy code with unintended side effects, etc. I don't think this is the norm, but I have very little information with which to separate the gems from the junk.<p>On a computer, installing apps with no restrictions is the norm, and so there are countless forms of social proof to discover which apps are safe and reliable. I'm looking for something equivalent for Cydia packages, as well as detailed manifests of what is installed and running with each install. (Perhaps I should just stick to paid packages, where the author has higher incentive to maintain quality.)",1304103625

Even if Product Hunt doesn&#x27;t raise a single dollar in funding or make a single dollar in revenue, they have shown they are able to deliver customers to early stage startups.  And by bringing them into the fold, other YC companies get preferential access to a new way to find customers.  It&#x27;s clearly a win/win.",1405619989
8049100,comment,8048866,8048866,12,0,jonnathanson,,,"I&#x27;d been watching this subject with great interest when MSFT first made the announcement several years ago. And watching hopefully, at that. XBox Live accounts for a large share of Netflix streaming usage, and in theory, MSFT could have developed shows the way Netflix is doing so. Unfortunately, as a lot of people in this space are learning, high-quality shows cost top dollar and take awhile to develop. They require a unified, sustained political commitment from the company, all the way up to top brass.<p>Netflix is able to develop shows because Netflix&#x27;s core business model involves shows. Original/exclusive offerings are seen as key to maintaining its share of subscribers against would-be competitors. There is a direct correlation between Netflix&#x27;s content selection and Netflix&#x27;s subscriber base. Microsoft, on the other hand, is a much larger and more diversified business, with a more complex org structure. XBox is one division of many, and XBox Entertainment Studios was one group of many under the XBox aegis. It&#x27;s hard to argue, at the C-level view, that XBox Entertainment Studios was core to Microsoft&#x27;s business. And I can&#x27;t imagine it was ever going to secure the sort of long-term, serious commitment that it required. In some ways that&#x27;s a shame. In other ways, I totally get it.",1405619965

If these technologies can be applied to ads then it helps justify large costs because it&#x27;ll increase revenue, but that is not the sole driving motivator for their moonshots and research.<p>Hopefully the percentage of people who are passionate about futuristic concepts and visionary ideas will rise in the near future. The faster we get to a post-scarcity society the greater chance we, as an intelligent species, will have to survive long-term.<p>Just my 2 cents. I love them as a company and have a huge amount of respect for what they&#x27;ve done and for sticking to their founding principals of transparency and &quot;do no evil&quot; (for the most part, within reason for a company of their size).<p>I know it&#x27;s pretty subjective and irreverent to bring Apple into any Google debate, the amount of people who put them on a pedestal drives me crazy.

But if the emulator is too slow, then, there is nothing you can do except report it to the user.<p>The graphics are done on an ordinary timer which redraws based on the cached video state from the audio callback. JSMESS could probably do the same.<p>You&#x27;ll always have a serious problem when there is more than one timer.

8049060,comment,8043655,8047751,1,0,eridius,,,"> Doesn&#x27;t OCaml have full memory safety?<p>I have no idea. Note here that &quot;full memory safety&quot; in Rust includes data shared between multiple threads, and includes protection against data races. Garbage collectors help avoid referencing free&#x27;d data, but if OCaml lets you share mutable data between two threads, then I doubt it&#x27;s fully memory-safe (at the very least that suggests you can get data races).<p>> Why is a garbage collector problematic, in this context?<p>What, in the context of server-side software? I don&#x27;t know if it necessarily is, but it&#x27;s definitely problematic in other contexts. And I do know that there have been issues with other languages causing unpredictable performance on servers because of garbage collection, e.g. ending up with a big GC pause after some N requests. I hope OCaml doesn&#x27;t have that problem, but I don&#x27;t know.<p>> It boils down to fine-grained control over performance, I guess. But, again, I don&#x27;t see how that is a plus in this context.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what specifically you&#x27;re referring to in that second sentence. Just the general ability to have better control over performance? Having that ability typically is a plus even in the context of server-side software because it means you don&#x27;t need to change languages just to write the performance-critical aspects of your software. Of course, using the same language is only a good idea if the language is also a good choice for the parts of the software that aren&#x27;t performance-criticial. My claim is that Rust is indeed suitable for the rest of the program too.",1405619667

But nothing they created contributed to Android, so they shouldn&#x27;t be extorting money from Android vendors.<p>The patents that Microsoft has been willing to assert publicly against Android are dominated by FAT patents which describe a system for working around the limits of Microsoft&#x27;s own file system. Nobody wants to use Microsoft&#x27;s file system for its own merits -- plenty of free systems exist that have none of its drawbacks and Android uses them internally. Android uses FAT only to interchange information with Microsoft systems and others based on their backwards filesystem. The patent system has been abused to allow Microsoft to block compatibility without contributing anything technological. It&#x27;s a classical failure mode of the patent system which was supposed to promote innovation and publication, not vendor lock in.",1405618786

If the number keeps going down it is certainly a problem, but if it heading back up it is fine.<p>The housing crisis is a perfect example of this. It only became a problem for people who bought more house than they could afford with hopes of selling at a moments notice. My house was as much as 50k underwater (going based on foreclosure sales of identical townhouses) during the crisis. Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t buy more house than I could afford. I could easily continue to pay my mortgage each month and was never anywhere near bankrupt. I sold the house recently for closer to 10k loss. Was I insolvent when the house was down 50k? No.<p>[1]Cash flow insolvency involves a lack of liquidity to pay debts as they fall due. Balance sheet insolvency involves having negative net assets—where liabilities exceed assets. Insolvency is not a synonym for bankruptcy, which is a determination of insolvency made by a court of law with resulting legal orders intended to resolve the insolvency.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency</a>",1405618773

That&#x27;s when you get a model that describes it&#x27;s training data very well, but doesn&#x27;t generalise well.<p>The thing about using lots of data is that prior to publication of  &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data&quot; in 2009, most people did think that good algorithms were the most important thing. What that research showed was that a bad algorithm given more data will eventually outperform &quot;better&quot; algorithms, at least when those algorithms are initially judged based on their performance on smaller datasets.<p>So what happened with neural nets was that after some initial excitement about how they were more like the human brain, etc., it was found that &quot;stupider&quot; algorithms actually performed better and ANNs were written off for a while. It turns out that the reason NNs were performing badly was that they weren&#x27;t being fed enough data.<p>Nowadays it&#x27;s pretty easy to saturate a feed-forward neural network with data to the point where it&#x27;s performance will never get much better. Deep learning techniques allow you to train bigger and more complex models with more data, but these more complex neural nets won&#x27;t perform very well unless you feed them <i>tons</i> of data.<p>So in reference to your point about the brain, the thing about brains is that they actually learn based on massive amounts of data too. Think about how much data you have from continually streaming video ~16 hours/day, plus sound, plus touch, proprioception, and other inputs, over the course of many years.<p>Deep learning tries to emulate this to some degree with &quot;pre training&quot; which is where you feed lots of data into a deep network and have it learn &quot;something&quot; (it learns by itself at this stage). Then you start teaching it more complicated, high-level concepts. This pre-training allows it to do things like recognise common patterns in images, which the later training allows it to then associate with semantic ideas like &quot;this is an apple&quot;, &quot;this is a person&quot;, etc.<p>TL;DR: What seems to work best is fairly &quot;dumb&quot; algorithms, scaled up to be able to handle vast amounts of information and fed a ton of data to learn from. This is also how the human brain works.",1405618563

And if the goal is to broaden the conflict, a Malaysian Airlines flight is a pretty odd choice when there were numerous other flights operated by big western airlines (British Airways, Lufthansa, etc.) also flying in the area.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that Ukranian officials have specifically said that Russian-backed rebels shot the plane down. We shouldn&#x27;t accept those statements uncritically, but they&#x27;re out there and they are worthy of some consideration.

The number of application domains where even soft real-time GC is inappropriate is very, very small. And designing freedom from garbage collection into a language (other than the simple option of allowing manual allocation/deallocation) is not cost-free, either, and can weigh down the design, too. You can optimize your language design for having garbage collection or for not having garbage collection, but if you try to do both at once, a language design that specifically favors one or the other will likely beat out the compromise solution for the case it&#x27;s optimized for.<p>And yes, that means that Nimrod (or any other language) won&#x27;t be perfect for everything under the sun.

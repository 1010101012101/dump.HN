Have you never put strings into a byte buffer?<p>But that doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s say you are correct: when working with strings, you more often want the rune length. It still wouldn&#x27;t be the right decision, given the other design decisions of Go, because it would have needlessly complicated things with only arguable benefits. Let me show you what I mean.<p>The len() function works with a whole lot of things: strings, arrays, slices, maps and channels. For the first three, len() returns the number of bytes involved. This is because all three are backed by an array, and so sensibly have similar semantics. It would have violated the principal of least surprise for anyone who knew the language to have an array-backed storage not return a byte count. Both the language developers and the users of it would have to special-case strings, in code and in their brains.<p>Now, they could have decided to do it anyway, but then another surprise awaits. What happens when you take a slice of a string? Oh no, more special casing and more complication for everyone.<p>The Go developers do special-case where doing so would clearly be a win for their users. Consider range, which iterates by runes over a string, potentially moving the index on the underlying array forward by more than 1 on each pass. That is clearly going to be the most common usecase the user is going to want and so was worth doing. It also eliminates many of the usecases where getting the length of a string in runes would matter to you. Not all, but a lot.",1373334400

Are you fucking serious? For a start, both the executive and the FISA court are operating under the pretense that said court is actually an independent part of the judiciary and not merely the equivalent of the NSA&#x27;s legal department, as you&#x27;re arguing.  This pretense allows them to issue blanket warrants like the leaked one for all Verizon call records and hold companies in contempt if they fail to comply. It also allows them to provide warrants for all kinds of activities that&#x27;d be outright unconstitutional by themselves. These are powers the executive doesn&#x27;t legally have on its own.<p>Is it so unreasonable to call their bluff and demand that, if they&#x27;re acting like a court and being treated like a court, we should get the same level of transparency we&#x27;d expect from any other court?",1373332815

The only reason Nintendo is still alive nowadays is because of their portable consoles business. That&#x27;s where they go unchallenged.

It was one of the worst Nintendo launches EVER.<p>Even if the games come on WiiU, it&#x27;s too late for Nintendo. There will be fantastic-looking games for the PS4 (and XBox one) which will catch the attention of gamers for a while.

Granted, I&#x27;m an engineer, but all I&#x27;ve got for data is my own mind, so here&#x27;s my anecdotal evidence.<p>The concept of keypairs doesn&#x27;t seem hard to me. And I think that can be abstracted away a bit anyway. You just need to know that there&#x27;s this super-secret file (the private key) that you should never leak to anyone, and you need to sync it to your devices. So far, not so bad. As for the public key, I think the software can mostly just handle that for you. I.e. it can take care of uploading it to keyservers.<p>Signatures might be harder for people to understand. But here still, a good UI could help to abstract that away a bit. Imagine I can just click &quot;get my key signed,&quot; enter an email address, and that&#x27;s it on my end. No more steps for me to take. On my friend&#x27;s side, it&#x27;s just an email that comes in, probably with a link using the application&#x27;s special protocol. My friend clicks the link, her PGP UI boots, and a yes/no pops up. Done.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that understanding the mental model is the bottleneck right now.

Face it, it's not the most financially rewarding career and the hours are probably worse than anything but Ob/Gyn professionals.

Most normal people want a solution now.<p>We're trying to mitigate that where we can; for instance a pledge is a 30-day commitment (rather than a perpetual one).  If nothing satisfactory is released in that time, the money can be easily withdrawn.<p>Regardless of what we do, there's going to be less ""normal people"" contributing to projects than the number of normal people actually using the stuff after it's gone through the process.  Our hope here is that our search and drilldown options (and some other stuff in the works) will help the normal people find what they're looking for after it's released.  We think ""finding-the-right-software-for-X"" is a big open problem, and we'd like to take a crack at it.",1226797037

""It's rare to see non-coders visit an OSS bounty site and create a bounty.""  There's a good reason for that: normal people are going to look for something that does what they want, <i>now</i>, not go through all the hassle of bounties and other things only to possibly see some code who knows when.<p>Maybe the site can be 'salvaged' by doing some creative tweaking to make it into something else that is a little bit more likely to make money?  Good luck in any case!",1226796463

365657,comment,365271,365632,0,0,silencio,,,"But pretty much any browser can display PDFs just fine without having to open a separate reader, and that's the defacto format for documents on the web. Occasionally you will come across other formats like word or rtf, but there are browser-based viewers for those formats available too.<p>I suppose that is what bothers me most about scribd. PDFs are easy to read for me in Safari, but when someone links me a scribd document, I gotta scroll both the document and the page or maximize my browser window to read a scribd document comfortably, I can't just have select text working without clicking a button, I can't view documents the way I want to (two pages side-by-side continuous). Sometimes they'll link me a scribd document of a PDF available widely from the original source, or a PDF of a webpage, and often it'll be outdated. And of course, Scribd is inaccessible with voiceover (the screenreader), which is absolutely not fantastic when the original document was fully accessible. Of course that wouldn't be a huge problem if it were simple to login, except with all the flashy web2.0 that's not terribly simple either.<p>You can make the point that I can create a scribd login to download files, but creating a new account on a site I don't even want to visit just to download something is irritating. Definitely not my definition of ""easily"" viewed or a ""good"" experience.",1226796442

365655,comment,365331,365617,0,0,ghshephard,,,"So, In a world of Networks that need to be built, customers that need to be deployed, ticketing systems that need to be improved, Post Mortems that need to be completed, and Network Architectures that need to be visioed - I simply don't have time/energy or, even the _ability_ to deal with someone who isn't going to throw themselves 100% onto the team.  And that starts at the interview.   Perhaps it's a reflection on how I perceived the employer/employee relationship.<p>The interview is a (very poor) proxy for what the work relationship will be like with the candidate in the future.  Firing people is such a major, major hassle (particularly as you get bigger) - that unless the person is grossly incompetent or breaches company policy in an unambiguous manner, you typically have to wait for the next round of layoffs to get rid of them, even if they are difficult to work with.<p>What this means, is that you are looking for all the danger signs you can during an interview - and hiring someone who is going to ""Stand up for their rights"" or ""as a matter of principle, not share detailed employee history"", is fraught with risk.  Both of those actions are entirely reasonable in and of themselves, but, for better or worse, they portend, for the potential employer, risk.<p>And I guess that's what I was trying to get across (from the perspective of an employer) - that rightly or wrongly, your actions in holding back information or challenging the employer in an interview, will be sending clear signals.<p>If you are a strategic hire, or if the job market is tight, or if you have some very, very specific skills - then you can probably afford to negotiate hardball, and be as difficult as you want - they aren't hiring you for the person that you are, but the things that you can do - but, in the 95% of the time a hiring situation is taking place, that is not the case.<p>[added: And as far as spamming references - ask anyone who hires; actually getting around to calling references of people you are _hiring_ is hard enough - I don't know if I have _ever_  contacted a reference unless a salary, start time, and position where pretty much agreed upon.  And I'm better than most at getting around to that task. ]",1226796394

365650,comment,365274,365455,0,0,time_management,,,"The US healthcare system is terrible. Although some argue that universal healthcare leads to long waits and difficulty getting appointments in some specialties, it's just as bad over here as it is in, say, Canada or the UK. We have all those problems to an equal degree... and medical bills, on top of that.<p>In Manhattan, some of the top doctors have stopped participating with insurance companies, because the companies (which are manned by the sorts of people who would be in guard towers of prison camps in other kinds of societies) often refuse to pay for bullshit reasons, leaving the doctor unpaid, or ""negotiate"" pay that is below subsistence level for the doctor. We've had a two-tier health system (insured vs. not) for decades, but now we're approaching a three-tier system (self-insured vs. crappily insured vs. not) because of the sliminess of insurance companies and the crappiness of their policies.<p>In addition, doctors have to carry malpractice insurance, the premiums of which are set, in large part, on a statewide basis. Base rates can vary by almost two orders of magnitude within a specialty, from a few thousand dollars per year to a few hundred thousand. The high-premium states lose doctors and it becomes almost impossible to get a specialist if you live in one of those states, with 3-month waits for appointments not being uncommon.<p>The US healthcare system is terrible; it's not just ""left-wing propaganda"" on the continent that says so. It actually is horrendous. Even many center-right Republicans are coming around to the need for an overhaul of the system.",1226795765

It's rare to see non-coders visit an OSS bounty site and create a bounty.<p>We're geared toward normal people funding the software projects.  Normal people don't want to compile sourcecode; we provide developers incentives for distributing binaries.  Normal people don't use wiki markup to describe what they want; we let them use a WSIWYG editor.<p>Normal people also use different platforms (mostly Windows and Mac).  Making binaries work across platforms (12 people want Windows, 5 people want Mac, 3 only care about the source...) and giving the developer the tools to field those platforms (Is there demand for a Mac port?  Is it worth my time?) is something that hasn't been solved yet by any bounty system I've seen.",1226795390

365632,comment,365271,365271,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Scribd for me is quite the opposite experience. I hate having my desktop littered with the pointless pdf's I've had to download to view. Instead, Scribd let's me take a quick look and then forget about it. If I actually want to download it, I have that option.<p>Also, I think a lot of folks forget that pdf is just one of the documents they convert. Many of their documents were originally Microsoft Office documents that they've converted to pdf and flash. Again - I'd much rather be able to take a peek at a MS Word doc than have to download it and open it with Microsoft Office on my mac.<p>For me Scribd makes browsing the web much more seamless. I don't get interrupted by having to download files and open them in another app, then close them, delete the file if I don't want it, then get back to browsing.<p>Given their user count and traffic, I'm guessing there are many others that feel the same way, but aren't as vocal about their experience because it's so seamless. It's a bit surprising to me to see such vitriol towards an app that provides free hosting to millions of documents converted from all different proprietary formats so they can be easily viewed.",1226794057

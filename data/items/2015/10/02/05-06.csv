10316940,comment,10316060,10316906,0,0,davemel37,,,"Not necessarily...<p>Here are the CAN SPAM rules...\n. But following the law isn’t complicated. Here’s a rundown of CAN-SPAM’s main requirements:<p>Don’t use false or misleading header information. Your “From,” “To,” “Reply-To,” and routing information – including the originating domain name and email address – must be accurate and identify the person or business who initiated the message.\nDon’t use deceptive subject lines. The subject line must accurately reflect the content of the message.\nIdentify the message as an ad. The law gives you a lot of leeway in how to do this, but you must disclose clearly and conspicuously that your message is an advertisement.\nTell recipients where you’re located. Your message must include your valid physical postal address. This can be your current street address, a post office box you’ve registered with the U.S. Postal Service, or a private mailbox you’ve registered with a commercial mail receiving agency established under Postal Service regulations.\nTell recipients how to opt out of receiving future email from you. Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting email from you in the future. Craft the notice in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand. Creative use of type size, color, and location can improve clarity. Give a return email address or another easy Internet-based way to allow people to communicate their choice to you. You may create a menu to allow a recipient to opt out of certain types of messages, but you must include the option to stop all commercial messages from you. Make sure your spam filter doesn’t block these opt-out requests.\nHonor opt-out requests promptly. Any opt-out mechanism you offer must be able to process opt-out requests for at least 30 days after you send your message. You must honor a recipient’s opt-out request within 10 business days. You can’t charge a fee, require the recipient to give you any personally identifying information beyond an email address, or make the recipient take any step other than sending a reply email or visiting a single page on an Internet website as a condition for honoring an opt-out request. Once people have told you they don’t want to receive more messages from you, you can’t sell or transfer their email addresses, even in the form of a mailing list. The only exception is that you may transfer the addresses to a company you’ve hired to help you comply with the CAN-SPAM Act.\nMonitor what others are doing on your behalf. The law makes clear that even if you hire another company to handle your email marketing, you can’t contract away your legal responsibility to comply with the law. Both the company whose product is promoted in the message and the company that actually sends the message may be held legally responsible.",1443765344

But almost any modern application has things that will be suited to a graph representation.<p>So I am considering a workaround to use a graph structure, but represent the underlying data in a reliable rdbms, in particular postgres.<p>The approach is:\n1. Make two parent tables: node and edge. \n2. Make separate tables for all &quot;objects&quot; (like people, places, things, etc.) which would be inherited from node, so they would all have a unique node ID. \n3. Make separate tables inherited from edge which would be used to represent the many many relations. So each relation has an edge ID, and each table inherited from edge can be thought of as representing a specific kind of relation (like person lives in place, or person is friends with person).<p>One thing I have observed so far, is a large number of tables with few columns, but I think that lends itself to the advantage of  easy indexing. There can be a large number of individual queries from the front end, but I believe I can use views to make represent tables with more comprehensive info to reduce the number of queries.<p>What do you guys think of an approach like this? What am I missing, what is wrong with it? I haven&#x27;t come across this previously, and so am a bit nervous about the ramifications. Is someone else also doing this?",1443763560

As it was, I sold it to someone via CraigsList for a few hundred bucks.<p>This is why I predict Apple will continue to dominate. Android and the Android ecosystem still have many of these same kind of lapses and warts.  My Nexus 7 is very greedy on battery and does not go into any kind of hibernation, which means that if I forget to charge it, it&#x27;s dead after two days with no use at all.",1443763053

The result of this is that it&#x27;s easy to have async code that all runs on the same thread (usually the UI thread) even while it calls a function makes a network request that gets scheduled to a background thread.<p>Go&#x27;s model doesn&#x27;t give you as much control over which thread a particular operation gets assigned to. It&#x27;s not theoretically impossible, I suppose, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine what a simple API for it would look like.<p>But yes, if this particular problem were solved in an elegant way, I would also prefer the CSP model.

This is a common problem among Vim articles and tutorials. Authors title them as if it will give you Vim mastery, but instead it only offers the basics.<p>Mastering Vim means going beyond vanilla movements and learning all of Vim&#x27;s nasty warts to replace good GUI features. It means learning the wonky, dead Vimscript language. It means knowing how to use the arcane arglist. It means knowing how to go into insert-normal mode, and when to use the expression register. It means knowing everything about very magic search, and why default search is poorly designed. These are all randomly chosen examples, because mastering Vim involves mentally juggling a very large playbook of oddball features to complete editing tasks.<p>The main resources to help you master Vim are the book &quot;Practical Vim&quot; by Drew Neil, and if you&#x27;re ever in the unfortunate position of needing to write or edit a Vim plugin, &quot;Learn Vimscript the Hard Way&quot; is invaluable <a href=""http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/</a>",1443762175

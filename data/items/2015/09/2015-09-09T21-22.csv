I&#x27;d like to think that while Rust may not have been designed to guarantee that leaks are prevented, it so happens that anything that <i>could</i> leak memory sticks out like a sore thumb in code review, since the code to get something to leak needs to be explicit. I&#x27;d consider a global variable or a channel that has the possibility of not reading all its values to follow that pattern. Whereas it&#x27;s much easier to get something &quot;stuck&quot; in memory without a reference in C++. But you&#x27;re absolutely right that memory safety does not at all imply &quot;leak&quot; safety, nor is the latter well defined at all!",1441835941

What I want to do: read things, highlight, scribble notes, diagrams, outlines, sync, search, etc. Basically I want something that completely replaces paper coming out of a printer. It seems like the younger people maybe are more adapted to digital documents, but I have very strong spatial memory for paper and can find things I&#x27;ve written or read in paper very quickly.<p>Surface Pro has this, but is overkill frankly. iPad, kindle, other tablets have not been sufficiently usable to actually replace a printed or blank sheet of paper. This device may fit that use case, but it inhabits a priced point that&#x27;s worse than Surface Pro. For some reason I&#x27;m waiting for something in the $200-300 price range to show up--things that are more expensive I feel like I have to protect and coddle. So, yes something like iOS definitely could work there. There are even some interesting eink devices that go after the paper replacement route. But they are also too expensive compared to Surface Pro.<p>Maybe this will be a big enough kick in the butt for Google to start supporting pen input in ChromeOS or Android (there are Android tablets that have pen input, but IIRC that support is plastered on top by manufacturers increasing support and integration costs significantly, so software updates don&#x27;t happen).",1441835932

It&#x27;s also unlocked, which could be nice for some people.<p>Here&#x27;s the big difference, though, at least with AT&T&#x27;s Next: With Next, the &quot;how often can you upgrade&quot; and &quot;how long do you have to pay&quot; are highly mismatched.<p>The most frequent upgrade plan is once very 12 months (&quot;AT&T Next 12&quot;). To get this, I have to commit to paying 20 months (or ~3.33 years).<p>If I want to upgrade two years in a row, I&#x27;ve committed to paying 40 months (2 terms of the plan). That at least gets me 3 upgrades in that term. If I want to go for a 4th upgrade, we&#x27;re now at an overall committed payment term of 5 years.<p>That&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re doing this long-term, but Apple&#x27;s appears much simpler: You pay for 2 years. In that time, you get 2 phones.<p>Verizon&#x27;s program lets you upgrade &quot;any time&quot; you want, but only once you&#x27;ve paid off the cost of the new phone. Unless you pay a chunk of change early, this means one upgrade every 2 years, just like a contract, compared to Apple&#x27;s once-a-year.<p>What I&#x27;m not sure about with Apple&#x27;s is whether you can end your 2 year plan with a second phone, and then terminate and keep the phone. This is what I&#x27;d most like to know before considering this further. The Terms and Conditions page doesn&#x27;t seem to be up yet..<p>Given that the upgrade is once every 12 months, timing also seems important. I&#x27;d imagine you&#x27;d want to activate the plan just after a new iPhone comes out, and hopefully time it so that you end the 2 years right after another new iPhone comes out, if you really want the latest-and-greatest.<p>Overall though, it <i>seems</i> to be more fair compared to AT&T&#x27;s Next and Verizon&#x27;s Early Upgrade programs.",1441835678

For example, it might be unreasonable to expect a minimum 5 year warranty on a typical consumer hard drive being hulked around in a laptop. It&#x27;s possible to build more reliable drives with better components and more robust cases with improved physical protection for those who need better resilience, but it makes the products more expensive, and the market has already provided for this with a range of different product types at different price points.<p>On the other hand, I have plenty of white goods in the kitchen of my home that have been working just fine for a decade and there&#x27;s no reason they shouldn&#x27;t be. Fixing a 5 year warranty period regardless of context might have been an open invitation to the manufacturer of my fridge to build in something that would break after 61 months (which seems a lot closer to what you seem to get with more modern kitchen white goods today).<p>I still think full disclosure is probably the best way to fight this trend. You can artificially cripple your device if you want, but like the warnings on cigarette packets, you have to use at least 30% of the space on your packaging prominently warning users that your product is deliberately broken and explaining exactly how so they can make an informed decision about whether they still want to buy it.

Yet there are enough stakeholders who <i>do</i> want the institution to persist for reasons of personal benefit (and enough taxpayers who want to imagine a cute moralistic story and are willing to pay for the luxury of ignorance), that a massive machine of oppression is created and sustained out of a simple, reasonable human want.<p>I&#x27;m not intrinsically anti-capitalist; I&#x27;m in the camp of Jaron Lanier, in that money, markets, and corporations are all technologies, and neither good nor evil. But technology should serve humans, and not the other way around; that means paying attention to the power of unchecked, autonomous feedback loops and their power to influence human behavior and our various social ecosystems.",1441834751

The auctioneer simply ends the auction when people stop bidding.<p>The only way to fix the sniping problem is to fix this fundamental issue with online auctions. They need to make it so that auctions can dynamically end at any point in time (for example, if the item hasn&#x27;t been bid on for a set time window, or if the seller is simply tired of waiting).<p>Imagine if you wanted to sell an iPhone or something with this type of auction model. People would place bids up front, and they would have a fast-paced bidding war (driving up the price), followed by a slower bidding war, as they started to reach the limits of what they were willing to pay. If nobody topped the current bid during the following 24 hours, the auction automatically ends, and the highest bidder wins it. Placing a bid automatically resets the 24 hour delay (or maybe it resets it to an exponentially smaller time window to keep people from postposing an auction indefinitely).<p>I&#x27;m imagining a scenario where the person who creates the auction can set the auction automatic no-bid termination time window, and they could also set a true deadline (which perhaps only they would be privy to) when the auction would automatically end.<p>That is the only way bidding makes sense to me on online auctions.

So if you cut the screen in half, you save maybe 40% battery going towards powering the screen.<p>But then the screen is only a fraction of the power usage, let&#x27;s call it half. So cutting the screen in half drops battery usage not by 40%, but 20%. And then the screen is off half of the time while the phone is still using battery, which is why it&#x27;s even lower than that.<p>So half as big a screen might reduce total battery usage of the phone by say 20-30% tops. And that&#x27;s without taking into account that  a big chunk of a phone&#x27;s internals are going to be non-battery (e.g. flash storage, cpu, ram) which don&#x27;t get bigger (or at least anywhere near 2x as big) if the screen is twice as big, and so the battery-to-volume ratio on a bigger phone is bigger than on a smaller phone.<p>In short, while yes obviously smaller phones have smaller screens that use less energy, overall bigger phones have better battery life because they have comparatively bigger batteries.<p>As for tablets vs phones comparison, it&#x27;s an apples/oranges comparison as they do different things but, no way.<p>If you want to make the comparison, top iPad has a 42 watthour battery, iPhone 6 has 6.9. About 6x battery difference, despite the fact the 9.7 inch vs a 4.7 inch screen. That iPad has 3x as many pixels to power but 6x the battery to do it.<p>But again, it&#x27;s apples/oranges.<p>Compare the iPhone 6 to iPhone 6 Plus. According to you the reason tablets get worse battery life is because they&#x27;re bigger and have bigger screens, which are the main battery sink. So the 6 Plus should have worse battery life, according to you under the same principle.<p>But it&#x27;s wrong, the iPhone 6 Plus has 60% more watthours of battery, despite being 32% bigger. And if you look at Apple&#x27;s references (usually pretty good), they rate for the Plus vs the standard iphone: 10 hours more talk time, 34 hours more standby, 2 hours more internet  time on 3G or LTE, 1 hour more on wifi, 3 hours more video playback and 30 hours more audio playback. Note the video (where the screen is one of the biggest battery sinks you can imagine), it&#x27;s got a battery lifetime of 27% more despite a 32% bigger phone, for all the above mentioned reasons that a percentage increase in screen size has a somewhat larger percentage increase in extra battery volume.<p>So I&#x27;d say that the notion that bigger phones have better battery life, in general, is true. And when choosing the plus version on the iPhone, the battery life is a benefit. While choosing say the mini version on android phones (even as they&#x27;re often underpowered, such as the Galaxy S mini series), tends to diminish battery life.",1441834364

Except in most brilliant designs, the more things you counter the more chips or energy you must use.<p>An example is a VPN where you have one node for trusted side (Red), one for crypto component, and one for untrusted side (Black). This is called Red-Black separation: used by many high-assurance, crypto devices. Having a node/chip/board each lets you make separation work to your advantage. The Red and Black nodes will each handle transport, input validation, conversion from complicated (i.e. standard) interfaces to simpler ones (esp non-DMA), and administration to a degree. The crypto node, running state machines for just security part, can be built on all kinds of hardware, have minimal onboard software, and use about as much security as you like. Such a combo of physical isolation, interface protection, and implementation simplicity lets you have confidence that even strongest attackers hitting Black node won&#x27;t steal data from Red. That&#x27;s three pieces of hardware at a minimum with more if you isolate crypto node&#x27;s logical functions (esp I/O).<p>Another angle comes from an approach I advocate against nation-states called Security through Diversity. The risk is that markets converge on a small number of hardware, peripherals, OS&#x27;s, etc. Nation-state resources are large & necessary targets are small. High odds of 0-day development. Also, increasing worries that modern stuff might be subverted by NSA, China, Russia, etc. Easiest way of dealing with this is to diversify one&#x27;s hardware (even processor types) and use portable software that cares not what it runs on. Plus lots of randomization and obfuscation. All this makes the job of getting from known software issue to working, stealth exploit harder. The best hardware choices are all old hardware or embedded which takes more hardware (i.e. servers, boards) to equal modern performance. Will use more space and energy.<p>Combining these two models will certainly use more space and energy. Plus, a lesson established by criminals and spooks alike is to treat all the equipment as disposable: constantly changing it. Sure someone might use it if you erase it and drop it off at a pawn shop, etc. The trend still causes more hardware manufacturing and waste, though.<p>So, there&#x27;s a few ways that security against High Strength Attackers trades against the environment. There&#x27;s some tradeoffs that can be made with MCU&#x27;s/CPU&#x27;s on low-power process nodes but development costs are prohibitive. New projects will likely combine existing ASIC&#x27;s onto boards with redundant, power-using components. That power usage itself is a security hole (eg side channel attacks) guarantees this.",1441834294

Since zero is a perfectly fine value for an `i32`, we have to store the discriminant separately.<p>But note that this is just a flat eight-byte value. There&#x27;s no heap allocation involved. It&#x27;s just as if you&#x27;d written in C:<p><pre><code>    struct O { enum { Some, None } discriminant; int32_t value };
</code></pre>
I compiled a program that uses `Option<Option<i32>>`, and looked at the DWARF debugging info to see what the compiler did with it. It seems to represent this as a twelve-byte value: four bytes for the discriminant for the outer `Option`, followed an eight-byte `Option<i32>` value laid out as before. Since you can get the address of a value held by an enum, I guess this makes sense; the compiler can&#x27;t combine the discriminants or do anything clever like that.",1441833983

That is, I start with a test, write a few lines of test code, make it pass, perhaps refactor, and write a few more lines of test. It took me a year or so to get from test-last to test first, but I love it now; it forces me to look at code from the external perspective. One way to put it is that it shifts my focus from internal mechanism to real-world meaning.<p>Another breakthrough was pair programming. The larger a code base gets, the more important readability and easy comprehension get. But at least for me there&#x27;s a real limit on how comprehensible I can make a piece of code on my own. I just know the internals too well to usefully model the reaction of somebody who neither knows the internals nor wants to. But pairing gives me (and allows me to give) continuous feedback on what makes sense and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>A third favorite is known as Domain-Driven Design [1], where one organizes the code around the actual concepts of a business domain. The larger a code base gets, the more possible places one might look for a particular piece of code.

Messengers these days are a dime and a dozen, with Facebook&#x27;s messenger being popular because it is &quot;at hand&quot;, but that&#x27;s due to people being active on Facebook. But it&#x27;s not like Facebook has multiple products, their messenger being part of what Facebook is. Before Facebook my friends where using Yahoo! Messenger. And now it&#x27;s pretty much dead.<p>&quot;gchat&quot; was actually Google Chat and was about voice and video chat. Now it was replaced by Google Hangouts. It&#x27;s a pretty cool service, except that they have had two problems - their fuckup with Google+ and the popularity of Skype. Now Skype is a very memorable brand. And it has lots of problems, but people keep using it because it works for group video/audio calls and because it has good prices on calling phone numbers - like, Skype has a freaking monopoly on emigrants and their families or on companies working with remote consultants or employees.<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t think the actual name matters that much, plus if you pick a weird word you might get more out of it. Googling is now a verb in the dictionary and tweeting should probably be as well.",1441832424

So time literally stops [...] so actually you can’t reach the event horizon.<p>I think this is completely wrong. Isn&#x27;t the curvature at the event horizon large but finite? The curvature is only infinite (in theory) at the singularity.",1441832405

Standalone Android TV devices just don&#x27;t make a lot of sense because there&#x27;s no demand for them. Consumers trust Apple to make shitty experiences less shitty, so until Apple leads, there is no market. It&#x27;s the same as it was (is?) for tablets: there&#x27;s not really a market for tablets, but there&#x27;s a market for iPads. I think that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ll see with the Apple TV.",1441832402

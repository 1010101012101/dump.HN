A rational actor should make the best decision they can make given the information they have at the time, place their bets, and take their chances.  The article clearly made it seem like having a pop (as differentiated from having a higher stock price) was a favor that Twitter was doing investors, and that somehow this favor would be repaid by market at large via some mechanism that&#x27;s totally mysterious to me.  I&#x27;m honestly really baffled that this meme gets repeated so much, and I&#x27;m open to explanations.<p>Dutch auctions <i>do</i> sound good in theory, and I&#x27;m aware of what happened with Google&#x27;s: a 17% pop, which left some money on the table, but much less than Twitter did.  Google&#x27;s stock did abnormally well in the months following, but it&#x27;s hard for me to divine how much of this had to do with the IPO mechanism.

They could also see your browser and OS, but that is not even remotely unique or descriptive about you as a person.<p>On the other hand, if you sign up with a personal e-mail address, a site admin could realize that some &quot;5.5.5.5&quot; IP making unusual requests is also &quot;john.smith@gmail.com&quot;, and infer further things about you based on that.<p>The same goes for if your emails are leaking your IP address unbeknownst to you.

If you sent the email from a coffee shop, they will know the shop&#x27;s company&#x27;s name and a rough location, and could infer the precise location based on that.<p>For a personal email like &quot;jim@mit.edu&quot;, this isn&#x27;t a concern, but if you perhaps have an email you use when you want to remain anonymous or semi-anonymous on the internet, often you won&#x27;t want that kind of information disclosed.<p>And from a security perspective: if you are hosting some kind of a server from that IP address, it could be scanned or attacked.

I think it supports the notion of firing by team - if anyone can measure the worth of an employee, it is their direct line manager, who is responsible for giving them work and judging the timeliness and quality of the outcome. However, as this &quot;measure&quot; is essentially incomparable between teams, it can&#x27;t be effectively extrapolated to form a company wide view of the &quot;bottom 10%&quot;. Asking each manager to get rid of their least effective employee both spreads the cuts evenly across skill sets, while ensuring that the measure of employee worth is being made by the most qualified person to do so.<p>> I wonder how things would look if they went by seniority, and simply fired the last 10% to join<p>Well, like firing by team, it is just another arbitrary measure.

6700844,comment,6699146,6700401,1,0,smegel,,,"Nice in theory, just doesn&#x27;t work in practice. There are two main problems with company or even divisional stacking:<p>One, inter-team comparative rankings are essentially meaningless. Imagine you have two teams of roughly equal competence. When asked to rank employees one manager is a bit of a soft touch and gives all his team members good-high rankings. The other is a bit honest and ranks most in the middle, with some low and some high. Some managers might be weak, others lazy, or may simply have a difference understanding of the rankings to other managers. The result is that the group people who get let go are arbitrarily determined by incomparable manager rankings - when you look at it this way, forcing every manager to fire their least effective employee is a blunt, but fairer approach. Of course if you have some magic formula to truly discover the bottom 10% of an entire company...maybe in a call center where everyone can be measured by calls/day...but in a software company what would you do? Measure people by KLOCs? That craziness ended in the 80s (except maybe in IBM). At the end of the day manager rankings (and perhaps peer rankings like MS) are all you have - and as they are essentially incomparable, what else can you do? If you have a better way, you should start a management consulting firm.<p>Two, when a company is engaging on a total staff reduction, it needs to spread the cuts otherwise it might see entire crucial areas and teams disappear. I think we can all agree here that sales/corporate/IT are generally far less effective employees than engineers, but a company can&#x27;t just fire its entire sales division. That fact alone, by definition, implies that some more-competent staff will need to be fired while less-competent ones are kept, simply to maintain a necessary skill balance. Firing by team is an effective, if crude way to reach that goal.<p>I think this is one of those areas where you have to accept there are no easy answers, and the &quot;least worst&quot; solution is the best one.",1383977493

Innovatively or Hacking it?",,"So from where I research you cannot parse the BCC address off an email in transit (Sendgrid, Cloudmailin, Mailgun... etc)<p>I am trying to think of another way where you, original@email.com, can BCC content to user@email.com - it auto manually-forwards (<i>) to general_inbox@email.com;<p>Open general_inbox@email.com, you would see FWD: Subject Line from user@email.com<p>(</i>) Manually-forwards would be where the email landed inside user@email.com&#x27;s inbox. Forwards it with FWD to general_inbox@email.com; However, the cPanel forwarding rules are duplicating the email where from is still original@email.com and not user@email.com....<p>Working off this, is there some way to still fetch the BCC? Or is there another innovative approach I cannot think of?<p>Final piece to my app.<p>Thank you!\n-Gary",1383977304

The only time I would tip exceptionally is if someone went really above and beyond, or did something against policy, and in a lot of customer support cases, a cash tip separately is a better solution there.  Or, if it is just exceptional service , calling the employee out by name to management a few layers above.",1383977179

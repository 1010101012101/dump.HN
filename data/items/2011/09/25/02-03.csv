Apply that legal principle to the facts in <i>Benson</i> and you get the opposite result from what the Supreme Court said.  Like the dissent in <i>Alappat</i> said, it was inconsistent with precedent.  The special-purpose machine idea was so far out there that I don't think anybody believed they really meant it until they reiterated it in <i>State Street</i>.<p>As for rejecting State Street, I'm just looking at the Syllabus on the first page of <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-964.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-964.pdf</a><p>Abbreviated quote: The en banc court rejected its prior test...see, e.g., State Street...holding instead that this “machine-or-transformation test” is the sole test for determining patent eligibility of a “process” under \n§101, the court applied the test and held that the pplication was not patent eligible.<p>Held: The judgment is affirmed. [end abbreviated quote]<p>The Syllabus makes it sound like they're actually positive on this test, at least for processes, and that the lower court made the right decision to use it as the sole test and ignore, e.g. <i>State Street</i>.  (The Fed Circuit also mentioned Alappat specifically.)<p>It does get more confusing once you get past page 1, and I see where Kennedy says what you say about the non-exclusivity of the machine or transformation test.<p>However, I do see a lot of endorsement of paying attention to <i>Benson</i>, <i>Flook</i>, and <i>Diehr</i>.  Combine that with the explicit non-endorsement of <i>State Street</i> and I think it's clear what the Patent Office should pay attention to.  Software patents today if evaluated according to the precedent in <i>Flook</i> would generally be rejected.",1316919442

3034919,comment,3031841,3034485,1,0,grandalf,,,"Your proposed explanation is a very incomplete version of what was actually going on.<p>It depends on what the purpose of the assets was on a company's books.  In some cases marking to market makes sense and in others it doesn't.<p>In the case of assets used as reserves (companies are allowed to use securities as reserves for underwriting risk) marking to market means that when the underlying commodity has a bubble, the firm suddenly has significantly greater ability to take risk... then if the asset price falls the firm is suddenly way over-extended.<p>If a firm is responsibly underwriting its own risks, the firm's accountants will determine which assets are suitable and which are not. However in a heavily regulated, heavily subsidized financial system like the US, firms have an incentive to take the maximum risk allowed by law, with the expectation of below market rate loans or other bailout assistance if the practice turned out (in hindsight) to be too risky.<p>In the post financial modernization act boom, firms found ways to treat all kinds of risky assets into reserves, and regulators believed that it was nearly impossible that housing prices would fall more than a few percent.  The cabal of large firms and regulators squeezed additional returns out of various schemes for a few years, while shoving significant systemic risk (all built upon the assumption that housing prices would not fall significantly) into the corners and tranches of all sorts of complex products.<p>I'd argue that any complex financial system will ultimately result in coordination to ignore inconvenient systemic risk.",1316919287

Good, good. That this wisdom invalidates Lean Startup theory, MVP, etcetera. Ok, controversial, but I can dig it. He alludes to the process he went through to nurture this wisdom, and how it has been subconsciously applied by many, to great success. Getting inspirational, I love it. Then he says that he won't be sharing what he's come up with. The end. Excuse me?<p>Sure, given the premise, I can do my own musing on the subject and come to my own conclusions. But I don't have the same degree of experience as this author. I don't blog about ""refactored perception"", I don't think about these sorts of things very often (I work in a <i>very</i> different industry), so I would love the insight of someone who does.<p>I'm interested in seeing the arc of his thinking, going from the initial abstract musing with calves and cows, to a fascinating new approach to practical process. That sounds like a great arc to see, even if I won't be following it myself.<p>In hindsight, this just feels a bit like Article Bait or Concept Bait (as opposed to link bait). It promises a ""refactored perception"", and delivers a ""redacted prescription"".<p>ADDENDUM: Yes, it's a great read. I really enjoyed reading it. It'll give me some good things to think about. But the ending is a complete cop-out, only conceding the tiniest hint that he might follow up on this in the future. I agree, better to not have the last section at all. Better still, to say that he will indeed write more if people show interest. I would love to read more about this.",1316919128

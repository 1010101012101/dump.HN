My impression is many of the HN crowd are in denial about this. Two or three years ago things did look very different.<p>Reflexively I often like to blame poor stewardship for the situation, but in more sober moments I&#x27;ve come to think that the way Android is distributed and the OHA operated is structurally unsound. The surprising aspect of it is just how successful Apple have been at cultivating an audience composed of the vast proportion of valuable customers, and had they not had such success then the open source Android may have worked out better.<p>This pisses me off massively because Android makes all sorts of more technically interesting end user apps possible, but with a business hat on if it can&#x27;t also be made to work on iOS it&#x27;s not worth doing.",1439855946

10076860,comment,10076412,10076575,0,0,kevin_nisbet,,,"I believe it also overstates or miss-represents the way the wireless telecommunications networks operate.<p>While I&#x27;m honestly not familiar with the SGES or all the rules the article is alluding to about decryption, \nI think this article also miss-represents the way wireless telecommunications networks work. The encryption used by networks such as UMTS and LTE are international standards specified by the 3GPP, and to my limited knowledge do not draw on DUAL EC DRBG in any way. However, my experience in this portion of the encryption is extremely limited.<p>Anyways, the encryption used by UMTS and LTE networks as specified by the 3GPP, are international standards, and are used to authenticate users SIM cards, and to protect the air interface for integrity and confidentiality. As such, the telephone communications should be difficult to intercept on the radio interface only, but when it enters the network the need for encryption is no longer needed.<p>To maybe draw a parallel to a web service, many load balancers offer SSL termination. SSL between the browser and the web server, is important to protect the connection between the client and any intermediate networks. However, once it get&#x27;s to the load balancer, many services will just pass the traffic internally without encryption. Many systems like connections to a database will may also not be encrypted. Once you&#x27;re within your own network, you don&#x27;t keep everything encrypted at every step. The cellular network can be thought of in a similar way, the encryption is used to bring the service into the network in locations where it can be intercepted from outside the network.<p>Now if you think of something like say Internet traffic, for you to visit hacker news. You phone or tablet, will activate a cellular connection, and will send packets to the cellular network. The radio connection will be encrypted, but it will be decrypted by the network, because Hacker News doesn&#x27;t know or understand the cellular encryption protocols, there are no end-to-end guarantee&#x27;s provided. Also, the cellular network will eventually turn into an IP network, and the IP routing headers will be needed for regular Internet routing. When it leaves the cellular network, it will just be IP traffic like any other Internet traffic. What you are protected from, is that someone following you around with a special radio, can&#x27;t listen in on your conversations, messages, etc<i></i>.<p>In the case of Hacker News though, SSL is used, so that regular Internet traffic is also encrypted at a layer above TCP/IP, and the contents will be unknown.<p>Anyways, I hope that made sense. The article may have a lot of merit about what&#x27;s going on, but in my experience it miss-represents how the mobile network operates.<p><i></i> To be fair, and what may be relevant, is the 3GPP did cripple cellular encryption technologies at one point, for use in countries with export restrictions if I remember correctly.\n<i></i> Also, at least the older encryption algorithms have known flaws. And there are also documentation of other flaws, such as being able to trick certain phones into using null encryption for example and then intercepting the radio traffic. Or getting the UE to trust a network that it shouldn&#x27;t be able to.<p>Now for the mandatory disclaimer, the information provided are my own views, and in no way represent my employer. I do work in the wireless telecommunications sector in Canada, and all the information I provided is available to the public if you know where to look.",1439855840

10076841,comment,10073724,10075459,0,0,cheald,,,"This was true several years ago, but the cost of solar has come down <i>substantially</i> even without considering tax subsidies, and is continuing to decrease at a healthy rate.<p>For example, Sunroof estimates that a 5.75kWh system would cost $21,500 before subsidies (about $15k after, but we&#x27;re ignoring that), and that it will save you (gross) $60,000 over 20 years in utility bill costs. You can either:<p>a) Invest that capital. At a stable 7%, after 20 years, your balance would be about $86.8k.<p>b) Purchase a solar system for that $21.5k, and invest the difference on your power bill each month. Assuming a base power bill of $200, and the 2.2% annual rate increase that Sunroof uses, you would invest $2400 the first year, $2452.80 the second year, etc. At the same 7% return, then in 20 years your investment balance would be $122.8k, and your power bills would continue to be $0. Remember, these numbers assume an unsubsidized system.<p>The gain comes from the fact that after the break-even point (at year 12), you are continuing to invest your power bill equivalent, rather than paying it to the power company, whereas in the non-solar case, the increased power bill will never earn you a return.<p>The downside is that it (with those numbers) takes 12 years for you to come out ahead, and solar tech is moving so fast that the opportunity cost of committing capital to solar <i>today</i> rather than investing it and then liquidating that investment <i>tomorrow</i> to pay for a cheaper and more efficient system may be substantial, but is arguably specifically unknowable. If you don&#x27;t offset your full cost, the numbers change a bit, as well (but you can certainly compute what happens at a 50% offset for a smaller upfront capital investment easily enough, as well). There are certainly scenarios in which solar is viable unsubsidized today, though.<p>Feel free to check my math and assumptions: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JoJxX5t7VmRhV1LDI1UFZ1-f_5yrX62ypS9Bi6AwfBs/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JoJxX5t7VmRhV1LDI1UF...</a>",1439855634

I think the reasoning is that small caps are there to preserve the capitals but not disturb the flow of the text, since it&#x27;s read as a word just like the words around it. Full caps do disturb the flow of the text because they are not words and not pronounced as words either.",1439855241

There are no  taxes on the heating fuel, or at that time.<p>(That 35 cent quote is from a story told to me 20 years ago.  I don&#x27;t know if heating diesel was ever that cheap?

Hydronic heating is really under utilized, especially on the west coast.  It&#x27;s a great, energy efficient way to heat a home.

A good first question for the contractor is what brand of 02 sensor he/she uses to calibrate the boiler.  If he doesn&#x27;t immediately come up with a answer, or looks confused--run. The second question should be &quot;could you write down the what a primary/secondary hydronic piping configuration would look like?&quot;  Verify he knows what a primary/secondary system looks like, and why it&#x27;s important.<p>Hydronic heating is vastly underutilized in the U.S., at least in California?

That agent was one of several assigned to the Baltimore Silk Road Task Force. The UC claimed to be a smuggler who specialized in moving substantial quantities of illegal drugs. In December 2012, Ulbricht set out to find a drug dealer on Silk Road who could purchase large quantities of drugs from the UC and directed his administrators, including Green, to assist. Green assisted the UC to establish contact with a buyer, who was an established seller of drugs on Silk Road (the Vendor). The UC and the Vendor negotiated a deal for one kilogram of cocaine for approximately $27,000 in Bitcoin, a digital currency that has no association with a national government, is difficult to track, and easy to move online.<p>> Without the knowledge of either Ulbricht or the UC, Green agreed to act as a middle-man for the Vendor and take delivery of drugs. As a result, the Vendor provided Green’s address to the UC as the place to which the cocaine was to be delivered. On January 17, 2013, an undercover U.S. Postal Inspector delivered the cocaine [very highly cut] to Green at his residence. Shortly after Green accepted delivery of the cocaine, federal agents with the HSI, DEA, U.S. Postal Inspectors and the U.S. Secret Service executed a search warrant at Green’s residence and recovered the kilogram of cocaine.

Resumes including words like &quot;systems&quot;, &quot;C++&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot; were considered <i>bad</i> because they received no offer.  You don&#x27;t really need the distributed systems guy who can write highly performant C++ and actually understands how to apply algorithms at a standard web dev job.",1439854302

As cumulative solar installations continue to grow, we will continue down the cost curve shown on slide 13 and that will be true for more and more people. Which means that subsidies today can actually lead to long term lower energy costs as prices continue to drop.

But that just makes them sightly silly to use, that&#x27;s all. That&#x27;s probably less than 5-10% of libraries. F# contains some sugar to gloss over a lot of ugly C# idioms so things generally work surprisingly smoothly.<p>What I find more confusing is C#&#x27;s <i>love</i> of mutation.

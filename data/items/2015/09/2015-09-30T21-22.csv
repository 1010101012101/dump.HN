Yes,<p>> &quot;the rule of thumb is that you shouldn&#x27;t spend more than 30% of your monthly take home on rent&quot;,<p>as they say, but that&#x27;s just a rule of thumb. What actually matters is how much money you end up with. For example, assuming taxes remove 30% of income (probably close enough; would need to look up federal and state tax codes to be precise),<p>1. A Zynga employee makes 147,000, loses 30% to taxes, spends 3,545 times 12 on rent, and ends up with 60,360 to spare.<p>2. A RadPad employee makes 120,000, also loses 30%, and spends 1,475 times 12 on rent, giving them 66,300.<p>In other words, while the Zynga employee spends 47% on rent, and the RadPad employee a mere 23% - less than half! - the difference is much smaller than that would imply. At the end of the year, the RadPad employee has an extra 5,940.<p>Certainly a significant amount of money, and noteworthy in that the person has a lower salary but still ended up with more income after taxes and rent, but the amount is in the single digit percentage of the salaries we are talking about here.<p>More importantly, the problem becomes more obvious if we look at second place after Zynga. Doing the same calculation on a Google employee, then we get that despite paying 42% on rent, the employee is left with 71,128, which is more than the RadPad employee.<p>In other words, looking just at % of take home spent on rent is a useful rule of thumb, but looking at the actual money is better, and it can lead to different conclusions than the article would imply.<p>edit: Perhaps the best conclusion from their data is that it actually doesn&#x27;t matter where you live, since salary actually compensates surprisingly well for location. Whether you work at Google or Zynga in SF, or RadPad in LA, you&#x27;ll end up with +- a few % of the same amount of money in your bank account anyhow.",1443649212

So, we do have good reason to believe that he&#x27;s covering something up here.  This could be further substantiated with physical evidence tying him to the envelope of money, etc.  In particular, to the curtain covering the body.  But there are also problems with Sneed&#x27;s story.<p>I&#x27;d say they should, if they haven&#x27;t already done so, gather physical evidence that corroborates Sneed&#x27;s story.  If he&#x27;s being honest, I don&#x27;t think Glossip was so perfect as to have left nothing behind.  I suppose they&#x27;d explain that away by saying that he managed the motel and might have touched any random thing, but having his fingerprints/hair/etc. on something connected to the body would make this a lot harder to explain away.<p>It looks to me like he&#x27;s lying and the juries appear to have agreed.  I wouldn&#x27;t care to execute someone on a case like that, however.",1443646956

On a piano, the long (white) keys are tuned to C for that. If you start on a D and just play the white notes up, it won&#x27;t sound right.<p>If you&#x27;re asking &quot;why is it tuned to C&quot;, it&#x27;s probably because C is the key that historically was assigned the letters without any sharps or flats. There&#x27;s no physical reason for this, it&#x27;s just a convention (as opposed to, say, octaves, where each octave is half the frequency of the previous).<p>If you&#x27;re asking why C got the letters without sharps or flats, I believe you have the Romans to blame for that. They did start with A for their scale without sharps or flats, but it was what we would now call &quot;A minor&quot;. Which leaves C as the major scale.",1443646894

Here we are and we are reinforcing the structural narrative that Stripe is about John and Patrick and Pinterest is about Ben. When the vast majority of what our companies do, 99.9% are done by people that are not us, right? It&#x27;s obvious when you say it but it&#x27;s very much not the macro narrative.

Sparrow. These are not OS X toolbar icons -- they're UIKit icons! They look as out-of-place on OS X as OS X ones would on an iOS device.<p>5. DaisyDisk. The UI here is very unique and usable. The mouse-over support on the file graph is actually very, very useful for determining where storage space is being used.<p>6. Transmit 4. I personally found Transmit 3's favorites interface and syncing interface to be more usable. The animations they've added slow down use and some buttons (e.g., disconnect) are far harder to reach than in T3.<p>7. Courier. While the interface is novel and interesting at first glance, I have to question how useful it is for repetitive tasks. I have not used the app, so I can't comment there, but more often than not fancy graphics get in the way of speed.<p>8. 1Password. This one I love. It's useful and very usable. I've used multiple versions of this program and the UI changes they've made with the current one far outshine the previous versions both in terms of appearance and usability.<p>My only gripe still would be with the browser plugin. I've tried setting up other less computer-savvy people to use it, and the menu does not make it immediately obvious to them which item to select to log in -- the top several options are too crammed together visually.",1292788524

When I try to explain math research to people, I too am left with strange looks.<p>I think most people honestly think that mathematicians sit around and multiply larger and larger numbers together.<p>Part of the problem of explaining the true nature of mathematical research is one of language. For example, I study Lie algebras and representations. People ask me ""What are Lie algebras?"" and pretty much the only definition I can give that is understandable is ""Lie Algebras are a kind of algebraic structure that is useful in many fields of science, including quantum physics."" This is an answer many people understand (on the surface), but it really doesn't say anything.<p>What's worse, most of the time, when we justify or explain our research, it is by connecting it to fields that the person may be more used to (astronomy, biology, physics, economics, etc.). But for those of us in pure math, we really do not think about these fields in our day-to-day work. That is, I study Lie algebras because of their beautiful structure and the interesting combinatorics behind them, not because they are useful in some other field.<p>So a better answer to the question ""What are Lie algebras?"" would be something like ""Lie algebras are vector spaces with additional algebraic structure that gives rise to beautiful and deep combinatorics. They occur naturally as certain sets of square matrices, and are a kind of generalization of the ideas of symmetry."" However, this is mostly unintelligible to most people who haven't taken some mathematics beyond calculus, and I find that it sounds condescending to a lot of people, which turns them off from listening to any more explanation.<p>What I've taken to saying lately in response to a question along the lines of ""What do you do in math research?"" is something like ""Mathematicians create new knowledge from existing knowledge. They take things that the human race already knows, and using only logic, they deduce new things. This allows them to find fascinating relationships all throughout the world.""<p>I find this response to be pretty good. It's mostly accurate, it's mildly interesting, and best of all, it's short.",1292786692

It's certainly not just that they look at an end product (analogous to, say, a product from a startup) but don't get where it came from. It's that most people fundamentally don't understand what I do. They think of math as the capricious monotony they were put through in grade school and can't fathom why anyone would consider dedicating a life to it. Most aren't even willing to try. My love of math is a very big part of me, and it's a part that very few people understand.",1292785391

Why would someone who is so worried about liability that they do not open up their wifi run a Tor node?<p>Alternatively: are you implying that a Tor node is ""more deniable"" than an open wifi?  If so, why?",1292785364

I guess I assumed that since we're talking about censoring nudity we were talking primarily about the US market.<p>This is getting off topic, but I don't think it was a bad movie, although certainly not his best. Despite the nudity, the film is strangely un-erotic. I think you are unfair about Kubrick's motives in making the movie. I also think there's much that can be said about the movie, For example: <a href=""http://www.collativelearning.com/EYES%20WIDE%20SHUT%20analysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.collativelearning.com/EYES%20WIDE%20SHUT%20analys...</a><p>Edited: Terrible grammar.",1292785205

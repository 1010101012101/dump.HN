A reduction in the quantity supplied will, of course, lead to an increase in the equalibrium price.  And the high equilibrium price is both why Follingstad&#x27;s eviction is so painful, and why they were (effectively) evicted in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s a textbook example of Why Rent Control Hurts Everyone, in one compact little story.",1426474771

I&#x27;ve spoken with the new tenant, who moved in at a rate of $2400 per month. I turned in my keys on Friday, they painted the apartment on Saturday, and the new tenant moved in on Sunday. Despite this being February, they rented the place so fast that the second half of the month was paid for twice.<p>The dollar and timeline figures here tells me one of two things:<p>1) they wanted to get rid of me, particularly, or...<p>2) they took a calculated risk based on their experience managing a great number of units<p>I&#x27;d bet heavily on #2, since this is a pretty typical story in NYC.<p>They tried to raise the rent 22% to something 29% above market rate. They weren&#x27;t able to get anything close to that rate for a new tenant. They will pull the same crap on this tenant next year too.<p>> More importantly, people who rent probably do not expect to stay in the same house or apartment for many years.<p>This is patently false.",1426474748

9209533,comment,9206674,9209021,0,0,mjfl,,,"The nature of violence has not changed. The class warfare you speak of has existed since the dawn of man. It just has been brought to the forefront of our issues now because there are no longer evil tyrants skinning people alive (outside of North Korea). To say otherwise is incredibly ignorant of history. You could take Ancient Rome, for example, as a place where class warfare was entrenched and a major force of change. Marx, of course, thought of the same kind of struggle. People try to portray the Nazis as the cartoonishly evil to explain what they did to the Jewish people but they forget that the 1920s-30s was a ruinous time for everyone except the mostly Jewish banker class who were able to transfer their currency out of the German marks before the hyperinflation. You had a situation where Jewish families were traveling around in carriages while people on the streets were starving to death. Conspiracy theories sprouted up. The National Socialist party (Nazis) were supposed to remedy such differences of wealth, and they did it in the most destructive way possible. The atrocities during the WWII were largely due to class warfare taken to an extreme level. That&#x27;s why I think you should be very weary when you refer to the situation that presents itself now as &quot;war&quot;. Most of violence in history has been moralistic violence, don&#x27;t fall for it. In any case, no, the nature of violence has not changed, though the costs have increased, which is for the better.",1426474704

What makes fairness to one a higher priority than the other?  If we have a limited amount of &quot;fairness&quot; to go around, I would rather hand it out to the people who would otherwise be displaced from their home, and possibly their city, than to the landlord who is already making a profit... just less of one than he/she could theoretically be making.  Or does having money and property ownership entitle you to more fairness?<p>Remember that property is also a limited resource, and all plots of property are not created equal.  Property ownership is an agreement between individuals and the state.  The state gives the individual some rights to the property, but is empowered to restrict use of that properly when it believes the public good is better served.  In theory, both sides benefit from that.  But, for now, landlords are trying to throw aside what many (myself included) would consider the public good, in the name of higher profits.<p>I&#x27;m personally not a big fan of rent control, but simply dropping it (and allowing landlords to drive trucks through loopholes such as this) alone is not a way to get ourselves out of our current housing mess.",1426474390

9209487,comment,9208897,9209333,0,0,randallsquared,,,"> The exact amount they can get away with depends on personal tolerance and your time value for money, but given how much moving sucks, in practice it&#x27;s quite a bit.<p>It is my experience, as you say, that rent tends to increase by  a small amount each year, usually about 2%.   Even people on fixed incomes tend to get cost of living adjustments, though, and the range is about the same as typical rent increases.<p>I do not see rents increasing by the amounts you suggest, which suggests that either all landlords since I started renting in 1991 have been leaving money on the table, or they can&#x27;t actually do this reliably.<p>I think there are several reasons why they can&#x27;t raise rents by 10% a year in order to keep people there, even though that extra money would be about what it costs to move:<p>Since the money it would cost to move grows only at inflation, by the second or third year it would suddenly be profitable to move, even for renters who really hated moving.  In order to avoid this, landlords would have to apply the rise only once.  But if they do this, then the market rate is just the higher one, and you could look at the initial lower rate as a promotion.  In fact, this is quite common in rental advertising!  Often it comes in the form of &quot;first month free&quot;, which is about of the same scale.<p>More importantly, people who rent probably do not expect to stay in the same house or apartment for many years.  In non-rent-controlled areas, rent is more expensive per month than buying the same sort of place, so if you intend to stay in the same location for more than a few years, there&#x27;s no reason not to buy.  As a renter, I&#x27;ve never lived in the same dwelling for more than three years, and when I move somewhere, I assume that I&#x27;ll be moving again in a year or two, as conditions change (job, relationships, etc).",1426473897

Deciding that you need a fatter paycheck at the expense of a renter who can&#x27;t afford your desire -- yes, desire, not need -- for more money... yeah, in my book that makes you an asshole.  Any rent increase that isn&#x27;t tied to an increase in costs (sure, maybe plus a few percent for profit) or a CPI/inflation increase is just greed, plain and simple.  Put another way: landlords who are already making a comfortable profit off their property don&#x27;t magically stop making a profit just because demand has increased.  But that&#x27;s not enough: people won&#x27;t say no to a chance at <i>more</i> profits, even if that has a negative impact on other people.<p>Listen, there&#x27;s no <i>reason</i> why all the landlords across SF <i>need</i> to raise rents.  They do it because they <i>want</i> more money, and know that demand is so high and that the high income earners in the area can afford it, and that there are enough of those types of people to keep the market going, at least for a while.<p>And, to be frank, I <i>could</i> keep affording an apartment in SF even if it got much worse than it is now.  But I wouldn&#x27;t want to live here.  The thought of living in a place populated by only the rich is entirely unpalatable to me.  The idea of lining the pockets of people who are displacing families and individuals who have been living in SF for years and decades... that&#x27;s disgusting.  After a while, if things don&#x27;t get better, I&#x27;ll give up and move somewhere else, and give my rental money to people more deserving.

If the next year the market price remains $1000/month, the landlord can still raise the rent on you because you&#x27;ll be reluctant (and possibly unable) to pay moving costs again.

Shell scripting languages are famously obtuse and underpowered, and we&#x27;ve thought about how to cleanly merge shell scripting with a real language. It&#x27;s heartening to see an attempt at it.<p>Ambiguous syntax is a sticking point. For example, say the user runs this:<p><pre><code>    [ 1 ]\n</code></pre>\nis this constructing a Python list with the value 1, or is it invoking /bin/[ with two arguments? It&#x27;s ambiguous! It looks like xonsh interprets it the first way. Any thoughts on this issue?<p>A related issue is the relationship between bash functions and Python functions. I&#x27;d be very interested to see how xonsh approaches this.<p>Also, here&#x27;s some unsolicited advise, from one non-POSIX shell maintainer to another: The claim that xonsh is &quot;bash-compatible&quot; is delicate.  Full bash compatibility requires your shell to be insane. E.g.<p><pre><code>   echo foo | cd /\n   cd / | echo foo\n</code></pre>\nIn bash, only the second line will change your working directory. Or consider this command:<p><pre><code>   * \n</code></pre>\nthis finds the first (for some meaning of first) file in your directory and invokes it with all other files as arguments. I tried it: xonsh doesn&#x27;t handle either of these &quot;correctly,&quot; which is to say that xonsh isn&#x27;t yet insane. That&#x27;s good news! On the other hand, this means it&#x27;s not really bash compatible.<p>IME nobody really cares about full bash compatibility. What they want is for their existing bash stuff to just work. Bash shebang scripts will just run in real bash, but that leaves shell-integration scripts: virtualenv, rbenv, etc. Supporting that stuff is one of the most common requests that the fish shell gets, and one of the most commonly cited reasons for not using fish.<p>Here&#x27;s a piece of rbenv&#x27;s bash integration: <a href=""https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/blob/master/libexec/rbenv-hooks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/blob/master/libexec/rbe...</a> . It&#x27;s short but there&#x27;s a lot of features being used: set, shopt, IFS, functions, etc. If you&#x27;re aiming for bash compatibility, that&#x27;s your target!<p>In the meantime, I suggest changing the language to express that xonsh is bash-like, not bash-compatible.

Many benefits, to both the economy and society at large, come from ensuring the populace in general is able to find stable housing. While San Francisco&#x27;s rent control may be too stringent for its own good, there are many reasons to support a more reasonable rent stabilization policy in a jurisdiction with unstable rental prices.",1426471242

It seems like that for any X, you can find people to assert that X is obviously the most important thing in the world, so anything else doesn&#x27;t matter. Fundamentalisms are mentally satisfying, because you always have clear answers. But they&#x27;re practically dangerous, because the ignored concerns don&#x27;t actually go away.<p>Land, of course, does not work like you imagine it does. See, e.g.,:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_tenure#Modes_of_ownership_and_tenure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_tenure#Modes_of_ownership_...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform</a><p>In addition to all that, you ignore that concepts like &quot;trade&quot; and &quot;law&quot; and even &quot;earned&quot; are all intrinsically social concepts. No man is an island. That doesn&#x27;t mean that property rights aren&#x27;t useful and important, but if you want everybody to agree on a particular set of rights, you&#x27;ll have to make a case that is more compelling than, &quot;my particular moral code says you must abide by my particular moral code&quot;.",1426471209

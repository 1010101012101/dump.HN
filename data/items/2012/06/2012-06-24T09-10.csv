Even if it's true, and even if it's your trans friends who Made You See The Light, etc. Not only is it an irrelevant fact, but it's a very frequent cover for bigotry (""I have a gay friend!"" ""I have a black friend!"" ""I know lots of women!"") and will never help your case.<p>There are a couple reasons for this. 1, it obviously didn't keep you from making whatever mistaken statement you made. 2, just because someone is part of a group does not automatically make them sainted evangelists of that group. In stricter terms, it's an argument from a false authority: your friendship with a small group of individuals does not make you (or them) an authority on the larger group under discussion.<p>> But call me old fashioned, we already have a word for ""cis-woman,"" the word is ""woman"".<p>Who is ""we"" and why do you assume you're included? Language drifts, and it drifts most particularly in subcultures. People discover needs to describe things that they do not immediately have words for and begin using new words. You can be as old-fashioned as you like; just don't prescribe how other people talk. You ain't no po-po for da lingo.<p>> If trans people really hate being labeled as ""different,"" just co-opt the word woman.<p>They did. That's when you didn't hear about them.<p>Think of it this way. A lot of people currently believe that gay people do not exist. I'm serious. They do not exist, and that is part of what justifies legislation against them. They're not trying to oppress people; they're trying to convince supposedly gay people to relinquish their traumatic past and return to the straight and normal. Laws that oppress a non-existent class don't really seem like oppression. Forcefully reminding us that they <i>are</i> a class and that they <i>are</i> treated differently <i>right now</i> has value.<p>I mean, really.

If a gigantic chunk of the developers are working on ASP.NET and J2EE I would be surprised if they did not transfer those skills to their own business when they open one. Stackoverflow is one such case to give an example. So in my opinion, Marco's premise is wrong even though it may be correct within his circle.",1340528785

The big www thing was slowing muscling in on newspaper classified turf but not enough of a threat. There was a sense of community like the Well or BBS dialup days of olde; people trusted it. I think people value routine and endurance and CL was/is? seen as a place to community exchange. The heavy text based simple Web 0.5 UI hasn't changed much since then and yet users still come like people still use vi or emacs. They all drank the koolaid! 20 yrs later, I hear all this talk of data/API entitlement and efficiency is the new Winning! I don't get it? If CL is so lame and inefficient why can't these smart young whippersnappers replicate such a model of community BBS? Grow/Roll your own, collect your own data as the article suggests.

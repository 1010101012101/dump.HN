8775255,comment,8773000,8775173,0,0,hellgas00,,,"Again how many stations exist? I&#x27;m not arguing the concept, I am arguing the feasibility. What is the cost for fueling at these stations? Solar panels generate electricity yet we don&#x27;t use them to power industrial operations because solar expensive! Just like H2 from electrolysis won&#x27;t be able to compete with industrial H2 production from coal. Also, what you&#x27;re suggesting is using predominantly coal to generate electricity from a traditional plant (~40% eff), then transmitting the electricity to a station (90%), then creating H2(60%). Compare that to coal steam reformation (75%) and transportation (80%, being conservative), the latter is far more efficient and cheaper.<p>And what infrastructure do you need? A gas truck with a pressurized tank on it. The cost of hydrocarbon based h2 will displace electrolysis in large scale production.<p>And your last point about distributed load efficiency gains, electric cars are already able to balance load and feed into a grid. It&#x27;s always going to come down to cost, I&#x27;m going to buy the cheapest h2 around and it&#x27;s going to come from steam reformed coal.",1419033538

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an anti-pattern; if anything I&#x27;d see it as a positive sign, as it indicates a project that&#x27;s under continued development and willing to investigate new technology.<p>Just as it&#x27;s vital to accept that business requirements will change during a project, and structure your methodology to accommodate this, the same is true of technical considerations. And the same solution applies, viz. Agile: break up any &quot;redesign&quot; into small steps that can deliver concrete benefits inside a two-week period. Don&#x27;t treat the &quot;transitional architecture&quot; as a temporary thing that doesn&#x27;t need to be good, doesn&#x27;t need documenting etc.; like with a big database migration, you make sure that at every stage it&#x27;s something that you can develop under, and you know what you&#x27;d do if you had to abandon the plan at any stage.<p>If you try to keep a codebase on 2003 tech forever, you&#x27;re storing up trouble for later; devs will become harder to find and more expensive to hire, and eventually you&#x27;ll be forced into a Big Rewrite, and we know how those turn out. Like with deployment, better to embrace Continuous Re-Architecting. If it hurts, you&#x27;re not doing it often enough.",1419033523

It&#x27;s a branch of Mahayana Buddhism, it&#x27;s practised as a religion, in some regions it still has the aspects of Guru and Deity worship that have been inherited from the larger schools. The full name of the religion is Zen Buddhism.<p>As someone who has been involved with the religion and with Japanese friends who are also a part of it, it&#x27;s incredibly belittling when this idea gets spread around. It&#x27;s only in the West that all of the cultural and religious background has been stripped out and turned into a marketing device.<p>I often joke that if Buddhism had more extremist members we&#x27;d have a lot more holy wars than anyone else. Dressed up Buddhas, Zen stapled onto every two bit startup and cheap product, blogs about consumerist driven minimalism selling themselves as &quot;Zen&quot;. It really is ridiculous. What is being done here is just as offensive to eastern cultures as if an East Asian startup branded itself using Christian or Islamic imagery or terms, citing that it&#x27;s all just &quot;philosophy&quot;.<p>Anyone stealing these terms and imagery really should read some of the critiques of Western misappropriation of Eastern &quot;Spirituality&quot; like &quot;The Scientific Buddha&quot; or &quot;Selling Spirituality&quot;.

For example, to learn web dev a student might propose building a SaaS app.  He would ask relevant faculty to mentor him and peers to work on it with him (devs, admins, designers, ).  The team would elect a leader and have regular checkins with their mentors.  The only job the mentors have is to help the team succeed.  If they want to do their own research or work, then they should encourage a student to find a team and propose it as a project.<p>Each student could do 8 projects over 4 years.  If one takes off, they&#x27;re in a position to take a break and try to make it as a startup.  That&#x27;d be encouraged by their mentors, and ownership / IP would be structured to benefit the students with a slight stake for the mentors and university (< 5%).<p>This would provide many real world skills (what you&#x27;re doing in the project, leadership, working with others, etc).

Save me, mighty failcats! Wherever else in CS do we accept such blatant approximations, instead of The One And Actual True Computational Result&quot;. And you would be mostly right (except for anything floating point).<p>The reality check is that neither Windows nor MacOS ambushed anyone with overnight with case-insensitivity. It&#x27;s been there (as the default, right?), since &quot;forever&quot;. Git officially supports Win & Mac. Git design already protected .git/config, just not in a sufficiently effective manner (as far as 2/3ds of their major distribution platforms are concerned - yes, the defaults are what you should assume everyone has). [1]<p>Fun estimate: A lot of technical/knowledgable MacOSX folks, especially in the Webdev/webdesign/etc industries, will have been vulnerable to this despite their personal preferences. Adobe Photoshop (and the others of the creative suite, I think) had a certain idiosyncratic behaviour[2] when certain conditions were not met[3]. You paid thousands for that broken installer/support and Richard Stallman weeps for you.<p>[1] Aside: You think Git is getting shafted by Windows/Mac implementation idiosyncrasies in <i>this case</i>? Then you&#x27;ll love the favourite issue node.js on windows: &quot;Breaks on large projects&quot;. This is essentially a side-effect of solving the dependency hell problem effectively - by nesting dependencies under a node_modules directory on both project and dependency levels - and insufficient intelligence to foresee that preserving path length is a viable goal in software design (in 200X, no less). Because, in sufficiently bloated projects, you can have enough nested node_modules/$name/node_..., that you literally blow Windows&#x27; fuse. But it&#x27;s not a big deal, because that max path length is like some huge number, like 2^32 or some shit. Righ - 260 characters. 257 and C:\. Including slashes and all. So when node.js picked the completely reasonable &quot;node_modules&quot; as a dependency includes dir name, they should have known better - that their project would attract a huge audience and that sufficiently complicated/bloated packages would be created and distributed that their depencency-includes-dir-name selection would become a show-stopper, because one of our favourite OSes is still eating glue in the corner. And what didn&#x27;t actually work? Not node. Not npm. Windows Explorer and other tools/utils that weren&#x27;t updated to support NTFS&#x27; actual maximum path size - 32K. On the one hand, node.js github issues piling up (&quot;FIXITTT!!!!&quot;) and on the other, Microsoft says &quot;NTFS supporting 32K path length, while Windows Explorer supporting 260 chars, is not a bug.

When I walk away from the tree, taking with me, the cherry - what happens if I still use the tree in my mind to represent the concept of fruit? It&#x27;s a choice function. Does it matter whether I remember these things using sounds, symbols, images, experiences, or feelings? Language is interpreted and expressed across and using all of these domains. A poem carries greater meaning than the words do individually, and that is because there is emotional association that maps to the selection of words. We don&#x27;t really call &#x27;emotion&#x27; language, nor do we call &#x27;art/music/math&#x27; language, yet these things arguably can have a strong influence across how we &#x27;know&#x27; what language represents.",1419031311
8775140,comment,8772422,8775084,0,0,Osmium,,,"> Learning that the uncertainty principle gives rise to phenomena that popular science calls &quot;wave-particle&quot; duality was taught to me in quantum 101.<p>Agreed, just to expand on that: The hand-wavey relationship between wave-particle duality and the uncertainty principle was taught to me like this...<p>Imagine you have a sine wave. It has a well-defined momentum, p, given by its wavelength. However, since it&#x27;s infinitely periodic in space, it has no well-defined position, x.<p>Now consider a wave-packet[1]. This has a very well-defined position, given by the centre of the packet, but no well-defined wavelength/momentum.<p>These are the limiting cases. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ΔpΔx >= ħ/2, just quantifies this relationship. If you try and measure x, the wavefunction ends up more &#x27;packet-like&#x27; and you can no longer measure p as well, and if you try and measure p, the wavefunction ends up more &#x27;wave-like&#x27; and you can no longer measure x as well. That&#x27;s all there is to it.<p>It&#x27;s not exactly rigorous, but I don&#x27;t think this explanation is too misleading either (though I&#x27;d be happy to learn otherwise!).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_packet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_packet</a>",1419031296

The only difference was the name of the product and the price.<p>*EDITED:<p>Front: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/ZkcPiEY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/ZkcPiEY.jpg</a><p>Back:  <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/gOj5uYK.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/gOj5uYK.jpg</a>",1419030487

Learning that the uncertainty principle gives rise to phenomena that popular science calls &quot;wave-particle&quot; duality was taught to me in quantum 101.<p>From the abstract: &quot;This idea...upper bounds the sum of the interference visibility and the path distinguishability. Such wave-particle duality relations (WPDRs) are often thought to be conceptually inequivalent to Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, although this has been debated.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m quite surprised that anyone would think that those relationships wouldn&#x27;t be direct consequences of uncertainty. They are directly analogous to position and momenta quantities.<p>&quot;Here we show that WPDRs correspond precisely to a modern formulation of the uncertainty principle&quot;<p>No surprises here.",1419030445

It contains a few quite entertaining quotes, in particular:<p><pre><code>    > And since Bohm’s equations make exactly the same\n    > predictions as those of ordinary quantum mechanics,\n    > it is not clear what is accomplished by adding the\n    > complication of guiding waves, except to restore a\n    > sense of sanity to the whole affair.\n</code></pre>\nScott Aaronson has a brief introduction to Bohmian Mechanics at the end of his notes on decoherence and hidden variables [2]:<p><pre><code>    > Again, the amazing thing about this theory is that it&#x27;s\n    > deterministic: specify the &quot;actual&quot; positions of all the\n    > particles in the universe at any one time, and you&#x27;ve specified\n    > their &quot;actual&quot; positions at all earlier and later times.\n</code></pre>\nScott&#x27;s perspective is particularly interesting because he points out some limitations of Bohmian Mechanics. To paraphrase badly, the deterministic particle trajectories obtained from Bohmian Mechanics rely upon dealing with actual particles, position, momentum, in infinite dimensional spaces. It doesn&#x27;t give you deterministic behaviour in the finite dimensional spaces that computer scientists prefer.<p>Some proponents of Bohmian Mechanics point out that the theoretical predictions of deterministic particle trajectories for the famous double-slit experiment agree with recent experimental results.<p>Theoretical predictions: see Figure 1, page 14 of [3], which is an adaptation of a figure from [4].<p>Experimental results: see Figure 3, page 1171 of [5].<p>Note that [5] carefully frame their experimental results as &quot;Using weak measurements, however, it is possible to operationally define a set of trajectories for an ensemble of quantum particles&quot;.<p>For further reading, please see [6] for links to introductory writing about Bohmian Mechanics.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://inference-review.com/article/on-bohmian-mechanics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inference-review.com/article/on-bohmian-mechanics</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec11.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec11.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~bohmmech/BohmHome/files/Introduction.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~bohmmech/BohmHome/fil...</a><p>[4]: &quot;Quantum interference and the quantum potential&quot; -- Philippidis, Dewdney, Hiley -- Il Nuovo Cimento B, 1979; [paywalled article] -- <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02743566"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02743566</a><p>[5]: &quot;Observing the Average Trajectories of Single Photons in a Two-Slit Interferometer&quot; -- Kocsis, Braverman, Ravets, Stevens, Mirin, Shalm, Steinberg; Science, 2011 -- [PDF] <a href=""http://materias.df.uba.ar/labo5Aa2012c2/files/2012/10/Weak-measurement.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://materias.df.uba.ar/labo5Aa2012c2/files/2012/10/Weak-m...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net/whatisbm_introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net/whatisbm_introduction.html</a>",1419030313

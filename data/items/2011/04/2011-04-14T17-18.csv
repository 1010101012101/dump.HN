2447774,comment,2447258,2447258,15,0,lars,,,"Oz is a pretty damn cool language. But I think another thing that's hampering its adoption, apart from syntax, is the lack of available libraries.<p>I also have to add to the praise of Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming. I remember in particular an exercise from that book where you were asked to write a simple parser in a particular paradigm. It basically asked you to write the procedure parse(code, syntax_tree), where you'd give the code as the first parameter, and where syntax_tree was the output parameter. Once you had made that, the last sub-exercise said ""Oh BTW, try calling your function with an empty code parameter, and an existing syntax tree."" Lo and behold, it worked! My parser could run in reverse, and it spat out all strings that would produce the given syntax tree. This was a mind blowing experience at the time.",1302803982

It may be the case that it would choke anything but the most powerful modern desktops/laptops; they can afford to throw 32 cores at the problem for a fraction of a second where you can't, or it may be backing to an arbitrarily large pre-computed lookup table of some type stored in memory on these machines. I doubt it's that bad, I just made a number up, but it could be bad. And cell phones may not be able to do anything with it at all. Using a server gives them the freedom to use more power, automatically collect the results for more learning, and not need to worry about compatibility. (Or reverse engineering.)",1302803897

2447770,comment,2446790,2446790,8,0,baddox,,,"I like the writing style and simplicity of presentation. I would recommend putting some thought into the order and organization of the articles. Perhaps you should have ""main"" articles about data structures, then sub-articles about the algorithms that are relevant to them (e.g. ""binary search"" could be under ""arrays,"" ""heapsort"" and ""priority queue"" operations under ""heaps,"" etc.). Obviously, it's a challenge to choose the order and organization of topics and subtopicsit's essentially the task of developing a curriculum.<p>If you plan on doing some tree/graph algorithms, perhaps you could have a brief introduction to the topic by talking about trees and graphs in general, then proceeding by discussing heaps, simple binary trees (which can branch off into more advanced topics like the various balanced binary trees), and so forth.<p>As a side note, I think binary trees are a great visual way to introduce the concept of asymptotic running time in a more accessible/pragmatic (albeit less rigorous) way, by showing that the more balanced a binary tree is, the fewer steps it will take on average to find an element (approaching the best-case of log base 2 of <i>n</i>).

2447749,comment,2447496,2447672,13,0,tel,,,"I'm not familiar with Android, so I'm not sure about the capabilities of its client side speech recognition algorithms, but the short answer is that competent speech to text is currently a very, very intensive problem.<p>SR is roughly divided into acoustic and language modeling. The acoustic model proposes words that might have been said given some chunk of speech and the language model tells you what the most likely actual word is given what's been said.<p>The acoustic model can be solved in a large number of ways  though production technologies use very large hidden Markov models  but decoding a word sequence from speech might scale like O(knm^2) with n being the size of your vocabulary (often <i>large</i>), m the complexity of the acoustic model (# of phonemes modelled, perhaps) and k the number of acoustic frames. The n at the very least can be parallelized (embarrassingly), but the m and k cannot.<p>The language model involves a search through an exponential search space of orderings of words in the vocabulary (n^l choices, but l is also unknown). Anything sophisticated also will have an incredibly large (in memory) model as it has to have parameters across words, pairs of words, triples of words, grammatical categories, topics, etc. etc.<p>Solving both of these problems well simultaneously is not a task for a consumer computer. Speedy algorithms with small vocabularies and simple models exist and are implemented (Dragon Naturally Speaking, for instance) but Google didn't go and record a million hours of GOOG-411 to produce Dragon's technology over again.<p>---<p>Finally, there's a lot of work on front end signal processing in SR. Before you get into acoustic and language modeling, you often transform your input into another representation (often spectral components from sliding 10ms frames). A growing camp in SR research involves finding <i>sparse</i> front end representations of speech though. If the client-side software is capable of quickly computing a sparse representation of the speech, that could dramatically reduce the latency and bandwidth issues.",1302803505

I mean, perfect? Fluffy, nice balance of tasty fillings, not overdone? I have. Maybe twice. Each time, it was <i>wonderful</i>. Wonderful for the fact that with just five ingredients, it created subtle, delicious flavors and enjoyable textures. Wonderful for the discipline and focus necessary not to overcomplicate it with unneeded flourish.<p>It's so simple, compared to some of the more elaborate meals I've eaten. And that's what made it so special.<p>Another parallel is tools. Have you ever hefted a <i>really</i> nice kitchen knife? Maybe one of those numbers where the blade and the shank are forged from a single piece of metal? Everything just swoops and melts together, and the blade feels like a comfortable extension of your arm. Just the right weight, perfect leverage, a tool that was agonized over by a craftsman desperate to make the best.<p>Simple, relative to a Swiss Army knife? Absolutely. And that's where its power comes from.<p>iOS has some things about it that reward simplicity and focus. It's really easy to make an overwrought, complex app on any platform, and iOS is no exception. With a lot of care and attention to detail, though, you can make something that's simple, not distracting, made from the barest components necessary and extremely good at solving a very specific problem with minimum fuss.<p>When that happens, it's so nice to see.<p>*nix rewards people who build their own stuff, which is fine, but the tradeoff in this is craftsmanship. It's easy enough to get system tools to the level of ""good enough for you"" without ever reaching good enough for everyone. That, I suspect, is the cultural difference you've detected here.",1302803187

Good: comments I agree with.
Bad: comments I disagree with.
</joke><p>And if I left it there, I'd rate my own comment poorly (#2, below). So, now I'll try to be serious:<p>1. Comments I consider to be high value tend to reference external sources (other websites or authorities), which tends to create a minimal sort of empirical grounding. External links that add information to a topic are valuable. I.e., new information usually == good.<p>2. One liners, quips, etc... tend to be low value.<p>3. Many other values are subjective. Clear, punchy writing adds value, as does insightful analysis, but what counts as ""clear"" or ""insightful"" varies by the reader.<p>4. I personally have a bias towards ideas that are new to me; at least then, I feel I've learned something. But again, new != good, necessarily.<p>5. IMHO, the worst sorts of comments cluster in the most controversial sorts of threads. E.g., anything political or mired in non empirical sorts of value judgments[1]. See PG's essay ""Keep Your Identity Small"": <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</a>. If I were to wager, I'd bet that the reason comment quality has been perceived to decline is mostly a function of the increased number of such threads.<p>[1] I personally find these interesting, because I enjoy debating philosophy & politics.

9 out of 10 startups fail. So even if you do drop out and start your own company, you are not likely to succeed the first or even second and third time round. But you will LEARN A LOT! You will learn a lot of things that uni would not teach you. That said, you can learn this whenever you start your company - at age 16 or age 22, or 33 in my case.

Scientific and technological advancements help everyone (at least potentially) because you don't have to divvy up knowledge. Even better the rate of scientific advancement tends to increase with a larger existing knowledge base. Ultimately more population means (much) more advancement.

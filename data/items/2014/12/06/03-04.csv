8708292,comment,8705019,8705019,0,0,cdoxsey,,,"In 1977 Jim Fixx published the best-selling book &quot;The Complete Book of Running&quot; which popularized running for sport, and purported to demonstrate its health benefits - including increased longevity.<p>7 years later he died of a heart attack while jogging at the age of 52.<p>His death doesn&#x27;t mean running is a bad idea - a single anecdote is statistically insignificant - but perhaps it can remind us that nothing we do can guarantee a long and healthy life.<p>All too often we take a mildly correlated statistic, give it a hand-wavy air of &quot;science&quot;, and then pronounce it as a set-in-stone moral absolute. How much of the received wisdom about healthy lifestyles that you were taught has been shown to be completely wrong? I don&#x27;t doubt that in 3 years there will be another New York times article, demonstrating why running is actually terrible for you, and you should never do it no matter what age you are.<p>Growing up in a secular society ancient religions can seem awful strange: why did people worship stone statues and sacrifice to them? Did they really believe all that effort did anything?<p>But perhaps our modern obsession with &quot;healthiness&quot; reflects the same underlying human motivation: incapable of accepting the reality of our own deaths we grasp at anything to try and give ourselves the illusion of control. Is eating an organic strawberry in the hopes of living longer really any different than performing a ritualistic dance in the hopes of bringing rain?",1417838123

8708262,comment,8704318,8706712,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"g++&#x27;s sizeof(std::string) is only 8 bytes because it&#x27;s a single pointer such that the struct can be reinterpret_casted to a const char * and you get the same thing that c_str() gives you.  It&#x27;s reference-counted (across threads!), copy-on-write.  I don&#x27;t think people would mind a 24-byte std::string (on 64-bit systems), which would consist of a pointer, size, and capacity, and which would allow 22-byte strings to be stored inline.<p>On Windows, sizeof(std::string) is 24 or 32 depending on 32- or 64-bit.  sizeof(vector<char>) is 12 and 24, respectively, of course.  I believe the extra size of the std::string is for storing strings inline.  I&#x27;d guess their implementation looks like struct { char *ptr; size_t size; union { size_t capacity; char buf[16]; } u; };, which sacrifices some size in favor of keeping the code paths simple.",1417837138

8708252,comment,8707583,8708087,0,0,davidbalbert,,,"One thing I think we could have done better with Code Words is added short bios. Bios add context, which is lacking here. Here&#x27;s R0ml&#x27;s bio from 2006[^1]:<p><i>r0ml is an software architect and systems designer with over thirty years of experience. For two decades, r0ml worked on Wall Street, developing market data, trading, risk management, and quantitative analysis systems. More recently, as chief technical architect at AT&T Wireless, he drove the improvement of their CRM, ERP, commission, and data warehousing systems. Over the last several years, r0ml has become increasingly interested in open source software strategy at large enterprises, and is a frequent speaker on the topic.</i><p>This is the same R0ml that thaumaturgy mentions in a sibling comment.<p>I&#x27;ve been lucky to meet a lot of very smart programmers over the past 3.5 years working at Hacker School, and R0ml is one of the people I respect the most. He has a lot of opinions about programming, many of them contrarian. I think this comes from his background. His career began in the &#x27;70s. He spent the first third of it working in APL, the next third in Smalltalk, and the most recent third in Java. Over the year or so that I&#x27;ve known R0ml, he&#x27;s planted the seeds of a number of unconventional ideas in my head (program in the database, don&#x27;t use libraries, write things from scratch, the expressive power of a language is partially derived from what&#x27;s in its standard library). I&#x27;m sure these aren&#x27;t all good ideasâ€”maybe some of them are terribleâ€”but they&#x27;ve profoundly affected the way I go about my programming. R0ml is on the short list of people I would want to work for if I was not running Hacker School.<p>I don&#x27;t bring this all up to refute your opinionsâ€“R0ml may be wrong in this case or even in all casesâ€“I mostly wanted to give some context explaining why the tone of your response made me sad and frustrated. The onus is on us to give readers context for what they&#x27;re reading, and I don&#x27;t think we did a great job of that, but if you&#x27;re going to write such a mean spirited response, I think some of the onus is on you to do some research before accusing someone of being a novice and responding in a way that feels at least partially ad hominem.<p>Around a month ago, I read <i>Programming with Managed Time</i>[^2], the paper that you wrote with Jonathan Edwards for Onward! &#x27;14. I thought it was insightful, well written, and contrarian in the best of ways. The first things I thought when I finished it was &quot;I bet R0ml would enjoy that.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t mean to compare Code Words to an academic journal (it&#x27;s absolutely not), nor do I mean to compare R0ml&#x27;s article to your paper in terms of scope, research, or time put into it (yours obviously took more time and has much greater insight than R0ml&#x27;s short article). I&#x27;m just bummed that one person who&#x27;s counterintuitive opinions and experience I respect would be so quick to dismiss the opinions of someone else who I respect for the same reasons.<p>I know that complaining about tone is often used to distract from more substantive issues, but I&#x27;m going to risk doing that anyway: Please be nice!<p>Thanks.<p>[^1]: <a href=""http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_spkr/1551"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_spkr/1551</a><p>[^2]: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/211297/onward14.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/211297/onward14.pdf</a>",1417836901

Nice! Still, I can&#x27;t imagine the thought process that leads to express links in JSON as `[&quot;/foo:/bar/foo&quot;,&quot;/baz:/bar/baz&quot;]` rather than `{&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;baz&quot;:&quot;baz&quot;}` (or even `{&quot;/bar/foo&quot;:&quot;/foo&quot;,&quot;/bar/baz&quot;:&quot;/baz&quot;}` if you&#x27;re attached to the weird hierarchical names). I similarly cannot imagine reasoning that leads to providing port number in JSON as a string, with prefix.<p>>> Is it still Docker&#x27;s official position that CLI is only official interface, and using HTTP API is frowned upon?\n> That was never true. I&#x27;m not sure how you got that idea.<p>Cannot find it now: it&#x27;s not easy to google out (and if it was in the docs, I&#x27;d need to go through web.archive.org), and I didn&#x27;t think about archiving it myself for later use. I think this was either in (possibly earlier version of) docs, or in some GitHub issue. The sentiment seems to stand, though: Docker&#x27;s own code base doesn&#x27;t even include any usable API client, and many seemingly basic CLI operations are very convoluted in API (how do I `docker run` with API? Is it still split across at least two separate calls?). Some of these problems are echoed in <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7358"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7358</a><p>Some (possibly most of all - I certainly hope so!) are solved, but the API docs were good at listing the endpoints and (some of) the parameters [I recall JSON format was incompletely described, or not kept up to date]. There was virtually no pragmatic docs on how to use the API to achieve equivalent of, say, a `docker run` invocation. And while I obviously can open an issue or fix it in a PR, reflecting problems back at community <i>because it&#x27;s open source, if it bothers you, go fix it yourself</i> doesn&#x27;t seem a proper approach. In particular, if the problem is about keeping documentation in sync with code (format of JSON described in API docs did at some point diverge from actual behaviour; if you want me to go through the docs right now and verify each piece, I&#x27;d be happy to do that, but let&#x27;s discuss the consulting contract first), it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect your users to pinpoint the issue by going through Git changelogs.<p>> You can use all these things [HTTP Auth] with the registry API.<p>Can I `docker pull` an image that is behind plain http auth (e.g. at a registry proxied to <a href=""https://foo:bar@example.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foo:bar@example.com/</a>)? How do I specify that? Last time I tried to figure this out (before 1.2.0, after 1.0.0, so it may have changed), this was either not possible, or completely undocumented.<p>And while we&#x27;re at it, what would exactly be the problem with letting me pull an image available at <a href=""https://foo.bar@example.com/path/to/image.tar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foo.bar@example.com/path/to/image.tar</a>? Why there even is a separate registry API rather than plain HTTP? This part still eludes me.<p>Re tcp://â€¦ vs <a href=""http://â€¦"" rel=""nofollow"">http://â€¦</a> it&#x27;s obviously functionally equivalent and cosmetic, unless you want to write some plumbing and you have to add logic to translate from the tcp:// format (which doesn&#x27;t seem to have any actual reason to be written this way) to <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> URL and back. Similar thing with `tcp://` prefix for ports forwarded from linked containers: I either have to use the long form that includes the original port number, or parse out the irrelevant `tcp://` piece (yes, I know there could be udp:// [but why the double slash? is there any URI path that could follow?]; the protocol is usually obvious from the context, and need to parse out the irrelevant text is actual overhead).<p>So, for Docker&#x27;s convenience (or because of a bit of thoughtlessness when something was first implemented), there&#x27;s a small but significant overhead incurred on a lot of current and future pieces of plumbing and containers, because for some reason (was there any?) you decided `tcp://` looks better than `<a href=""http://`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://`</a> for an HTTP URL, and `tcp://1.2.3.4:567` looks prettier than just `1.2.3.4:567`.",1417835529

Then, this information could be cached, as long as the public key stayed the same.

Microsoft is about the enterprise.<p>I think many criticize Microsoft from a consumer standpoint, but the CEO of Microsoft is going to know where his bread is buttered.<p>If any of us was the CEO we'd realize that we couldn't make the kind of radical changes we crave as consumers.<p>Changing course will take them some time, but I believe we'll see MSX eventually (in some horrible form).<p>In the meantime I'll keep using Mac/open source at home and (barely) tolerating MS software at work.",1209728453

Last time Pav mentioned it, he had written over 500 articles, so now he prob has 700+.  His most successful articles are posted on the front, circulate around the internet, etc.  But if you go back sequentially through his archives, maybe only 1/3 of them are good and 1/10 are great.  But those stand out in memory of the ""good old Steve Pavlina"".  Same for pg, raganwald, and Joel.",1209728012

179375,comment,179259,179259,0,0,ericb,,,"I'd make virtualization go straight to the core. Then I'd extend the virtualization into smaller and smaller places until you can run indivual apps/windows in micro VM's without ""feeling it."" I'd also work on making the VM's interoperate securely via a bridge to allow seamless copy/paste and networking and remove the feeling of being different VM's. So long as the bridge is secure, the OS itself will be more secure. I would open source the bridge code.<p>Now the problem of legacy compatibility can be contained to VM's with support for the previous gen and the latest kernel can be free to update itself.<p>I'd clean up security and put out some smaller security X-prizes to make reporting exploits more profitable than selling them elsewhere.",1209727404
179374,comment,179338,179338,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"From TFA: ""What is Xobni OTHER THAN a feature of Outlook?""<p>The core problem with this commentary is that the writer doesn't understand that Xobni can be more than just an Outlook feature.  I think he has a hard time seeing beyond the UI that's been presented.<p>I am reminded of VitalSigns that many people saw is just a toy for looking at how well your dial up connection was working.  Others realized that the underlying technology was interesting, that it applied in the business environment and VitalSigns was bought out for a good price.",1209727307

When I wake up after that (early morning), I feel absolutely <i>fantastic</i>.<p>The end result is probably only about 20-25 hours work in two days - i.e. not much more than normal working days.

Depending upon the country/state/region, you may have some rights afforded to you if you create (and document as such) any inventions outside of the workplace without using any company trade secrets or technology, so long as your invention does not relate to the current or demonstrably anticipated R&D of the company.<p>Many companies have these types of clauses in their employment contracts for defensive purposes to protect the company against copyright claims from its employees.

It&#x27;s not dissimilar to a Simpsons episode on Hulu &quot;presented by Dove.&quot; It can be done really well, with clear separation, and the positive association happens when a reader associates quality content with a sponsor. Publishers know what&#x27;s at stake and I think they are learning this balance.<p>EDIT: Actually I thought about it some more. Maybe native advertising only works for entertainment content.

As someone else in this discussion mentioned a simple language doesn&#x27;t mean that solutions in this language are simple! Look at what real problems you have to solve in you applications, and then tell me that generics in a statically typed language are not important! Go applications are full of useless code to circumvent this restriction. Want to make something immutable? Not very convenient in Go, very easy in most other (statically typed) languages.<p>While Scala has a complex type system it is a simple language at it&#x27;s heart. For example try-catch is not a special language feature but another application of the powerful pattern matching. It will take a little longer to learn Scala compared to Java, but you get a much better tool to solve the most problems. And you get all the libraries and the tools (any Go IDE on the level of IntelliJ or NetBeans?) of the big Java ecosystem.<p>But even if you don&#x27;t want to use Scala, you could be more productive with Java than with Go.

But I think most people also don&#x27;t want to make enhancements that only work on a single emulator. And getting emulator authors to cooperate is like herding cats (which is why we are still using the woefully inadequate iNES header format in 2014.) So I could have made MSU1 run some 1080p video mode with a 2GHz simulated x86 processor, but it was important to me that the protocol be as simple as possible and exist in a physical implementation that worked on the real system.<p>More along the lines of your example, my emulator core is completely abstracted to its own library and is GPL, so it would be quite easy to hook routines as you have to do things like hires textures even on the SNES. But there are some more extreme challenges to that than just identifying key functions, as the SNES renderer is <i>very</i> elaborate.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve specifically <i>enhanced</i> PC games, but I&#x27;ve definitely worked on translations of them from Japanese to English. There&#x27;s definitely lots of fun tricks you can do outside of emulation, still. I usually write a debug process launcher that uses DLL injection, which is then followed by installing trampolines in various functions.<p>We worked on a game called Heroine Anthem, where the movie file format was entirely custom. So we ripped the movie with screen capture software, subtitled it, encoded it to XviD (this was a while ago), and then ran our own DirectShow window to play back the movie in place of the originals.<p>We also patched an online multiplayer game, Fuurai no Shiren, to add a new dialog to configure the server you connect to. We reverse engineered their protocol (their &quot;encryption&quot; was a strtr function on streams of hex values. Quite laughable.) and then created our own PHP server, called OpenShiren, so that people could run their own instances. Especially useful once Chunsoft shut their servers down.<p>I&#x27;ve done far, far crazier things with manipulating others&#x27; applications, but since they weren&#x27;t games, I won&#x27;t elaborate on those here.",1408051811

Fascinated because it really is inherently interesting, and repulsed because I&#x27;m not at all certain that torturing monkeys through isolation and/or maternal deprivation and then killing them is really advancing the state of 5-HTTPLPR research far beyond what is already being done with studies that don&#x27;t involve the psychiatric destruction of presocial primates. (PubMed shows 75 animal-based 5-HTTLPR/rh5-HTTLPR studies, and 1221 human-based studies.) There are some truly thorny questions here -- and I&#x27;m a <i>proponent</i> of animal studies in many cases -- that I feel researchers, particularly those involved in psychiatric animal models, are hand-waving away.<p>[1] Fellow UW-Madison researcher A.

In fact, Seagate Technology was not felled by disruption. Between 1989 and 1990, its sales doubled, reaching $2.4 billion, “more than all of its U.S. competitors combined,” according to an industry report. In 1997, the year Christensen published “The Innovator’s Dilemma,”<p>Seagate was the largest company in the disk-drive industry, reporting revenues of nine billion dollars. Last year, Seagate shipped its two-billionth disk drive. Most of the entrant firms celebrated by Christensen as triumphant disrupters, on the other hand, no longer exist, their success having been in some cases brief and in others illusory.

But D-D is harder to ignite than D-3He.<p>This would hardly be aneutronic (you&#x27;d have one neutron per two nuclear collisions, instead of roughly per 100 with exogenous 3He), but it does provide a way of making 3He.

This has the same high cross-section and low propensity to create dangerous radionuclides as B4C, but is expensive and toxic. It is, however, much easier to make things out of, because it is just a metal. Older projects use tungsten, which <i>does</i> create dangerous radionuclides (181W and 185W). I was mostly aware of research re: B4C, but had been ignorant of beryllium.<p>So I should have said &quot;modern fusion reactors generally use first-wall materials like boron carbide and beryllium, which do not become radioactive when irradiated&quot;. In practice, it&#x27;s not worth holding up experiments on containment to make safe walls (ITER isn&#x27;t built to last).

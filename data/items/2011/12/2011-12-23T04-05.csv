But you're thinking as a <i>producer</i> of content here.<p>As a <i>consumer</i> of content, I can't hold myself to the standard of only reading things written by ""people who have distinguished themselves at writing."" If you're the only person who has written about X, and I'm researching X, I'm going to have to look at your article—at least to tell if I can safely <i>not</i> look at your article without having missed something important.<p>And good writing is <i>hard</i>: you're basically giving the creative equivalent to the obligatory advice of ""eat less and exercise more."" Yes, reworking and redrafting to achieve flow in your writing is a ""good thing."" It's something to strive for. But that doesn't mean that you can expect anyone to <i>follow</i> that advice just because they read a few paragraphs about it online. If they write much, they've likely already given it some thought—and it's a <i>lack of willpower</i>, not a lack of skill, that prevents them from editing their work as much as is necessary to get a result easily consumable by others.<p>An explicit ""executive summary"" line is a <i>quick fix</i>. It's something an amateur writer—one who doesn't practice writing as a craft, and has no desire to redraft—can use to make their writing less painful. It's asking much less of people—it's just a sentence, written after the fact, explaining what you just said—so it's probably something people <i>would</i> implement after seeing a conversation about it online and saying ""oh, that could work.""<p>Certainly, it's not as readable as <i>good writing</i>. But, for most people, it <i>is</i> more readable than whatever they had before, at much less cost.<p>(Also, I wouldn't mind if experienced writers included a call-out of some sort as well—not because it helps their prose <i>at all</i>, but rather just because I don't <i>know</i> if someone is an experienced writer until I actually dive into the body text, and by then I've already made my decision whether to read or not. <i>Give me metadata.</i>)",1324616156

One of the outcomes of the theory was then first observationally confirmed by Eddington's observations of an eclipse in 1919.<p>Up until 1919 Einstein and other's put much faith in the theory by using it to model reality without knowing if it's predictions would be observed without falsification.<p>I'm all for Popperian falsification as the modus of formal scientific advance but on an individual level it appears to me that those who work for many years on unconfirmed theories are often believing in the truth of those theories without empirical confirmation.<p>>""<i>Even if you believe it before you run an experiment on it, you do so provisionally, without putting ""faith"" in it, because you know you might be forced to discard it.</i>""<p>Moreover, it strikes me that one could not put faith in anything (the love of your mother say) if it were prevented by the possibility that later evidence would force you to discard it.

No one developer necessarily knows the full set of symbols defined in the top scope while they are writing an individual procedure.<p>And thus the problem: a developer thinks they've chosen a ""different (better) name"" for a some variable, but in fact they've chosen one that a different developer <i>also</i> thought was a ""different (better) name"", only one of them is in a lexically enclosing scope. This problem isn't likely to occur on the level of nested procedures or nested blocks, because the definitions would be visually close. But it's much more likely to happen when one of the symbols is defined in the top scope. Here, the definition could be many hundreds or thousands of lines away. It may even be in a separate commit, waiting to be merged, such that there's no way for either developer to know without closely reviewing every change.<p>And this is the criticism: the failure mode for this inadvertent reuse of a variable name is subtle bugs, as what one developer thought was a global symbol turns out to be modified and acquire strange values through unexpected codeflow, almost like the VM was corrupted and memory was behaving unreliably.<p>The qualitative difference of the top scope in situations like this is the reason why I suggested sigils or somesuch to disambiguate those scenarios. Perhaps top-level symbols can't be reassigned from nested scopes unless you use '$' as a prefix to their name; a visual shorthand that you are definitely not creating a new local symbol.<p>The reason I summarized your argument in the way I did is because your argument against this failure mode seems to be ""don't create top scopes with lots of symbols"". That's a fine argument (or rather, exhortation), but it isn't a realistic one. If the language is problematic with lots of symbols in the top scope, it should be unpleasant to use with lots of symbols in the top scope. And the unpleasantness shouldn't come from subtle bugs (the passive aggressiveness I mentioned); it should come from awkward and ugly sigils, or some other intrinsic way of discouraging those styles.",1324614464

3384601,comment,3382927,3384572,19,0,dangrossman,,,"> (Random, honest question)... is this acceptable?<p>That's how it works everywhere. It's written into any merchant account agreement with any payment provider. If your average ticket size, average monthly volume, or the business you're in changes, you have to notify them and get approval because it changes your risk profile. Because Visa and MasterCard mandate a <1% average chargeback rate from their members, that carries through to every level of payment processing service to make risk management a core piece of the business.<p>3rd party processors make it easy to sell an item or two on eBay without having to fill out pages of work history and references as you'd have to in order to accept credit cards directly... because there's very little risk. If you scam someone out of $100 and they charge it back, that $100 is going to be too small a portion of the processor's business to impact their rate.<p>But if the next month you sell $100k of product, and they don't even know who you are or what you're selling, it's time to pull back and ask you who you are. PayPal will do this. Amazon Payments will do this. Google Checkout will do this. 2Checkout will do this. Heck, 2Checkout will also call a random sampling of your customers to make sure you're actually selling what you say you're selling.<p>So in exchange for not having to fill out a 6 page application up front and tie yourself to a contract with monthly fees, PayPal and every other 3rd party processor will suspend your account for a business day or two to get the information from you only when it becomes necessary, then set you back on your way to continue doing business.<p>Most people never think about things like chargeback rates and risk to the processor, so when their account gets suspended, they freak out and spam a blog post assuming someone's trying to steal their money. A few days later they always have to follow up that everything's actually OK... there's no conspiracy to lock accounts and earn interest on the balance (reserve funds are held in non-interest-bearing accounts), they really just want to make sure you're not something so risky it's going to hurt their average chargeback rate.",1324614004

They know that modern technology makes this asset increasingly hard to control, and that unlike in the vinyl, 8-track, cassette, and early CD eras, they can longer create artificial scarcity as they once did.<p>They know that if that threat continues to grow as it does, they can't provide distribution as an asset to artists, which used to be a big reason you signed with a major label. That means they have to scale their operations back in a big way, which means letting a lot of people go and less profit (CDs sales actually are still a profitable business). Since they firmly believe in the protections copyright affords, and they've worked in this industry a long time, they see the better approach to be attacking the copyright infringement. And their job is to keep their company running the best they can. <i>Now</i> is it so surprising they consider the second option?<p>They may or may not understand that SOPA endangers many aspects of how the internet works. But they aren't <i>necessarily</i> acting in bad faith just because they support SOPA.<p>I know the niche hacker news fills is particularly well-targeted by SOPA, and that can lead to a circlejerk like any other online community with common beliefs, but it's harmful to discourse to assume those who you disagree with you on SOPA are inherently evil as a result.

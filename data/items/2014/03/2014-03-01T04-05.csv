Your job is to build high quality software using the tools given to you. If you are good at your job, and you are able to be a convincing salesman, you can often build software using the tools _you_ want (this has never been an issue for me anyways), but it is not going to be given to you on a silver platter.<p>It sounds to me like you are convinced that Node is the one and only way to build the software you work on (I think that&#x27;s bullshit frankly), and you won&#x27;t accept any alternatives. Well, you are about to find out the hard way what happens when you aren&#x27;t willing to work past your own pride.",1393649982

From the lede:<p>&quot;The self-described conservative think tank was pushing a shareholder proposal that would have required Apple to disclose the costs of its sustainability programs and to be more transparent about its participation in &quot;certain trade associations and business organizations promoting the amorphous concept of environmental sustainability.&quot;&quot;<p>What is so wrong with that request?  Forget your opinions and mine, as well as of the think tank.  Asking Apple to disclose what it is spending, and where, is a reasonable request.  And even if you&#x27;re a firm believer in the dangers of anthropogenic global warming, you must understand that not all of the organizations doing research or providing information about it are entirely reputable.

7323155,comment,7323075,7323075,30,0,cromwellian,,,"Heard the same arguments when Musk tried to get into rockets. He has no experience making rockets.<p>Then there was the naysaying when Apple was first getting into phones. What does Apple know about phones? How can they possibly compete with the likes of Nokia?<p>Often industries are disrupted by newcomers who aren&#x27;t constrained by the thinking of the existing players. Yes, Musk can&#x27;t violate the laws of physics or economics. But the cost structures of existing players aren&#x27;t always dictated by the fundamentals, but also by their own organizational baggage and structure. Hence, SpaceX can compete effectively with DoD defense contractors hooked on hugely inefficient government contracts. Is it that Boeing or Lockheed can&#x27;t things as cheaply, or that SpaceX quality has to suffer? Maybe the way the government dictates things get funded and manufactured leads to inefficiencies, like spreading things around congressional districts.<p>Likewise, for other car companies, the Big Three in particular, they are somewhat constrained by their existing investments, existing unions, and just plain old conservativism and aversion to risk taking.<p>So maybe Musk will fail utterly. No pain, no gain I say. He also has a chance of succeeding spectacularly.",1393649822
7323154,comment,7314706,7319417,3,0,detrino,,,"Nice result :)<p>Btw, it&#x27;s tempting to use std::function in the same way as you would use a function in Haskell, but it usually isn&#x27;t a very good idea. In C++ std::function is for when you want type erasure, usually because you wish to store a functor somewhere with a uniform type. Type erasure in C++ is similar to existential typing + a type class in Haskell. You could say that all Haskell closures are implicitly using type erasure and then the compiler has to work hard to optimize away the extra boxing/indirect calls.<p>Here is another way to write map in C++:<p><pre><code>    #include <iostream>\n    #include <list>\n\n    template<typename F, typename A, typename B = typename std::result_of<F(A)>::type>\n    std::list<B> map(std::list<A> const & xs, F f)\n    {\n        std::list<B> ys;\n        for (auto const & x : xs) ys.push_back(f(x));\n        return ys;\n    }\n\n    int main()\n    {\n        std::list<int> xs{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n        auto ys = map(xs, [](int i) { return i * 2; });\n        for (auto y : ys) std::cout << y << &quot;\\n&quot;;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nYou can expect this code to run exactly as fast as if you had written the loop by hand instead of using the map template function.",1393649785
7323153,comment,7285295,7289834,1,0,smsm42,,,"(1) We&#x27;ve heard this song since invention of the steam engine. Yes, dozens of horse-based and carriage-based professions disappeared due to shifts in technology. Yes, US whaling industry, once fifth largest in the economy, is no more. Yes, water-bearers, ice- and kerosene-sellers are not that common anymore, since running water, refrigeration and electric light became commonplace. But somehow there are hundreds of other professions and occupations, unheard of in the age of horse and carriage, that were created instead. There is always something to do. And always will be.<p>(2) Yes, of course, people will start giving away their possessions really soon now. As soon as there will be communism, which is right around the corner. I&#x27;ll believe it when somebody gifts me a yacht and a beachfront house somewhere in Mediterranean. BTW, how exactly you would have your magic robots make everybody their own beachfront house in the Mediterranean?<p>(3) Yeah right. We just need a set of magic technologies which would do something that was never done and nobody has any remotest idea how to do it, and every attempt in the past to do it ended up in spectacular and very bloody disaster. Technology is not magic, it can do a lot but it can not change human nature and it can not produce everything out of nothing for free.<p>(4) Businesses are people. You&#x27;re just trying to dehumanize them because these people stand in line of your agenda. While you are glad to describe how people would gift you their possessions and work for you for free, you still realize fat chance they will. So you just say - well, those not true people, those are &quot;elites&quot; and &quot;businesses&quot; and &quot;special interests&quot; (as if anybody but people can have interests!) and as soon as we disenfranchise them and take power to the real people - abundance and happiness will ensue.

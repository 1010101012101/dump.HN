Across the board there have been incredible advances in chemistry, physics, quantum physics (which allows us our tiny powerful processors in things like cellphones and laptops and tablets), commercial aerospace, normal aerospace (jet-set lifestyle was a term for rich in the 60s because you could afford to fly, now EVERYONE flies, we just haven't increased the speed for a bunch of well laid out elsewhere reasons[1]).  Also, we're on the verge of self driving cars. Further it misunderstands progress in general. It seems to think progress in all fields must be linear so big advancements in new fields of days of yore should still be advancing at such rates today ignoring rapidly growing complexity as the field matures. Computers, the newest field, has advanced the most recently because it is still relatively new.<p>This kind of thinking is just wrong and somewhat old fashioned. Just because we didn't get the future that star trek and pulp 60's sci-fi promised us doesn't mean we collectively screwed up somehow. The refrain ""where's my flying car"" or ""where's my jetpack"" is just misguided. We are living in the future, just not one predicted. Transportation speeds stopped increasing rapidly and went from exponential back to linear to nearly stalled, but as mentioned they scaled from a few rich to all. And there are good reasons for this, not cowardice etc. Meanwhile unexpectedly computation and communication technology exploded. I can video chat with everyone I know anywhere in the world for effectively free.  I carry around a better than star trek communicator.<p>This is old man thinking, stuck in one view of how the world was going to be and ignoring how the world is. It's ignorant and offensive and misguided.

These modes of thinking not only make each culture/country/peoples unique, it actually facilitates various strengths.<p>Primarily, the Chinese language actually allows humans to remember and store more information in short term memory when compared to more Western/romantic languages. Most humans can store 7 (+- 2) bits of information (bits being defined as one contextual idea: 25 + 23 are 3 bits, Picasso's Mona Lisa is 1 bit).<p>The Chinese language actually facilitates math/short-term memory because many things are spoken/read/written as one contextual idea. When remembering a large number (602-112-5097 for example), English speakers tend to remember this number as:\nArea code = 1 contextual bits\nEach individual number = 7 contextual bits\nThis happens because the English language separates non-related digits into individual ideas.<p>In Chinese however, masses of digits are written and spoken as one long contextual idea. Similarly, in memory, these long numbers are more easily stored as one contextual bit and take up ""less"" space.<p>Conversely, English (and to some degree romantic languages) happen to have lots of descriptors (what we call adjectives and adverbs). This, respectively, is one of the reasons why English speakers tend to be more creative with how they express themselves.<p>Does this mean that we'll eventually tend towards an universal language that implements all the good points of current languages? Perhaps.<p>Personally, I enjoy the uniqueness of each language by itself.",1352417671

My mom's siblings include a couple of doctors, a military officer, a business executive, etc. My mom was herself a journalist, and of her sons I'm a lawyer and my brother is a banker. This is not a coincidence.

They were prevented from voting, they were prevented from going to school, they were prevented from holding anything more than menial jobs. At the time my grandfather was building a social inheritance to pass down to his children and grandchildren and great grandchildren, blacks were being attacked with firehoses by the government for daring to fight for the barest of equal rights.<p>My grandfather has been dead for more than 20 years, but his legacy is going to reach out to at least another generation. When my little girl asks why she should do her homework, I will tell her about her great grandfather, her grand uncles and aunts, and how she should study hard so she can be a doctor like them. So too does the legacy of institutional discrimination reach out over the generations.<p>A poor white person and a poor black person (assuming they can trace their history back to the slaves) are not in the same boat. One is in his plight because of the vagracies of the economy, the luck of the draw, etc. For the other, at least part of his socioeconomic situation, some identifiable component, can be traced back to the systematic discrimination and oppression suffered by his ancestors at the hands of the still-extant state and federal governments.<p>So no, just basing efforts on socioeconomics generally is not enough.

4760435,comment,4760024,4760024,1,0,xvolter,,,"It is highly unlikely Apple will merge the two OSes within the next foreseeable future. Give it 10 to 20 years and that may happen, but even then, so many things would have changed everything you know now will be considered dated - just like creating shell scripts in Perl is considered dated.<p>The problem is the two operating systems are designed for different purposes, extremely different purposes. One is designed for mobile devices, to receive primarily touch driven events, and works off an extremely small hardware base. OS X, Apple's laptop and desktop operating system, is designed for many more, much more intensive things - relying a lot more on things you would not find on a mobile device, such as file management, users, permissions, terminals, third-party installable applications, process management, and all the things that come with Apple's graphics engines that so many people seem to like.<p>Overall, the chance to create new desktop software that will survive the test of time is limited. Within the next few years it's far more likely you will see intensive desktop applications go to simpler and easier to use web applications. Starting a new desktop app currently may prove to be a waste of time, depending on what it is.<p>Mobile apps will be around easily for the next 5 to 15 years, as the general population will still be growing the percentage of people who have smartphones, who use mobile apps, and therefore the demand for new mobile apps will increase.<p>Personally, if I had the choice, I'd work on mobile apps more. I myself do a lot of Android development, trying to avoid developing specifically for iOS devices. You may consider learning Android SDK to grow your horizons, or even the new BlackBerry one - which I read somewhere is offering a guaranteed $10,000 for any Blackberry-specific new app created for the first year. Obviously 10k in one year isn't talking about a huge jackpot, but that may get you interested to know that at MINIMUM you will earn 10k from Blackberry's application marketplace next year.<p>However, at the same time, I work with web applications more than I do mobile applications, and the only growing demand I see for desktop applications are in integrating web services more deeply with an operating system and video games (which honestly, never stops growing the demand for). So if your desktop app is one of those, go with with that hands down.<p>If you're looking at taking on a paying job developing a desktop application for Mac OS X versus working for yourself on your own mobile applications - work for yourself as long as you can. Trust me, I used to have a few semi-popular Android apps, made enough to keep a stable lively hood, then took a job to get a little extra money, within about two months of not having the time to commit my mobile apps dropped, I went from a peak of 15k a month to now roughly 800 a month in mobile app income - which removes my option of working for myself until I stabilize that again. It is incredibly difficult to do so however, when balancing a full time job and having the desire to work for yourself again. I now know never to make that mistake again. Career wise I would have been far happier earning a little less but working for myself, on my own schedule, than ever working a 9-5 job.",1352416778

Since Hipmunk's inception though, it has definitely been the 'go-to' place for travel-planning, and beats the nearest competition (that I've used) by a mile.<p>I would also venture to say that this was perhaps a timely exit for Kayak, as the more and more traction Hipmunk sees, the less off the Kayak founders would have been for an exit.",1352415886

Lately though, it's people who say ""my computer is slow, I have to delete some icons from my desktop"". That, for some reason, just drives me crazy.<p>Ah since we are doing this, I have to share a story.\nI worked as IT support for a university while I was an undergrad. I had a professor call me demanding that I recall an email that he sent to all of his students (outside of the university email system) because he sent out social security numbers by accident. When I told him that wasn't possible, he flipped out on me, because it was my fault. There is no reasonable response with the exception of laughing...which is what I did after he hung up on me.<p>I had to share that as my support days flashed before my eyes reading this thread.",1352415848

While a fuss doesn't always produce change, it seems to me that change following a fuss may reasonably be viewed as a response.<p>Better analogy: Asking me for five dollars will not consistently result in me giving you five dollars. But if you ask for five dollars and I give it, you would not be wrong to assume that the two events are related. There are other conceivable explanations (e.g. perhaps I wasn't listening to you, but mistook you for a valet), but those are so much less likely given the context that it's quite reasonable to assume I was responding to your request.",1352415726

Revnums are perfectly adequate for the many situations in which frequent coordination with a central repository is completely feasible.<p>Git also does not require every file and subdirectory to be modified by every merge, so based on that criterion it's no more astonishing that SVN merge tracking can work than it is that Git merge tracking can work.<p>SVN's merge tracking was an after-thought, and it was implemented using the general, user-visible, metadata facility (properties). So historically svn was prone to problems such as repeated merging, and today it's possible to make things complicated, and then manually edit and botch the complex merge history, and suffer.<p>Fundamentally, svn:mergeinfo summarizes history rather than pointing only to merge-parents. I suppose the latter is what you mean when you speak of clear-thinking primitives. I wasn't involved in the mergeinfo design, but it seems less likely the result of muddled thinking than of a design decision recognizing that the entire revision graph isn't locally available to svn users and that the summary is sufficient under reasonable restrictions on usage.<p>Your condemnation of svn as a ""hopelessly hamstrung"" ""dead-end"" seems derived more from your dismissal of centralized version control generally than from the particular details of svn's design or implementation. In that dismissal I think you're taking too narrow a view of the ways in which people work together.",1270256319

1237929,story,,,5,4,dualogy,"Ask HN: any white-label/SaaS virtual-currency/""MyPoints"" services out there?",,"Example: MailChimp has some sort of ""credit"" system and many major sites are rolling their own.<p>Especially for the long tail of start-ups, this isn't always feasible but would be Really Valuable to have -- certainly for a feasible monthly fee. This is because smaller players depend a lot more on user contributions to grow the value of their offerings for the customer base as a whole.<p>Translated my Shareware into your language? That will make you 500 X. Signed up for our newsletter? That's 50. Following on Twitter or ""Fanned"" on Facebook? Another 50.<p>At the same time it would be awesome for the solution to translate these points back into value for those who have it. X points then get you another n months of ""free"" premium support, n additional users for your license or a discount of n for your license upgrade --- or whatever value is being exchanged.<p>Of course, ultimately it would be even better if these ""points programs"" (which would be like Ning networks -- everyone can roll their own or join an existing program) could allow for inter-currency trade. If you lost interest in the benefits <i>my</i> company can offer for your points, maybe you can trade them in with another provider who is willing to participate.<p>I know that originally money is the ultimate currency for exchanging value, services or goods. At the same time there's this psychological resistance about money. For the recipient, it immediately brings external motivation into something you were about to do anyway for intrinsic reasons, and you have to start doing calculations and get out of the ""flow of doing something worthwhile just for its own sake"" -- whereas, if you just get ""brownie points"" those are simply nice to have around and enjoy their value at a later point, without being all economical about it. For the other party, they wouldn't pay money for newsletter signups or social followers but they know that ultimately these do have monetary value for them, they just don't and can't know the exact figures. So that's why even though I acknowledge the ""supremacy of real money"" for most serious transactions, I see a great need for and great value in this.<p>Virtual currencies and brownie-point credit systems have proven their case, and now what we need is a white label / Ning-like ""roll your own"" provider.<p><i>Do you know</i> of any startup or other entity working in that space, or existing services providing a sub-set of the above requirements?<p>Apart from monthly recurring income, I see revenue potentials for everything else you can do with virtual currencies. Just like PayPal, you can ""keep a cut"" of every ""transaction"", and then later hopefully somehow convert it even back into real money, or at least cash in on some of the stuff the brownie points get you in your own system.<p>Why don't I do it myself? I ran into this need while working on something else -- and I don't intend to abandon it, or cut down on my time investments for that at the moment. If I started developing this myself, I might get caught in just a similar situation with another need then coming up. Ideally I want to learn about existing solutions -- or about anyone doing this -- or about anyone having read this who is fired up enough about the idea to get started on building a prototype for this  ;)<p>Thanks for listening...",1270255877

FICA alone is about 15% and medicare is about 3%.)<p>You pay medicare on all earned income.

Below $100k, they aren't.<p>No, you don't pay FICA above $105k, but you also don't get benefits from higher contributions.<p>Someone else pointed out how the benefits change as a function of contributions so I'll point out why SS advocates set up the system with a cap on both contributions and benefits.<p>If the system has uncapped contributions and benefits, it will end up paying Ross Perot $500k/year.  I suspect that you're not willing to do that.<p>If the system has uncapped contributions and capped benefits, rich people will pay a lot more attention and work to reduce SS because that would be a huge hunk of money.<p>The other alternative, capped contributions and uncapped benefits is a non-starter.<p>That leaves us with the current system, capped contributions and benefits.

However, a bandit, by his gain, can give himself more resources with which to continue his banditry. A stupid person, on the other hand, will tend to deprive himself of resources.<p>For example, I decide I want to be nasty. I'll drive around town and siphon gasoline out of people's cars. As a bandit, I might put this gas in my tank, thus enabling me to drive on to the next victim. I'm not a perfect bandit, since it cost me some gas to get to my victim, and so the total amount of available gasoline in the world is reduced by my actions, but I do gain somewhat. On the other hand, as a stupid person, I might simply dump the siphoned gas on the ground. And eventually, I run out of gas, making it more difficult for me to victimize others.<p>(Okay, I'll stop taking it seriously now.)",1270253086

The evidence is overwhelming at this point that the average programmer finds the former easier than the latter, despite well over a decade of denial by some of the more vociferous advocates of FP.<p>Those people would do well to emulate DPP's example here and recognize that the long-term success of FP depends on selling to the right audience at the right time and not promoting it as a panacea.",1315400324

2969300,comment,2967622,2968314,26,0,eitally,,,"The problem, kamaal, is that to get reliably high quality software engineers and designers in India you actually do have to spend nearly what you'd be paying in most of the US (the whole country, excepting NYC, Boston, LA, Bay Area, Seattle, and a few other hot spots) and it's much more challenging to recruit than it is in the US.  There are problems with candidates cross shopping offers, professional interviewees, horrendous private sector communications infrastructure, governmental dysfunction, inflation, sexism, and familial pressure to strive for ever-increasing job titles in household name companies.<p>I don't mean to say India doesn't make sense, and I employ about 225 folks in Chennai right now, but it is apples to oranges and decision makers do not often have the right data to make informed choices over where to hire.  As an example of something completely removed from quality of personnel, the time difference can wreak havoc on its own, especially when the stakeholders and developers are in different hemispheres.  This holds not just for the development process but also in post-deployment support.  It naturally (and unfortunately) leads to situations where the one or two engineers in the same general location as the stakeholders end up usurping the responsibility from the remote staff just out of convenient and self-consciousness of the 1-2 day lag they've been burned by over and over again.  I could write a book on this subject (I've gone from being an individual contributor developer to a senior director reporting to the CIO over the last 7yrs and have seen nearly everything), but let's not belabor it.  The executive summary is that offshoring is hard and too many managers only look at it from a direct labor cost perspective, which is folly.<p>Yes, we live in a globalized world and it will only continue to shrink.  At the point where everyone has a phone or tablet with wireless unfiltered gigabit internet everywhere they need it, we'll be in good shape.",1315399356

We may also look at other algorithms but currently a variation of YBWC seems the most promising.<p>In terms of strength, we'll add the UCI protocol to be able to run games against other engines. We'll see how it performs but we don't expect to beat Stockfish easily, even with a very large number of nodes. That will be part of the experiment and we'll be happy to publish the results.<p>Now, another path to get real performance would be to find a way of using webGL on the workers.

I've found our local barcamps to have been a mixed bag, and it really depended on the quality of the people who showed up that day.  They used to run it where everyone pitched during the morning, then self organized around the pitched sessions.  That made the sessions <i>totally</i> up in the air - you had no idea when you woke up if it was even worth showing up.  Later ones set up early pitching/voting on the web, which seemed to help some, but because there was no ticket cost, the organizers were still on the hook trying to determine food cost and such in advance, when just a little bad weather might keep away loads of people.<p>The area ncdevcon.com (next week in Raleigh) started charging for tickets this year - a nominal $60 for 2 days - precisely because when it was free, people wouldn't show up on the day because they had no real investment.<p>For indieconf.com, we've charged - both for last year's even and this year's event - and are posting speakers/sessions well in advance so people know what they're getting.<p>There's room for all styles of events, certainly, and perhaps I have bit more invested emotionally than others, being an organizer myself, but the barcamp self-organizing doesn't always produce great results.  This may also have something to do with geography as well, but I don't think anyone's done an actual study of barcamp attendee satisfaction around the globe.

2969256,comment,2968900,2968900,14,0,ilamont,,,"About four years ago I interviewed Ray Kurzweil, and asked him about the issue of old data formats. In <i>Singularity</i> or one of his earlier papers or books, he had lamented the inaccessibility of old data, which prompted me to ask about the role of standards. His response:<p><i>We do use standard formats, and the standard formats are continually changed, and the formats are not always backwards compatible. It's a nice goal, but it actually doesn't work.<p>I have in fact electronic information that in fact goes back through many different computer systems. Some of it now I cannot access. In theory I could, or with enough effort, find people to decipher it, but it's not readily accessible. The more backwards you go, the more of a challenge it becomes.<p>And despite the goal of maintaining standards, or maintaining forward compatibility, or backwards compatibility, it doesn't really work out that way. Maybe we will improve that. Hard documents are actually the easiest to access. Fairly crude technologies like microfilm or microfiche which basically has documents are very easy to access.<p>So ironically, the most primitive formats are the ones that are easiest.<p>So something like acrobat documents, which are basically trying to preserve a flat document, is actually a pretty good format, and is likely to last a pretty long time. But I am not confident that these standards will remain. I think the philosophical implication is that we have to really care about knowledge. If we care about knowledge it will be preserved. And this is true knowledge in general, because knowledge is not just information. Because each generation is preserving the knowledge it cares about and of course a lot of that knowledge is preserved from earlier times, but we have to sort of re-synthesize it and re-understand it, and appreciate it anew.</i><p>Source:<p><a href=""http://blogs.computerworld.com/the_kurzweil_interview_continued_portable_computing_virtual_reality_immortality_and_strong_vs_narrow_ai"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.computerworld.com/the_kurzweil_interview_contin...</a>",1315398242

2969235,comment,2969177,2969177,1,0,edgeplay,,,"I find it unclear how group driving an RC car is supposed to benefit a child with Autism.  There was no identification of what autism classification might benefit the most and how.  Additionally, while the act of two people standing side by side, directing the car is social (more than 1 person doing something), I fail to see how that interaction is meaningful, as a therapy tool.<p>If I was going to stretch on behalf of the article, if the autistic child could initiate all cues, ie turn left, there may be something to that, maybe.  Oftentimes, verbal autistic children, that speak in sentences, have the ability to state the obvious or memorized items (scripted echolalia).  This discourages spontaneous language and could be counter productive.<p>Oftentimes, social therapy has to do with an inability to empathize, failure to read social cues and / or a lack of inclination to interact with others.  If the child is watching the car, I fail to see how any of the aforementioned issues are addressed.  Furthermore, the vision of the child embracing working together, leading the directional discussion and successfully driving the car, is a very high bar.  I think it would be more likely that the child gets frustrated in the inability to complete the task, a typical outcome associated with rigidity.<p>I would be interested to read any documentation that suggest or has data contrary to my impression.",1315397560

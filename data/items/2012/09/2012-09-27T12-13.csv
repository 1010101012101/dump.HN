4580430,comment,4580285,4580285,1,0,Agustus,,,"It is amazing how this is a story that was caused by politician choices and the lack of supply and demand economics within a legislative body.
1.The shortage is projected for Europe, but the cause is blamed on American corn prices; this is not only due to the drought but also the allocation of corn to ethanol requirements. If one goes to the farming statistics kept by the U.S., (<a href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/feed-grains-database/</a>) the amount of corn produced has been increasing. But, because of political motivations, we need to burn portions of it, thus driving up the price.
2. The cost of raising pigs, legally, has gone up. In Florida there was an amendment to ban a method of raising pigs, those facilities had to adopt a new method, thus driving costs up.",1348750747

4580412,comment,4579053,4579137,4,0,Arjuna,,,"<i>""It's about time a major player got behind Linux [...]""</i><p>What about id Software?<p>They have a long-standing history of support for the platform, including John Carmack's philosophy and advocation of OSS that has driven his contribution of id Software game engine source code to the community, up to and including id Tech 4.<p>He even cares so deeply about the topic that he worked to keep id Tech 5 free from the shackles of proprietary code, because he wants to eventually release it as open source. He said (italic emphasis is mine):<p>""'Do we want to integrate some other vendor's solution, some proprietary code into this?' And the answer's usually no, because eventually id Tech 5 is going to be open source also. This is still the law of the land at id, that the policy is that we're not going to integrate stuff that's going to make it impossible for us to do an eventual open source release. We can argue the exact pros and cons from a pure business standpoint on it, and I can at least make some, perhaps somewhat, contrived cases that I think it's good for the business, <i>but as a personal conviction it's still pretty important to me and I'm standing by that.</i>"" [1]<p>I think the reality is that id Software has attempted to build the market-space, but the base just hasn't been there. For example, John had this to say recently at QuakeCon 2012:<p>""Other interesting sort of PC-ish platforms, we have... the Mac still remains a viable platform for us. The Mac has never required any charity from id, all of those ports have carried their own weight there; they've been viable business platforms.<p>[...]<p>Linux is an issue that's taken a lot more currency with Valve announcing Steam for Linux, and that does change, factor, you know, changes things a bit, but we've made two forays into the Linux commercial market, most recently with Quake Live client, and, you know, that platform just hasn't carried its weight compared to the Mac on there. It's great that people are enthusiastic about it, but there's just not nearly as many people that are interested in paying for a game on the platform, and that just seems to be the reality. Valve will probably pull a bunch more people there. I know absolutely nothing about any Valve plans for console, Steam-box stuff on there; I can speculate without violating anything.<p>[...]<p>So, it's enticing, the thought there that you might have a well-supported, completely open platform that you could deliver content through the Steam ecosystem there. It's a tough sell on there, but Valve gets huge kudos for having the vision for what they did with Steam, sticking through all of it. It's funny talking about Doom 3, where we can remember back in the days when they're like, 'Well, should you ship Doom 3 on Steam, go out there, make a splash?' ... I'm like, 'You're kidding, right?' That made no sense at all at that time, but you know Valve stuck with it and they're in a really enviable position from all of that now.<p>It still seems, probably crazy to me that they would be doing anything like that, you know, but, it's something that's not technically impossible, but would be really difficult from a market, sort of ecosystems standpoint.""

I mean, this is still around 19 to 29 times more than what traditional 3D methods are using for environmental mapping.

[Edit: But he's right here, for photorealism you probably want a combination of methods, like ray tracing and radiosity or ray tracing and photon mapping]<p>Complexity: For raytracing, you can store the scene in very efficient data structures, so you do NOT have to search your ""billions of triangles"" for each ray. Also, you can make sure rays degrade quickly since you trace them from the camera backwards to the light source, as you have pointed out.<p>""How do you raytrace stars""?

4580396,comment,4578484,4578484,1,0,jfdimark,,,"I think there are 2 key issues at play here:<p>1. The difference between user expectations and delivery<p>2. Not enough of a narrative and different levels of motivations<p>1. This is where you expect something to be really easy, or really amazing, or really beautiful but instead get something simply easy, amazing, or beautiful.  The fact it doesnt have the superlative means a slight let-down or disappointment.<p>When I tackled Hartls RoR tutorial, he made it clear that even just getting starting by installing and configuring the tools and environment can be a bit of bitch, particularly for new comers.  Sure enough, when I encountered problem after problem, I was mentally prepared that this could happen.  I wasnt discouraged.<p>I think Codeacademy would be well served to provide some kind of contextual introduction for how difficult  but ultimately rewarding  programming can be.  Rather, it makes it sounds like a stroll in the park with some friends that can be picked up at the drop of a hat.  This is inevitably going to lead to frustration when the user finds this isnt the case.  Their expectations are not matched by the reality.<p>A second aspect to this is that programming is different than other pursuits you may do in your spare time, like sports, writing or drawing.  For example if youre a bad pool player, writer or drawer you can still play, write and draw till your hearts content and reach the end of the game/book/picture.  It doesnt matter whether youre good or not.<p>But with coding, you cant just offer up any old attempt at the code and have a program run for you.  It has to be correct code.  So it becomes the equivalent of saying why not come play an awesome game of pool with your friends, but when you turn up theres a cranky coach who wont let you take a shot unless you have perfect form and execution.  Or a writing class where the teacher crosses out your work in red pen and wont let anyone read it until it is grammatically perfect and conveys your meaning in perfect clarity and beautiful prose!  I can imagine these activities would quickly get frustrating too in such a context, and wind up losing your interest unless you were prepared for such rigor.<p>2. The second issue with Codecademy is a lack of narrative.  Other comments point out that there are multiple entry points and it doesnt always get you to follow a linear path.  This is something that services like Treehouse try to improve upon (I started learning HTML and CSS with them) by bringing elements of gamification to the tasks.  You win badges, unlock new lessons, get treated to funny videos, take quizzes and it generally feels like youre progressing as part of a narrative.<p>The problem with learning to code is that most exercises are pretty dull and repetitive.  Theyre like Mr Miyagis wax on wax off lessons  its hard to see the point to them without knowing the end goal.  The reason why Daniel LaRusso continues to do this annoying tasks if because he has a really powerful motivation to do so.  He knows he wants to master karate to stand up to bullies and prove himself in the sport.<p>I think for anyone who casually just thinks learning to code sounds fun then theyre doomed to failure, because it is hard work and has a lot of obstacles to overcome.  Whereas someone who has a business idea or a problem they really want to be able to solve will happily stick with it, because they have a vision for what it will help them achieve.  Im not sure how Codecademy could possibly cater to these different types of individual.  One amazingly cool way though, would be ask at the beginning describe what you want to build and create an algorithm that could match the types of functionality required with the video content that would help you build it.  Then youd have a really, really compelling, tailored narrative that helps you to your end goal.  Then, for the more casual user, they could try and think of more fun, practical applications they can work towards building to give them a sense of purpose.<p>As everyone has referenced though, Codecademy  and others like it  is an amazing step in the right direction, and will only get better with time.  The fact that people care about it is a major indicator that it is on the right track and will ultimately succeed.",1348750230

The author seems to forget that Netscape was a huge threat to Microsoft.  Microsoft then shifted their strategy to focus on the web in, what I would argue, is one of the more impressive pivots by a large company.  That pivot led to Internet Explorer crushing Netscape and becoming the number 1 browser.  It also led to a radical reinvention of the Microsoft developer toolset to focus on the web - ASP, ASP.NET, etc.  These technologies may now be passe, but they were pretty cutting edge at the time.  And even though Microsoft has now, in my opinion, fallen really far behind in the world (missing most of mobile, etc), you can't say that it was a miscalculation to go after Netscape - think of where they'd be if they'd not gone after them.",1348750042

I've had the impression memcached is more solid.<p>For static caching I use nginx with fastcgi_cache. This makes WP-Supercache obsolete. I bybass the cache for requests containing certain cookies, so that logged in users always receive fresh pages.<p>Another big Wordpress performance sink is locales. If you have a blog in a non-english language consider using a language-caching plugin.

Searching for my town ""Brno"" just brings up regular search results with no option to view a map. Searching for ""London"" brings up more,  so there's a new header giving me the options of narrowing my results by ""all"", ""images"", ""video"" or ""news"" but still no maps.<p>This is not a suitable replacement for Google maps, I'll be deleting it.",1348747808

Unfortunately the event was sponsored by IBM, so ther was potential for a conflict of interest.<p>He requested to see the source code and the game logs which was denied by IBM. IBM also disassembled the computer immediately after the match to re-purpose the computer for protein folding.<p>I think this book is rewriting history. Kasparov was devastated.",1348747794

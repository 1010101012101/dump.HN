When it came for the Julia implementation, I wanted to keep it as similar as possible to the tuned Cython implementation for pedagogical purposes.<p>In general, if anyone has performance improvements or code cleanups to the Cython PAVA code [1] (the implementation used by scikit-learn), please benchmark and send a pull request over to the scikit-learn team. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be very happy to accept improvements.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/_isotonic.pyx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/skl...</a>",1394593195

I worked (hard) for over 5+ years and left them recently due to limited growth opportunities within the startup. I believe the startup will have a decent exit (nothing remarkable, but =~$50M to $100M) based on steady growth and its valuations in last few rounds.<p>After leaving the startup recently, I sent an email to the founder and HR attaching executed exercise notice but without any payment (as I didn&#x27;t know where to wire the money etc.). I didn&#x27;t receive any response from them until 5 days after the vested options expired due to 90-day expiration rule of ISO options set by IRS. I followed up multiple times (before expiration) but didn&#x27;t hear back.<p>A week after expiration, I received a response from founder (who cc&#x27;ed the lawyers) saying that I could exercise the options and send them a check. Within few minutes of his emails (yeah, it was a setup), the lawyers replied saying I couldn&#x27;t exercise them as I was past 90-days which IRS mandates.<p>Now I understand that IRS has a 90-day rule here. but what are my options considering the startup founder/HR intentionally didn&#x27;t let me exercise?<p>Notes:\n1. I took paycuts for the options early in the startup tenure (a mistake which I fixed later). so I hate to see the options just go away like this. \n2. If options are part of compensation, why do vested options expire after 90-days? I understand ISO rule by IRS, but shouldn&#x27;t startup employees opt for NSO&#x27;s etc.? The vested options correspond to work that I already did in the past. I fail to understand this rationally.

Let&#x27;s take The Great Gatsby as a quick example:<p>Google shows the US release date as May 1 2013 in cinemas, with the DVD release on August 27 2013 - nearly 4 months after it&#x27;s first out. By this time people will have been downloading a version of the film for at least a couple of months.<p>Very few cinemas will still be screening the film after 3 months, so where does one go to see it in that period? The easy answer is to the internet.<p>I believe that people will pay, and Spotify has huge success in releasing albums either early, at the same time or very shortly after physical release. Whilst this wouldn&#x27;t be possible with films due to the fact that there isn&#x27;t much of a secondary market (bands now taking the attitude that albums are a support to merch/shows), there is a need to rethink how quickly people can get access to films. If an HD rip is available after 2 months then perhaps iTunes should be ready to release the film at a higher price point (as they already do for some early digital releases) for those who are willing to pay the extra.",1394590712

I&#x27;m sure most of us have encountered an irritating website that tried to block right click and ctrl-c, but it&#x27;s trivial to get around it. What if it weren&#x27;t?<p>For some reason, we&#x27;ve accepted the idea that video is a special thing that you can&#x27;t easily grab snippets of and share. I think it&#x27;s mostly because DRM showed up before there were consumer friendly tools to do it (like ctrl-c for text), rather than some special attribute of video as a copyrightable work.<p>If we accept DRM protected video, what do we say when a photographer comes around and says &quot;Hey, why can&#x27;t I protect my photos like that?&quot; A lot of websites already try, but we have screenshots and noscript to work around it.<p>Or further down the line, what happens when writers start to ask &quot;Video is protected against copying, why doesn&#x27;t the browser disable copying from my article?&quot; And all of a sudden I can&#x27;t copy a quote out to email to my mom without either retyping it or taking a photo and running OCR. Easier than exercising fair use on an encrypted video stream, but still an annoying extra step for something that I ought to have the right to do.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think video should get to be special, and if you wouldn&#x27;t accept DRM on every single piece of content then you shouldn&#x27;t accept it on videos either.",1394590027

Assuming identical OS and arch, you&#x27;ve probably got:<p>* software packages that should be identical on all nodes in the cluster<p>* a set of software packages that should be installed on all nodes<p>* configuration that should be identical (e.g. 99% of an nginx config)<p>* configuration that is unique to the host (e.g. a hostname)<p>Or perhaps:<p>* packages limited to a single OS (traditional software packages for Linux)<p>* packages limited to a single organization (identical portions of configs)<p>* packages limited to a single node (hostname)<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m playing around with using Nix for all but the unique-per-host stuff.

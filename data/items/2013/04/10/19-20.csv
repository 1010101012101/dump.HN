There are locations in most cities that are not efficiently or safely reachable via bus. Visitors to cities also tend to need point-to-point transit; it takes some know-how and a lot of flexibility to get from an airport to a business meeting in a near suburb, for instance. Taxicabs are effectively a privatized component of metro transport systems.<p>Cities therefore have a powerful interest in making sure that whatever else happens, there is a strata of taxi service available to all residents of the city at some predictable rate.",1365623439

The whole concept largely post-dates the founding (remember, Adam Smith was a contemporary of the founding fathers, and his ideas wouldn't turn into modern free-market principles until much later). I'm sure at some point it was perceived that it was beneficial for Texas to force sales through Texas franchises rather than allow out of state car manufacturers to sell directly to Texas citizens.<p>The state-affiliated monopolies are a different situation. They exist because state and local governments wanted something for nothing. They wanted taxi services to serve poor people and far-flung parts of cities, and they wanted telecom services to do the same. In a free market, all these service providers wouldn't do that--they'd focus their efforts only on the most profitable areas. So the governments reached a bargain: the companies agree to serve everybody, and in return they get a monopoly. That's why Uber isn't allowed to ""compete"" with the local taxi companies--those taxi companies get a monopoly in exchange for their willingness to venture into the Bronx.<p>Take a look at airfare. It's dramatically more expensive to fly from Richmond, VA to Eugene, OR than from New York, NY to San Francisco, CA, even though both trips are roughly the same distance. But cab fares are uniform (per mile) throughout a government's service area, as are utility rates usually. How does this happen?",1365623343

Generally you wouldn't get ships on a lake that size, large boats sure, but not ships. Those boats generally don't need a lot of ballast, particularly because you are't going to get really large waves on a body of water that small. Even if you did, does it even make sense to move ballast stones down to the shore, then put them on a boat across this small of a distance, just to dump them, when in the same amount of time you could probably just load up a mule/horse/camel train and walk around the lake, and for better profit than pulling down the stones. (Note there is lots of historical evidence for trade by boat on the sea, I'm just not convinced of the need for ballast stones, and there is nothing on one side of the lake or the other that suggests an empty return voyage even makes sense).<p>Some other problems with this theory:<p>1) Ballast piles from wrecks are much much smaller than 50 meters by 50 meters, and not 5m high.<p>2) dumping ballast stones wouldn't occur in such a well confined way resembling a pile - there would be more outlying boulders, potentially increasing in density towards a central spot (the designated dump spot) rather than a pile with edges like this.<p>3) 4000 years ago, it is not clear to me that there were ships with the right properties to need balast stones anywhere.

If anything, it might even make them a tiny bit faster.  But speed isn't the reason you'd want TCO: you want it as a stack optimization so that tail-recursive functions use constant stack space.  Furthermore, although the C specification places no TCO requirement on implementors, it's actually a very reasonable optimization even in C.  GCC actually <i>does</i> do TCO in some cases (I'm using 4.5.3, and tail-call elimination occurs with -O2 and higher).<p>> Clojure can't have TCO because the Java Virtual Machine doesn't support it. So they have a workaround (trampolines).<p>This is true. There was a time when TCO support was slated for Java 7.  That time has come and gone; unofficially, it looks like it may make an appearance in Java 9 at the earliest.<p>> Python doesn't support TCO because... it screws up stack traces?<p>That's the cited reason, but it's horseshit.  As others have pointed out on this thread, it's feasible to simply disable TCO when doing debugging if you need a stack trace.

We work extensively with very little children, and over the last 10 years I developed my own method that works great for the 3-7yo age group. It is based on fun and game-like competitive activities. All of my teachers are using this method now, and it's a great success.<p>Over the last two years I've been working on transferring these activities into a format of a mobile or tablet app. I currently have the entire structure and the content for this potential app: eight 'games getting progressively harder through several levels.<p>Many of our students' parents were asking me for a recommendation for a good music theory app, and so I've been frequently checking what is out there on the marked.

Under our (Manticore) calling convention, we would just jump to each of those continuations and wouldn't have to grow stack (though in our case, it's keeping around heap frames, as we're not stack-based), and would have the same next allocation and instruction-level behavior as a tail call.<p>That said, if you think tail calls are hard to debug, CPS-converted programs would destroy most people's will to live.

Apart from stars and thermonuclear weapons, <i>there are no fusion reactions that yield more energy than they require</i>, i.e. the achieve break-even. It has not happened.<p>> Thus, if you can do fusion at all, you will end up with more total energy than you started with.<p>You just changed the subject. Apart from stars and weapons, existing experimental fusion reactions produce much less energy than is required to create them. For example, all the laboratory experiments to date.<p>Also, very important, in a fusion reactor at less than break-even, the input power must be used to perpetually sustain the reaction (the state of the plasma), so that power is unavailable for any other purpose. Only the fusion reaction's power can be exploited.<p>So in a hypothetical reactor that requires 1000 watts to sustain fusion but produces 250 watts of fusion power, only the 250 watt fraction is expoitable -- the original power must be reserved for heating the plasma. That's why break-even is essential.<p>>> If this project were to succeed, it would instantly replace the existing approaches (i.e. tokamak and laser inertial confinement) as the most promising candidate for large-scale fusion power generation.<p>> No, it wouldn't.<p>Yes, it would. Given a power gain > 1, it would be child's play to generate steam and spin a turbine, as just one example.<p>> And research into fusion generators that work pretty much like that has been and is being done.<p>To date, there have been no -- that's NO -- laboratory fusion generators that produce more power than they require for initiation.",1365621162

5527266,comment,5526214,5526214,29,0,Anechoic,,,"My common courtesy wake-up call: MIT mechanical engineering students often had to go through the course ""secretary"" to see their faculty advisers of high-level MechE professors. At the time, the course secretary was a middle-aged women with a desk outside of the MechE administrative offices. When you walked into the office, you spoke with her and she would send you to the appropriate faculty office.<p>Whenever any of my (mostly male) coursemates talked about visiting the office, they always referred to her as ""bitch,"" ""cunt,"" ""hag"" etc. I never understood this - she had never been anything but nice and respectful to me. After one interaction I witnessed between the secretary and another student, I finally began to understand. Those other students really saw her as just a ""secretary"" who had no business running interference between students that were clearly her betters. I on the otherhand never went out of my way to ingratiate myself to her, but I did treat her as a human worthy of the same respect as any other faculty member, and I guess she noticed.<p>One year, I signed up for more classes than I intended to take with the intention of auditing the classes, deciding what I wanted to take and then dropping the excess classes before the drop date. I decided pretty quickly to drop one of the classes, and therefore didn't attend any of the lectures or do any of the coursework, but I procrastinated in getting the signature of my adviser to drop the class.<p>Eventually the drop date loomed, and I realized I had only a couple of days to get that signature. I walked into the MechE office, exchanged pleasantries with the secretary and asked to see my adviser. ""Oh I'm sorry,"" she replied ""he's out of the country for the next two weeks."" She saw from my reaction that something was wrong, and I explained that if I didn't get my adviser's signature on the drop form ASAP, I'd fail the class. She smiled and told me that in situations like that she actually had discretionary power to sign forms on behalf of absent professors. She asked for the form, signed it (in her name) and gave it back to me. I was all set. A year after that, I handed in my thesis and forgot to sign a form. She called me and waited after hours for me to run down to the office to sign the form so I could graduate on time. All because I treated her like a human being.<p>I later told some of my coursemates about that, and they had absolutely no idea she had that kind of power. I like to think that maybe they started treating her a little better after learning what a little courtesy can accomplish. But I certainly learned that ""little people"" can hold great power that can be wielded in your favor if you just treat them like you want to be treated.",1365620413

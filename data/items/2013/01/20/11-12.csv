I don't know how you originally got into programming, but imagine you were good at it during your early teens, like many of us, and like Aaron.  Now imagine that when you met the outside world, people <i>other</i> than your parents were amazed at your ability - imagine you wangled your way onto a W3C committee at 14.  Now imagine that by sheer blind following of the next interesting thing, and talking to the next interesting person, you wangled your way into Y Combinator and into the Reddit sale.  You're damn good at programming, but it turns out that being great at writing and programming doesn't translate at all into being good at business.<p>When I was 14, I assumed that I was going to program computers and get rich, much like Gates or Jobs.  Aaron got a <i>hell</i> of a lot further down that adolescent trajectory than I did - I had all kinds of intermediate small failures along the way to soften the blow when it turned out I wasn't good at business.  Now, ten years later, I've learned to be better at business.<p>Aaron bounced off, apparently really hard.  He longed for those days when - just by talking and thinking and coding - he was taken as a surprising genius by people he'd never met.  He wanted to walk in and surprise people with the fait accompli, cut right to the chase of being admired.<p>Or so I imagine.  Because I know that at his age I thought <i>exactly</i> that way.  I even have depressive tendencies - never been bothered by suicidal ideation, but then I never failed so badly as he did after the Reddit sale, and I could certainly see that happening to me in that case.<p>I may very well be projecting.  But essentially, when I look at this, I just think, there but for the grace of early failure and family commitments go I.",1358682863
5086655,comment,5086528,5086528,11,0,Maro,,,"I recently spent 2 days working on a renovation project at a local slum here in Hungary. The slum is a couple hundred gipsy families, living in unfinished/abandoned houses without water, gas/heating, they steal electricity off the grid. This was during the winter, so most houses just had one heated room, using wood. The houses didn't have bathrooms, everything smelled of urine, thrash was left all over the place, inside, outside, everywhere. Since the locals steal from each other, there were very few movable/valuable objects, like tables or chairs. Interestingly though, most houses had an LCD TV, which was surreal, poeple living in quasi-homeless conditions but watching TV all day. Many families had 5-10 kids, possibly because of lack of protection and because wellfare is linear in the # of kids here. Many kids were at home all day sitting around in dirty clothes. I heard one father argue with a kid and threaten him with school as punishment. According to locals drugs are a huge problem, with most teenagers having tried out drugs or being users. Adults were also at home, obviously uneducated and unemployed, possibly without acceptable ""work ethics"". The experience was a bit like a post-apocalyptic movie.<p>One of the aid people said in an interview that to ""fix"" this, ie. to reintegrate this group of people into society will take 2 generations in her opinion, because the social patterns in their heads have to change (don't steal, go to school, work, keep a tidy house), and that takes time. I agree.<p>I don't think just money would help. After I came back the 2nd day, I tried to imagine what would happen if one of these families got a really nice house and a bunch of money to go along with it. But since they lack the social skills to handle property and a law-abiding, ""civil life"", I think many would gradually destroy the house, spend/lose the money, and then end back where they started.<p>TLDR: Ending poverty involves changing people, which takes generations.<p>This is the project:<p><a href=""http://www.bagazs.org/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bagazs.org/en/</a><p>-<p>An interesting (perhaps) afterthought I had after the renovation work was whether trying to change people (the gipsies in Hungary) is moral. As a group I believe gipsies have always lived a different life, navigating at the edge of society, living in their own communities. Maybe it's just us who should change and just accept that they want to live a different life? I don't know, this line of thinking reminds me of Daniel Quinn's Ishmael, where the author argues that perhaps our way of life is only special because it's aggressive, in that we annihilate or assimilate other cultures and cannot live alongside them.",1358682861

The complexity of proper CSG validation can be exploited for resource-depletion/DOS attacks, while <i>not</i> validating the syntax of a message leaves part of the program that <i>uses</i> the data in these messages with potentially invalid data, putting it into an inconsistent state, possibly leading to DOS or worse exploits.<p>At least that's what I got from their presentation, which was very interesting BTW, especially the part about ""weird machines""--that's basically the inconsistent state, the emergent machine that is made out of all the things an attacker can make a system do by exploiting it.

The old sayings that when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail and that its dangerous to put all your eggs in one basket are as true as they ever were, and many of these modern, opinionated frameworks and plug-ins are excellent case studies.<p>Sometimes, using opinionated tools is a strength. If what you want to build fits a frameworks natural usage, you can get up to speed quickly and avoid much of the laborious infrastructure work that otherwise goes with starting a new project. That can be a <i>big</i> win.<p>However, sometimes it is a weakness. If you want to do something that isnt quite what the framework does, breaking out of the box can be expensive, maybe even prohibitively so. Moreover, that applies not just when you first start a project, but also as the project grows and evolves, perhaps beyond the scale/scope the original tools were ever intended to support. And even if someone else comes along with a tool that is more suitable, it can be difficult to migrate.<p>If all you know is how to glue components together, you can take advantage of the strengths, but youll struggle to overcome the weaknesses, and worse, youll never create new tools that serve you better or let you create something that isnt merely a recipe made from the ingredients someone else gave you.<p>I thought it was sad the other day, when MailChimps annual report web page[1] was doing the rounds on the web design forums because of some interesting effects used in its presentation, and the first question asked usually wasnt How does that work? but Does anyone know a plug-in to do that in $FRAMEWORK?

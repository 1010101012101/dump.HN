I guess you agree that our nations have things in common: kind of stubbornness but also wild imagination. There are even some old historical sayings about it.. We seem to have completely non-transparent politicians and similar economic struggles as well. Still your country seems to have good opinion in the wild and also Budapest seems more civilized than our capital, which is important for multinational companies. \nI guess the best we can do is to risk build something ourselves when the right moment comes -- read: when we have some savings for at least couple of months. If we fail we will be still considered as early adopters of tech things (because what we decide to use is usually better and more modern than so-called ""industry standards"") which is good for finding another job.<p>Since 2 years I'm switching between consulting and doing own stuff every several months - it didn't generated big income but I build few non-profit things which is also very good and gave me lots of experience.

The ability to experiment so easily is a major part of the appeal for many of us.<p>> Even the stereotypical ""impractical"" research algorithms\n> (with efficient complexity but huge constants) are\n> implemented.<p>Well, they're all Turing machines, but you're not going to find any video processing algorithms that were implemented on a 4K Altair so let's not go too far.<p>It's interesting to consider a given novel idea and wonder how far back in time it would have been possible to implement it in a practical way and how much further back in time it would have been useful simply to know how it works.<p>Let me pick a concrete example that we are all familiar with: Hashing.  Hashing and hash lookup algorithms have been around a long time.  It's an area that people might expect would have been exhausted of significant new ideas long ago.  Not so!  Cuckoo hashing was invented in 2001 and gives us dramatically more efficient use of memory at a slight performance cost.  It can make the difference between a hash table that fits in memory and one that doesn't so it's a meaningful advance.<p>Cuckoo hashing could have been implemented on a 4k Altair and it would have been useful there.  But no one had the idea then.<p>But wait-- It gets stranger!  Cuckoo hashing was literally under our noses and somehow no one saw it!  It is a variation of set associative hashing which is what most CPUs had already been doing in their caches for years.  It's not exactly the same algorithm but if you check you'll see it's so close the distinctions are minor.<p>Fascinating, isn't it?

1610664,comment,1608285,1610136,0,0,korch,,,"You are absolutely right in pointing out that Linux has greatly benefited from being able to run Oracle. But I would argue that Linux no longer needs Oracle more than Oracle needs Linux. Linux has been mainstream for many years now, while Oracle has lost a lot of ground to Mysql, Postgres, etc and is greatly waning in influence. (Even though Oracle will never go away, much in the same way IBM and mainframes will never go away).<p>IMHO Ellison's lack of distinction between ""take"" & ""use"" is <i>precisely</i> the harm. The danger is how easily that becomes the <i>Embrace & Extinguish</i> strategy. He obviously sees no such distinction himself and imagines that he's big and powerful enough to just take whatever he wants. He sounds like a modern day warlord, and not in the good way. In my book, any individual who assumes that much power, without giving back in proportion, deserves to be shut down on general principle. How is it possible to respect one of the  most eminent business leaders on Earth when he shoots his dumb mouth off in public like that? At best he reveals his inability to strategize & maintain coalitions, and at worst he reveals his sociopathic hubris. Being so mighty he would do well to learn the value of at least trying to listen to the advice of his PR viziers, and wear a false-face of humility in public, so as to not trigger indefensible public outrage. Which would lead to eventual Federal investigations—anyone as big as Oracle has a graveyard of skeletons buried in the basement.<p>I can forgive accidents, stupidity, and even short-term, limited corporate greed(implicit in <i>The Game</i>); but never when it's backed by the treacherous potential to cause long-term harm to much weaker open source allies. Linux, Java, Apache and other open source software projects are not mere pawns to be moved around the chess board upon which Oracle, Apple, Google and IBM engage in battle.<p>I hope the hippie idealism of open source populism hasn't been drowned in the ocean of money, but is instead still alive & kicking—Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers!<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_Against_the_Wall_Motherfuckers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_Against_the_Wall_Motherfucke...</a>",1282037126

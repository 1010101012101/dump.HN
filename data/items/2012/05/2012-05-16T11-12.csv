Most of these features fix up glaring deficiencies of JavaScript, rather than just extending the language to support more functionality.<p>CoffeeScript's handling of equality comparisons is a great example of this. The only reason it provides a benefit is because the typical way of doing it in JavaScript is so stupidly broken. This is completely a non-issue for basically every other sensibly-designed programming language around.<p>The relationship between CoffeeScript and JavaScript is in fact a very different relationship than we see between C and C++, or C and Objective-C, for example. C++ and Objective-C are built upon C, not with the intent of fixing numerous inherent problems with it, but rather by augmenting it and increasing its power and flexibility. But that's what happens when you're building upon an already-solid foundation like C, rather than a fractured, incoherent mess like JavaScript.",1337168970

3981602,comment,3978440,3978440,3,0,akrymski,,,"Saying Facebook advertising doesn't work is like saying display ads don't work.  Sure, the closer you are to the transaction the more value you provide:<p>- Facebook: CPM - bill boards : consumer in the position to buy, but not given it much thought<p>- Google: CPC - yellow pages : consumer in the position to buy and is actively looking<p>- Groupon: CPA - re-seller : consumer has decided what to buy and is purchasing<p>But whilst Groupon can provide more value, the pool of potential consumers it can reach is smaller.  Same with Google (informational queries only).  Facebook reaches the consumer in the very early stages of the purchase-funnel, before there is clear ""intent"".  Same as bill-boards, display ads will always have value - after all advertising is about making us want something we haven't already planned to buy, otherwise its wasted cash (think groupon vouchers sold to existing customers).  And whilst the conversation rate (clicks) on Facebook ads will naturally be lower, there are many more customers at the pre-intent stage (everyone in the world).<p>Sure a display ad for a Ford may not have great immediate conversion rate (clicks).  What about a bill-board or a magazine ad?  Yet do they have no value?  If I would be considering purchasing a car within the next year, but not actively searching for one, then an image of some appealing product would actually get stuck in my head, and when I come to search for a car on some price comparison site - it just might be a Ford I saw a few weeks ago.<p>Each of these models have issues though:<p>- Groupon - a large number of buyers are already existing customers.  GroupOn is only necessary because there isn't a platform for merchants to issue their own vouchers.  If there was, they could advertise those vouchers on Facebook/Google and not pay groupon their brokering fee.<p>- Google - provide a free yellow-pages service.  Instead of an alphabetical listing they aim to provide the ""best"" results first, so the only way to make money is to display ads next to those results for companies that haven't made it to the top.  Why would anyone select those companies?  The only reason I can think of is if these companies offer temporary aggressive discounts like on Groupon.  If G displayed ""sponsored ads"" as banner ads so people wouldn't get fooled into thinking it's a result - would anyone still click on them?<p>- Facebook - unlike a magazine which has associated readership with a particular set of interests (eg car enthusiasts) - everyone is on Facebook.  A niche social network for car enthusiasts would get a better ROI for GM then blasting their cars at everyone in the world.  Need more single girls from NYC in the age group of 20-25 to join your dating site?  Facebook will probably deliver great ROI there cause it can target ads by all these attributes.<p>Facebook has to expand its targeting capabilities, and that means gathering more data: my interests, my income, estimated net worth, what car I drive, where I live, who I have my mobile contract with, etc.  If FB knows that I just graduated and got a job that pays enough to lease a Ford, and my commute time to work is over an hour - GM would probably get a decent ROI.  If I visit enough car-related websites with the ""Like"" button on there, Facebook should know I'm interested in cars.<p>As Facebook builds a more detailed profile of me - it will deliver ads that <i>predict</i> my purchase intent, and in theory, that's a great position to be in.<p>In practice, I think people prefer to ""pull"" ads rather than having them pushed at us.  The old broadcasting model of advertising was necessary when people couldn't poll the world for ""whats the best car in my price range"".  As more information becomes available, people won't need companies telling them which products to buy.  Think of Amazon - you don't purchase based on ads, but based on reviews and ratings from other people.  Humans have become much more connected and knowledgable when making purchasing decisions, so ads matter less and less.  I don't remember the last time I bought anything because of an ad, instead I read reviews left by other people.  The advertising-intermediary is no longer necessary, businesses simply need to create great products.  And Facebook is a great product - for sharing photos, keeping track of friends and killing some time.  I wish they'd concentrate on making that product better, and I'd happily pay $1 per month to use it.  Even at $1 per year - they would make as much as they currently do from 1 billion people.  What will make me leave Facebook is the ads in my newsfeed, not the 1 buck a month I'd have to pay.  My time is more valuable than $1 / hour, so if I decide to waste several hours on Facebook a week - then I can certainly afford to pay $1 / month.",1337168866

I know how to safely drive a car, for example, but I have no idea how it works under the hood (and frankly, I don't have the time or energy to learn this).<p>Coding really is a specialized job. For sure, some people would be better off learning it because it can be useful, but everyday people don't need to know how to code just like they don't need to know how a car works. All they need to know is how to drive safely, or use the computer securely.<p>And really, I don't get this whole ""learn to code, learn how your computer works"" idea. When I first learned ruby, I didn't magically gain an understanding of filesystems and networks and all those other things. My dad, on the other hand, who doesn't know how to code, in fact he didn't even know what a kernel was, can fix your computer up in a jiffy (hardware and software both, particularly windows). He's in fact still better than me at this, because he knows all the intimate little details of the windows UI and what each thing does, what each error probably means.<p>So the point is, you don't need to learn how to code to know how to use a computer well, and learning javascript won't really help you with that either. If all you want is to know how to protect your computer from the powers that be, don't learn to code; just listen to what the experts have to say on the subject.",1337168039

It works.

Berlin is cheaper, friendlier to business, friendlier to English and just friendlier in general on the street. The cheapness translates as a factor for employees (their home), and the international orientation of the city allows you to draw on a much broader potential labour force as tons more people from around Europe would consider a move to Berlin than to Paris.<p>I'd be fairly surprised if there was even a single metric on which Paris beats Berlin for anything business related, so unless you have a product specific to the French market or have a significant other in Paris who can't move it's Berlin every time.

I know most developers have opinions on this but I've never seen it gauged community wide. I really would like to know: what do hackers prefer to be called in the real world in the form of a title?<p>- Do you prefer something with the word ""engineer"" in it, such as Software Engineer?
- Do you prefer something with the word ""programmer"" in it, such as Solutions Programmer?
- Do you prefer something with the word ""developer"" in it, such as Web Developer?<p>Do you think all these words pretty much mean the same thing or are they very different to you? I feel like a ""Developer"" is not very prestigious and the way I've heard it being used in the real world makes me feel as though it undermines and undervalues what I do day in and day out. So I have always preferred ""Engineer"" over ""Programmer"" over ""Developer"" because I feel as though they are all essentially they same thing but I rank them on how good they sound.<p>I don't know, am I vain? What are your thoughts, I really want to know.",1337166409

And it also means it has access to all physical and virtual entities connected to you. The music you've played, the photos you've viewed, the videos you've watched, tracking all these things are possible today.""<p>In terms of friends' activities, Facebook only has access to what people voluntarily post to it. And in my experience, only a small percentage of my ""Facebook friends"" actually post regularly about their activities. Moreover, that number seems to be going down, as though my friends have been using Facebook less as the years go by. Whether that's just because these people are getting older, or whether Facebook usage really is decreasing across all users, I don't know.<p>Sure, Facebook can see and analyze which Facebook photos you've looked at, but why is this particularly interesting? It's just a bunch of people dancing at bars, or maybe a few family vacation shots, at least in my experience. For videos, most videos people watch are on Youtube, not Facebook. So +1 for Google in that case (although I also don't see how this fits into the master plan you are describing). And for music, well, Facebook doesn't see what music I listen to. I don't list it in my profile, nor do I use Spotify or another Facebook-connected music program. I suspect most others are the same, as I don't see much music related stuff in my news feed. I don't see this changing in the future (and I even suspect that Spotify has come to view mandatory Facebook authentication as a mistake).<p>""...they will be more integrated into the fabric of our lives than any other business I can imagine. More than banking, more than the utility companies, more than any retailers wet dream.""<p>This is ridiculous. Even if a majority of businesses were to use Facebook to authenticate and track users, they are under no obligation to send this data back to Facebook (and, through Facebook, to other companies--possibly competitors--also connected to Facebook). The best Facebook could hope to do is impose a fee for using their authentication, and since they aren't doing this now I doubt they would ever.<p>Businesses just won't accede to sharing their information back to Facebook to the extent you think they will. They have no reason to, and plenty of reasons not to. The only things they will share are items users have specifically authorized them to post into their feeds[1], and based on my Facebook experience, those things are relatively few and far between (almost all of my feed is just status updates expressing an opinion or thought, or picture uploads).<p>[1] with the possible exception of spammy ""social"" games, which seem to find ways to post things even if players didn't really want them to -- but such spammy updates will only further drive people away from Facebook in the long run",1337166300

Smaller images would be created from a large, lower quality download.<p>I thought about that as a solution as well. The issue though is that taking the half resolution portion of a progressive JPEG or PNG will result in significant aliasing.",1337166250

With a signature, all the liability is placed on the vendor for cardholder present transactions, whereas with chip & pin the liability is <i>supposed</i> to rest with the card issuer. The systems are set up so that if chip&pin transactions are not possible, they can fall back to signature authentication if the card settings permit it (and they all do, because to do otherwise would be a massive customer service failure).<p>So, if you're going to use this system, you will have to take the liability issues into account.<p>(The cynic within me suggests that even in the case where a fraudulent chip & pin transaction has occurred, merchant agreements probably do their utmost to shift liability to the vendor regardless though.)",1337166088

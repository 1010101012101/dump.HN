So long as you don't present yourself as an authority when you're clearly not, I don't see anything wrong with sharing your point of view. In fact, it is, among other things, a great way to learn - from the feedback of others who might read your points and explain why you're wrong.",1295542712

Really, though, that's not the problem.  Yeah, I buy equipment every month, but not that much equipment.  For a while I was having the accountant do that bookkeeping for me, and it worked okay (though that was a whole lot more expensive than a regular bookkeeper.  Accountants charge a lot more than bookkeepers.)    You are talking in the low tens of transactions a month, if you don't count my small customers, so accounting for my expenses and income from large customers can be done manually even using rather expensive labor.<p>But I have a rather large number of very small customers.    my median customer is probably close to $8 or $12 a month.  Considering that I've got to pay for power/hardware out of that,  really, if it requires /any/ human intervention for every monthly bill, even if that human bills me at bookkeeper rates rather than accountant rates,  I'll have to raise my prices, probably above that of the competition, which uses custom in-house billing software, as far as I can tell.",1295542632

Letwin, the author of Heath's BASIC, felt his turf was being violated and by the purveyor of an inferior product to boot. Bill Gates nonetheless prevailed, selling Heath his BASIC and FORTRAN for H-DOS, a proprietary operating system Letwin had developed for Heath. But Letwin had instinctively understood how to win the favor of William Henry Gates: Stand up to the guy. By the end of the year Gordon Letwin would come to work for Microsoft and begin work on a BASIC compiler.""<p>I read a similar anecdote about Steve Jobs at Next.

Their DVD selection is indeed very good, and in general I'm fairly happy with them.<p>My biggest gripe is the penny-pinching changes they recently made to their DVD-postage system.  A couple of years ago, if they sent you 2 or 3 DVDs at once, they'd always include spare envelopes so that you could post the DVDs back as soon as you'd watched them (thus getting your next DVDs faster).  But recently they stopped doing this, stating that their customers should use their own envelopes when they've run out.  It may have escaped their attention, but most homes do not have DVD-sized envelopes handy, or the desire to spend their relaxation time fiddling about with addresses and labels.<p>When I mentioned it to their support staff they reeled off some nonsense about environmental benefits.  Pffh.  They have no problem stuffing each and every envelope they send with useless advertising.  I call them out on sacrificing customer goodwill to skimp on postage costs.

MathZee is a mobile platform that teaches math through application. Our math games develop critical thinking skills while assessing a child’s performance in a non-intrusive manner. At the time of the application, MathZee was nothing more than an idea. We launched our first mobile game Piggy Math (<a href=""http://mathzee.com/piggy-math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathzee.com/piggy-math/</a>) on the Excelerate demo day (thanks to Apple's app approval team for the perfect timing :-).<p>We wanted to join Excelerate mainly for the guidance we could get from all the leading entrepreneurs in the midwest area. Some of the mentors of the program are Brad Keywell (Groupon/Lightbank), Blair Garrou (DFJ Mercury), Chuck Templeton (OpenTable), Kevin Efrusy (Accel Partners), Lon Chow (Apex Venture Partners), Mike Gaiss (Highland Capital Partners), Pete Wilkins (Sterling Partners). The program is led by Sam Yagan (OKCupid,Sparknotes) and Troy Henikoff (SurePayroll), who are both amazing entrepreneurs and have great connections in the midwest area. If you need their help, they are more than willing to work with you even on a daily basis.<p>Excelerate's program is similar to Techstars' as the focus is on getting more and more help from outside mentors and finding a mentor-match for the startups. The program is divided in three months -- meet 60-70 mentors in month 1, develop / polish product in month 2, prepare for investor pitch in month 3. The startups are also provided office space and legal help. But the most value comes from the daily improvements your startup makes through strategic and tactical advice you get from some of the best minds in the country. I strongly recommend this program.

Any decent philosophy teacher will present the historically popular responses and then let the class discuss and explore their own feelings on the subject. Nearly everybody goes to school with some kind of social and spiritual programming from their upbringing, and a few philosophy classes goes a long way in opening up your mind to the broader world. NO philosophy class should ever attempt to make you believe that one way of thinking is right or wrong, but instead should present all the ways of thinking so you are at least aware that they exist. Even knowing that such other schools of thought are out there makes you better able to communicate with and understand different people who think in a variety of ways throughout your life.",1295539583

You wouldn't think that CompSci and Philosophy would go good together, but I couldn't be happier with the results. Some of the classes even have direct correlation with how you should think as a programmer. You should ABSOLUTELY take a Logical Reasoning course.. unfortunately for most schools that is a 2 or 3 hundred level course so you may have to take some philosophy intro classes first.",1295539236

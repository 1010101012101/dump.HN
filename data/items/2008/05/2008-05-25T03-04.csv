199326,comment,199279,199279,0,0,asiyesema,,,"You actually seem to have stopped reading what Graham said right around ""Lies we tell kids"". You weren't lied to, and you don't lie to your kids; good for you. Graham also isn't advocate the lies. He's offering an explanation as to why.<p>You ignore (at least in this post) the millions who were not raised like you, and yet have strong relationships with their parents. You ignore parents who've actually had to answer some really difficult questions (""What's a prostitute?""). You ignore the fact that you can't correct all the lies and half-truths because you won't hear or see everything your child hears or sees.<p>Even the truth as one ""believes"" it comes with bias, which one might consider a lie. ""I believe in God, but some people don't believe he exists because they haven't had a personal experience of Him"" ... the truth, perhaps, but it conveys an unmistakable opinion; how does one's 8 year old truly infer ""God may or may not exist"" from that? Is that really ""truth"" if you nudge someone so perceptibly in the direction you want them to go?<p>It's quite convenient for you that they were right on all the things they taught you. Or were they?",1211687888

The combination of arrogance and ignorance displayed in that essay is a bit too much. I'd be a lot happier if he'd release another version of Arc than to peddle this drivel :(",1211687399

It's a hardball, but fits the bill as something that's hard to talk about.<p>If you determined that there were differences between races, and it was in the best interest of your children to discriminate against certain people, what would you tell them?  Would you ever tell them to discriminate against other races if that was truly in their best interest?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence</a>",1211686830

199312,comment,198732,198732,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I think it has to do with red tape surrounding the hiring process.  There's an essentially infinite number of traits a potential employer cannot ask about (like intelligence), but a degree isn't one of them.  So degrees matter because they are the only filter HR departments are allowed to use.",1211685121

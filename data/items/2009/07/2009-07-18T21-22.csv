Why would someone worry about that when they have a legitimate question that they want answered?  The only thing I use karma for is to decide if something is worth reading.  Chances are that if it has been voted up highly it's probably worth reading.",1247954295

Is Google purely benign? Hardly, yet ""don't be evil"" does express something real in their culture. Are Apple and their users members of a superior race? Hardly, yet they have produced superior designs.<p>Microsoft's problem is that their truly distinctive quality over the years -- their competitive ruthlessness -- doesn't lend itself to positive marketing. A campaign based on something like ""We screw people. Hey, it's just business."" isn't likely to win favor.

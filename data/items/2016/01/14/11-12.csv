RMS calls this evil. Again: I prefer open source to anything but the rights are the creators to hand out and the customers to accept or not, that is freedom.<p>Buy a different Tractor or try to negotiate a deal before you buy a tractor.

With full car automation you remove the necessity for car ownership and parking, this means you can easily get automated transport to a hub, then use public transport from there. That&#x27;s especially the case for intra-urban transport, even in cities with good intra-urban public transport there is very limited capacity and convenience to leave your car on the outskirt and jump on light rail or metro if you come from the suburbs or from a neighbouring city. Automated cars fix this, you just leave the car and it goes do something else, the other way around you can notify the system that you&#x27;ll need a car when your traincar reaches whichever station, and it can wait you there.",1452772362

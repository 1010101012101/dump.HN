There seems to also be such a massive disconnect between other media voices over what the impact of revelations like this are to the overall global warming / climate change thesis.<p>There has been a stunning lack of intellectual curiosity/skepticism by journalists on the issue and if anything, much of the media seems outright hostile to the possibility that the overriding thesis could possibly be wrong.<p>This wouldn't be such a big issue if it weren't for the policy recommendations that would have us greatly change our way of life by people who by and large are insulated from proving their work has intrinsic value/subject to markets/or even the costs if they're wrong.

It's cute and fun I agree. But it's not really practical as an image manipulation program. It's a cute distraction for hobbyists. If you want to do real work then fire up your compiler.<p>Using the browser and trying to get html to do something which is easy to do with a compiler is a distraction. The internet is the powerful thing, forget about the browser and html 5, but use the internet and web standards to enable your software to use web based data stores for collabaration and publishing then you're onto a winner.<p>...oh and this doesn't run on 99% of machines either :-)",1265523930

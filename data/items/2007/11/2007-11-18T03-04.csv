81107,comment,81074,81098,0,0,nickb,,,"Lubos Motl's a string theorist. String theory is not really a science anymore... it's approaching religion: it's not falsifiable and you can ""prove"" anything using string theory... literally anything you want. I wouldn't trust his review of any opposing theory. You're better off reading what Lee Smolin or Peter Woit have to say. At least they're objective.",1195357616

This alone makes their product more appealing and more interesting to journalists.

But if you're working long hours just to be competitive, then don't do it! Life is too short to treat it like some sort of war. Have fun while you're young.<p>Hacking can be a social activity too. Do you have any friends that are programmers that work on hobby programming? Maybe work alongside them.<p>But I really give props to you for dropping out of college; probably took a lot of balls. Where did you go to school?

You might be able to convert an existing microprocessor plant into a DNA microarray plant but i don't really know.<p>This is the one that I believe 23andme is purchasing in bulk -- or, at least it is the highest end microarray sold by the company 23andme gets their arrays from. <a href=""http://www.illumina.com/pagesnrn.ilmn?ID=70"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.illumina.com/pagesnrn.ilmn?ID=70</a>",1195357217

81101,comment,81052,81052,0,0,matth,,,"All pretty good advice. However, if you find yourself out with friends and almost all you do is think about your project, work on your project. My girlfriend was dragging me out to parties, weddings, her family's house, etc. All I did was think about my project.<p>We've since separated. Things are working out far better now for my programming schedule. Unfortunately, no more sex.<p>Socialize, but not for the sake of it. Also, some people are for the late nights, some aren't. Just remember to keep tabs on your health. And I mean that more in the mental sense.",1195355882

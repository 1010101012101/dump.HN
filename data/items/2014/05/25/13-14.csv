You can&#x27;t just code up a diamond business overnight.<p>Since the fixed costs and barriers to entry are so high, you would take on a ton of debt or issue shares just to get to this point. Your creditors and investors would demand that you start turning a profit. So you would have to sell at market price or higher.<p>Then you need to look at other barriers to dumping your product: Do any of the buyers have contracts with DeBeers that lock them in for the near term? Are there legal restrictions or trade agreements to prohibit you from dumping? Does DeBeers offer additional services or terms that keep merchants locked in beyond the price? etc...<p>Then, of course, you need to sustain the low prices long enough to drive DeBeers out of business, all while assuming DeBeers doesn&#x27;t just match your prices and drive you out first.<p>Things like this are not done on the front page of HN very often, if ever.",1401026354

7796301,comment,7793386,7794719,6,0,ericfranklin,,,"As a producer of synthetic diamonds (<a href=""http://d.neadiamonds.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d.neadiamonds.com</a>), I can say the production costs for jewelry-quality diamonds are not as low as people seem to think.  It is one thing producing brown/yellow diamond powder/grit for cutting tools, but is orders of magnitude more difficult growing a large single-crystal diamond colorless and clean enough to set into jewelry.<p>The capital equipment for HPHT and CVD are both still quite expensive.  It is possible to find some used BARS presses for reasonable prices, but you will be hard-pressed to make a large colorless diamond with one of those machines, even if you know the right &quot;recipe&quot; to use.  Gemesis has many of these BARS presses and they have only been able to produce orange yellows and to treat CVD material with them.<p>CVD does grow more crystals per machine cycle, but also has much higher labor, power and support costs than the latest generation of HPHT machines.  CVD diamonds also typically grow as a brownish or grayish color and have to be HPHT-treated (different process than HPHT-growing, but can be done in the same machines) at additional cost to whiten them, healing defects in the crystal lattice.<p>The cost to grow a rough white diamond is generally comparable with the cost to mine one from the ground.  From there, the cutting, grading, logistics and jewelry all cost essentially the same.<p>Lab-grown diamonds are a raw good, more similar to steel, than they are an assembled good, like a TV or laptop.  There will certainly be more improvements along the way, but diamond synthesis only occurs under certain conditions defined by nature.  Changing the crystalline structure of carbon is a bit more involved than heating up some filament for a 3D printer.",1401025392

But oh beware, that too many graduate, as if that would mean that the university is cheap and will loose it&#x27;s prestige. Professors tend to hate it, when too many pass their exams and often times help to let some % of the students fail on purpose, to keep up their &quot;prestige&quot;. If every single professor explained thinks like on Reddit&#x27;s ELI10 and used interactive media to underline the structure behind a problem, then almost everybody would pass.

Use different dictionaries\n   and you&#x27;ll get different statistics.\n\n   This program can generate every word in the dictionary, and a lot of\n   non-words.  It won&#x27;t generate a bunch of other non-words, call them the\n   unpronounceable ones, containing letter combinations found nowhere in\n   the dictionary.  My rough estimate is that if there are 10^6 words,\n   then there are about 10^9 pronounceables, out of a total population\n   of 10^11 8-character strings.  I base this on running the program a lot\n   and looking for real words in its output.. they are very rare, on the\n   order of one in a thousand.\n\n   ...\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not really in a position to properly figure this out... for a start, it&#x27;s commonly claimed that there are 1M words used in English however my local /usr/share/dict/words has only 100K entries (and a even lot of those seem redundant).<p>Assuming my gpw binary was &quot;trained&quot; on a 1M wordlist, and that my algorithm averages three 8-char strings per passphrase... and we take the comments at face-value, i.e. 10^9 possibilities per 8-char string generated.<p>I&#x27;m going to pretend I can competently use M<i>log2(N) to estimate that three such strings might make up 3</i>log2(10^9)=89 bits of entropy. Throw in a 0-9999 number, let&#x27;s pretend that&#x27;s worth 13-ish bits, let&#x27;s call it 100 bits?<p>I haven&#x27;t factored in the capitalizations yet, and I&#x27;m not sure how much the random placement of the numbers and the random lengths of each &quot;word&quot; are worth.<p>IANACG (I am not a crypto guy) but that seems like a huge number of bits and so this is likely completely wrong (I&#x27;d start with going back to trying to properly analyze how many combinations my gpw binary can actually produces in an n-char string - that 10^9 combinations from a 10^6 wordlist needs testing).",1401024783

My difficulty was this: if a company holds patents that it is not exploiting, all they&#x27;re doing is adding unneeded pressure on competitors who have to think twice about implementing something similar because you never know when the other guys might sue. On the other hand, it also seems unfair to force patents away from companies that, while having financial difficulties, would also actually <i>like</i> to exploit those patents and simply need some time to find additional income sources.<p>This would actually be a good idea: such companies <i>should</i> be required to either present a good schedule for how they intend to actively use the patents they hold, with the implementation of that schedule supervised by a third-party (maybe state?) representative. Companies that fail to implement their patents should be subject to limitations that discourage them from using the patents in an anti-competitive fashion, or simply for financial gains that do not result in any implementation.<p>There could be a ton of variations on this theme. For instance, companies could be required to pay a certain fee for each patent they hold, that decreases if the patent is actually implemented and <i>increases</i> (possibly to impractical amounts) for every year that it is <i>not</i> implemented. This way, companies would be discouraged from hoarding patents, while actively offering an incentive for implementing technology they claim to be patentable.",1401024314

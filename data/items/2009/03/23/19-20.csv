What's crucial for getting lucky this way is good usability of the site and a crew of volunteer moderators as the site develops. My best example of success in a Q and A site is College Confidential.<p><a href=""http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/</a><p>It isn't perfect, but it is chock full of information about the college admission process, and its online atmosphere of politeness and regard for other users' questions readily differentiates it from most other competitors running sites on the same subject. The site operator is pretty good at getting press notices and other free publicity, and quite good at search engine optimization, but mostly he's good at building a helpful and friendly online community.",1237838242

Get some more color and design going. It's hard to separate content visually etc.<p>2) As a side project it looks cool but I don't see the startup potential. Where's the money going to come from? Ads on floor plans? Your click thrus will be low I fear.<p>3) How do you get more content? What's the motivation for me or for a conference center to get their floor plan on your site? I'm not sure it solves a problem that existed before. Was navigation of conferences and hotels that big of an issue?<p>Some ideas:\n1) Make mobile access possible a bigger selling point. If I can get to it from my iphone or blackberry etc then that makes it a bit more useful.<p>2) Find your way to draw in more content.<p>3) Find your line to profit. Is it a directory for conventions + this nifty layout and mapping utility? Do you rent a higher quality system for events willing to pay for it?<p>I'm not trying to cast dispersion and such, good luck on it :)",1237838175

The features of the site matter, but not nearly as much as the community. So, it is more of an anthropology and sociology problem than a build-a-webapp one.<p>For law and medicine, for instance, you'd have to fight the mindset of ""online is not reliable"".  In programming it is fairly easy to check if someone's answer is trustworthy because you can go and test it yourself relatively quickly and unambiguously. In other fields establishing the credibility of someone answering a question is a lot more tricky.  That said, I think bar associations have (bad) sites to ask each other questions.<p>I agree with Jeff that you can't make a general site of this sort without an intense amount of moderation.

However, one dangerous thing I think communicated here is, and I paraphrase, ""just put an ad on adwords to a page describing something and see if you get click troughs or signups"".<p>Jason Fried at 37signals has spoken a few times on how little business they got from adwords (might still be the case).  I remember comments from him 2+ years ago, that their adwords account was just kind of forgotten about.<p>Since a very tiny minority of their customers ever come from adwords now, I wonder how much smaller that would be if it was just a signup form and a few bullets of what Basecamp was going to be.<p>The point is, if Jason Fried had created Google adwords ads 3-4 years ago about what Basecamp was going to be before they started even putting a couple weeks into it, it sounds like he would have had a false negative.<p>Don't get me wrong though.  I'm pointing to more about the problem with relying on adwords than the overall philosophy of the method.<p>Afterall, 37signals uses their blog to do this technique instead of adwords.  They would leak out stuff about CRM and Sunrise many months before they ever finally had Highrise out for sale.  I'm sure they got tons of great feedback on their blog and people clamoring for ""yes give me simple crm!"" as a strong positive signal that they were on the right path of a lucrative product.<p>So yes, get the minimum done and start testing on it.  Just don't solely rely on taking a Google Adwords ad out though.<p>I recently was on a panel at the University of Illinois talking about entrepreneurship and Inkling.  I was with Keith Schacht, one of the original founders of Inventables, and now he's doing craftedfun.com.  He 's also religious about testing early concepts.  I love a story he had about how he had an idea about some kind of mobile application the employees at a bar would use.<p>So right then and there he drew some stuff on paper, then went to 3 local bars near his house and asked to talk with a manager.  He then bugged them each for a few minutes about his drawings on paper.  And from those conversations he decided not to execute on those ideas.  Sure this took balls, and he's crazy like that :)<p>But we all could be doing this more. And probably know someone who we could probably be bugging about something we drew on paper who could reasonably be a future customer, before we commit too much of our precious time on code and marketing.",1237836364

529045,comment,527873,528293,0,0,azanar,,,"Ok, I will. The value of restaurants is fleeting.<p>Here's why: The value derived from an individual from a restaurant is food, and perhaps being in a pleasing ambient environment for a short while. They derive value from the environment only while they are there, and from the food for the next day or so. After that, no more value unless you think he might have died otherwise, in which case he gained long term value in still being alive.<p>The deal with restaurants is that they continuously deliver short term value to a stream of people who, hopefully, come back again and again. The value of an individual meal is fleeting, but they're willing to provide that value again and again.<p>My point is not to confuse a steady stream of short term value with a discrete instance of long-term value. I can use a well-built chainsaw for far longer than I can use a New York strip steak from a high class restaurant.

But he is Richard Stallman. Also, you are sort of making a whiny ""wah wah let's get rid of this open source hogwash cuz I want my money wah wah wah -- but don't think I am against open source"" argument.<p>FSF has a particular agenda, an agenda most of us here should at least understand. This javascript stuff does pose potential problems for complete free software types from following their principles and using the Web. It makes it difficult. So Stallman is proposing a means by which one can know if a JS is GPL. Fine. I had been wondering for a couple years now why I hadn't heard much about this issue.<p>If this is what put you over the edge about Stallman, then you just haven't been paying much attention.",1237835423

529026,comment,528942,528983,0,0,azanar,,,"It is not so much money itself, as money combined with hyperbolic discounting -- some money now is much better than a lot more money later. Sometimes this is a valid decision; if you are going to starve tomorrow, a couple of dollars today is likely far more valuable than twenty thousand dollars next year. After that point, it is a matter of degrees; how much short-term constriction of lifestyle would you be willing to accept for the sake of longer-term reward, or how much long-term pain would you be willing to tolerate for a short-term lifestyle boost? A number of biases and beliefs come into play at this point including: whether you think yourself, or any of us, will be around for the long-term; whether you think that creating a prosperous image for yourself in the short-term will increase your long-term prosperity by playing other peoples' biases about image; whether you think you can gain enough in a short enough time-frame by taking shortcuts and being destructive than the ramifications of your actions will manifest <i>after</i> you get rich, and will manifest in low enough severity that get to stay rich.<p>The commonality between this and the financial catastrophe is that these people doubled-down on the short-term. In the financial world, they played hot potato with ticking financial ""assets"". In the bee-keeping world, they deferred basic hive maintenance as long as was possible and still have bees to keep. Some people get rich, some people -- sometimes a lot -- get hosed, and there is a lot of collateral damage. You might argue it is an unethical as all hell, but ethics doesn't enter into it. I get the feeling these people were going to be unethical however we measured productivity; give them a metric and they'll game it for their own ends.",1237835295

Possible causes might be (civil) war, epidemic, or space weather ( http://alturl.com/eo5 ).  Technology and knowledge aren't going to disappear, but the power grid is broken, materials and supplies aren't getting distributed, the Internet and wired telecommunication are gone (at least on a global scale), and governance has probably heavily suffered.

Having sat in long, single lane stop and go traffic I can anecdotally suggest it's irrelevant.<p>More importantly, there is a big difference between personal locomotion and commanding a vehicle. For example, the difference between my walking pace and that of an Olympic champion sprinter is not THAT great.  However, the difference between my freeway merge speed and that of my mom is an order of magnitude.  Add in fixed and inflexible travel lanes, the ability to speed up and slow down consciously and unconsciously, traveling at speeds that will knowingly cause death in the event of a problem, etc. and you have a lot more variance with higher stakes to the participants.<p>I'm not saying it isn't a fascinating bit of trivia, but I think Tom Vanderbilt's book ""Traffic"" is apt to lead to more insight than this particular nugget of knowledge.",1237834815

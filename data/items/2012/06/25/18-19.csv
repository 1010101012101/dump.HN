There's only a bare handful of languages that have even taken a serious swing at it, like Clojure and lately D. I want more evidence before I call it.<p>Probably the most promising approach that might salvage conventional programming approaches is a process-based model like Erlang or Go, where each process is internally mutable (mostly unlike Erlang, though it does have the process dictionary), but strictly segmented such that one process can not mutate another's state. This hybrid approach might be viable, and while it's not exactly business-as-usual, it's not as far a trip as full-on IO isolation. (Still, that affords just slamming everything in one process, at which point you don't win much. Will be interesting to watch Go's ecosystem develop and see if goroutines manage to become something deeply and pervasively used in all libraries or a thing occasionally used when the situation is desparate.)",1340650088

4157965,comment,4156896,4157810,10,0,robomartin,,,"I don't see the super-thin air-gap as an issue. In fact, it is probably an asset.  As an example, when we build the 1500W LED array we used a very thin insulating film to transfer heat from the LEDs to an aluminum clad circuit board.  If you have surface area (the stationary disk in their case) a thin gap can be surprisingly efficient at transferring heat from one element to the other.  Ad to this breaking up the boundary layer within that gap and now air becomes a ""better"" conductor.<p>There is no difference between spinning the heatsink and moving air at the same velocity across stationary heatsink fins.  It's about molecules of air at a lower temperature going across a surface with at a higher temperature.  N molecules per unit time ""absorb"" some of the heat and come of of the process at a higher temperature.  The surface temperature drops by a similar amount.<p>What kills you in both cases is a very thin boundary layer of air that sticks to the surface and has a velocity profile that goes from zero at the surface to whatever the air velocity might be.  This boundary layer isn't good for heat transfer from the surface to the moving air molecules, which takes a toll on the overall efficiency of the process.<p>There are techniques to help break-up the boundary layer in stationary fin heatsinks.  Some break-up airflow to introduce turbulence.  Others use raw velocity to break it up (air impingement cooling).<p>I don't know how well the rotating aluminum impeller breaks-up the boundary layer surrounding the fins.  It won't eliminate it completely but it certainly could be much improved from the case of stationary fins with low-speed air going across them.  If you had a heatsink with stationary fins and air moving at the same speed as in the case of the rotating impeller (by using fans, of course) you'd probably get similar boundary layer effects.<p>What I learned is that there really is very little magic in heat transfer.  I have seen some really wacky ideas brought to market that always seem interesting but have never proven to beat the simple solutions.  Funny enough, other than materials, most of the focus is always around dealing with the boundary layer, an issue that disappears (in terms of its significance) once you move into fluid-based cooling.<p>Caveat:  I have not studied rotating aluminum impeller/heat-sinks, so I could very well be missing something that I simply don't know.  My opinions are based on thousands of hours of research and FEA work in looking for solutions for the aforementioned project.",1340649684

4157956,comment,4157727,4157915,2,0,zainny,,,"The reason I still have trouble understanding a $B acquisition even in spite of these numbers, is that the tech market is so slippery and fast moving. It is a hotbed of continual disruption and I don't see that stopping any time soon. An investment of > $1B is not paid off overnight, but rather takes a great many many years. Will Yammer still be relevant and providing a competitive advantage for Microsoft ten years from now? Will Microsoft in ten years from now even look anything like the Microsoft we know today?<p>For example, one world I'm somewhat familiar with is financial planning businesses. In selling a financial planning business, you'll give it a back of the envelope pricing of several multiples (say 2x - 5x) of the amount of revenue the business is generating/expected to generate annually. That way, the buyer says to himself ""Well, I make the big investment now and then I reach breaking-even point 3 years down the road"" and from there it's all profit. 2x - 5x is a reasonable valuation, because both the buyer/seller can reasonably expect the business fundamentals to remain solid for that period of time. If the seller feels the business may be solid for longer, then he may push for a higher multiple. Conversely, a lower multiple may be justified in the opposite situation.<p>Back to fundamentals, dollars to donuts, a valuation north of $1B for a company earning a fraction of that in revenue is to me making the statement ""We expect the fundamentals of this business to remain solid practically forever"" or ""We expect this company to accelerate from zero to infinity"" - because you would literally need it to in order to recoup your out of pocket *<p>In the tech industry, that just seems a laughable proposition.<p>* Of course, there are many other considerations (people value, etc.) but at its core the dollars have to add up or you're just upping the ante on the bubble.",1340649544

Of course, through reverse engineering and through some code that Microsoft published, the interoperability of Mono with .pdb has improved lately, but it's still painful.<p>(3) there are many tools available for the JVM that complement compiler authors, tools like ObjectWeb's ASM, which have poor substitutes for .NET. And if you want a good parser generator, there are plenty to choose from for Java, while for .NET the only reasonable choice being Antlr, which is primarily a Java tool that also supports .NET -- on the other hand if you wanted to express your grammar with PEGs I personally couldn't find an option for .NET, while there are several available for the JVM.<p>(4) the features in .NET that are not used in C# have received poor support. For instance <i>tail calls</i> were NOT guaranteed to be eliminated, even if you specified this behavior in the compiled bytecode. But more than this, tail-calls have severe overhead over plain method calls. And did I mention that tail-call optimizations, as produced by the F# compiler, simply won't work reliably on Mono?<p>On value types, this is not such a huge issue as many people think. In Scala there's the proposal SIP 15 (value classes) which are implemented in the latest Scala 2.10 milestone release. This will open the door to much needed primitives, like unsigned ints: <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/value-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/pending/value-classes.html</a><p>Also, you're making a mistake if you think the CLR type system doesn't have flaws. For instance the CLR lacks a Union type, which makes it a bitch to implement lazy languages, such as Haskell.<p>The CLR also lacks anything that would aid in implementing continuation-passing-style. The JVM doesn't have anything for it either, however for the JVM exceptions can be used for unwinding the call-stack efficiently and compared with the CLR, exceptions on the JVM are very, very cheap.<p>This coupled with bytecode manipulation and library authors have been able to build libraries that make use of CPS efficiently.<p>(5) P/Invoke is basically JNA ... <a href=""https://github.com/twall/jna"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twall/jna</a><p>C# does make it easier because it has a couple of primitives that make the marshaling of data easier.",1340647628

4157707,comment,4156896,4156896,36,0,robomartin,,,"From the article: ""This centrifugal force is what gives the Sandia Cooler such massive efficiency, too.""<p>That is not correct.  The efficiency boost comes from the very efficient transfer of heat from the CPU to the spinning fan/heat exchanger by, effectively, using the very thin air-gap under the impeller.  The rotation of the impeller breaks the boundary layer in the airgap and you get good heat transfer across a very thin gap.<p>The airflow over the machined aluminum blades and, in general, the rotation of the entire impeller assembly, serve to keep the heat exchanger free from dust accumulation (which restricts heat flow).<p>Of course, as many have pointed out, it remains to be seen how easily this concept translates to a mass-manufactured low-cost solution in terms of performance and reliability under varying conditions.<p>I've done a ton of heat flow FEA work when working on various approaches to cool a custom high-power LED array (1,500W power-in).  We could get reasonable results with complex forced-air solutions and relatively expensive custom machined heatsinks as well as carefully modeled airflow controls.  In these cases the solutions were always very large (volume).<p>When we switched to fluid-based cooling things changed dramatically.  One of the design challenges was to maintain a narrow delta-T across the LED array.  This is because thermal uniformity was required in order to have uniform performance across the array.  The fluid solution, with some tricks, could easily achieve ten times better thermal uniformity than the air-cooled approach.  And, in addition to this, cool the entire array to a much lower final temperature.<p>A fluid cooling system was constructed using only a small fluid pump and no air-moving fans at all.  A passive natural convection radiator could easily handle the heat-load in a normal air-conditioned office environment.<p>While I have not looked at the specific case of cooling a CPU, based on my experience I have to say that far greater gains can be had by rapidly moving heat from the CPU surface using fluid-based cooling.  This, effectively, creates the opportunity for much greater surface extension than can reasonably be applied to the small surface area of a CPU.<p>Again, I have never studied CPU cooling, but I am not sure that this 150W cooling limit applies to fluid-based cooling.  I can see building a systems that can very easily move 150W, or even double that, using a relatively simple fluidic cooler.  At some level it is a matter of how many molecules of the fluid you can move across the CPU-side heat exchanger per unit time.  The answer to that is ""a lot"".<p>I can't see the Sandia or any other pure air-based cooling system used for CPU cooling at the extremes.  The assembly would have to be very precisely manufactured and lots of work would have to be done in order to ensure that vibrations and harmonics of the motor drive system itself don't cause damage to the circuit board.  If the system needs to have an impeller spinning at 2K RPM or more, lots of work needs to go into making it safe for servicing as a metal impeller like that can shred fingers in an instant.<p>Finally, there's the question of the mass of the spinning impeller.  In order to transfer heat into the impeller blades you are limited to certain geometry.  If the spinning base and/or the blades get too thin you simply won't be able to move the heat out no matter how well it can move from the stationary plate up to the revolving disk.  This is critical and it means that there are certain minimum geometry constraints that are likely to make the impeller somewhat massive.  From my FEA work on heat transfer I know that you can only go so thin on blades before they become useless past a few millimeters above the heatsink base-plate.  The same is the case here.<p>What I can see is the use of this concept to create a fluid based solution that uses a liquid to quickly move heat from a CPU to a much larger heat exchanger that uses the Sandia heatsink to move heat into the surrounding air, and, thereby, cool the CPU.  Even at that, I'd like to see data comparing conventional forced-air convection cooling of the external heat exchanger and even a comparison to a natural convection solution.",1340647487

Do not, under any circumstances, work for free.[1][2]<p>When clients agree to work with you, they risk more than money. They risk their time, their peace of mind, their ability to be proactive in a changing environment. The best clients are the ones who realize that. As such, they will be uncomfortable with the thought of your working for free, since the unsustainable nature of your position endangers their peace of mind. They're happy to throw money at you to protect what really matters to them.<p>In terms of practical advice, if you don't yet have a network, I recommend checking out oDesk, Elance, and other sites. Don't try to underbid providers working from developed countries, and don't spam every buyer with proposals. Just write personalized, specific letters containing some of the details you would be thinking about as you went about solving their problem. Before you know it, you will have more work than you can handle.<p>[1] I don't consider wedding videos, etc. made as a gift to fall under the category of freelance work. If this is what you do for a living, it's fine to gift your services, but trying to leverage free work into a sustainable career is an awful idea.<p>[2] The exception is support. Phone calls are free. Bids/proposals are free. Your work, the value you provide, is decidedly not.",1340647328

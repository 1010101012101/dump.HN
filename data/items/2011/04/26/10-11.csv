I've heard at that level and above you get better networking performance, which theoretically might improve EBS performance?<p>2) Related to #1, I wonder if you've tried doing RAID0 on the ephemeral drives? You get two with the large instance, and four with xlarge.<p>3) Did you ever measure non-IO network EBS performance during the tests? I've always wondered whether using EBS heavily would slow down other network traffic to the device given there is only one interface.<p>4) How often have you yourself experienced EBS volume failure in your RAID volumes?<p>5) When that happens, what happens to your volumes and instance? That is, what do you use to monitor when the RAID volume degrades? Does it usually take down the instance immediately or only after some time? If it just becomes really slow does that throw alarms or does the application just become really slow?<p>6) Finally, what is your current procedure for dealing with a volume failure?<p>Well that ended up being a lot of questions. I'd really appreciate any answers/insights your or anyone else could shed on these questions. I've been reading all these posts but it feels a bit like reading tea leaves.",1303815334

This way we get very objective comments, where upvotes are merely based on quality of comment. Too many times have I read ""Regardless what pg writes he will be upvoted"".  Of course, this applies to all known users. I think we are going too far with this censorship of upvotes.<p>I miss to see the upvotes from comments -- I am busy and cannot read the 100+ comments some submitions receive. Upvotes allowed me to see which comments were worth reading. Now I read only the first 5-10 comments that <i>look</i> good and then stop. I wish I could at least see something like: ""very upvoted"" instead of the upvote count for comments that receive more than 20 upvotes.<p>Since vote counts have been removed, I don't think I have distributed more that 3 upvotes. Somehow I fear that a comment was already highly upvoted and don't want to over-upvote it, so I just don't upvote.",1303812685

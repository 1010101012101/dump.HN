Also, sales do not equal profit.<p>I think Apple is hugely successful, both in terms of selling computers to individuals (Vast majority of Apple sales are above $1000, Apple has a 90% market share of retail PCs sold that are above 90% [1]) And they are hugely profitable [2].<p>1: <a href=""http://macdailynews.com/2010/02/01/apple_mac_owns_90_market_share_for_premium_pcs_costing_over_1000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macdailynews.com/2010/02/01/apple_mac_owns_90_market_...</a> )

There are many movies that become blockbusters to the great suprise of producers and vice versa, despite the many preview audience screenings, market research, etc. I don't know of any other industry that shares this characteristic.<p>With top-notch video camears as low as $2-3K now, I'm forever expecting a DIY movie explosion, which never happens. People explain this as ""it' difficult to shoot,edit, etc. a movie"" which is true but I think the much bigger factor is the stronghold these companies have on distribution.",1315666627

Primarily it's a way to organize your own collection of papers and access them from native or web apps on various devices. It also has some social features, like connecting users with similar interests and sharing tags on papers.<p>Its ""Computer and Information Science"" category [2] lists the papers with the most ""readers"" which I think in this case means ""Mendeley users who have added this paper to their collection"". Its most read paper in that category is the MapReduce paper [3]. Oddly, as I look at it now, I don't see a feature for rating or commenting on the paper, which could be a useful addition.<p>Of course, the authoritative method of rating papers is citations of other papers, right?

I'm feeling much better working for the company compared to the previous job where we had no sick days (I spent half my vacation days taking care of sick kids, or myself getting sick due to sick kids) despite the fact that the owner made a PERSONAL income of $2B from the company. I know that even if my kids get their usual winter time flus and colds, I still have actual vacation time left after taking time off to take care of them.",1315663834

Two examples from the UK, one now a little faded: Amstrad, which is just AMS Trading shortened, AMS being the initials of Lord Sugar, and Virgin, which one of Richard Branson's early employees suggested because none of them had a lot of experience of running a business.<p>Go for a walk and one might pop into your head.

2981578,comment,2981393,2981517,1,0,DougWebb,,,"I understand the appeal of using json, but it doesn't support hyperlinks. There really ought to be a hyperlink datatype as part of the json standard, with the same attributes that html supports: a label, href, rel, maybe more. The label is human-readable, and rel is machine-readable; both provide the semantic information that 
identifies what the link is for. The url is given by href, of course.<p>Not having this datatype is a big drawback of json for RESTful responses. That's why I typically design APIs to use xhtml responses instead. They're just as parsable (just a big bit slower) but they're richer and they allow the API to be tested with a browser that has no knowledge of the semantics of the API. I consider the ability to use the API using a generic client to be a good test of properly implementing HATEOAS.",1315663257

The set-up sounds like she was in on the plan, taking a stroll with her husband (without the child) so as to be the eye witness in the charade but I reckon they probably made a pact that if he was found out, they would protest her innocence and say he did it behind her back and swam below the frigid water until he reached another dock down stream out of sight.

And it's surely absurd to suggest that there isn't any critical thinking or creativity in the entire philosophical literature since Descartes.<p>> There is no progress in philosophy,<p>That's clearly false in some areas. To stick with the same example, our understanding of paradoxes has been greatly increased by the development of modern mathematical logic, which is largely the work of philosophers. To take another, we now have a much better understanding of the possible ways in which the mind might relate to the brain, thanks to the development of behaviorism, functionalism, etc. in the mid 20th century.<p>In some areas, such as moral philosophy, it's true that there has been no progress if you define progress as consensus. But so what? Would you rather no-one ever thought seriously about moral questions?

Your brain is processing millions of things in an out-of-order manner, and producing continuous motions in your hands and feet that guide the car so perfectly that few would be surprised to hear of someone driving for a lifetime without a major accident.<p>Same deal with many concurrent activities, like having a conversation, or playing sports, or listening to music, writing, thinking about the future, or fixing the fridge. In every case, we set our massively parallel architecture on many problems simultaneously, and then integrate a solution in real time without deadlocks or timeouts.<p>Humans have a corresponding weakness for sequential thought. We find it very hard to write a piece of sequential software that lasts more than a week without crashing hard or suffering from a major design flaw. We need to be taught for decades in the most advanced institutions to think sequentially and logically. Only the most elite of us ever manage to produce something that others would actually pay for, and even then we may solve a different problem for people than the one we set out to solve. (Think of startups like twitter that find that the market likes them, but for completely different reason than what they thought.)<p>Then we try to make people trained in sequential thought solve parallel problems, and they come up with steamy piles of tangled mess, full of deadlocks, races, and side-effects.<p>Our DEFAULT state is concurrent thought. We've all been trained to think otherwise, by our computers, languages, and education. We're hard on the poor folks who were carefully trained as sequentialists when they fail to make a parallel problem easy.<p>I work on a compiler for sequential source at a major corp by day, but my personal long-term goal is to create a compiler for a language that can form the kernel for a new school of thought separate from the sequentialists and their half-measures towards solving this problem.

Doesn't mean it can't be done, though, especially if you're really good with rocks and already have them lying around, whereas you'd have to go to the hardware store just to buy the framing hammer.<p>My point was not ""language X can't do project type Y,"" but rather that the things that put a language in the sweet spot for certain types of projects kind of inevitably pull it out of the sweet spot for other types of projects.  I.e. it really is always about trade-offs.  Sometimes the mere fact that you know how to use a given language is enough of a win to outweigh any potential benefits of switching to another language.",1250547502

Kiyosaki had a book ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad.""  In it, you basically found out that Kiyosaki was (a) lying his tits off or (b) a terrible investor.  You found out that he'd been bankrupt, and had run several companies into the ground.  That he invested in mining companies in Russia whose value would swing 50% up and down from day-to-day - but that this didn't bother him...  Wacko.<p>Yet, somehow, the book was a total phenomenon and made the guy huge amounts of money.",1250547479

By extremes I mean professors who try to micromanage and get a daily update and professors who do not care at all. In my group, we have a biweekly meeting for everyone to present what they did in 2 weeks time which makes all of us work hard but on our own terms.

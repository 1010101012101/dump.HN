It means getting a defense attorney off their game might very well lead to an incorrect conviction (think Serial, though obviously the circumstances there are more tied to the use of the cell phone records). I don&#x27;t think that technology is going to bring us easier convictions for a while yet (e.g. statistical analysis of evidence leading to inference ala Watson might be interesting).

10367554,comment,10366761,10367530,0,0,nicklaf,,,"The relevant passage in the source for this claim[1]:<p><i>Funding crime labs through court-assessed fees creates another channel for bias to enter crime lab analyses. In jurisdictions with this practice the crime lab receives a sum of money for each conviction of a given type. Ray Wickenheiser says, “Collection of court costs is the only stable source of funding for the Acadiana Crime Lab. $10 is received for each guilty plea or verdict from each speeding ticket, and $50 from each DWI (Driving While Impaired) and drug offense.”117 In Broward County, Florida, “Monies deposited in the Trust Fund are principally court costs assessed upon conviction of driving or boating under the influence ($50) or selling, manufacturing, delivery, or possession of a controlled substance ($100).”118<p>Several state statutory schemes require defendants to pay crime laboratory fees upon conviction. North Carolina General Statutes require, “[f]or the services of” the state or local crime lab, that judges in criminal cases assess a $600 fee to be charged “upon conviction” and remitted to the law enforcement agency containing the lab whenever that lab “performed DNA analysis of the crime, tests of bodily fluids of the defendant for the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, or analysis of any controlled substance possessed by the defendant or the defendant&#x27;s agent.”119 Illinois crime labs receive fees upon convictions for sex offenses, controlled substance offenses, and those involving driving under the influence.120 Mississippi statues require crime laboratory fees for various conviction types, including arson, aiding suicide, and driving while intoxicated.121 Similar provisions exist in Alabama, New Mexico, Kentucky, New Jersey, Virginia, and, until recently, Michigan.122<p>Other states have broadened the scope even further. Washington statutes require a $100 crime lab fee for any conviction that involves lab analysis.123 Kansas statutes require offenders “to pay a separate court cost of $400 for every individual offense if forensic science or laboratory services or forensic computer examination services are provided in connection with the investigation.”124 In addition to those already listed, the following states also require crime lab fees in connection with various conviction types: Arizona, California, Missouri, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.125<p>Glen Whitman and Roger Koppl point out that “the very choice to submit a suspect&#x27;s sample to the lab makes the lab more inclined (than it would be otherwise) to announce a match, indicating that the suspect is guilty.”126 The forensic scientist must evaluate ambiguous evidence, but give, generally, a binary judgment that the evidence does or does not match. Whitman and Koppl explain why the probabilities given in DNA testimony are not usually an exception to this binary nature of forensic-science testimony.127 In this situation, even the most rational scientist must choose what to say. The choice will usually be influenced by scientific analysis done in the crime lab. But if the evidence is ambiguous, as it often is, then two other factors matter even for perfectly rational forensic scientists. The scientist is more likely to inculpate the defendant (1) the higher the forensic scientist&#x27;s “prior” probability of guilt, which is the probability before the forensic evidence is examined, and (2) the weaker the scientist&#x27;s desire is to avoid convicting the innocent relative to her desire to convict the guilty.</i><p>So, the claim does appear to be true, at least in some states.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0731129X.2013.817070"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0731129X.2013.81...</a>",1444523671

A university would face outcry from academe and the publishing industry should it try to assert copyright ownership as Doctorow proposes.)<p>&quot;Until a couple decades ago, virtually every university in America had work-for-hire arrangements with their faculty. These faculty, therefore, didn&#x27;t hold the copyright they nominally assigned to the academic publishers over the past century.&quot;<p>Even if true, did the contract allow them, as agents of the university, to sign those copyrights over to another party?<p>It&#x27;s not like people 40 years ago were ignorant of copyright law, so I find it hard to believe this thesis is true.<p>EDIT: I did some background research and found this nice piece by Joy Blanchard in Innov High Educ (2010) 35:61-69, DOI 10.1007/s10755-009-9124-1, <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/7812029/The_Teacher_Exception_Under_the_Work_for_Hire_Doctrine_Safeguard_of_Academic_Freedom_or_Vehicle_for_Academic_Free_Enterprise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/7812029/The_Teacher_Exception_Under_...</a> . I quote from it:<p>> Before the 1976 amendments to the Copyright Act, courts were more reluctant to recognize any sort of claims universities or colleges would have as the employer. Such an example is provided by the case of Williams v. Weisser (1969), the most noted teacher exception case of the pre-1976 era. In this case a professor at UCLA sought and won an injunction against a note-taking company that reproduced and sold course packets, despite his objection. According to University policy at the time, which drew from California common law copyright, professors retained a property right to their lectures and class notes.(However, during trial a university administrator testified that it was customary that, if a manuscript was forecast to be profitable, the university and professor would enter into a publisher’s-type agreement in which the university would pay the professor commercial royalty rates.) In its ruling, the court could not find reason as to why a university would want to maintain ownership of professorial copyrights: “[s]uch retention would be useless except possibly for making a little profit from a publication and for making it difficult for the teacher to give the same lectures, should he change jobs” (Williams v. Weisser  1969, p. 734) ...<p>> However, after the Copyright Act was amended in 1976, the legal theory of a “teacher exception” and the question of who owns course materials have become increasingly muddled.  ...<p>> In Weinstein’s instance, the court distinguished between the requirement of academics to publish and any copyright claim the University had per the “requirement or duty” clause in its copyright policy. According to Easterbrook, the University “told Weinstein to publish the article, not to ask the University for permission to publish — permission that would have been essential if the University owned the copyright” (Weinstein v. University of Illinois 1987, p. 1095). The ruling also stated that faculty members have the authority, not the institution, to grant copyright to academic journals when submitting materials for publication. Easterbrook stated that faculty ownership of creative works had “been the academic tradition since copyright law began” (Weinstein v. University of Illinois 1987, p. 1094) and likened the dispute among co-authors to a contractual claim, to which the University had no legal standing ...<p>> As previously outlined, courts have yet to definitively recognize any teacher exception to copyright law. Though faculty members would decry its abolition or amendments to venerated academic tradition, there is a case from outside the realm of academe that, should it be applied literally to academic cases, strongly suggests that institutions could potentially prevail today in exerting copyright ownership over faculty writing and creations  ...<p>> Thus, the teacher exception remains vulnerable and unsettled law.<p>My guess is that if a university should try this, the outcry would be huge, from multiple sides. The most likely response would be a push for a copyright tweak such that the current dictum concerning the teacher exception would be made law.<p>Thus, I see no real up-side to a university taking up Doctorow&#x27;s proposal.<p>Plus, Doctorow&#x27;s &quot;How to get every academic paper ever published into an open-access repository&quot; seems to be wrong. It would only apply to papers from 1976 and beyond, as the teacher exception was more clear before that copyright change.",1444522673

It is an absolute abomination of a language.   It&#x27;s ONLY motivation was that doing non-ASCII characters was really difficult way-back-when.  That&#x27;s it.  And in creating J they absolutely butchered the very principles Iverson and others were vocal and passionate about promoting and teaching.<p>I learned APL about thirty years ago. Yes, we had computers thirty years ago.  I learned it from what I&#x27;ll call &quot;first generation APL&#x27;ers&quot;.  It&#x27;s like saying &quot;the first inner circle who started to dabble in Linux as soon as Linus made is public&quot;. The first disciples of Iverson, if you will.  So, I am two levels away from Iverson.  I met him multiple times at conferences, seminars and APL university meets.  Him and other APL pioneers like Ray Polivka, Sandra Pakin, James Brown, Adrian Smith and Paul Berry.  All of these people wrote books about APL and taught it.<p>Big deal, right?  Well, yeah.  Because I was in the room, a very small room, with maybe 200 people, if not 100, when this paper was presented by Iverson himself (in fact, I have a picture with him at the event):<p><a href=""http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pd...</a><p>Notation as a Tool of Thought was an incredible eye opening paradigm for me back then.  I sat there listening to this presentation that pulled together all had learned about APL during the prior year or two of using it.  And it was revelation.  Notation made the power of the APL concept that much more than the ideas of easy array manipulation.  It brought computational problem solving to a level of expression matching mathematical notation.  This was way ahead of it&#x27;s time and I felt privileged to be among the first generation of people using it.<p>Yet, there was a problem.  Machines of the time made it difficult to work with non-ASCII character sets.  We had to use specialized terminals (IBM and Tektronix made some).<p>When the IBM PC came out we had to literally burn a custom character set ROM for the graphics card and replace the line drawing characters with APL characters.  That was great, but it sure didn&#x27;t make for easily opening up APL to the masses.  You had to be very, very interested in APL to not only buy an expensive APL interpreter but also engage in swapping chips out of your computer.  The language was definitely ahead of it&#x27;s time.  In some cases you had to buy very specific hardware or it would not work.<p>As PC&#x27;s exploded and portables like the early Compaq&#x27;s came out it became more and more difficult to deal with the character set.<p>And so, I remember going to APL conferences where the concept of transliterating the language started to surface.  The idea being to use a set of ASCII characters to represent APL characters and, therefore, enable this franken-APL to be accessible without hardware mods to your computer.<p>This was incredibly short-sighted.  Many of us knew it was a matter of time before graphical display of symbols (like math and music notation) would be easy.<p>Eventually this evolved into J.  A notation that completely abandoned the paper that earned Iverson the ACM Turing Award.  It&#x27;s APL without perhaps the most powerful thing about APL.  It looks like a terminal shitting characters because it is operating at the wrong baud rate.  Iverson made a huge mistake with J and he abandoned EVERYTHING he was so right to champion years earlier.<p>If we are ever going to go in that direction again (I think we have to, in some form) we need to understand that notation, more than almost anything else, was the key.<p>Computational problem solving needs to evolve beyond a state where the best we can do is type English words into a text editor and into something that is far more expressive.  For that you need a notation, not an abomination like J.<p><rant off>",1444522109

I grew up in a mid-size town in Germany and all children went to school on their own starting from age 6.  We spent the whole day playing outside roaming the city and surrounding forests and our parents did not care at all.  It was completely normal.  A year ago I moved to California and my wife and I were shocked to see how paranoid American parents are.  We live in a perfectly calm and peaceful residential neighborhood but never see children play on the streets or in the park around the corner.  Some people do not even allow their children to play in the garden because of germs and &quot;dangerous&quot; animals and whatnot.",1444522003

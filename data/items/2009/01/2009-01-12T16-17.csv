</code></pre>
Just like computer science is the study of how to best analyze and manipulate information in large quantities, game design is the study of how to find, create, increase, manipulate, measure, or otherwise ""use"" the <i>fun</i> in a work. If there were a latin word for fun, game design would be served well by being renamed [that word]-ology. (As it stands, I've found ""ludology""--the study of play--used, but it doesn't quite capture the same meaning.)<p>It's important to make the distinction: <i>fun</i> doesn't only apply to games. A ludologist would be perfectly at home in UI design, for example, or education (and also obviously things like toy and amusement-park design.) You could hire a ""game designer"" for those positions right now, but people would look at you funny because the branding's wrong.<p>However, just as there's a difference between computer scientists and programmers, there's a difference between ludologists and the risen-through-the-ranks game designer that we see today, so it wouldn't be a perfect fit. The game designer may know some facts about how to make things fun, and have some theories as to why certain game design patterns <i>produce</i> fun, but they've been ""hard-won"" on the street; they've never formally studied it, mostly extracting it from their practice in other game-related disciplines (art, coding, level design, etc.) That kind of game designer is half-developer (or artist, or playtester, or what-have-you) working in a sort of cowboy fashion to advance the field.<p>Of course, ludology is in its absolute infancy (it's about 20 years <i>younger</i> than formal Computer Science) so it's still not even recognized as a separate discipline; thus, the only ones working on it are making their advances in the field, similar to the original computer programmers who had to be Computer Scientists, because no one had thought the thoughts they needed to think to base their work on.<p>As I said, I'm taking CS and English courses. Tack on a bit of psychology and sociology, some media history courses, and whatever it is that teaches game theory (economics? basically, ""fairness"" as it relates to fun), and you'd have a good starting program for the actual teaching of formal Ludology. I was always thinking about being a CS professor one day; I might have to change that plan a bit, and perhaps write up my own curriculum ;)",1231778924

If done well, this kind of high fidelity connection can allow the driver to directly experience the physics of slinging their car around a turn.  In this case the ""user"" has a very direct connection to those physics.  (There's an actual physical linkage!)  In many cases, an engineer can add something to this like power steering, but still maintain this high fidelity.<p>In lots of software, the connection is very indirect.  It's as if one were sitting on a hydraulic platform, watching rendered 3D models on screens, driving an actual car by remote control.  If this were implemented well, it might feel great, but if it were implemented badly, it would absolutely suck -- just like a lot of UIs do.  Heck, even something much simpler like badly implemented power steering can still suck.<p>In essence, there are often too many layers of abstraction in lots of software.  At each level, you can lose some fidelity, and the end result is discomfort for the user.  There is no ""physics"" involved, but there are often underlying models which are not represented with high fidelity.  (Relations are a prime example.)<p>(I was watching an account by an Israeli Mirage pilot who also flew the F-16s.

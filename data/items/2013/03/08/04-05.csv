Someone can have 30 years at a company and still be not loyal if their heart's not in it, they plan to jump ship, they take advantage of others, they embezzle, etc. Seniority is length of time employed at the company. Loyalty is investment in and contributions to the work community.<p>And that kind of loyalty makes a company a nice place to work, because what you have is a community of people who are invested in each other.",1362718749
5342148,comment,5341888,5342023,6,0,cosgroveb,,,"Hi Michael,<p>Braintree developer here. You're right that Braintree.js is based upon our end-to-end encryption library. While that's been out of beta for some time, it was strictly for encryption (that's literally the only thing it did).<p>In this iteration we've added some helper methods to the Braintree object that make it much easier, in our opinion, to encrypt your payment form. In the past, if you wanted to use our encryption library, you had to intercept the POST to your server with a custom onSubmit handler to encrypt the data. Now, it's as simple as giving the id of the form you wish to encrypt and substituting the ""name"" attribute on your form inputs with ""data-encrypted-name"".<p>Additionally, unlike our previous encryption library, we're now hosting the JavaScript in our datacenter using the same highly available infrastructure we built for our gateway. This makes it easier to get up and going when you're spiking out your integration.<p>Ultimately, we felt that these improvements justified re-branding the library, especially since we now recommend Braintree.js over Transparent Redirect. Transparent Redirect unfortunately made it kind of awkward if you wanted to do your own server-side validation on the form data or do anything with AJAX.",1362718712

This site offers free exercises to learn web security (an ISO with a vulnerable web application and a PDF with the course). I'd like to get revenue out of it to pay for all the time I spend building each exercise and maybe be able to spend more time on it. I enjoy doing it a lot and building each exercise can be super challenging but having some reward will help stay motivated.<p>I started as something similar to Peepcode in December 2011 and was charging around $12 per exercise but I made it free after 8 months during which I sold around 6 exercises (to 3 people). However, I don't want to go back to this after making it free. Being free makes it available to a lot of people and it's something I won't change now (I actually wish I had start with free exercises).<p>I offer commercial license to use the exercises to run training with not much success so far (even if it's pretty cheap $990). I have around 130 visitors/day on average and up to 4000 when an exercise is released (the average value is 2500). I tweeted about sponsoring but I didn't get any reply so far.<p>And now I'd like to see if HN has a better idea or what I'm doing wrong... or maybe it's just not something that can be done and I should just accept to do it for the fun of it.",1362718616

5342133,comment,5338576,5340442,5,0,agentS,,,"> Not sure how hard or efficient this would be (just using one process) as I haven't tried an app in this style in go, have only been playing with it so far. I would be really interested to see a Go server implementation that managed a bunch of goroutines to serve requests, are there any examples out there?<p>I'm slightly confused by this question, because that's what the standard library does. If you've ever used net/rpc, or net/http, then it spawns goroutines for each request (or connection, respectively).<p>If you meant to say spawn a bunch of _processes_ to serve requests, then no, I don't think anyone has done it. I don't think it makes a whole lot of sense for anyone to write code to do this in Go, tbh.<p>> redundancy in case a process does hang<p>If you're talking about deadlocks, then only the deadlocked goroutines will be blocked. The rest will make progress, just as if you had multiple processes.<p>> rolling restarts to switch out to a newer version of the code seamlessly by starting multiple processes to handle requests before killing the old one<p>You can do this with only 2 processes, old and new. You can spawn the new one, tell your LB to add the new to the pool, wait 30 seconds, remove old from pool, wait 60 seconds, kill old one. You don't need an LB, you could, of course, use an nginx frontend or something instead. There's also some neat ways to do nginx-style zero downtime restarts that I've never tried, but heard good things about.<p>> I suspect you'd hit some limits of the scheduler<p>AFAIK, limits of the scheduler tend to be hit when you increase GOMAXPROCS to something above 8. At this point, you'll spend a lot of your time in the runtime managing goroutines. My solution is just to run multiple processes with GOMAXPROCS=8 and point your LB at both of them. Again, you can just use nginx.<p>Feel free to experiment with the model you proposed, but this is relatively non-idiomatic, and the context-switching cost will start to mislead you as to Go's actual potential. The advantage, btw, that you get when you use the model I spoke of is that in memory caching, connection pooling, context switch time are all close to optimal, and you have fewer processes to monitor/restart/update.",1362718358
5342132,comment,5339852,5340236,6,0,sirclueless,,,"It's not the engine that needs to be reverse engineered. It's the balance and legitimacy. If you offload all the RNG and cause equipment to be controlled by a central entity, then it becomes both opaque and a single-point-of-failure. People know EVERYTHING about Diablo 2 drops, because you have the machine logic right there. Not true about, say, World of Warcraft, where people know a lot of macro statistics about drop rates and so on through crowd-sourced data gathering, but they don't know a lot of things, like boss pathing rules and event scripting.<p>Running a private server for a MMO has a ton of fundamental barriers. 1) Players don't get timely balance updates. 2) Players have no confidence that admins won't hack/give away items/cause crazy events etc. (Central point of authority = central point of corruption. Even if there don't happen to be any game-breakingly generous admins on a server, you can't signal that reliably to potential players.) 3) Servers may disappear. Since info is central, but private servers may fold under takedown notices, owners running out of money, technical problems, lack of other players, or anything else, players can't have trust that their time spent will have lasting rewards. Credibility is almost impossible to build.<p>Basically, by making games reliant on a central authority, you force the element of trust and credibility into the picture. Usually the only server with any credibility is the one run by the game company itself, since ideally you can trust that their actions will be in the best long-term interests of their game and audience. (EA in particular lost that trust a long time ago, I haven't bought a game of theirs in a LONG time. But Valve, or Blizzard, and even Ubisoft to a lesser extent still have that credibility.)",1362718273

Lawmakers create a policy meaning to spare regional banks/credit unions, but ultimately they get carried along because their 3rd party providers have to comply (core processors, Visa, etc.), which pass along those costs/rules inevitably to the smaller organization.<p>Pros: Capital would be lent more efficiently as region's know their markets/customers better. Generally better service. Possibly fewer loan losses due to knowing the local market better.<p>Cons: The largest drawback is that of security, as many regional banks/credit unions are amazingly insecure. Cost to the consumer would probably go up slightly in the form of higher loan rates and lower savings rates, but it could easily be argued large banks aren't distributing these savings anyway.<p>The most amazing piece I've seen was when TARP money was given to the banking industry with the goal of it being lent to consumers and businesses.

I'm moving out to Silicon Valley when I graduate this spring. Could I meet with you when I'm there and get your help?""

He even took me on a tour of the whole company and showed me the ""genomers"" (who I remember being mostly bearded men staring into space thoughtfully while listening to music on gigantic headphones--strikingly different from Artsy's genomers today). The whole time he never made me feel like I was imposing or wasting his time. It was amazing to meet someone so successful yet also so humble and genuinely interested in others.<p>Joe continued to stay involved and add value even after I moved to New York. A computer scientist himself, he even helped me think through the original (very simple) similarity algorithm for Artsy's own Art Genome Project and despite how busy he must have been, would always take the time to answer my emails or get on the phone.

5342024,comment,5341931,5341931,1,0,nawitus,,,"Typo in ""your would like to pay"".<p>I had a somewhat related idea: instead of referring friends, job seekers would apply to the job, and 'recruiters' would choose and bet for a candidate, placing a certain deposit down (if that candidate were to be chosen). The corporation would choose a candidate (possibly one with most 'investments'). If the candidate is hired after (for example) 60 days, the corporation would pay significant interest on the deposit. If the company didn't like the candidate and he was fired, a reduced deposit would be paid back.<p>Anyway, the point is to outsource hiring to a market and let the market find out how to select the best applicant.<p>If there's a difficult problem to be solved, you can always create a market for it.",1362715424

When facebook starts to mess with the wall by:<p>- hiding things (and charge to make them more visible, specifically after promising never to do so)<p>- adding ads<p>- filling it with game updates,<p>- businesses ""like this 4000 times and win a prize"" contests<p>- X liked on page A, so here maybe you'll like this page B<p>Is it really no wonder that people get fed up, bored, and start looking for something with the original feature that drove them to facebook in the first place.

I somehow doubt those get brought up in many of your real-life conversations either.  Ron Paul is just another internet meme -- one which happens to be infectious because hackers tend to agree with his views.",1194385988

I didn't mark ""Facebook could already be into our idea"" as a possible answer for ""what might go wrong (This is a test of imagination, not confidence.)"" in the application.<p>Well, the gates are open. Advertising based on information provided by users is a reality. Let's see if we can take a slice of that pie.",1194385317

76768,comment,76630,76630,0,0,sabat,,,"I disliked this piece for a different reason: his attitude. No successful company was ever built by someone thinking as negatively as this guy.<p>Sure, someone who thinks that if he creates a new facebook widget he'll retire -- that guy may need to hear this. But wait, does he? He'll figure out the problem with that soon enough.<p>The rest of us ... do we need some smug guy telling us that the Plenty of Fish guy was just really lucky? I've read the Plenty of Fish story, and it sounded like there was a lot more than luck involved -- and that luck was the smallest component. Oh, and I've worked at other startups and know people who are quite rich because of them. It didn't take them five years and only luck. It took the right idea at the right time, and in some cases, multiple tries.<p>No, successful, wealth-generating sites aren't born every day.<p>But it's more possible to create one than this guy seems to think.",1194384552

76763,comment,76630,76693,0,0,caveman82,,,"The article's fault is not that the message itself is overtly obvious, it's that it neglects the more important question of: Why there will always be a large number of entrepreneurs in spite of the low success rates of starting a business and the enormous amount of work, dedication, and ""luck"" required to be immensely successful.<p>But that would be opening up an economic/philosophical can of worms that is neither here nor there.    \n",1194383760

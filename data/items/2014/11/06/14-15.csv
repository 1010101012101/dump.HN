When you think of them that way, you&#x27;re putting them in a box and limiting them.<p>Instead consider them to be a team of people. As you said, each of them are at different stages in their career in programming. You need to understand this and sympathize with them and their code. This takes time and effort on your part to help lead the way.<p>You say that you review the commits now and then and find some of these issues, but do you bring them up? Do you show them how the code can look and read better?<p>If you do, make this a process and act as the person approving pull requests for the first several weeks. Then formalize this process and delegate this job to the next person who you feel writes high quality code.<p>Again a SHORT guide or book will not turn around the quality of your codebase and the team working on it. If you&#x27;re interested in better code, invest in your team. Send them to conferences, give them a budget to spend on books, have book clubs and lunch and learns.

People often talk about talent pool and access to capital as being the main advantages of being in the Valley.  These advantages exist to some degree, but are vastly overblown, and you will only be in a position to use them if you are already successful.<p>Further, even if you are funded and successful, moving to the Valley probably doesn&#x27;t make sense in your early stages (and for most, it will never make financial sense).  Most people would rather work remotely than go into your early-stage startup office in a bad part of town anyway.  The tools to make scattered teams very productive and cohesive have existed for a long time.  As far as access to capital, if you get funded by a major VC firm that wants you to move to the Valley, you&#x27;ll have millions of dollars with which to do it properly.<p>There are exactly zero legitimate reasons to move to the Valley in the initial stages of a startup, and many legitimate reasons not to.  In fact I would think that most investors would look at the irrationality of such a poor decision for the financial health of a company and decide against funding it.  It&#x27;s indicative of bad, emotional decision making. Being in the Valley doesn&#x27;t make your startup any more credible or valuable than it would be anywhere else.  Developing a great product that delivers value to customers is the only way to have a successful startup - regardless of where you start. Begin with that, then move wherever you want.",1415285718

I started off with a little USB development board with an Atmel SAM7 on it, and then moved to the PCB and a newer Atmel SAM3 (partly after discovering how cheap prototype PCBs are from ITEAD).<p>I initially wrote the algorithms in python, using pyserial to talk to the built-in bootloader the chips come with, through which you can manipulate registers and control the peripherals. This made writing and debugging the C much easier. The chip runs TNKernel, a little RTOS, which handles the radio and IMU processes (and soon GPS and barometer).<p>Control is currently simple proportional control based on the IMU output, but I may add integral and differential terms once I&#x27;m more comfortable flying it, to see if can improve stability.

(That&#x27;s often not a cheat, either; my modules tend to declare the set of errors as globally-exported variables, allowing you to use == to figure out which error you&#x27;re getting if you care. If your errors don&#x27;t take parameters that works fine.) And the error interface only has one method instead of three. Less boilerplate in the worst and the common cases, less compile time guarantees.<p>It is debatable whether passing errors through is a good idea in theory or in practice at scale (two separate questions there). So far it hasn&#x27;t bit me at all, though, and I&#x27;ve got a good idea of what I&#x27;m looking for for such &quot;bitings&quot;.<p>I find in practice there&#x27;s two types of errors: Errors I know how to do something about, and errors I don&#x27;t. In the first case, I can only be dealing with a certain restricted set of errors coming back and I must inevitably write special-purpose code for the given error, and in the second, I don&#x27;t much care about what it is so I often send it along untouched. I haven&#x27;t found anything that manages to split the difference yet. Even returning a wrapped error is rare in my application code, though it has its place in library code.<p>I&#x27;m also finding in my real code that the ratio turns out to be closer to 1:2 errors I can do something with/errors I can&#x27;t, which makes the explicit handling not matter so much. (My gut feeling is that if you find you are <i>always</i> just &quot;return err&quot;ering, and especially if you are doing it without thought, you&#x27;re writing code that is passing up on some robustness.)",1415283783

I tend to keep up with password security theories from here and there, its a sort of a passion of mine considering how integral they are to our lives now days.<p>I have just always thought the forced changes were unnecessary if the password was strong enough to begin with, and managed in a proper/secure way on the server end.  Because it doesnt matter if they password is one day, or 6 years old, the chances are that unless you are high priority, an attack on your password is a here and now event, not a prolonged attack (unless you are a direct target).  Even in the event of prolonged attacks, there should be other measures in place to mitigate that avenue of exploit.<p>My only beef with non forced has been that over time, I feel the tendency for that particular password to be reused on multiple accounts would increase, therefore weakening it.<p>Like all theories though, I like to keep any open mind to all outlooks, I am by no means an expert.

While it may promote laziness to some degree in coming up with a strong password, that issue can easily be overcome with policies on length, character types, etc... Forcing password changes on a routine schedule can be a very good security practice though.<p>As for storing old passwords I have split feelings personally on this. I hate it because I forget sometimes what passwords I have previously used. In my case it was a school and every semester we had to change our password. Since I was a part-time student taking 1-2 classes each semester including summers it meant in some years I would change my password 5-6 times. That meant remembering every password I had ever used. After 2-3 years this became a major headache to me. A better and IMO preferred implementation of this would be to prevent maybe the previous 2 passwords from being reused, but to say you can never use the same password twice regardless of time between uses is just dumb.<p>On your final note regarding the length issue. While I can&#x27;t speak for that particular system, it sounds like it may have something to do with some legacy system restriction they have in place that is forcing a constrained length (similar to some banks not allowing special characters in your password).",1415282753

I pointed out that the issue is not clear.<p>> Secondly, looking at it from this angle, the Von Hannover judgements of the ECHR provide a number of criteria for judging the lawfullness of publication.<p>You can&#x27;t only look at the ECHR, as the ECHR is not itself law and the national laws implementing it in each state subject to it differ greatly. The ECHR is relevant because it is the source of most of this legislation, but as long as the national laws implementing the principles are not in conflict with the ECHR, the can - and often does - add additional restrictions. Which is why I pointed out that the issue is not clear and that simply pointing to the license is insufficient.<p>As I pointed out, in the UK (which I used as an example only because I live here) it is clear that copyright is insufficient to control your right to publish. In fact, in addition to the Human Rights Act, the Data Protection Act and the Copyright, Design and Patents Act both add additional restrictions that may prevent or limit publication beyond copyright.  I don&#x27;t know the extent of legal restrictions in the rest of Europe.",1415282434

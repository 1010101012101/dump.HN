It didn't get through to me until I read it in a book about chess, actually. In the book the author warned that beginners get into trouble by paying attention to momentum. Instead, it suggested, it was better to look at the board each move as freshly as possible and ignore what happened to get it into that state because it was irrelevant.<p>More often than not, I think that's good advice for darned near everything. I'd say take a fresh look and weigh your options. If you didn't have a job right now is this the one you'd take? If not then stop! Because that's what you're doing every morning, you're taking this job for no better reason than you took it yesterday and the day before that.",1368741554

The lack of heel-support is a huge contributing factor to over-pronation and probably Plantar Fasciitis. If you're not wearing flip-flops, are you walking several miles with proper support shoes for that distance if you have a flat foot? Something like the Asics Kinsei or Kayano series.<p>I'm a runner and regularly walk/run several miles to work too. I have no arch in my foot, but this was a couple years before I ever got a standing desk. I developed serious foot pain one summer wearing flip-flops everywhere.<p>I also have a standing desk I've had for 2 years now. It's a Geek Desk, and has a motor that allows it to raise from sitting to standing. First couple months I definitely had some new aches and pains, but they eventually went away. Two years later, I don't have any pains now. I don't stand all day though, I alternate between sitting and standing, and I take breaks about every 25 minutes.<p>I wonder about your posture on your makeshift standing desk. If the desk wasn't at the correct height it could also cause problems.<p>Edit - Also I picked up one of these years ago and use it daily, helps a ton: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Medi-Dyne-ProStretch-Unilateral-Stretching-System/dp/B000GAAXGK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Medi-Dyne-ProStretch-Unilateral-Stretc...</a>",1368741543

Honestly I was rather confused also as the skepticism D-wave was met with at the beginning appears to have been replaced with a lot of hype without any mention of the actual physics of what's happening.<p>The position of most of the scientific community at the outset regarding D-Wave quantum computers was that it was uncertain what was going on at all. Nobody knew for sure if the D-Wave computers were really using quantum entanglement when they ran or not. Obviously a computer that does computations without doing at least some of the weird things allowed by quantum mechanics wouldn't be much of a quantum computer.<p>It appears that the D-Wave computers could indeed be taking advantage of entanglement. However since the D-Wave computers are not very isolated from their environment, the delicate effects they attempt to harness are sometimes disrupted when the computer interacts with its environment (aka decoherence to use the Quantum Mechanics term).<p>Overall it looks like D-Wave is making some progress on demonstrating their computer does really harness what's allowed by quantum mechanics. This is exciting, though ironically they have not caught up to their own overstated claims of what their machine does. Perhaps with more work they can better isolate their computer from it's environment and graduate from quantum annealing to reversible adiabatic quantum computing. Or maybe someone else working with some other physical system which has an intrinsically lower coupling to it's environment might beat them to it. An exciting time for the field nonetheless.<p>Getting a speed up on a particular class of problem could have a great deal of practical importance, but building a scalable computer that fully takes advantage of everything allowed by the laws of physics is the holy grail of quantum computing, and it doesn't look like D-Wave is there quite yet. Still an exciting time for the field nonetheless.",1368740344

Allow me to explain why, and I mean this as hopefully constructive criticism:<p>> What I can't stand is when people don't make the fucking effort to reach the right idea, but just fall back on rank. That will make me very angry.<p>Optimal decisions are rarely made by groups of people, which is part of the challenge of working with people. It's understandably upsetting, but if this bothers you so much, you should consider: (a) changing jobs if the person pulling rank is unreasonable, or (b) working out the power structure and on your relationships and communication to get your point across better.<p>>  They could have brought me into a few of the meetings so I'd see how the sausage is made, and maybe I'd realize some of the constraints they were under and see why my idea wouldn't work in that context.<p>It sounds like you were cut out of the decision-making process. Perhaps your superiors were genuinely unreasonable, in which case you should have done what everyone in an unreasonable work situation should do: switch teams, or switch jobs. Alternatively, if your real-world interactions convey as much arrogance and petulance as your online rants do, then you're maybe losing out because people don't find it productive to bring you into the decision-making process. Perhaps you're right, but perhaps the way you communicate turns people off. I'm just laying out some alternate possibilities, since your posts seem to convey that everyone was against you.<p>> I do, however, expect to be treated as an equal, and I'll raise hell if I'm not.<p>Perhaps you're not earning peoples' respect with this attitude. It sounds a bit like what my 5-year-old does when he thinks we're being unfair to him.<p>EDIT: You're obviously intelligent, but you have to realize that there are other intelligent people, and all things being equal, most people would rather work with someone who can communicate.",1368739485

The reason being that the answers are rather apparent in divulging the underlying categorization.  Given this, I am never quite sure whether I am answering honestly or in a way that will result in a personality that I would like.  Either way, I took a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test today and was categorized as INTJ.  Reading about it, I do think it is fairly accurate, though it obviously has some shortcomings in my opinion.  Most importantly, I do believe that I test differently given internal and external factors such as mood, season, etc.  I do not remember precisely, but when I took the test several years ago I believe I tested as INTP.  My research into both types seem to describe similar traits on the surface and probably as accurate of a categorization as this test will provide me.  However, I did find an interesting article describing the differences between the two types:  http://personalityjunkie.com/08/intj-vs-intp-type-differences/.  Coincidentally, when reading the INTJ part, I believed it to be a fair reflection of myself.  Then, while reading the INTP summary (and mistakenly thinking that was the result of my test), I concurred that I was ultimately an INTP personality.  So, even though the article seemed to clear up the differences between the two types, I still hesitate to identify under either strict category.  Instead, I think I will identify as INT/JP.<p>As a long-time reader but first time writer to HN, I was just wondering what the demographics of this community are within the MBTI spectrum.",1368739126

Memory layout can have a significant impact on how quickly the rest of the application runs, due to the effects of CPU cache, RAM, and virtual memory paging.</i><p><i>The only definitive measures of allocator performance are attained by measuring the execution time and memory usage of real applications. This poses challenges when qualifying the performance characteristics of allocators. Consider that an allocator might perform very poorly for certain allocation patterns, but if none of the benchmarked applications manifest any such patterns, then the allocator may appear to perform well, despite pathological performance for some work loads. This makes testing with a wide variety of applications important. It also motivates an approach to allocator design that minimizes the number and severity of degenerate edge cases.</i>",1368739097

This allows for a stronger welfare state, which reduces economic inequalities, thus resulting in a lower crime rate.<p>My intuition is that the stronger democratic nature of these cultures is due to racial <i>homogeneity</i>, rather than magical Scandinavian white sauce. There are cases in Africa where this can be seen (notion of ""it takes a village"" have generally come from African communities), but I honestly don't know enough about them to verify: have they scaled to an extent where they're comparable to the ultra-democratic bloc? Have they sufficiently negated the influences of Euro-American imperialism such that we can claim their democratic impulses are original rather than imposed?<p>The corollary to this is that most of the failures of American democracy can be traced back to the slave trade, from the Three-Fifths Compromise to the present day litany of anti-black sentiment. Irish and Italian immigrants did have problems, but they've been largely integrated into the American melting pot in the present day. Chinese people, such as myself, have had more trouble but have nonetheless integrated better than blacks did, possibly because our enslavement didn't have the same level of cultural momentum, possibly because of an imperialistic cultural history of our own; it's unclear to me.<p>The failures, thus, come from these struggles. These are struggles that, as far as I am aware, did not happen in Scandinavian history. They have humorous nationalistic jibes between each other, but they did not have the kind of wildly divisive events that led up to the Mason-Dixon line and the Reconstruction, which reinforced these divisions to the detriment of democratic institutions.<p>In other words, it's not actually that Scandinavians are better people. They're not more democratic because they're less racist. They're more democratic because there were no significant populations of brown people to oppress during their formative periods. Denmark is an interesting edge case, in that they participated in the Colonial Age, but nevertheless built strong democratic structures and were then enveloped in the firestorm over depictions of Mohammed. Or maybe that supports my intuition. Who can tell.<p>But that's how it is in political science; half of them seem ready to watch democracy deflate like a rubber ducky in the Hong Kong harbor.<p>Anyways, this was all off-topic, but I thought it was unfair to let an ad hominem stand.",1368738777

I spent $1000's on this, and my insurance companies spent even more on custom orthodics and docs.  Nothing worked, and it actually got worse over time.  I could barely walk some days, and traversing stairs backwards (this helped a little with the pain) was pretty common.<p>I assumed it was just due to a childhood injury on my left foot, and I'd just be suffering for life.  But when my right foot got the pain ( only after using all the medical remedies and prescribed devices ) - I knew something was off.<p>A few years ago I heard about the barefoot running trend.  On a whim I decided to try it (the barefoot part, not the running part, yet) and see what would happen - it would have been hard for things to get worse.<p>Fast forward to now - I have not had pain in years, lost weight (which also helped), and run 1/2 marathons and 5ks multiple times a year.<p>In my experience any arch support just helps lead to atrophy of the tendons, which cause the pain.<p>My remedy in a nutshell:<p>1.  Before you get out of bed each day (and BEFORE you put any weight on your feet) stretch both feet (even if only one is having a problem).  Grab your foot at the ball and pull back (gently, you're not trying to snap your foot).  Hold for 60 seconds.  repeat on each foot 2-3 times.  Over time you can dial this back, but keep at it for a few weeks and you will notice a difference.<p>2. Stay ""barefoot"" as much as possible.  Walk around the house barefoot, wear thin, flat shoes when possible (Nike Free, Vibram, Vivo, or any thin sole shoe without a big heel - normal sneakers suck)<p>3. Read Born to Run - it's a great book :-)<p>Hope this helps some.  I suffered for years, and it sucks.  Happy to answer questions.",1368738537

The majority of my day is spent sitting down -- sometimes at my computer and sometimes in meetings. That's what my job is like right now. If you're like me, when you get home from work you go right back to the computer like a moth to a lamp. Advice about moderation is completely lost on me because I'm a glutton for computing -- that's just my reality. To mitigate the amount of time I sit during the day, I built a standing desk and spent my evening hours using it. It was great -- my posture improved and the contrast from sitting is something my body really enjoyed. I stood barefoot on a rolled up Yoga mat thinking that it would be a sufficient cushion. My weight is ~150 lbs and I would not consider myself unfit -- I walk several miles a day to and from work. Nonetheless my feet became increasingly sore. At first I thought nothing of it because I've often had sore feet from activity and it's never been chronic. Gradually the pain increased and became persistent through my day. By the time I realized I had become afflicted by Plantar fasciitis it was too late. I immediately abandoned the standing desk but recovery has still been extremely slow. The injury isn't massively painful but it can take _multiple_ years to heal in bad cases. Mostly the pain is a constant reminder that I am a moth.<p>Use my cautionary tale however you see fit, but remember that the lesson boils down to one real truth: there is no way to avoid the health hazards associated with excess computing.",1368738505

I try to stand about half the day with the mat, and sit the other half. About 4 hours each, intermittently. Feels pretty good so far after about a month.",1368738180

Unfourtuantly, the written material on it is still mostly in the research paper format, which is very rarely usefull for mortals. However, many lectures on the subject are pretty approachable. I used to have a collection of links to Perimeter Institute videos, but they seem to have 404`ed, and I don't have the time to dig up the new urls.<p>If you are just looking for the theoretical basics , this youtube series [1] is a good place to start.<p>While I do find these videos approachable, they are fairly math heavy. Most of the lectures I've seen explain things at a level that almost anyone can get something out of, and you don't miss out if you skip over the stuff that is beyond you.<p>For most of the talks, the math involved is only algebra and vectors. Although, the vectors are represented using bra-ket notation which may throw you off.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/mnielsencourses?feature=watch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/mnielsencourses?feature=watch</a>",1368738049

Most people for example eschew a police state where all your movements are tracked by video at all times and may be used to prosecute (or blackmail) you. Google Glass plays an important part in the creation of just such a state. You need to look at the recent U.S. Justice Department statement which essentially states that anything stored online is subject to search without warrant. Google + U.S. Department of Justice, bringing totalitarianism to a state near you!",1368738034

5721111,comment,5711232,5717235,2,0,danbruc,,,"IMHO - and I may of course be wrong - there are (widely) accepted definitions for concurrency and parallelism in the computer science community and in my comment I tried to present them as good as I could (but the comment is far from being flawless). Assuming I am correct with the previous sentence, there is no way of interpreting concurrency and parallelism this way or another because the terms are fixed by their definition. You can of course look at their relationship from different angels and highlight or ignore different aspects in different situations but this does not change their basic relationship or even definition.<p>I can think of two reasons why one would call a language parallel but no concurrent. First this could obviously happen because somebody is not aware of the meaning of the concepts or uses the words in a non-standard way but I think this is probably not the case - I would be surprised if one designs a concurrent/parallel language and does not know the distinction.<p>My best guess is that the intended meaning of the statement is, that the language is no good for general concurrent task but well suited for SIMD-like concurrent tasks, that is running the some operations on multiple different inputs in parallel. (I have to admit that I know nothing about Sawzall and did not invest any time to figure this out, just guessing.)",1368738023

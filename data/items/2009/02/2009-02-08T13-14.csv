If someone suggests that all children should be killed, or that debt should be added to the State I live in that presumably my children would have to pay off, I might react to these statements with more than disinterest and perhaps even with anger, since they conflict with my identity as a father.<p>'Open mindedness' may be a help navigating some problems regarding differing identities, but certainly not all.",1234101098

I prefer reading on the computer anymore.  I didn't like how there wasn't a good way to hold it with out accidentally flipping the pages.  This new version seems to have fixed that.  I was willing to accept the non-color display, but I didn't like the liquid paper.  I wish it was backlit.  The navigation was terrible.  It looks like they've tried to address the navigation with a joystick, I'm sure it's better than the original.<p>I guess I wish I had an something like an iPhone or iPod touch that was around the same size the Kindle, that had a color screen, the touch features of the iPhone and iPod touch would be great, but button and stylus navigation would be alright.  Nice looking anti-aliased fonts are essential.  A good way to get content.  Kindle has a nice tie in to Amazon, but the on the original it was such a bother to get other content on it.  The big problem was no pdf support.<p>I'm excited that the Kindle 2 is much improved, I hope they have a lot of success with it.",1234101028

472150,comment,471660,471885,0,0,lisp_padawan,,,"Kierkegaard had some interesting views on this very subject, that a belief system such as Christianity <i>requires</i> a greater life involvement than the common 'Sunday Christianity' of 30 years ago. I think now we find a larger number of 'genuine believers' whereas 30 or more years ago people went to Church because that was the thing you do. Now, as people have a greater freedom to NOT go, so the remaining attendees probably become <i>more</i> devoted. A kind of evolutionary process, where the selection method is self-selection of attendance based upon initial belief.<p>As a rationalist/atheist/<i>whateverlabel</i> of course I'm not sure I'm altogether comfortable with the rapid increase in religious adherence in recent years but that's a different discussion.<p>Very interesting essay PG!",1234100414

472144,comment,471576,471576,0,0,ekpyrotic,,,"Great read; however, I feel Prof. MacKay misses an important point. Employers fuel the problem, demanding this-and-that. People are going to university to meet the criteria for an top paying job, rather than passion for the subject. This is what is causing the grade struggle: student rush, cram, and rote memorise to achieve desired grades; most don't give a damn about interacting with the material. If you said here's an 'A' they'd take it, and not care about not knowing the material.<p>First, we need to restore university as an institution of learning [instead of a qualification mill]. In fact, I might be inclined to argue that grades should be abolished outright - almost what Prof. MacKay is saying.<p>[disclaimer: I'm a student at a world renowned British university]",1234099628

472139,comment,471660,472025,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I look at politics and religion as deeply personal choices. I also think they are somewhat ""beyond reason"" -- I don't want to use the term irrational because my point is that the rules of rationality don't apply. Perhaps trans-rational? And when I mean religion, I include the atheists here. They're as impervious to reason as any of the others, but mostly can't see it, which makes them a bit humorous to deal with.<p>The problem is that most folks are 1) very uncomfortable with this situation, and 2) can't find the words to express the ""why"" of what they are saying (except for the rationalists, who will use reason ad infinitum regardless of which side of the issue they stand)<p>I think the most honest responses are, like yours, where you say that there's good reasons that you just can't get to. I also respect people who say ""beats me"" -- the agnostics. I'm more of an agnostic these days when it comes to religion, and for a long time I've realized that politics is completely non-rational.<p>That's not to say you can't use logic and reason in the discussion: I think they provide tools to meet in the middle and share equally. But logic in these discussions has a completely different purpose than it does in say, a geometric proof. It's a flashlight in a dark, constantly changing room. It's not the light switch. Most people miss that point.<p>I enjoy seeing people talk about religion and politics (as long as it's civil) because it gives me an idea of how they think. It's neat to watch people struggle with really tough questions. Who knows? There might be something I could learn there. But I can see where it can destroy a forum.",1234099230

472136,story,,,5,6,ideamonk,"Review: Does my presentation give a clear picture of the project?",,"Hi everyone,
Just got over with a website for our surveillance project we bunch of students are planning to do. I've made a website presenting the idea through a slideshow. Since, we 4 people work on the project, we already have a good idea of what we're doing. I just wished to check if people too do get the right message that we're trying to convey. Just for a reality check, what impression do you get about the project when you look at the presentation ?
have a look - http://spacelock.madetokill.com/<p>One point someone mentioned is that I never actually described the project in detail on our website... I'm working on that right now. I wonder if I should actually explain every detail of the project, it's meant for a contest - Student2Business, should I disclose the whole working ? the basic architecture is already visible. There are some features which we wish to keep secret too!<p>Thanks",1234099004

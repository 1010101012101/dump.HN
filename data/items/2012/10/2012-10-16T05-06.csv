It's not easy on a 2-sided platform, but our efforts are paying off. Every day we save people $1000s; that's not a soundbite, we really do.

That's simply not true. Your case was unfortunate, but it wasn't really a complex flight.

4658567,comment,4658391,4658391,5,0,benhamner,,,"Well written, but I believe you missed the point of the original article.<p>No one ever claimed that taking one class made someone an expert ""data scientist."" Instead, that single class wetted Luis, Jure, and Xavier's (the three competition winners) appetites, and pushed them more to learn more about machine learning and natural language processing. They then went on to dive much deeper, and excelled specifically in one area of applied NLP.<p>However, without that first class, there's a good chance none of them would have ever focused on (or heard of) machine learning. Their story is growing increasingly common. Like the Netflix Prize, Andrew Ng's first Coursera class did its part in shining a spotlight onto our dark little corner of the universe.<p>I'd be very cautious about a long checklist of items that are necessary to be a successful data scientist (which is a pretty ill-defined and encompassing term at this point). That is a decent summary of many useful tools of the trade, but they are by no means useful for all problem domains. For example, I could spend years working on machine learning for EEG brain-computer interfaces without a good reason to use databases or ""big data"" NoSQL technologies. I especially enjoyed MSR's take on the matter in ""Nobody ever got fired for using Hadoop on a cluster"" <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/163083/hotcbp12%20final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/163083/hotcbp12%20final.p...</a><p>When we're hiring data scientists or seeking successful ones, we've found focusing on demonstrated excellence in one relevant area plus general quantitative competencies and the curiosity and tenacity to learn new tools and techniques works far better than a laundry list of skills and experiences.",1350365452

4658565,comment,4654944,4655288,7,0,rayiner,,,"I think the best thing is to cultivate some perspective, and not hold the political system to unrealistically high standards.<p>We live in a 236 year old democracy of 310 million people. Let that sink in. We have more people than there are lines of code in an entire Linux distribution. Think of the complexity of a human being, over a human being's lifetime, versus a line of code. We're an incredibly heterogeneous, diverse country that has never agreed on anything, not even on our founding documents.* We are, by virtue of our post-WWII status, the de-facto political and military leader of the world. We're the world's largest economy. We're the world's reserve currency. We have all of the responsibility that comes with that status.<p>We do not blink twice when we hear of a company like Yahoo (14,000 employees) or Nortel (86,000 employees at peak) becoming unmanageable basket cases. Yet we rail on the President for not getting more done than he does! We forgive Windows for being layers upon tangled layers of bug-for-bug compatible code, but complain endlessly about the complexity of a tax code designed to regulate 300m people acting together in a $15 trillion economy.<p>I am of the opinion that too many people, especially engineers who maybe have a particular love of simplicity, simply expect too much of the country they live in, and as a result become disillusioned with the whole system.<p>It is my opinion that these expectations are unreasonable and counter productive. The fact of the matter is that the US government is a paragon of virtue and efficiency compared to most others. Some of the western European countries may have better governments, but they also have far simpler and more homogenous societies to govern. We certainly have a better government than most any country in Asia. China, which has no particular love of anything American, has spent the last couple of decades trying to model their legal system after America's. Think about that: something that most Americans consider to be a broken part of our society, is a model for a country looking to cement it's place among the world's great societies.<p>So if you're frustrated by the system, take a step back and appreciate the fact that it probably doesn't get any better than it is now. As I've gotten older and this realization has sunk in, I have found politics far more enjoyable.<p>*) The more you learn about the Constitution, the more you realize it's ridiculous to ask ""what does the Constitution mean?""

Is it just errant, broad pessimism?<p>On the contrary, it's not necessarily pessimism, the people who feel that way are probably just rather focused on the issues where the candidates are depressingly similar. For example if you want to see military spending massively reduced, the financial system reformed in fundamental ways to reduce systemic risk, or massively increased gasoline taxes to cover infrastructure improvements or green energy development, you probably feel badly served by both parties and their candidates right now.<p>On the other hand, if you're a gay man who wants to get married and start a family, or a redneck who wants to be able to carry your .357 magnum wherever you want whenever you want, or a rich guy who wants to keep your taxes as close to zero as can be achieved under the current two party system, the party differences are rather more obvious to you.<p>It's not really a question of pessimism, just the way people prioritize things. A person who has a lot of strong interests in the first category of issues (where the parties are rather similar, or just similarly useless) might be a lot more likely to say the parties are the same than a person whose strong interests are in the other set of issues.",1350365379

Places like Ooyala and Evernote might not be as large as Google, but they still have a pretty high programming bar.<p>If you're having trouble even getting in the door, the best way to turn a medium resume into an good one is to have interesting projects on github.<p>Failing that, the best strategy is to apply to more companies, and to not just restrict yourself to companies even as large as Evernote. Go for smaller startups. You could try, for example, contacting every single YC startup from the past few years. A friend of mine got a dream job at an NFL team this way - he applied to every American professional sports team every year for a few years, and despite a 99.7% failure rate, his persistence eventually got him a job.",1350364848

For example, common topics like Nazis, Jews, Islam, abortion, inferior women, blacks.<p>However, these were not topics I had in mind for ethics or such. We deal with in this community the ethics and morality of business and commerce. Along side, we deal with programmers who can do great good or great harm.

I think you're right. In cases of people acting like a 'shitcock', doing _something_ seems rational to keep the community in check. But stopping people who only want to interrupt the community is much different than those that take hard stances elsewhere.<p>As an example, I use GNU extensively and am a communist (used in sense of economic policy).

4658543,comment,4658391,4658391,1,0,001sky,,,"Isn't the real skill for a Data Scientist one of scalability and abstraction, from Data? While its critical to be able to get the data and make it more plastic, for measurement of metrics, real-time pricing, or even various weak-form predictive variables, its ultimately the analysis and understanding that is Critical to monetization/value extraction. And to build a good system for this level of data transparency, you need some good high-level understanding for clarity of vision. There are lots of people good at all manner Quants, but like the interview question, how much complexity can you explain in 5 minutes? is not one all answer equally. The ability to scale from granular detail to abstract levels of organization, meaning, and pattern recognition, are critical to extracting value in these contexts.<p>Also, its not clear folks are using consistently the term  vis a via scale/scope. Consider an anaolgue of knowledge and expertise (real estate example):<p>L1 Architect><p>l2 Contractor><p>L3 Sub-contrator><p>L4 Builder/Laborer><p>Is Data scientist an Architect? Or the person that builds the building? Is he the guy that does the plumbing?  Although the up and coming ""quantitative system analyst"" probably doesn't quite ring the same tune on a biz card.  And most refer to lower level quant mastery, eg. social engineering or quantitative finance, as a ""black art"" not a science. Without a high level vision, the concept/title seems...grandiose, until you get to very extreme levels of skill. And then it makes sense.",1350364633

4658523,comment,4652722,4652722,1,0,JBMmagdaong,,,"Creating a website for me expresses the hidden creativity in your mind. But before producing a well defined website, you have to consider a lot of factors first. To Begin with, a web designer must first consider how to have an effective optimization, its the greatest command that you have to remember in creating a website.<p>Next to optimization is get rid of Java script and CSS off to your page in order to have a better and faster coding process which lead to easy managing of your web content. Removing Java Script and CSS well produce greater space that speeds up web progress. Like for example, if you have a 20 KB document, eradicating the java script and CSS will convert this file from 20 KB to 15 KB, thus as Ive said will then speed up processing.<p>Aside from removing Java and CSS, you should also remember to validate the code of your web according to W3C standards. The purpose of this is to prevent accessibility issues which is not good for search engines. 
Another step is having a browsable navigation link by having an HTML navigational structure that includes footer text, links, DHTML and etc. But remember that using a Flash or Java Script is a big no because this will lead to coding blocks which can be dangerous to your web content.<p>Another thing to consider is your URL constructions. Please refer to Squahhot.com for more information about how Query Strings URL works.<p>With all this processing steps, let us be careful also with our web content. You should not duplicate your web content, or just simply copy paste it from other sources. Doing this will prioritize your ideas, and preventing similarities of content from other sources (thats if you just copy and paste it).<p>With all this in mind, the last step in creating an effective website is to launch it with Proper Foundation. Try to check if you have applied all the necessary means such as XML sitemaps, RSS Feeds, stuff like that. A properly founded website should have no issues with regards to loading a page, browser compatibility, SEO elements, robots.txt validation and etc.",1350363821

I'm in the same boat to a degree -- I have several businesses that throw off a combined $3-5k per month in cashflow.  Nothing to sneeze at, but you have to start somewhere.<p>Also just sold one ""lifestyle business"" (was only putting in 1 hour a month on it, literally) for low to mid five figures.<p>""Startups"" seem to have that Get Big Fast mentality, where you're either the next YouTube in 18 months, or you're a failure.  But it doesn't have to be that way...",1177534232

That already seems to be happening.<p>But that's OK for justin - because their business model is to sell this solution to others, and they've already proved it works.<p>On the other hand, Upstream is more of a social network type site that takes facebook stalking to a new level.  I envision people using it to keep tabs on what their friends are up to.  Who knows if it'll work, though.  ",1177532405

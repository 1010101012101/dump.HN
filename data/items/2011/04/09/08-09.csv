Greek and Latin were more important, as well as knowledge of geography of the known world and algebra and geometry.<p>Algebra and geometry, I feel, are still important today (see SAT). Greek and Latin are less important, although they are still in the background. The humanities have changed and we now learn about more modern authors / topics and the humanities classes in general have cooler names (i.e. Microcomputer Application in Kinesiology or Topics in African Society and Culture).<p>There's probably some bigger point I'm missing here like ""those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it"" or something similar.<p>Teaching kids about how to conjugate Latin verbs or some other rote activity always seemed pointless to me.

But you are looking at manufacturers trying to sell cars that need to be serviced down the line. service centers are not trained to handle X technology and the only place you could get it serviced would be the dealership. As a consumer I probably would not want to take the risk of an unknown longevity engine with unknown costs to fix it so I can save 20% on fuel; the engine design must be > 50%-75% less fuel(or some other reason that would make it a no brainer) used to make it worth taking a gamble on unknown quantities.",1302337849

2426759,comment,2425460,2426112,1,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"You are completely wrong about what ""open source"" means then. ""Free Software"" was designed to guarantee that you, the user, always got access to the source code, and was able to make changes and share them.<p>""Open Source"" was specifically intended to sell a similar idea to corporations, and less idealistic programmers, mostly by dropping that key requirement. I'm surprised you've not noticed the last 20 years of GPL vs. BSD flame wars which should have made this obvious.<p>Google went out of their way to drop ""free software"" from the top of their stack in Android, ironically, because the manufacturers and carriers wouldn't play ball without it. At this point, the Businessweek story (well, the few bits that haven't been entirely refuted as false) sounds similar to record labels that demanded Apple add DRM to their music, then wondered why Apple suddenly had such great lock-in power over the market.<p>Except... nothing about even GPL'd Free Software compels you to release the source until after you ship to consumers. Even then you could add a few months delay by forcing people to buy the product then write you a letter then post it in the least helpful form you think you could get away with. Absolutely nothing would prevent you from signing corporate agreements and giving sneak peeks to your favored manufacturing partners. Basically, if you're writing the code, you have power. You have the power to write what you want, mostly under the licence you want, with whatever priorities you have. This applies as much to a Linux dev who decides to quit and become a monk as it does to Ubuntu ditching Gnome 3 to try their Unity stuff. It might suit you if they did something else, but people making petulant demands on developers is only commonly associated with open source, not actually part of the definition.<p>What's weird is that I thought I was fairly extreme on the ""Free Software"" side of things by most standards, and especially HN standards. However, it appears if you dare to use the word ""open"" in your advertising (and to be frank, I thought they were talking about smartphone stuff, like being able to install software of your choice) the tech hivemind will crucify you if you're not more extreme than RMS, someone who wouldn't use the phrase ""open source"" never mind the more wishy-washy ""open"" which basically could mean anything.

Every musician has there own pitch, there own style, with which they compete for a listeners attention.<p>It&#x27;s not that <i>anyone</i> who picks up a guitar or drumset or ableton can be a professional, it&#x27;s that these things are more accessible than ever and, much more importantly, the means of distribution is almost completely accessible to anyone. This means that there is a huge amount of music to choose from and a huge variety. Yes, a lot of it is crap, but there is still more that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> due to the sheer volume of content (keep in mind that what is and isn&#x27;t good is subjective. Even if you and I agree that musician X is terrible, maybe there&#x27;s someone  who <i>likes</i> terrible.)<p>What this all boils down to is that professionals are losing there competitive edge, quickly. Publishing no longer needs a guarantee of profit because setup cost has dropped to practically nothing and distribution cost IS nothing. They can offer more varied and nuanced music, but when it comes down to it most people just want something to play and don&#x27;t have stringent requirements for their music. Amateur music is quickly filling in that gap, <i>especially</i> on the electronic front (not just EDM, there is a huge variety of music composed digitally that sounds nothing like your standard rave music).<p>In the end, music is becoming what it used to be, a cultural phenomenon.",1379293190

I wrote it in about 15 minutes in a fit of inspiration and free time.  If it&#x27;s useful to anyone I&#x27;ll clean it up and add the features I enumerated in the README.)<p>How it works:<p>The input to the algorithm is the look-up table you want to optimize.  I&#x27;ve mostly tested with a half-dozen or so pairs of small (1 or 2 digit) integers, as that is my use case.  (Anything else is probably better served by an actual look-up table or binary branch tree.)  Input values left out of the this table are considered &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; (i.e. there&#x27;s no &quot;default&quot; output).<p>The Prolog portion just generates, via iterative-deepening, bit-arithmetic expressions.  These expressions have as terminals the input variable (in theory, there could be multiple input variables; haven&#x27;t tried this) and arbitrary (i.e. symbolic) named constants.<p>The expressions are, in turn, fed as-is to Z3 as a function over bit-vectors (note the constants are still arbitrary).  The look-up table is fed to Z3 as a set of assertions about this function.  Z3 is asked to prove (un)satisfiability; if the problem <i>is</i> satisfiable, (this is the important part!) it returns the values of the constants which make it satisfiable.  These values are substituted in the original expression, which is then returned by the Prolog script as a solution.",1379293142
6390994,comment,6389498,6390843,4,0,FreakLegion,,,"Well, it&#x27;s a deliberate change that he makes later on in response to a feeling that people (not only critics, but admirers like Sartre) haven&#x27;t understood his work. In &quot;Letter on Humanism&quot; he says of the relatively straightforward language of <i>Being and Time</i>:<p><i>I have learned to see that these very terms were bound to lead immediately and inevitably into error. For the terms and the conceptual language corresponding to them were not rethought by readers from the matter particularly to be thought; rather, the matter was conceived according to the established terminology in its customary meaning.</i><p>In short, he tried to say something new using all the old terms[1], and that allowed readers to assume something about the meaning of those terms rather than work it out for themselves. So, to get his point across, Heidegger starts looking for a new way of saying, one without shortcuts, one that forces readers to think things through.<p>Did it work? In a sense. Of course it also ensured that a lot of people will never bother reading Heidegger. For me, I simply treated Heidegger as a foreign language and learned to speak it. Once you&#x27;re over the hump, he&#x27;s not wildly difficult, and the reward, I think, is not unlike what you get out of learning, say, a functional programming language. It gives you new eyes, rather than just showing you some new thing.<p>1. &#x27;Term&#x27; is often used with a special meaning in Heidegger. From <i>On the Way to Language</i> (with a few bits omitted): &quot;Everybody sees and hears words. They are; they can be like things, palpable to the senses. To offer a crude example, we only need to open a dictionary. It is full of printed things. Indeed, all kinds of things. Plenty of terms, and not a single word. Because a dictionary can neither grasp nor keep the word by which the terms become words and speak as words.&quot;",1379293114

The spinning was going the wrong way, therefore the way to reverse it was to reverse something involving cos or sin.  You can then just bruteforce it by reversing each cos until you get the effect you want.  (If reversing cos seems to reverse something &quot;perpendicular&quot; to what you want, then you&#x27;d need to reverse the sin instead, not the cos.)<p>This is true in almost any context involving 2D/3D graphics, not just for this particular example.  It&#x27;s much more efficient than trying to sit there and think through the math or figure out what does what.  But of course you learn less that way, so it&#x27;s a tradeoff.

6390979,comment,6386797,6388186,2,0,potatolicious,,,"I&#x27;ve chatted with some professional designers about exactly this and the opinions have been pretty consistent - they dislike/hate the internal homescreen.<p>There are a bunch of issues I&#x27;ve seen raised (and I agree with):<p>- It&#x27;s hard to parse. We read left/right (or right/left as the language goes), or top/down. We don&#x27;t read in zigzag easily. A tiled layout makes parsing a list of items difficult. This is, at the end of the day though, a fairly minor complaint compared to the rest.<p>- It gives unimportant features equal prominence to your primary features. This is, IMO, the biggest knock against using this UI. When Facebook used the internal homescreen (once upon a time) the &quot;Notes&quot; feature was given equal prominence to &quot;News Feed&quot;, which seems pure silliness. When Yelp used it, the &quot;My Account&quot; feature was equal in prominence to &quot;Search&quot; and &quot;Nearby&quot;. This happens because in almost all cases where internal homescreens are used it&#x27;s because the devs can&#x27;t find a better way to communicate the apps different features to the user, so the solution is to bundle it all up into a bunch of tiles and let the user deal with it.<p>- It encourages a high degree of modality. You launch into into this massive 9-way fork in the road, and this encourages deep UIs where it&#x27;s difficult to move between the different branches without backing all the way back up to the root. The original Facebook app suffered terribly from this. The trend in recent years has been a move towards flatter, more laterally traversible UIs. See for example the Facebook Chat Heads - where messaging is embedded throughout the app without making it modal. The ubiquitous side-menu that&#x27;s almost universal in iOS today is a slightly less elegant solution to the same - though in the slide-menu&#x27;s defense, it&#x27;s less disruptive than taking over your whole screen.<p>- It&#x27;s user friction you didn&#x27;t have to incur. If I launch into Facebook it&#x27;s a pretty safe assumption I&#x27;m checking my news feed. You can also contextually <i>very</i> easily determine what I want to do - if I have outstanding unread messages received recently, take me to messaging. Don&#x27;t make the user choose if you have a high degree of confidence about what the user is looking for. A good example of this done well is, IMO, Ness - instead of asking you for cuisines or price ranges to execute a search, it does a default search based on smart defaults (which takes into account your last search, as well as time of day and other factors), and gives you easily tools to tweak the results to what you really want. A homescreen says &quot;I have no idea what you want, so here&#x27;s <i>everything</i>&quot;. Imagine going to Google.com and getting dropped in a large list of everything Google does.",1379292823

We aren&#x27;t. <i>All</i> professions deal with uncertainty and most of them deal with it deliberately[1]. Throwing your hands in the air because a perfect prediction is impossible is just silly; an estimate is <i>by definition</i> an <i>uncertain</i> statement of an <i>unknown</i> variable.<p>Estimating software can be difficult because there are many points at which complexity can be multiplied (McConnell&#x27;s example of the requirement &quot;validate phone numbers&quot; shows a span of minutes to months)[2]. But when you see very wide ranges on an estimate, it&#x27;s a signal that the problem is poorly understood.<p>Outside of <i>genuinely novel research</i>, improving estimation accuracy is possible and valuable.

How do you reconcile these two?<p>Apart from that, you have the &quot;buy American&quot; movement, and you have this situation where US Americans identify themselves with (often fictitious) ethnic identities: Irish American, Italian American, African American, etc. Why call them &quot;fictitious&quot;?

And if you try to disappear with your families, they will probably die too.&quot;<p>American military commanders do not regard leaders of the Revolutionary Guard as social equals with whom they share the bonds of class. They will hunt them and kill them like animals. We know it. They know it. Everybody knows it.<p>>Well, not without nukes. I&#x27;d bet on Russia or China&#x27;s nukes over the US conventional military any day.<p>To do what? Protect Iran from retaliation? Thanks to economic integration, neither country could afford to harm America this severely. China especially.<p>The larger point is that, even without nukes, we are an exceedingly dangerous country to attack. While the American people can and do balk at the prospect of constant aggression coming from the hawks in Washington, they can be counted on to support absolutely devastating levels of violence if attacked directly.<p>> It means that the US can&#x27;t just start a war with China or threaten them with nuclear attack because a state of MAD exists.<p>No, threatening one city is not &#x27;destruction&#x27; in the MAD sense. Mutually Assured Destruction is the logical outcome of nuclear conflict in which the only way to avoid retaliation is to wipe the enemy off the map, in a surprise first-strike. The Nuclear Triad was developed as a counter-strategy to ensure that this wasn&#x27;t possible. Even if a Soviet first-strike did leave every man, woman, and child dead, the Triad (composed of ICBMs, perpetually-airborne fleets of B-52s and several Trident subs) meant we&#x27;d still retain the power to respond in kind. The exchange would mark the last act of both nations. In essence, it was a suicide pact that treated the rest of humanity as collateral damage.<p>That&#x27;s not even remotely close to what was being promised in the conversation over Taiwan. More to the point, the conversation didn&#x27;t end there, since China cares about having the US as a market more than it cares about having Taiwan as a provence.",1379290702

It&#x27;ll cost two working models and you need perhaps a dozen packed up and well hidden to be effective. I would imagine the reaction would never be declassified, and I&#x27;ll be surprised if it hasn&#x27;t already happened.<p>This is the logic of nuclear blackmail, and in general of brinkmanship. It has been used before, if the relevant Wikipedia page is to be believed.<p>It is a dangerous and unpredictable threat. The Cold War strategy asserted that only mutually assured destruction would be sufficient to bring about peace. A dozen nuclear bombs, under that logic, is not enough. If it were, the results of the Cuban Missile Crisis would have been a lot different. If it were then the US would not have built its huge arsenal of nuclear warheads - 12 per nation would have been enough.<p>You say &quot;always think outside the box&quot;, but nothing you&#x27;ve mentioned is outside of the box. In fact, it&#x27;s boringly in the box. First off, there&#x27;s nothing special about containerized shipping. A 1 MT bomb weighs less than a ton, and you could bring that in via tramp freighter or even private sailboat.<p>It&#x27;s almost needless to say, but we also had a lot of cargo ships in 1900. The Halifax Explosion of 1917 was equivalent to about 2.9 kilotons, and that was with conventional explosive. Blow up that ship at a wharf in NYC and it will take down skyscrapers.<p>For that matter, look to drug smugglers. A single speedboat in June was captured, with 3 tons of cocaine on it. Narco-submarines are believe to carry in several hundred tons of cocaine per year. A 49-foot sailboat was recently intercepted 400 nautical miles off the US coast, on the way from Venezuela to Canada with 621 kg of drugs on board. Any of these are enough to deliver a megaton bomb.<p>&quot;More than a dozen years ago, how would Saudi Arabia knock down skyscrapers in NYC? That&#x27;s insanity, they&#x27;d have to launch cruise missiles or build a battleship and successfully park it off the coast of NYC, or invade overland with bulldozers or something.&quot;<p>This is not true. You need only to look to the movies of more than a dozen years ago to learn about some alternatives.<p>&quot;The Peacemaker&quot; has a Yugoslav named Duan Gavri who comes close to exploding a nuclear device at the UN.<p>&quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; has a group of Palestinians who set off a nuclear bomb at the Superbowl in Denver.<p>I pointed out movies to show that the alternatives were part of popular culture, but I could stick with real-life.<p>The W54 warhead weighed about 23 kg and had a yield up to 1 kiloton. It was used to make a backpack nuke - the Special Atomic Demolition Munition. This could take down a few blocks of NYC.<p>And of course the first attempt to take down the World Trade Center was in 1993 using car bombs. That failed, but in principle that could be used to take down a skyscraper.<p>So in real-life and in the movies there were many other options beyond cruise missiles, battleships, or bulldozers.",1379290376

The specific accusation made in the mainstream press was that by the time the instruments were sliced and diced a dozen times, risk was not made clearly visible to derivative purchasers, and that the buying and selling of derivatives got way ahead of the banks&#x27; ability to track the risk inside of them. At high leverages, it became such that being wrong by just a few percentage points could mean financial disaster. The guarantee that Freddie and Fannie made contributed to a general feeling that the market was mostly protected from huge systemic risks, when that wasn&#x27;t the case at all.",1379289732

They are a tool, nothing more.<p>Other than that, I agree.  It was the lack of a central clearing house for the derivatives -which would have allowed issuers to determine counter party risks and price it properly -that was the failing.  But that&#x27;s a human error.  There&#x27;s no need whatsoever to blame the securities themselves.",1379289703

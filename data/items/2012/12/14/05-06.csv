Those were threaded and had specialized clients allowing to easily find new posts, replies to own posts, filter content, etc.<p>The great improvement web brought wasn't flatness but post-moderation, editing and later karma/voting/sorting.

I guess it reminds people to vote, and most readers don't actually care to downvote you.  (Usually comments will make ""haters"" really angry but not have any impact on people that agree or are neutral, so you get downvoted on a comment that most people like.

4919778,comment,4919111,4919744,2,0,saurik,,,"> Now, you could argue that lots of topics on a forum is a ""kind"" of threading...<p>Yes, not only could I, but I have in all of my posts here so far, very explicitly. ;P A ""classic web forum"" has four levels: categories, forums, threads, and posts. It is critical to look at a web forum as having all of these levels if you want to compare it to a site like HN, as otherwise it is impossible to discuss how end users are able to navigate the site.<p>As an example, let's say that we were going to talk about your article on a normal web forum. First of all, that forum may already be divided into ""on-topic"" and ""meta"" forum categories, and there may then be multiple forums that are interested in your talk: the conversations don't conflict.<p>However, even within the same forum on the site (which will often then have the same general participant pool), your article will spawn multiple unrelated threads, each of which will consist of linear posts. Each of these threads will be discussing different areas of the topic, and you can ignore the threads you aren't interested in.<p>Hacker News can't do that: your article can only create a single top-level link, and all conversation has to exist underneath that. You get the same levels near the top (although managed in a distributed collaborative fashion by the users, as opposed to directed by the site operators), but additionally as you drill down it might get very deep.<p>... and, once again, I will agree with you that HN has a problem managing the discussion near the leaves of the tree. (FWIW, I actually was not allowed to reply to your post, but decided ""screw that"" and did it anyway: it could be nice to see something linear once you get this deep instead of just turning off ""reply"" altogether.)<p>> If you can point me to any web discussion communities that are 10+ years old which use threading, I'd love to see them.<p>In addition to classic web forums, which I maintain are the typical 4-5 level hierarchical tree, you will find websites like Slashdot, which is definitely a 10+ year old web discussion community, and is insanely threaded with tons of awesome mechanisms to handle that complexity (such as the feature of ""bubbling up"" good comments I mentioned elsewhere in this thread).<p>> but I'd never, ever see it because it is forever married to its place in the tree and the iron-clad parent child reply hierarchy<p>The solution reddit has for this--both in the commonly-used Reddit Enhancement Suite and as a feature you can buy as part of reddit Gold--is to mark new sections of the tree in an obvious way (such as with a blue box). I believe DISQUS does this as well now, and I have a similar feature in the HN script I sometimes run. In a system like USENET, you would have the option of resorting the messages in your client by date.<p>However, I maintain that a purely linear discussion model doesn't solve these problems: it just makes the content not exist in the first place. If you were to build even just a two-level system--links and posts; to contrast with a class web forum's four levels--which on HN would look like each article discussion being a linear chat, you could only have one of these conversations, as the interleaving would be crazy.",1355463966

You may have heard the term ""natural philosophy"" as an old term for science, but it betrays that fact that what we now call science was just another branch of philosophy.<p>Remember that Descartes also authored major mathematical works. Philosophers of that day could and did do a little bit of everything. Anyway, his argument, and the other arguments of them time, were based on things like the fact that if the speed of light were finite, you would notice things like the sun, moon, and earth being out of alignment during an eclipse, since the earth's shadow would lag behind it. Since no such misalignment was observed, the speed of light must be infinite. Later philosophers pointed out, of course, that it was also possible that the speed of light was finite but very fast, and the eclipse lag time was immeasurably small.

One, coverage outside of the core downtown areas is comparatively sparse and irregular.

If you can point me to any web discussion communities that are 10+ years old which use threading, I'd love to see them.<p>Now, you could argue that lots of topics on a forum is a ""kind"" of threading, and I guess if I squint really hard I could see it, but that's a far cry from here or Reddit, where it's indentation city all the time.<p>> it still does help slow the rate at which a thread can get very deep.<p>I think that's too clever by half, but more than that, nowhere <i>near</i> as effective as an explicit cap on reply depth. Hacker News would be a better discussion system for everyone if the reply depth was capped at, say, 3.<p>(And of course if it had the ability to collapse branches, which is sorely needed. Nothing is more frustrating to me than being forced to read through 50+ replies about some dumb tangent I don't care about, to possibly get to something I do care about.)<p>And now that I've written the above, I realize that there might still be some awesomely insightful reply in that 50+ branch on politics -- but I'd never, ever see it because it is forever married to its place in the tree and the iron-clad parent child reply hierarchy... and cannot be sorted independently on its own merits and votes.

4919694,comment,4919287,4919287,2,0,sonicvoxel,,,"I think this is a good premise - the current form of file management is definitely outdated and not nearly as functional as it could be. It seems like you guys want to do for every storage/sharing service what Dropbox does for Finder/Explorer by making management as simple and as transparent as a regular directory on your filesystem.\nHere are my thoughts on this: first, I think you (or the users) are going to run into a problem eventually of redundant data. If I am sharing my photos across 3 or 4 different services, how do I keep track of the individual files? If I make a change to one, do the changes get propagated across the other services?  Or do I have to do manual copies? What if I upload pictures from a mobile app or a web interface, and then upload the same files to another service? From the screenshot it seems as though you divide up functionality by individual service, which makes sens, but what if you included a 'Pictures' or 'Music' or 'Whatever' view, much like smart folders work in Finder now? And like smart folders, these views would be customizable. Would you have this integrated into spotlight or roll your own indexing feature? A good search is going to be essential for this kind of app.\nI like benwerds idea of a programmable activity stream, but in order to reach a general audience with this app that kind of functionality would have to be built in. I think its safe to assume that most users aren't interested in extensive customizability and personal scripting, so even though a truly programmable file manager (possibly to replace both the command line and the file manager?) is a wonderful idea for technical users and I think something like that is in our future, but I feel like that is beyond the scope and focus of this app.<p>Here are a couple of specific things I would like to see:<p>- transparent music management. If I am browsing my music 'collection', I would like to have them appear side-by-side with my favorited songs on soundcloud, or my amazon cloud drive or spotify or youtube. When I click on the song, it will stream it from whatever source it belongs to, but will all use the same play/pause/scrub controls. This idea could also be applied to videos, or even photos and text. However of course this would mean creating your own viewers/players (so maybe not something for a 1.0) but I think a feature like that would be necessary to create the total ""transparent cloud"" experience, because otherwise the task of music listening becomes a chore of managing different apps, web and otherwise. ""Buy/Download"" buttons next to each remote song would be cool, and once bought, all that would happen is the button would disappear and the song would show up as being on your local (or on your cloud drive or whatever). It would still maintain the same position on your playlist.\nNow that I look at the screenshot more, it looks like you're already doing some of this with pictures.<p>- Dual/split panes, a la commander. Please. It makes life so much better.<p>- Command line support. It doesn't need to be scriptable, but I think somehow exposing your objects to the filesystem like dropbox does would be a good solution, even though you may not be able to do it like they do by storing the files on both the local machine and the server, since I feel that would defeat the purpose of using cloud backup services. Which objects to expose and how might be a tricky question for some services (like twitter), but I just want to be able to cd around and cp files to and fro, so for services that just store/share media, this would be pretty straightforward.<p>- Hotkey show/hide. I love TotalFinder (<a href=""http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/</a>) and TotalTerminal for this reason. It makes general maneuvering about on my box so fluid (thats what she said), and its become a dealbreaker enough for me that I've passed up a number of ""better Finders"" for this reason. It doesn't have to slide in from anywhere, but I just want it to show up when I press something and hide when I press something.<p>More than I expected to write; I guess I've been thinking a lot about this kind of app.",1355461570

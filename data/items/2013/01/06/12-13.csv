He got the requisite comprehensible input.  He achieved a good level of language skill, but for the time he put in it wasn't exceptional.<p>L2 acquisition linguists generally agree that the important thing is ""massive comprehensible input"".  This could be reading or listening.  There is disagreement on whether if input <i>alone</i> is enough-- hardliners such as Krashen would say yes, others would say no.  However, there's little disagreement that input is the most important factor.  And an SRS will never keep up with actually reading a book when it comes to input.<p>3 years ago, I was that guy with a huge SRS deck, reading AJATT and writing my own blog about it.  If you're unconvinced with the above, all I can say is make your huge SRS deck, do it daily and then come back in a few years and let me know how it went.",1357476924

5016202,story,,,66,75,fHbjKlf6,"Ask HN: Macbook Air + Remote Server = Macbook Pro?",,"As a developer I need to test code on multiple versions of Windows and for this I have 4 virtual machines running on a Lenovo W500/8GB/256GB laptop plugged into a 24"" monitor. For convenience I often have all four running concurrently. However with 8GB ram I often run out of memory and I'm low on disk space, hence my motivation to upgrade. I'm just about to purchase the new retina Macbook pro/16GB/512GB as it would appear a perfect fit as I could easily run all the VM's concurrently with room to spare and being on an SSD they would also be super-fast.<p>However I really value mobility especially around the house and the Macbook Air 13""/8GB/256GB comes highly recommended by peers. I had an epiphany thinking that perhaps I could rent a dedicated server to relieve the memory and disk requirements. With an Intel i7-2600 Quad/16GB/6TB-raid1 from Hetzner.de (50 Euro p.m), I could host all my Windows desktop VM's and also a few Ubuntu server VM's and use remote desktop and SSH to access them respectively. I realize there will be some additional latency but thats fine for what I need to use them for and I have a 60Mb/s fiber connection.<p>Has anyone else attempted something similar? Am I missing anything? My preliminary research points me to using Linux KVM as the host. Can I really forgo the weight/size of a Retina 15"" (+- $3900 here in Europe) for the Macbook air ($2300) + a remote server. Obviously I would be sacrificing the Retina screen and the dedicated GPU but neither is important to me, especially as I spend half my time plugged into a 24"" monitor + mechanical keyboard. Additionally I'm not concerned about the cost of a server as I already have many very underutilized servers at my disposal and so it wouldn't cost any extra. Any advice would extremely helpful.

If you're a decent Node.js programmer, it's like stepping up to ""Node Pro"", in the sense that you work close to the metal with your web server so everything feels clean and easy to wrap your mind around.<p>But Go code is cleaner and tighter. The code formatting conventions contribute to that greatly, as well as the fact that you just don't have to pull in as much 3rd party code because so much functionality is already beautifully integrated.<p>There are a lot of positives about Go that reveal themselves over the first couple days of coding in it.<p>I do wish the documentation convention included not only a brief description each function, etc., but also a brief example.<p>By the way, I also evaluated Scala for a few days before settling on Go as my preference. I like Scala, but it quickly becomes a sprawling language as your explore it further, and frameworks like Play and Lift bring even more baggage along for the ride. The core language, on its own, was attractive, but overall, the experience just didn't have the compact, robust, completely under control, and nimble feeling that came with Go.<p>Oh ya, and the Go syntax felt ugly and awkward at first. That feeling quickly faded after a day of use, but it's worth mentioning because I bet it turns some people away from Go before they even get to the great parts.<p>Just my 3 cents worth.",1357474887

However the fit between interviewer and interviewee is hugely variable, and you're never getting away from it.  My suggestion for a small team, therefore, is to have a group interview.  This probably does not reduce the interviewer/interviewee fit issue, but it <i>does</i> tend to leave people much more in agreement on candidates than when they interview separately, and therefore goes a long ways towards removing arguments over whether certain hires should have happened.<p>On standardization, there is one gotcha.  It is much easier to calibrate a standardized interview process and compare this candidate to that one.  However at some point you'll have a candidate who goes through your interview, and blogs the whole interview when they get home.  At that point you'll find that every candidate who bothers to do a basic search is curiously well-prepared for your interview - at which point your interview's value drops sharply.  At Google's size this happens constantly.  For a random startup, not so often.  But a hot startup should expect it.<p>Therefore I would recommend that to the rest of your list you add a monthly calendar entry to see what a search can turn up about your interview process so that you notice when it needs to change.",1357474577

Performance and thus optional strong typed is required.\nGo can have optional strong typed system, so performance may be improved in future, but its GC seems a big warning for me. I want to have option to allocate/free memory myself. the GC is also an enforcement of some design principle, which is also a big minus regarding the next point.<p>2. Great flexibility, basically the language should not make any decisions for developers. I dislike C++ for its OOP approach to make way too many decisions for developer. I want no limitation from a language. I can self restrain to avoid all troubles from freedom, I can design OOP/GC myself if it is neccessary, but please not make decision for me. (C++ did not enforce OOP, but most of the extra part beyond C usually distorts a good design otherwise) Lisp and C are almost perfect here. Does GO allow any weird design people may think of? any enforcement of some supposed-to-be good principle?<p>3. A script, which can relieve me on all details.

The movie is actually a pretty good adaptation.</i><p>I have absolutely no idea what you mean by ""pretty good"".  Enjoyable action movie?  Sure.  Has all of the right characters?  Check.  Actually follows the plot?  Complete fail.<p>Off of the top of my head, Bilbo should sign the contract the night before, wake up, and only actually go out because Gandalf comes and tells him that he's late.  When Bilbo goes to investigate the trolls, the dwarves have no fire and no idea what is there.  It should be Gandalf who gets the trolls to argue with each other, not Bilbo.  Azog should not appear in The Hobbit.  There should be no encounters with orcs until, possibly, the battle of the 5 armies.  There should be no encounter of goblins, or wargs until after visiting Elrond.  The dwarves should be made far more welcome - I personally had been looking forward to the Elvish songs they were supposed to be greeted with, and did NOT like seeing a bad repeat of the meeting between Aragorn and omer in <i>The Two Towers</i>.  Gandalf should leave Rivendell with the party.  The white council should not meet while the dwarves are there, nor in the book is there any hint of romance between Gandalf and Galadriel.  (Useless trivia, Galadriel is actually Elrond's mother-in-law.)  The dwarves should hear the stone giants - but not be caught riding them.  In the cave where they were captured, Bilbo wakes, sees goblins in the back, then shouts (which is how Gandalf escapes).  He doesn't wake, have an eloquent conversation, then have the floor cave in.  The goblin fight sequence is very long, entirely made up, and the goblin cave we see (complete with rickety structures, the messenger, and so on) owes no debt to Tolkien.  (Goblins chasing behind, yes.  Rivers of goblins coming from all directions being comically killed by every dwarf in sight, not so much.)  Bilbo should be lost by the party because he falls off of a dwarf's back while they are running, and not because he managed to avoid initial capture.  Bilbo should not meet the goblin that Gollum was killing when he lost the ring.  Bilbo should lose his buttons leaving the goblin cave, not squeezing through some random rocks.  The whole tree sequence complete with heroic fight, trees being pushed over, and dangling over cliffs...?  All made up.  As a reminder, in the book the wolves discover them, they hide in trees, Gandalf throws burning pine-cones, the wolves are driven crazy, goblins come, turn the fire on the trees, Gandalf gets ready to pay dearly with his life and then the eagles come and save him.<p>That's just off of the top of my head.  If I was to actually put effort in it, I'm sure I'd come up with a much longer list of differences.<p>Of all of the changes, the only one that I consider completely justified was making it light enough in the goblin cave fights for people to see.  A bunch of running in the dark would not translate to the screen very well.<p>Random disclaimer.  I have no idea how many times I've read the books.

Hello France? USSR? USA?<p>I'm a huge proponent of nuclear power - I think it's one of the cleaner and safer ways to provide energy, and I think nuclear fission combined with fossil fuels is probably enough to last until we develop fusion or hydrogen based power.<p>Anyway, the reason there's been no nuclear plants built without government action is because it's illegal to build a nuclear plant without government action, since processed uranium can be used to make nuclear weapons. I imagine you'd see more nuclear plants if the restrictions were lessened, and I reckon there'd be plenty of private investors to do it, though I'm not sure it's altogether a good idea in this case.<p>That said, nuclear power restricted to government-only is the reason it hasn't been built privately, and it's too bad it's forbidden from some areas. Nuclear power would be a godsend to a number of areas on the planet where the local ecosystem is particularly sensitive to pollution and the terrain isn't suitable for wind, solar, or hydroelectric.",1259466811

If you're concentrating on the results only, then I would recommend the standard acm judge (and similar competitions) technique - put the input on standard input and get the output from standard output. This way you can support all the languages that you're able to run (and you will get less people saying that they cannot use their favourite language X). But choose languages you know how to compile - I remember one competition from highschool times where Pascal people had their code optimised by default, but C people didn't - that sucked.<p>If it's about design, then look at your audience... there's not that much of a difference between python and java - just choose one.

965865,comment,965270,965270,0,0,Mz,,,"This piece only talks about the needs of the new mom and neglects to address reasons why the company should feel motivated to be accommodating.  That's like asking for a raise because you need money rather than because you bring more value to the company than you used to.  Here are a few reasons companies should make an effort to accommodate the needs of moms:<p>Diversity.  A diverse workforce is a strength for a company.  Excluding moms would cause a weakness in the corporate culture which may go entirely unrecognized, even if it ultimately helps contribute to the failure of the company.<p>One thing this particular form of diversity could help address:  The fact that females play games a lot less than males as well as generally have less interest in a variety of tech products.  If there were more women and mothers in programming, the odds are good that apps would be designed in a way which appealed more to the female market than many of them currently do.<p>Company policies that are friendly to moms and their kids tend to also be better climates for anyone who can't make it on ""traditional"" terms of success.  Finding an effective means to accommodate the rather large issue of motherhood would tend to automatically create a company culture and set of policies that resolved many lesser issues with little or no additional effort.  Happy workers who don't hate some aspect of their job are generally going to do a better job. If the working climate is vastly superior to that of your competitors, you will likely also garner high levels of employee loyalty and a lower turnover rate.  Lower turnover pays dividends in many ways, well beyond just the obvious savings of not having to spend so much time and money on the hiring process.",1259465292

It seems unlikely that we'll know anytime soon, either, given that Wave is meant to encompass a wider range of tasks than any of the systems is is typically compared with. Right now, we have the conventions of the linear or hierarchical conversations used by email and web forums, and we have the conventions of the collaboratively annotated and edited documents, but we don't know which to use in the gray areas, because that decision has previously been made by the choice of program. It feels to me like we're driving cars prior to the invention of turn signals, brake lights, stop signs, and demarcated lanes. We have to use trial and error to evolve the rules of the road.",1259464419

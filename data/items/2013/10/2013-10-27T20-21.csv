The only people who have the base level of Microsoft operating systems (or don&#x27;t apply patches between service packs) are the ones who are so clueless about security that they&#x27;re not likely to have gone out of their way to install a third-party anti-virus tool.<p>If they assume that most users apply all &quot;critical&quot; Windows updates in the order that they&#x27;re pushed, the anti-virus vendor could snapshot their reference PCs before each update and record the hashes of all Windows files. It&#x27;s possible to determine which updates have already been installed on a machine (there&#x27;s an option for this in the control panel, and the information is probably stored in the registry).",1382907578

Then some more details on the technical info - what do you mean by trend?

And even if a prospect visits your site knowing they have the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve, reiterating it in very clear terms will only make them more encouraged to buy your service.<p>-You need visuals, like images of restaurants, dishes, happy customers, happy owners, etc, stuff that&#x27;ll elicit an emotional response.<p>-Given the nature of the product, I would include a very simple graph to visually convey the concept of increasing revenues.<p>-You need testimonials or case studies. As a restaurant owner with a lot on my plate already, I need to know your product actually works and is worth implementing. A case study about how X restaurant discovered some hidden trends in their customer behaviors and tripled revenue in a year will make me more likely to pull the trigger.<p>-Your hook needs work. &quot;The best way to forecast for your restaurant&quot; doesn&#x27;t present a problem or a solution.

And that is the first way to do it in a new language.<p>So you wanna try recursion?  I feel fuzzy at this time but something like you call recurse(1000) and it calls recurse(999) and so on until it hits 0 and stops.  Now from memory my weird design was the return was returning the (the returned subtotal from calling recurse(x-1)) + x when x is a mult of 3 and not a mult of 5 + x when x is a mult of 5 and not a mult of 3 + x when x is a mult of 15 (15 is 3 and 5 at the same time))  Yeah or something like that. (edited what the heck was I thinking?  I&#x27;ll leave this as unedited, but thats not right.  This is a good fizz buzz example of give them the question, a wrong answer, and ask them to debug it.)<p>Another one to demonstrate your ability at screwing around with arrays is simply make an array size 1000 all zeroed out and a for loop to run thru all indexes of that array (now try not to fall off either edge) and if the array index is a mult of 3 or a mult of 5 then set that array value to the array index.  Finally add together all the values of the array.<p>Hmm so you&#x27;ve got a minor parallel processing cluster on hand and everyone runs some language you&#x27;re unfamiliar with and has access to a shared NFS dir so all 100 of your hosts run the worlds dumbest program that checks to see if 1000 files exist, if not, it picks a psuedo-random number between 0 and 1000, checks to see if its already been calculated, if not, it decides if that number is a mult of 3 or 5 and if it is, then a filename &quot;random-number&quot; appears using dd if=/dev/urandom of=&quot;random-number&quot; and you copy 1K blocks equal to the number of blocks in the random number (so file 14.crazy is zero bytes long but 15.crazy is precisely 15K in length) then given 100 workers randomly selecting a random number less than 1000 you have to run way more than 10 rounds but eventually all the shell scripts simultaneously terminate on all the worker nodes because ls | wc -l returned 1000 aka all 1000 results have been calculated.  Then you run cat * > result and du -k result to see how many K are used which is the sum of all the mults of 3 and 5 between 0 and 1000... I did this to torture test a small cluster and its NFS server and its network and disk IO a long while back.  I remember it took more rounds than you&#x27;d guess to test all 1000 digits and of course if varies, unless your psuedo-random number generator is screwed up.  Or you could intentionally use a screwed up RNG to see if its any good.  Also I did my run using M not K although a motivated lunatic would use G, I suppose, to really torture a NAS.  Isn&#x27;t this a diabolically insane and funny way to solve the problem?<p>On a simpler level, or a differently crazy level, you can do all your math in octal, just because.  It won&#x27;t really change anything but it looks entertaining.  And why not write your own octal-dec conversion routine, to print out the result, just because?<p>The point is not to do it the fastest or most obvious way but to screw around with odd ideas, not the same old boring fizzbuzz.<p>Graphical is hilarious instead of using a boring old array.  So what happens if you use a PNG graphics image to store your table of multiples?  So 15 is 15 black pixels?  This is an interesting way to test your ability to squirt out and in pixels.  Also does your PNG library interface like 1e6x1 graphics images and how scalable is it when you access the same graphics image 1e3 times does it scale?<p>There is a tiny problem that someone who thinks this is hilarious might use hilarious designs in production code.",1382905968

This is the same woman who is able to use Fedora for daily tasks and who has been using command-line ffmpeg to transcode personal videos for her various devices.<p>To &quot;get technology&quot; can mean a lot of things.  It could mean knowing how to use a terminal.  It could just as easily mean understanding that a desktop computer can do all the things that a TiVO can do, or that the Internet does not have any long distance fees, or that the <i>intended</i> use a computer is irrelevant in a conversation about the <i>possible</i> uses of a computer.

Having a basic idea of what the system will do is helpful, but in a system that has a lot of very specific business logic that has to be defined and HAS to be right in order to comply with the law, you&#x27;re not going to get very far without good requirements.<p>Without requirements, how would one expect very specific business logic? And what is so incredibly precise that it derails any possible planning for it? I&#x27;m not familiar with that type of problem.<p>> 2. CGI may very well have raised multiple red flags, and CMS and HHS could have promptly ignored them. That is one of the maddening things about government IT. You can tell the decision makers that they are heading for disaster and they can simply ignore you.<p>This is very true. Of course, with basic project management 101, these things are duly noted so that when you&#x27;re hauled in front of Congress, you&#x27;ve documented the situation. Based on CGI&#x27;s responses the other day, they surely didn&#x27;t do that -- otherwise, they would have raised it. Unless government IT work of this nature is classified?<p>> 3. Let&#x27;s say you plan for every one of your dependencies to fail. What useful product could you deliver in that case?<p>One that allows you to fix those problems independently, rather than tying the success of the entire project to the success of all integration. In a project where the requirements are constantly shifting, I&#x27;d say the &quot;useful product&quot; definition is dynamic and iterative. A strict all-or-nothing definition makes little sense in that environment.<p>> 4. Again, you can elicit as hard as you want, if they don&#x27;t give you the requirements because the law is still up in the air, or because the president might change his mind, or because someone wants to meet with all the stakeholders in the other agencies first, there is absolutely nothing you can do. I&#x27;ve been on projects where the stakeholder with the final say couldn&#x27;t be bothered to give their input until the software was done. I&#x27;ve also been on projects where the decision maker prevented us from getting the input of the employees that would actually be using the application. Sometimes the people you&#x27;re dealing with are not rational actors.<p>I get it; I&#x27;ve worked with federal agencies as well. It all goes back to project management and documenting interactions. As for logistics, there is <i>always</i> someone else to go to when a stakeholder is a bottleneck. Here&#x27;s something that I found that worked in my experience with some fed agencies: identify those who are considered a project dependency, and that project progress relies on specific people. When facts are presented simply, and project management details are documented...individuals get motivated to NOT see their name in lights. As always, your mileage may vary.<p>> 5. Fixing the contract award process is certainly part of the solution. Normally many teams could submit a bid for the work, but due to the insane time scale it was skipped for healthcare.gov. I think having a proof of concept competition after some sort of initial proposal selection gate could be useful. It could sort of be like how the military has contractors build prototypes for weapons systems competitions.<p>Absolutely. Basically, it&#x27;s an iterative phased approach, and let multiple teams go for it.",1382905732

I don&#x27;t have much experience selling to restaurants in particular so I can&#x27;t comment on the business model, but I can offer a couple pieces of advice regarding how to sell software to small businesses:<p>1) Good job emphasizing &quot;increase revenue&quot;. Software is an <i>incredibly</i> tough sell to SMBs if you aren&#x27;t helping them decrease costs or increase revenue, so the more you emphasize the practical implications of your software the better.<p>2) The homepage is a little sparse on details. If I owned a restaurant, I&#x27;d want to see at least a bunch of screenshots, if not an interactive demo. Telling me that the product gives me happier customers is fine,  but I really need to see what I&#x27;m going to be working on.<p>3) On the pricing page, a general tactic is to put real prices and see who clicks on which tiers. That way, you can see how many people would actually be willing to pay for your product and how many are just mildly interested.<p>4) When you get the emails, make sure you talk to them within a day. I&#x27;ve found that most potentially leads go down the toilet if you wait much longer, so you&#x27;re going to want to engage them while they&#x27;re interested.<p>Shoot me an email at the email on my profile if you want to talk more!",1382905612

The paper they use is pretty substandard which causes ink to dry slower than other paper and if you use fountain pens you have to contend with considerable amounts of feathering and bleed-through. Based on experience Clairefontaine paper seems to be far superior and their notebooks make for a cheaper option if you don&#x27;t need leather binding[0].

2) the goal graph only disappears if you click it -- you can bring it back with &quot;show goal&quot; (which is a command in your history when the level starts)
3) you can view just the objective again with &quot;objective&quot;
4) when the goal graph comes up, you can still type into the console. it just might be a hard to see the results of your commands (this is the biggest issue and I haven&#x27;t found a way to resolve it... :-/<p>Anyways, let me know if you have ideas on how to make the app more usable / newcomer friendly.

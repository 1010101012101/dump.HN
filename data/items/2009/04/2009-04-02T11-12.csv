The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.”

However, so far this seems fairly geographically limited.<p>At a business event last night I was chatting with some UK-based investors who would love to see the UK get more businesses off the ground, particularly Scotland. Yet there are very few schemes that do what YC does - fill the gap between idea and launch.<p>(Seedcamp isn't YC. I'm talking earlier than that.)<p>Does the UK need a YC? Something to give people cash and help while they realise their idea? Or are the existing schemes such as Dragon's Den, Seedcamp, Prince's Trust, university entrepreneurship clubs and other, harder-to-find governmental initiatives enough to cater for the very-very-early-stagers?<p>(If so, are they publicised enough? I'm on a YC-like scheme, only it runs for a year, called EPIS. Nobody seems to have heard of it, though. We're trying to fix that.)",1238672371

543176,comment,543155,543155,0,0,kiwidrew,,,"Summary:  HTTP pipelining isn't relevant any longer because we're all on broadband.  Because the server has to send out the responses in the order that the original requests were received, the server may need to buffer a response if it is ready before the previous responses have been sent.  Thus a malicious client could request a page which takes a long time to generate (e.g. a complex database query) followed by 99 other requests (as there is a limit of 100 requests in a single pipeline) and force the server to buffer the final 99 responses until the first request has completed.<p>Basically, the author rants about pipelining being useless 
(even though it's quite useful in practice, particularly when serving static content from a separate domain) and then tries to claim that a minor denial-of-service attack is a huge security risk and that this is justification for not using pipelining.",1238670816

543168,comment,543155,543155,0,0,cperciva,,,"The author doesn't understand HTTP pipelining, and is drawing completely incorrect conclusions as a result.<p>First, the fact that HTTP requests are pipelined <i>in the network</i> doesn't mean that HTTP requests have to be pipelined <i>in the server</i>.  HTTP server support for pipelining can be as simple as ""be aware that there may be more requests sitting in the receive buffer after the one we're currently reading"", and in most situations (where the time it takes to service a request is far less than internet RTT) this alone provides a huge speedup.<p>In fact, I'm not aware of <i>any</i> HTTP servers actually processing pipelined requests in parallel.<p>HTTP Pipelining is not intended to do anything to mitigate server request-handling latency.  It's all about cutting out network RTTs, and if you have to download hundreds of small files (e.g., small images on a web page) it does this very well.",1238670294

They want budget and schedule. Somebody has to pay for a system, and they can&#x27;t go to the hill and ask for &quot;some&quot; money. Agile acknowledges that you don&#x27;t know everything up front, but with that is the concomitant fact that you cannot give a budget and schedule. So, should the government hire me or you to do a job? Is it even worth paying for? And yes, am I executing on what I promised?<p>The results in messed up. We always strove, after winning, to write a rational requirements document that acknowledge the uncertainty. Most times they &#x27;got it&#x27; and accepted that sort of management style, but there were also times when you&#x27;d be tasked to do something utterly useless because of some &quot;shall&quot; in a requirements document that is now hopelessly out of date.

Some browsers may do certain things milliseconds faster, or more often be perceived to perform faster, but there is little practical difference besides confidentiality. (I realize this may be controversial to some, but I doubt choice of browser impacts most people&#x27;s productivity beyond confidentiality issues.)<p>2) Other browser vendors could not easily compete with Mozilla in the area of confidentiality: Their business models often include tracking consumer behavior, and their brands are not as trusted to put users first as a public interest organization is (and it depends on trust; consumers can&#x27;t verify these things themselves).<p>3) Other browser vendors would be forced to try to compete regardless and improve confidentiality, and awareness of and demand for confidentiality would be increased, furthering Mozilla&#x27;s missions. I think demand for confidentiality often is overlooked because consumers rarely have the opportunity to express it -- it&#x27;s hardly ever an option.<p>Regarding the features: Not all confidentiality features are suited for general use (e.g., NoScript), but many are and some could be options for more advanced users. For example, why isn&#x27;t there a Tor button or pref in Mozilla&#x27;s official Firefox releases, which connects to Tor and routes all traffic through it? IME, it works fine, though a little more slowly, for most purposes.<p>EDIT: A few additions and clarifications.",1409255179

8239260,comment,8238071,8238071,3,0,thinkpad20,,,"I&#x27;m curious how D implements memoizing an arbitrary function. To memoize something, you need to be able to check if it&#x27;s being called with the same arguments. But to do that, you need a definition of &quot;same&quot; (i.e., an equivalence relation). For example, if the argument is a dictionary, is it considered the same argument only if the pointer is the same, or if the keys and values are the same, assuming a recursive definition of &quot;same&quot;? Also, you need a way to store computed values, using the arguments as keys, which for efficiency would require either an ordering (for a tree) or hashing (for a hash table) on the arguments. Multiple arguments would further complicate things. How does this get automated? And for some things, memoization wouldn&#x27;t make sense (for example, with function arguments in higher-order functions). Sensible defaults would take care of most of these things, but it makes me wonder how they chose to address these things. And is the memo recreated each time the (outer) function is called, or is it stored for the duration of the program? Also, how does the type system play with this? What&#x27;s the type of `memoize!`?",1409254866

As in whenever you develop a new app or tool, it needs to roll out to a hundred thousand (or hundred million in the case of healthcare.gov) people and needs to integrate with dozens or even hundreds of different systems. Which of course, is the entire problem to begin with.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious that the old way of doing things is not sustainable. Most people would say the answer is Agile processes; but that has drawbacks in a government context. Agile can mean many things. Depending on how you implement it, but there is an inescapable trade-off of efficiency for oversight. Government contracts <i>need</i> oversight; otherwise you have contractors who aren&#x27;t meeting their obligations and collecting millions of dollars while throwing obviously unqualified people at a problem. Often nobody on the government side is even paying attention that the work isn&#x27;t getting done until it&#x27;s too late.<p>I really don&#x27;t know what the answer is here. There are lots of problems with the government procurement process, but there is a lot of money on the line and the people receiving it have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Ultimately the procurement process is the biggest issue. Contracts go to the company that can navigate the procurement process most effectively; not the company best suited to do the job. Given the bureaucratic nightmare that is government procurement, any procurement process designed to find the best company for the job will still ultimately reward the companies most adept at gaming the system through back channels (e.g. calling in a favor with a Congressman to ensure the criteria for contractor selection benefit a specific company).",1409254492

8239227,comment,8238542,8238873,1,0,mcphage,,,"> The point isn&#x27;t that the companies were or were not doing something wrong, it&#x27;s the opacity of the entire process--it&#x27;s almost Kafkaesque. The government accuses them of a crime, gets a payout, and everything gets settled hush-hush.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really true, though.  It&#x27;s more like &quot;the government accuses them of a crime, and then the company and the government come to a settlement.&quot;  For instance, look at the recent eBook price fixing matter.  The government accused 5 publishers and Apple of a crime.  The publishers agreed to a fine and business changes, but Apple refused to settle—and it went to court.  The fact that it went much more poorly for Apple through the court process shows why companies are so eager to settle.<p>Or to put it another way: it&#x27;s opaque from the outside.  From the inside, it&#x27;s all lawyers deciding what to settle for.<p>> No one knows what exactly about their conduct was illegal<p>I think the companies have a very good idea of what they did that the government disapproved of; companies don&#x27;t want to find out exactly the exact legal result, because they don&#x27;t want to actually be found guilty of a crime.<p>> how the fines are being used by the government.<p>That&#x27;s not really the business&#x27;s... well, business.  They don&#x27;t get to dictate that.<p><i></i>*<p>I agree with you that there should be more visibility in to these settlements, but more so companies can&#x27;t hide behind &quot;we weren&#x27;t actually found guilty of a crime&quot;.  But I don&#x27;t think companies want that kind of public visibility into their misdeeds.  With these secret settlements they can make problems just disappear.  And certainly, from the public standpoint, what exactly happens to these huge settlements needs to be more visible.",1409254457

8239076,comment,8237020,8237228,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"Like many things in the startup world, the investors are the men behind the curtain pulling the strings on these myths. They perpetuate this image that startups are staffed only by super tech geniuses and big companies are staffed only by incompetent, washed-up slackers who&#x27;ve given up on their dreams because they want to exploit the cheap, inexperienced labor pool of naive new college graduates who will work for something &quot;cool&quot; for almost no money. Once you grow up and get a wife, kids, and mortgage, it isn&#x27;t so important to work for the &quot;cool&quot; kids anymore.<p>There is a great wealth of expertise and mentorship that is missing in the startup world because investors throw a bunch of college kids together, tell them they&#x27;re the coolest guys around, and pay them a pittance. If investors were a little more willing to offer a real salary to a person with the self-respect to demand at least market rates and reasonable working hours, I think we&#x27;d all be in a better place.",1409252615

3128082,comment,3118620,3124779,1,0,kragen,,,"I'm sure you know enormously more than I do about <i>how to do</i> dense-array number crunching.  My claim, though, is that it's being applied much more widely than previously, not that there are new and better ways of doing it; so there are fewer and fewer places where such concerns are not important.<p>In the 1960s, there were those who claimed that the benefit of recursion was not worth the complexity it added to programming languages, except in certain special domains.  In the 1970s and 1980s, we had the same argument about depth-first search  SNOBOL's and Prolog's backtracking feature.  It turned out that the proponents of recursion were right, and the proponents of backtracking were probably wrong.  (Although the backtracking feature of SNOBOL's child Icon directly inspired Python's generators, although implementationally they're maybe more similar to CLU iterators.)<p>Now, when it comes to matrix and vector manipulation, should we imagine it as a single domain, or as a feature that's useful across a wide range of domains?<p>I'm arguing for the latter.",1318985906

    makeChange amount = loop 0 [200, 100, 25, 10, 5, 1] []
        where loop total coins@(c:cs) solution

3128014,comment,3127697,3127697,25,0,ilamont,,,"Nintendo is an interesting case that may dispel some of the stereotypes about Japanese companies and management styles.<p>First, the company is quite old (1889, I believe). It started out manufacturing playing cards, yet had a pretty remarkable evolution after its post-war CEO (a member of the founding family, surnamed Yamauchi) took over. While it was a top-down organization, Yamauchi recognized and encouraged some out-of-the box and risky thinking. The company at one point was invested in things like hotels and food, but started to develop a new business in the 1970s around video games. Keep in mind that in 1977 video games were not nearly as popular as they are now, and the nearest product line Nintendo had at the time was toys. Famicom/NES was launched in the mid 1980s, at a time when the videogame market was in a slump (this was post-Atari 2600). It turned out to be a massive hit, that really kept Nintendo on top of the console market until Sony came out with the PlayStation.<p>The Wii is another example of an innovative approach to product design. It was not designed by focus groups, as the company was worried about leaks. Rather, the design of the console and controller came from an internal group made up mostly of career Nintendo engineers like Shigeru Miyamoto (of Mario Bros. fame). Yamauchi's successor, Satoru Iwata (himself a former game developer) was also on the team. They recognized that they couldn't win the hardware arms race with Sony and Microsoft, a race that focused on specs and pleasing hardcore gamers. They thought of a different set of users, and not only kids and senior citizens waving around a Wiimote. The team even considered how housewives would react to a new console in the living room, and therefore designed a box that was sleek and stylish, and not much bigger than a stack of DVD boxes.<p>There's a great interview series with the Wii design team, called ""Iwata asks"". It talks about many of the issues they had to overcome, and the prototyping process. It was published on Nintendo websites all over the world -- I think Iwata wanted to do a little victory lap, and get on record how they came up with the brilliant ideas behind the Wii.

Do you regularly think of how you can improve existing tools and technology for testing? The QA Team at Yodle is responsible for understanding the vision of the business and then creating test systems and using them to deliver that vision. This means developing systems that behave like end users, are thorough like testers, and interface like developers. You will be rewarded by developing your business acumen, your development and design chops, and your leadership skills.<p>Responsibilities<p><pre><code>		Dedicate yourself to understanding the business and services we provide. Learning is done by getting up and speaking with your users, talking with our product managers, and doing some research of your own. Yodler's wear out the treads on our shoes twice as fast as normal worker because we believe passive forms of communication (emails, voicemails) are detrimental to our success. 

	Deliver consistent and sound test strategy. At Yodle, we strive to find the balance between ""going with your gut"" and ""analysis paralysis"". Engineers are responsible for envisioning the work from beginning to end and then executing on the plan. Work will present challenges in the areas of web applications, backend services, mobile devices, and many other areas/fields. 
	
	Commit to working in a tightly integrated engineering team. At Yodle, QA Engineers work side by side with product developers, product managers, and UI designers. If you are the type of person who asks to included in up front decisions, but then feels overwhelmed, Yodle is not a good fit. You will be asked to think critically about your own work and about everyone else's work - regardless of their department. Quality is everyone's responsibility, but you are its champion - both in practice and by example.  

	Contribute to a growing test system that needs to constantly evolve and expand in order to allow our products to evolve and expand. Use your knowledge of software development and testing to create a system that validates our products while maximizing reliability, specificity, and speed. Use your experience in concert with development to answer the all important question of ""What do I need to get started?""

They don't know how to design software, or hardware, and they damned sure don't know how it works either. But they sure as hell know that if your product would ""just"" do this one little thing it would help them out.<p>The problem, of course, is that you then end up delegating design to people who lack the expertise. You can end up implementing ridiculous features if you just implement suggestions uncritically. For example, if you sell a sports car that people think should be more powerful they could express that by saying it should have a bigger engine, even though there are many ways to approach that problem (EFI programming, turbo chargers, lighter frame, different gear box, etc.) If you end up doing this a lot you end up with a big ball of mud design-wise as everyone's disparate needs and half-thought-out solutions collides with each other.<p>It takes a lot of effort to take the needs of customers and distill it down into a core set of functions and then tie those functions together in an elegant manner in a cohesive and highly useful design.<p>If you look at a lot of the ""also ran"" products from any given genre you will notice a trend towards a chaotic implementation of a laundry list of features whereas the market leaders tend to present a more elegant and cohesive design, even sometimes at the expensive of a handful of features.",1318982729

Yes, people can and do conspire behind the scenes whether it's illegal or not. Yes, insider trading occurs. Yes, certain actors have many orders of magnitude more money under their control than others. And yes there is now a much higher volume of computerized trading than in decades past, with more complexity, more abstraction, and more layers of indirection. It's like running a shell game against a mark, except you're now able to maintain thousands of shells under which to hide the nut as you move it around. And move them at extremely high speeds. If you plan a con or scam or ""raid"" but construct it well enough to cover your trail, have plausible deniability, and/or not do anything which is strictly illegal (and if you have millions or especially billions of dollars at your disposal, you almost certainly can afford to have many great lawyers helping you to ensure that this is the case), then it seems reasonable to assume that one can get away with the white-collar equivalent of a bank robbery.",1324538538

""Confidential Information.<p>5.1 Obligations. Each party will: (a) protect the other partys Confidential Information with the same standard of care it uses to protect its own Confidential Information; and (b) not disclose the Confidential Information, except to Affiliates, employees and agents who need to know it and who have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. Each party (and any Affiliates, employees and agents to whom it has disclosed Confidential Information) may use Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, while using reasonable care to protect it. Each party is responsible for any actions of its Affiliates, employees and agents in violation of this Section.<p>5.2 Exceptions. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) the recipient of the Confidential Information already knew; (b) becomes public through no fault of the recipient; (c) was independently developed by the recipient; or (d) was rightfully given to the recipient by another party. ""<p>It sounds like what Google is really saying is, ""If we make some kind of secret deal with your organization, you better protect that secrecy as well as you protect all of your confidential information, or there is no limit to how much we can sue you for the breach.""",1324538435

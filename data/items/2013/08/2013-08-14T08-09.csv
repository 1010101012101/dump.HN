6210476,comment,6205584,6206683,1,0,oleganza,,,"Here are ways people are made less poor with Bitcoin:<p>1. Sending money over the border to relatives for 0 fee. There are a lot of stories on how people risk their wealth transferring big amounts of hard earned capital across the border.<p>2. Do not have to pay hidden costs of using traditional payment systems. Costs are for sellers and buyers: 1) transaction fees 2) fraud risk 3) undersupply of goods because of fraud risk or fees. Tons of business models are simply not possible without Bitcoin. And many are not open to anyone in the world because of regulations, fraud risk etc.<p>3. No cost of inflation. If you save money for buying something expensive or opening your own shop, central bank steals your wealth by printing money and giving it to privileged organisations (that are supposed to pay you back in a form of &quot;growing economy&quot;, but we have yet to see a proof for it). For almost 5 years now, Bitcoin value was significantly growing every single year, comparing to any other asset on the market. And even when/if it stops growing, the value of Bitcoin depends on a decision of every market participant, not a small group of people in the Federal Reserve.<p>4. Those who wish to save wealth by avoiding some taxation, are able to do so. If some poor teenager learns HTML and makes websites for Bitcoin, he doesn&#x27;t need to lose 20-50% of his income (depending on your country and how you measure the total tax).<p>5. If you worry about gangsters from main street or wall street stealing your money by force, you can hide it well <i>extremely</i> cheaply. You can remember a single password to re-create a wallet from it. Or back up your wallet on different cloud services. Or give copies to all your friends. It&#x27;s much easier to protect bitcoins than gold or paper bills. We only need some easy to use software, but it&#x27;s entirely possible to do, it just takes some time.<p>The only cost for you is higher perceived uncertainty (however, our shaky financial ponzi scheme created by government only seems stable, but it can collapse anytime and goes in that direction) and a lack of tools and services. But all of that is coming. Every year it becomes easier to use Bitcoin and more people accept them.<p>See where the puck is going.",1376469525

If they&#x27;ve chosen to make their product a certain way, it&#x27;s probably for a real reason.  If your marketing implies that they&#x27;re stupid, people will assume that you can&#x27;t see <i>their</i> real reason, and assume that you&#x27;re stupid.  It&#x27;s better to phrase things in terms of trade-offs instead, and let your market decide whether the trade-offs you&#x27;ve made are more appropriate for their use-case than the trade-offs your competitors have made.<p>For an example from a project I just released:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6209908"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6209908</a><p>(Incidentally, almost all the comments on Gumbo were of the vein of &quot;Why should I use this?&quot; until I started making replies like this, saying &quot;Here&#x27;s what html5lib does, here&#x27;s why they made the choices they did, and here&#x27;s how Gumbo differs from those choices.  Here&#x27;s what validator.nu does, here&#x27;s why they made the choices they did, and here&#x27;s how Gumbo differs.  Here&#x27;s what Hubbub does, here&#x27;s why they made the choices they did, and here&#x27;s how Gumbo differs.&quot;",1376467445

Slava responded to my comment arguing for the merits of Tarsnap augmenting the human condition instead of saying it&#x27;s not a startup.<p>That&#x27;s not to say your rebuttal isn&#x27;t valid, but that I think there&#x27;s confusion of what really constitutes a startup. Was Instapaper a startup? It sold for an exit, but on the face of it I don&#x27;t see how it inherently scales differently from something like Tarsnap.<p>I would define any budding tech company as a startup, though it might not be accepted by VC&#x27;s or Y-Combinator because it couldn&#x27;t scale. That&#x27;s my own opinion.",1376467444

From my point of view, it&#x27;s also a good source of questions for an employee to ask the founders when interviewing at a startup .<p>I don&#x27;t get this, though:<p>> <i>Watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi, then do marketing that way. Pick a small set of tasks, do them consistently, and get better every day.</i><p>How is that marketing? That&#x27;s getting good at your craft and improving your product.<p>I watched the movie, but I&#x27;m not sure that Jiro is good at marketing.  Apparently he&#x27;s very good at making sushi, but it seems he became successful (and later world famous) despite being bad at marketing.<p>Incidentally, his shop&#x27;s average ratings at Tabelog (one of the biggest Japanese gourmet websites) is only 3.8 out of 5, with quite a few &quot;bad&quot; reviews.",1376467368

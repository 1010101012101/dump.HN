5347262,comment,5346182,5346634,3,0,aedun,,,"It's actually a lot more complicated than that. This is going to be an oversimplified explanation.<p>To understand the situation, you have to identify all the players in a credit card transaction and the risk each take.<p>In a typical credit card transaction, there are usually six participants (Might be less, if say 4 and 5 are the same entity):<p>1) The Customer<p>2) The Issuing bank (The bank that backs the credit card the customer uses)<p>3) The network (Mastercard, VISA, Amex, Discover, etc.)<p>4) The Payment Processor (Chase Paymentech, etc.)<p>5) The Acquiring bank (The merchant's bank)<p>and lastly,<p>6) The merchant<p>Everyone sandwiched between the customer and the merchant takes on various risk and each takes a cut of the transaction.<p>The details are complicated and most of it covered with private business agreements.<p>Most people think that most of the fees go to VISA, Mastercard, etc. But this is incorrect.<p>Let's start with the issuing bank. If you have a Chase credit card, the issuing bank would be Chase. In credit card transactions, they usually take most (~60-80%) of the transaction fee. Why? Because they take on the risk of offering the customer a line of credit. The customer could default on payment, the card could be fraudulently used, etc. In addition to taking a big cut of the transaction, they also charge the customer interest on credit not paid back in full.<p>Next you have the network. They operate the network that binds all the banks together. They also take a cut of the fees.<p>Next you have the payment processor. They are responsible for verifying and checking payment details received by the merchant from the customer. They might also operate point of sale systems if it is a physical transaction. In either case, they make sure the transaction goes smoothly and the merchant is protected.<p>So finally, you have the acquiring bank. They are the bank the merchant uses to get paid. They also get a cut of the fees. Why? Because they take on the risk of the merchant's business. If charge backs happen often enough, the acquiring bank is fined by the network. This fine usually gets passed to the merchant by the acquiring bank, as in the case here.<p>So generally, the interest the customer pays goes to the issuing bank, the transaction fee is paid by the merchant, which is usually split between four entities, with the issuing bank taking the by far the biggest cut.<p>So why is this complicated system needed?<p>Simply because banks don't trust its customers and banks don't trust other banks. Everyone takes on risk and demands to be compensated for it. Think of all the thousands of banks in the world. They all do business differently, and they might not trust each other. The network provides the glue that binds them together, and the fees allows banks to take on the risk of doing business.<p>What about alternatives?<p>What if you want to cut out the middlemen? What if the merchant wants to deal with the customer directly? If you are a bigger company, this is indeed possible with 'store cards'. You are basically providing line of credit directly to the customer.<p>Yes, you skip paying fees to the banks and the network. However, you take on the big risk of providing customer credit. They can default, credit be used fraudulently, etc. Additionally, you would need underwriters to do credit checks on potential clients. This both impacts the customer's credit score and extra hoop to jump to purchase something on credit. Since the transaction fee is transparent to the customer for credit card transactions, you would need to provide incentive to the customer to jump through the hoop. This is usually done through attractive financing terms, gifts, rewards etc.<p>What about debit cards? There's still fees to the merchant because there is still risk involved in the process. Yes, the customer is not buying on credit, but all other risks are still present. Additionally, there is also infrastructure cost that must be compensated. From the merchant point of view, if customers are restricted by how much money they have presently, they might be less likely to make a purchase, resulting in lost sale.<p>So what about cash? That's surely perfect, right? No transaction fees?<p>This is not entirely true. If you operate a large retail company, you have tens and hundreds of stores that end up with thousands of dollars of cash at the end of the day. Where does the cash go? How does it get to the bank? For larger businesses, this usually means hiring a security company to transport the money. This results in significant cost to your business just to handle cash.<p>But what about small businesses that handles small amount of cash themselves? You still risk losing or getting the cash stolen, not to mention the possibility of the cash being counterfeit.<p>Lastly, cash is hard to use as a currency online.<p>Now i feel like i am mumbling and might have made some mistakes. In no way am i defending banks and various financial institutions, all i want to say is that handling payment is risky and hard and the existing infrastructure and fees for a reason.<p>Could it be better? Absolutely.",1362801389

The plaintiffs in the case couldn't even prove that they had been harmed!<p>Seems very sensible, compared to how difficult the search for a plaintiff with standing had been for the case that became Heller. If a civil rights activist (Parker) that received death threats had no standing to challenge DC's handgun ban, as he never tried to register a handgun (unlike Heller, who was arguably a less sympathetic defendant -- an anti-government ""gun-nut"", etc...), I don't see how Amnesty had standing in this case.<p>Second amendment is actually a great example of how poor plaintiff choice often hurts civil rights causes.

Hell, why are you wasting time on a family? Think of all the Ruby books you could have read.<p>Except, in addition to being pleasurable, media shapes our society and culture. That we do more than just working to survive is perhaps one of humanity's defining features, and we <i>should</i> be embracing it. Video games are similar to books or film, in that they have dramatically influenced many of our minds and lives. That's why we get upset when publishers see our obsession and game merely as something to exploit for profit, then throw away, rather than as something that should be preserved as part of society's collective knowledge. Even if the DRM probably won't directly cause us any problems ever, it makes us uncomfortable. I noticed when playing the latest release of Metal Gear Solid, how significant the series has been to me.<p>When I played MG/MGS1, I was young - and, among other games, shared controller gameplay was a bonding experience between me and my friends. These friends are still my strongest, so no doubt it helped cement the friendship. MGS2 was when I was about 10, and starting to think somewhat philosophically. The ideas about AI and censorship, trans-humanism, robotics and nanotechnology significantly changed me and perhaps shaped my beliefs and future (in combination with films like The Matrix which I watched at the same time). MGS3, I played with my girlfriend when we first met - and even now we still talk about it, and have played it a few times since. I played MGS4 relatively recently, now moved out, living with girlfriend and working. That video game series, however, has been there, influencing my life in various ways from the sidelines - and that's just one video game out of hundreds I've played over the years. I remember when playing Sega Megadrive games when I was very young, trying to work out how they were made. It perhaps is when I started to get interested in programming.<p>Sure, you shouldn't be playing them all day every day - but that's just the age old problem of procrastination, living a balanced life and work before play. If you go too far down this path of maximum productivity, you start to burn out.

Yes, absolutely.<p>It's against the law to fire a woman because she is pregnant. I strongly agree that firing someone on that basis is a form of sexual discrimination.

Should women be subordinate to their husbands? Should it be okay to prohibit women from school athletic competition? Should women be allowed to drive?

That's absurd.<p>> objectification means ""denial of autonomy, inertness."" / That's clearly NOT what it means in the mind of most people<p>I pulled that quote from Wikipedia.

This is quite different than what a scientist or mathematician calls a ""theory."" When talking about scientific research, should we use the general definition, or the specialized one? When doing media analysis, should we use the terms from that field or create new ones?<p>Since the term from feminist analysis is that of philosophy/ethics, where's it's been in used for over 200 years (eg, Kant's ""Lectures on Ethics"" says objectification 'involves the lowering of a person, a being with humanity, to the status of an object' <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-objectification/</a> ), and since the use of the term 'objectification' in popular culture arises from this same source, I see no reason to avoid using the correct and appropriate term.<p>> the relevance of the genders is not given by the players but by outsiders<p>Ahh, since you reject the underlying concept that media (books, movies, newspapers, advertisements, video games, etc.) affects the way insiders think and perceive the world, then of course you reject any sort of media analysis as irrelevant. I think you are quite wrong in that viewpoint.<p>I also don't understand your insider/outsider distinction, so if you would, please elaborate. Also, I would appreciate if you could tell me where the quote ""Is not about women at all!"" comes from, as I don't see it in the transcript nor our earlier discussion.

I inferred from that that the presentation was examining the damsel in distress trope only, and not the larger set of topics that the series is about.<p>The episode's home page at <a href=""http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/03/damsel-in-distress-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/03/damsel-in-distress-...</a> says ""This video explores how the Damsel in Distress became one of the most widely used gendered clich in the history of gaming and why the trope has been core to the popularization and development of the medium itself.""<p>This concurs with my view that this episode examines the damsel in distress trope, and not wider issues of sexism in gaming, even though you say it does. How do you draw your conclusion?<p>Where does the presentation ""[victimize] women for the lack of their presence in video-games""? I can't respond to your reference to 'proverbial quotations' because I can't figure out what you are talking about.

What does ""provincial quote"" mean?<p>The quote, btw, seems to be from Jonathan McIntosh on Twitter as @radicalbytes, 11 Aug 2012. I think it's quite a powerful and descriptive quote, and quite appropriate for its context. It doesn't talk about the games industry, but serves to emphasize how Princess Peach can be viewed as an object in the Mario franchise, as she's passed back and forth between Mario and Bowser.<p>> Dinosaur Planet was transformed to a StarFox game because it makes so much business sense but unsurprisingly she didn't mention this _extremely_ obvious fact<p>No? The logical implication was clear to me.<p>Between 1:50 and 2:12, we learn that Dinosaur Planet was revamped to use the 'damsel in distress' trope.<p>At 12:03: ""The trope quickly became the go-to motivational hook for developers as it provided an easy way to tap into adolescent male power fantasies in order to sell more games to young straight boys and men.""<p>The obvious implication is that Dinosaur Planet was likely changed in order to sell more games. This sounds very much like saying that it was transformed into a StarFox game for business reasons. Do you not make the same inference? Why not?<p>Moreover, the presenter argues that the reason it makes business sense is because it ""[taps] into adolescent male power fantasies"", while you fail to describe any alternative reason for why it makes business sense.<p>> ""Why is the main character of such violent video-game a woman? Such violent behavior is a thing of men"". That means they don't want more presence in video-games, they want presence in very specific videogames where ""she"" should be undoubtedly good.<p>What the fuck? Violent behavior is a 'thing of man'? Women are only supposed to be 'undoubtedly good'? What kind of world do you want to live in where that should be considered normal? Let me wake up my wife, the ex-soldier who served two tours of duty in Iraq, so she can laugh at you. (On second thought, no. She doesn't like being woken up.)<p>Your view is that gaming companies should produce games that people buy. That's a reasonable first-order solution. However, the market is notoriously amoral. The games market is at a rough equilibrium. Girls will play both ""girl games"" and ""boy games"". Boys will mostly only play ""boy games."" Therefore, the market is bigger for ""boy games."" That's perfectly obvious.<p>As a result, the original Master Chief model was bulked up because it looked 'too slender', ""almost effeminate"". His face is never shown because 'Bungie says this helps the gamer fully assume his character'. But surely there's no essential in-game requirement that (cybernetically enhanced, genetically special) Master Chief could not have been a woman. No, these tweaks were made to appeal to the market.<p>The question is, as a culture, should we encourage market partitioning based on sex and gender roles, ignore it, or minimize it, and what are the likely effects of that decision? This is a question of market, not market.<p>And this presentation addresses that question.",1362799055

Having done the program myself, you learn math you will never use* and ton of other things that can be counted as useless, however I am better for it. Calculus taught me less about how to do Calculus (I don't remember how to do an integral, but I don't get paid to do that), but it did teach me how to study properly and that grinding (hard work) really can solve some issues you have. Discrete Mathematics taught me to look deeper into things, and not just observe the first thing you see as the conclusion. Overall, I went into Computer Science wanting to learn how to program and left not learning how to code from the program (I worked full time as a software engineer through school) but I learned valuable skills that have helped me get where I am today. If you are thinking about not going to college (college is not for everyone*), I suggest you do.

There is nothing super inherent with many documents that are currently emailed around as whole atomic units that they wouldn't be better represented as plain text.  And git ALREADY handles plain text really well.  It handles emailing diffs and applying changes from email.  It is robust enough to not cause fear of using the tool for with it might do to the text.  People are married their MS Office based workflow, and they will always find an excuse to maintain it.  Migrating the individual components to a different platform (MS Office to ODF) is a valid way to challenge the status quo, and it's just as valid to challenge it by revisiting the assumptions that enforce the status quo (that you need to email diffs or documents around, for example; that can be challenged with on-line, simultaneous, collaborative editing -- which removes the need to email diffs around).

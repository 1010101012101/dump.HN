Another great example here would be the NSL of Lavabit - how they asked for far more than was legally obligated and the forcefulness and non-public nature of the demands made it impossible to put forward a reasonable defense.<p>To summarize it is apparent to me that the difference in our perspectives is whether a specific law (another being proposed again now, as you point out) is required in the current climate of practice of law, along with the leverage and the compliance requirements that exist inside it, for key escrow to be &#x27;required of companies&#x27;.<p>I come down on the side of &#x27;no&#x27;. I believe they have what they need now to get escrow.<p>Maybe this Apple and Google thing will clarify it. But somehow I doubt it.

What actionable information is contained in that choice? I can&#x27;t see any. Nor (one hopes) does it express their <i>desired</i> outcome.<p>Statements like &quot;Ebola <i>could</i> mutate...&quot; appear to me to be some kind of verbal reassurance behaviour. From this I infer that they are motivated primarily by fear, and one of the things fear does in social primates is--rather like a virus--spread itself. About which I will now proceed to speculate in an unfortunately data-free way.<p>People are hierarchical animals, and when we&#x27;re afraid we feel better if we&#x27;re not <i>as</i> afraid as everyone else, so we tend to do and say things that will raise alarm in others. Being afraid lowers one&#x27;s status in the group (and lower status often leads to more fear). There are two ways of dealing with this: reducing one&#x27;s own fear, or increasing fear in others. Again, this is purely speculative: I&#x27;ve searched around a bit but can&#x27;t find any research that bears directly on this question. It would be interesting to see it investigated, and relatively straightforward to do.<p>So &quot;Keep Calm and Carry On&quot; is a good motto to have. It helps us focus on maintaining our place in the monkey hierarchy by controlling our own fear, rather inducing fear in others. And given how frequently fear runs out of control and leads to uncivil behaviour, this seems like a desirable result.",1413182911

It shows prices being adjusted when things happen on other markets.<p>The test is can I put a single order in to hit a price being shown on <i>one</i> <i>single</i> <i>market</i> and consistently miss when nothing else is going on. Because that really is fraud. This just plain isn&#x27;t. This is taking info from another market and updating your price as fast as possible so you don&#x27;t get arb&#x27;d as a market maker.<p>Why is the test one single market? Because if you&#x27;re transacting a very large, (ie market moving) qty for something on multiple markets you&#x27;d expect that information to move the other markets where that instrument is being quoted. So now it&#x27;s just that market makers are set up to deal with info from the other markets really fast. Maybe their link from one exchange to the next is faster than your link to the second exchange. That&#x27;s clearly what is happening here. This is incredibly competitive nature of quoting really, really tight. You can&#x27;t do it otherwise, you have to be wider. This is also falls under the normal definitions of efficient market hypothesis.<p>Note these guys who are complaining still get better prices for their market moving qty than they would get in the absence of HFT. That is with no HFT they could successfully transact all their volume at a much worse quoted price on all those markets and their investors are worse off. Effectively the worst price they get as the market moves with their big trade as they execute at multiple prices would be the best price anyone would ever show in the absence of HFT.<p>But hey if you&#x27;re sucking as a funds manager while charging a fee that is a wealth tax in excess of 1% per annum of total wealth you&#x27;ve got to blame something, right? Short sellers are a popular one too despite being the basically only counter-mechanism we have for bubble inflated asset prices. And if you&#x27;re a broker, some nerds cut your lunch, make them stop with their superior skills, dammit.<p>The width of the spread you actually get is the only thing that matters, but there is a mountain of BS fearmongering to divert your attention.

8447721,comment,8446932,8447472,0,0,dperfect,,,"There are two categories of artifacts caused by rolling shutter: those from objects moving in the scene (such as the propeller in this example), and those that result from movement of the camera relative to the scene (especially pans, tilts, dolly movements, etc).<p>Those caused by camera movement (often resulting in an image that looks skewed) are somewhat easier to &quot;fix&quot; as you say with post processing since a correcting transformation can sometimes be applied to the entire image uniformly. Existing tools can do this with some success, but there are still some camera moves that prove to be more difficult (zooms, irregular movement, etc).<p>Artifacts caused by objects moving in the scene are often much more difficult to remove, at least when it comes to providing a generic solution, because &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the image requires fairly accurate information as to how those objects were moving. In the case of the rotating prop or wheel, it may be somewhat simple (the algorithm would still probably require user input of things like the center of rotation and speed), but in other cases, the motion may be quite complex (e.g., multiple wheels rotating in different directions/speeds, linear vs angular motion, etc). And that doesn&#x27;t even account for the fact that in most cases, there will be occlusion in the source image from artifacts of the rolling shutter. That is, in the propeller example, you have patches of the background that are covered up in the source, but wouldn&#x27;t be in a &quot;fixed&quot; image, so they need to be filled somehow.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that sophisticated software may be able to do a lot in helping to correct for rolling shutter artifacts, but I don&#x27;t think there will be an automatic, fix-all solution from post processing software any time soon.",1413182716

2516974,comment,2516830,2516897,12,0,vidarh,,,"The ""one-representative-per-constituency"" link doesn't mean much to those of us who end up getting ""represented"" by a parliament where <i>none</i> of the elected MP's have views remotely like our own because our views are uncommon enough in every constituency. That's what gets me about this debate: Ultimately it is about whether or not you keep disenfranchising those who do not agree with the larger parties.<p>AV will help somewhat in the long term, as people are more free to vote for the smaller parties without quite the same risk of losing seats for the lesser evil of the large parties, but it will still leave a substantial number of people without <i>any</i> meaningful representation.<p>I'm originally from Norway, and I much prefer the Norwegian system: PR with multi-seat constituencies where each constituency is a reasonably small geographical region, combined with a small number of seats that are allocated in order to more closely approximate the countrywide vote totals amongst the parties that got more than 4% of the vote (personally I think the 4% limit ought to go too).<p>It maintains a regional link, while at the same time getting a far more accurate representation of how people vote.<p>I support AV over FPTP because it will force the larger parties to be somewhat more mindful of other voters and because it may allow some opposition parties to grow faster because of less tactical voting, but whatever the result, I will still be without anyone representing my interests.",1304596603

Often an idea persistently fails until someone finally does them right and then it doesn't fail anymore. One example is document synchronization; people justified the consistent failure of synchronization solutions with all sorts of explanations (including the ""people just don't need it"" joker card) until Dropbox came along, did it right, and now synchronization suddenly doesn't seem to be a ""dead on arrival"" idea. There are plenty of other examples.<p>It's easy to justify the failure of a product or solution by blaming the circumstances, like the ""market not being ready"" or ""people don't need it"" or ""the market is too small"" etc. Often, it's just that the product sucks, which might or might not be the fault of the creators.<p>TL;DR: Ideas only keep failing until someone does them right.",1304596234

My experience would convince me to advise that you should work were you want to work, but in general my experience is:<p>1) if money is the prime motivator, work for investment banks, preferably as a contractor;
2) if you want a breadth of experience, work in a good web design agency;
3) if deep domain knowledge is what you want, work in a startup.<p>(Of course, you can't do the contracting without a few years experience in any of the above.)<p>The points are all a generalisation but this final one is not, it's not what you are doing, how much you are getting paid or where you are doing it, it's who you are doing it with. The human factor is, in the long run, the most important thing. Are they smart? Good, you'll get smart too. Are the decent human beings? Good, you'll live a long life.<p>Humans: the cause of, and solution to, all life's problems :)",1304594987

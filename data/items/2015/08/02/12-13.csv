9990557,comment,9987679,9987679,0,0,tenfingers,,,"USENET, was in my opinion, one of the best features/protocol of the initial internet. I loved USENET ever since I discovered it (91/92) and I still use today a news reader through gmane, looking down at forums (just like this one) like a <i>sad</i> evolution.<p>Having an USENET server provided by your ISP used to be a <i>standard</i> part of the package. They would probably not carry alt.bin, but in the end it didn&#x27;t matter.<p>A truly P2P, <i>open</i>, messaging network, of the likes that you&#x27;ll never see developed again due to commercial exploitation. USENET had &quot;flaws&quot;, but honestly they&#x27;re minor.<p>The store and forward protocol required quite some disk space at the time. This resulted in several nodes to drop bin/alt.bin from the network (which in my opinion was always a hack providing nothing really useful, with yencoding/par and the like). But by today standards, you could probably run a node carrying the entire network with just maybe a bit more than regular consumer hardware, since it&#x27;s just text in the end, and the server is <i>very</i> simple: I used to run one server locally just for me.<p>How big a today&#x27;s network could be?\nSee for yourself: <a href=""http://gmane.org/stats.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmane.org/stats.php</a>\nOr: not big for any ISP to carry in full with just one sysadmin.<p>The network relied on &quot;control&quot; messages to create/delete groups automatically (as opposed to manual subscription), which due to the lack of authentication/encryption in the protocol, were very easy to spoof. A gpg-signing mechanism was later put into place, so that nodes peering with each other could establish a chain of trust by themselves. This was pretty nice in retrospect (and awesome by today standards), but the main problem is that creating new groups was a slow and painful approval-based process: people often wanted small groups just for themselves, and mailing lists offered the &quot;same&quot; without any approval required.<p>Having a large open network started to become a big attractor for SPAM, and managing SPAM in a P2P network without authentication is a harder problem to solve than a locally managed mailing list. For the same reason, trolls could be a nuisance at time.<p><i>Some</i> people claim that USENET became 1) too big 2) a receptacle for copyright infringement. Both claims are bullshit: by excluding binary groups (which was <i>ubiquitous</i> by 91/92 when I joined already), the network started in a consistent volume decline already in the late 90ies, so it <i>cannot</i> be that hosting a node in 1998 became impossible in 2005.<p>Here&#x27;s what happened: running a local server became so easy and cheap, that running mailing list offered local control and almost zero overhead. People that had niche groups started to create mailing lists with open access, and people migrated in flock. Why share your discussions in comp.programming.functional where you could create a mailing list just for your new fancy language? (it&#x27;s pretty sad, because I <i>loved</i> the breadth of the discussions).<p>Discussions on general groups became less frequent as most of the interesting ones were on dedicated mailing lists. The trend worsened significantly as forums started to appear, which lowered the barrier to entry to people that didn&#x27;t know how to use a mail client properly.<p>The sad truth is that now most of the general discussions aren&#x27;t openly shared anymore, and happen either on local websites (like this) or local mailing lists.<p>I&#x27;ve been using gmane.org to subscribe all open-access lists that I ever participated into. Most of the time, the list I&#x27;m looking for is already there.<p>In a certain sense, gmane.org offers the best of NNTP with the best of mailing lists: you can create your own lists without approval processes, and you can read any other list without having 1) to subscribe directly 2) having to store messages locally 3) see instantly the archive [as far as retention goes]. The mailing list administrator has still ultimate veto on what goes on the list, so that local authority is never undermined. On the other hand, NNTP clients are <i>built</i> to read massive volumes of messages, that would make reading reddit a breeze.<p>What gmane.org lacks though is the peering. One of the central NNTP features of the time was definitely killed.",1438519330

In reality, it&#x27;s not about unit vs functional, it seems to be about scope. E.g. If you have behavior that can&#x27;t be tested without doing a full manual integration test, then that&#x27;s where you need to start. Automate it and start to push back the layers until you get to functional, until you get to unit.<p>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with applying code coverage to integration test since it gives testers insight into whether they are testing the code at hand vs internals of other integrated systems (this difficulty is likely what keeps many from trying such testing).<p>But yes, these methods take a lot of time that we don&#x27;t have.<p>The other approach I&#x27;ve been leaning towards is static code-flow analysis, which can also be difficult (esp. in distributed web applications).",1438519302

You want non-repudiability in transactions: a given user owns their posts or cancel messages and can be linked to them. So, use a blockchain-based solution for authentication. (Not bitcoin; a separate non-financialized system.)<p>2. Instead of local spools consisting of a directory tree and sync&#x27;d via flood-fill, implement it as a virtual filesystem, peer-to-peer discovery, locally requested contents are cached, so high-traffic newsgroups will be cached more widely and therefore be faster to load.<p>3. Anti-spam: a big problem is preventing spammers sprouting new sock-puppet identities to get around already-imposed blocks. Hence non-repudiability. I&#x27;m not sure how to go about enforcing limits on sock-puppeting: this is a hard problem. But if the authentication mechanism is blockchain based we might be able to link it to an underlying funding system  and thereby impose a monetary cost on posting -- even $0.01 per message should be enough to put a drag-brake on spamming.

To test it, this site has a useful model of an electrical distribution network. There is a little bit of math ahead, which I only include because I think some readers will like it.<p>Following the diagram and the text below it, Ohio Edison operates 5757MW of electrical power generation (let’s call it 6000MW). The source voltage is 18kV; this gives 300,000A of current in the generating facilities (rounding for convenience).<p>The ratio of the step-up transformer to the transmission line is 350/18, which we’ll call 20. This means that the current in the transmission line is 300,000/20, or 15,000A. Current is stepped down in this manner in order to minimize transmission losses, but they cannot be eliminated.<p>In order to calculate the transmission losses, we’ll assume that the transmission cable used for this application has a resistance of around 0.1 Ohms per km of length. This is at the low end of the range (so the loss estimate will be low) according to a couple of spec sheets I looked at.<p>This yields (P=I^2R) 22.5MW lost power per km of length, or 0.4% per km. That’s 0.6% per mile, or 10% of the total energy lost over a transmission distance of just 18 miles. After 115 miles, only 50% of the power remains.",1438518691

It&#x27;s incredibly common among people and it seriously infects thinking, to the point some seem to believe objects have little tags attached to atoms that say &quot;this can be used only for X&quot;, and they&#x27;ll act as if you&#x27;re breaking the laws of nature if you use the object for something else than its &quot;intended purpose&quot;.<p>Current society itself also seems to encourage functional fixedness. Whenever there&#x27;s a problem, there&#x27;s always a <i>dedicated</i> tool to solve it, marketed for a particular purpose. Like e.g. various safety razors for different sexes and body parts that are all basically the same, sans color and packaging. Or cleaning tools that are just cheap rolls of tape wound backwards. People learn to solve their problems by mindlessly throwing money at prepackaged solutions instead of realizing they could reuse something they already use to solve a different problem.",1438516859

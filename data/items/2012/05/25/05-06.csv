4022135,comment,4019861,4020107,3,0,rayval,,,"I agree the presentation is ineffective. On my read, anyway.<p>There is a logical sequence to the pitch but that is not reflected in the visual structure. The top horizontal menu keeps the ""Problem"" disjoint from the ""Solution"". The precursor to this pitch deck was the DressRush pitch (<a href=""http://investors.dressrush.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investors.dressrush.com/</a>), which does a better job at showing the logical sequence of a pitch, from Intro to Team to Problem to Solution.<p>But even DressRush is missing a key mechanism: a simple Next arrow that cycles you through all the content. After all, we are only talking about 10 screens or so. There should be no need for fancy navigational mechanisms that get in the way.<p>Some of the screens get truncated at the bottom but show you an arrow on the right side. The user is torn between scrolling down or scrolling right. (Violating the UX mantra: ""Don't make me think"").<p>It almost seems like the Piccsy pitch is trying to get the user to meander aimlessly through the content. And in that respect it is successful. I went through the path I thought they wanted me to follow, but then when I skipped back I found I had missed some important charts and data.<p>The visual appearance is over-designed and over-fontified (a made-up word) at the expense of readability. Perhaps because it is at the end of a long day for me, but at this hour I don't want to puzzle out coy infographic-style design when looking for basic numbers. The journey is not the reward.",1337925430

From what I've seen I would love to use coffee (I've actually used coffee in reverse, to tweak out a javascript function), but I'm wondering if I'd be lowering my productivity.<p>What I mean by that is, if I wrote coffeescript, but everyone else worked in javascript (or compiled coffee), then it'd be silly of me to continue doing so. Similarly I've watched a lot of node module development over the past year, and only once I've come across a module written in coffee.<p>I do of course realize NodeJS in itself is not ""very"" widespread yet, but are there any node users who can shed some light on the possible future of coffee in node?",1337925412
4022133,comment,4020187,4021935,1,0,ballooney,,,"I would add that an advantage of Matlab for number bashing is a much more native handling of linear algebra. Let's say you have two matrices A and B, in matlab I could write:<p><pre><code>  A*B*A'\n</code></pre>\nWhereas in python it would be (approximately):<p><pre><code>  dot(A, dot(B, inverse(A)))\n</code></pre>\nso matlab can evaluate everything in the right order (right to left) whereas for numpy I end up writing a little recursive function to dot a list of arguments together from right to left, which feels a bit cludgey and more of an impediment to getting your ideas down in code.

4022081,comment,4001727,4001727,1,0,benipk,,,"As someone who's been deaf since 18 months of age (Meningitis), I feel your pain David. I'm fairly lucky, as my hearing loss means I'm just within the bracket of being able to use a hearing aid, which are the most powerful ones on the market, but I suspect within a decade or two I'm probably going to need a cochlear implant myself.<p>The difficulty for me is being between two worlds, I can speak well enough that most people don't realise I'm deaf, which creates its own problems as they won't compensate for speaking to a deaf person, even if they know how. Since I was always able to hear with hearing aids, I never learnt to sign as I and others didn't feel it was needed. Lip-reading and a degree of hearing as enough to get by. So when you can't hear well enough to be completely at ease among normal people, but you can't sign either, so you're barred from the totally deaf community too.<p>I'm in my  30s now, and I've been through the denial, self-loathing and social ostracisation through my teens at school and 20s in University that made life pretty hard. As you've pointed out in your article, people don't intentionally exclude you if you're deaf - but if you miss every other word in a conversation it gets embarrassing asking people to repeat themselves every few seconds! A work environment isn't too bad in my experience, social environments are a whole 'nother thing though. Pubs? Clubs? Even a quiet cafe usually has too high a level of background noise to understand someone...<p>That said though, don't be disheartened when it comes to relationships. I've had 3 'proper' relationships over the years, the first wasn't until I was older than you are now. All of them have been positive, and my girlfriend in each case has never had an issue with my hearing. If someone wants to get to know you, they will make small sacrifices, small changes in their behaviour if that's what it takes to get to know you. If they're not prepared to make any changes, well, chances are they're not worth knowing in the first place! Simple things like ""face me when you're speaking"", ""Don't talk with your mouth covered"", ""Make sure you have my attention before you start speaking"" are not that hard to do, and remember: It says a lot about the person in question if they can't even be bothered with such simple things.<p>Sadly, you may find that your deafness will shape what kind of job you ultimately feel most comfortable in. It'd be nice to think that in this day and age, any job should be open to someone with a disability, but that's certainly not going to be the case. Personally, I'm self-employed with my own company after dabbling in the Biotech industry after leaving Uni.<p>The key thing is, there are awesome people out there who will be good friends. It's just harder to find them for you than it is for normal people. I'm lucky in that the friends I made in High School are still, 15 years later, the best friends I have ever made.

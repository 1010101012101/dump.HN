The internal pain and suffering becomes part of you and you're forever changed into someone else. We as human beings are defined by our pasts, as they shape us into who we are today. Sometimes, it's too much to bare. Sometimes it's manageable. And ever once in a while, someone goes over the edge.

2083027,comment,2081321,2082232,0,0,sp4rki,,,"Really? Who are you to tell someone he just needs 'counseling, attention and love'? I can tell you from personal experience counseling, attention, and love can very much be not only unproductive, but can easily make things worse. It's tiring to hear people say that the aftermath of event's that mark you like this, such as being raped, witnessing murder, physical abuse and torture, killing (be it a person from an enemy army or protecting your family), are solved by:<p>- Going into counseling, as sometimes it's just not enough.\n- Getting attention, as it's a distraction that can sometimes make falling back into the 'darkness' more painful.\n- Love, as more times than not it's easy to not be able to let go of the pain and transmit it to your loved ones and hurt them because of it.<p>It's easy to judge other people when you're living a sheltered life and you have some delusions of grandeur about how people with X and Y attributes should behave in a certain way that has been lodged in the back of your mind because of your upbringing or religion. The fact that you can so easily say that smart and brilliant people don't take their lives is a clear indicator that you really don't have a grasp on what being smart or brilliant is, but more important than that, it clearly shows that you have not had to go through anything as traumatizing as what this man went through.<p>In reality when you've gone through traumatizing events such as this, there is only one thing that will define if you're suicidal or not, and it's if you are strong enough to live with yourself, your 'darkness', and knowing someone else is either alive and unpunished, or suffered an undeserved and painful death.<p>I've seen stuff you could get out of a Saw movie, and sadly had to live a violent episode defending my home and loved ones (despite a middle-upper class upbringing, I did end up living on the crappiest and violent part of town on a small room with 2 other persons sharing a bed). Because of what I've lived I can tell you three things: smart/brilliant people take their lives because they can't deal with the feelings, not because they're actually dumb by some morality troll's standards; things like this mark you for life, and no amount of counseling can turn you back into someone you once where, though that doesn't mean that you can't live with the events or your decisions (In my case it gave me the most untrusting and uncaring character, which is something that affects every relationship I've had, romantic or otherwise); and people that act judgmental regarding things like this are doing so because they have this grand ego which gets fed by making others feel like they're beneath them. No one who has ever had to go through something as traumatizing as this would have the the heart (or the balls) to say the bullshit you've said.<p>Be more respectful and stop letting your nonsense morals talk crap of other people that deserve at least the silence of the witch-hunt people holding the pitchforks.",1294494119

It's a small, self-selected group of users that in no way represents the Internet at large.<p>I'm not the only one who thinks so: <a href=""http://franticindustries.com/blog/2006/12/18/why-alexa-sucks/"">http://franticindustries.com/blog/2006/12/18/why-alexa-sucks/</a>",1174424312
5230,comment,5194,5194,0,0,python_kiss,,,"""Good to Great"" and ""Built to Last"" are both amazing books. But I do not recommend it to startup founders unless you're planning for an IPO. Both books were written to entice established corporations (GE, Sony, P&G, etc) not startups. CEO's of big companies will certainly find Jim Collins of much help, but us startup founders won't. Though, it is a definite read if you've some spare time on your hand :)",1174424181

5226,comment,5194,5217,0,0,python_kiss,,,"It's interesting to hear this advice from multiple channels. I was just on phone with iJigg cofounder (zaidf on news.yc) and he emphasized this point as well. <p>I finished reading first three chapters of ""Founders At Work"", and this advice seems to be consistent with all three interviewees. I am sure there are exceptions to the rule; but generally speaking, it pays to have a good team.",1174423752
5225,comment,5184,5184,0,0,acgourley,,,"The title seems to imply the content of the post is incorrect because of the Alexa numbers, but the Alexa numbers are not really relied upon as a strong premise. (Actually, there isn't really a strong premise, he just sort of asserts his opinion)<p>Anyway, that doesn't mean he's totally wrong either. Although I admit there is still space in the ""long tail"" for more new web apps, it will be difficult to keep making web apps once every site has to battle existing players. Google/Yahoo/Microsoft/Cisco won't prop up the industry with constant acquisitions of unprofitable companies forever. ",1174423291

The first impression I got of GoPlan was that it had a nice design and looked pretty damn good. <p>If I was in the market for a web-collab app, I would now be considering GoPlan instead of immediately thinking of 37Signals.<p>That doesn't seem like a horrible them for them at all.",1174421315

You'll want to establish what courts might be used for dispute resolution.  You'll need to be explicit about any behaviors that would result in you terminating their service without refunding their money.<p>Your users agree to certain obligations as part of the contract; you should too.

The most important thing isn't the market you target, the product you develop or the financing, but the founding team.""<p>This morsel of advice sounds familiar, doesn't it?

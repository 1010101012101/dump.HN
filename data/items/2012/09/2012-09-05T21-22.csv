Definitely the best handsets running Windows Phone, and if I weren't so enchanted by Apple's walled garden, I'd probably consider it over the next iPhone.<p>The Lumia 920 is the uniPhone in all the right ways. Reminds me very much of what Palm tried to do with webOS and the Pre  Microsoft and Nokia are just in a better position all around to pull it off.<p>Having said that, very much bummed by an announcement of what seems like a great product that doesn't include pricing and/or ship dates. As to why they were announced before the new iPhone, it seems obvious to me that if they aren't ready to ship, you'd at least want some mindshare to stem the tide of the looming iPhone launch. I bet at least some people will wait to upgrade.",1346882395

It's possible. Obviously as someone who takes quite a lot of the leftist view I don't like that explanation.<p>>The left seriously argue against both the existence of game theory<p>Interestingly criminals tend not to take a rational approach to evaluating the risk of punishment (or else, their utility function is rather skewed). There's a wealth of evidence that longer prison sentences don't deter crime any more than short ones, and while the threat of prison has some deterrent effect, it's less efficient overall than e.g. community service (which has far better reoffending rates)<p>>and the existence of uncurable psychopaths?<p>While such people exist, a) they make up a tiny proportion of the current prison population b) prison, and ""punishment"" in general, is not really an appropriate way to deal with them. Some people genuinely do need to be kept out of society, but we can deal with those cases as a medical matter rather than crime and punishment.<p>>Is the left really aware of that many crime victims gets their lives destroyed?<p>You'll find a lot less sympathy for violent criminals than property crimes. Certainly the leftist position would be that, considering their overall life, a typical burglar is more in need of help from society than their typical victim, but I don't think that's so unreasonable. Certainly going by the obvious financial measure it's true.",1346882382

Particularly if it is a new car you can generally get down to somewhere around invoice pricing. Email a handful of dealers in your area saying ""I'm shopping around and I'd like this car at x price with x features, can you do it? Yes or no?"" and if they say yes, print it out and take it with you to the dealer. Carwoo seems to be very helpful with this process but at the time I was purchasing my car Carwoo didn't even have an option for 2012 vehicles.<p>After that it's just a matter of keeping your eyes open as they can sometimes try to change the price on you or some other cheap shot. The internet managers at dealers generally seem a bit easier to work with but beware of their managers that start pulling out all the tricks. I've even had a dealer finalize a price, hand me the papers to sign and they conveniently added a $2,500 fee that ""they add to all purchases""<p>When you go from working with internet companies all day to old-fashioned car dealers suddenly the convenience of straight forward ""honest prices, no surprises"", zappos customer service and a generally painless sales process is gone.<p>Maybe I'm spoiled from buying too many things too easily on Amazon all day with 1 click purchasing at fair prices but even if I am, why can't car sales be this way?

They can both be used appropriately, or used badly and in excess.<p>The address book in OSX is an example of bad skeumorphism -- it's a fake book with pages that don't actually turn, trying to shoehorn ""advanced"" computer technology into a visual representation that doesn't work. It's a bad metaphor, a bad analogy. It confuses more than it helps.<p>The ""Notes"" application on OSX is a fantastic use of skeumorphism. The legal-pad look shows us at a glance that it's for taking notes, which a plain white background wouldn't do. The analogy between individual note documents and pages is perfect. Anyone can use it instantly, without worrying where documents are saved or anything like that.<p>The fundamental question is, are design choices helping or hindering understandability and usability? Apps and the web have evolved conventions like share icons and tabs and underlined/colored links, etc. which people understand. Skeumorphism just adds vocabulary from the physical world to the toolbox.<p>And in the opposite direction of skeumorphism, I think the SVBTLE blog platform itself goes too far to the minimalist. I can't tell people's blogs apart, because they all look virtually identical -- that's bad design. And what the heck is the ""kudos nipple""? Why do you hover instead of clicking?

My comment regarding bewilderment at the sense of entitlement behind making demands of companies has more to do with personality differences than anything else. I realize that I am a consumer, and they are the producer of a consumer good. That is my relationship with Apple. That's it.<p>The ""entitlement"" is just my perspective of what I see as a group of individuals who align themselves with the OP's viewpoint in scolding Apple, taking shots at, and generally nitpicking it's wall-garden philosophy; A very vocal, relatively speaking extremely small minority of consumers who demand that the company change it's policies to fit their whims and philosophies.<p>I guess I would never be so presumptuous to think like that. To me, the company does what it wants, and when the public votes with their dollars, their business decisions are either validated or they are not.<p>And there is something that I just can't grasp about the hand-wringing and scolding about the app store. The iPhone is a great product, the app store is arguably one of the most successful new ventures of apple in the last decade, arguably the most successful app store for any mobile device. And by and large, the system works. So this barrage of criticism of edge cases is just...confusing to me, to say the least.<p>I appreciate that the writer is concerned about Apple and about consumers.

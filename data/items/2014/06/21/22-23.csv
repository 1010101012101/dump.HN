This obviously isn&#x27;t a perfect solution; there could be some rich person willing to spend big bucks on a quadcopter while having no clue what he or she is doing, or in the future there could be a $500 off-the-shelf quadcopter with 2 foot rotors (unlikely for quite a while, but possible).

And if so, whether that is for the better or for the worse in the grand scheme of things is yet to be seen; geologists say that we are &quot;due&quot; for another glacial period, based on previous glacial and interglacial periods. But human emission of CO2 could keep things from spiraling towards a cool down, which might delay the next glacial period for a long time. Or perhaps glacial periods are mostly caused by cosmological forces, which are out of our control; there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any clear answers.",1403391289

(Not commenting on the political valence of this, in observance of the HN politics rule.)<p>Last year, after requesting an ITIN for my wife (who is not a US citizen and thus requires an SSN-esque replacement to be able to file joint taxes), we received two letters from the IRS.  One had the ITIN.  The other denied our request for the ITIN on the basis that &quot;We have already issued her an ITIN.&quot;  Apparently, the IRS explains, that second letter should have immediately set my accountant and I to doing forensic debugging of their protocols, because it means that something &quot;seriously wrong&quot; happened to our returns.<p>What?  Glad you asked.  See, the IRS had lost my return.  &quot;What?&quot;  The paper was &quot;in the building somewhere&quot; -- we had gotten a receipt -- but they were unaware of what desk it was at.  (Their first hypothesis was &quot;You failed to file&quot;, and they threatened penalties for that, until being confronted with a Post Office return receipt.  Which is, by the by, why you should always get a receipt.)<p>My accountant took over yelling at them for a while to find the return, and they eventually did, and -- miracle of miracles -- they typed it into the computer.  <i>Twice.</i>  Thus generating two separate and equal returns going through non-idempotent processes, such as ITIN generation.<p>When those two returns met up in the reconciliation stage, they blocked each other from processing.  No one at the IRS noticed this, for approximately 7 months, until my third call to their CS line got someone to actually look at the file.  She hit &quot;delete&quot; on the duplicate.  (I really hope she was simplifying that for me, because it scares me if they can <i>actually</i> delete anything.)  Return processed almost immediately, refund check cut 48 hours later.<p>I almost feel sorry for them on being unprepared to unearth potential political malfeasance, because that is after all a distraction from the day to day administration of the Revenue Code, but processing returns is, as the saying goes, &quot;their only job.&quot;",1403390461

Let&#x27;s say a middle-ground compromise is chosen on immigration reform: Deport new illegals, offer stricter official ways to become an American. Naturalize people who have worked or studied in the US for a certain time period.<p>Even if the individuals all agree the collective made a bad decision, that is not to say that the group decision itself was bad: It may have very well been the perfect lesser of all evils. A system can converge to an optimal solution, while individual participants do not realize this.

7926237,comment,7922028,7925738,1,0,x0054,,,">  If each of these small states were completely autonomous, and had to legislate their entire body of law, the citizens would care more, and they would develop more representative and accountable voting systems and institutions, due to the extent of the government&#x27;s responsibilities.<p>I see several possible problems with this approach. I had similar thoughts in the years past, an I was wondering what your opinions were as to the following issues:<p>1. Inconsistent laws in a small geographical area. As a real world example, take a look at the car window tint law in the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago. In Illinois you can have up to 60% tint on your windows, while in Chicago, the local rule is that you can only have up to 30% tint. Don&#x27;t quote me on those figures, last I looked into it was 10 years ago. But the point is, you can live outside Chicago, have a perfectly legal 50% tint, and than, as soon as you drive into Chicago, your car is all of the sudden in violation of one of the local laws. And they do ticket you for it. In your proposed system you would have all kinds of inconsistent laws. This is a problem for automotive laws, food safety, building codes, etc. The only solution I see would be for all of the small governments to gather together and agree on some standard set of laws that they will all implement. But than you are more or less back to square one.<p>2. Large infrastructure projects. Large projects require a lot of capital and a lot of cooperation from people in a large geographical area. Things like highway construction, rails, bridges, aqueducts, pipelines, all of those would require cooperation of dozens, if not hundreds of individual governments in your system. And you would always have holdouts, townships that would demand an extra something for their cooperation.<p>3. Research projects. Currently the united states government sponsors significant amount of research. If we were to switch to the township system, than that research would not be sponsored any more. Alternatively, maybe a bunch of townships could unite in a consortium to pay for research. But then you run into problems with division of profits from that research. Say 6 out of 10 townships paid for the research which resulted in development of a cancer cure. Would they then be able to deny the benefits of that cure to the other 4 townships?<p>There are a bunch of examples that I can think of in addition to this. In the past after thinking about this idea, the Jefferson Township model of government, I decided that I could not think of a way to make it work. However, a State system might work. A state system would largely eliminate the Federal Government and programs like the Social Security, ACA, Medicare, and all of the other social programs. It would also eliminate the Federal Income tax. The Federal Government would be responsible for national defense (military), borders, interstate transportation, and the interstate laws and treaties. The interstate laws would be a set of laws that 3/4 of the states would agree on. Things like food labeling, minimal vehicle safety requirements, etc.<p>To pay for the Federal Government each state would pay a yearly membership fee based on the number of people in that state and the GDP of the state, or some other kind of matrix. It would be up to each state to organize their own Social Security, health program, and other social programs. Each state would also be free to decide how to govern it self, would have the power to collect income tax, etc. The main key to the system would be free travel. This means that no person could be prevented from leaving one state or moving to another. This would allow each state to experiment with all kinds of government models, and would allow people to vote with their feet.<p>Any way, my idea is as unlikely to ever come true as the Jefersonian system.",1403389667

One cannot simply point to &quot;changes&quot; in an organism, micro- or not, call that evolution, and then say it must be true. And just because there are similarities evident in different types of organisms, it does not necessarily follow that they are of common descent. If they were designed by the same designer, would you not expect to find some features in common? But this does not mean there is a natural mechanism to turn molecules into a genetic code that can in turn be read by a a decoding system (after all, what good is a code without the decoder?) which can then construct an organism. Even the simplest of organisms must have intricate, complex machinery inside for it to exist. I know of no method whereby this machinery can come into existence without intelligent direction. And even this simplest of organisms has no means of improving upon itself to create a &quot;higher&quot; organism. You say that the accumulation of minor changes (via mutations, perhaps?) is the mechanism whereby evolution works. I posit to you that such changes are examples of broken genetics whereby information is LOST, not gained, and are incapable of building a higher organism. See works such as Michael Behe&#x27;s &quot;The Edge of Evolution&quot; for a more in-depth look at such changes.<p>To use your turn of phrase: Evolution is not based on evidence. It is not falsifiable. It is not a scientific theory. It is a quasi-theory-of-the-gaps based on the assumption that there is no higher intelligence that created anything, and all we see HAS to be the result of natural processes. It ignores the mountains of indirect evidence pointing to design.<p>My point is: we see cars, computers, planes, etc. around us all the time, but we would never dream of suggesting that they are the result of natural processes. They are the obvious result of SPECIFIED COMPLEXITY, which requires some intelligence for its existence.

For example, claiming that the Big Bang excludes the existence of God. You can&#x27;t scientifically disprove his existence. I&#x27;m not sure you can scientifically prove his existence either, but that&#x27;s were faith comes in.",1403388330

I just think that considering what maximizes the mean/median of world prosperity is as important, if not somewhat more important, than considering how wide the standard deviation of wealth distribution is.

They didn&#x27;t actually  expect them using this opportunity to teach kids creationism but it was fairly inevitable under the circumstances.",1403388086

Economists panic about things getting cheaper because they are compromised by the current banking system, which is based on fractionally reserved debt and requires inflation to stave off a general run on fictional assets.<p>Consider: computers have been getting cheaper for a generation and its been one of the greatest economic boons in history.<p>I&#x27;m aware of the standard economic criticisms of deflation, I just don&#x27;t agree with them.  The massive deflation shock of the Great Depression was due to the preceding leverage boom, and should not be used for a general analysis of deflation without considering that boom.<p>Deflation is usually good.  Things we want cost less of our labor.  The benefits are widely distributed with no early receiver advantages as there is with inflation.  This is a good thing.",1427821134

And to be honest it seems more prevalent the younger you are.<p>If you like a brand, you should really be doing a quick c/b analysis prior to making any purchase. Why? Because it changes often.<p>A seller&#x27;s entire goal in life is to extract maximum profit, so they tinker endlessly, with formulas, package sizes, prices, etc, etc.<p>As a consumer, you should be looking at how this movement affects your personal cost benefit analysis. At some point, the price may become too high, the formula not ideal, etc. for you.<p>Simply disregarding that and saying &quot;no matter what, I buy Tide&quot; is a sure way to be taken to the cleaners.<p>This is a genius bit of technology for businesses that want to maximize profits, so I&#x27;m sure they will be all over it. P&G would love to sell you Tide without you even looking at other brands, or the size of the package, or the price. It&#x27;s a seller&#x27;s dream.<p>It&#x27;s horrible for a consumer though.

9297787,comment,9291404,9294893,0,0,geofft,,,"It is true that _NSAKEY was necessary for the technical implementation of cryptographic export controls. It is also true that one of the goals of cryptographic export controls was weakening the security of people who use exported software. (Although saying that the NSA had only one goal is pretty wrong: read up about DES&#x27;s S-boxes, which caused all sorts of cries of &quot;Backdoor!&quot; before Snowden was even born.) But calling _NSAKEY a &quot;backdoor&quot; is confusing for lots of reasons.<p>At the same time as _NSAKEY, there was another bizarre mechanism in the &#x27;90s called &quot;server-gated cryptography&quot;. US law was that exported cryptography could not be stronger than 40-bits, but there was an exception for financial organizations. The implementation was that certain CAs were trusted to verify whether their customer was in fact a financial organization (trusted in the sense that, if the browsers decided wrong, they were violating munitions control laws...) and could place a special extension in the certificate. If that certificate was present, export browsers would negotiate 128-bit cipher suites; otherwise they would only negotiate 40-bit cipher suites.<p>This mechanism, incidentally, blew up in our collective faces two weeks ago under the name &quot;FREAK&quot;, and there was a lot of talk about whether the NSA&#x27;s meddling was appropriate.<p>But where&#x27;s the backdoor? In this case, it is the <i>presence</i> of certain CA keys that allows strong crypto, and their <i>absence</i> weakens it. _NSAKEY has the same goal, but it&#x27;s just done in reverse. So calling the key a backdoor is not very meaningful, since in the SGC case, we&#x27;d have to call the absence of a key a backdoor.<p>This is a very different sort of thing from the Lotus escrow business in this article, where the software silently encrypts the data to a public key owned by the NSA. The Windows _NSAKEY is just a signing key, and in US versions of the software, _KEY is also allowed to sign all the same things. Nothing is ever encrypted to _NSAKEY.<p>Or, in other words, the presence of _NSAKEY in US versions of the software cannot possibly weaken anyone&#x27;s security.<p>If there is a backdoor here at all, it is the entire system of export controls for crypto. (Which everyone knew about because it was literally the law, so calling it a &quot;backdoor&quot; is sorta like calling Wikipedia&#x27;s edit-this-page button a &quot;security vulnerability&quot;.) All of this was very different from the Lotus backdoor described in the article.",1427820543

Then again, those who do gather evidence in politics, the softest science, rarely seem to find any that upsets their preconceived notions.  Anyway-)<p>...that this would happen with or without any overt government interference.  I&#x27;m sure that the soft pressure described by Mr. Chomsky plays a part, and that most government officials in democracies are happy that it exists.<p>But just look at smaller scales: say, at the umpteen &quot;camp A vs. camp B&quot; divisions that come up in one capacity or another on this site.  JavaScript is a horrible language that&#x27;s killing the web, or it&#x27;s a cool language with some flaws.  Go is a language firmly stuck in the 1980s with the goal of treating its programmers like disposable pawns[0], or it&#x27;s a fluid pragmatic language with an emphasis on maintainability.  Apple has a track record of producing shiny overpriced crap, or perhaps innovative products that usually beat the competitors&#x27;.  Google is an advertising company and absolutely everything it does has some direct connection to invading its users&#x27; privacy, or it&#x27;s a geeky paradise, tech culture&#x27;s truest representative among large corporations.  The NSA is a villainous organization through and through that&#x27;s killing everything important about American freedom (common opinion on this site, not as pervasive elsewhere) or it&#x27;s just doing its job and has little, if anything, to answer for.  Feminism... well, I think that word is enough.<p>These are just some of the biggest examples; there are <i>countless</i> others, and obviously you can get far more examples by broadening the scope from tech.  In each case, people tend to divide themselves based on their opinions into one of (usually) two opposing groups.  Each group is self-reinforced by memes spreading through its echo chamber, each is very confident it&#x27;s right, and importantly, eventually members of the two completely fail to understand each other, speaking with different terminology about different principles and both almost certainly far from objective neutrality.   Some of the camps have some <i>potential</i> equivalent to Chomsky&#x27;s cited explicit manipulation - c.f. the recent Fear of Apple post.  Most don&#x27;t.  People <i>self-manipulate</i>, and they&#x27;re rewarded with positive emotions generated from discussions with other people that share their views.<p>In politics, the camps form within political parties, geographical areas, and often entire countries.  It would be interesting and powerful to think of ways to reduce this; on the other hand, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to blame Western governments for what&#x27;s basically human nature.  My suspicion is that people look at the distortion of reality in democratic country X&#x27;s politics, compare it to censored country Y&#x27;s, find the proportion too large, and blame the government of X... but miss that a large portion of each side&#x27;s distortion is natural, and if you subtract that from each side, the proportion gets far smaller.  YMMV.<p>[0] opinions on Go aren&#x27;t usually that strong, I think, but I&#x27;ve heard exactly that claim from one firebrand on Twitter.",1427819707

The evaluation quality looks too optimistic - 98% / 100% quality means you made your code to work on your examples, but by using only a set of standartized tests you can&#x27;t check:<p>* how broad is the coverage - there are other edge cases in real world, it may be impossible to cover them all;<p>* that the splitter doesn&#x27;t make mistakes for real-world &quot;regular&quot; sentences (80-90% of sentences which are &quot;the same&quot;).<p>The example set looks very good, and it looks like a good way to compare other sentence splitters.

Or even 10K and 100K. It&#x27;s not that there isn&#x27;t any difference, it&#x27;s just that (ignoring extreme scenarios like having to pay medical bills in the US) the difference is mostly a luxury.<p>But below a certain threshold, it&#x27;s not a matter of luxury. It&#x27;s a matter of being able to afford the bare necessities.<p>I don&#x27;t make 100K/month. Right now I don&#x27;t even make 10K/month. To be honest, I&#x27;d probably be able to cope (as I have had to in the past) with as little as 1K/month or less. But I don&#x27;t mind if some investment banker or Fortune 500 CEO makes several orders of magnitude than me.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t just that someone who works two full-time jobs can barely afford the absolute minimum of necessities. The problem is that making money is a requirement to have access to these essentials. We don&#x27;t need more jobs, we need better social care. We don&#x27;t need to cut rich people&#x27;s wages, we need to eliminate poor people&#x27;s reliance on wages to keep them housed, fed, warm, healthy and content (or &quot;maintained&quot; if that sounds less socialist and more business-y).<p>Minimum wage is a red herring. Minimum wages are (and should be) dictated by economical concerns alone. It&#x27;s impossible to regulate them. You can dictate numbers, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem they&#x27;re meant to address.<p>Minimum wage jobs are not only useless because they can&#x27;t pay for a living. They&#x27;re also useless because they generally don&#x27;t offer any opportunity for personal advancement. If you mop floors at McDonald&#x27;s for a living, you&#x27;re likely not going to turn that into a career. If anything, it&#x27;s a stop-gap, but any effect it will have on your future occupations will likely have nothing to do with the actual tasks you performed (except maybe for a marketing sob-story if you make it big).<p>So separate the two concerns: give people what they need whether they have a job or not, and pay them whatever is economically sensible for any job they take.<p>Basic income and/or strong social services are a better solution than always trying to regulate businesses into supplying sufficient wages against market demands. If anything, the latter just encourages businesses to eliminate those minimum wage jobs entirely to reduce unnecessary costs.<p>You can&#x27;t compete with technological progress.

Assuming your starting point is not where all societies actually start from (destitute masses and lavish rulers) but instead have everyone start out equally educated and wealthy. You also have to discount corruption of the state, which is another critical aspect to the extravagance of elite wealth.<p>In a natural economy from a flat start you have people funding the interests of those with entrepreneurial spirit to form businesses. Assuming you have some form of social organization where those with the means and wit cannot just inflict violence upon others to get what they want, what generally happens is that capitalists build industry to create goods everyone else wants, while paying others to work for them where they get more money from the labor than the worker gets in pay.<p>Naturally, the total wealth of the workers must decline while the capitalists profits rise. But the capitalists want more money, and the only way to really put their money to work is either internal investment in their own company, or funding the ventures of others. Rather than the base state group funding of an individuals venture, you have one or few wealthy sponsors funding new ventures.<p>That does mean that over time you get fewer and fewer capitalist entrepreneurs that are successful, because less money goes into making someone elses business dreams come true and more goes into making the established businesses stronger.<p>But in that natural capitalist market you cannot do many of the things modern American companies do to exploit markets and produce unnatural profits. All of which require the violence of the state to perform, which is why government is always a double edged sword - you need something to protect the people from violence in the first place, but that just gives the violence to an influencable, corruptable group, and money - especially concentrated - talks.<p>But it is much harder to get a monopoly in laissez faire system where you cannot use regulations and ordinance to block competition the way almost every major business in the US does. Be it (ab)use of the patent system, abuse of zoning, abuse of permits, abuse of straight up law, companies constantly goad politicians into giving them an unfair advantage.<p>In that free market if someone starts abusing their growing monopoly for profit it opens up infinite room for competition because the only barrier to entry to a goods or service market is the ability to produce it. That requires a whole economy of productive goods markets - but you can always fill the gap from the start wherever monopolies arise, and while you can have monopolies form, they cannot act against the market for long without opening up room for competition - they have to skirt the border where their goods and services cost just enough to disincentivize competition which means just below new-entry market rates, and that is after all extrinsic influencers outside price - business practices and ethics, employee retention and satisfaction, and general reputation. Look no further than Wal-Mart for an actual example of a business that competes at below market prices but loses significant business to its own awful reputation.<p>So my point is that while capitalists in a laissez faire system can perpetually concentrate wealth, it really cannot happen nearly as fast as it has in the last fifty years because you need regulation to capture markets as completely as so much of American enterprise has.",1427818191

In this case there really just isn&#x27;t anything useful at a high level.<p>A better term might be it seems to violate the Law of Least Astonishment, but from the hacker perspective instead: I have a device that&#x27;s really just spoofing acting like a storage device. There&#x27;s a lot of side trips that normally can be taken to work around this, and each are the same sort of no-op, since it&#x27;s not for real. This sort of thing was common for the old &#x27;dumb&#x27; phones, but it seemed like it was because they were too dumb to behave properly; now here&#x27;s a smart phone being dumb. It&#x27;s a bit unexpected, at least for what seem like obvious things like &quot;add mp3&quot;. But there we are. The whole time there&#x27;s a feeling of &quot;gosh, surely there&#x27;s a better way&quot; and there just really isn&#x27;t: install iTunes and let it do whatever it wants, or you just don&#x27;t get to put that mp3 on your phone.<p>And wanting to avoid installing iTunes isn&#x27;t pointless. I mean, you may not see it, but there are certainly reasons not to. Heck, just failing to update iTunes was useful for a few years due to some odd DRM workarounds (mostly for a WinAmp addon that read iTunes music files). Besides, it&#x27;s fairly invasive - you may only use it rarely, but it installs a couple services and tries to jump in when the phone connects (all can be administered, but it&#x27;s a pain cleaning up that mess). While I&#x27;ve finally come to just tolerate it, I don&#x27;t appreciate it.<p>(Perhaps I should use counterintuitive? I would hope that would get the same idea across without somehow triggering offense. The problem I&#x27;m describing is of expectation and should be orthogonal to intelligence. There&#x27;s a lot of subjectivity to it, but no reason to take offense. Mindsets filter, so why would a hacker find the same things intuitive as your average user?)",1427818085

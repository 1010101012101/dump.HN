7047608,comment,7045832,7046478,2,0,logicallee,,,"I don&#x27;t know you personally, but am trying to understand your perspective and tone, which is extremely negative.  I read the whole comment I&#x27;m replying to, and also another blog post that you linked in another reply here, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t waste your time in a crappy startup.&quot;<p>In that post you write:<p>1.<p>> &quot;The most credible appeal of working at a startup is the opportunity to learn a lot, and one can, it’s not a guarantee&quot;<p>For me, it is quite clear what &quot;a lot&quot; might mean, but could you clear it up?  For me, a startup is in the business of executing on market opportunities to create equity value far in excess of the value that can be attained by the same resources allocated elsewhere.  For example: someone around here said that he couldn&#x27;t fathom how Twitter could possibly employ 1000 engineers!  That is way too many.  But Twitter has a market value of around $31B.  So in effect, the per-engineer market cap of Twitter is $31M.  That would be an example of utilizing resources in a way to execute on an opportunity.  How this is done would be what you &quot;learn&quot;, by seeing it done in practice.  Is this what you mean?  Or did you mean something else.<p>2.<p>When instead, you are among the first people to join a company, the opportunity is even more clear: if you see an opportunity by yourself, you can spend $50-$150/hour, whatever your personal salary equivalent, and personally code up a solution to it, owning 100% of the resulting value that you build.  In other words, you can build a $1M company for $300K in personal labor, and would do so as a 1-person startup.  If you lacked some skills, you would only contribute your part of that share, while someone contributed other parts.<p>This seems to me the essence of a startup.  However, it seems you don&#x27;t share this perspective in the least?  You say in one part of your comment &quot;not fucking de-risked at all.&quot;  But &#x27;de-risked&#x27; would mean that we no longer match the definition of a startup - as we are no longer utilizing resources to generate value far in excess of what the resources can generate elsewhere.  In effect, we are utilizing the resources (in a &quot;de-risked&quot; context) as a commodity.  So, it would be an example of NOT being a startup - like working at a cashier at a 2 year old business.  Just because it&#x27;s only 2 years old, doesn&#x27;t make it a startup.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter if the business is 2 years old, 20, or 200 - there is no real difference if you are working as a cashier, and if the 2 year old business closes you would just work somewhere else. Cashiers are examples of labor used as a commodity (I say this as someone who has been one in high school), rather than stake-holders in executing on a market opportunity to build value in excess of the commodity value of the labor.<p>3.<p>I would also like to ask about the following:<p>>I lost about $300k (opportunity cost) bootstrapping a startup over almost 3 years.<p>Do you simply mean, that these are the wages that you would have earned at the commodity value of your technical labor in the larger market?<p>Personally, the first time I read this sentence in your comment, I thought $300K was very low for 3 years - because I <i>misread</i> it.  I thought you were saying that, because the startup <i>chose</i> not to take VC funding, the startup <i>missed</i> its chance to execute on a market opportunity, by being undercapitalized to do so: in other words, that the market opportunity the startup lost was worth (only) $300K.  This would be the normal way to think about a startup&#x27;s &quot;opportunity cost&quot; in continuing to bootstrap.  If you were approaching it as a stakeholder in this process.<p>Please don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I am trying to understand your perspective.  As you reflect on my personal definition of a startup, would you agree that you do not really have an interest in using your labor in this way?  For example, it sounds like you haven&#x27;t tried to personally execute on market opportunities all by yourself without any cofounders: would you do so, if you happened to identify one?  Why or why not?<p>I am simply trying to understand your perspective, please don&#x27;t take this the wrong way.  It sounds like, in contrast with most readers here, you are more interested in using your labor at its commodity price-value, rather than to execute on an opportunity in excess of its commodity-value.  To use an analogy: if you were a construction contractor, you would prefer to dig foundations and help build houses for other people who are building them as new constructions for sale, while being paid at a fair market value for that construction work: but you would not build your own house to sell, for free, using the same labor.  That is just outside of your interests.  (This is the analogy, since clearly a real estate construction company wouldn&#x27;t build a house if the commodity price of the construction costs exceeded what it will sell for when it&#x27;s finished.)<p>Is this true?  If not, please don&#x27;t jump at me for misunderstanding you.  I am trying my best.  Perhaps it is possible though that you are just not interested in working with startups, irrespective of compensation.  i.e. even if you were a millionaire from a startup, you would have preferred to have done work under more certain terms for the same financial result, rather than by participating in the business the startup is in.  Is this true?<p>I don&#x27;t mean to offend you in any way.  I am just trying to understrand your perspective here.  If you could elaborate on the above points it would help me to understand your perspective.  I am open to your experiences.",1389563694

Too much of a downer?<p>During an economic depression, a growing fraction of the population is removed from the &quot;real&quot; economic system and market, they start to use Tide detergent, lotto tickets, drugs, cases of cola as their new economic system and currency.<p>In a similar way, as the fraction of the population still involved in the interchange of information decreases, despite all the article hand wringing, its pretty simple, they&#x27;ll just drop out.  Hard/impossible to say what the new system and currency will be.  People will just stop.  The future of the &quot;knowledge worker&quot; looks a lot like ... travel agent.<p>So, put it together, and in a post-knowledge worker economy, they&#x27;ll always be a small number of elite knowledge workers, and always be some jobs that are not financially viable to automate away (not many, of course), but overall society will just wander on over to something else and look at knowledge work / service work as something from the past... thats what grandpa used to do before all of them got downsized, or whatever.<p>The article is much ado about nothing, in the long run.  Currently there exists a service / knowledge economy, at least for a small segment of the population, and its going away, just like every other segment eventually mostly goes away.

Using MD5 alone exposes you to length extension attacks.<p>- You should consider putting a timestamp or nonce in the signature parameters to prevent replay attacks.<p>- The fact that you&#x27;re able to validate that MD5(password) is correct implies that you&#x27;re storing passwords insecurely.<p>- Consider switching your API endpoints to use HTTPS and sending the password unhashed. Hashing the password is not helping you here: since you&#x27;re using the hashed value for authentication, any attacker who has it might as well have the actual password.

As mentioned in the grandparent, this should work fine on a live process, but is harder on a not live one.<p>It&#x27;s possible the parent meant &quot;why can&#x27;t GDB make v[0] do an inspection directly on the structure&quot;.  The simple answer is: &quot;It can&#x27;t possibly know what the function call does&quot;.  So you&#x27;d have to teach it, specifically, that std::vector is special, or provide a mechanism to override the native calls with python scripting (IE be able to say &quot;here is a replacement for T &operator[int] on std::vector that is in python, and works without a live process&quot;).<p>GDB actually does real overload resolution (it has to, otherwise in some &#x27;simple&#x27; cases, it&#x27;d have to ask you 100 questions about what functions you are trying to call), making that strategy more complicated.<p>If your only mechanism for reproduction is a core dump, yes this is a pain in the ass.

An individual firm, for example, might use FUD to invite unfavorable opinions and speculation about a competitor&#x27;s product; to increase the general estimation of switching costs among current customers; or to maintain leverage over a current business partner who could potentially become a rival.<p>>The term originated to describe disinformation tactics in the computer hardware industry but has since been used more broadly.[3][dubious – discuss] FUD is a manifestation of the appeal to fear.<p>>About Robin Harris<p>>Robin Harris has been a computer buff for over 35 years and selling and marketing data storage for over 30 years in companies large and small.<p>>Robin Harris is a president of TechnoQWAN, a consulting and analyst firm in Sedona, Arizona. He also writes StorageMojo.com, a blog which accepts advertising from companies in the storage industry, and has a 30 year history with IT vendors.

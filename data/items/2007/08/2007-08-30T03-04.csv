These preposterously high speeds will certainly create opportunities for << internet >> applications, but I think that they are much less relevant for << web >> applications. The web is the internet's killer app and I suspect this will always be the case. There will be important transformations to be sure, but with more bandwidth we will just have more of the same.<p>I think that the web is a better interactive application than bandwidth-intensive video alternatives. It (even MySpace) inherently stimulates our higher brain functions, whereas video seems to universally produce a trance-like state. (Although, I suspect this may be a prime opportunity for impression based advertising.) However good a business that may be, I won't be a drug pusher.<p>More bandwidth doesn't make the internet a new medium; it just makes room for more of what we already have. If I had to guess what The New New Thing will be on the coming high bandwidth internet (and of course all of us here need to), I would say that it will be the old old things that people have been trying from the start. I think it will be nationwide video on demand; I think it will be bit torrent with a toll. I don't think it is an interesting problem for hackers or entrepreneurs. It is too messy. It is for suits in the media companies to clean up.<p>edit: I may have spoken too quickly. A moment after I posted this, I began to wonder how much bandwidth is necessary to eliminate the need for a local computer. That would make one hell of an internet application. I'm sure there are plenty more. But, I still trust that the web is here to stay.",1188446179

As a result, there are numerous great ideas being explored and new companies being created, it seems like every week. But what I find most interesting is how many people are unwilling to bootstrap their ideas, and would rather spend 110% of their time trying to raise money, giving up 90% of their ideas, rather than focusing their attention on building out the core ideas for their business! ...",1188445498

48094,comment,47915,47938,0,0,especkman,,,"As noted, these influences can be very disentangle from any real-world analysis.  <p>There was an interesting study a few years back that looked at the ""outcomes"" of a cohort of people who had all been admitted to an Ivy League school. Part of the study group attended and graduated from the Ivy League school they were admitted to.  The control group ended up matriculating elsewhere for whatever reason.<p>Past studies showed at a significant improvement in earning potential for Ivy League grads, but they didn't have a distinguished control group.  What this recent study found was that for most students of similar qualification (all judged to be Ivy League material by the admissions boards at Ivy Leage schools), attending an Ivy conferred no obvious advantage compared to attending a non-Ivy.  <p>The only difference was for students who came from more challenging backgrounds, those whose families may have flirted with poverty and/or didn't have significant educational attainment.  In those cases, attending an Ivy conferred some advantage over going elsewhere.",1188443486

48092,comment,47769,47769,0,0,thisisnotmyname,,,"This is a really terrible description for this article.  The term ""mutant"" simply means that it is a strain with altered genetic material.  A mutation is not necessarily detrimental, and it doesn't mean that it will glow green, or sprout legs, and it certainly doesn't carry any radiation.  Mutants are extremely useful for a variety of reasons, mostly for doing genetic studies.  Obviously, the best way of producing mutants is to irradiate wild-type strains.  <p>(I'm working on a PhD in the biomedical sciences)",1188443166

You eyelids have pores that emit a thin layer of oil that covers the eyeball, and helps prevent evaporation. Those pores get blocked.<p>She said to use a heat pack/mask (as hot as you can handle for as long as you can handle) an then massage the eyelids (pressing down on the top, and up on the bottom) to try and get the wax plugs out (yuk). Then wash your eyes. ",1188442865

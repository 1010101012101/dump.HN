I like the concept: less students would be funneled into liberal arts majors that don't have a high return if the schools realized that they could get a percentage of every bill gates they spit out.<p>some cs and engineering programs are shut down because they are the most expensive to run. this would reverse that trend.<p>seems kind of like VC applied to schools. but then the schools would have to be completely free: we are giving away a percentage of our company, we share in returns with our investors, but we sure as hell aren't paying them.",1336330778

3935932,comment,3935436,3935436,8,0,ecmendenhall,,,"The discussion of formulas for pricing risk and forecasting methods is a great (if unintended) example of the problem with student loans: any government subsidy will distort price signals in unintended ways. Even if government tries to price in risk (which is a good idea), the signals will only be as good as the regression analysis, will still be subject to political pressure, and will still concentrate rather than distribute risk. A poor forecast of the future demand for philosophers, or the decision to train more teachers for the public good will still result in human capital misallocation, even if it's not as bad as the current system.<p>Compare this to private loans, which use the price system and mechanisms like futures markets to evaluate and distribute risk. Instead of one formula to price risk, many formulas compete and the information they contain is aggregated and summarized by relative prices. Risk is distributed among many lenders instead of concentrated in the hands of government.<p>The worst possible equilibrium seems to be the system in place now: price signals are distorted by subsidies that cover most of the loan market, while private lenders serve those whose educations are so expensive that they aren't covered by already-generous government subsidies. Private lenders encourage these students to take out risky loans, while strict rules on default shift the risk to borrowers.<p>There are all kinds of alternatives to student loans, but they will not be competitive while federal subsidies continue to distort the student borrowing market. One of my favorite ideas is human capital contracts (here's a good paper: <a href=""http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa462.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa462.pdf</a>), which would work like equity instead of debt. Students could sell ""shares"" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for the start-up capital for an education. There are lots of potential pitfalls with this model, but I think it aligns the incentives of lender and borrower (or investor and future earner) in a much more positive way: investors would have strong incentives to help students succeed that do not exist under the current debt-based model. Unfortunately, big subsidies are a big barrier to entry: there's no reason to offer equity when one can easily obtain a subsidized loan.<p>I chose to attend a large state university on a generous scholarship and graduate without debt rather than attend one of the more prestigious schools where I was accepted and take on student loans. So far, I think it was the right choice. But if I had the necessary capital, I'd start a Y combinator for students: find students like me who would otherwise stay in-state and finance ""prestige degrees"" at an Ivy or other top university in exchange for a share of future income. The model would operate very much like a start-up incubator: providing mentorship and advice and placing students in well-paying jobs after graduation would have a direct effect on the profitability of the investment. It's just a matter of figuring out how to pick (or make) students who will succeed.",1336330498

3935927,comment,3935436,3935780,4,0,dlitwak,,,"Disagree, if a student wants to pursue computer science he/she should have a lower interest rate than a philosophy major. There is a much higher likelihood that the CS major will pay back the loan soon.<p>There is a bit of a naivete among college students, that having any degree from ""X prestigious university"" is enough for the big boys to respect them and give them a high paying job. As a consequence I know many graduates who end up working as waiters etc. Perhaps had this tradeoff been made more evident from the beginning, they would have made different choices.<p>The student isn't deprived of their opportunity to get involved in low-value fields, but that low value is more apparent, which should help their decision process.<p>And more high value graduates, with higher incomes and a better ability to donate back to the university would probably increase revenues in the long run.",1336330454

In the vast majority of cases in picking a name, it boils down more to founders and their personal issues with liking a name than the brandability and success of the name itself. There are some basic rules that matter but overall, being stuck on a name is more you than it is because the company couldn't succeed on a different name.<p>2. Given the situation with everything described above, I STRONGLY recommend you move on and find a different name regardless of any emotional attachment you may have with this one if you want to avoid issues later on. It's simply not worth it.<p>3. Asking to do a lawyer fight on this now doesn't make any sense.

It was profitable and I sold around 6 of them.<p>After that I ended up creating/selling turnkey sites - banner makers, web directories (this was actually really huge), ebay typo sites etc as well as Custom Content Sites, RSS Mini-Sites and RSS Search Engines (before the likes of Yahoo! Boss).<p>I participated in a lot of arbitrage including discovering a method how to purchase domains for $x and resell them for $xxx+ - a method which I released for free, and one which still works today.<p>As well as the launch of an advertising network - when I was 16 which included securing a fairly large advertising deal (well it seemed it at the time!) with a dating site before I even had decided the name for it or wrote a single line of code. I ended up offering some differences to ensure growth including the ability for ads to blend perfectly with gradient backgrounds. The advertising network had a successful outcome, although whilst it is longer in operation on the domain it was on (I actually still own the domain name) the users loved it and all I will say is that they were happy where they ended up.<p>Since then Ive been mainly buying/selling domains (using the method I released for free), playing with affiliate marketing and SEO.<p>---<p>Im not even the only one either, I could mention a <i>TON</i> of people including some mentioned by others here and the likes of:<p>Sam (citricsquid) who with only $40 to his name bought 2 domains for $10 each and turned them into million-dollar websites.

Higher-ups who still believed that they could offer a platform that would be more valuable than the internet at large. Hailstorm always felt like an AOL for web services.
2. Lower down in the MS hierarchy various areas were under pressure. They had technologies built on COM and Win32 that had been thrown together quickly as a response to the growth of the web. eg. IIS and COM+. Both had problems in terms of scalability (and security as exploited later) and there is was no way to improve performance without jumping down to C++. Obviously there were a lot of other issues with these tools and a ""rewrite"" was needed.<p>Microsoft were really playing catch-up here and ""copying"" various things from the JVM ecosystem such as garbage collection was required. It is worth reviewing Brian Harry's note re: reference counting. A large number of developers were concerned with the implications of this change but it was for the better (for more people - there is still no perfect solution here). C# appears to the uninformed to be a mere copy of the Java language but Microsoft included features to attract some C++ developers, help the transition, and improve usability over Java. SOAP is an abomination, but it is still better than DCOM which came before.<p>I think Rotor was one of the most valuable things that Microsoft produced in the early years of .NET.

One of our users won a large jackpot, our code started a transaction, contacted the 3rd party to have them release the funds, recorded the win in the transaction journal, updated the customers balance etc. Then the stored procedure which inserted a row into the outgoing email queue had a small error. This caused all of the database work on our end to rollback.<p>Updating a customer's winnings and recording a win are <i>definitely</i> things that should be together in a transaction - if one happened and not the other, that's a failure.<p>This is not the fault of using a transaction, this is the fault of not working with what is essentially a <i>distributed</i> transaction.

Jenkins</i> was about a school district that became majority-black as a result of white flight.<p>Kennedy's concurrence was illuminating: it seems to allege that the plaintiff and defendant in this case (the students and the KCMO school district) were <i>colluding</i>: an accident of venue was the only reason KCMO's school district was named defendant, and the actual, unnammed, shadow defendant was the state of Missouri, which was being coerced into funding an otherwise wildly unfundable mandate to create extravagant inner city schools by judicial fiat.<p>Thomas, Kennedy, and Rehnquist all put heavy attention on the circumstances of this case, that the federal judiciary (a) probably can't impose state taxes by fiat as a backdoor to legislation, and (b) clearly can't do so under the auspices that demographic ""segregation"" was equivalent to legal segregation.

- A HN post (or 2) isn't a launch, how could you expect people to flock to your app if they don't know it exists. Promote it properly;
- Launch =/= your first day, first days usually suck.<p>Keep going anyway, the idea is not so bad, although i think there are some other services out there that do pretty much what your app does (but again, that can be said for pretty much every startup :P)",1336327397

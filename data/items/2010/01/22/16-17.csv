1070006,comment,1069906,1069906,0,0,wallflower,,,"Public transportation is a choice for some. Whether economic-driven or lifestyle. My point is its optional - you can't force people to take public transit.<p>Public transportation is necessary because not everyone can afford a private car or wants to drive a car (not everyone can bike - and biking in inclement weather is not a good experience).<p>Public transportation works poorly outside of urban centers because of grid density problems (in the suburbs, you can't cut through someone's yard to get to a bus stop - whereas in the city, regular blocks make it more direct to get to bus stops).<p>However, public transportation has to support the suburbs because a lot of lower-paid workers rely on it to get to their jobs in the suburbs. On many suburban bus routes, you will probably find it a maddening experience - as it is designed to go in loop-around fashion through office parks.<p>In other forums, its been argued that private auto industry gets a huge indirect subsidy from the government by the government supporting almost the majority of infrastructure road costs, wars to keep oil producers in check. The private auto industry has huge lobbying powers (see how much highway construction dollars came out of the last stimulus bill). It's also been argued that the true purpose of public transit is to give jobs to people.",1264179505

You might even do something fancy like providing people access to a VPS which will run the server without allowing validators to <i>scp</i> everything back to their own machines.  Of course this is impossible to do perfectly; once you allow people to view the data in a text editor or hex dump, it is all over in a strict sense (scripts + screen-scraping), but it is still a step up from just handing over the files, and keeps honest people honest.<p>You might also provide some anonymization/randomization service for datasets (for instance, by applying an unknown linear transform to absolute numbers in the case that the results don't change, similar to what was done here: <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-cluster-data.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-cluster-da...</a> .<p>I think there are 2 reasons why researchers can be reluctant to share:<p>1) They are afraid of getting scooped by somebody else leveraging all the effort they put into developing the tools and curating the data and leapfrogging them.<p>2) Their results are suspect.<p>Such an escrow house would ameliorate the concern behind 1) and help suss out 2)  :)<p>Anyone else have thoughts on this?",1264179393

Conversely, one of the most important elements of learning to think like a Lisp programmer is to cultivate a dissatisfaction with repetitive code.  When there are patterns in source code, the response should not be to enshrine them in a list of ""best practices,"" or to find an IDE that can generate them.

However, I think when they start building their science on top of computers, I start getting a say again. Here's what concerns me about this increasing use of computers:<p>It seems like the vast bulk of these simulations are iterative, and therefore subject to mathematical chaos. How many of these researchers have any clue what door they are walking through? How many of them know what a strange attractor is? I'm sure the answer is non-zero; I'm equally sure the answer is nowhere near 100%.<p>Small errors cascade even if you consider a non-chaotic classical model. (That is, not that there is such a thing as an iterative model that is not potentially subject to chaos, but rather than even if you don't understand chaos you can see that small errors can cascade. Chaos just makes it worse, and weirder.) A simulation will have bugs like any other large problem. A non-programmer approaches bugs by banging on the program until it seems to generate expected results. (About 50-80% of programmers do that too.) Therefore, many of these simulations are simply reflections of the simulator's expected result, due to the effect of the researcher's selection mechanism running on the results of the simulations they run. How do we verify that this is not the primary factor in the result of the simulation? <i>This need not be conscious</i>. It need not be ideological, either; I can easily envision a simulation that ""should"" return a boring or trivial result being monkeyed with until it produces something ""interesting"", because the simulators think the boring result should not obtain.<p>A lot of algorithms you can use in these simulations are fundamentally unstable when used iteratively; some exacerbated by floating point errors, some mathematically unstable even with perfect real numbers. How many of these simulations use something unstable without even realizing it, given that it could take a professional mathematician to work out whether that's the case? Even algorithms thought to be stable and reliable can fall apart under pathological situations, and one of the odd things about mathematics is just how often you end up hitting those pathological situations when programming; far more often than it seems like should be the case.<p>In information theory terms, a simulation can not contain more information that the sum total of the input data and the content of the simulation algorithm. How many simulators understand the full implications of that statement? <i>I</i> sure don't understand the <i>full</i> implications of that, but what I do understand makes me pause a bit. Very simple simulations with rules that can be verified and initial data that is very solid I can deal with; for instance, I like the cell-automata based social theories that show the spread of information or political views or something, especially when it is clear the researchers understand that it's only an approximation. But as the initial data starts getting sketchy or the simulation grows enormous, I start getting nervous about the actual information content of the output. Just because the output <i>appears</i> to be information doesn't prove that it is. It is vitally necessary to be able to check the simulation against <i>real data</i>. For instance, physical simulations of, say, cars crashing can be verified. How many simulations can actually be verified, though? Frequently the reason computers were reached for in the first place is the inability to do the real experiment. Any simulation that can't be verified should be <i>presumed</i> worthless by default. How often does that happen? (It's 20-f'ing-10 and ""the computer said it, it must be right"" still runs rampant through our culture....)<p>And of course there's the whole reproducibility issue, where the <i>absolute bare minimum</i> for science would be to publish the <i>full</i> simulation program, <i>all</i> data, the necessary invocation and compile instructions to bring the two together, and all necessary information to understand the input and the output. Clearly, this is not something that fits in a journal paper, but how often does this happen at all?<p>No, I am not referring to any specific discipline here and in particular I'm not actually referring to climate science. I'm nervous about the whole movement towards simulations in general.<p>Note that I'm not reflexively against the idea. Meet these bars and I'm happy; give me enough data for reproducibility and verify that your simulation is in fact simulating something real and corresponds to reality and I am happy. (Many physical simulations fit in here.) But as more disciplines jump in I am concerned that these bars are not well understood, and I'm seeing ever more press releases about simulations that can't possibly meet these bars.",1264176560

1069884,comment,1069703,1069773,0,0,elblanco,,,"This is the perpetual problem of public transit in the U.S. If you build something, say a metro system. It has to be sprawling, with large parking areas at the outlying stations. And then significant infrastructure upgrades to handle the traffic to/from the station parking decks.<p>See, <a href=""http://www.fakeisthenewreal.org/subway/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fakeisthenewreal.org/subway/</a><p>The D.C. metro system for example, is about as wide across geographically as the Seoul Subway (in other words, its service area is very similar). But its daily ridership is something like 1/10th the amount (800k vs 8million). On the long arms of the system, adding more stations won't necessarily increase the ridership because the population density of those areas is too low, a station in one of these outlying areas with parking decks might only see a couple thousand riders a day. At any rate, in most cases it's actually faster, cheaper and more convenient to drive all the way to your destination than to drive through rush hour to a station, fight for the limited parking then take the metro in.<p>""Just move further into the city then!"" Is a sentiment I've heard quite a bit. But D.C. is not able to handle much more growth in density. By law no building can be higher than the Washington Monument, and even if that law were to be relaxed, it's unlikely to spur lots of tall, high density residential apartment buildings because there is a major airport right next door. So outlying areas like Silver Spring, MD and Arlington, VA end up with lots of high density growth. But at exorbitant pricing. Apartments 10 miles apart, in a relatively low density area like Northern Virginia or Southern Maryland can be as much as 3x the rental price of each other. Housing can be even worse.<p>While the East Coast of the U.S. is generally low density, it's almost <i>all</i> owned by someone. Lots and lots and lots of suburbs. Nearly any additions to a mass transit system requires heavy handed uses of eminent domain laws, which are always unpopular.<p>All of this to encourage people to ride mass transit.<p>But from the rider's perspective the equation makes no sense:<p>- Parking is expensive at the outlying stations, and even worse closer in<p>- Fare is expensive, I'm always surprised at how cheap mass transit is in other countries<p>- Added up, a single trip on a U.S. mass transit system can cost 2-3x the cost in gas and wear and tear on your vehicle.<p>- Many systems are relatively unreliable, the New York system is pretty good, and tends to route around problems pretty well, but later systems like D.C.s suffer from daily breakdowns, and single tracks, so a breakdown in one part of the system literally brings the entire system to a screeching halt. Resulting in hour long delays getting home.<p>- A trip on mass transit usually takes longer than just driving anyways, and in more crowded less pleasant conditions<p>- American cities tend to not be terribly walkable once you do get dumped off of a mass transit system. With few exceptions, like New York City, or Most of D.C. and Boston, walking in a typical American city is walking with a death wish. Crossing highways and major arteries full of high-speed traffic, few sidewalks, few pedestrian rights-of-way and on and on.<p>- Buses are also generally unpleasant, usually populated by people with vast, on-display, personal problems like drug addiction, homelessness, mental health problems, etc. Mostly because people without these problems have cars and simply drive.<p>Expanding on this basic idea for local mass transit, rail also stands a similarly poor chance. Outside of the Middle and Northern East Coast, rail is generally poor, and transit times are incredibly long. New York to Chicago for example is basically a 1-day trip by rail (overnight). But only a 3 hour flight. And those are relatively close cities by American Standards. By European standards that's further than London to Munich!<p>New York to Miami, on the same Coast, is a 31 hour trip by rail! But <i>only</i> 20 hours by car and 3 hours by plane. Which would you take?<p>New York to LA, across the continent takes several <i>days</i>. That's like taking a rail trip from Barcelona to Minsk.<p>The solution to the problem is thus usually phrased as ""just throw down some more rail lines and start counting the jobs"". Even more realistic people consider that, in an idealized world that would cost billions. But really, with the eminent domain considerations, massive restructuring of cities, de-suburbanization, rerouting of existing lines to be more efficient, easy transit to and from the system, parking, etc. we are more likely talking trillions of dollars.<p>So instead we get more limited visions like<p>- 1 more line on the D.C. metro over the next 20 years<p>- and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/18/map-of-potential-high-spe_n_167804.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/18/map-of-potential-hi...</a><p>Which, while really fantastic, and a great start, won't affect the vast majority of the country.",1264176105

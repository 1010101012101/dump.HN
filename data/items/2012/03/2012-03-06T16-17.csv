3671762,comment,3669802,3671634,3,0,mdasen,,,"There isn't a difference in performance.  It's a price difference because you're guaranteeing Amazon that you will use the instance (and pay for it even if you aren't using it).<p>With light utilization, you could pay the up-front fee and then never turn on the instance.  Yes, Amazon gets your reservation fee, but gets no hourly usage money from you.  By choosing heavy utilization, you are saying ""Amazon, I'm going to guarantee you that I will pay you $X for this instance over the next (1|3) years.""  In response, Amazon says ""well, if you'll guarantee me that you aren't going to up and move to Linode or shut down for the next (1|3) years, I will give you a discount.""<p>Amazon needs to make sure that it has enough capacity that when a random person wants to launch an instance, there's a machine with the capacity to handle it.  That means that Amazon needs to keep a lot of unused capacity around.  If you're willing to say, ""I guarantee that I will pay for every hour over the next three years"" Amazon can give you a discount.<p>Think of it like a CD at a bank.  You're telling the bank, ""you don't have to worry about your reserves when it comes to this account since I'm committing to not withdrawing this money for a year.""  That has advantages to the bank because they don't have to include that account in their planning of how much excess money (capacity) they need to keep around for when people want to withdraw.<p>Amazon can plan their capacity differently (and more cheaply to them) when you will guarantee that you will keep using/paying for an instance.  As such, they're passing the savings on to you.  This is a great benefit to a company who has a web server or two and knows that they won't be eliminating their presence.  It's also a help to someone like Heroku.  While the elastic nature of EC2 allows Heroku to always meet demand for dynos, Heroku could probably plan that they would need at least X instances and then just pay for on-demand instances for spikes in usage.<p>Heroku is actually a wonderful case for how it helps Amazon.  Let's say that Heroku uses 5,000 instances.  That's decently sizable.  If Heroku left Amazon for whatever reason, Amazon could find itself with hundreds of boxes of excess capacity that they were planning would be used by Heroku.  By committing to ""heavy utilization"", Heroku is telling Amazon ""don't worry. We will be on EC2 for the next (1|3) years.  When you calculate how many instances might be created/destroyed, those 5,000 instances are safe for the next (1|3) years since we've committed to paying the hourly fee on all of them for that period of time.""",1331052416

The frequencies below the nyquist are undisturbed. Then you apply a lowpass filter to the signal to remove these harmonics after all, we said at the start that the signal was bandlimited you get the original back unmolested.<p>Because analog filters are kinda sucky (and because converters with high bit depth aren't very linear), modern ADCs and DACs are oversampling they internally resample the signal to a few MHz and apply those reconstruction filters digitally with stupidly high precision.

As long as you do it in a way that doesn't break any non-disclosure agreements why should you be punished for it and do you really want to work for someone who would look negatively on you for expressing what you have learned from a bad experience? Even more important - perhaps the employer doen't know how bad the culture is inside or worse they do know and rely on you not ever saying anything to continue recruiting others similar to you?<p>Then, during the interview you can find a way to bring a summary of the negative experience into the conversation without it looking like you want to trash or burn your former employer or manager. There are many opportunities for this, a common question one gets asked is to describe what you have learned from mistakes on the job. This is open and general and one could easily work programming specific or soft skill lessons learned into the discussion that do not paint your former employer in a positive light.

Computing was new, exciting, available, and there was nothing like it or better at the time. These machines and what they represented were the future. They were even trendy. They were a 4 day week even!!!<p>That is not the case now.<p>While I admire the great priced hardware and look forward to playing with a Pi applying them to various ""problems"", I cannot see this kids lark at all. I showed my kids these things, and they have no interest in them what so ever. They have PC's, laptops, tablets, smart phones, Xboxs, PS3's, etc, etc. What do these things do? Not a lot. What can they be made to do? Less than everything we all ready own. They are impressed with it's size and price, but that is all. All they see is a very small computer that can do these same things their current machines can do, just.<p>Education? Think about schools (UK schools in my case). Budgets are squeezed, curricula locked down and time tight. Not to mention the lack of low level computing skills in the staff. Well, high level isnt much better, one of my kids acts as a class assistant because the teacher is pretty much clueless. Who is going to champion this and when? How are kids going to be motivated to do this low level stuff when they have alternatives that are much more exciting and ""hip""?<p>Im sorry, I don't believe the Pi is going to solve the education aim at all. The idea is commendable, and I recognise the problem and support any attempt. But I honestly don't see kids getting excited and I don't see any structure that will either capture or motivate them.<p>Sure, they are selling. Rightly too. But who too? 8 year olds, or geek experimenters like me? I mean, I can see loads of geeky uses. Im loving it. But any kids? Any primary schools? I was in primary school when I first encountered a computer. Secondary school it too late.<p>I dont want to be down on it in any way, it is a brilliant bit of kit, incredible price too, loads of uses, I must have one, but cant see it starting an educational revolution like BBC Micro (and many others) did.<p>I mean, its just too darn complicated. The old ZX81, 4 chips. The circuit is so simple. The software was simple.<p>You know, its just so darn complicated now. There is too much of a gap.<p>Ooooooo. That was long, and a bit garbled.

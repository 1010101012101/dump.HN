1190785,comment,1190389,1190389,0,0,rubinelli,,,"The most helpful book I've read about procrastination (and I've read many) is <i>The Now Habit</i>. It explains why people procrastinate, what they think when they procrastinate, why even simple tasks stress them out, how they can reduce this stress, why they feel they don't have a life, and specific chapters on how to deal with procrastinators.
Just to cite one of its dozens of ideas, advice like ""just buckle down"" and ""tough it out"" is part of the problem, because it creates resistance. Your natural response is thinking ""that's true, I just have to finish it"", which is wrong for two reasons.
First, if you ""have to"" do something, then it means you don't want to, so you fight yourself. You become your most severe taskmaster, you deny yourself guilt-free play time, you resent ""having to"" do that task even more, and procrastinate even more.
Second, when you think about finishing a project, you make it look overwhelming. As others here said, the right approach is choosing a point, starting from it for a few minutes, and see where it takes you.",1268581733

1190782,comment,1189954,1190168,0,0,sokoloff,,,"The point curiously missing from the C&D article is that a car driving a full throttle will also be generating only a tiny amount of manifold vacuum. In most cars, more vacuum is necessary to provide the power-assist to the brakes, once any stored vacuum is used up. (The brakes will work, but losing power brakes for the average driver will be an upsetting event, especially with a stuck throttle.) They mention ""don't turn off the ignition because that will cause you to lose brake assist"", but fail to connect the no vacuum at wide open throttle to the same end result.<p>I'm sure the C&D test drivers were willing to mash the pedal and generate the best braking force the car was capable of. The average person, confronted with a stuck throttle, lost power brakes and the resulting ""hard"" brake pedal may very well not be able to summon the force required to generate full brake pressure. (It's an amazing amount of force compared to what you're used to using. If you're also the type to worry about flipping the car from putting the car in neutral, you're probably not going to bend the seatback applying enough brake pressure to get the job done.)

Since most people in fact have negative emotions about someone at some point in time, this sharing provides cathartic release, and since there is widespread feeling for this need, the meme spreads quickly.<p>It isn't exactly appealing to the best side of human nature, but the user psychology is interesting -- <i>particularly</i> the social angle.<p>Hatred/frustration isn't the only emotion out there, just like things that jiggle are not the only things that catch the imagination of twenty-somethings.  I wonder what could happen if you replicated the fundamentally social experience with something a little more positive.

Get to full throttle (over a second or two; don't take forever), and gradually release some of the brake pressure.<p>You'll find a sweet spot where the torque of the drivetrain is able to overcome the rear brake(s) and spin your right rear tire (or both of them if you have a tight limited slip diff). Your partial pressure on the front brakes, which are not driven, will hold the car stopped. You can further come off the brakes to let the car rollout of the burnout, or get out of the throttle and stay put.<p>Obviously, this is far harder on the car than driving to the corner store for some milk, but it's an effective way to clean off the tires at the dragstrip, a good way to get attention at the local teen hangout on Friday nights, and a great way to get a ticket for ""ostentatious display"".",1268581017

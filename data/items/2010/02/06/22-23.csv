The risk of spending six months to a year per book to construct books, and then discovering that the books can't make enough money to feed you. The scariest cost of producing a book has nothing to do with paper, or even with marketing or editing. It is <i>opportunity cost</i>: When you're writing a book, you're not doing anything else, and you may be very well throwing your time away.<p>Software startups reduce this kind of risk by taking money from angels or VCs. (a.k.a. ""publishers""). Or they try to gauge product/market fit as quickly as possible by doing things like shipping early, charging money, listening to customers, A/B testing, etc. However, this doesn't work well for books. Books have a smaller market than software, are <i>harder</i> to prototype, are much harder for customers to try out (it takes a lot of effort to thoroughly evaluate a novel), are much less valuable if they fail [1], and have a much more mature, undifferentiated, and well-saturated market: Your software has to compete against about fifty years' worth of earlier software products, most of which suck, and 95% of which won't even run on the machines your customers own. Your book has to compete against <i>William Shakespeare</i>. Literally.<p>How does the insurance work? A publisher reads your first book (or the first three chapters and an outline, which I'm told is a fairly standard way to submit a book proposal) and then offers immediate, free feedback: Either they accept it, which means pledging to stake a bunch of money and reputation to bring it to market, or they reject it. If your first book doesn't get accepted, it's a very valuable sign: You need to keep your day job, and you need to either become a better writer, try writing something different, try a different hobby, or learn to live without actually selling any of your work.<p>---<p>[1] Everyone on HN knows that having worked at a failed startup is no big deal. It teaches you a lot. You get a lot of resume-enhancing experience. And your failed software experiment may have valuable pieces that can be extracted. But bad novels are literally a dime a dozen, and an unpublished novelist with three failed novels is not worth any more on the job market than one with no failed novels.",1265495216

If the class relies heavily on images that cannot be easily drawn or represented and needs little textual content to achieve ideas PowerPoint presentations can really work well.<p>When you have subjects like mathematics and physics purely chalkboard whiteboard lectures is the only thing that works, even classes that are based heavily on either really need a chalkboard.<p>A mix can work well when the lecturer needs to represent a large amount of diagrams and concepts but still needs to explain how to work out complicated concepts, like example problems.

1106774,comment,1106635,1106738,0,0,dantheman,,,"The best lectures I've seen have powerpoint & chalkboard, sometimes with an overhead projector.  Each have their purpose.<p>1. For displaying text, graphics, animations, etc a powerpoint presentation is great.<p>2. The chalk board is great for pulling out important equations that will be used throughout the lecture (not lost on slide changes) and to interactively work through a problem.  You can draw something out and then ask students what to do next and then execute.<p>3. Overhead slides are great to manipulations on complex forms.  For instance showing how a parser works on a piece of text you can use a pen to mark up the text.  Or to show how different actions can effect a system.  For instance if we increase the interest rate, the line moves like this etc.  This allows you to answer questions in real-time in a visual way.",1265494512

When you're delivering a Powerpoint presentation and a great side conversation arises, you are pressured to return to the content of your slides before you divert too far. If you don't, then you've lost your visual medium for interacting with your audience. Granted, sometimes it's better to refocus, but it's arrogant to believe you can always anticipate the best direction a conversation can take ahead of time. Anecdotally, my favorite classroom memories of school involve the teacher abandoning plans for the day because students were passionately interested in a side conversation. I'll note that none of those teachers used Powerpoint slides.<p>Next, there's form. Most subjects are easily broken down by bulleted lists, but that doesn't mean that it's always the most effective way to transmit information to others. Some Powerpointers are talented enough to genereate lots of high-quality picture-based slides, but they're few and far between. I've met some of these talented few, and they're always clearer on a markerboard, because they are able to dynamically change their diagrams as I ask questions and comment.<p>I realize Powerpoint works better for some scenarios, but if given the choice, I'll choose the guy with the marker in his hand every day of the week",1265493655

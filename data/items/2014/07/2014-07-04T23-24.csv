My company rewards developers well for finishing fixed-bid (i.e. almost all) projects early, since it directly results in more revenue for the company - thus, it&#x27;s in my direct best interest to get any work done (styling or otherwise) as quickly as possible. Plus, I like anything that makes me more efficient / makes things easier for me.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure how you could possibly know whether or not CSS is good enough without knowing what else may be possible.<p>You&#x27;ve made an error in your reasoning.  It would not be possible for me to know that CSS is the best, but it&#x27;s certainly possible to know that CSS is good enough.  There&#x27;s a certain, explicit bar for &quot;good enough&quot; and that is being able to complete a project in a number of hours that is less than or equal to the amount we quoted our client. I&#x27;m able to meet or exceed that bar with regularity - thus, I can conclude that my toolchain as a whole is &quot;good enough&quot;.<p>> Supposedly, people in the past did not know that horses are slow.<p>My mind is definitely open to a better alternative - however, I feel entitled to a healthy degree of skepticism, given that I&#x27;m already doing better than &quot;good enough&quot;.",1404518347

I&#x27;m already a huge fan of Sam Harris, but I hadn&#x27;t read this one yet.<p>That being said though - I disagree with the notion that meditation can lead to similar experiences. Meditation can certainly create very powerful and &quot;spiritual&quot; experiences, but only for people who are both extremely skilled meditators (which is not realistic to expect even 1% of the users of psychedelics to accomplish) and only while meditating (with psychedelics you can see/hear/taste/feel/experience the environment around you, not just the environment of your mind like with meditation).<p>Psychedelics should certainly be handled with extreme care (yet there&#x27;s the paradox that being overly anxious/nervous about the experience may cause a bad experience), no doubt about it.<p>One of the cardinal rules of psychedelic use is to never do it alone though, his near-death experience in Nepal was due to breaking that rule. Being together with someone else isn&#x27;t a guarantee of not having a bad trip/experience, but it&#x27;s a good way to prevent putting yourself in dangerous situations like he did.",1404518205

I consider Java&#x27;s downsides (verbosity -- pretty much on par with Go) minor annoyances at most. I find advanced features offered by other languages (like more elaborate type systems) not worth their cost in complexity and maintainability (and in that respect Clojure is different: it doesn&#x27;t add complexity, and it tackles really big problems rather than minor annoyances).",1404517291

This is an exciting time that has me hopeful for the future of political participation by broader masses, and has me thinking even I could be more engaged than my usual generally voting along party lines for lack of familiarity with candidates (who can be bothered to research them all, right?).<p>Like I imagine for other regulars here, HN has done wonders for connecting me to so much of what&#x27;s going on in the world, at least in the topics carried.  I&#x27;m wondering if some take on the model of crowd-sourced consensus of what&#x27;s true/interesting/important plus community discussion could cause a genuinely informed (and even engaged) citizenry in politics, just like HN does for tech.<p>A thorough understanding of politics (including a wide range issues, back stories, pro-and-con arguments, voting records, who&#x27;s funded by who, and so on) requires so much sifting and winnowing, and it seems like the views you have are so largely determined by which sources you draw from (for example, I as a Daily Show fan see things way differently from the Fox News watching members of my family).  This makes giving a shit hard, reduces it for many (myself included) to &quot;too much work, can&#x27;t be bothered&quot;.<p>In an age where well-funded PR campaigns can obscure, distort or outright bury the truth, I get excited to think of a source in which truth, thoughtful essays, and important stories bubble up to prominence in the very democratized[1] manner in which they do here on HN.  Doubly so as we enter a mid-term election cycle: to tune into what matters as crowd-chosen by a mindful community who dukes it out in the comment section seems like a much better way to keep informed and play a part.<p>Does anyone feel the same?

I would rather not have my language throw a temper-tantrum and break down because I gave it something a millimeter different than what it was expecting.  If the object is supposed to have &quot;thing&quot; and it has &quot;thing&quot; then shut your mouth and use it, language.  Where JS gets weird is that it tends to put &quot;thing&quot; there in some cases where you didn&#x27;t expect it, but honsetly after learning the few cases where it does that, I&#x27;ve never had a huge problem with it - I think, like everyone, I bumped into some mild surprises (ya the radix thing with parseInt and [] == false and soforth), but they were never more than just mild surprises in development.  I know it drives people insane - and some people will swear that there is no way to build large systems with it.  I suspect those people are the same ones who asked the teacher for extra homework for the whole class when they were kids.  That was just never me, and I would just respectfully disagree.  To me JS is just a ton of fun and there are too many people making too many awesome things with it to ignore.  Apparently TJ got tired of it - maybe I will one day, too.<p>Until then, I just wish people would recognize that the reason JS &quot;won&quot; the language wars of the mid-late aughts was specifically <i>because</i> of the &quot;get-out-of-the-way-and-let-coders-code&quot; dynamic built into it - IMHO the modern web could not have been built with anything else.

Solid advice but unfortunately there are always powerful interests at work that have a stake in shaping your views and opinions. The church, the government, corporations, etc. Each of these things has a stake in an ideology that creates the conditions for their well being at the expense of the well being of others and people are extremely bad at untangling all those influences and getting to the bottom of who they really are. I even suspect some people are really uncomfortable with not being influenced and told what to do since they think chaos is sure to ensue. Every time I tell people I'm an atheist they act like they are seeing me for the first time and their immediate next question is ""How do you make moral decisions without religion?"".

Most people want a degree so they can get a better job, but who would you rather hire as a developer: someone who spent 4 years getting decent grades and a CS degree, or someone who spent 4 years contributing to open source projects and teaching themselves to hack? Of course some employers would choose the former, but a smart one would at least strongly consider the latter.<p>What does this mean for families? Many will undoubtedly continue supporting the institutions, but others may question the merit of spending years saving for and paying off debt from college when there are alternatives available.

When I tell people what Top-Ranked college I went to, the immediate response 4 times out of 5 is something like, ""wow, you must be really smart!""<p>However, I think if the average ""intelligence"" (however you want to define that) is higher than the population at large, it's more that the lower ~30-50% of the intelligence spectrum is severely underrepresented, and the upper 1% is maybe twice as common as you'd expect.  There's still plenty of people with normal talents.<p>All of which is to say that the prestige of my undergraduate education far outweighs what it might actually be worth.

1226007,comment,1225755,1225943,0,0,greenlblue,,,"This has been happening for at least the past 10 years and there has been very little change. There is a lot of pressure and monetary incentive in keeping things the way they are. I'll give you an example. Many lower division math classes are offered by the math department because they are service classes with hefty per unit price tags and ridiculous book prices, i.e. other departments use those classes as a screening procedure and the math department gets a whole bunch of money to invite speakers and support incoming graduate students and the book store gets proceeds from old book resale.<p>So as long as there is at least one department out there that is not feeling the crunch the math department will not do anything differently and there is always at least one technical department that does well no matter how good or bad the economy is. So from the other department's perspective it is a good idea to offload as much of the screening of students to the math department as possible since who really wants to spend time with undergrads when there are multimillion dollar grant proposals to submit to bring in money. From the math department's perspective it is a good idea to offer as many variations of the same course adapted to different departments as possible and from the book store's perspective it is a good idea to keep reselling old books at high prices. You tell me which one is going to innovate and get the others to go along with them. Each will cling to their old ways for as long as possible because honestly there is no real competition. The only way to get a piece of paper with B.S. and your name on it is to go to a big name accredited university.<p>Long reply because I've been thinking about this problem for a long time now and I don't see any real way to force research oriented universities to innovate.

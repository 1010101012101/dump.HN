111905,comment,111798,111798,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"There are a bunch of options...<p>I've never tried it, but Arduino sounds like a good option for you:<p><i>Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.</i><p><a href=""http://www.arduino.cc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arduino.cc/</a><p>It's based on an Atmega micrcontroller, which is also popular among hobbyists.<p>TI has a dead simple (looks like a thumb drive, plugs in USB) and cheap ($20) microcontroller programmer with microcontroller called the eZ430:<p><a href=""http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/landing/ez430tool/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/landing/ez430tool/index.htm</a><p>And Microchip has a pretty cheap and simple programmer for most PICs called the PICkit2:<p><a href=""http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en023805"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_P...</a><p>As far as connecting these things to your computer, USB is probably easiest I've used the PIC18FXXX5 series which has built in USB support (just add a few cheap components and a connector!). Here's an excellent website:<p><a href=""http://pic18fusb.online.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pic18fusb.online.fr/</a><p>And of course since you're interested in making MIDI controllers, check out MidiBox:<p><a href=""http://www.midibox.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.midibox.org/</a><p>Finally, a couple good resources/forums I find helpful:<p><a href=""http://ladyada.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ladyada.net/</a><p><a href=""http://forum.sparkfun.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.sparkfun.com/</a><p>I wish I had more time to play with all this stuff...",1202457561

111901,comment,111100,111852,0,0,eusman,,,"yeah i confused that with ISO 10646 (has the 3 levels which specify unicode, not all levels support the same characters) and UCS2, which UCS2 is essentially UTF-16, so i meant if he used any characters bytecoded in UTF-16 essentially he'd have a problem, although utf-8 doesnt support certain octets.\nUTF-8/16 were not yet part of the standard before UCS version 2.0. Been a while I guess since i got updated",1202456429

111898,comment,110992,110992,0,0,ibsulon,,,"BA in communications from the University of Arizona - minor in CS.<p>They were restricting the students going into the major and I flubbed up the first semester. (I got a D in discrete math. None of the concepts were difficult for me, but they combined it as a proof class and I just couldn't get the hang of them.) Also, I knew I was pretty good with the computers, it was the interaction with people I was lacking.<p>I'm strongly considering going back for a Ph.D in cognitive science, but I'll likely have to shore up some of my undergraduate weaknesses first. (The years in industry have taught me that as much as I am frustrated with academia, it suits my personality much better.)",1202456182

It isn't associative, so you can't paste in a few variables, and then a few more later, and it raises an exception rather than simply putting a message such as ""Missing variable: X"" in the output HTML.<p>I fixed this by simply using string replace(), and suitably unique replace tokens.<p>(Then again, I program in Notepad, preferring it for aesthetic reasons over Emacs, so go figure :-)",1202455074

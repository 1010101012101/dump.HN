Of course. An organization cannot really tolerate indivduality as a basis for their development. Everything must be coordinated -> politics -> bad decisions. After working in a large organization for 8 years I quit, but not before I sent a letter to the man on the top. I conluded that my problems were due to his (bad) descisions:<p>1. The leader of 130 IT workers was not educated in IT. None of the top leaders were into IT. Not even the lead architect! <p>2. The economists think of everything as a ""factory"". Therefore, IT is produced the same way. I call this the ""factory-view"". If you add more money, more developers you will get this done faster. If you need something, go buy it. It's always better to outsource.<p>There were other things as well, but these factors may probably be more widespread than I like to think of. Finally I left for a small firm. What a relief!!\n",1188209471

2056061,comment,2055525,2055775,0,0,dandelany,,,"> Copy-pasting code that you don't understand is pretty much the definition of laziness.<p>Disagree. Copy-pasting code that you don't understand is how most people learn how to code on the web. It's how I learned.<p>Most junior web developers do not understand everything that goes on in the web stack. They piece together the ability to run a functioning website by putting together bits of knowledge they pick up along the way. Some of this knowledge comes from reputable sources, like the jQuery documentation. Some of it comes from sources that may, albeit wrongly, recommend hotlinking, such as friends or Experts-Exchange.<p>When you're new to a subject, and there are that many unknowns, and you don't have a great mentor, it's hard to know exactly which parts are important to understand thoroughly, and which can be attributed to ""magic"" for the moment. Most people learn to program for the web because they need to get a project online, which means they are more focused on getting something working, rather than trying to grok every bit of the stack. I would bet that the vast majority of people that hotlink jQuery fall firmly into this category. It's not that they don't <i>want</i> to learn how not to hotlink, or are <i>too busy</i> or <i>too lazy</i> to learn, it's that they don't <i>know</i> that this is something they need to learn.<p>And that, sir, is definitively ignorance, not laziness. To be precise, it's ignorance of the fact that they <i>are</i> ignorant.<p>PS: Don't take disagreement personally, and don't call the person you're disagreeing with a ""Hallmark card"". It makes you look like a troll.",1293821136

Hm.<p>(For those dislike any and all criticism of, well, China, a possible solution would be to require that trade partners  implement and enforce similar levels of environmental regulations on manufacturing so that international trade is not just ""exporting pollution"". This is not simple though because China has a habit of fake-certifying things (for example much Chinese-grown ""organic"" food is organic in certification alone). So to work in reality and not theory, this would involve non-Chinese inspectors throughout the country with full access to inspect things, which would probably not be acceptable to Chinese State officials. In reality, things will continue as they have been going until the oceans can no longer support life, followed by massive extinctions of other animals such as humans and all other species whose ecochains have links relying on healthy ocean functioning to live.)",1293821126

The priority isn't on giving the community fast response times. That is not a goal in and of itself. It is on making Clojure better.<p>>Said resources are a lot more finite than they could be.<p>That is arguable. If hundreds of people came up and said they wanted to help there would be real challenges in managing their efforts. It is something we'd have to grow into, in any case. I still contend dropping all impediments to rapid, ill-curated contributions is a recipe for a complete mess. As it stands, the 30-day report here (<a href=""http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ</a>) says 14 issues created, 14 resolved. So, we are at least keeping up, and many times doing better than that. The best way for folks at large to get involved is to patch bugs. Defect issues with patches are our first priority. I don't see any reason why we won't soon approach the no-known-outstanding-bugs state I used to maintain by myself in the early days. Enhancements are low priority.<p>Helping out at a higher level is something you earn by participating. If someone I don't know says they've screened a patch from someone else I don't know, what am I supposed to do with that? There is an ever-growing circle of people I trust, and, to the extent they have time to work on Clojure, I am taking advantage of that.<p>>There are many capable folks in the community who would be willing to help.<p>Being willing to help and helping are two different things. Helping means doing what needs to be done, not just what one feels like doing. If I gave someone commit rights and they whipped through and applied all outstanding patches they wouldn't be helping me or Clojure, however good it might make the patch submitters feel.<p>I guess Clojure is just too conservatively managed for your taste. That's fine, but I think it is the appropriate route for a language, even if it means it is somewhat slower and more of a hassle to participate in than the latest github project du jour.",1293819251

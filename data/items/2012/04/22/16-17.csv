You can optionally enable live JS rendering now too.<p>""cmd+1/2/3"" - v3 has 5 panels now so it takes over even more keys, and although I coded it up, I'm kinda with you that I don't like that I'm expecting to get to a tab rather than a paenl - yet sometimes I like being able to control which panels. I'm considering other shortcuts - maybe optionally disable panel shortcuts (or opt-in?) - but equally open to feedback: <a href=""http://github.com/remy/jsbin/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/remy/jsbin/issues</a><p>""tabs"" + ""stupid auto-formatting"" - that's down to CodeMirror being used - and a long while ago I wrote a textarea version of the editor (which kicks in if you're viewing on Android, iPad, etc) - again, this might be a opt-in preference, but I use CM to ensure far reaching IE support because JSBin is primarily a teaching tool, and if a developer is stuck in IE7/8 they need to replicate the bug in that version of IE in jsbin (which is why I can't use ACE, et al).<p>""ubuntu bugs"" - I need to get an Ubuntu virtual machine and check this out - I've heard of a few people having problems in similar environments so I should really check it out.<p>Anyway, cheers for the feedback (albeit inadvertently :)",1335113949
3875349,comment,3873946,3874414,2,0,possibilistic,,,"This is literally the field I'm preparing to go into after I get my PhD in systems bio. The absolute best way to develop models for markers is to study metabolomics data for a huge sample size.<p>Take, for example, urine samples from a large number of at-risk persons and see how a specific type of cancer manifests within the group. Run the samples on GCxGC-MS and do high-order statistical comparisons or train an ML model to pick up on the markers. Given the proper treatment, these may correlate to breakdown products attributable to the development of cancerous cells.<p>You can model any metabolome too: blood, breath, sweat, biopsy... Urine is probably the least invasive. You should learn a thing or two about how elimination works: glucuronidation and other reactions that modify substrates to be polar enough.",1335113939

They don't allow work from home, or allow it only one day a week, etc, yet they also don't provide any sort of office environment that enables sitting. At the office I work at now, for example, there is no one who stands and it would take a re-working of the entire office to allow it, as there are dividers that can be seen over when standing, so it would be rather awkward, I think, to be standing as you would then be staring down at the person across from you. It would be interesting to hear a case where a company is held liable for forcing someone to sit all day, year after year, I think that could at least nudge a lot of organizations in the right direction towards allowing more remote work options where a person can better control / configure their work environment.",1335113635

The market is too complex and the early stages of a company are too hectic to isolate any one cause for success. If it were that easy we'd have discovered the secret to success by now.<p>In short: they had issues with their name; they changed their name; a lot of good things happened. Take that as you will.<p>--<p>EDIT: the article is actually titled: ""How a new name HELPED grow FeeFighers' business 25x"". So my comment is the only thing in error. From the article:<p>Problems with the name:<p><i>We kept talking to customers on the phone, or in email, and they would say things like How do you spell your name again? Whats your domain name? Or, I mentioned you to one of my friends.\nWere like, Well, why didnt they ever come back? We never actually heard from your friend. It turned out that they had forgotten our name, because it wasnt memorable enough.</i><p>After the name change:<p><i>Since weve changed the name [from TransFS to FeeFighters], weve raised a million and a half of additional capital. We have added five people to the team. Weve grown our customer base 25X. And were growing like 30 percent over month to month. So its been a really, really good year.</i>",1335112809

I absolutely believe in my first paragraph (I even emphasize my agreement), completely non-ironically.<p>My favorite way I've heard this stated is ""Napoleon didn't personally conquer northern Italy.""<p>Now, there is something diferent and special that the blog post we're talking about is referring to, and which basically holds ONLY with software.  As opposed to car company, health-care service provider, you name it, software is this thing where if you build the lines of code once, you can use them n times at a marginal cost approaching 0.<p>In any other business, if you go from having 10 customers to having 1000, you can't just put another couple hundred into the bank account to cover hosting bills while their monthly payments clear.<p>What this guy is talking about, in my opinion, is the small 2 or 3-person team that, without any money, but only time, Skype, IRC, cheap cloud hosting services (AWS stands out), and standard local and remote software-building tools, can build a complete application without convincing anyone to build it nor paying anyone to build it.<p>Does every team need a technical co-founder? (someone who can use git or ssh?)  I personally don't think so.  This guy would probably disagree.<p>(But, since the whole blog post is about semantics, I will say this.  In my experience, people - especially associated with Y-Combinator, who use the term ""technical cofonounder"" expect it to mean coder.  It's weird.  Here's something related.  The people who use this term use CTO to refer to someone who is really good at setting up the architecture of the stack, the database, the use cases, and committing actual code to create the application from scratch after selecting the language(s) and frameworks to use.  To me, none of this says ""CTO"", since, to me, CTO says ""director-level position overseeing technology"", and, to me, anyone with the title of CTO would never commit a single line of code and would only use SSH to check up on other people's work - never <i>anything</i> else.  But that's not the usage on y-combinator type startups, and this is what this blog post is talking about.)",1335112806

Write personal projects where you can tell people to go to hell ;) Let me elaborate for a second though: when I work on a personal project, if I want to implement a functionality and there's a library that does it, I write it myself anyway. If I need functionality and I don't really want to write it, I look for a library that does it.<p>Personal projects give you freedoms that professional ones can't. If your personal project isn't quite as stable because you rolled your own middleware in Node instead of using something that's already built, you can tell people to go to hell. These are projects that exist first to let you explore, interact, and build. Perhaps they exist second to provide utility to you. Only as a distant third do they exist to provide utility to others.<p>Now, that isn't to say that such a project can't or won't evolve into a professional one, or that you won't decide to make utility to others a higher goal. At that point, you'll have to see about revisiting some of your early decisions. But to me, what keeps things fun in that context is exactly that: creating something for me and no one else.

As a result, within one year it had 15% market sharean impressive achievement, and webmasters had to start doing something about browsers that were not Internet Explorer. Today the compatibility problems are largely confined within intranets, and the idea that you would need one particular browser to browse the web seems strange.<p>Lets compare that with where desktop Linux is today. What is the promise it helds? Which are its redeeming virtues that would make me and you recommend it to other people?<p>I have Linux installed on my auxiliary desktop system since 2004  either Ubuntu or Debian Sid. The main issue that prevented me from switching when I was more enthusiastic was this:<p>I like to have two sound cards on my desktop systems: The on-board one, which I dont care about, and a good one with a good DAC. The music I listen to is fed to the good card, which then feeds the amplifier. All other sound generated by the system goes to the on-board card. In 2004, and also in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, there was only oneI repeat, oneaudio player that allowed you to select a non-default sound card for its output and at the same time met some basic requirements like proper gapless playback and good UTF-8 support. That was Quod Libet. The option was not exposed in Quod Libets GUI; you had to search for it, and then pass it to the program as a command-line argument. But at least there was one program that supported this simple thing. However there was another issue: Because of a bug in ALSA or the kernel (dont remember which any more) the sound devices of the system were enumerated at random upon booting, with the result that 50% of the times the audo player had the wrong card selected upon starting! :-) So, after some time I got tired of struggling with the system in order to listen to music and abandoned the idea that I would use Linux as my main desktop system. I dont know how much better things are today, but I would not be surprised if such problems remain.<p>I still use Linux today but only on my auxiliary desktop system (Debian Sid). I also use Debian on my laptop for a simple reason: I use the laptop for about 5 to 10 hours a week for a narrower set of tasks, and the high maintenance requirements of Windows seem to me too much for that. Debian, even Debian Sid with its occasional hiccups, is MUCH easier to maintain.<p>Now, one could say that the one issue I say prevented me from switching to desktop Linux is an edge case. It may be. But I am afraid it is only one of the many edge cases that are frought with problems on desktop Linux. Desktop Linux in my eyes is a heap of edge case problems. Not everyone is affected by every problem, by everyone is bound to hit upon a serious one at some time or other. The two exceptions I know are folks who use their machines mainly for developing for the vibrant Linux web ecosystem, and folks who need their desktop/laptop systems for a narrow set of basic tasks.",1335110533

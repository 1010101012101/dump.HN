That way, you at least know what is <i>significant</i> to the current app in the current mode, and don't have to try a bunch of things.<p>Though in some respects, it is unfair to criticize touch technology based on its initial use in phones, because those screens are <i>small</i>.  Some of the article's goals aren't practical on a small screen, e.g. GUIs have ""discoverable"" interfaces because of always-visible menus, but a phone can't do this without seriously reducing usable screen space.<p>On the other hand, the touch screen of an <i>iPad</i> probably <i>should</i> fix more of these problems.  For instance, an iPad app can probably have a discoverable ""menu bar"" like a Mac app does, and not really hurt usable screen space.",1275116377

1388462,comment,1387883,1387883,0,0,jrockway,,,"I have to agree with this.<p>The reality is that testing everything before you even write it locks you in, emotionally, to a certain design.  (""If I clean up this module, the bar goes red!  Ahh, fuck it!"")<p>You end up writing the code to <i>make your tests pass</i>, not the code to <i>solve your problem</i> in the best way.  Without any iteration during the design phase, you're not going to get the right design.  At that point, you don't care if you get the right answer, you care that you have the framework for getting the right answer.  Once you like the design, then you can worry about making sure it works (sure, use TDD for that).<p>Now, the reality is, people that are forced to use TDD weren't going to come up with a good design anyway, so at least they have some idea that their code works and can change it would losing too much sleep.  Fine.  But when you aim for 75%, you get 75%.  I like to set my sights higher.<p>(I use TDD approximately never, and I have hundreds of thousands of lines of code in production that never give me a headache.  They are tested, but they were <i>designed</i> first, not tested first.)",1275115415

1388460,comment,1387043,1388196,0,0,tsally,,,"<i>Fair enough, but there's nothing overtly weaponizable about communication technology.</i><p>Reliable and secure communication technology is what enables the military to function. Without it, all the weapons technology in the world wont do you any good. So on a moral level, if you are against war you should actually find working as a researcher on communication technology more reprehensible than working on weapons. On an intuitive level I would guess that the breakdown or compromise of military communication has resulted in a greater loss of life than advances in robotics.<p>The reason why I'm pointing this out is that the real world isn't as simple as ""a bunch of dickheads trying to strap guns to [robots]"". You're making a simplification because it's convenient, but that simplification is morally inconsistent with approving of DARPA's work on the Internet. The fact that technology has a dual use is something we all have to deal with as researchers. But I don't think it helps matters by treating the issue as a binary.",1275115226

Smart people have a tendency to overcomplicate things and be so suspicious of ""superficial"" indicators. The assumption is that it really can't be so simple, you can't make snap judgments based on how they run interviews, you need to do some sophisticated analysis or something to really know. They end up being deceived by not wanting to be tripped up by naive conclusions and trying to look deeply, so they miss what's staring them in the face.",1275114014

1388440,comment,1387928,1388005,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"Disclaimer: My FC internship starts on Tuesday, so I can't promise complete impartiality.<p>I had the chance to contribute to Chromium as part of a class project.  It was super bitching.  I got to communicate and ever have discussions (virtually) with some brilliant google guys and put some code in.  Even got my name on the AUTHORS list.<p>My biggest contribution was changing the way they did metahandles in sync.  You see, when a 'synced' bookmark item is updated in a transaction, it must be marked 'dirty' so that it can be pushed to the server when the cycle comes around again.  This was an O(n) operation, as they scanned the whole set of metahandles to do this.  I just added some things to the WriteTransaction class to add it to a much shorter list and spare the effort of the whole scan at the end.<p>Now, I haven't worked at Fog Creek yet, but I have (coincidentally) built a bug tracker before (high school internship; I have no idea why I was given that task, in retrospect).  Granted, I was a high school student so I did an awful job with it, but I did learn a lot about how to make software (I'd hope) and it was pretty cool.  One thing in particular comes to mind which is that I had to add multiple-parameter sorting, and so I figured out how to do that (I had no idea libraries and even successive merge sorts would accomplish the same thing) and they were happy with what I made.<p>I guess my point is that a feature is a feature is a feature.  Most of the REALLY boring stuff is present in ANY software project, and a lot of the REALLY interesting stuff is present in almost anything (COBOL and banking applications aside).<p>(Chubby, BigTable, etc are super sweet though)",1275113817

If you read the terms, you are required to do either of the following:<p><pre><code>    * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is\n         used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\n    * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n</code></pre>\nHow is needing to provide a mention of the LGPL'ed libraries and the fact that they are LGPL'ed in any way screwing you? You also have to provide a copy of the GPL and LGPL amended your own legalese. You are not required to distribute the source for the library, nor the source of your own application. I've seen several large commercial applications make mention of included libraries, some under the LGPL, and it has never bothered me, nor anyone else who purchased it.<p>I understand that you want to be able to charge money for the software you write, but that you seem to perceive the LGPL as a threat to this ability seems excessively fear-mongery.

Their entire tool set (Rails) is open source, and they make millions.  Keeping Rails closed source was not necessary for their success. When you pay for a 37signals app you pay for their reputation and quality.  If someone else made the same application a year earlier, it wouldn't sell nearly as well.  Saying that you need to keep your software closed source is overvaluing the software.  That's only a small piece of what makes a successful product.

I'm running this software locally, and I want to be free to do with it as I will.<p>However web application software has the local component (JS) and the server component.  The software that is running on the server is clearly not being run by the end user and therefore the notion of freedom is not so clear.  Sure, we can make it ""free"" by releasing the source of the server code, but setting up a server may be non-trivial.  Or it may be useless without the data from the service.  Maybe the user's data could be released, or maybe it's intertwined with other user's data.<p>The point is, I care very much about freedom of software in general, but having free javascript by itself is essentially useless to me in the vast majority of cases.",1237765454
527652,comment,527500,527500,0,0,azanar,,,"Apart from the political squabbling, the feasibility of implementing something that ""detects"" JavaScript released under a free-as-in-freedom license seems tricky and error prone.<p>The suggestion in the article that you put a license delimiter and then parse the text of the license seems error prone; not because the license is particular difficult text to parse, but because text parsing in general is a rather fussy and fragile enterprise. And someone could put after the licensing tag ""Just kidding, here's the real license..."" which the parser wouldn't catch, but someone litigating a case of copyright infringement would.<p>Maybe I'm not being imaginative enough, but I can't think of a way this is feasible with just the client attempting to glean licensing on its own.<p>Having a global registry of free JavaScripts wouldn't solve the problem, either. Assuring correct URL parsing in every case is a risky thing to rely on for such restrictive behavior, and nothing stops the web site owner from renaming the free script to something else, or renaming one of his non-free scripts to the same name as the free script. Verifying file hashes wouldn't really help, since the free script is allowed to be modified.<p>Regardless of the political ramifications, the feasibility of this seems really questionable.

I guess that makes sense if you anticipate most people being referred from a search engine to a specific node, but if you're thinking they're going to be hitting your homepage, then I would probably get feedback by dropping users there first.<p>On that note, I would definitely work on the homepage a bit.  Add in some pictures of people doing outdoors things (rock climbing, hiking, boating, etc.)  Get people excited about doing something outdoors.  I get that you're going for simplicity here, so obviously accentuate the search box (maybe make it and the search button a little bigger).  Also, more contrast with the nav bar and background...green on green doesn't really set off the most important elements on the page (logo/brand and main navigation).  Maybe also list further down who this might interest (hikers, backpackers, kayakers, etc.) and tell why.

Featured Content, a little more interesting, but still not the first thing I'd click on (if I click at all), Park Index is getting better (I can equate hikes to parks) and finally About Trailbehind, which is probably what I am going to click on if I don't immediately do a search.  Move that up the priority list, and downplay some of the other stuff that isn't relevant to first time visitors (or make it clear why it is relevant).<p>Login:  I know it seems logical that if you want to register and can't find where to, then you would click login.

He sees everything through his 'free software' glasses, the same way a dyed-in-the-wool communist sees everything through his Breznospecs. It's not enough for him that a Google Docs javascript file be free (gratis) – he objects that the file is not easy to read and has no comments. The fact that removing unnecessary white space is a commonly-used practice in speeding-up page loading is not mentioned, even in passing. Seriously, what is this guy on?<p>I have in mind a special device for Stallman, Raymond and the other open source nutters. It consists of a big plastic bag that envelops their heads and into which is pumped the aroma of roasted coffee beans. It is required that they use this apparatus until such a time as their eyes light up and they utter the required phrase.<p>Today, more than ever, we live in a world of economic reality. In the recent past it was easy to find some chump to lend you all the money required to buy that house/car/tv you really couldn't afford, or finance your startup based on a 10 page deck and the words “web 2.0”. But things have changed. And perhaps for the better.<p>The open software movement cares more about its users than it does its developers. Hacker kudos doesn't pay the fucking rent. I want to know whether all the people writing iPhone or Facebook apps would have tried so hard if they knew their expected return would be exactly $0? Somehow I don't think so.<p>We've got to move away from this notion that software should be free (gratis). If you use it and can afford to pay for it then why should I give it to you for free? Note: I'm not arguing against open-source, I'm arguing against working for free. If I spend a great deal of time writing a funky database application and big_multi_national dumps Oracle in favor of my code and saves itself $20million in the process, why shouldn't I get my sniff? Seriously, why not?<p>If the same code is used by some charity or someone's personal website then I'm happy to tip my hat and say 'glad to be of service', but not if they're Coca Cola, or Hertz, or... (you name it).<p>If there existed a fair and balanced why of rewarding open source developers then I believe the whole sector would explode with a level of commitment and energy that would dwarf the already impressive achievements seen by the community.<p>That time has come.<p>It's time for revolution's founders to retire gracefully, and for a more realistic (though still ethical) guard to take its place.<p>David Semeria\nMilan, Italy",1237764388

You need at least some description as to what you are all about, even though it seems obvious to you.<p>- Have a key for all of the different icons that show up.  It may seem obvious that a notebook is information about something, and a water drop is a river/stream/etc. but it won't be obvious to everyone.  A followup to that is to show more information when I hover over an icon.  Showing me a name when I hover over a waterdrop doesn't do me much good.  Tell me it's a stream, river, lake, pond, puddle, etc. as well as its name and why I would want to know that this exists (the point of the website is to find places to do things outdoors, right?).  Tell me that I can go fishing or boating on a lake.  Whitewater rafting on a river with rapids.  That sort of thing.<p>- Clicking on an icon adds a point, but it's not altogether clear as to why it does that.  I would expect it to show additional information (which it apparently does in the floating pane...I'll get to that momentarily) but why do I need multiple points?  And reclicking on a point does a reload of the page?  Again, just make it blatantly clear why some of these actions occur.<p>- The floating pane.  I totally get why it's there...you need some sort of window to display detailed information about all of these different icons, but let me hide/minimize or close it if I want to.   The title of whatever I click on looks like it's in an input box, which makes me think I can edit it...which I can't.  Make it look like a title not an input box.  Additional, if I've clicked on an icon and want information on what that is, then just show me information for that point.  If there isn't any, then don't show the point.  You'll quickly have a bad user experience if you have lots of points with no content. (It appears that there is a user generated content aspect to this where people can input information about a point, so this may be a tough balance...maybe have a toggle to add content to the map, but hide points with no content if you're just searching)  Give me the option to view other related/interesting areas in proximity to this, but don't default to that if there is no content.  Also, clicking on the title of a nearby/related trip report should show more information in the pane about that trip report, not take me away from the site to somewhere else.  Let the URL at the bottom do that, or have a link to the source website.<p>- Your homepage (the place that your Home link goes to) just goes into a continuous loading indicator when searching on my zip (21045).  Are you planning on having people drop onto this page when going to Trailbehind?  If not, why have it if you already have a location search on the map?  If it's an About page rather than Home, then call it that, not Home.<p>- Eventually do some geolocation to default the map to a point close to the where the user is accessing Trailbehind from.  Defaulting to a location in Ghana does not help me at all (no offense to the country of Ghana).<p>Anyway, there were just a few thoughts after a quick glance through the site.

Between the 1934 National Firearms Act, which prohibits the sale of fully automatic weapons to those who do not submit themselves to an extended (months&#x27; long) background check and pay an additional $200 tax stamp, and the 1986 National Firearms Act, which make all fully automatic firearms manufactured post-1986 non-transferrable to citizens means that the fair market value of an M16 is something closer to $15,000-$20,000, and that&#x27;s for a used model that&#x27;s at least 25 years old.<p>If those acts were repealed, I agree that the suggested MSRP for an M16 would be ~$1,000-$2,000.",1396274369

A well diversified portfolio should have a mix of bonds including commercial bonds.<p>The disclaimer in the paper points this out:\n<i>Bonds are represented by long treasuries (Ibbston) which should not be interpreted as a full sample representative of the bond market.  Different asset class proxies will have different results.</i><p>The data that I&#x27;ve seen on stock-bond correlation shows a pretty consistent negative correlation over the 1927-2010 time period.

The important thing is that you can catch them in testing. I don&#x27;t value static typing very highly because type errors show up quickly. Pass the wrong type, and execution fails.

Nothing wrong with a lower risk capacity - maybe you need to work your way to managing higher risk<p>2. For short term goals (< 3yrs)- choose very safe investments as you cannot afford fluctuations<p>3. For long term goals and retirement - taxation is just as or more important than returns - interest income, capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed differently.

There are a number of ways to deal with taxation, best to find a good investment adviser who has a good understanding of risk management, taxation etc.<p>5.

My Sony 1080p HD TV that I have to unplug the HDMI cable any time I want to watch streaming video on my Sony Blu-Ray player.<p>3. Vegas Video, which was far too expensive of a piece of software to (A) treat me like a criminal for having made the mistake of actually paying for it and (B) spending two weeks pleading my case after I upgraded my PC for the third time and the software insisted that I pay for it again.<p>As a rule, I avoid products who&#x27;s DRM schemes I am forced to use. You can&#x27;t always avoid it, but my PDF collection is unencrypted and, though I assume that Sony isn&#x27;t going to suddenly add DRM to those files, I can only go by their history and the fact that there&#x27;s not really any evidence that they&#x27;ve learned their lesson, only that they got caught and like most companies, prefer to avoid the negative press. Even <i>Microsoft</i> has toned down the implementation of their activation schemes. Remember when a PC would deactivate resulting in a 3 hour usage limit and the disabling of Aero? I have a PC that hasn&#x27;t been able to talk to the licensing server for a year and all I see is a subtle Genuine Windows message in the lower right hand corner, a nag when I start Office and a message in the title bar. It&#x27;s a little annoying since these are legal enterprise licenses on a tablet that I just haven&#x27;t used VPN on in a very long time, but the software still works properly.<p>This kind of product requires me to grant Sony a certain amount of trust. Sony flushed trust down the toilet with Vegas Video and two Sony products failing to negotiate a proper HDCP handshake without physically unplugging cables. That would have been enough, but I don&#x27;t even have a metaphor to describe what they did when they chose to take a medium with <i>no</i> DRM scheme and <i>hack</i> a user&#x27;s PC into inserting one much like ransomware does with people&#x27;s word docs.<p>I&#x27;d have no room to complain if I plugged that device in and it b0rked my PDF collection because based on history, what else should I expect?<p>*EDIT: Grammar",1396272707

That, LINQ is developed entirely through extremely generic extension methods. Indeed, extension methods were added to C# to enable LINQ, which was created to drag .NET developers over to FP.<p>Extension methods are great for writing anything that chains a lot of method calls together, specifically because they aren&#x27;t methods on the object. Because it&#x27;s possible to call an extension method on a null instance, you don&#x27;t have to inject arbitrary error handling in the middle of your call chain. You can do it at the function site.<p>That said, there are a number of places where LINQ doesn&#x27;t chain very well. It&#x27;s built-in aggregating functions, for one. Average, Sum, Min, etc., don&#x27;t know how to handle a 0-sized collection. And of course, those functions are notionally not defined for 0-sized collections. But I think a better design is to allow the user to specify a default value in the case of a 0-sized collection, or to just return null (signifying &quot;there is no Average, there is no Sum&quot;), rather than throw an exception.

7501202,comment,7500896,7500896,1,0,stygiansonic,,,"Firstly, I&#x27;d recommend this book:\n<a href=""http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads&#x27;_Guide_To_Investing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads&#x27;_Guide_To_Investin...</a><p>It&#x27;s easy to grasp and straightforward.  Some basic ideas from the book:<p>1) What is your timeline? You seem to have multiple goals/timelines (car, retirement, home) and you need to define each clearly so that you can save for them in the proper manner. Needing money in 5-10 years for a house going to present a different goal than needing it in 30+ years for retirement. Generally, the shorter the time-frame, the less-risky the investment. If you need it in <=5 years, I would stay away from equity, but that is me.  Once you know your goals and timeline you can figure out what kind of expected return you want to target.<p>2) Risk tolerance: You touched on this, but again, you need to clearly define what you mean by &quot;I don&#x27;t want to risk too much&quot;. How affected would you be if your investments were down 30% in one year? Would you hold or panic and sell to avoid further losses? Answering this question is a lot easier to do when you haven&#x27;t lived through a huge market drop. (People tend to overestimate their tolerance for risk)<p>3) What is your financial situation? I assume no debt if you&#x27;re saving 50% of your pay each month, but if you do have any debt, you&#x27;re probably better paying that off before choosing to invest. Talking a financial planner (who isn&#x27;t trying to sell you product/services from his/her institution) is a good way to figure out a plan in this respect.  I would also ensure you have a decent emergency fund - depending on your situation, 6 months is usually enough.<p>4) Other assets: If you have a decent 401k match (as you indicated) this gives you a little more flexibility since you already are saving decently for retirement.<p>5) Taxes: This matters a lot and tax rates for different investments can vary quite a bit. I&#x27;m not familiar with US tax code so again, this is something you should talk to a financial planner or accountant to understand.<p>Having said all of that, I&#x27;m personally pursuing a passive, asset-allocation plan.  I&#x27;m mostly invested in Vanguard Index ETFs with a percentage allocation of bonds, US equity, Canadian Equity (I live in Canada) and International Equity that I feel is comfortable for me. I chose this mainly because of the low-cost/low-MER (Vanguard ETFs have even lower MER in the US) and went passive because I don&#x27;t like to have constantly make adjustments to my portfolio.<p>Most of my assets are invested for long-term capital growth, but I have separate accounts for an emergency fund and saving for a real estate purchase where preservation of principal is my concern. (high interest savings account)",1396271734

There is a tendency for something to seem &quot;easy&quot; or &quot;obvious&quot; after the fact, but this is ignoring all the insight, effort, and risk it took to find that initial successful path to the solution to begin with. Take a look at the Occulus Rift for example.<p>You&#x27;re right, you didn&#x27;t explicitly say that Oculus Rift is an example for a system that could be patented because it is more complex than it seems. But if I had wanted to make the point that I believe it <i>is</i> patentable I could have phrased my argument in the same way as you did to imply it <i>implicitly</i>.<p>> Why are people incapable of comprehending an argument as presented, rather than attempting to make connections that do not exist in the text?<p>Because communication is always context dependent. It&#x27;s easiest to see in the extreme ends, for example math, where you invent an entire sublanguage / dsl for precise communication and <i>still</i> your definitions change with the context you are working in: Does a ring contain a multiplicative identity element? Which operations is the homomorphism homomorphic in? We leave out these details, because most of the time it helps communication because everyone is on the same page as you anyway and those extra bits and pieces distract from the core argument.

I don&#x27;t tend to work at places that resemble the movies so don&#x27;t find trading any more or less stressful than any other job.  One thing that is different is that in trading you are always aware that 1 bad day can end your job, but I think that&#x27;s true in most places it&#x27;s just more explicit in trading.<p>The pay off is getting to work on interesting technical challenges and those technical challenges can be trivially linked to the success or failure of the group.  As far as compensation, I make about the same as what I made when I was writing software for a software company.<p>I got started by being recruited to join a group, but it isn&#x27;t some secret society or something.  Trading groups are advertising positions like anyone else and they hire at lots of different experience levels.",1396271088

I&#x27;m 100% into mutual funds and honestly I should just switch over to the index you&#x27;re using, emacdona (I&#x27;m also at Fidelity). Everything I&#x27;ve read suggests indexes do at least as well as funds, and it&#x27;s truly &quot;set it and forget it&quot;.<p>About the car: I agree that 60k is ridiculous, but don&#x27;t get the Honda. Get a car you like. Or do get the (used) Honda, and also a car you like. I bought a 2007 Z4 Coupe for less than 24k back in 2011. Taking her up to the track is literally the most fun I&#x27;ve had in my life, and it&#x27;s emerging into a full hobby as I&#x27;m trying to get into ChumpCar this year.

(And they weren&#x27;t risk averse, this was loseable money that they wanted to maximise potential return on)<p>My point was: for UK-based investors with small pots of money, these schemes basically give you free money (if you only invest up to the limits for tax relief). While, yes, they are much riskier in terms of company sucess/failure, the scheme negates most of the real risk and removes taxation on the rewards. The government is basically hedging your bets.",1396271014

7501125,comment,7500837,7500957,2,0,wavefunction,,,"Sounds incredibly resource intensive.  First, the sheer number of &quot;open-source&quot; projects which grow whenever someone has a new idea or some frustration with an existing solution.  I guess you could try to limit the tool to a list of established projects but that of course limits the effectiveness of what you&#x27;re trying to do.  Established projects may be more attractive as a delivery vector due to widespread adoption, but there&#x27;s also more eyes looking at the code giving a potentially higher chance of discovery of any exploits.  And new projects have less-deployment and potentially more active contributors who might more easily catch some exploit slipped in.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem that you&#x27;ve got how many languages you need to scan against?  And no quick way to determine what language a project is implemented in?  Sure, you could add some sort of language detection in there but then you&#x27;re adding to the overhead.<p>Finally, if the project has any sort of real complexity, some of the best areas to exploit would be in the integrations between two technology surfaces.  Writing a tool to look for problems in a single contained module is one thing, writing a tool that can find problems in the interfaces between modules is quite a bit more complicated.<p>I think your &quot;anti-problem&quot; scanning tool would be the best avenue to pursue though.  Maybe some sort of tool that would run on &quot;checkin/pull-request&quot; and look for issues like introduced buffer-overflow potential and things like that.<p>I think it&#x27;s just easier to rely on solid projects with &quot;known&quot; contributors to police themselves and hope for the best, as bad as that may sound.  Still, if you could create such a tool you&#x27;d make a fortune and improve the world immensely, so don&#x27;t let my nay-saying stop you.",1396270938

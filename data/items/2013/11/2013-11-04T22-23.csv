You can have an LDL of under 150, low triglycerides and your cholesterol ratios can be stellar, but if your absolute HDL number is low, there&#x27;s a good chance your doctor will talk to you and, at a minimum, recommend ways that you might be able to bring your HDL level up.<p>One common approach of doing this has been to use niacin, yet a 2011 clinical trial involving the use of niacin in an attempt to increase HDL levels in a high-risk population failed to produce the hoped-for risk reduction despite the fact that the niacin <i>did</i> increase HDL levels[1]. A larger, more recent study had a very similar outcome[2].<p>One logical possibility is that the HDL level reflects some other underlying factor which controls for risk and doesn&#x27;t itself have the ability to influence risk. If this is the case, a higher HDL number may confer little to no protection unless it is the product of some other natural process.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nih.gov/news/health/may2011/nhlbi-26.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nih.gov/news/health/may2011/nhlbi-26.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/03/09/niacin-wont-help-may-harm-heart-patients-study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/03/0...</a>",1383605942

For starters doctors are good but not super people. The amount of time you can allocate yourself can mean you win via quantity over quality.<p>2. Tragedy of the commons. Tests that might help you don&#x27;t necessarily help society. Tying up a machine that helps people with cancer hurts society but might have a benefit to yourself. What you want is different to what your doctor wants.<p>3. Doctors are not specialists.

I do it all the time and quite often use the device for a bit without any &quot;Google&quot;. The experience of running barebones AOSP is way, way closer to stock Android than anything you will buy from an OEM. I even sometimes do it and forget to install the Google apps because it is so similar you cannot actually tell the difference until you try to use something like Gmail or Google Now. The idea that consumers buying branded phones are somehow being deceived because they think they are getting stock Android but Google has somehow slipped proprietary code in is laughable when you look at what the OEMs do in comparison.<p>I would challenge you to get hold of a Nexus and flash plain vanilla stock Android (to make things easy, use CM 10.2 and don&#x27;t put Gapps on there). These are built from source directly derived from the AOSP, by people who are NOT members of the OHA and have no special relationships with Google, manufacturers or anyone else. You will find you can set up your email, calendar, pretty much everything you need, with the exception of Maps is available. It may make you feel better about things.<p>In my view, what is happening lately is that Google is drawing a sharper boundary around what is open source Android and what are proprietary Google services. The OS is remaining open source, as a hard condition. Things that belong in the OS are staying there and staying open source. But the layers above that - things that are rightly and properly user space apps - are only delivered as part of the OS as a convenience. Making better versions of those - possibly better versions than can ever be made open source, either because they depend on proprietary / live Google services (eg: maps) or because they use licensed or patent encumbered code - is fair game.",1383605281

Just create an operating company that you lease the condo to under a long-term lease - run all the money through the operating company, pay the rent to the owner, and distribute net income.

If someone else finds a block before you find your second, go ahead and publish.<p>Since by hypothesis you have a minority of the total computing power, usually someone else will find a block before you find your second.<p>But by the time you become aware of this, at least some other miners are also aware of it, whereas no others are yet aware of your block. With the &#x27;first wins&#x27; tiebreaker, usually that means your block gets lost. So most of the time you lose out.

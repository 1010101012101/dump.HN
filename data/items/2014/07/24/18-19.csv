Local boards of realtors controlled the flow of information on available properties, making it very hard for people to buy property without giving a 6-7% commission to agents and brokers.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean the market can&#x27;t get still more efficient, but having a nice presentation of public data is definitely worth appreciating.<p>I&#x27;d also add that real estate agents can provide substantial value. Many don&#x27;t, of course. But buying a house is an enormously complicated transaction, with a lot of legal, financial, and material complexity. Buying a business is even more tricky.

Essentially, it&#x27;s the database used to manage listing information about a property which has been entered by the realtor handling the sale of a property.  In the &quot;old days&quot; you could really only find out about properties for sale by looking in the newspapers, or speaking with a realtor who could search for-sale properties in these databases.  There are thousands of them in the United States, and you generally need to have a realtor&#x27;s license to gain access to your local MLS.<p>MLS&#x27;s can choose to syndicate their data to third-parties using services like ListHub or Point2 - but usually stipulate that the data must always point back to the listing agent so they stay part of the selling process.<p>Companies like Zillow and Trulia have challenged this model.  Increasingly, they&#x27;ve become the de-facto starting-point for real estate research.  They&#x27;ve built more-user-friendly interfaces, and surfaced public-records information along with property listings in order to present a more-compelling way to buy and sell houses.  Furthermore, they&#x27;ve done this while positioning themselves as advertising companies so as not to upset realtors or make them feel as-if they&#x27;re being cut out of the process.<p>The big complaint realtors have had with Zillow and Trulia usually centers around two concepts.  One is &quot;stale&quot; data.  The typical claim is that once data is syndicated from an MLS through a syndicator like ListHub to a site like Zillow things may have changed on-the-ground and the data may be stale.  Another complaint is that Zillow&#x27;s business model is built on the backs of the work realtors have done.  They source all the information, and Zillow earns money from redistributing that data.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service</a>",1406227577

Penney, which turned out to be a huge disaster. Ackman reportedly lost ~$500 million.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m not saying that Ackman is <i>not</i> a smart man based on one failed investment. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that he was 100% correct about the need for J.C. Penney to change, but it&#x27;s one thing to identify a need for change and another to make the right change. If you execute well the wrong strategy, you&#x27;re still going to fail.<p>The problem with Burger King is that what you call &quot;a well defined playbook&quot; is far from a <i>proven</i> playbook. There has been a trend in the restaurant business for chains to reduce the number of stores they own, but as a percentage of all stores, Burger King has basically dumped all of its company stores.<p>Today, that gives Burger King a financial profile that investors can cheer, but the company&#x27;s ultimate success depends on what happens tomorrow. There are more reasons than not to believe Burger King&#x27;s strategy will hinder and not help the company over the long haul.<p>If I was an investor in such a competitive space, I&#x27;d absolutely bet on companies being led by a visionary leader like Steve Ells (founder and CEO of Chipotle) over companies being led by former Wall Street folks with little to no restaurant experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970203335504578086363514686362"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405297020333550...</a>",1406227101

When I wrote code, the main benefit of emacs was that it abstracted me a bit from the nuances of different IDEs for different languages / platforms and was good at generalizing interactions with the compiler / errors / objects.  A really good IDE would be better at many certain things than emacs, but emacs was marginally better all around.  I used it for C, perl, and a little C++.<p>1) &quot;the kitchen sink&quot; thing, which is commonly cited as a drawback, is (to me) emacs most compelling feature.  If this isn&#x27;t compelling to someone, then a lot of the rest of emacs probably won&#x27;t be, either.<p>There&#x27;s a learning curve to doing everything in emacs.  I&#x27;ve written some guides on it before to ease the transition to starting to use it (basically introducing a few very important basic concepts that introduce major and minor modes, keybindings, and how to investigate those and customize them), but when you have that core understanding down, when you realize that you can apply those same concepts to everything you do - it&#x27;s incredibly, incredibly powerful and you understand why people want to live in emacs.<p>eshell or shell-mode for your shell interactions is amazing.  searching through a shell buffer with emacs&#x27; regexes or incremental search is fantastic.  Running your whole shell in that buffer and being able to run simple but useful commands like &quot;occur&quot; (essentially letting you grep through multiple preceding lines of output) is something I use all the time.  The commands to jump up / down through the buffer to prior prompts in the shell history - all of that stuff is great.<p>Similarly, using dired (directory editor) as my shell browser is great.

Unfortunately due to injury I couldn&#x27;t train until the last month.  I ran 4 miles, 13 miles, 16 miles, 16 miles, one weekend after another.  All very slowly.  Then I tapered and did shorter runs, resting the week before the marathon.  On Marathon day I hit the wall around mile 18 and trudged the last 8.<p>Fortunately for you, you have more than a month to prepare!  You&#x27;re also already halfway there.  The key is that once you&#x27;ve done the distance, you keep the endurance for a very long time.  So you just need to up the miles each run, then taper off to rest before the race.  You don&#x27;t need to do a full marathon before the race, but a few miles short is fine.  The last runs, work on speed.  Don&#x27;t do any long runs two weeks before race day, so your legs are fully recovered.<p>After that, the main thing to worry about is simply staying hydrated and not overheating.  The main reasons people drop out of races is because of these two reasons.  It&#x27;s rarely because you&#x27;re out of breath or your legs are too tired.  You can push through those, but not heat stroke and dehydration.  You will also need to eat salt or salty foods along the way to replenish.  Get used to running with a pack and/or bottle.",1406226158

The worst that&#x27;s happened so far is he got a few tweets not meant for him. He&#x27;s not going to lose any business or reputation because a conference has the same name as him. He <i>already owns</i> the .com domain and has the twitter account for the name. I could see if they tried to make some move to steal his domain by trying to vulture a lapsed renewal, or sent him a C&D for use of the name, but basically their big crime was to have chosen the same name for their developer conference as he uses as his internet handle, and <i>maybe</i> they knew there was some guy who uses the same name.<p>Name collisions are going to happen. There are a limited number of cool names.

8081173,comment,8080442,8080884,14,0,x0x0,,,"The logic here appears to be that since the employee is deemed to have paid the government on the day that an employee receives his or her paycheck, the employer is holding those funds in a trust for the government, to be remitted quarterly.  The government appears to believe in Monteiro&#x27;s strategy: &quot;Fuck you, pay me.&quot;  So you -- as an officer, an employee who pays bills, possibly a board member, or possibly other related parties -- can be <i>personally liable</i> if, for example, you used money from that presumptive trust to pay <i>any other bill</i>.<p><pre><code>   Although Internal Revenue Code Section 6672 includes officers, partners, and \n   employees, it does not exclude other individuals or firms that that can be \n   held liable.  The IRS will first try to recover payment from the responsible \n   persons with the most liquid assets, but will also concurrently hold as many \n   people as possible liable, each with joint and several liability for this \n   100% penalty.  There is no presumption of innocence in trust fund tax \n   situations. In Skouras v. United States, the court determined the assessment \n   on a responsible party is presumptively correct and issues relating to \n   willfulness could be resolved at the summary judgment level. The individual \n   has the burden of disproving by a preponderance of the evidence, the \n   existence of one or both of the elements that is willfulness or \n   responsibility. [1]\n</code></pre>\nhere [1] are some interesting horror stories:<p><pre><code>   Aside from the persons normally thought of as being responsible for these \n   taxes (CEO, CFO, President, Secretary, Treasurer, partner), the courts have \n   given fairly wide latitude as to which entities or individuals the IRS can \n   assign responsibility to. In 1987, the United States Supreme Court held that \n   the third party liability for trust fund taxes was affirmed against a lender \n   who paid employees’ wages with the knowledge the firm did not intend or \n   would not be able to make timely deposits of the trust fund taxes. In 1985 \n   the courts found that a lawyer, who had power of attorney from the owner to \n   operate a car dealership, was found liable for the 100% penalty. In another \n   case the IRS determined that workers were incorrectly classified as \n   independent contractors and assessed the 100% penalty to the principals of \n   the firm. In a 1984 Revenue Ruling, the IRS stated that a volunteer member \n   of a board of trustees for a charitable organization can be held liable for \n   the 6672 penalty. In 1978 the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \n   determined that a general contractor was responsible for the trust fund \n   taxes not remitted by a subcontractor. An accounting firm was held liable as \n   a responsible party because it had failed to remit a client’s trust fund \n   taxes and paid creditors other than the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS \n   deemed the friend of a business owner responsible because he paid some \n   utility bills for the company, extended loans or pledged collateral on loans \n   to the company.\n   \n   Imagine the shock when the IRS levied the Individual Retirement Account \n   (“IRA”) account of an officer of an S corporation and then included the \n   proceeds of the levied funds in the taxpayer’s Adjusted Gross Income for the \n   purpose of determining his earned income. The IRS used the constructive \n   receipt doctrine to conclude the amount levied from an IRA was a \n   disbursement – it had to be included as income. The taxpayer was further \n   refrained from deducting it as a pass through loss or a necessary business \n   expense. This is just a sampling of the many cases involving withholding tax \n   liability and the long arm reach of the IRS’ “responsible party” strategy. [1]\n</code></pre>\nLike I said -- you can pretty fairly characterize this as, &quot;Fuck you, pay me.&quot;  Where I to own a business, I would strongly consider creating segregated accounts to hold the funds owed to the government.  In fact, it would be nice if I could create a way to just pay the government every other week along with payroll so I would have no owed-to-the-government funds on hand to create temptation...<p>[1] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2306636_code411303.pdf?abstractid=2306636&mirid=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2306636_code...</a>",1406224918

Growing up in various places around the world I encountered a number of people for whom their motto was &#x27;its only illegal if you get caught!&#x27; The advantages of this motto were very apparent as a teen, you could run a stop light at 11:30pm, there was hardly anyone around, and you could be home by curfew. You could use your parents car if it was back where they expected it to be when they next needed it. Sort of the ultimate Ferris Bueller.<p>And then I had as an influence my Grandfather, who was a US Attorney, and who valued his integrity over his own life. I think of him as sort of the other end of this spectrum.<p>I asked him about his unwillingness to do what others have done (at the time it was drive faster than the speed limit on an empty road) and he said, &quot;Charles, the world is full of pain and anguish, when a man lives by a code he can walk among that pain and anguish and help right its wrongs without being burdened by having contributed to it.&quot; (well that is how I remembered it, there was probably a story about hunting in there too) and I didn&#x27;t really understand it until much later.",1406224896

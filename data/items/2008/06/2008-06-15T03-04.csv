217883,comment,217858,217874,0,0,bprater,,,"I don't think you have to take it as a all-or-none deal.<p>Often, I'll outsource small sub-projects that I know would take me more time than I can budget for that aspect or because I don't want to sidetrack myself from the marketing aspect of my business.<p>For instance, I needed to extract data out of a Firefox plugin that used SQLite. I really didn't feel like unraveling the schema and putting together the core SQL statements to extract that data the way I needed, so I had an outsourced developer hack it together for me for $50.<p>It probably took him about 5 hours to put together, so if I value my time over $10/hr, it was money well spent. (Especially when working on marketing parts of my business, my time is worth wayyy-y more than $10/hr.)",1213502031

Regular expressions. (raise hand) Who likes to write their own giant deterministic finite automata to do string matching?   Heh.   It's weird — nobody raised their hand.<p>So, something about people not wanting to write their own compilers?",1213501396

Its stupid easy to add one of these: <a href=""http://octopart.com/search?q=dc+to+dc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://octopart.com/search?q=dc+to+dc</a> to your circuit board along with a 4 diode rectifier bridge and support a dizzying array of different inputs all at once.

217872,comment,217781,217781,0,0,tom,,,"This guy's reading choices aside, this is further proof that Amazon takes their recommendations very, very seriously and understands that good recs = revenue.  B&N - I'm not sure what they understand.  B&N just doesn't seem to get it.  Their Book Clubs could be great communities - if they were about community, not selling books (the sales will come folks!).  And frankly, think outside the box folks.  A recycled forum is just so lacking.  The good thing about B&N is that they can often get the book there faster than (non-prime) Amazon.  But when it comes down to it, I still do most of my nerd purchasing at bookpool.  They don't try to recommend or sell me anything, but what I buy from them, they get right, and get it to me fast.",1213499758

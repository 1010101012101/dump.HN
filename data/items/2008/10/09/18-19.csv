I recommend just whitelisting the parent directory, as opposed to the root.<p>These types of restrictions do not apply when the content is served over HTTP, ie., as with the live site.<p>(I write and maintain SoundManager 2, which is a JS + Flash sound library as used in this nifty demo - I'm honored. :P)",1223578685
328134,comment,327427,327427,0,0,vombatus,,,"Well, if you reread the original email threads where Eliezer challenges people to an AI experiment, you will see, that at least one of the opponents is convinced that there is not way for an actual AI to talk its way out. So any arguments of ""but we should convince people that AI can talk its way out of the box"" can be countered with ""No, I don't think it can"".<p>I have been thinking about AI strategies for this. One of the more promising lines I came up with is to try and convince the Gatekeeper that the box is faulty. That the AI, in its infinite wisdom found ways to circumvent some of the protections of the box. That while the risk to humanity if AI is let loose is theoretical, there are definite and catastrophic consequences to NOT letting it loose. There are all sorts of variations to this, but it all depends on the Gatekeeper role-playing honestly.",1223578665
328133,comment,327937,327937,0,0,jmatt,,,"There are bigger things in the global economy than the opinions of Sequoia. This may not be very popular to say here. It is likely companies like Sequoia got burned worse than many other businesses. Money that funds them comes from investments like the stock market which has lost ~ 2 trillion dollars in value in the last few months. On top of that the last thing most big companies are thinking about are acquisitions - let alone IPOs. I understand their pessimism but I don't think it necessarily applies to the whole economy over the next 15 years.",1223578660

328091,comment,326897,326897,0,0,RobGR,,,"Firstly, think about if you really need to do this.  Will a single line to a telephone that has an ansering machine suffice ?  How much of a ""professional"" image to have to give to telephone callers at this point in time ?  Fancy phone systems are one part of the ""playing office"" trap, where by people get fascinated by the stuff that makes you look like a ""real business"" and proves to yourself that you are ""serious this time"" and start spending time and money on furniture, unnecessarily fancy space, etc.<p>Also, for most businesses, time on the phone is unproductive time.  I think that many offices would benefit more from spending money on a cell phone jammer than they would on fancier phones.<p>That said, if you have broadband internet then you can set up a PBX box for nearly free.  Here is how I do it: I use <a href=""http://trixbox.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trixbox.org/</a> or <a href=""http://freepbx.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freepbx.org/</a> to get an already-configured asterisk setup.  The hardware requirements are so low as to be free.  I provision with vitelity.net or a similar company; vitelity allows you to pre-pay, so you can keep your costs very low when you are in the initial stages.  For phones I use a combination of desktop software phones (only good for people who make few calls) and the cheapest, lowest-featured Grandstream brand IP phones.<p>The FreePBX / Trixbox stuff has a web interface, and the IRC channels are very helpful (if sometimes snarky).  You install the software, go to the IP address in a browser, and configure everything from there.<p>The setup should take one afternoon.  If it takes longer you are doing something wrong, or maybe you should just pay someone from craigslist $100 to come by and set everything up, and then occasionally call them to add new lines and stuff, which they should be able to do remotely.<p>In spite of my anti-phone observations above, the FreePBX/Vitelity setup will have the following features a startup might find useful:<p>* All calls can be recorded, and accessed via a web interface -- just check that option.  (Note this has legal implecations -- I think you should be fine if you tell all your users that the calls are recorded, and tell them to always tell any person they are talking to that they are being recorded if that person asks.)<p>* Voicemail can be delivered as a wav or mp3 attachment to your email, and there is also a web interface for browsing and listening to your voicemail.<p>* You can get a text message when someone leaves a voicemail.<p>* You can forward an internal extension to another phone, allowing someone to work from home but still get calls.<p>* You can send faxes and receive them via email as a pdf or tiff file.  The VoIP providers generally do not guarantee enough quality to do faxes, but it works well enough.<p>* You can go into Vitelity's web interface, add a 1-888 number to your account, and have that number go to a special voicemail account.  This allows you to try out a custom advertising method quickly and see if it works.  You can just cancel the account after a month, and the whole experiment will have cost you a couple of dollars.<p>I have set up a number of systems like this and I could do it for you if you are in the Austin, TX area.  However, there is no reason why any reasonably technical person should not be able to set it up in a couple of afternoons, and I recommend you do it yourself.<p>Or just scrap telephones.  They are an inefficient way to communicate for most of what they are used for, and a waste of time, and a distraction.  Make some money instead.",1223576527

Just as we can't be sure how Eliezer is interpreting the rules, future AI researchers can't be sure how valid the results of the experiment are.  Since the meta-argument depends on the results of this experiment convincing these researchers, the meta-argument shouldn't be accepted.<p>Heck, if the gatekeeper player is shown that the meta-argument exists, he should realize that the researchers will also come up with the meta-argument as a likely explanation for the AI getting out of the box, leading the researchers to further disregard the results of the experiment.  Eliezer would do just as well to argue that a loss would discourage him from further safe AI research, or that the $10 forfeiture would deprive him of valuable research-related pizza.",1223576065

(This probably doesn't actually need a cluster.) We're looking at evolutionary relationships between protein families.<p>I just started a graduate program, so I'll have to do a range of things for classes -- which is why I have some leeway to pick up a new language and stagger through a few numerical programs now if it will help me get things done quickly later, when it matters.",1221966872

Here's a bit that could use updating for our modern age:<p>Encouragement to advertise when you've got something good:<p>""In a country like this, where nearly everybody reads, and where newspapers are issued and circulated in editions of five thousand to two hundred thousand, it would be very unwise if this channel was not taken advantage of to reach the public in advertising. A newspaper goes into the family, and is read by wife and children, as well as the head of the home; hence hundreds and thousands of people may read your advertisement, while you are attending to your routine business. Many, perhaps, read it while you are asleep.""<p>Is there a modern equivalent?  Television?  Still?  Is there any one thing that truly touches entire families today?",1221966179

(Granted, this is probably easier for, say, Intrade than for something like SL.)<p>But they probably thought of that and were somewhat specific about the allowable types of insurance.<p>edit: I went and read the relevant text of the act. Especially in light of recent events, I find it amusing that Congress couldn't come up with a definition of ""gambling"" that inherently excluded derivatives trading - they had to do that explicitly as well.",1221966168

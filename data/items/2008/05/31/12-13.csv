If nothing else this does seem to indicate there is some validity in the myers briggs tests.<p>The total lack of S versus N is also fascinating. (for reference I started life as an INTP when I first did this 20 years ago, a few years ago I was an INTJ, now today I'm an INFJ, not sure what this means, maybe I'm mellowing with age)",1212238644

It's the whole point: people with different personalities are supposed to show up differently on the test.  It's not clear to me why you seem to think that the claims for the test are actually claims against it. :)",1212238539

205228,story,,,15,5,antirez,"I together with other four friends just launched our new site: smuvi.com (more info in the comments)",,"Hello, http://smuvi.com is the result of 3/4 weeks of work five people did in order to create a movies-based community here in Italy. We never worked together in the past but we are friends since we were childs. The average age is 30.6 (max age: 33, min age:26)<p>The site is written in Ruby using mod_ruby. We used our own framework. We tried at our best to make the site scalable from the start, the home page is generated (without caching) in 40 ms, the film detail with 50 comments in 50ms.<p>One of the most interesting things in the site is in our opinion the recommendation engine: you get user-tuned suggestions after you rate a few films. Another interesting thing is that if you search in smuvi you get results from film transcripts too.<p>I'm not sure if I can get feedbacks for a site in a language different than English but... I'm trying.<p>Thanks in advance for any kind of hint.",1212238260

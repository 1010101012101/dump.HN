We seem to repeat our mistakes somehow allowing ourselves to be under the illusion that it is different this time around. A lot of people don't seem to believe what she is saying is true and actually believe in the contrary that the current crisis is because of free market capitalism.<p>What most people don't know is that we didn't have one in the first place. Fannie Mae was a Govt. Sponsored Enterprise, started by FDR, and is one of biggest problems in the present crisis. Various Senators and Congressmen were pressuring Fannie Mae to make these horrible bets on the real estate market. This is not an isolated case, the government has been interfering in the market a lot more than it should have and in a bad way.",1224439159

I would bet on it still being somewhere in another 2000 years.<p>My point is that housing technology is nothing compared to demand for good locations in terms of its affect on prices, and good locations have a lot of staying power.<p>BTW, those marshy areas in Lazio have been fairly marginal for a long time:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agro_Pontino"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agro_Pontino</a>",1224438880

Recently, we did a massive upgrade to our forum software (the most used part of our system), changing the look, some of the feel, and some of the functionality in one fell swoop, and with the instant change, there was quite a revolt from the userbase.<p>Luckily, were able to quickly revert much back to begin incrementally making the changes to little effect.  Had we kept it like that, given the response from the users, we could have lost some long customers.<p>It was our mistake for making such a huge change in one massive patch, but we've learned from that mistake.",1224436931

It seemed useful for a while, but then the signal to  noise   ratio is was so dismal I started dropping people from my ""follow"" list.<p>What may be of real value are the assorted tools and sites that have spring up around it, where I can get more targeted datage.<p>I'm a fan of serendipity and the use of noise to disturb mental stasis  but there's a limit to how much self-absorbed minutia I can wade past.",1224436555

Ted’s usual style is to write cruel things to mischaracterize other startups, largely writing nasty things to make them look bad, feel bad. And yes, mostly all that he wrote was personal. Careful analysis my ass.<p>Ted writes: “My priorities have changed. I am now facing fatherhood, and I want to do what is best for my family.”<p>And these guys whose startups you delightfully enjoyed tearing into pieces, did they not have their own families that they have to support? Some of them may not have children of their own, but do they not have an aging father and mother who just needs some financial support? Perhaps a sibling that they are trying to help put through college?<p>EVERYONE has their priorities. If you think you’re the only one who faces shifting priorities in life, you’re just plain dumb.<p>Ted writes: “This is horrifically irresponsible on Michael’s part, but that sort of thing is to be expected. Michael, you should be ashamed of yourself.”<p>Ted, you’re known for not exactly being that friendly to startups. Your notoriety is infamous, such that your ill intent is more that “sort of” to be expected - it’s pretty much ALL that anyone can expect from you when you open your mouth. It is you, who should be ashamed of yourself.<p>Last but not least, Arrington’s contribution to startups is at best, <i>a lot</i>, and at worse, greater than zero. This is an unbiased FACT. Ted’s contribution to startups is at best, approaching zero - but largely, negative. A large negative number.",1224436263

337156,comment,336635,337017,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"This is purely anecdotal evidence but many of the elevator pitches I saw were from companies and individuals that were adapting their ideas to the fb app paradigm.  Facebook is a great distribution channel for any company really, especially when they are giving you a 25,000 dollar grant to build on their platform.<p>I discovered YCombinator several weeks ago in a blog post about the fbfund/YCombinator meetup written by a July 2008 fbfund recipient. A link was posted prominently on the fbfund Facebook page for at least 4 weeks.  This was the only centralized place for fbfund discussion and updates so a lot of applicants checked it regularly and may have found their way to the YC website.<p>Maybe the demographic data destroys that theory though.",1224435657

35584,comment,35564,35569,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"From my experience having a German wife and visiting Europe yearly (which is limited experience but helpful), many Europeans genuinely believe that the government can do things better than private groups.  The evidence for the validity of this belief speaks for itself (not valid).  In Europe, security seems to be one of the highest considerations in taking action which leads Europeans to have far more trust in large old corporations than in untested and untried new companies.  The exceptions to this view are Eastern European countries like Czech Rep, and Poland and Romania, etc.",1184939529

If you get that right, the rest will follow. They shouldn't be using tax dollars as venture seed money. They'd be better off refunding it to the taxpayers!",1184939475

35579,comment,35542,35542,0,0,whacked_new,,,"IMHO captchas still have their place. Any type of turing test would require intervention by the user. I dunno how low the threshold of annoyance is for most users, but I tend to think that ""reproduce this text"" produces a lower cognitive load than, for example, ""what is 4 + 3."" If your text is extremely jarbled that's a different matter... note to self.<p>Picture matching is a viable alternative and can reduce cog load, but it also increases the time between captcha and the intended action. I use a 3-character captcha. We'll see how that holds.",1184938873

While I've seen plenty of articles come to press that has somewhat inaccurate quotes, this was the first time I've been completely misrepresented in an article.  I've written a full post on my views here - <a href=""http://sethlevine.typepad.com/vc_adventure/2007/07/setting-the-rec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethlevine.typepad.com/vc_adventure/2007/07/setting-t...</a>.  It's particularly frustrating in this case, as I've spent literally hundreds of hours working with TechStars and TechStars companies in Boulder this summer (and am the lead mentor to one very promising project). I actually believe strongly in the model.<p>I hope you'll consider posting this response up to your main site with a reference to my post clarifying my views.<p>seth levine

35573,comment,35015,35535,0,0,pg,,,"No, I don't think they contradict one another.  The reason is that the most likely outcome is just to the right of the step.<p>Most startup founders (initially at least) hope to get a few million, and wouldn't risk that to get a few billion.  That's the step.  And the most common form of liquidity event is a small-scale acquisition that gives the founders just that level of wealth, since otherwise they won't sell.  So in the most common (and most commonly hoped for) good outcome, happiness varies linearly with the number of shares.",1184937061

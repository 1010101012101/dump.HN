9013620,comment,9004689,9008202,0,0,jabl,,,"In my experience, when you&#x27;re doing technical computing you spend <i>a lot</i> of time exploring your data (or some representative test data set) and doing quick one-off analyses. So an interactive environment with good plotting capabilities etc. is invaluable. See the success of things like Matlab, R, and yes, python (particularly IPython + the rest of the Scipy stack).<p>Secondly, since a lot of techical computing involves multidimensional arrays, you want good support for them in the language. Which means some kind of array syntax such as Matlab, R, python/numpy, etc., and also that they are efficiently handled behind the scenes (one array instead of nested arrays somewhat popular in C code).<p>So in the end, there&#x27;s not a whole lot to choose from if you&#x27;re not willing to sacrifice any of the two above features. One language I&#x27;m excited about, Julia, is a bit special in that it tries to combine the high productivity of such high-level interactive environments with C/Fortran-like high performance. The language itself is really nice, IMHO, but of course the surrounding ecosystem is so far much less mature than that around scientific python.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m also excited about Rust and I hope it will have a bright future, also in technical computing. Though I believe where Rust would be most useful, compared to Julia, say, is for writing low level libraries that can then be used from any language with a C FFI, as Rust doesn&#x27;t require a big runtime with GC and whatnot.",1423305226

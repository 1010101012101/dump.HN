1147712,comment,1146998,1147423,0,0,abrahamsen,,,"The GPL can't force Valve to release source even if they had used GPL'ed code for an external release.  However, a court could force Valve to stop distributing the infringing binary, and to pay damages to the owners of the GPL'ed code.<p>It is possible that Valve would choose to release source for the steam client after negotiation with the owners of the CPL'ed code instead, but that would require agreement from both parties.  And it is actually not totally unlikely that Valve would seek such a solution, the steam client represents a very little part of the total value of steam, the main value is in the content of their rights database, and in their reputation and connection with gamers and publishers.",1267008952

This is why I based my startup in London and now I'm relocating to another country.<p>To add something more to this piece of news: Google, with YouTube, is disturbing our televisions, owned or controlled by our prime minister Berlusconi, by competing with them and spreading news that are hidden or distorted in TV. This will not be the last attack Google faces from Italy.<p>News Corp. knows this very well. In the last year this government passed some laws clearly against their satellite offer, favouring the TV channels of our prime minister. Now it's the turn of Google.",1267008718

Because you can change the text size, actual page numbers themselves completely change.  The numbering system that the Kindle uses is based, from what I can tell, on words/sentences/paragraphs.  It took me ages to figure out that ""1237-48"" meant ""From 1237 to 1248"" and not something like ""1237.48"".  It's horribly communicated, but it makes sense when you figure it out.",1267008137

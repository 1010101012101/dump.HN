After thinking and discussing it with some non-technical people, though, I realize it&#x27;s not a contradiction unless you also assume some physics knowledge.  I (and probably you) have so deeply digested the fact that a pen and a heavy boot fall at the same rate that it seems like a logical failure to not incorporate it into a conclusion.  It&#x27;s quite possible that a person&#x27;s understanding is simply inconsistent (at the frontiers of anyone&#x27;s knowledge i think inconsistency is quite common; &quot;learning&quot; is largely a process of finding more data and working through implications to resolve them), but it not a foregone conclusion based on these answers.<p>This is the main challenge in teaching people any technical subject - discovering the basic knowledge you have assimilated so deeply that you can&#x27;t even imagine that others don&#x27;t share it.",1385657711

6815163,comment,6812499,6813251,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"3-10x is, of course, intended as a 95%-of-cases interval with some basic assumptions. Some contexts (e.g. type of problem, engineer, timeframe) will be below 3x and others will be above 10x. (The 99.99% interval is probably 0.2-100x.) Among those basic assumptions is that the engineers have the curiosity, drive, and ability to learn it. Ability is the least issue of the three; if they&#x27;re not smart enough to learn Clojure, they&#x27;re not smart enough to Java or C++ <i>well</i>, and they&#x27;re mostly making messes.<p>Lisp has a bad reputation compared to what it is. People think it&#x27;s impractical, that Lispers are arrogant (due to a few vocal but influential people in the Lisp community) and that it&#x27;s archaic or weird. I&#x27;ve addressed those perceptions, but they&#x27;re out there. Clojure is, in fact, a pretty damn practical language.<p>Now, the arbitrage argument: in larger companies, the concerns aren&#x27;t engineer productivity so much as appearances. For a middle-manager to launch a meaningful Clojure/Lisp initiative would be to put himself out there in a major way, and since programmer productivity is only one piece of a much larger system, it might not have that big an impact on the company as a whole. It might not be worth it. (Would Google&#x27;s market cap go up 3-10x if it replaced Java with Clojure? Almost certainly not. Maybe the fair value would improve by 1.05x on fundamentals, which would be drowned out by month-to-month volatility.) On the other hand, startups generally can&#x27;t afford (or don&#x27;t think they can afford) to experiment with newer, quirkier languages. VC-funded startups tend (surprisingly?) to have stodgy closed-allocation work cultures and boring tech stacks <i>because</i> they&#x27;re expected to allocate 100% of the &quot;risk allowance&quot; to one department: business-model risk. That&#x27;s not to say that there aren&#x27;t other kinds of companies that can (and, in some cases, do) use more innovative tools; but the two dominant cultural forces (VC startups and large corporations) in technology don&#x27;t favor it.<p>For the large companies, I&#x27;ll admit that there&#x27;s an Amdahl&#x27;s Law sort of effect at play. Let&#x27;s say that you improve productivity of engineers by 3-10x. Does that &quot;3x&quot; the whole company? As I alluded to for Google, probably not. It makes something else the limiting factor. For most firms, using the wrong programming languages is nowhere near their top problem. To use Google as the example, it might deserve a 5% bump on market cap if it included Clojure (a small gain compared to monthly volatility, so small that no one could prove causality and take credit) on the white-list but the fair value would go up 50-200% (again, on fundamentals, as I can&#x27;t predict investor opinion) if it implemented open allocation. Programming language innovation just isn&#x27;t the top priority for most companies. But for an individual developer, the advantage conferred by a powerful language can be pretty serious.",1385655960

The selling points are, as I see them:<p>- There are now more people spending money because they have disposable income. This is good for businesses.<p>- There is added incentive to work, because one does not lose income by starting a job.<p>- The people being made redundant by automation are given a cushion that will help as they figure out how to become economically relevant again. This is good for everyone, because there are fewer families forced out onto the streets, etc.<p>- There is, potentially, less of a bureaucracy to manage the distribution of existing welfare programs, assuming existing programs can be consolidated into the new basic income scheme.

6815071,comment,6812499,6813217,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I got really into Scala a couple of years ago, and then worked on a big Scala project. One of the problems is that if you throw average Java developers into it, and don&#x27;t give them the time to learn the language properly-- these were smart engineers, it was a lack-of-time problem rather than an ability issue-- you get a lot of Scala-in-Java. The code is just as unreadable, &quot;enterprisey&quot;, and unattractive as it would be in Java.<p>I would use Scala for a personal project where I felt I needed compiler-time typing: I was writing something for the ages, or where bugs might be truly intolerable (say, high-frequency trading) but code would remain small. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a huge project, though. (Then again, I generally wouldn&#x27;t recommend huge projects.)<p>Scala tends to fall down on large projects, especially if the developers aren&#x27;t skilled. Cyclical dependencies (yes, I know they shouldn&#x27;t exist, but they <i>will</i> if you have a team of 25+ engineers and a wide skill spectrum) defeat incremental compilation, which matters when your compile speed is ~500LoC/second (Scala&#x27;s compiler is <i>very</i> powerful). Also, SBT is a nightmare. I haven&#x27;t used Scala&#x27;s macro system but I can&#x27;t imagine it being as clean as Clojure&#x27;s.<p>I like Scala on its terms alone, even if I&#x27;ve seen it go wrong on large codebases. (Java has the same issues, but it has tools that rescue you. It&#x27;s an ugly hackish thing, to rely on tools to deal with code messes; but they&#x27;re there.) I like static typing (at least, the theory that comes from it.) However, I tend to think that what <i>most</i> programmers really want when they say they want &quot;static typing&quot; is something more like Prismatic&#x27;s Schema: runtime checks that can be turned on or off (performance) as needed.<p>I think Clojure&#x27;s easier to read and to write. It just looks harder, because people exaggerate the parentheses problem, which is not much of one at all. If anything, the only thing that&#x27;s somewhat hard to explain to newcomers is quoting (e.g. why &#x27;(1 2 3) returns (1 2 3) at REPL but (1 2 3) is an error).

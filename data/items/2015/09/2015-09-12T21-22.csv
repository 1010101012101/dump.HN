If the conversation continues, I will continue to discuss more with you.<p>Lets start with (A).  You are correct, the way I described it does not explicitly explain how it is intelligent.  Lets adopt the strictest definition of intelligence which is the ability to predict.<p>When I refer to capitalism here, I&#x27;ll be referring to capitalism implemented, not the theory.  Capitalism is intelligent.  It is made up of people which are intelligent.  These components are at times working together, and at times working against each other.  Much like your conscious mind and subconscious mind.  Conflicts are resolved in the market or through the state via legislation and trials.  The results of components working together and resolving their conflicts is how capitalism has decided to behave. Having behavior is not sufficient for intelligence.  A virus has behavior but is not intelligent.<p>So does a capitalist system make predictions?  One example should be sufficient to make the answer to this question yes.  If I can show that a capitalist system makes predictions, then I will have proven that it is intelligent.<p>Lets use America for this example.  One thing American Capitalism seeks is to mute the highs / lows of the inherit booms and busts in-order to increase the level of stability of the economy.  The Fed watches the rates of lending / borrowing to predict bubbles and raises interest rates to slow / stop the growth of bubbles.  Once it has popped, and lending/borrowing slows, the Fed then lowers interest rates to promote lending / borrowing.  I know this is not new info for you.  I just wanted to be thorough in my response.<p>So American Capitalism predicts bubbles and acts on those predictions. Thus, intelligent.<p>You might say the Fed isn&#x27;t capitalism.  Which would be true.  But your brain isn&#x27;t you yet it is the component which makes you intelligent.  The Fed is part of America&#x27;s capitalist system.<p>You might say that capitalism does not involve government.  Which I would say, pure capitalism doesn&#x27;t involve government, but the active capitalist systems we have today do.",1442094660

Absolutely.<p>I want performance, concurrency, efficient memory usage, and static typing. Ruby is lacking in all these areas. Go is mildly better, but is regressive in many other respects.<p>For me, Go is a step back in terms of productivity, but a step forward in creating stable, fault-tolerant code. It&#x27;s a compromise. Go feels like a stopgap solution until something better comes along.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve learned to design the internals of my code around a functional style that makes code composable and the data flow simple. Go doesn&#x27;t support that style, not really. Go promotes simplicity, but a lot of stuff that should be simple in Go isn&#x27;t &quot;simple&quot;. Like mapping and reducing an array.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that working in Go reminds me a <i>lot</i> of using Borland&#x27;s ObjectPascal back in the mid-1990s: A small, natively compiled (and super fast to compile), not-functional language with built-in reflection and a stupidly strict, cumbersome type system. Go makes very few innovations over ObjectPascal, and inherits many of its problems; Go&#x27;s notorious lack of generics, for example, caused <i>exactly</i> the same issues back then. And nobody should be surprised about that.<p>Currently, the language that looks closest to my ideal is Nimrod. Unfortuantely, it has almost zero mind share, and has a surprising amount of odd, off-putting warts for such a young language (perhaps not too surprising when you realize that for many years it was just one guy hacking away at it, TempleOS-style), disappointing since many design choices just feel just right, like someone has read my mind. Currently I&#x27;m on the fence with Nimrod. Jonathan Blow&#x27;s jai also looks promising.",1442094066

Genome sequence all human cancers so that we classify them by genetic defects. We should not care which tissue a cancer arose in, but by which drugs it is selectively sensitive to.<p>3. Test new treatments in patients that reflect actual patients - ie newly diagnosed patients, not patients that are weeks away from dying and who have failed everything else.<p>4.

Then we get artists renderings and theories about how this long-dead animal lived.

The article says they retrieved &quot;1 to 2 million base pairs of ancient nuclear DNA&quot; from fragments as small as 25-40 basepairs.

GPGPU computing is a way to increase effective computing power without advancements in semiconductor technology.  GPUs have a fundamentally different architecture that allows them to get much more processing power from the same silicon.  They work differently to CPUs (amortizing memory access latency across many hardware threads instead of trying to minimize it, sharing control flow across many cores to minimize that cost, and requiring manual control of memory locality) but on many domains including training neural networks, they are much more powerful.<p>So GPUs are certainly not a diversion CPU makers get into when they can&#x27;t make progress on CPUs.",1442093834

That would be interesting to know.

So it&#x27;s pretty hard to look at what people are spending in two different places for two different things, with a probably large subsidy involved, and conclude that a theory about supply and demand for identical goods in a free market is wrong.<p>Let&#x27;s put it another way: it seems that you must disagree with at least one of the following statements:<p>(a) Higher demand, ceteris paribus, means higher prices.<p>(b) A single-payer system implemented in the US would likely cover more treatments than the system that exists in the US today.<p>(c) Covering more treatments means more demand for treatments.<p>(d) A single-payer system would not shift the supply curve for treatments.<p>With which do you disagree?

We have to deal with the nature of humans and their behavior but besides that we can make up the rules and could at least in principle set them up in a way that yields a stable system. If it is possible in practice I don&#x27;t know, maybe stability inevitably leads to terrible inefficient systems or requires enforcing practically unenforceable things. But you are at least correct for our current system, there are several constructs that are not stable and lead to runaway behavior.",1442092279

That&#x27;s not a useful attitude if you&#x27;re trying to improve diversity.<p>It isn&#x27;t an attitude at all. It&#x27;s purely descriptive.<p>If you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s wrong to describe it as a meritocracy because <i>it isn&#x27;t one</i> then that&#x27;s one thing. If making the industry more diverse would also make it more meritocratic then that is clearly the way forward. But then what we need to do is not to stop calling it or wanting it to be a meritocracy but rather to make it live up to its name.<p>On the other hand, if it is (more or less) a meritocracy already then what you&#x27;re asking for is not that we stop calling it that, but that we stop it from being that. And if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying then say it clearly so that more people can disagree with you.<p>> Then the particular field or company has evolved to favor Caucasian males (or if you prefer the culture that is highly correlated with being &quot;Caucasion&quot;). In other words, it&#x27;s got embedded structural discrimination. If you want to improve diversity, that needs to be acknowledged and removed.<p>This is a really great exemplification of the failure of your entire line of reasoning.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose that, culturally, the parents of white and asian males generally encourage them to study engineering at university and the parents of females and african americans generally discourage it. In this not altogether unrealistic hypothetical this explains the main cultural difference leading to the disproportionate representation.<p>Then companies looking to hire engineers logically require that candidates have studied engineering. You call this structural discrimination and demand that it be removed. Companies are expected to what, hire engineers who have no knowledge of engineering?<p>Sometimes the problem is not the culture of the industry.

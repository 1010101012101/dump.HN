I'm Emil Hajric and Abi Noda is my partner, we're building workflo.<p>http://www.getworkflo.com and our blog, http://www.blog.getworkflo.com<p>Workflo is an easy way to collaborate with your team using a micro blogging platform. Workflo works on a very similar principal to Twitter. Our competitors(Yammer, Presently and HashWork) are cool but they're not really doing what we are. We're revolutionizing the way teams collaborate. We offer todo's, attaching files to your status-updates, and direct messaging.<p>With workflo, it's really easy to set a todo for your teammate. Check this out: ""@pg todo: Please see the applications for #ycombinator-project #next-friday"" will set a todo for PG telling him to see the applications for the project with the name ""YCombinator Project"" by next friday.<p>That's just one of the awesome features of workflo. There's a bunch of more cool stuff. We built workflo as a solution to our problem of collaborating and organizing our team online.<p>We're looking for a  good coder/designer. We're developing workflo in PHP/MySQL using the Kohana framework. We're different, we have crazy-good work policies(such as: We record our work, etc..check out blog for more info...). Shoot us an email at emil@getworkflo.com.",1257937160

It's a big mystery what Twitter's actual user engagement numbers are, so nobody really knows how sticky the site is. How do you know Twitter's approach is working? It seems entirely too premature to say.<p>Honestly to me it seems like either Twitter's user engagement numbers are really bad, which is why Twitter doesn't talk about them, or Twitter's analytics are so poor that they don't know how their users behave, which doesn't really reflect well on them either.",1257936544

Google is great for the user, but not for the content owner used to large revenues for said content.<p>Edit: Thinking about it, google really do ""own"" the worlds content; they monetize it for extremely little effort on their behalf. I love this, and so do you, but from a content producers point of view it's horrible. They used to be in control of distribution & now have to give a significant portion of the revenues they once had to a company who merely index the information, or others that make near-automated efforts to aggregate it.

935007,comment,933493,933816,0,0,bad_user,,,"Sorry, but it is very uncommon for Java to use 10-100x as much memory.<p>Those benchmarks are pretty irrelevant because all the algorithms in there are short-lived.<p>As far as I know CPython uses reference-counting for GC. And while this has definite advantages, this creates the potential for memory-leaks when using cyclic data structures. Also, the heap can get pretty fragmented, which for long-running processes can leave the heap looking like swiss cheese.<p>This doesn't happen with Java, but as a side effect a compacting GC usually allocates twice the heap size needed since it needs space to defragment the heap. The JVM's GC is also a Generational GC, separating generations in multiple regions, such that short-lived objects can be collected faster and newer objects can be allocated faster with speeds comparable to a stack allocation.<p>On Python, reference counting has the advantage of being cache-friendly and pretty deterministic. And when it comes to web servers that fork processes for requests, this is alleviated by the fact that the Python process has a short life.<p>On memory consumption, yes, Java might have the heap doubled, and the garbage collection is more non-deterministic. But it depends on your application ... the JVM ends up using memory a lot more efficiently for long-running processes, although the upfront cost is higher.",1257933823

Eventually I figured out that the module I needed was just broken, so I decided to at least update the documentation. As it turned out, not only was it not documented how to update the documentation (...) but I had to go back and forth on undocumented style guide rules (for documentation that gets displayed in the browser anyway!) and then sign the CLA, all to update a single line of text in the docs to say 'don't use this module, it's broken'. It literally would have taken less time for them to make the change themselves.<p>This soured me even more on node.js than actually using it had. It's bizarre that project maintainers would actively put so many walls between themselves and valuable (or not-valuable, for that matter) code contributions.<p>I can only assume that the legal downside to not having a CLA signed for every single-line commit is enormous. Are there previous court cases in the US where not having a CLA got someone destroyed?",1369792611

5784129,comment,5782704,5783981,20,0,dr_,,,"Yes, part of it is registering vets into the system. The other part is a combination of the enormous number of claims and enormous amount of documentation required. \nAs a physician, I worked in C&P (compensation and pension) clinics for a number of years at the VA, as a consultant. \nThe amount of documentation required is astronomical, likely because vets are being compensated for their injuries with taxpayer dollars. Fair enough, but a physician providing these services could find other ways to use their time productively (for themselves). \nThen there's the volume. You don't just see vets who have lost an arm or a leg or have suffered traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries. You also see the guys who may have sprained a knee or ankle playing basketball in their free time but while they were officially on duty. Throw that into the mix, and you have too many people to examine so thoroughly. They tried to fix this by contracting with an agency and have vets come into a private medical office instead of doctors going to the VA, my partner did this for a while, but the reimbursement offered for the amount of paperwork required ultimately made it impractical. \nTo fix it: \n1) screen vets better, some are clearly more severely injured than others\n2) better compensate providers who see all these vets and complete all the necessary documentation.<p>The screening part is tricky though, as it can quickly get political.",1369792550

I actually DO think that the quality of pull requests varies widely from project to project. You dismiss this in your first sentence but I don't think you should. I think there are a lot of reasons for this, but many can be reduced to: Some projects attract more inexperienced developers than others.<p>2. I don't think you can simply indict the project maintainers for not optimally leveraging the talent pool of volunteer contributors. While Open Source has been validated a million times over as a truly successful movement/concept/etc, nobody has ever accused it of being efficient. Specifically, most pull request submitters act on their own, without coordination between submitters or with project maintainers. It's not just an issue of coding standards, it's also things like the maintainers having a roadmap that includes bug fixes, refactoring, new features, etc, and that may conflict with Joe in Idaho and his pull request that he did to scratch his own specific itch.<p>In many ways community submitted pull requests are a ""million monkeys at a million typewriters.""<p>3. The most successful way of getting a pull request accepted, I think, is to first raise a discussion on the issue on the projects mailing list or issues forum. Link to your in-progress patch, say ""I have this fix here for problem X, can anybody take a look and tell me if I'm on the wrong track with this?"" So many of us are code-first, conversation-later types and that  constantly conflicts with the social nature of our job.<p>I guess my takeaway here is that there is a lot of room for interesting technology solutions to this problem, in the areas of:<p>1. Tools that help maintainers cultivate the submitters talent pool on their project.<p>2. Tools and workflows that help submitters through coordination. Totally a half baked idea but suppose if I'm fixing a bug in a function somewhere, Github can help me discover what is happening to that function elsewhere. Maybe it's been radically changed in a feature branch owned by the project maintainers, maybe it's already been fixed nearly the same way by another submitter who has an open pull request, maybe it was already submitted by somebody and rejected.<p>3. Static analysis that can power those tools and more. Would love a meaningful quantative quality score on the pull request submission page. Like an additional tab beside the ""Commits"" and ""Diff"" tabs. Maybe it could run various analysis on the code and show formatting issues, known vulnerabilities, known bugs, etc. Obviously the abilities here vary from language to language.",1369791435

Ideally, if I have a balance of $100 in my account and try to spend $60 in two different transactions, one should come back as failed before the purchases are complete.<p>Whether or not conflicting writes are a problem or not depends on the application semantics. For example, if I'm, just adding items to a set, then my updates commute. But if I have a constraint that says that elements in the set need to be unique, then my updates don't (logically) commute any more. Ultimately, this is application-specific. The ""CALM Principle"" (<a href=""http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloom-lang.net/calm/</a>, <a href=""http://vimeo.com/album/2258285/video/53904989"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/album/2258285/video/53904989</a>) captures this notion of ""logical monotonicity"" resulting in safe operation despite concurrency. Most of the applications I mentioned, like 2i updates and the social graph example, commute.<p>For non-commutative operations (and there are plenty), you'll need a stronger model like serializability or sequential consistency that necessarily blocks to prevent concurrent update (or otherwise aborts concurrent updates).<p>> My ideal database should be read-available at all times, but guarantee that writes are atomic and durable (and give up availability for this guarantee).<p>This is definitely one point in the spectrum; the question is whether you want to give up availability and write performance. But if you look at workloads like those in the Spanner paper, this is reasonable for many applications.<p>> What are your thoughts on quorum-based voting in distributed systems? E.g.: your protocol but with the requirement that a write is considered stable if only most (vs all) of the servers involved have it marked as ""good"".<p>There's a difference between quorums over <i>replicas</i> over the same data item and quorums over different data items. Using quorums over replicas would help ensure that the replicas provided properties like linearizability or register semantics like Dynamo or other systems that provide an option for ""strong consistency."" But it's not clear to me that quorums over replicas for different data items would provide the same atomicity property--does that make sense?<p>I intentionally left many of the issues of replication to the footnotes in the post--mostly for readability and clarity--but I believe the technique is applicable to both linearizable/""CP"" and ""eventually consistent""/""HA""/""AP"" systems.",1369790700

If I dont have some of the specifics correct, please forgive me.<p>One of the things that stands out in my mind is a few related pieces of advice, most of which are fairly good in isolation:<p>- prefer composition to inheritance<p>- prefer more smaller methods (as I said elsewhere, I believe that theres even a point where its suggested that a one-line method is ideal)<p>- prefer smaller objects<p>In isolation, each of these things is fairly goodbut when combined, you change from a codebase of large, unreadable functions, to an unreadable codebase of lots of little, tightly-coupled, smaller objects with smaller methods all composed into doing something that would be simpler to understand as a few medium-size objects and medium-size methods.<p>In Ruby, all of this isfungible is the best word I can think of for this. Because of Rubys duck-typing, mixins, and most importantly, lambdas and blocks, the best place for your logic to reside is as close as possible to where its being used. This doesnt mean write large methodsit means that all of the advice thats given for Java written before late 2008 (when lambdas were barely a twinkle in the JSR process and Sun still mattered) doesnt apply when you have anonymous blocks of code that you can apply immediately and functionally.<p>The best description Ive got for this ultimately is related to many of the things said about Gamma, et al.s <i>Design Patterns</i>: in other languages, design patterns are just features that the language gives you, rather than something you have to implement. Iterators? Built into Ruby, and better because of blocks. In Ruby, you dont need to learn the lessons given to Java programmers in 2008, because the language gives you more power and expressiveness already. Add a little bit of metaprogramming (in the same way that attr_reader/attr_writer/attr_accessor is implemented, for example) and youve got programs that express your intent clearly, but are nearly impossible to apply <i>Clean Code</i> to because youre doing something <i>smarter</i> (not <i>clever</i>, but <i>smart</i>).<p>To address the three points that I mentioned a couple of paragraphs ago:<p>- prefer composition to inheritance: good advice, but composition in Ruby also means considering how blocks and mixins can help you understand your code better.<p>- prefer more smaller methods: Im not as sold on this; the more methods you have, even if theyre private, the harder it is to understand just how your code works because you now have a larger API to understand. (And, like someone else in this conversation, Ive had to deal with 2+kloc functions in other languages; I just havent had that happen in Ruby, where the largest functions that Ive dealt with are in the low hundredsand those are very rare but <i>focussed</i> functions (e.g., a lot of error handling where you dont necessarily want to introduce state that lives outside of the function).<p>- prefer smaller objects: As with smaller methods, Im not as sold on this. The more objects you have, the more interface you have to remember, the harder it is to remember how to compose everything back into the logic youre trying to implement.<p>By all means, extract codeDHHs advice on what theyre calling concerns in Rails is <i>very</i> good (Ive already done that with more than a small bit of our current Rails application; Ive also done it with other code over time).",1369790459

And as soon as you skew your presentation of the issue, no matter how you rationalize it in terms of ""it's for their own good"" or ""I've spent a lot of time and effort on this, I know more than they do"", etc., etc., you're still, at the end of the day, substituting your judgment for theirs.

It does a ton of things and from what I've heard, it's slow as molasses because of all of the metaprogramming syntax that's built in. RubyMotion allows you to build iOS apps in Ruby. It doesn't seem like other languages get the attention that ruby does. It feels like a scripting language but gets the attention of a compiled one, I don't get it. Is it becoming the first programming language that some people learn? It's actually about the only language I don't know (and I know x86 asm, C, PHP, ObjC++, Python, Perl, C#, you name it.)

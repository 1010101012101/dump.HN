3348124,comment,3347720,3347889,2,0,msluyter,,,"When you think about it, for any any Scrabble-like game to be played competitively, it'll ultimately have to have a codified word list. (Every word needs to be judged as legal or illegal.) Make that list too small and confined to ""normal"" vocabulary and you make the game vulnerable to being ""solved"" by players who can memorize everything and/or, you make the game less complex/interesting.<p>Make the list too large, and you open the game up precisely to the this sort of critique -- ""it's all about learning arbitrary words like AA or ZEK."" Personally, I'm happy with the latter, as it makes the game deep and rewarding (I actually enjoy looking up words like ""zek."") But (competitive) Scrabble is its own world that needn't appeal to everyone.<p>If the arbitrariness of the Scrabble tournament word list bothers you, you might try house rules with your friends that limit words to those that are universally accepted. This is what I do when I play with my mom. I just know that I can't play QI or UNAU and play a less competitive, friendlier game.",1323795451

I've only heard of R and never used it, but I'm sure there are domains where it's the perfect tool for the job. You could potentially freelance to make some side income as well.<p>I think it's still a good idea to learn web development in general. It's such an interoperable medium. It's dense on the first read, but I recommend skimming RFC2616 (<a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt</a>) the HTTP protocol. It won't teach you to program any specific language or framework, but it's a great way to get a feel for all the pieces involved for a web app.<p>After that, I recommend taking baby steps and tackling each piece of the puzzle individually. Learn some html/css, build a portfolio page. Then take on some javascript and add some dynamic elements. Then add a backend for dynamic elements you compute server side. For learning coding, nothing beats practice. To improve, write something that solves you own problem, but also look for how other people implemented the same thing (github's a great place to see well maintained and well factored code)<p>Best of luck!",1323795444

The main idea is buying a surplus cruise ship and transforming it into office space for highly paid workers who can get a tourist visa but not a work visa for the US. Simply the work certification costs and the delays involved in obtaining H1Bs for all those people would probably offset a good deal of the cruise ship's price. The workers can conduct activities they are not directly paid for (presentations, informal meetings) on shore in the Valley, and commute to do all their programming/other directly paid jobs on board.<p>Unfortunately, it will not work, because the first politician who will see a potential for voter outrage about this will exploit it to bring the whole thing down, either by causing the shut down of the ship-to-shore infrastructure, by digging up / stretching some obscure tenets of immigration law to penalize the workers, or simply by having the Coast Guard overstep its attributions and seize the entire operation (which is usually how micronations end).

Even with Campfire and Skype, it can still be a challenge to keep everyone connected. It's not uncommon for an in-house dev to ask a simple question to the folks around him and have that question turn into a thoughtful conversation. Sometimes, we'll think ""Oh, fire up Skype and get so-and-so on the line so they can join in."" But many times, we just don't even think of it.<p>I hadn't heard of Sococo, but it looks intriguing. Keeping an open mic with Skype was something we considered, but it seems intruding. This is an area we're still trying to get better at.<p>The other issue is one of team-building. Usually our in-house devs go to lunch together and grab the occasional beer after (and during!) work. There is a camaraderie there because these guys work together, eat several meals a week together and drink more than a few beers together. That just can't be replicated to a remote developer.<p>We've also found that some devs simply aren't disciplined enough for remote work. They love the freedom, but sometimes that freedom becomes a problem for them. We don't keep devs that have to be supervised constantly, but when they are remote it can be harder to gauge if they are just hitting a slow, unproductive period that will pass or if they are just doing as little as possible to keep a check coming in.<p>Distributed teams are definitely a huge bonus for a company, but there are challenges that have to be thought through up front.",1323794868

You could store a scope-per-document, which is how it initially was....but, that isn't how it's modeled and, it takes a lot more space (user and leaderboard get repeated 3x, along with the index which is on those two fields).<p>Also, I wrote about collections vs embedded documents:\n<a href=""http://mongly.com/Multiple-Collections-Versus-Embedded-Documents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mongly.com/Multiple-Collections-Versus-Embedded-Docum...</a><p>Edit:\nI wouldn't rely on the age of a feature request as a sign that there's something fundamentally wrong with a design.

For years these apps have been tied to browser technology and their usability and features have been limited because of it. Sure it makes them easy to deploy (all you need is a browser), but in exchange you get crappy wysiwygs, lack of remote access (ftp, ssh), image editing that sucks and a string of other annoyances that we've simply learn to accept out of convention.<p>But when you think of it, there's no reason it should be like this. Organizations typically only have a handful of people that require access to the admin panel. You could simply have them install a native client that communicates with the server via http, exactly like the browser does, but offers a much more elaborate API. The added bonus would be the possibility to easily delegate various other tasks to other tools (Unix style).<p>Other normal web users (consumers) can continue to access the frontend (as opposed to the admin panel) via browsers.<p>This is a future I can definitely embrace.",1323793782

When you push yourself to get work done, you often end up putting that off for too long and your brain just hits back with a state of general confusion.<p>If that's the case - you finding yourself with a busy brain that seems incapable of finishing any thought - <i>Stop working</i> and allow it some time off to tie up those loose ends.<p>I have found that my brain has three modes of working when it comes to creative thinking - The first is in-the-moment thinking, where and work and thinking are one - Synchronous Thinking. The second is finishing up thoughts while I'm doing something else (literally, getting the results to a thought-process out of the blue) - Asynchronous Thinking. The final one is the one described here - Exclusive Thinking.<p>Learning which of those to employ at a given moment (based on your workflow and mental constitution) is an artform and hard to master, but just being aware of it is already a big step.<p>(And not to forget - there is also a fourth one - Exclusive Non-Thinking, but that's a whole different area of philosophy and more related to general mental balance than it is to getting work done.)",1323793181

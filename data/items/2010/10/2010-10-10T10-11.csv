1776914,comment,1776543,1776790,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"I'm not really sure what generalisations like yours bring to the table. I mean I've only been to maybe 5 or 6 states in the US, but I know that a city in Maine is so completely different from somewhere like New York or Boston which themselves are completely different from, say, Orlando or Las Vegas. So trying to make generalisations that hold for all 50 states in the US is even more ridiculous.<p>I guess an analogy is that Turkey is in Europe, and being a European it would be very easy for me to say ""the service in the US is way superior to the service I get in Europe"" and then I could add ""but at least in Europe I don't get someone telling me how much I should tip when I get the bill like I did in America."" But the truth is that the tipping culture is nowhere in America that I've visited like it is in New York and the standard attitude is actually very similar to the UK, which itself is way different to somewhere like Italy or Germany. But hey, let's not let the truth get in the way of a good discussion that is rooted in anecdotal evidence.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that the service you receive is based on a lot of things, the least of which is the country you are in. In fact the most important part of how well you judge the service you receive is you and your expectations. That is something I realised from similar 'anecdotal discussions' with my fellow Europeans when I rave about the service I receive in the US - ""they would never let your beer glass go empty for an hour like they do here!"" - ""yet but they also come over to interrupt you every 5 minutes to ask you if everything is okay.. when I need something, I will ask for it!""",1286707812

The Japanese are pretty fixed in how they do customer service (which has its negatives as well I understand), but often they do it better than any other place I've been.  2 quick examples:<p>1.  Even at places like McDonalds the cashiers are incredibly friendly and attentive.  They even bring the food to you if you go sit down.<p>2.  At the exit to a car garage I lived near, there would be a worker who would take your ticket from you as you pull up to the exit, and put it in a machine.  He would treat you like a king.",1286707708

Nobody buys a company and then closes it if what they want is to develop the product; they buy it and close it when what they want is the talent solely focused on their own, in-house projects.<p>Which is fine. It just begs the question:<p>How much would someone have to pay you to drown X months of development work and your entire userbase in the Deadpool?<p>It's an interesting question. For how many people is a buyout, a 9 - 5 job, and some 0s in the bank account a desirable, worthwhile exit strategy? How many 0s does it take to make an option that's viable into one that's desirable?",1286707560

The brute fact, though, is that that many market participants actively seek out ways:<p>A) to inhibit competition, or even prevent it completely, for example by anticompetitive business practices; and/or ...<p>B) to make the public pick up the tab for costs while keeping revenues for themselves -- think pollution costs and bank bailouts, to name just two examples; and/or ...<p>[EDIT:] C) in some cases, to flat-out lie, cheat, and steal.<p>FOOTNOTE: As I understand it, economists refer to B as privatizing profits while socializing costs, a.k.a. ""externalities.""<p>These human tendencies to do A, B, and C above appear to be fundamental facts of life. Left unchecked, they can have a corrosive effect on markets.<p>There's ample room for evidence-based debates about how best to deal with these tendencies. But it doesn't seem to have done much good to insist that free markets are a cure-all -- it's reminiscent of the old economist joke whose punch line is ""we'll just assume we have a can opener.""<p>> <i>Most government is coercion. I don't see how more of it is a solution.</i><p>It's certainly true that when government regulation is driven by untested ideology, or by private interests, it can make things worse by discouraging private initiative and effort. (Some of the ways market predators try to do A and B above is by encouraging government actors to enact legislation and regulations that favor them.) We've certainly seen that happen at various times in various places.<p>But governmental regulation, selectively applied, can also be at least a partial solution, to the extent it can help keep market predators from doing A, B, and C above.",1286706748

At all.<p>So, after fighting the battle for far too long I'm now rolling out git/gitorious right now, with lots of early adopters using that already, on my (properly backed up..) test machine.<p>The biggest issue that I've seen so far are mostly general ""I just don't get scm"" things (no commit message or a useless one. Working around rules by just entering space if I try to prohibit this).<p>The only git specific issue that come up is that the people don't understand that each user's clone/working copy is a separate branch of the origin already. If 2 guys clone from the ""server"", you now have 2 branches of origin/master. pull by default merges remote and local branch, which leads to a huuuuuge number of completely useless merge commands in the histories of some projects. That makes the history far less useful in my book and all visualizers now show you a large numbers of branches that you don't care about.<p>You can work around that by educating users to, for example, using git pull --rebase - but that is a concept that needs quite some understanding first.<p>Apart from the thing above the introduction seems to work fine so far and people with different background (VSS.., cvs/svn mostly) are using it without (real, major) problems.<p>And I'm glad that we finally will have an official scm server sometime this month, after only ~5 years of nagging.

I.e. I give them an address I've set up specifically for the purpose of giving it to sites that require one.  There's an awesome, self-explanatory site called 10minutemail.com that I love using; sites can ban their domain (I think some do) (but it's a new one every month), but there's no way a site can tell the difference between my real Gmail account and my crap other Gmail account.  And I think a lot of people use similar tactics.<p>In other words, requiring <i>an</i> email address doesn't mean users will give you their email address.  I only give my actual address when I want to.  Meanwhile, it's a pain when a site requires one, and sends me an email with a confirmation link.  I feel alternately clever (ha, I outsmart them) and sleazy (this probably isn't what they intended), and always annoyed, when I do this.<p>I recommend making emails optional (but if it has a definite use, like for resetting a password, then explain this to the users).  I was happy, kind of exhilarated actually, when I signed up on Hacker News and all it asked for was a username and password; the email address is a text field that one can fill out when desired.  I think I remember it explaining that this address wouldn't be visible in your profile; it would just be used for notifications about your account, or something.  Take note.",1286705429

At the extremes it makes sense, in that a company that runs out of money is worthless and a company that makes 14bn profit a quarter is worth something.  For the rest it is like popular culture / fashion.<p>The other problem with stocks is that if everyone is saving for the future via retirement funds then the market is inherently going to be over inflated and further illogical.",1391140759

But most people I&#x27;ve known don&#x27;t investigate or educate themselves much - it&#x27;s been a herd mentality towards AWS, irrespective of needs or costs (because often, it&#x27;s not them paying - it&#x27;s &quot;the company&quot;).<p>Perhaps as a freelance consultant right now I take a sharper look at the costs involved - if a client has, say, $50k to budget on a project, I really don&#x27;t want $10k of that to go to hosting if it doesn&#x27;t need to - I&#x27;d rather it be available for my services directly (obviously) or to give us more play for marketing, testing, whatever.<p>I&#x27;ve known a couple of small to medium sized companies where they were using AWS rather strategically as part of their services - dynamically spinning up test environments for running parallel testing, off-peak data crunching, etc - but even in those cases, there weren&#x27;t gigantic savings vs other options.<p>What bugs me most is the false dichotomy I get when I talk about this with friends; their choice is presented as either use AWS or &quot;hire a full-time sysadmin, buy multiple server-grade boxes and manage all this in a rented data center&quot;.

I went back and re-read the articles on the New York Times[1], Guardian[2] and Propublica[3] and I see something that I notice in just about every NSA revelation: they always mention that the documents in question don&#x27;t say how much of the communications of Americans or ordinary civilians were collected, but they also don&#x27;t give any examples of whose communications were being collected.  The Angry Birds articles would be more accurate if they said something like &quot;The documents did not reveal if any U.S. citizens were targeted, but did indicate that this information was being gathered from members of a middle-eastern terrorist organization.&quot;  But then, if they said something like that, there wouldn&#x27;t be so much of a civil liberties angle to play (in fact, it might backfire and draw some outrage to the news outlet itself).<p>Which brings me back to my original question - what&#x27;s in all of the other redactions?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/world/spy-agencies-scour-phone-apps-for-personal-data.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/world/spy-agencies-scour-p...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-</a>\ngchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data<p>[3] <a href=""http://www.propublica.org/article/spy-agencies-probe-angry-birds-and-other-apps-for-personal-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propublica.org/article/spy-agencies-probe-angry-b...</a>",1391138661

The truth is that we&#x27;re people too who have a lot of the same needs as &quot;normal&quot; people.<p>I think the author was simply trying to articulate a rift that sometimes occurs between a party with a (perceived or actual) problem and the party with solutions for that problem. According to his barbershop example, that problem/solution rift is the result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem statement. If I could abstract the article in one sentence, I would say, &quot;If you are trying to solve <i></i>a problem that you yourself do not have<i></i>, make sure you actually understand the problem from the perspective of the party you are solving it for before you go building things.&quot;<p>The author may have gone a bit far in generalizing programmers/engineers, but would you agree it is fair to say that it is easy enough for _anyone_ to fall into the aforementioned trap if they are not conscious of it?<p>An occurring theme I have noticed while speaking with people (not just engineers and/or programmers) is that we have a tendency to project ourselves on other people. I don&#x27;t think that is a bad thing in moderation (that&#x27;s a different matter of discourse), but I have had at least two different conversations with entrepreneurs where they simply could not for the life of them understand why someone would rather &quot;just get a job working for someone else&quot; than start their own company. It simply does not register in their world view that someone does not share their way of thinking. My anecdote is tangential at best, but my point is that the object of the article is not to diminish programmers. Rather, it is to elevate the perspective of those subject to a certain myopia that they would otherwise not think to confront.",1391138119

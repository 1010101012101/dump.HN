138136,comment,137704,137704,0,0,Tichy,,,"No, I don't like crashes and stuff. Thing is, Linux doesn't really crash anymore. And especially with Ubuntu, it does most things exactly right, no superfluous crap that just ends up getting in the way. For example, no spyware, because the apps I use are not commercial. That is why I use it.",1205671358

And from the above...<p>""But they seem just like a convenience to developers and an inconvenience to many users, and don't really make anything new possible.""<p>Not acknowledging your presumption that it's an inconvenience to users, the above could essentially be said about any AJAX/Javascript framework too.",1205670556

138128,comment,137924,137995,0,0,dbrush,,,"I have to disagree. I think you misunderstand what exactly an 'RIA' is. It's an application. From the ground up, and I can only speak on my experience with Flex/Flash, these are applications. Google doesn't index Microsoft Office binaries, why should it index text within any other application?<p>Additionally, right within the Flex dev environment there is an option to publish the source so a user can view it. Adobe is cool enough to automate this task where the end result is LiveDocs style documentation for your app. This is a decision left to the developer, not the underlying architecture of the shell it is running in such as AJAX/CSS/HTML within a browser which don't give developers a choice.<p>Lastly, do you actually think that Zoho(or any other AJAX/CSS/HTML application) will succeed or fail because one can view source? The users that matter just don't care.",1205669701

Being sickly, I was homeschooled for a lot of my childhood, so I didn't have a peer group to tell me what was cool for many years. I did interact with other kids through church and various activities like choir, but it wasn't very similar to social groups that form in schools.<p>My mother also limited my TV time. My dad didn't but only when we watched Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, and all kinds of other sci=fi stuff together. He also told me stories about robots. I did also love playing with my Littlest Pet Shop toys and dressing up as a princess, but I also loved building robots, spaceships, pirate ships, etc. with legos. I don't really understand why that stuff isn't more popular with girls. I mean, almost all franchises based on them have multiple good female characters and storylines that seem like they would appeal to women.<p>Based on later experiences as a teacher of 4-5 year olds, I get the impression that socially there is usually a queen bee girl who tells all the other girls who like different things that they are lame and they can't be in the club if they play with robots. I don't necessarily think that's a natural thing as the way schools divide children up based on age would be unusual from a historical perspective. I think having all 5 year olds together with no younger or older girls encourages bullying behavior as they establish a social dominance, rather than age-based, hierarchy.",1348239468

They match up investors who want to buy and sell the amount they want to sell at the time they want to sell it.<p>Contrast to the private corporation that I own shares in,  where it's taken me weeks to broker a deal to buy some more shares from another shareholder -- including face to face meetings with many of the officers of the company.  We had to have an accountant do the valuation and I ended up buying exactly the number of shares the other owner wanted to sell because this would mean more financing complexity and paperwork for the hardworking officers who should be spending their time building the business.<p>Maybe your broker gets $10 and the market maker gets $15 but this is a bargain when you consider how much it would cost without them.  Imagine trading on the New York Stock exchange when you were in San Francisco in 1860!<p>Many low latency (high frequency) traders are market makers.  Since the first successful offer gets the trade,  you've got to be the fastest to survive at this game.<p>One reason it's hard to make money as a trader is that as people find discover deviations from ideality and exploit them,  the deviations go away.  ""Market neutral"" strategies we quite successful through the 90's but are no longer profitable.

4554000,comment,4553658,4553817,1,0,larrys,,,"First let me say that I agree with most of Cuban's thoughts in general.<p>But by ""invest"" he is not talking about the friction out there (paraphrase as ""having to spend $400 and talk to a human"") to purchase a stock but rather the price of the stock in relation to the value being manipulated by, as one example, high frequency trading and macro economic conditions.<p>Let's say someone decides to invest in Bingo Card Creator because they think there will be a market in China and that Patrick and BCC are the ones to be able to take advantage of that opportunity. So they invest in BCC because as a small operation, and after doing due diligence, they believe the ""new chinese sales manager"" that you hired can crack that market. Regardless of what else is going on in the world or in China.<p>But the truth is even though the stock market is less like that analogy today, I don't believe it was ever like that. (Look at 1929 as one example). Of course in the past I do believe people did make more long term investments. There were places to put ""widow and orphans"" money. Not sure that is the case today anymore (is it?) And that could also be just because of friction in distribution of investment information - there were less places to read things about companies and that actually helped create more long term investments (my thoughts strictly).<p>The game now is that people attempt to predict by all means possible what will happen in the future by triangulating any info available to determine how a company will do. And then those companies become bellwether's of the market and people make decisions in advance of those decisions. While this always happened to some extent (I'm sure before people could fly airplanes over shopping centers or before there were even shopping centers there were people who attempted to find out how a particular company was doing by evaluating any information they could. I just think the amount of people doing that was in the minority and now the majority of people are making decisions for non-fundamental reasons.)",1348239366

4553991,comment,4553658,4553658,9,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Wall Street's business is <i>facilitating the capital markets</i>, not ""creating capital"". Equity underwriting, a white shoe Wall Street activity, involves simultaneously facilitating a series of transactions we call an IPO. Creating capital is not really anybody's job - you can create capital/money by agreeing to take an IOU in lieu of cash for services rendered.<p>Also, Wall Street != algo/program/high frequency trading. That area of the capital markets, which requires sophisticated market infrastructure to exist in the first place, is exceedingly small by headcount and profit share.<p>>""<i>The best analogy for traders? They are hackers.</i>""<p>Traders <i>are</i> hackers, and so are entrepreneurs. The kind that likes to tinker with data, play with mathematical models, and find nuances previously un-noticed or empirical anomalies irrational. The dream is to, in the process, find a way of modelling phenomena presently deemed unpredictable, i.e. to discover something new.<p>>""<i>Discussion in the market place is not about the performance of specific companies and their returns. Discussion is about macro issues that impact all stocks.</i>""<p>Adam Smith didn't write about economics, he wrote about the political economy. The post-War trend of having a secular divide between politics and markets is historically unprecedented. Discussion has shifted because the salient points have shifted; beta is dominating alpha. A visual could be a slick of oil on top of an ocean - the oil is company-specific factors and the ocean the general market. In calm seas just watching the oil is fine. If you're in a Hellenic thunderstorm, however, the dominating factor is the rolling waves. Don't blame someone else because your model is obsolete.<p>>""<i>I would be curious if anyone out there knows what percentage of transactions actually return money to a company for any reason</i>""<p>I'm not sure what this means, so I'll take it as what percent of revenues came directly from capital raises (IPOs and debt offerings). This supposes that all other functions at the bank, e.g. asset management, making markets in stocks, providing brokerage and execution services, etc. are useless. From their latest GS 10-Q [1] we see that they earned $1.4 billion in underwriting for the first half of 2012. Not including net interest income their revenues for the same period were $14.5 billion; thus, underwriting represented 10% of Goldman Sachs's revenues for the first half of 2012. As a percentage of transactions I'm not sure how you'd work this out (is an IPO one transaction? Multiple?) nor what use it would be. For reference, underwriting represents nothing of Blackrock's or Bridgewater Capital's revenues.<p>>""<i>Wall Street as a whole needs to be in the business of creating capital for companies and selling shares to investors who believe they are shareholders.</i>""<p>A healthy primary market cannot exist without a healthy secondary market, i.e. the success of an IPO, and whether it happens in the first place, is strongly related to how investors feel about being able to sell at some point down the road without incurring losses.<p>Let's examine the connection between holding term and governance mentality. The FT recently had a piece documenting that institutional investors, who own roughly 70 percent of U.S. stocks, despite having long-term positions and near total voting control, tend to by default vote with management and not participate in corporate governance [2]. Resolving our public capital markets is more complicated than fuck the facilitators; ape-handedly throwing taxes around before thinking through the consequences, intended and otherwise, isn't smart (though it will evidently get your article views).<p>--<p>High frequency traders, in a race to the bottom, are in the short-term being run into the red by firms that trade time-consuming safety checks for speed. In the end the bad drives out the good and the market de-stabilises. The solution to this is having a series of pre, inter, and post trade checks that have to be run, e.g. monitoring the total dollar volume of trading over a time interval or the total dollar amount lost mark-to-market (yes, there are firms that took these functions out of pre-trade verification to save a few milliseconds). This puts a natural and non-arbitrary speed limit on the markets which accomplishing something meaningful in that time beyond feeling good about having conducted a witch-hunt.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/000119312512344636/d365261d10q.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886982/00011931251234...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e19b6a54-fbf8-11e1-aef9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26tJrjGeO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e19b6a54-fbf8-11e1-aef9-00144...</a>",1348239229

I came here looking for advice as to how to tackle this.<p>Quick background about myself : Graduated University at the age of 25 (BS in Computer Science) at one of the top technical universities in my country (ITBA), worked as an employee for a couple of years during the late stages of my studies and finally in 2009, took the plunge, founded my own company and hired a couple of employees.<p>Fortunately, its been a great ride. I've been working steadly for 4 years on my own, developing for domestic software development companies building SFDC applications for their US/international clients (since I didn't have any abroad contacts on my own). During that time, I worked (through middle-man companies) for Salesforce.com, ModelMetrics, Mars, OpenEnglish, PropellerDevelopment and several non-profit organizations.<p>My current contract is ending by late October, and since my client is letting go of all contractors and hiring its own inhouse team, I'm looking for work.<p>I have over 3 years of SFDC experience alone and over 6 years in development/project management. Asides from SFDC, I am also skilled in Objective-C, Python, Django, jQuery, HTML5, Java, Agile Methodologies (Scrum mainly), and others. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I speak fluent English and I'm very organized in my work.<p>What am I looking for in a client ? Software development company, if possible, providing SFDC development for several clients, looking for remote developers/contractors. I enjoy building new products and starting projects from scratch.<p>Could you give me some advice on how to go about getting my own abroad clients ? I've always been able to land local clients, but never had an US/Europe one. Worked with them all the time, but from a developer/project leader posision. Never had to sell or manage invoices/payments outside the country.<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.",1348238700

All sites have to do is generate a single device asymetric key pair and provide the one part to the client's browser (we'll call this private) and associate the other part (""public"") to whatever account you care about.<p>Now, you still need some other element to authenticate the user when they visit a website from a new device/browser, but this would mean that you don't have long term cookies that serve the same role and are therefore more extractable over the wire (as we've seen in the past) and would negate these type of attacks.<p>Also, the tech exists in browsers today already, many SSL registrars already do it.",1348238216

Let's think it through. You see a stock priced at B, and you decide you want to buy it. Cuban is saying that a high frequency trader will see that you want to buy the stock, and he'll buy it for B and then sell it back to you at B+X, making X in the process (any you pay more for the stock). To do that, he'd have to know that you were about to submit an order. But he only finds out about your order <i>after</i> you've submitted the order to the exchange, and the exchange has relayed it to him. He doesn't get the opportunity to ""jump in front of you"", and I have no idea why Cuban thinks he does.<p>In actuality, what happens is this. The high frequency trader sees that the stock is priced at B if you want to buy it, and S if you want to tell it (with B > S). He then expresses his willingness to sell you the stock at B-X (by sending a limit order to the exchange). When you come along to buy it, you get it at B-X instead of B, which <i>saves you money</i>. The trader gets a rebate from the exchange for supplying liqudity (which he did, since you got the stock for less than you would have otherwise) and hopefully he is able to buy it back for some price around S (with another limit order), thereby making the difference between B-X and S.<p>There are dangers with high frequency trading [1] but they are not of the kind that Cuban is describing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_capital#2012_stock_trading_disruption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_capital#2012_stock_tradi...</a>",1348237997

4553843,comment,4553541,4553541,10,0,marknutter,,,"Steve's point is well made here. I think there are a combination of reasons this happens all too often:<p>1) Most programmers are introverts and are more comfortable interacting with their code than they are with actual people (no disrespect intended)<p>2) It's easy to get excited about an idea and then subconsciously avoid trying to invalidate it through customer feedback. Often times throwing up a simple landing page explaining what your product with a place to sign up or even enter in a credit card can validate or invalidate an idea. Ignorance is bliss, though, and it's easier to pretend your idea will become a success if you just add enough features and polish.<p>3) Too much emphasis is placed on ""launch day"". All too often startups think of the day they release their software as the make-or-break day for their company. Rarely is that ever the case. Most startups become successful long after their initial launch. It's a marathon, not a sprint, and often times the successful version of a product ends up being very different than the launch version.<p>4) Fear of success. If you launch something and people actually start using it, now you're held accountable for whether or not it works; especially if you charge for it. There's a lot of stress that goes along with actually gaining traction and I think a lot of people keep pushing their launch off to avoid that stress under the guise of trying to make the product ""perfect"".<p>The tragedy, of course, is the opportunity cost of sinking so much of your time into a product that nobody actually ever wanted. In the beginning stages your number one priority should be trying to figure out the cheapest, fastest way to validate your idea, whether that be a simple landing page, a barebones prototype, or whatever other clever mechanism you can think of. When you finally do come up with something people actually want and even pay for, <i>then</i> spend every waking moment making it the best product you can.",1348237327

Ofcourse an investor could have made the wrong call, but then the outcome of a stock moving up or down over the long run should be related to the actual performance of the company in the real world, not some alternate universe dominated by hft algos seeking arbitrage opportunities.",1348237223

I've noticed that people I know are posting fewer status updates with every passing year, but they still heavily use Facebook for chat, event invitations, photos and groups. For a lot of people, Facebook seems to be becoming less of a pastime and more of a <i>tool</i> for communicating with friends and family.<p>I dislike Facebook as much as the next hacker, but I don't think Facebook is going anywhere anytime soon. It'll just become less interesting as a communication medium. After all, nobody is excited about the telephone any more.",1348236280

Isn't the vast majority of their profit coming from higher then normal margins on hardware?  Their bread and butter is suppose to be making compelling tech products that have high build quality and are easy to use for any type of user.  Why would Apple care where ad dollars are going as long as they kept doing what they are suppose to be doing to justify their high margin devices?  Apple isn't in the ad business.<p>Of course, with their map move they've just compromised the quality of one of the core services of a mobile device, that should be a bigger deal then any of this nonsense about location based recommendations being the future of ad revenue.",1348236095

If people believe Kickstarter campaigners are naive, that's one thing; they'll proceed with a bit more caution.

Sometimes funny place to visit, impossible to live, hard to do business.\n“Disputants could select among several fora” — the author forgot about one very important “if”. Disputants could select among several fora IF they were from the same social class.\nThe fun starts when they’re from different social classes. In nowadays Russia, a public prosecutor or a police officer can literally kill whomever he wants. Unless the victims were from equal or higher social strata, 99% such cases will be closed, 1% will be presented to a court like “a person assaulted a public prosecutor and was shot dead as a reasonable self-defense act”.<p>The western society isn’t stratified that much, almost no one thinks it’s OK to kill people regardless of how many stars are on the killer’s epaulets.\nHowever, there are still many cases with great asymmetry between two dealing parties.\nLike when you buy electricity for your home.\nDon’t you think your electricity supplier would love to add “no disputes are allowed, I’m the final authority” to your contract, if they could? If you don’t like that contract, they don’t care — you only bring 0.00001% of their income, however they bring you 100% of your electricity, and in many places you don’t even have much choice.",1448420108

10625097,comment,10622615,10625014,0,0,Jach,,,"Looks like he put some links elsewhere in this thread, but I&#x27;m in a very similar situation with the same goal -- 25, saving up, hoping to &quot;retire&quot; in my early-to-mid 30s at the latest -- so here&#x27;s how I look at it. The core idea and assumption is: you can get on average <i>at least</i> 5% annual growth by investing your savings instead of stuffing it in a bank account or under your mattress. As long as you can live on less than that per year, you don&#x27;t have to work.<p>For me I&#x27;d be fine living at $20k/yr. This makes my target goal in savings to be around $500k. So if you have $500k invested this January, by next January you should have $525k. As long as you can live on less than 5%, typically at most 4% ($20k) per year, then next January you withdraw your $20k and your total invested savings is $505k. One year later, that grows by 5% again, to $525,250. Take your $20k (which is now <i>less</i> than 4%), repeat until you die or we hit the Singularity. :)<p>I think you need buffer room to handle the core assumption, though, and this is ignoring taxes and other things. For instance, Vanguard hasn&#x27;t been doing that well for the past 2 years, though it will probably do better and the 10 year average yearly return from 2013 to 2023 will almost certainly be higher than 5%. You can buffer yourself against economic slumps by having more money or living more frugally -- additionally, there&#x27;s the possibility of entering into the real estate business once you have some initial capital, that may also be a (somewhat risky) way of hedging since you may nominally be $1.5m in debt from your mortgaged properties, but as long as rent exceeding mortgage+repairs keeps coming in and the n-plex doesn&#x27;t massively depreciate in value you have a steady stream of income that&#x27;s independent of your savings that you could sell if needed to wipe away your debt.",1448420016

10625050,comment,10619614,10619614,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"Rule of law can be understood first by taking apart the linguistic construction, and then by examining the political conditions under which it emerged. Society is to be ruled by laws, not people. This is not trivial to accomplish. As they say, freedom isn&#x27;t free, and neither is rule of law.<p>I could not take this article seriously because it tries to understand rule of law by actually examining law, rather than by examining law&#x27;s place in society. Rule of law is an appellation given by historians to describe a society, not a specific legal concept.<p>Whatever ideological construct we want to order society by, a part of that society has to be dedicated to actually enforcing that construct. Medieval England had an innovative institution dedicated towards adjudicating disputes that came to be known as common law. Local magistrates collaborated to create a body of judicial decisions and understandings that other magistrates would respect.<p>This freed law from the vagaries of local and national politics. The norm in the rest of the world was that both judges and the law were the sole domain of the monarch. The monarch picked the judges and the laws and that was that. What allowed English crowdsourced jurisprudence to flourish was that it was protected by England&#x27;s other major innovation, Parliament. Parliament held the purse strings of the national budget, and the king had to ask Parliament for money whenever it needed to do things like raise an army. Without Parliament&#x27;s approval, the king was limited to using his own land holdings to finance his affairs. In most of continental Europe, the king was free to tax the citizenry directly using the army to enforce collection.<p>What allowed England to do this was its relative isolation from the rest of Europe, this allowed England enough safety and security to not need a standing, national army. Instead England was free to iterate on this body of law and produce a diverse array of commercial contracts that allowed people to collaborate on business ventures on a scale the world had never seen before.<p>It also allowed England to, eventually, displace the monarchy as the ultimate seat of power in their society, replacing that role with the Prime Minister, who had to rise through the political ranks to his office. Continental Europe needed their monarchs to pursue national defense, as every European nation was at constant risk of invasion. Failure to do so resulted in getting conquered, as Spain was throughout much of the Middle Ages. Civic institutions never achieved the democratic buy-in that they did in England.<p>I have written before that rule of law, as we consider it, is a uniquely Anglo institution, the British exported their legal innovations everywhere they went. Not having to worry too hard at appeasing their kings gave British citizens unprecedented ability to contribute to local government. Government itself was viewed as just another type of legal organization, when establishing a colony, there was a well-trodden map to governance that was established by Parliament and slowly perfected over the course of the colonial period.<p>It is this series of innovations in the role of government in society over the course of history that provide Anglo nations with rule of law. The term was never intended to carry the connotations I often see people ascribe to it. It is not a property of law, but a property of the society using law.

As someone who made some stupid decisions by letting <i>friends</i> (or so I thought) borrow my car and take care of my cats (opened my home while I wasn&#x27;t there) and who got totally fucked over for thousands of dollars, I&#x27;d never ever let anyone rent my car or in my house without me being there. I learned my lesson the hard way and many people are now learning the same hard lesson.<p>The thing is, it doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. Companies like airbnb, flightcar, etc. have more than enough money to easily cover the damages that do occasionally happen. Their failure to act and remedy things basically shows what shitty companies they are. It&#x27;s amazing to me that the biggest percentage of users of such services don&#x27;t get fucked over, but it&#x27;s even more amazing to see companies shirk their duties. In fact, if the company doesn&#x27;t clearly list what they&#x27;d do in case of such foul play and their insurance policy, I don&#x27;t even think they should be allowed to legally operate a business. Of course, this is part of a growing trend of companies trying to get rid of any liability they have and put it on their customers. I&#x27;m hoping that as more horror stories happen, someone will start legislating these companies and demand that they pay for any damages. Until then, I would stay away from such companies as a &quot;host.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s just stupid to do business with such companies, just as stupid as letting your friends borrow your car / stay in your place unsupervised.

But there is an uncomfortable truth hidden behind the exaggeration there. HR people can and do make those kinds of assumptions all the time. They do it when they are looking at resumes; they do it when they are setting up phone screens; they do it when they are setting up PIPs.<p>There&#x27;s a deeply seated problem happening when you allow people with no subject matter experience be the gatekeepers of who does and doesn&#x27;t get into a company. Externally, it manifests as bias or prejudice or racism. No amount of data analysis can get people to shunt a fundamentally flawed assumption though.<p>In my opinion, there&#x27;s only one kind of person who could invent such a daft null hypothesis about what makes a good team: someone who&#x27;s never worked on a team like that. I&#x27;m glad that the People Ops people at Google are making some progress. Perhaps other companies will follow suit, but the problem persists. There will still be the same people in HR making the same boneheaded assumptions about all kinds of things with little direct feedback.<p>I realize that any sizable company needs HR for at least some minimal amount of due diligence in the hiring process, and that HR employees are generally less expensive than Legal Counsel dept. employees. But we should stop giving HR the insane carte blanche it has in many large companies. We should stop letting it create policy. Because the policies created are so often antithetical to the needs of the company, and in some cases, to society.<p>Instead, we should embed HR workers in the teams they are working with. Perhaps every pod at Google doesn&#x27;t need its own HR rep, but there is a level of management that would make sense to have one HR person to handle hiring/recruiting/necessary paperwork. You can argue that the HR person attached to a unit will be biased and perhaps not handle things appropriately when a complaint comes up. But you&#x27;re wrong because in any situation where a complaint happens, HR is just a proxy for Legal. Cut out the middle-people and just have the Legal team handle it directly. HR doesn&#x27;t really add anything to those situations except a level of misdirection(some people think HR is there for them, not the company).<p>As a general trend, these 5 markers of success are probably pretty good. But I challenge you to find something in any of that which is concrete enough to be actionable. I guarantee you the HR people will find some action, and it will be for some manager to do some evaluation on how well some team performs on those metrics.<p>To go full circle here, the final issue I have with a blog like this is that it makes the mistake of finding that what they thought was the general case was &quot;not true.&quot; The goal for a team is not to achieve some success in hazy, ill-defined (and probably some variation of survivor-biased) ideas about how to manage a team.<p>Some teams will absolutely thrive with the goofy composition that was first stated. Others will fail. If you define success or failure as shipping a viable product. If you define success as how well you implemented the latest directives from HR, well, that&#x27;s different.<p>We need to rethink the way we handle HR and what it does. It should not, for example (as done in this blog post) tell managers how to manage their teams. Nor should it tell teams what their identity is or should be.",1448416935

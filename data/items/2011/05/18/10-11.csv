Being used to the Gnome and Windows-style window management, I expected the worst, but it's not too bad, especially the new Launcher and effective use of screen space.  It's kind of clunky right now and isn't easily configured without the CompizConfig Settings Manager, but I think it has serious potential.<p>Not everyone will like it, but it's definitely worth trying out.<p>By the way, you can stop the Launcher from auto-hiding by opening the CompizConfig Settings Manager (not included by default), going to Desktop > Ubuntu Unity Plugin and changing the Hide Launcher box to 'Never'.",1305716248

I like them too, but they are solidly in the middle of the price curve for tools.   I also like kingston ram for my servers;  Much like Craftsman tools, the stuff is good enough to get the job done and has an excellent warranty, but it's far from the best money can buy.<p>I think the top end usually has a huge 'you must be rich' price premium that doesn't usually make sense unless you use this tool all the time.<p>(Of course, we're both falling in to the trap of evaluating a product based on it's price positioning, which, I think, is quite often a mistake.  The evaluation should be based on what you are paying for what you are getting, not based on where in the price curve your particular tool lies, I think.)",1305716242

But my fundamental problem was to understand why circuits were built the way they were.<p>Like the example of the thermic resistor used to measure room temperature. At first I had no idea why the out line to the controller's pin had to be put between 2 resistors (one being the sensor). The tutorial I followed mentioned only that it's called a voltage divider - but that was it. (In hindsight this is really a most basic concept - but at that time it was confusing to me.)<p>I read a few books on that subject since then but playing with <a href=""http://www.falstad.com/circuit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.falstad.com/circuit/</a> ultimately helped me the most.<p>I just wish there were some simple explanations of these concepts.

2559671,comment,2559079,2559338,2,0,mjb,,,"> Not only that, but the behavior of some cases in hardware VMM layers can cause pretty much complete TLB wipes, thus destroying cache coherency and any memory optimizations the web server takes advantage of.<p>It is certainly true that VMs can have an impact on webserver performance, but the biggest effects are on performance under saturation, rather than peak performance. In my experience, the mean latency of serving typical dynamic applications from a VM isn't significantly higher on a VM than on similarly powered native hardware. This picture changes at high percentiles (the latency of the top 0.1% of requests, for example) but is certainly not catastrophic for the vast majority of workloads.<p>Of course, if you are running on a soft-scheduled VM on a busy box, or a very small hard-scheduled slice of hardware, then you are going to get bad performance.<p>But what concrete difference does this have on the price/performance ratio? It's fairly clear from the experiences of several big web companies that the cost of running web servers on a VM is well worth paying in exchange for the lowered costs of maintenance and system management. A good virtualization infrastructure can significantly reduce whole-system TCO for many workloads.<p>As for the testing infrastructure, the ability to spin up and down test clusters on services like Amazon EC2 is a huge win. The sizes of the instances (slices/vms/etc) should be chosen to minimize the effect of the client VM, but you don't have to go far to remove the measurement effect of running on a VM in most cases.",1305714868

2559669,comment,2555349,2559042,4,0,dkersten,,,"Standard Lua may not have integer types, but as far as I know, LuaJIT does actually support integer types under the hood. At the very least, you can force it by declaring an integer using the FFI, eg:<p><pre><code>    local ffi = require(""ffi"")\n    int = ffi.new(""int"")\n    int = 10\n    print(int)\n</code></pre>\nI also don't find the lack of macros in Lua as limiting as I do in other languages. For example, if I wanted to create an EDSL in Lua, I would have it parse a string at startup. For example, imagine a state machine DSL:<p><pre><code>    fsm = my_dsl[[\n        start: foo\n        stop:  quux\n        foo -> bar\n        foo -> baz\n        bar -> foo\n        baz -> quux\n    ]]{ foo = function()\n            code for foo here\n        end,\n        bar = function()\n            code for bar here\n        end,\n        baz = function()\n            code for baz here\n        end,\n        quux = function()\n            code for quux here\n        end\n    }\n    fsm.run()\n</code></pre>\nAs a real-world example, here is some Lua code I'm using in a hobby game project:<p><pre><code>    DEFINE(Traits.Position)[[\n        float x;\n        float y;\n        float z;\n    ]]\n    DEFINE(Traits.Movement)[[\n        float x;\n        float y;\n        float z;\n    ]]\n    DEFINE(Behaviors.do_movement){\n        input={Traits.Position, Traits.Movement},\n        output=Traits.Position,\n        frequency=0.01,\n\t\n        -- Update entities position\n        fn = function (pos, mov)\n            local delta = dark.timedelta\n            new_pos = Traits.Position.new()\n            new_pos.x = pos.x + (mov.x * delta)\n            new_pos.y = pos.y + (mov.y * delta)\n            new_pos.z = pos.z + (mov.z * delta)\n            return new_pos\n        end}\n\n    -- Create a sample entity\n    local entity = Entities.new()\n    entity.add(Traits.Position, {1.0, 0.0, 0.0})\n    entity.add(Traits.Movement, {0.0, -1.0, 0.0})\n\n</code></pre>\n""<i>That said, I'd give a higher priority for the language in my browser to be safe: some kind of correctness guarantee would be nice.

My favorite demo was how they use tablets to replace a robotic head or to hold it in front of the users head as a window into the robots world.<p>To me cloud computing is not just the next big thing but a 100% necessary and logical step towards cheaper and better service robots. Somehow though, lots of robotic researches I speak to [1], not only the senior ones, don't like the idea. What bothers them, is that such a robot is not autonomous anymore.<p>But how autonomous is a machine that needs to recharge its battery every other hour? What is more reasonable assumption? That you can recharge your robot where and whenever you want or that you can have internet access?<p>Good to see, that there is plenty of the best people that work on cloud robotics now. Can't wait to try some stuff out! Only down sight: Does this mean I have to use Java now?<p>[1] Right now, mostly Europeans.",1305713349

2559632,comment,2559177,2559337,2,0,CaptainDecisive,,,"I agree.<p>The way I see it there is a price/value curve where it's worth buying things at both ends.<p>At the high end you're paying a premium but you're getting a well designed and constructed item, which should last you a long time.<p>At the low end you're buying cheap crap but you're paying peanuts. You know there's no high end features, that it's not well made and if it breaks you just throw it out.<p>But in the middle you're paying more than the cheap stuff but you're mostly still getting crap, although here's it's likely to be 'branded' crap. Same thing as the cheap stuff, just more expensive.<p>So buy at both ends of the scale, not in the middle: buy cheap and get what value you can out of it, buy expensive and appreciate its value for a long time.",1305713057

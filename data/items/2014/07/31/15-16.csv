8114846,comment,8111709,8114715,1,0,theseoafs,,,"Sort of.  You can effectively do so in a language like Java, which allows you to inspect the types of objects at runtime.  For example if you have a class `Foo` with two subclasses `SubA` and `SubB` you could do something like this:<p><pre><code>    public static void test(Foo f) {\n        if (f isinstanceof SubA) {\n            SubA a = (SubA)f;\n            /* ... */\n        } else if (f isinstanceof SubB) {\n            SubB b = (SubB)f;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis works okay but you have to implement all the machinery yourself, and for a statically typed language Java is notoriously type-unsafe so if you make a mistake with your casts you&#x27;re basically not going to find out until you get an exception at runtime.  And of course there might be other existing subclasses of `Foo` which means that you get no compile-time guarantee that you didn&#x27;t miss a possible case.<p>Standard ML approaches subtyping in a very different way that renders this kind of approach impossible.  It gives you less freedom in that it eliminates downcasting, but that ultimately results in a safer language.  Of course Standard ML has proper sum types with all of their compile-time guarantees so there&#x27;s little reason for it anyway.",1406822154

Is this thing new? Yes. Will developers take time (=your money) to get up to speed on it? Yes. But do you need &quot;better&quot; developers, long-term? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>> Not only that, but you&#x27;re making the project more complicated. i.e if the project is to create x, then you have to also create y first and, it&#x27;s harder to debug.<p>Maybe a valid concern, but I remember very similar arguments from C++ programmers in the early days of the JVM. Turns out the JVM is rock-solid and nowadays has better debugging tools than those for C++. There&#x27;s no reason that couldn&#x27;t be true for this approach. Or if it&#x27;s easy to make a multi-target project that builds both a linux binary and a unikernel image, then debugging would be no harder than it is for existing OCaml code.<p>> and you&#x27;ve also got the added overhead of running xen.<p>If you&#x27;re already running linux-in-xen then this is reducing overhead. Even if you&#x27;re not, it could still improve overall performance by reducing context switching, in the same way as user-mode networking stacks.<p>> it&#x27;s a nice trick, but it&#x27;s not very practical, because if it was practice we&#x27;d all be using dos for our vms<p>This sounds rather like &quot;this can&#x27;t be a good idea because if it was we&#x27;d have it already&quot;.

The only one you really lose is proximity to things like work and brick-and-mortar stores. Everything else is like the suburbs but way better: near-zero crime, an intimate community (if there are even other people), a sense of autonomy, breathtaking nature, star-filled skies, insanely low cost of living. No need for playgrounds and pools, the kids can go explore in the woods and swim in the nearby pond/creek. Nobody will abduct or harm them because there are no other people for miles. If you want local produce, you can get some from a nearby farmer or just grow it in a giant garden in your front yard. The main downsides are distance from everything, and lack of any kind of culture. You have to make your own culture inside your home.",1406820812

To me, the priority is limiting damage while still allowing law enforcement to function. One of the key privacy advantages of how LE access to phone companies or gmail or similar is implemented that it allows them to be granted access to just the data in question and little more.<p>What really becomes a problem is when the evidence in question is only available from one source and there&#x27;s no way to do it that doesn&#x27;t run the risk of what I&#x27;m going to term information bycatch. At that point there are really only two viable options - allow the collection with bycatch or disallow the collection due to bycatch.<p>The first is a significant privacy risk. That said, it&#x27;s also not a new one. As long as people have kept records or written letters, a search has run the risk of exposing the private information of other unrelated people. Certainly, the same concern applies to tapping phone calls, and that&#x27;s permitted by courts.<p>The second runs the risk of hobbling law enforcement entirely. Without perfect knowledge of what a given document, packet, phone call, etc. might contain, it&#x27;s impossible to say that a search will or will not invade the privacy of another person in addition to the subject.<p>My understanding is that a warrant is for information or items because it&#x27;s known and understood that information bycatch isn&#x27;t always avoidable. This is considered unfortunate but unavoidable, as there cannot always be assumed to be other and better options.<p>I think this goes back to my earlier point about design.

At the simplest level, there is no such thing as a bus which doesn&#x27;t exchange data... even my keyboard and mouse are just sending data. At multiple levels there is software (therefore the potential for security bugs) in this process. My keyboard has software to convert a set of input pin readings into a form to put on the bus. It has a bus communications chip that has software (firmware whatever) to talk to a host. The other side has a similar set of software to send data from the bus to memory or to input pins on a chip. The chip runs software to interpret these signals into usefulness. There are lots of places for problems in there.<p>Further, USB was designed from the beginning to allow block devices to transfer data. I don&#x27;t quite get why this means it wasn&#x27;t designed for data sharing - moving around physical, removable disks was the standard for data sharing for a long time when usb came out - back then most people couldn&#x27;t reliable send big stuff over the network. The plan was definitely for sharing data.<p>Basically the security issues come from the shape of the problem rather than a specific implementation of it. For example there&#x27;s always someone doing &quot;fun&quot; things with network cards - another example of a device with DMA access and a microprocessor. If you can root the network card, you can get access to other parts of the device.<p>So yeah - usb seems to be particularly easy to break, but it part of a generally hard problem.

8114525,comment,8111406,8111406,1,0,logfromblammo,,,"Public transit is good.  Definitely include it in your city.<p>But what you really need to kill automobile dependence is a way to transport goods throughout your city without a human to shepherd it along.  You need to have train cars that can automatically load and unload palletized goods, and a package routing network for smaller items.  Your pizza delivery will consist of the restaurant putting your food into a standardized container and pushing the &quot;send&quot; button.  When you shop, you send your purchases directly home from the store instead of carrying them with you for the rest of the evening.<p>Cars aren&#x27;t just for getting to distant places fast.  They are also for moving stuff around too heavy for you to carry around everywhere you go.  I once bought an air conditioner window unit in downtown Chicago and took it home on the El.  That was such a hassle that I became much less reticent about giving up my parking spot afterward.  It wasn&#x27;t long after that when I stopped walking the six blocks to Jewel to buy as much food as I could carry home in my arms and started driving across the state border to buy as much as I could store in my home without spoilage.<p>City simulators that track the movement of people are fine, but they are incomplete if you can&#x27;t also track the non-people items that also move around and transform within residences and businesses.  Food, water, power, clothing, necessities, luxuries, raw materials, sewage, and trash all move around semi-independently, and in most cities, a lot of that moves around in a human-piloted vehicle.<p>Power moves through conductive cables.  Drinking water does through pipes.  Data goes through glass fibers or conductive wires.  Fuel gas moves through pipes.  Sewage moves through pipes.  But then we have garbage trucks, delivery trucks, and cars moving everything else.  Where are the pipes for that stuff?<p>Intermodal containerized shipping changed the world.  But you can&#x27;t exactly manage your household deliveries with a metal box 20m long.  But thanks to them, most everything that makes it to your house once fit on a pallet or inside a shopping cart.  Construct a container standard around those sizes and make your transportation infrastructure handle the containers, and your city no longer needs postal workers, delivery drivers, solid waste collectors, or anyone else whose entire job is to take things and move them to other places.<p>But something like that is going to be more expensive, and it has to be 99.99999% reliable.  You&#x27;ll need to be a lot more dense than suburban housing to afford that, especially when you have to invent and bootstrap all the tech yourself.<p>Edit: I bet you could probably get bootstrap funding from the logistics command of a national army and trial the system on a military base.  What you would likely end up with is a rugged plastic cube-shaped crate with 4-way entry for forklifts and handtrucks, and attachment points for parachutes, chains, ropes, or tie-down straps.  That would be your large container.  Your small container would probably be a little less than 1/8 the size.",1406819317

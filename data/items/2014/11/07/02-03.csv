8571009,comment,8567020,8567020,0,0,contingencies,,,"I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time looking at this area in a cross-platform way (ie. distribution-neutral, even OS-neutral, even &#x27;service code execution environment might be a language VM instead of an OS&#x27; type ways / smacks of erlang, clojure or embedded development). Ubuntu contributions may be interesting but there&#x27;s a few things in this statement that stuck out to me:<p>(1) Serge Hallyn moved to Ubuntu a fair while back. He was one of the two original LXC developers. We were in touch about 2009/2010, before he moved. The kernel features were IIRC originally funded by IBM with a view towards more efficient allocation of resources on their mega-scale platforms, but apparently failed to get adequate traction against the rest of industry which is parallelizing on commodity hardware.<p>(2) CRIU&#x27;s DOOM demo is a loaded one. Moving containers around is very cute, and has definite appeal to less technical management who perceive it as adding flexibility, however the real tradeoff here is random weirdness across your application or service&#x27;s execution (from probably-OK latency spikes to probably-not network stream accounting interruptions on third-party devices and associated layer 2 and 3 security hiccups) for assumed portability. These days, that&#x27;s a crutch, albeit a useful one - particularly for very specific cases such legacy applications you can&#x27;t rewrite requiring very high uptime - but not something to use if you can avoid it. Removing the monolithic assumptions in your service and incorporating node-failure and a distributed execution model is generally a <i>much</i> better idea... cheaper hardware, lower blood pressure, lower TCO, higher uptime.<p>(3) <i>Our primary design goal with LXD, is to extend containers into process based systems that behave like virtual machines.</i> What does that actually mean? For one, workflow considerations are not at the fore. It also means hybrid paravirt/container or hybrid third-party-cloud/local infrastructures are still going to need another management layer to abstract the various portions of infrastructure in to a common interface (as will services relying in whole or in part on non-Linux OSs or execution environments). These are a big part of the infrastructure and process challenge in many/most modern environments. As far as the &#x27;extending&#x27; part goes, mostly LXC already offers everything, though the plethora of paradigms available for security, storage, resource allocation and QoS represent a relatively imposing research and execution challenge to even the most hardened Linux users: there&#x27;s some ease of use work to be done, but how to achieve the same without sacrificing flexibility?<p>(4) <i>our customers are, in fact, asking us for complete operating systems that boot and function within a Linux Container&#x27;s execution space, natively [...] Ubuntu boots</i> unmodified <i>in Linux Containers today</i>. That&#x27;s the very easiest thing to achieve and has in fact been considered the &#x27;lazy way&#x27; of using containers rather than writing custom applications with carefully crafted chroots and minimalistic dynamically-linked library dependency trees, refining custom kernel security toolkit policies for your application to back up carefully considered capability restrictions for the container, network namespaces with additional restrictions, custom cgroup-based multi-subsystem resource caps, etc. The fact that some distros assume they in full control of the hardware during their init process is largely resolved these days ... and I&#x27;d wager with very little to no thanks to LXD, except perhaps internal lobbying within Ubuntu.<p>(5) &quot;Cloud Solutions Product Manager&quot; version: <i>LXD is a whole new semantic</i> ... meaningless. Coder version from <a href=""https://github.com/lxc/lxd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lxc/lxd</a> : &quot;a REST API, command line tool and OpenStack plugin based on liblxc&quot;. &#x27;Nuff said.",1415328675
8571008,comment,8567721,8570628,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"True, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they will. One of the smarter things about Silk Road in my view was the nominal policy of disallowing trade in child pornography, criminal services, stolen credit card data and so on, ie illicit things that also have (or are intended to have) victims who are necessarily injured as a condition of production. There&#x27;s no economic tipping point at which the consumption of child pornography could justify the abuse perpetuated in its production, for example.<p>While the drug trade can cause people to become victims (just as the legal trade in alcohol or cigarettes or many other commodities), such victimhood is incidental to the production and consumption of the illicit good rather than inherent to it. I think this distinction between what sorts of contraband could be traded on Silk Road (even if it was not adhered to in practice) is a big part of why many people were/are sympathetic towards Silk Road.",1415328673

8571006,comment,8570790,8570790,0,0,javajosh,,,"Last year I worked for a startup and I allowed myself to be pushed past the breaking point. The founders tempted me with equity (which never actually materialized) and I ended up doing many all nighters and many 90-hour weeks prior to an early release (another company was doing the front-end while we did the server in-house).<p>I don&#x27;t have a wife or a puppy, but I shouldn&#x27;t have allowed this to happen. I was hired to work for a set salary under the assumption of a 40-hour work-week - although I am naturally obsessive so I knew that wouldn&#x27;t actually last. But I didn&#x27;t expect my boss to say things like, &quot;If we don&#x27;t have a working build by 3pm tomorrow, we&#x27;re all fired,&quot; (which turned out to be false, actually).<p>Pacing is important, and I think it would be interesting to do a startup where pacing is actively encouraged. I think this might be possible at a startup with strong IP protection, good funding, and leadership that sets realistic goals and trusts it&#x27;s people to be motivated to get it done. It may mean that the public has to wait a bit longer before having a cool new thing available to them, but it also means that the thing will have been constructed by fresh, happy minds.<p>There is a moral imperative to not buy goods made in sweatshops. There is also a moral imperative to not use software produced under inhumane conditions.

I have a PhD in physics and have some administrative experience, and I didn&#x27;t (yet) have a postdoc position.<p>The application process was very interesting---I had a phone conference-call interview with a few people in Wisconsin and New Zealand.  I made what must have been a relatively short short list, because the interview was not cheap: they flew me to WIPAC, had me take a full physical (ultrasound, cardio study, chest x-rays, etc.) which is required for any winter-over position, set up a full day of interviews with science-side, tech-side, and administrative-side people, some of whom themselves had wintered over.  The beer and cheese curds in Madison are great.  Check out the Great Dane.<p>A lot of the interview was to gauge personality, and there were a lot of questions along the lines of &quot;If someone was acting in a dangerous & threatening way, and you were in a place more remote than the space station (in the sense that there is no escape capsule or any chance for rescue) what would you do?&quot;<p>The tech that keeps IceCube going is a bunch of custom-designed and manufactured blades which receive (IIRC) UDP from the sensors in the ice.  A lot of processing happens at the pole, because the limited (and satellite-orbit-dependent) bandwidth would make transferring the whole dataset wildly impractical.  So the &quot;interesting&quot; events are found on-site and sent over the satellite, while everything is also written to tape.  Once the summer comes the tape is swapped out.  Scientists can also query additional data to be sent via satellite if they need something specific.<p>A few weeks later I was told that for the two IceCube winter-over tech positions, I was third choice, and that if one of the people offered the job sustains an injury, fails the psychological examination, or backs out, that I might be called on short notice.  As I didn&#x27;t have a job at that point, it was OK by me, but I was certainly disappointed.

PGP&#x27;s RSA constructions are archaic; they use a format defined in the 1990s that is vulnerable to multiple different attacks and likely to harbor more that we don&#x27;t know about yet. (This, bafflingly, is also a problem with DNSSEC.) I should be clear: PGP is not itself known to be vulnerable to these attacks. But neither was Java&#x27;s TLS implementation, before it was found to be vulnerable a few months back.<p>2. RSA is well-studied but it&#x27;s hard to say how well we understand its strength. There are no credible attacks on RSA-2048, but academic progress is being made on a cousin of the factoring problem it relies on (the discrete log problem). ECC is based on a harder math problem, is also well studied, and is believed to be stronger.<p>3. ECC is faster and provides more security with fewer key bits.<p>A combination of all three of these factors gives a sort of second-order issue, which is that modern public key crypto constructions tend to be based on ECC and not multiplicative group IFP/DLP algorithms. EdDSA is good for reasons other than that it&#x27;s based on good ECC crypto.<p>Hope that&#x27;s helpful and not just noise. Looking forward to inevitable &#x27;pbsd correction. :)",1415327262

Simple options that used to exist have disappeared and new options of questionable utility have taken their place.<p>Probably my favorite thing about the Kindle is that it syncs my place with my phone, but the app on iOS is gotten much worse over the years. At this point when reading a book the timeline thing at the bottom and all sorts of weird little blue dots on it that I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out.

And when they brought them back or not real buttons, but hopefully they&#x27;re good enough.<p>In the meantime the books are still absolutely riddled with typos, terrible formatting, and if a publisher actually makes an update to a book you&#x27;re unlikely to find out about it. What little I&#x27;ve heard of the authorship side of things is supposed be pretty dreadful too, were even recent kindles don&#x27;t support some of the newest formatting things because Amazon hasn&#x27;t bothered to update them.<p>It&#x27;s the best e-book reader on the market, and in many ways it&#x27;s a piece of crap.

8570903,comment,8568465,8570423,0,0,codezero,,,"Yeah, I still think that it takes resources and I&#x27;m interested in that complete economy.<p>As for hunting, in the UK as early as 1200AD, peasants couldn&#x27;t hunt on much of the land, the largest game they could hunt was probably not enough to provide much in the way of skins. Of course, the UK isn&#x27;t the whole world, so this doesn&#x27;t apply universally, but it&#x27;s still an issue that plays into it I think. It&#x27;s also really hard to bring down animals like deer, even if you have a bow and arrow. see: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_hunting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_hunting</a><p>This is the kind of stuff that fascinates me though, that loom looks simple, but could you just go out in the woods and get all the components with your every day, 1000 year ago equipment? Maybe, but still, that takes some time, resources and knowledge. Then once you have the darn thing, how do you even make clothes! I guess you just make a big square and cut holes in it? Either way, all of this really fascinates me.",1415325752

No one remembers phone numbers or tries to navigate without GPS, and increasingly we depend on accesss to information so there&#x27;s less practice with storage and recall.<p>What brain/neuron plasticity tells us is that our brains literally reallocate unused neurons for other tasks. So, on the one hand, a positive theory might have it that offloading more mundane tasks would free our brains for higher order thinking and creativity, etc.<p>But, it seems that we are instead finding more ways to distract ourselves with less meaningful &quot;leisure&quot; activity.<p>I don&#x27;t know that we will literally start getting dumber, but it&#x27;s hard to know whether we are headed in a good direction as the future gets closer to the now.",1415325733

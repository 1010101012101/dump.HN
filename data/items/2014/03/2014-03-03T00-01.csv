Even so, I believe college offers a huge opportunity for social and economic mobility.<p>>  In the bottom half of the economic distribution, it’s less than one out of five for those in the third bracket and fewer than one out of 10 in the poorest.<p>So what I am seeing here is that college does offer opportunities at mobility. Compared to the almost 0 opportunity so many would have had otherwise.<p>Let us remember here that we are talking about fifths and tenths of <i>hundreds of millions of people</i>. Ok discount that to only college aged, and we still have tens of millions of people we are talking about.<p>> Nearly three-quarters of American college students attend public universities and colleges, historically the nation’s primary channels to educational opportunity. These institutions still offer the best bargain around, yet even there, tuition increases have bred inequality.<p>Ah now, here is a real problem! The cost of in-state tuition has sky rocketed. Let&#x27;s do something about that, rather than say &quot;college is useless&quot;.<p>As for private educational institutions, the problem seems to be that they have better advertising. They sell a slick message.

7331448,comment,7330683,7330994,5,0,sshumaker,,,"No offense to the parent, but I think AutoLayout is kind of flawed. It&#x27;s a good idea in theory, but has some very rough edges in practice. When things go wrong, it&#x27;s difficult to figure out why, because all the constraint solving happens elsewhere. You might have an over or under constrained layout and end up with problems. In our experience, it also extracts a decent performance hit for complicated layouts (tossing hundreds of rules into a constraint solver is not fast).<p>Some things were harder than they needed to be, as well (e.g. centering a group of vertically layed-out elements). We often needed to create spacer UI elements to work around it.<p>FWIW, I rebuilt an iOS5-compatible version of AutoLayout (using Cassowary for solving and a lot of objective-c runtime magic to maintain a shadow hierarchy that consists of layout objects), which we even shipped for a while. Eventually we decided to move away and write our own system, with an emphasis on debuggability and simplicity. We ended up with a system that kept 90% of the benefits of AutoLayout but without needing to solve constraints.<p>The key element was the idea of &#x27;smart rectangles&#x27; which were used for layout. You can set any two components explicitly of an axis (e.g. left and right) and the others (e.g width and centerX) would be determined automatically. Basically each rect system remembers the last two components on a given axis.<p>We also have the concept of a selection, which takes a group of &#x27;rectangles&#x27; and can perform various operations as a group, like laying them out vertically, centering them all on an axis, and moving them as a group. This makes it easy to do things like center a group of vertically layed out elements (select, layout vertical, then set the selection&#x27;s centerY).<p>The rectangles can then be applied to UI elements (which automatically handles rounding to pixel integrals, and ensures you don&#x27;t end up updating UI unnecessarily as you build your layout, which is the problem with most of the UIView categories). But you don&#x27;t necessarily need a UIView to apply - we&#x27;ve used this system for laying out OpenGL elements as well.<p>In practice, the code feels kinda like Autolayout:<p><pre><code>  buttonRect.centerX = bounds.centerX;\n  buttonRect.width = 100;\n  buttonRect.top = widgetRect.bottom;\n  buttonRect.bottom = bounds.bottom;\n</code></pre>\nUnlike AutoLayout, you need to lay out stuff in order (e.g. you in the example above, widgetRect.bottom has to be set already before you assign across to buttonRect.top), but that was a small price to pay since you can step through the debugger and instantly see any changes you&#x27;re making if your layout doesn&#x27;t work out. And we don&#x27;t handle constraining between non-sibling views as nicely as AutoLayout. But for simplicity, performance, and maintainability, it&#x27;s been a huge win for us.<p>Hopefully we can eventually open source it - all of the devs who&#x27;ve used it miss it when working on personal projects.",1393807672

They deny collaborating with NSA.<p>To that, add that there&#x27;s no evidence anywhere of any such collusion, and that Intel retained Cryptography Research to assess their CSPRNG design.<p>By pluralizing the word &quot;question&quot;, the article injects further misinformation. There&#x27;s <i>one</i> question people are asking about Intel: &quot;why should we trust the RDRAND instruction?&quot;. The question is asked not because there&#x27;s any evidence that RDRAND is compromised, but because CSPRNGs are a uniquely powerful point in a cryptosystem to insert a backdoor. Backdooring the AES instructions is harder; AES is deterministic, so there&#x27;s not much you can do with an &quot;evil&quot; AES. Not so with an RNG.<p>But RDRAND is a stupid backdoor. On every mainstream OS, including the two mainstream mobile OSs, RDRAND is (at best) one of several sources of entropy. In the Linux kernel CSPRNG, in FreeBSD&#x27;s Yarrow, and in WinAPI&#x27;s CryptGenRandom, controlling one entropy input (or even all but one of them) doesn&#x27;t make the CSPRNG&#x27;s output predictable. So even if it is backdoored --- which would be silly --- that backdoor probably doesn&#x27;t impact you in any meaningful way.<p>Cryptographers are wary of RDRAND. It&#x27;s a closed, proprietary design. Cryptographers would rather you use urandom to get your randomness, and if the OS wants to use RDRAND as one of its entropy sources, whatever. Cryptographers would say this whether it was Intel&#x27;s hardware RNG, Apple&#x27;s, Samsung&#x27;s, or Broadcom&#x27;s.",1393807012

They are barely consitent across modes, only if you are lucky. They are the way they are because they are old. And old people don&#x27;t like change. Emacs has also several other problems. It lacks multi threading, the cursor can not be moved off screen. Autocomplete for C-like languages is a mess and really inferior to everything else I used. Compared to all other Lisp dialects, Elisp is the worst. It is not only by far the slowest, it also lacks essential features like namespaces. And then there is complete clusterfuck of conflicting &quot;modes&quot; and the lack of disposition to cooperate and unify within the community.<p>The reason why I&#x27;m so upset is, if you are a newcomer and look at Emacs what you see at first glance on the outside is basically total crap. But then people tell you that the learning curve is high and everything is awesome if you just learn.<p>Well my experience was, the more I learned the more crap appeared. One layer of crap after the other. Luckily everything could somehow be fixed with a lot of configuration and scripts. But the points I mention above are the lowest layer which can not be fixed with just a bunch of lines of Lisp like in the previous layers. So even at the core Emacs is crap.",1393806342

Dissemination of information is also a political issue, but I don&#x27;t recall governments, at least in the West, fighting the internet as such. What you call &quot;bottling up&quot;, others might call &quot;protecting the innocent&quot;. There is no <i>economic</i> need for regulation-free currencies, unless you claim that regulation hinders the economy, which, again, is a political stance because the definition of what the economy is and what&#x27;s good for it is subject to personal values.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine that some cryptocurrency becomes so prevalent that it replaces the national currency. The government just lost a very powerful tool in directing the economy towards desirable political goals. Suppose the citizens of a country decide that they&#x27;d rather have more equality than a higher average standard of living. That&#x27;s a very reasonable wish, I think. With a government-controlled currency, the government might decide to devalue the currency to reduce imports. With an unregulated currency, the government loses one of the most powerful tools of achieving its goals.<p>In the US, government is treated with levels of suspicion uncommon in the rest of the Western world. That&#x27;s not necessarily bad, but it is a peculiarly American trait. In many countries, reducing the power of government can be seen as reducing the power of the population to make collective decisions for the benefit of the people. It puts the fate of the economy in the hands of an indifferent &quot;market&quot;. I&#x27;m just trying to show that just as you see a need for cryptocurrencies, someone else could claim that there is a very strong need for cryptocurrencies to disappear, or, at least, become regulated.<p>Of course, there might well be a strong <i>desire</i> for regulation-free currencies, just as there&#x27;s a strong desire for drugs and prostitution.

The for-profit ones typically teach vocational programs. Some of these are reasonably well respected, but as a result of not being able to offer degrees, they tend to compete more on the skills gained than on the certificate. For example they will want to be able to argue that if you spend time/money there, by the time you&#x27;re done you&#x27;ll be a skilled 3d animator with a portfolio to prove it. So these are relatively unregulated besides not being able to issue degrees (they can issue private certificates). They also don&#x27;t receive state support, and students don&#x27;t receive state financial aid.<p>There are a few weird in-between things. For example the National Film School is very well respected and mostly publicly funded, but doesn&#x27;t issue degrees, because historically it grew out of the film production scene and doesn&#x27;t see itself as &quot;academic&quot; (nowadays they could probably gain degree-granting rights, but it&#x27;s become a point of principle that they&#x27;re a &quot;film school&quot;, not a &quot;university&quot;).",1393805974

For everyone to have equal opportunities, everyone would have to <i>be</i> equal, or in other words, everyone would have to be the same.  Even if that were possible, it wouldn&#x27;t be worth losing our diversity.  (And as I mentioned above, while giving everyone equal opportunities despite their differences might be more fair to them, it could be less fair to others involved, like the startup investor.)<p>My point was that we need to recognize these situations where our ideals conflict, so that we can decide what balance we prefer.  It seems like by accepting &#x27;discrimination&#x27; based on intelligence or athletic ability, we are recognizing that the value of having the most skilled people doing certain jobs outweighs the unfairness to the less skilled applicants, who may work just as hard, but have no control over their innate characteristics.  On the other hand, while it may be true that a person with a family has less time or energy to devote to work than a single person, or a male with a baby has more time than a female with a baby, we have decided that gender equality and the right to have a family outweigh the unfairness to the investor who would ideally take all information into account when choosing an investment.  I think that&#x27;s totally reasonable, but it is helpful to recognize that that is what we&#x27;re doing, rather than simply making statements like &quot;sexism is wrong&quot;, without thinking about it any further.

I hear a complaint about the stock price, which is driven by continuous (and possibly unhealthy for the company) growth, which drives the stock price due to the Greater Fool Theory as much anything else.<p>Such an opinion isn&#x27;t even a commentary on the company- it&#x27;s a commentary on a number (the stock price) that is most likely to go up when companies do risky and dangerous things (blow a ton of money trying to enter new markets or create new markets), and is completely disconnected from the fundamentals of the company, its profits, projections of its future profits, customer happiness and loyalty, and any number of other things that really ought to come in front of &quot;short term explosive growth potential&quot; when attempting to answer questions like, &quot;is company X performing well?&quot; or &quot;is the CEO of company X doing a good job?&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that when that number (again, the stock price) goes down due to a lack of growth in new product categories (Microsoft being the prime example here), it can force such a company to do things that are actively bad for it, because it is compelled to expend tons of resources floundering around trying to reinvent itself when no such complete reinvention is really necessary.<p>Just look at two companies that the stock market has been very kind to over the last 10 years: Amazon and Apple. Did Apple&#x27;s stock go up because of its profit margins? Maybe somewhat, but I&#x27;m guessing that the market was really just responding to growth. Obviously Amazon&#x27;s stock hasn&#x27;t benefited from fat margins; growth is the only thing it has going for it, and it&#x27;s done quite well.<p>In the Amazon case, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s even any concept anymore that someday it will slow down the growth and start fattening its margins. People used to say this like 10 years ago to explain the disconnect between Amazon&#x27;s stock price and their margins, but I think at this point no one&#x27;s even making vague allusions to that theory anymore. People buy Amazon stock because they think other people will buy Amazon stock based solely on growth. Someone might buy Amazon stock thinking that the whole growth thing is a scam, but they don&#x27;t care because the stock price isn&#x27;t based on Amazon&#x27;s performance- it&#x27;s based on how the buyer thinks other people will perceive Amazon&#x27;s performance, scam or no. This is the Greater Fool Theory in a nutshell.",1393805133

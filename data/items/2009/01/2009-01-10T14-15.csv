I haven't noticed that it takes a lot of effort, but I tend to press buttons much harder than necessary anyway, since my proprioception is poor.  By the same token, I'm fairly abusive of hardware, and I was really worried that the G1 would come apart quickly, but it's held up very well, aside from the occasional ominous creaking sound.<p>One thing I really like about the G1 keyboard is that there's a definite ""break"" when the key is pressed, so if I'm paying attention, I can tell when the key goes down.  The physical feedback helps a lot for me.",1231599091

427952,comment,427780,427780,0,0,glymor,,,"A compiled computer program is certainly a rigorous description of something, God knows what, certainly not the programmer.<p>This is just funny:<p><i>""I think computer science has a tremendous amount to offer the fields of logic and mathematics. Specifically, I think that requiring all formulas to be executable by a finite, deterministic system (a computer program) could lead to a great increase in the level of rigor of these fields, would make it easier for students to learn existing results, would make it easier for practitioners to develop new results, and might possibly suggest whole new approaches...</i>*<p>Also he keeps refering to computers as finite. I can only assume he means in a physical sense that there are a non-infinite amount of atoms making up his CPU.<p>I suppose I should critic his argument seriously but it's just too far away from any actual reality.",1231598577
427951,comment,427921,427921,0,0,jerf,,,"Am I the only one thriving in this environment or something?<p>Some nights I play Bioshock. Some nights I work on my (hopefully innovative) Haskell project. Some nights I watch a movie and some nights I write for my blog. Sometimes at work I listen to music and sometimes I just buckle down and code. I've been fighting with distraction lately, but with some success.<p>I like my life much better now than 20 years ago, when I was in (very easy) school, had tons of free time, and hardly anything to do with it but read books and play video games because even my local library had hardly any resources that would teach me how to do anything. (Oh, if only I had found a primer on writing assembler for my computer...)<p>I will say, though, that getting off the marketing treadmill is very important. I just canceled my cable in favor of an electronic video approach with a special emphasis on not getting advertised at anymore (in particular I just had a son, and I want him to grow up in an environment <i>not</i> shared with whatever multi-billion dollar company buys its way into my house), and while I don't run adblock in my browser, NoScript comes close enough for practical purposes. I now pay only minimal attention to things like gaming news, because it's way better to find out something cool came out a year ago ($15) then to anxiously await something coming out in six months ($60). The only reason I pay any attention at all is my taste for games that are only on the shelves for a week (thanks, Atlus).<p>But with that proviso, what we have here is an abundance of <i>wealth</i>, and I for one prefer the problems of wealth to the problems of poverty. If you have a problem, <i>deal with it</i>. No, seriously, deal with it, whatever it takes. Because it's not likely to get much better, barring total social collapse. Even the recession/depression at most will <i>slow down</i> the production of <i>new</i> distractions.",1231598417

427935,comment,427351,427391,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"The quality of peer review varies with the journal. For instance, Journal of Computational Physics tends to give out helpful reviews. From JCP, I usually get back a list of helpful suggestions and weak spots in the paper. Even the incorrect suggestions/criticisms tend to reveal ambiguity in my writing more than anything else.<p>PRL, not so much. In my experience, at least one referee doesn't even finish reading the paper.

427932,comment,427740,427814,0,0,andyking,,,"I replaced my ancient mobile with the latest LG Cookie last week. It's just a £100 pay as you go model, not really a smartphone, but it has a touch-screen and turning it on its side when writing a message reveals an on-screen QWERTY keypad. But it's almost unusable. I don't have fat fingers and I do about 90wpm on a PC keyboard, but these on-screen keypads are terrible for hitting the wrong letter. It's actually quicker to drop to T9 texting mode on the number buttons. Perhaps the iPhone's better, I've never seen one ""in the flesh"", but I can't imagine how they'd make a touchscreen QWERTY keypad work.<p>I had a play with the G1 in the phone shop just out of interest (the disappointment on the shop assistant's face when I said I didn't really want a £35 contract but just wanted the pay as you go phone was quite shocking). It was most impressive and the keyboard was very quick to type on. Hopefully, since I'm under the impression that Android is freely available for manufacturers to use on their phones, we'll start to see some budget manufacturers (Huawei?) using Google's OS at some point in the next couple of years to give users a decent experience without spending loads of money on putting together a proprietary OS.",1231596103
427931,comment,427351,427351,0,0,aposteriori,,,"Some people say double-blind reviews make things better since reviewers aren't (theoretically) influenced by the identity of the authors, and authors can't tailor their paper to suit the reviewers (or try to get back at them later for negative reviews).<p>How about completely open reviewing, like in some of the BiomedCentral medical journals (e.g., <a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed</a>)?<p>If done properly, all the cards are on the table.

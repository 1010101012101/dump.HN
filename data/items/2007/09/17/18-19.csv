I'm saying that if you store real people's passwords in a publically accessible web application using a single-iteration SHA1 hash scheme, you're insecure, and should be embarassed that you were outdone by password schemes that came with your operating system and were largely refined during the 1970s.<p>I ask, what type of attack do you think lengthening the nonce deters? The attacker who is going to construct 4 billion rainbow tables?\n",1190054573

That isn't hyper-focusing; it's polite conversation.  The impolite alternative would be to say you should be embarrassed for making a statement like that.",1190053486

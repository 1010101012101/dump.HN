If you&#x27;re in the need of scaling things up you still have to figure out how AWS works. Who would you rather offend by downtime: 10 users while you&#x27;re starting out, or 10,000 paying users a little down the road?<p>I highly recommend getting started with AWS now. They have a free tier (1 year) which you can use. Heck, you could play around with it, just using it for the company blog.<p>AWS is great in terms of autoscaling. True, the I/O isn&#x27;t great, at least for the free tier (all the more reason to start now, while server load isn&#x27;t that big yet). I wrote a blog post on starting out with AWS last year, check it out if you like.",1394006350

They are just one step ahead of the curve in they don&#x27;t want a shared solution because they want to control their own data. I don&#x27;t trust my blog on tumbler or similar, they may take it down.<p>Requirements:\n* portable, leaning me to think php is the easiest and most host friendly for free/cheap\n* easy install\n* no database for served files, fine for interim writing and working, SQLite for ease I would guess\n* markdown\n* template to make it look nice\n* basic ability to add analytics, SEO, etc\n* dashboard, stats. \n* ability to take to pretty much any host\n* handle a few hundred thousand uniques a day and don&#x27;t have to worry, so HN/reddit can hit it without trouble. Do this on Apache without a CDN etc.\n* maybe even work on S3 or a free Amazon instance. Good learning experience to get others to learn the AWS system controls.<p>Ghost was suggested here the other day. I looked at it and saw it was all node and JS. I knew I was I for a server side config night of fun.<p>Another was posted yesterday and was semi-bashed because it was php.<p>So what do you suggest?<p>I know there&#x27;s lists and lists, but installing and testing to have them fall on your face is no fun. Some have zero pull requests/downloads.<p>Looking for a &quot;I stand by experience&quot; recommendation. And to be honest, I think done right, php is an excellent language for this.

The on thing that I would like to emphasize though is that the book isn&#x27;t advocating just dropping out of highschool, it is talking about replacing the school system&#x27;s stifling attempts at education with teaching yourself what you want to learn. Make no mistake, you won&#x27;t be getting out of work by dropping out, but you will be actually spending your time and effort on learning something important and helpful instead of wasting it on recieving a &#x27;standardized&#x27; education that only exists to make sure that all the grunts have at least a base level of knowledge about &#x27;stuff&#x27;.

Cronyism isn&#x27;t something talked about in back allay&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a legitimate way to get a job/win a contract. No one looks twice at that. All comcast has to do to keep Google out is tell Rahm that he shouldn&#x27;t let it happen and BOOM - no google in Chicago.<p>It becomes especially obvious in the winter when you see only certain parts of the city getting cleared immediately after a snow storm, those parts are where the alderman of that neighborhood lives, or a friend of the mayor lives on that block (and they&#x27;ll do that, just plow a single block). Th rest of the city is plowed as well but it takes a couple days as the plows first have to do their crazy routes to make sure that major donors are all taken care of. I didn&#x27;t really notice this until our alderman changed (I guess I used to live fairly close to the old one). The new alderman lives nearly a mile away from me and thus my block is one of the last in the city to get cleared where as in previous years, it was done directly following major streets. (the streets nearest to her are all plowed and clear immediately, and they&#x27;re of the same significance that my street is, so it&#x27;s not like balance was suddenly restored, they just moved the favor elsewhere).<p>It&#x27;s really the only reason I&#x27;m a republican: this city is all blue and completely corrupt, I don&#x27;t at all understand how people look at Obama, or Durbin, or Pelosi and don&#x27;t see someone who has no morals and is in it for I don&#x27;t even know what (as Obama seems to not even care about the power his position offers).",1394005960

That might save everyone a lot of bandwidth.<p>Of course, people shouldn&#x27;t really be installing their gems from ruby gems on servers anyway, is there any way to prod bundler to make it default to package gems and do a local install where possible, rather than downloading them every time there is a deploy (the current default)? At present you use double bandwidth from people downloading once on their local machine, and once on their server to update.<p>Fetching the ruby gems index with bundler/rubygems still takes a while every time I bundle update, have you looked at optimising that part of the process further (at least it doesn&#x27;t fetch a list of all gems now, but it still fetches a list of all versions of each gem doesn&#x27;t it?), say caching older gem results?

Consequently,  consecutive sentencing is the exception, not the rule, and is almost exclusively reserved for the most heinous crimes, i.e., rapes, murders, or high-level drug offenses.  (Note that certain factors can also result in consecutive sentences, such as gun &quot;enhancements&quot; which can add 5-25 years to a base sentence.)<p>Edit:  The above assumes the case even proceeds to the sentencing stage.  Several US courts have already ruled that merely hyperlinking is not enough; there must be an additional circumstance to make the hyperlinking illegal.  For example, if the information hyperlinked was clearly intended to be protected or private (i.e., Schwartz and the AT&T subscriber data), then dissemination of links <i>could</i> fall within the meaning of one or more statutes for unauthorized access.<p>A physical analogy to explain why this matters: a URL isn&#x27;t simply an address; it is a <i>path</i>, and this makes all the difference.  A p.o. address, for example, may tell you how to get to someone&#x27;s apartment but it wouldn&#x27;t tell you how to get up there if the front door is locked.   A URL is more akin to giving someone an address and telling them how to get inside.

As a developer, with social login, I have a username to link everything to just as much as normal server login. You can still have user records in your DB keyed on that, a settings page on your site that stores settings against that user, whatever you need. So how does removing social login improve personalization? I don&#x27;t think it does. Just sounds like an excuse.",1394003558

639411,comment,639139,639381,0,0,gojomo,,,"Using HEAD doesn't make a link-in-headers approach use less bandwidth than the classic /robots.txt convention. In the very best case -- no robots-rules -- a HEAD is equivalent in bandwidth used to a /robots.txt 404 without a content-body. But if there are robots-rules, the HEAD-then-robots approach means two hits and double-headers instead of one hit.<p>(It's possible to strain and devise a convention that uses less bandwidth; that's why I said 'probably'. But that would require even more complexity -- such as the server being smart enough to send each robot only the rules that apply to it.)<p>Configuring a server to emit special headers is also harder for most webmasters than dropping a text file into a conventional location. And a HEAD-then-robots process is more complicated for robots-writers.<p>For the purpose of warning off robots, the /robots.txt placement convention was a <i>very, very good solution</i> on many axes, including minimizing traffic and adoption costs.<p>Only a peculiar early-optimization based on a certain aesthetic sense -- and being concerned about being a bad example for <i>other</i> similar applications that aren't a pressing issue even now, 15 years later -- can justify Gregorio's opinion that /robots.txt ""was a not-so-good idea when the robot exclusion protocol was rolled out"".",1244015854

However, it suggests that money can't be a top-priority if you intend to work for your core values and change the world. If it is, all you ever get done is moving money from one place to another and nothing ever changes. To change the world, you just stop worrying and go make attempts at it, and then trust that you'll get enough money somewhere to keep your world-changing efforts uninterrupted.<p>It is my guess that many people on HN have these things much better aligned in their lives than a big proportion of non-HN people. The thought of being trapped in something you don't believe in for the sake of money and possessions probably appears a rather unsettling idea on this forum.",1244015357

In these cases, lacking a visual way to tell movement, the controller relies entirely on the accelerometer, which while theoretically capable, saturate very quickly with full body motion.<p>This is why in Raving Rabbids, where you have to play rabbid-DDR with the music, you have to jerk the controller - the accelerometer is neither reliable nor accurate enough to reliably infer your intentions through light motions.",1244014824

If the location were specified in the http headers then a robot could use the HEAD command first. That's relatively minor bandwidth cost and still lets the robot get the site rules without first getting any content.",1244013867

Like Corona trying to sell beer on a certain image of Mexico, Carlsberg is trying to sell beer on a certain image of Denmark.<p><i>Copenhagen had lots of visible social issues.</i><p>Interesting. Coming from the U.S., the lack of visible social issues is one of the more surprising things. Compared to other places I&#x27;ve lived, like San Francisco and Atlanta, everything feels much safer and better run. I don&#x27;t worry about walking home alone at 3am in Copenhagen the way I would even in nice parts of Atlanta. The public transit system is also much, much nicer than any other one I&#x27;ve used, generally being clean, on time, and running 24/7. I think the only place I&#x27;ve been that felt better-run and safer than Copenhagen was Zürich.<p><i>My friends all stayed at different AirBnBs across the city, and yet all of our apartments looked nearly identical: same floorboards, same IKEA furniture, even the exact same brand & size of TV.</i><p>I think this is more that AirBnB is only used by an narrow social segment. Residences I&#x27;ve been in vary from quasi-aristocratic decor (chandeliers, classical busts, etc., especially common in the inner city and Frederiksberg), to a minimalist &quot;design apartment&quot; style of all-white and geometric, and to a rustic look of dark wooden paneling and heavy dark-stained wooden furniture. The latter is what I think of as a &quot;typical&quot; Danish furnishing, but it&#x27;s more common in the homes of older people.",1422787877

8979614,comment,8977198,8979487,0,0,iakh,,,"One of the primary strategies I used as a day trader about 10 years ago is what this article describes as front-running (it is not front-running, because front-running is also illegal).  While the terminology may have changed since I was trading, the way it works is this.<p>When a large market order is placed with the exchange, the specialist (NYSE) would not have enough inventory to fill the entire order.  What they would do is go up the book and start combining higher limit orders to fill the volume.  He would also partially fill it with his own shares.  This was how the specialist made a lot of their money (I imagine) because it allowed them to fill orders outside the market rate.<p>What we would do as day traders is as soon as we saw a large order like this occur, we&#x27;d start placing orders outside the market rate on the other side, hoping to get filled when the specialist combines the whole trade at one price.  Once that happens, we can then sell that back to a market maker (at the market rate) or wait until the price moves back.<p>A few years after I stopped, the NYSE moved away from a specialist system (NASDAQ was never on one).  I haven&#x27;t followed the state of affairs since.  I imagine the same thing still happens now, but only you have to be much much faster to play the game with the hybrid/computer market makers.<p>source: had my series 7 about 10 years ago",1422786439

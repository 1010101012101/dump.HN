10875028,comment,10874671,10874671,0,0,DanBC,,,"> The visual scrapbook platform should be printing money. Its predominantly female audience browses Pinterest&#x27;s various boards for inspiration about their next fashion purchases, vacation destination, or on how to decorate a house — and they also act as free brand representatives by &quot;pinning&quot; their favorite products, making them visible to others.<p>Pinterest tried skimlinking, but the some of the userbase <i>hated</i> that, claiming it was hurting their business.<p>When I used Pinterest I would not have cared if they had used skimlinks for anything I posted, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option I can turn on.  And I want Pinterest to protect me from people posting their own affiliate links.  A bunch of people post low quality content and stuff it full of affiliate links.  Pinterest is worse with those people on the platform.  One thing it could do is skimlink everything, and charge for people who want to use their own affiliate links.  Most services provided to businesses are charged for, and allowing someone to run an affiliate marketing business on Pinterest is a service that Pinterest should charge for.<p>> You have a lot of lower-income, middle-America people on Pinterest than you do on other sites, and it&#x27;s very female-centric. So if you&#x27;re a marketer with a budget, where do you allocate it? Put it on Google or Facebook, where there are tons and tons of users where you can target very well? Or on Pinterest, which is a much smaller audience, female, lower-income, where you can&#x27;t target well? It&#x27;s just not as efficient.&quot;<p>Wait what? I see people pinning stuff for weddings (average cost of US wedding is $26k) or home redecoration (average cost of US kitchen remodeling is over $15k) so these may be lower income people, but they have something that they&#x27;re saving up for and are prepared to spend considerable amounts of money on.<p>Carefully placed ads could be amazing for that market.<p>The real problems with Pinterest are the <i>awful</i> <i>awful</i> <i>awful</i> mobile experience which is very hostile to the user. Almost embarrassing. I don&#x27;t post any links to Pinterest anywhere because of that hateful experience.",1452426894

Of course, headlines can wildly misrepresent the research they&#x27;re covering.  Of course, there may be issues at stake (such as, in this case, personal freedom) beyond the simple phenomenon being described.<p>However, if you have an issue with the research&#x27;s methodology, explain it.  It might even be a little interesting to hear a new conflicting hypothesis from your own anecdotal experiences.<p>As it happens, regarding the quality of pop-sci journalism, on this particular issue, the research on the starkly diminishing returns of overtime and the negative impact it has on work (especially creative work) is all pretty consistent.  For those who do not have the luxury of working in cushy chair-sitting industries like Mr. Carmack and myself, overtime is strongly correlated with an increase in industrial accidents, both fatal and otherwise.<p>I really wish that high-status people in the software industry would stop thinking that their success exempts them from cognitive bias and the need to make a rational argument, or that their experience writing software somehow transfers, with no particular education, to social science or management.<p>The problem with this opinion is neatly summed up by this statement:<p>> Given two equally talented people, the one that pursues a goal obsessively, for well over 40 hours a week, is going to achieve more.<p>which has been all but <i>proven</i> wrong by repeated scientific studies.  In the general case, it is not true.  In the specific cases of outliers where it appears to be true, my understanding of the research indicates that the &quot;People with the psychological makeup that allows them to productively pursue a goal obsessively for well over 40 hours a week will tend to be extremely successful&quot;.  But this attribute is highly unusual, and it may not be something you can cultivate; people who are taller also tend to do better in life, but that does not mean that the average person should torture themselves on the rack for 80 hours a week in the hopes of getting taller, either.",1452424568

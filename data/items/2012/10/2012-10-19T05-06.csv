Since the baseline MacMini probably isn't enough machine for most developers push that to $899 or $1099.<p>On the other side of that coin users are buying iOS devices which net Apple huge profits.

This was in June, I haven't re-tested recently.<p>- When CCBill had a bug bounty program I was able to gain access to their admin panel because it was publicly accessible and linked to via a directory index. That followed a story similar to the one here (I reported it, it was rejected as a duplicate, I followed up about a month later when it still wasn't patched and they quietly patched it and paid me money)<p>- Yandex recently launched a bug bounty program. So far I've submitted 3 or 4 issues. I've only heard about one of them: it was marked as a duplicate, which is fine, but weeks later the issue still isn't patched.<p>That being said there <i>are</i> companies like Google, Mozilla, Facebook, Etsy, GitHub, Reddit, and many others which take responsible disclosure of security issues seriously.

We have a cloud telephony platform called KooKoo(http://www.kookoo.in) in India which is pretty popular(handled more than 600 million calls in the last 18 months). We also have built a  virtual phone system product called BizPhone(http://www.bizphone.in) on top of KooKoo. BizPhone also has been pretty successful with a lot of SME and even enterprise customers in India using it. We have a couple of innovative features in addition to all the normal features of a virtual phone system which have been well received by our customers and they include:<p>1. Mobile app. Dial with your virtual phone number and manage all calls through the app. Also integrate with inbuilt CRM or other CRMs to show call pop details about the caller.<p>2. Call-Email-Contact management workflow. Just use your phone and email to manage all your contacts and tasks.<p>3. Task reminders through calls.<p>More details about our thoughts on improving business communications can be found at http://blog.bizphone.in/2012/07/redefining-small-business-communications.html<p>Since, it has been well received by businesses in India, we are now planning on launching BizPhone in the US. Just wanted to gauge the interest here before we do that. I know that the virtual phone system market in the US is much more mature with very good players like Grasshopper etc. But we think our product has some extra zing to it which will be liked by the customers. And of course, it will be cheaper :)<p>So please upvote this if you think there is space for another virtual phone system or leave some comments if you think the market is saturated or you have some advice for us.<p>You can also reach me directly at chaitanya [at] ozonetel [dot] com and my BizPhone number is +91-40-66588321",1350625308

It's quieter (perceptibly so) and is nothing like the traditional ""whining"" fan; it sounds more like white noise. In my rMBP, I'll intentionally max out the fans when playing a game (to reduce heat on my hands) and the sound isn't really noticeable at all. It sounds like the ambient noise from my air conditioner or the highway near my house; in fact it's so close that I literally can't hear the laptop if I'm sitting on my balcony.<p>That said, I think you're significantly overstating the noise of a modern Mac in the first place. Some of the non-retina MBPs run pretty warn, but my last-gen Air was silent unless I tried to play games on it. Even when writing code.

You need at least $36k a year just to rent a decent flat in that place, some families, not just people but actual families, live on less than that in this country.<p>I had friends on highschool who had tremendous hacker potential, but they also had problems, REAL problems like bad health and a poor family. Most of them are quite happy right now working for the evil corporations that pay them those $75k a year salaries that the rich kids laugh at. They depend on company healthcare and can't even dream to let that and their paychecks go just to give startups a try.<p>And that is just one side of the problem, the other is the facade of equal opportunities in startups, the idea that everyone applying to YC or other incubators is in the same level.<p>The social network movie made a lot of generic hacker culture statements but it forgot to mention that the zuck had a private programming tutor paid by his parents. Seriously, how many of you here had parents who could afford that? I tried to hire a Java tutor when I was in highschool and it was incredibly expensive, more than hiring several tutors for most of my school subjects.<p>I have met entrepreneurs with amazing companies that didn't get into YC, yet the guys from diaspora, the same guys who burned through a quarter of a million and did next to nothing, they got in, and with what? a meme app, because that's important, another memegenerator clone.<p>I'm using a throwaway account because I know this is going to be downvoted to hell, many of these rich kids make an overwhelming clique in HN and other sites, and they don't like when it when someone speaks up and shatters their BS.<p>The irony here is that this country is fast becoming like the third world hellholes that immigrant entrepreneurs where escaping from. The stories you hear from those places are becoming eerily familiar: a guy from South America told me how over there all entrepreneurs are rich kids, legacies from generations of crony capitalism and favoritism. Practically none are coders or hustlers, they get their parents to bankroll a clone a cookie-cutter startup and take advantage of the wage slave condition of engineers over there, after all what are those poor souls going to do? they can't afford to make a startup and don't have any connections to investors, so what is left for them? get a visa and come here? nice try...<p>And that is what America is becoming, a place not of opportunity but of class lockdown, social mobility is at an all-time low and everywhere you hear pundits whose idea of equality in America is actually that of Sweden's, which ironically is a socialist country.<p>But go ahead, keep believing we are all in the same league, by all means try to defeat my point by saying how you <i>help</i> other less fortunate entrepreneurs with your link-bait blog full of empty advice, keep saying that all of us who are not in the same position than you are a bunch of envious and resentful pricks, or that you are where you are right now because you worked for it when actually you are where you are right now because you were half the way ahead to being with.",1350625096

If it's bad enough they'll do refunds, but you need to push them and they won't always grant them if you don't ask in a timely manner.<p>More troubling, they sell games that they know are broken. Full Spectrum Warrior is one example that I can think of. The game tries to resolve a no-longer existing address hundreds of times a second and lags horribly. It's easily fixed but Steam support doesn't care because it's not Valve's game.<p>Steam does a lot of things right, but it's very much a buyer beware situation, and for higher stakes than a $0.99 app.",1350625038

It can be a highly tuned system that takes the most out of your hardware or it can be an ethereal, ubiquitous cloud service that's available regardless of hardware. <i>But not both.</i>""<p>Emphasis added there at the end.<p>My claim is that ""we"", folks who engineer software and create products, have made those software products indispensable to folks who never used to care about computers much less shell out money to own one. They never did want to buy a computer, they don't want to buy one now, what they want is the <i>function</i> that is provided by some app or collection of apps. These people want to follow tweets, or facebook, or chat, or see cat pictures, they buy computers to do that because they have to, not because they want to. What is worse, the 'computerness' of computers, their re-programability, their flexibility, causes more problems for these people than it solves. They want turn-key, instant on, instant off, tools.<p>And folks are making these tools for them, Chromebooks, and iPhones, and iPads, and Slates and Surfaces. They are marketed as tools that get a particular job done, not a universal tool. Can you imagine a power drill where you take the motor off and use it in your mixer, then take it off and use it in your desk fan, and then take it off and use it to pump water and wash your deck? No you get separate tools for those tasks, and they all have a motor in them but the motor isn't universal, its optimized for the tool. We are moving that way with processors. No more 'boot whatever you want' no more manuals describing the instruction set or peripherals, no more general purpose tool chains or operating systems. Processors designed to do one thing well like be a 'phone' with proprietary value added parts (like a GPU) and special instructions (like Jazelle) which you only get to know about if you agree to buy a million a month and design it into your specialized product.<p>The needs of an operating system for one of those devices is very much different than the needs for a programmer or developer's operating system. Sure they share some things in common (both render to a screen) but how or when they do that, and what API they use, those things are important to a developer but not to a tool/appliance user.<p>Yason is exactly correct that Ubuntu is standing astride this crevice while it widens underneath them.

People around see it as a use-and-throw framework as it is suitable to start a project but not end with it.  
There have been a lot of brouhaha about it, mostly because of its noisy Twitter roots and it looks to have won over HTML5boilerplate or 960 grid systems. 
It certainly has lot of juice than its competitors, but it is having its fair share of criticism. I have personally used for some projects but I usually find it bloat. Yet it works most of the times. Its mobile architecture is flawless.
Yes, there are no fancy design elements apart from colored buttons, rounded corners etc. and it requires adding a lot of backgrounds, borders etc. to make it appealing for a common website.
Can some experienced minds on HN enlighten more for Bootstrap or, if it is not a right way, a suitable alternative which can look good on every hardware. Infinite grid, at http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-infinite-grid/ looks promising, but the execution is flawed.",1350624826

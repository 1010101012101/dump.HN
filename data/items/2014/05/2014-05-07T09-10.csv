It was necrotizing fasciitis, so no worries.<p>A dead parent is a loss that happens once, but a parent that rejects you happens constantly, every single moment of your shared lifetime. The consistency of the selfishness is what gets you. No matter how often you forget about it, one day it is there again. This birthday was ignored too.<p>I grew up envying the ones whose parents had died. More recently, I&#x27;ve met people with abusive parents.

It stops the bikeshedding type arguments, true, but it also stops potentially illuminating comparisons. Can we, as a community, agree to stop bringing it up in comparison arguments?<p>Imagine a new programming language and system being presented in an article. It is healthy and useful for the article to say &quot;We designed system X so it is easier to express Y kind of programs. A, B, C are the complications encountered when doing the same with systems I, J, K.&quot; rather than &quot;We designed system X to express Y kind of programs.

7658416,comment,7658103,7658337,1,0,NamTaf,,,"For the brands mentioned, I broadly agree with them this time round in my limited experience, but I can&#x27;t really judge more broadly than a few brands there and as others have mentioned, they notably miss any Beyerdynamic offerings.<p>It really depends what you want. I have a pair of the Koss KSC-75 for my portable use and they&#x27;re fantastic. They cost about $50 and are clip-over-the-ear sort of things but have some of the best sound below $100.<p>For home use, I use a good ol&#x27; pair of the Alessandro MS-1 (which are essentially the Grado SR80i, albeit with some slight differences that make them more preferable to most). They&#x27;re also an open headphone but are fantastic and come in at about $125-$150. They excel more at the rock end of the spectrum and aren&#x27;t heavy on bass, so if you like thumping dance music then maybe avoid them but that&#x27;s not to say the bass isn&#x27;t there. They&#x27;re a good, balanced offering for all types of music listening.<p>Note that both of the above are <i>open</i> headphones, so they will not block external noise. Depending on your use case (e.g.: isolation for coding) this may be a major downfall. Open headphones are invariably better audio quality for the equivalent price however, so you&#x27;re hard pressed to get a good set of cheap closed headphones.<p>I&#x27;m happy to recommend both, depending on what you want to do with them. Alternatively, there&#x27;s a fantastic website run by some knowledgable people who can give you some input even if you don&#x27;t end up ordering from them, at www.headphones.com.au .

Most of their stuff is marketed for industry, so this makes them a bit &quot;underground.&quot;<p>Further, most of their line is designed for industry or hardcore audiophiles: a lot of it is high-impedance (200 Ohm+), which means you need a real amplifier to drive them (otherwise they&#x27;ll be pretty quiet), making them not a great portable solution. For comparison, consumer-type stuff is typically standardized 8/16/32 Ohms.<p>Even further still, their headphones are designed for accuracy, which consumers don&#x27;t always want either (... subconsciously).

7658398,comment,7654392,7654392,2,0,gregfjohnson,,,"1 - Getting the Celestron Ultima 2000 &quot;goto&quot; telescope debugged and working.  There were all kinds of problems:  the software was a home-brew multi-threaded real-time operating system that ran on tiny little inexpensive processors, and had a lot of bugs.  The closed loop control algorithms were broken.  When we started, the telescope would go into &quot;paint can shaker&quot; mode when we told it to move to a star.  The mechanical design had a lot of problems and went through several redesigns.  There were problems with the encoders (sinusoidal errors too large to ignore, which ended up requiring software calibration and compensation), and the main axes were not sufficiently close to perpendicular, also requiring per-system calibration and software compensation.  There were electrical problems requiring strategically placed capacitors and things.  For crying out loud, we even had a Y2K problem!  The scope had difficulty tracking objects over the zenith.  The gearboxes had a significant amount of backlash, requiring software compensation.  And on and on.  It was an extremely difficult system to get working, but in the end it was the most satisfying thing I&#x27;d done in my career to that point.  (And, it was nice to do something as a software guy for my father, Tom Johnson, the founder of Celestron.)<p>2 - The Integrated Medical Systems LS-1, a portable &quot;ICU in a box&quot; done under contract for the US Army.  The box integrated multiple medical device subsystems (ventilator, ECG, infusion pumps, smart battery charging, invasive and non-invasive blood pressure, SpO2, etc. etc.)  They communicated internally over 100-base-T cat-5, and also had to interface to hospital IT via wifi.  And, there was a remote interface unit that had to be able to remotely monitor and control the entire system via internet, from the other side of the planet if necessary.  We ended up doing a lot of work to ensure that the system performed exactly as expected and required by clinicians, even in these sort of remote-operation scenarios.  (The thing the Army wanted was to have video and audio from the bedside to remote clinicians, and have the remote people act like team members that were coordinating their efforts with the bedside clinical team.)<p>3 - (Totally for the hell of it, in hobby mode)  I was reading a bit about Shor&#x27;s algorithm to use quantum computing to factor products of pairs of prime numbers.  One key part of the algorithm depends on FFT&#x27;s, to help with detection of lengths of cycles.  If you have a vector of length N, consisting of K equally spaced non-zero elements, and K evenly divides N, then the FFT of that vector will have N/K evenly spaces non-zero elements, and crucially they will start in the zero&#x27;th element of the output vector.  (There is no such requirement or assumption on the input side.)  Happily enough, this is &quot;almost&quot; true if K does not happen to evenly divide N.  But this is a bit difficult to prove.  Some reasonably complete and rigorous presentations of quantum computing basically say, &quot;The proof of this is outside of the scope of the present work.&quot;  So, for fun I took it as a challenge to create an elementary proof of this lemma.  It turned out to be quite hard, but REALLY fun and satisfying.<p>4 - Never been really happy with the standard presentations of red-black tree algorithms.  It just felt like there was some underlying simplicity in there that was struggling to get out.  So, I created a new formulation of red-black trees and corresponding algorithms.  Did a web site (gregfjohnson.com/redblackbuilder.html) that illustrates these algorithms, and supports forward and backward execution and single-stepping through the algorithms.  This web site was pretty darn hard to get correct.",1398664100

Here simultaneous could mean interleaved (multi-threading on a single core) or at the same time, but the <i>interacting</i> with each other part is key. They have to communicate, they have to communicate what they know about the world, what they know can change...they necessarily share state whether explicit or not.<p>Parallelism is is actually doing stuff at the same time, usually for a performance benefit, in which case, you aren&#x27;t going to be using any of these slow FP languages anyways (but there is always Java + MapReduce, which is kind of functional). Your Erlang code will run &quot;faster&quot; relative to single core Erlang code, but if you honestly believe that you are being parallel fast...<p>> Because it keeps things (including faults, but also logical decomposition) simple.

It was way too much work to try off the bat in order to get a working printer.<p>After a run-in with a RepRap Mondo (it&#x27;s big but it has a lot of issues, the design ended up not being that popular) bits-for-bytes RapMan printers (purchased by the industrial engineering department) and MakerBots (some folks at a local TechShop had them), we eventually got an Ultimaker kit.<p>It was amazing.  Fast prints, cheap (compared to some), good-quality software, the assembly was straightforward and fast, instructions were thorough (compared to many other printers we&#x27;ve worked with), and print quality was good with almost no tuning.<p>Now graduated, I own an Ultimaker and whole-heartedly recommend it.  Not only is it a good printer by itself, it has quite a clever community of inventors around it, and 3D-printed parts and improvements to Ultimakers appear with shocking regularity. (As opposed to makerbot, which is more of a professional printer in that less folks tend to modify them).<p>Cura, the software used to control ultimaker, has come leaps and bounds farther than what it started as.  It&#x27;s now easily mistaken for professional paid software, and it&#x27;s easy enough that even someone with no experience can hop on and start printing.<p>Also shout-out to octoprint, which uses a Raspberry Pi to control the printer (3-hours of printing an awesome part rock, but not having your laptop tied to the printer for that long).<p><a href=""https://www.ultimaker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ultimaker.com/</a>",1398663681

The kit had an aluminum frame (there are also wood frames which are a little less expensive) and was sourced from a person who runs workshops, so I had confidence that it would have most of the parts I would need. I bought it on eBay for $680, though you can find them cheaper.<p>There are probably better printers out there. I&#x27;ve heard good things about the Printrbot. A friend has one of the earlier wood framed ones. He likes it. We saw the new metal ones at MS Build a couple of weeks ago and the prints were excellent. The reason I chose the RepRap is that it&#x27;s open source end-to-end: hardware, electronics (Arduino Mega), firmware, and software. We&#x27;ve had good results with Repetier Host and Slicer. I like the ethos of the community and the idea that it is (at least somewhat) a self-replicating machine.<p>The main thing about 3D printing is that it&#x27;s a constant effort to fiddle and tune. It took us a couple of weeks to get it printing well. We printed some replacement parts and printed enhanced parts--for example, a pulley tensioner.<p>One of our early challenges was getting the right surface for the initial layer. The printing bed is glass, with a heating element underneath. The heating is optional and is mainly used with ABS plastic (petroleum based). We use PLA (vegetable based), which doesn&#x27;t release the noxious fumes. It&#x27;s probably the most common plastic used in consumer 3D printing. Many people use blue painters tape on the glass. The plastic tends to adhere pretty well. We tried that and moved to PET tape. There are lots of resources for tweaking your recipe here.<p>For filament, we use 3mm diameter, because that&#x27;s the type of hot end that came with our kit. Most printers are now using 1.2mm, which is thus more readily available. The MakerBots use that, so you can even find it in some retail stores. We might print out a new extruder and get a 1.2mm head, but our extruder is working well, we have a good source for consistent spools (MatterHackers--great service from them) and so I don&#x27;t have a good reason to change right now.<p>So it&#x27;s a constant effort to calibrate, tweak, and tune, but  it&#x27;s been worth it. My son has it running all the time. We&#x27;ve gone through several pounds of plastic. We download most of our stuff from Thingiverse, but have also designed and printed our own custom items. I&#x27;m very busy, but it&#x27;s a very manageable hobby. In our case, the big time investment was two long weekend days to assemble it. I can highly recommend it if you have some technical aptitude, patience, and a little extra time. It really does feel like we&#x27;re seeing the future. Being part of it is pretty fun.",1398663604

Under reduction-based scheduling, context switches are a <i>possible</i> side-effect of exactly one operation: function calls/returns. This means that it&#x27;s very easy to reason about when context switches <i>won&#x27;t</i> happen (so it&#x27;s not hard to write atomic code), while not having to worry about <i>making</i> them happen yourself (because, in a language that defines looping in terms of recursion, all code-paths have a known-finite sequence of steps before either a function call or a return.)",1398663268

It may not be bug free (I don&#x27;t know that any language can claim a bug free standard library), but it&#x27;s damn close.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious you haven&#x27;t spent much time at all with Erlang based on your points here:<p>- Claiming &quot;X is fast, Y isn&#x27;t&quot; is not even an argument, you should&#x27;ve just left that out.<p>- Arguments about syntax are rather pointless, but Erlang has very consistent syntax, and it&#x27;s small. You can pick up Erlang in a couple of hours if you are familiar with FP concepts.<p>- I haven&#x27;t encountered any real problems working with strings in Erlang. It may not have a bunch of standard library functions for manipulating them, but it&#x27;s pretty trivial to do most things you would in any other language. It makes up for it with how much of a breeze it is to work with binary data.<p>- As mentioned previously, structs aren&#x27;t datastructures, and Erlang has an equivalent (records) for those anyway. Erlang has trees, maps, tuples, lists - I would consider those a lot more obvious and necessary.<p>- Erlang and Go are both general purpose programming languages. They don&#x27;t share the same design goals though. You could write a Go program to do a poor approximation of what Erlang is good at, and vice versa, the point though is to use the proper tool depending on the application.

Find out what career fairs you can attend at your own university or other universities. Talk to everyone there, companies and fellow job hunters. Exchange information and stories. Don&#x27;t just send job applications through the university job board.<p>2. Start socializing. Join a coworking space and talk to people, find out what they&#x27;re working on and help them for free (for a short time) and prove your worth. Tell anyone who is willing to listen that you&#x27;re looking for work. Sites like Reddit and Twitter are great resources - go to meetups (any kind, even social ones!) or join Toastmasters to meet other people. Make new contacts and help them; they will help you back.<p>3. If you&#x27;re really looking for any kind of work, then find a job in retail or part-time in any field and look for work all the time. Or start a small business to keep yourself busy and motivated. It does not have to be a technology-related! Freelance on odesk or even Fiverr. It will keep you going until you find full-time work. Talk to customers and mention that you are looking for work! Remember that business always comes down to people.<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t feel guilty about your parents&#x27; investment in your education, they wanted to help you so that you could be successful.

Yes, we stick the infinity symbol below many a limit, but re-phrase the limit into epsilon-delta language and the infinity disappears along with the associated philosophical difficulty.<p>The extra 1/4 is where the trouble starts.

Objects were designed for personal computers and building and using software designed for personal computers.<p>While shared workspace environments were explored in systems like Self, they were always designed around the objects being these visual instances running in a GUI.<p>Objects detached from a system like Self or Smalltalk lose a lot of their powers of abstraction. They are not and have never been portable, even if they were designed to be reusable.",1398661549

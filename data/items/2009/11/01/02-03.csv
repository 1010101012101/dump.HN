I like combinations such as #000 on #fcfaf4.<p>2. Larger font size makes up for lower contrast. The proportions can be correct, but if the text is low contrast the size should be upped to compensate.

Your definition of correct does not agree with mine.<p>If you draw a line parallel to the left-hand edge of your monitor down from the character that the cursor is currently over, it should touch the character that ""next-line"" will move to.  That is not what happens when you use a proportional font in Emacs.  (If you are on the 10th character of the line, you will move to the 10th character of the next line.)<p>What happens makes mathematical sense, but Emacs is a visual editor.  Programmed text editing is nice, but sometimes you notice a visual property of the source code, and would like to exploit that instead of some lexical property.  Visual editing lets you do this, but proportional fonts destroy this ability.<p>Anyway, sorry to hear about the Python style guidelines.  If I did Python, I would ignore that one.

914528,comment,914045,914385,0,0,crux,,,"Well, part of it comes down to the fact that the text is read differently, depending on whether it's block letters or code. If you're writing prose, you process most text on a word-by-word basis, if not sentence-by-sentence. For instance, periods have very little spacing around them because there actually doesn't need to be that much more distance between letters at sentence boundaries—periods are not crucial characters, and thus do not have to be marked off from other letters. They are themselves boundary markers.<p>The situation is different with code. Every character that you type, unless it's within a comment, is very important. It's even quite possible that accidentally putting two spaces after a period might have some semantic effect, and it's <i>certainly</i> possible that having two periods instead of one will have some semantic effect. The programmer absolutely must be able to easily read code on a character-by-character basis, and thus he wants a typeface that treats each letter absolutely equally. It's only slightly distracting if your W is wider than your L, disrupting the natural grid of your text. But in a language where punctuation is just as important as the words themselves, you might just as well be troubled if your periods or commas have a tendency to disappear into the flow of letters.<p>Not to mention that there is nearly no block text font that has as much of an interest in differentiating I/l/1 and 0/O as programming/monospace fonts do.",1257040846

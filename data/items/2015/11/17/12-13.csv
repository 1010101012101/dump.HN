10580730,comment,10580208,10580509,0,0,pluma,,,"Better the devil you know.<p>The reason we (i.e. &quot;The West&quot;) left Saddam in place until the US needed an easy target after 9/11 is that despite being a dictator and mass-murderer, his reign kept Iraq relatively stable. As soon as he was taken out of the equation other forces began to fight for dominance and now we have a huge mess on our hands that&#x27;s arguably worse than where we started.<p>The same is true for most of the dictatorships toppled during the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. This is partially why Russia was against intervening in Syria from day one and why nobody seems to think Saudi Arabia or Qatar or any of the other bloody dictatorships in that region are worth disrupting.<p>In many cases the actual borders of these countries are pretty arbitrary and split up various ethno-religious groups (that often historically hate each others&#x27; guts) in weird ways. As soon as you tell them to self-govern and dispose of the dictators you end up with all these directly opposing interest groups suddenly being able to get at each others&#x27; throats.<p>It&#x27;s not that Assad is a nice person or that it&#x27;s more ethical to leave an evil person in place than to dispose of him, it&#x27;s just that mindlessly handing out guns and expecting an oppressed people to be rational is pretty much the worst thing you can do.<p>Look at WW2 Germany. Sure, we got rid of Hitler, but in order to prevent Germany from blowing up again (exactly what had happened after WW1) the Allies actually had to work out long-term plans for the occupation of Germany to make sure the citizens were educated enough to understand how messed up their world view used to be and that the country was re-integrated into world economy and politics.<p>We need a Marshall Plan for Syria with buy-in from several major influencers. THEN we can talk about disposing of Assad.",1447765110

I have read multiple times that Isis has amongst its member ex Baathist officer from Saddam, Ba&#x27;ath party which was at least originally more secular and left-leaning. I am pretty sure that some of these people are not that into the religious aspect, except as a recruiting and propaganda tool.<p>The way I see it is that using the &quot;Islam&quot; brand is great way to have funds and international support/appeal.<p>In the same way, in the sixties, you had plenty of nationalist movements all over the world that were claiming to be Communist. Sure it was also the hand of Moscow at work, but for local people, that was also a great way to secure some funding/weapons/etc from USSR.<p>Also some of the bomber have allegedly married in Syria, possibly with children, I am not sure what would happen to their family if they defected.",1447765006

10580723,comment,10580208,10580597,0,0,stoolpigeon,,,"Since you sound interested I&#x27;ll give you my take. I work in tech but I do it as an evangelical missionary. I think I&#x27;m not too far outside the norm (as much as there is such a thing) for an American protestant. Of course the answers to your questions can vary pretty widely based on who you ask but that leads me to think you might be interested in hearing from more than one person.<p>1.) The boundary of my beliefs - in terms of people offending me by what they say or write - I really don&#x27;t care and don&#x27;t get offended. I have zero expectation for people who don&#x27;t adhere to my beliefs to say things in line with them. If another person who is a Christian says things I think are really out of line, it wouldn&#x27;t offend me but I&#x27;d try to engage them and work it out - but people who don&#x27;t believe in it, I don&#x27;t expect to act like they do. If a person who is of another faith or an atheist is interested in discussing something like the validity of the Bible, I&#x27;m happy to have that discussion as long as it is a real discussion. If it&#x27;s a debate with us just mindlessly exchanging arguments, I have better things to do.<p>2) I don&#x27;t think IT and religion are at odds in any way. The tension happens more at the level of your next question. IT is too far removed from those fundamental questions. In fact, as someone who&#x27;s life is focused on sharing a message with as many people as possibe, IT is awesome.<p>3) This is trickier. If something is for sure a scientific fact and it conflicts with what I believe my faith teaches about the nature of the world then my assumption is that I&#x27;ve somehow misunderstood what my faith teaches. The only authority I recognize for this is the Bible - so to simplify the discussion - if a fact contradicts what I believe the Bible says then I assume my understanding of the Bible is wrong and I adjust. For your two examples - coming to understand evolution and fit it into my faith has been an on-going process for me over a lot of year. The Big Bang is something that fits my world view better than one that proposes God does not exist.<p>4) Same as above but I think that a lot of what people believe to be &quot;historically proofed facts&quot; about the Bible are in fact wrong and reflect a lack of information with regards to current knowledge on history. A lot of theories about when parts of the Bible were written and who wrote them rest on the bias of the theories authors rather than any facts. For instance I believe the New Testament was written by people who knew Jesus Christ, saw what he did in person or knew people from that group. I do not think it was written much later by people creating a religion.<p>If I were to find out something I believe to be true is absolutely false - I would evaluate and adjust. I&#x27;ve done it in my lifetime. It&#x27;s something I do about more than just my faith. My politics have changed during my adult life and lots of beliefs I have, have moved as I experience more and learn more. I&#x27;ve been living in Europe for 4 years, for example, and in that time I&#x27;ve changed my mind about lots of things. It has been a real education. I don&#x27;t cling blindly to any opinon. I don&#x27;t mindlessly follow any &#x27;leaders&#x27; teaching or instructions.<p>Hope that&#x27;s the kind of feedback you are interested in - if you want to continue the discussion feel free to email me if that&#x27;s easier than here - bittercode@gmail.com",1447764975

10580714,comment,10579975,10580615,0,0,simonh,,,">The article appears to be implying that Western nations should not make war against Daesh because &quot;that&#x27;s what they want.&quot;...<p>I agree the article spends a lot of time implying what we shouldn&#x27;t do and not much time at all saying what might make for effective policies, but it&#x27;s hardly advocating Islamising Europe either.<p>I took two things away from the article. One is that the kind of pretty much deliberate social and economic marginalization of Muslim minorities in France is a terrible mistake. You can have a pluralistic egalitarian society without insisting that everyone has to dress, talk and behave exactly like white western Europeans all the time. Having an Imperial legacy and historic connections with extensive regions of the wider world isn&#x27;t compatible with being culturally allergic to anyone who looks or acts foreign. We in Europe need to build strong cultural bridges connecting us to the Muslim minorities in our midst that are now also Europeans and deserve respect and support. I may take flak for this, because it turns my stomach to imply that France has any responsibility for the recent attacks, but frankly the French state is not doing it&#x27;s job.<p>The second lesson is regarding our foreign policy in the Middle East. Keeping out of Syria and letting whatever happens just happen hasn&#x27;t worked. The result has been a breeding ground for radicalization and chaos that has exacerbated the situation in Iraq, and lead to the biggest Refugee crisis Europe has seen since WW2. The Iraq war was awful and the political pressure to withdraw and &#x27;bring the troops home&#x27; intense, but doing so was a horrible mistake. Once you&#x27;re in, you&#x27;re in for better or worse. We can&#x27;t wash our hands of these conflicts and expect that the resulting mess will stay put and not affect us.<p>As a corollary, I think that our consistent policy that none of the borders in the Middle east are up for negotiation is a mistake. If the Sunni, Shia and Kurd regions of Iraq want to be separate states, they should have the freedom to do so. Trying to insist that the Sunni minority had to stay welded to a larger hostile Shia population was just asking for unending trouble. Partition isn&#x27;t always the right answer, but in some situations it needs to be an option.",1447764866

The break between catholics and eastern orthodox happened in what is called &quot;the great schism&quot; in the 11th century. It has been attributed to theological disputes by the church, but nobody believes that, as everybody knows the dispute was entirely political in nature.<p>And the blend of eastern orthodoxy from my country has its own flavor, compared to the the general eastern orthodoxy branch, as we&#x27;ve also picked up a set of local customs and traditions along the way. Consequently I think this is why, even though atheism is on the rise and even though I&#x27;m what you could call an agnostic, I happen to believe that religion is ultimately good, as it&#x27;s a part of the local culture, the local culture being a huge part of our identity.<p>But speaking of Christianity, our local christians tend to be a little xenophobe. And this I never understood why it happens, because you know, Christianity being about the teachings of Christ above all else, with those teaching inviting us first and foremost to love our peers and to be more tolerant. Skipping over the obvious that sometimes Christianity has nothing to do with the teaching of Christ, I personally think it&#x27;s more about the true human nature. I believe that in essence a large part of the population is xenophobe, fearing and hating what is different and the material is always there to be exploited by a capable leader that can canalize all that potential hatred towards a common goal that can blur our ethics. After all, we should always remember the nazis, as that&#x27;s the history that shows us how an otherwise civilized society can turn overnight if you press the right buttons, the anti-pattern we should steer away from.<p>Which brings me to the point that I wanted to make. I see a lack of tolerance and hatred even in many atheists, having the same potential for evil as everybody else, atheists who otherwise claim to be more enlightened. Not all of them of course, just like how not all Muslims are jihadists. And so I don&#x27;t think changing the naming would make that much of a difference.",1447763643

Contemporary radical Islam is a response to Western modernity and perceived decadence and has been brewing for decades if not centuries. It is an outgrowth of Salafi Islam, a severely literal interpretation of the Koran that has become widespread over the past 70 years thanks to trillions of petrodollars that fund thousands of fundamentalist madrassas and other cultural dissemination centers all over the world, including in the United States and Western Europe.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that ISIS, al Qaeda, al nusra etc. are Sunni movements and are bitterly opposed to Shi&#x27;ism. The rise of Shi&#x27;a political power, led by Iran since 1980, poses a huge ideological threat.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing today is a tiny group of very clever, highly motivated people, patiently watching for opportunities to sow chaos because they believe it will tip the scales eventually toward a Caliphate. They are hugely aided by technology and by the West&#x27;s earnest desire to integrate the East.<p>However, I believe the ISIS is doomed to failure. There are only so many young people willing to sacrifice everything for fanatic dreams of afterlife fulfillment as payment for promises of improving the here-now. Most youth, in other words, aren&#x27;t that stupid. ISIS is siphoning off a certain kind of malcontents who make good fodder for the cannons, but history has shown that this approach is not sustainable. The Muslim world is already showing signs of backlash against the constant images of extreme violence, and reformists continue to call for tolerance and dialogue as the only true solution to territorial and ideological differences.<p>Whether the Levant succumbs to unending civil war for the next few decades, or is ultimately dominated by a set of secular dictatorships that suppress the jihadists, or can they achieve peaceful multiplayer democracy--these are questions to which no one has the answers.",1447763275

Religion is the center of their beliefs, and a very important factor that drives their actions. When the Boston bomber says &quot;Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven, how can you compete with that?&quot; he is not lying. This is what these people truly believe. They think the metaphysics of this universe works as follows. You walk into a theatre full of people with an assault rifle and start shooting people. This ensures your place in heaven next to God. Then you press the button on your suicide vest to teleport into heaven. Imagine that you were living in the Matrix but instead of a telephone, death is what lets you out of the Matrix. Furthermore, outside of the Matrix there is somebody who has been keeping score and this makes the difference between eternal bliss or eternal torture. The robots that run the Matrix have <i>really</i> engineered the world that way. This is what these people believe, or at least a medieval version of it.<p>Another example is the Heaven&#x27;s Gate suicide cult. Instead of being based on Islam they were based on Christianity.

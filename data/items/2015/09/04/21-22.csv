How do you propose we do that?<p>The reality is that this program is doing something achievable to address the effects of racism. No, it isn&#x27;t directly tackling the causes of it. There is no reason why we cannot do both.<p>Proposing this &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach almost always ends up with &quot;nothing&quot;, and it&#x27;s almost always proposed by people who do not see the benefit of these programs.<p>Edit: just noticed <i>your</i> edit.

Yes, the current numbers are awful, but they must get better in the future.  If they don&#x27;t get better, the US will end up as 90% poor and 10% CEOs.  Many racial-cultural ghettos throughout the country do exist and drive down the future potential of millions of children, but everybody won&#x27;t stay there forever.  Maybe it only takes a few breakthrough tech successes to set the stage—people to look up to, not &quot;smart is bad&quot; culture.<p>(Also, with current numbers, there are isolated <i>pockets</i>.  Sure baltimore is 65% black, but that doesn&#x27;t put pressure on employee availability (employers can relocate people from elsewhere).  But when the entire country is 80% mixed hispanic-white-black-chinese in 100 years, employees must come from society as a whole somewhere.)<p>It is a <i>generational</i> problem and it will take another one to three generations to fully be considered a non-issue anymore.  (Assuming, at some point, the US decides to invest in education and children and growth again instead of choking off all avenues of social mobility as have been routine for the past dozen years.)",1441403876

I&#x27;ve been doing detailed planning for my own vision for a collaborative DAW for years now, though various other projects have kept distracting me from giving it enough coding time to get it off the ground!<p>I&#x27;m curious how you&#x27;re thinking of solving latency & disconnection issues between participants. It looks like you&#x27;re representing things as a sequential list of transactions, and immutable transactions are definitely the starting point for everything I&#x27;ve considered! The question is: what happens if multiple people send each other conflicting transactions at the same time? Google Wave solved this by enforcing a single server-side ordering of all events, and making sure that all transactions would be accepted using Operational Transformation even if they occurred out of order. Without OT, you may have cases where Alice makes a change, only to have it invalidated and essentially erased by Bob&#x27;s change that may have &quot;won&quot; on the server side. And while OT may be largely &quot;solved&quot; for text content, it doesn&#x27;t seem well-studied for music or other timeline-based content.<p>As an alternative, source control manages to get along fine without automated conflict resolution/OT, since we&#x27;re willing to dive into merge conflicts and resolve things ourselves. So theoretically, you could create &quot;Git for Music&quot; and drive that from your app. But what&#x27;s the UI equivalent of version control in a DAW? What, exactly, does a &quot;diff&quot; look like in musical notation? And how do you make it unobtrusive to non-coder musicians?<p>All very interesting problems, and it&#x27;s always great to have multiple innovators in this space!

I probably just worded this poorly, to give the implication that coding capability was limited to proteins.  It&#x27;s just that most people at the time thought that DNA was found in either nA (a string of As), nT, nG, or nC, or random arrangements.  More than anything people just didn&#x27;t think that DNA could &quot;code&quot; for anything, while proteins could, because people didn&#x27;t seem to realize that unique sequences of heteropolymers was a valid form of coding.

This means that users (both people who use the stable kernels directly, and people who make distribution kernels) need to either diverge from the upstream stable point releases, or test thoroughly before shipping/deploying, which increases update latency significantly. Point releases cannot be used directly as urgent security updates.<p>* Not all security fixes are backported to stable point releases in the first place, because the development culture encourages thinking of them as &quot;normal bugs&quot;, and not all normal bugs are obviously worth backporting fixes for (otherwise why have a separate branch). It&#x27;s entirely possible to send a security patch to the kernel, not say it&#x27;s security-related (because you&#x27;re asked not to), and have it fail to go to stable. It&#x27;s entirely possible for a patch to be quietly dropped because it&#x27;s too much effort to backport -- again, the lack of difference from &quot;normal bugs&quot; means that there&#x27;s no guarantee that  security bug fixes will get backported.<p>* Aggressive commitment to an unstable kernel API, let alone ABI, means that stable point releases require rebuilding third-party modules, and may break them, and that there&#x27;s absolutely no way for a good portion of users to even be on the latest stable point release. RHEL has its massive awful backport series, where the kernel in current, supported RHEL releases does not resemble either the original branch point or the current upstream very well, because their customers are paying them to for <i>reliably</i> being able to upgrade to RHEL-released kernels.<p>* As a result of the last two bullet points, there&#x27;s a lot of divergence between the upstream kernel and what people actually run, which is what Linus is getting at in these posts, when he says, correctly, that <i>him</i> identifying security bugs would be more helpful to attackers than legitimate users. But there&#x27;s no interest in making that not be the case in the first place.<p>I have a bunch of more minor complaints (the number of security <i>misfeatures</i> in the kernel like /dev/random and Linux &quot;capabilities&quot;, which indicate the lack of a healthy security development culture, and the aggressive / personality-based management style, which may be conducive to certain development goals but cannot be conducive to security).<p>To be fair, this is a completely valid philosophy for a project to have. There are good reasons to decide that security is just not that important, compared to other things they could be doing. Most of this is being very <i>intentional</i> about letting security be a low priority. For instance, the kernel folks have very good reasons for not having a stable kernel API or ABI, because they don&#x27;t want people using out-of-tree code, in pursuit of certain engineering goals. They understand there&#x27;s a tradeoff between that and other engineering goals, like getting more users to run a current release, and they&#x27;re fine with that.<p>(Whether it&#x27;s a valid philosophy to choose to <i>use</i> such a project for secure systems is a different question, but this is just about their internal development philosophy.)<p>Firefox, on the other hand, is a project that very much wants people to be on the latest release all the time, and favoring security is one of the inputs to them in making that tradeoff. Firefox is a project where they <i>can</i> go from announcing that they&#x27;ve found a security bug to the patch being deployed on most users&#x27; machines within hours, and they&#x27;ve optimized for making that be the case. At that point they <i>can</i> handle security bugs differently from normal bugs, and expect that to be a net positive for users. They do have problems about stability of internal APIs (used by add-ons), but they&#x27;re much more cautious about it, and there&#x27;s no viable business in &quot;You&#x27;ll probably get security fixes in a timely fashion, but your add-ons will definitely still work&quot;. Firefox cares about architecting things to be secure by design, and they run their own enterprise release channel with the intention that even conservative deployments will use the binaries from that channel directly.",1441401276

Cut the military industrial spending in half ( US would still have a bigger mildick than anyone else ) and presto, we&#x27;re living in a star trek future.<p>I&#x27;m occasionally asked where the money would come from, but it&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t already just print it anyways. Although a gov. sponsored blockchain type distribution of the universal minimum income would be kinda neat.",1441400478

So applying these results to the real world often doesn&#x27;t work out.<p>As the Wikipedia article points out, although the expected value of the game is infinite if the casino has infinite money, it&#x27;s not only finite but quite small if the casino has finite money. Even if the casino were backed by the entire world GDP, the expected value of the game is only around $50.<p>This to me is a satisfying resolution to the problem presented.",1441400447

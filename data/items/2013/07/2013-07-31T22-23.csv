6137379,comment,6137126,6137126,6,0,dlitwak,,,"I think this is a very naive and somewhat wishful thinking writeup. You neglect a major reason why Rockefeller was able to obtain a monopoly: he controlled literally every part of the process of extracting oil, from the wells to the pipeline to the tank cars, in an industry that had high startup costs/barriers to entry.<p>You basically look at every way in which Uber is doing a great job and then declare they will have a monopoly. It&#x27;s not like they are the first successful business that is killing it and you don&#x27;t have any truly remarkable arguments for why no one else can go do EXACTLY what they are doing. They have a head start: big whoop, so has any great company.<p>For Uber to obtain Standard Oil style monopoly they&#x27;d have to do something very different that you don&#x27;t mention: buy a good portion of the cabs and cars and black car services in the world. In the end those cars are the actual supply, and Uber DOES NOT OWN ONE CAR. Do you know how many of those companies exist? Do you think that 1) Uber is even interested in acquiring them and 2) that&#x27;d even be possible if they did? Do you think that every single one of them would come onto one platform and that Uber could convince them to be that one platform? You don&#x27;t think that in certain regions or countries other companies, the Lyfts and Sidecars and Hailos of the world, won&#x27;t make a move and lock down certain markets first and become the defacto option in those cities?<p>You also neglect the fact that in many cities (downtown new york?) getting a cab is super easy. In some cities there aren&#x27;t enough uber cabs going around at any one time to have an on demand app work necessarily, and for other trips private transportation in the way Uber offers might be exorbitantly expensive (getting to certain airports, etc.). You neglect the fact that they are targeting one behavior, a massive one, but still one behavior: the on demand ride. Lots of people like to plan their rides in advance.<p>Overall this reads like it was written by a fanboy, little real analysis of why, despite the fact that Uber is an awesome company that is doing extremely well, they have any real chance of having a monopoly.<p>It is a transportation planning and booking app. Orbitz, Expedia, Kayak, Hipmunk, you name it are all in the transportation planning space (but for flying) and everyone has their preferences etc. There is room for more than just Uber and the idea that they will just take over everyone is ridiculous.",1375311468

6137363,comment,6127648,6136847,1,0,forgotAgain,,,"It&#x27;s a very interesting read. A couple of points.<p>1) The discussion on reasonable sentencing <i>Some have argued that criminal prosecution was inappropriate ...</i> did not mention that MIT, as well as JSTOR, did not want a jail sentence imposed. The recent MIT report states that MIT made this known to the prosecutor. That MIT suffered loss was a major reason given to justify jail time. The writer can be excused for not knowing that, at the time, confidential information but it makes moot his arguement of jail time being reasonable.<p>2) Pointing fingers at media outlets for exaggerating possible jail time is a non-sequitur when, as stated in the link, prosecutor PR releases purposefully seek the exaggeration.<p>3) No where in the link is it argued that the prosecution took long jail time off the table. Quite the opposite, they left the possibility there on the edges to bully the defendant into accepting a plea that included jail time. This even when JSTOR and MIT both wanted to avoid it.<p>4) Generally speaking I found the link was predisposed to favor the prosecutors. I say that because in all cases where Aaron Swartz&#x27;s actions are discussed there is the assumption that his actions were part of a larger pattern of behavior. To me it smacked of justifying prosecutorial overreach based on &quot;future-crimes&quot;. On the other hand it easily accepts overreaching prosecutorial actions as just the way the system works.<p>5) The link, I thought, worked hard to dismiss outrage over the Swartz case by saying it was misplaced. The outrage, it was argued, should instead be at the system. While it is obvious that it is the laws that must be changed, it is instances like the Swartz case that moves public opinion snd enables change.",1375311303

It wasn&#x27;t so much that a breaking feature change required rewriting code as it was that a single failure propagated. One component written in Scala on which my project depended was upgraded to 2.10, and a backwards-incompatible change in case classes broke the ability to serialize/deserialize objects between my project and the other component.<p>Upgrading my project to 2.10, several of the dependencies no longer compiled. I don&#x27;t remember which ones specifically, but I believe one of them was a JSON library. We had to find libraries that fulfilled the same roles, then rewrite the code that used those libraries against the new APIs. It wasn&#x27;t horrible in the sense of there being a nasty, hard-to-detect runtime bug, rather that it required basically redoing all of the &quot;glue code&quot; with respect to libraries.<p>This wasn&#x27;t painful enough to scare me away from Scala in the future, though it does make me leery of using Scala libraries from anything but top-tier vendors. That is, I&#x27;d use a library from Twitter, FourSquare, TypeSafe, Akka, etc. but never again from anything not widely known.",1375311294

6137320,comment,6134075,6136920,12,0,munificent,,,"> A function should have one entry point and one exit point; that&#x27;s the whole point of structured programming.<p>I think a reasonable primary source for &quot;the whole point of structured programming&quot; is Dijkstra&#x27;s &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful&quot;[1]. It&#x27;s a short article and once you get past his writing style, his point is simple and lucid.<p>In the first part he lays out a simple question: given a program text, how much information do you need to track of to correctly identify where the program is currently executing at some point in time and how it got there? Roughly, if you were paused in the debugger, how much state does the debugger have to hold in order to be able to resume where it left off?<p>He&#x27;s asking this because the smaller amount of state required for this, the easier it is for a human to look at a program <i>text</i> and figure out what can happen while it&#x27;s running <i>dynamically</i>.<p>If all your language had was assignment statements, it&#x27;s simple: you basically just need a single line number. Adding &quot;if&quot; and &quot;switch&quot; for branching doesn&#x27;t add any more complexity. And, of course, reading code like this is pretty trivial.<p>If you have procedure calls (and by implication, recursion), you need a stack of those numbers, which is exactly what the callstack in your debugger holds.<p>When you add &quot;while&quot; and &quot;for&quot; for looping, you need to keep track of how times you&#x27;ve gone around the loop.<p>Now, if you add &quot;go to&quot; everything goes to hell. If you&#x27;re on line 10, did you get there because you were on line 9 before, or because you jumped to it, or some random combination of those? It&#x27;s a total mess.<p>Then he says:<p>> I do not claim that the clauses mentioned are exhaustive in the sense that they will satisfy all needs, but whatever clauses are suggested (e.g. abortion clauses) they should satisfy the requirement that a programmer independent coordinate system can be maintained to describe the process in a helpful and manageable way.<p>Here he&#x27;s saying you can add any other &quot;clauses&quot; (flow control constructs) to a language that you want as long as you don&#x27;t add to the amount of state you need to store to keep track of how you got there.<p>For example, adding an &quot;unless&quot; statement that works like &quot;if&quot; but only has an &quot;else&quot; clause instead of a &quot;then&quot; clause is peachy. You don&#x27;t need any additional data to keep track of where you are.<p>You know what else doesn&#x27;t require adding any additional data? Early returns.<p>So as far as Dijkstra is concerned, no, avoiding early returns is <i>not at all</i> the point of structured programming.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_T...</a>",1375310823

(iPhone 5 == 1GB, GS3/N4/One == 2GB.)<p>Under manual memory management or refcounting, running with RAM 90% full isn&#x27;t slower than 50% full. (Your app code isn&#x27;t slower, at least; who knows it if has effects via OS having less for cache or whatever.) But under GC, if 90% of RAM is full of live objects, you&#x27;ll be forced to GC several times as often as you would if only 50% of RAM were full. So that 1GB->2GB bump might actually _more_ than halve how often you have to collect.<p>There could be other reasons for the diff--maybe part of it is Android&#x27;s more permissive multitasking model, maybe non-GC-related memory-use differences between Android/Java and iOS/ObjC, maybe greater focus on power consumption from Apple or greater focus on specs from Android handset makers.",1375310773

6137219,comment,6134075,6136973,1,0,Someone,,,"I would prefer to see something like (probably not legal Go, but would work in C, if err is of type bool):<p><pre><code>   err = Write(int32(len(g.Name)))
   err |= Write([]byte(g.Name))
   err |= Write(g.Age)
   err |= Write(g.FurColor)
   return err;
</code></pre>
If err is of type int with 0 == noError, this will require some new syntax if you want to return the correct error code (which you should want to do). I would suggest introducing<p><pre><code>   x ||= y    <===>    x = x || y
</code></pre>
In English: if x (still) equals its default, evaluate y and assign the result to x&quot;<p>One could even shortcut this to<p><pre><code>   err = Write(int32(len(g.Name)))
         || Write([]byte(g.Name))
         || Write(g.Age)
         || Write(g.FurColor)
   return err;
</code></pre>
Advantage: that&#x27;s how the shell works, too. Disadvantage is that &#x27;logical or&#x27; is not what one associates with &quot;run items until first failure&quot;, but that can be learned.<p>An alternative could be to have a language construct that takes a sequence of lambda&#x27;s, executes them in sequence until the first one that fails (if any) and returns the index and the result code of the failing lambda. That would get you something like:<p><pre><code>   index,err = SEQ([
           Write(int32(len(g.Name)))
           , Write([]byte(g.Name))
           , Write(g.Age)

6137155,comment,6134075,6136316,5,0,rybosome,,,"This is why I love pattern matching in languages that support it - typing is just one of the things on which they can switch. As the Scala website puts it (paraphrasing), &quot;Pattern matching is switch on steroids!&quot;<p>Here is how you would return all leaf values in a binary tree in Scala:<p><pre><code>    case class Node
    case class Fork(left: Node, right: Node) extends Node
    case class Leaf(value: Int) extends Node

    def getValues(node: Node): List[Int] = node match {
    	    case f: Fork => getValues(f.left) ++ getValues(f.right)
	    case l: Leaf => List(l.value)
    }
</code></pre>
EDIT: Would actually be more idiomatic in Scala to extract the values from the case classes rather than just matching on type...yet another wonderful feature of pattern matching. Coded as follows:<p><pre><code>    def getValues(node: Node): List[Int] = node match {
	    case Fork(left, right) => getValues(left) ++ getValues(right)
	    case Leaf(value) => List(value)

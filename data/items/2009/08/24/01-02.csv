There's a lot more at issue than ""how much money do we need to spend"".  Hell, there's even significant doubt about the question of whether what is currently occurring is inconsistent with natural cyclic trends, and many temperature sampling sites have been found to be compromised by virtue of placement in the middle of parking lots and the like.<p>Get me some figures that don't look like they were compiled by twelve year olds, then we'll talk.",1251078790
781350,comment,781182,781182,0,0,mkramlich,,,"It's semi-satire, but a lot of it rings true, based on my experience working in several big corporate office/cubicle types of jobs. In that environment, people who work smart/fast generally are not rewarded proportionately to their merit. Whereas if you go freelance/contract or start your own business it does become more about effectiveness, efficiency and working ""smarter, not harder"". What you do, not where you do it. What you achieved, not how many hours you clocked. Social networking and relationships are still important, but it's more horizontal and collaborative rather than vertical up/down and master/slave. Also when working in the corp/office/cubicle/9-to-6 sort of job a fairly narrow slice of your talent is used, whereas it's more broad and I think satisfying and challenging intellectually if you're self-employed or freelance. Again, just a generalization based on experience in both worlds, and there are exceptions.",1251078788

781331,comment,781212,781292,0,0,apotheon,,,"Maybe it's just curiosity.<p>I've discovered I can downmod some comments (though I haven't yet), and not others.  That gets me thinking about things like ""What are the rules?  At what point do I get the ability to downmod articles?  Is it all relative to the karma other users have?""<p>. . . but it's just idle curiosity (for me, at least).  The only time I've honestly, earnestly wished I had the power to downmod submissions was when the front page was full of the most banal possible Erlang articles, to the point that even good Erlang articles couldn't get to the front page.  The rest of the time, the fact I lack the ability to downmod submissions just makes the place feel a lot more laid-back than other places, even while the fact I know the HN members with the most activity over the longest time can downmod submissions makes me feel better about the ability of the community to police itself than places that only allow upvotes for <i>everyone</i>.<p>I think, if I were to implement something like this, I'd probably try grading on the curve.  Maybe the tenth percentile would be able to downmod comments, and the second percentile would be able to downmod submissions -- or vice versa.  Maybe I'd make comment downmodding a privilege based on relative karma, and submission downmodding a percentil cut-off.  I'm not sure.  I'd want something that grew organically with the community, though, rather than eventually being 98% of the community because most people have been there long enough to have 200 points and the remainder are newbies and lurkers.<p>edit: That ended up being much longer than I expected (thanks to rambling off into speculation about what I'd do with a new discussion Webapp).",1251077931

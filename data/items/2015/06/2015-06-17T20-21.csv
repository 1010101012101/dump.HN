The more you do it, the more you train your subconscious to intuitively know what to do.<p>As an engineer and tutor it only applies in a limited way. I have taught people who want to learn programming but lack all sorts of fundamentals. What they need to do is just go back to basics - read a book - do the exercises. I find that as an adult learner missing the basic background on things just makes everything hard. You will need to ask questions every step of the way. Who will be on hand to answer those questions? People like me, who have sat down and studied the basics and learned from first principles, i.e. worked through the books.<p>Coding is like math. Both practice and theory are important. If you don&#x27;t read the chapter first and try to jump right into the exercises, you will not be able to do them properly. If you read the chapter but do not do the exercises, then you will forget everything you&#x27;ve read.",1434574788
9735269,comment,9731330,9735069,0,0,sirclueless,,,"I don&#x27;t think these things are all that different, in the very early stages.<p>The very first part of computational thinking is understanding that you can make a very specific and precise procedure to accomplish a task. If a student is at an age where reading and writing is easy, then learning the syntax of a language is a fine way to accomplish this. The student will spend a lot of time with each finicky word and symbol to make the computer behave, and while they may not recognize that they are defining an abstract procedure, the result is hopefully some intuition that the computer is a very predictable and reliable machine that does exactly what the code says, even if it&#x27;s not what you meant. With exposure to more languages and by writing more programs, hopefully a student begins to recognize patterns and abstractions in their code, and that&#x27;s the point at which they become real computational thinkers.<p>If a student isn&#x27;t ready for that, there are still fun things to try. One cute one I&#x27;ve seen is &quot;program your parent&quot; exercise at a workshop. The child can make their parent move one step forwards or back, turn left or right, pick up and put down an object, and put one thing inside another. Can they make their parent pour a glass of juice? Or put a lego back in the box?<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a chicken and egg problem here, because learning to make a dumb machine perform a task by following a procedure is the essence of computational thinking. Learning the basic syntax of a language is probably the most efficacious way to experience this for many students of many ages, even if the explicit goal is &quot;do well on an AP test&quot; or something mundane.",1434574781
9735268,comment,9734073,9735196,0,0,nradov,,,"Commercial diving operations have used hydrogen mixes on an experimental basis for extremely deep dives. This was done mainly to reduce the work of breathing, not to save helium. At extreme depths of like 400m even helium gas gets thick and hard to breathe, whereas hydrogen is a little less dense. Nowadays most work at 400m+ is done by ROVs instead of human divers due to cost and safety.<p>For sport diving in the 30 – 120m range using hydrogen mixes would be ridiculously dangerous due to the fire risk. What happens if your tank leaks on the dive boat next to an engine? No sane dive shop owner or boat captain would ever allow it.",1434574774

That seems like... well, let&#x27;s at least call it not a mainstream opinion.<p>> The universe exists apart from being evoked by the human imagination, while mathematical objects do not exist before and apart from being evoked by human imagination.<p>Smolin says this in his conclusion.  But when people talk about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics (at least when I&#x27;ve heard it), <i>this</i> is what they&#x27;re talking about - not that mathematical objects exist in some nonphysical platonic space, but that they exist <i>in our heads</i> as a game we play - a formal axiomatic system.  The question is, why does our formal game, which we think is mostly abstract, suddenly and surprisingly turn out to work so well to model the physical universe?  (We don&#x27;t find that chess works as a model, for example.)<p>Smolin answers that, sort of.  He says that since the basics of mathematics are in nature, it&#x27;s reasonable that as math progresses, it will continue to correspond to nature.  But it seems to me quite a stretch to say that, because the natural numbers correspond to the existence of countable things in nature, and natural objects take up space, therefore pseudo-Riemannian manifolds will correspond to general relativity.  To say that is reasonable, it seems to me, requires making a mysticism around nature.",1434574600

It&#x27;s pretty much the best medium to make a neutron detector out of because it has an enormous probability to capture a neutron. Neutron detectors are rather important for many reasons, but mostly because they&#x27;re the best way to detect nuclear weapons.<p>He-3 is rather rare naturally and was only really produced in quantity as a byproduct of nuclear weapons fabrication. Basically nobody is making nuclear weapons these days (at least in significant quantities) and there&#x27;s not really any viable source of He-3. Alternative detector media like BF3 is crappy by comparison and the only other way to make He-3 en masse is via fusion, which isn&#x27;t yet feasible.<p>So nowadays a tube full of He-3 about the size of a typical fluorescent light can run into the $100000 range (ish, it&#x27;s so rare that it isn&#x27;t really sold by anybody).",1434574553

They&#x27;re an extension of Green Revolution agriculture ideas. The core of Green Revolution is a focus on cash crops rather than subsistence farming - high intensity monocropping to create raw feedstock for junk food factories in the global market, rather than immediately edible food for local consumption. You don&#x27;t eat soybeans. You eat things made in a factory out of soybeans.<p>Green Revolution is often the cause of rather than cure for hunger in the developing world. Here&#x27;s an example. Ethiopia is one of the most agriculturally bountiful places on Earth. For thousands of years, it has been farmed effectively, and nomadic cattle herding was a key part of that. In the 1970s, it joined the Green Revolution. River valley land was &quot;bought&quot; and fenced in for industrial cattle farming, raising low quality beef for the European pet food market. This cut off access to the rivers during dry season for the nomadic herders, backed up in force by a now internationally funded army. The nomads were forced to stay in the hills, overgrazing during the dry season. A decade or so later, and the hill country desertified and the rivers silted up, ruining both the nomadic and Green Revolution cattle farming. Suddenly, a peaceful and well-fed land became the scene of a world-shaking famine and civil war.<p>The picture is much, much bigger than just GMO.",1434574531

9735102,comment,9733841,9734951,0,0,JoshGlazebrook,,,"They have been cracking down on unlimited data customers over the last year or so. For about 3 months last year after the iPhone 6 was released, there was a bug on Apple&#x27;s website that allowed anyone with an existing unlimited data plan or old nationwide style tiered family plan to add on a new line to that plan with unlimited data. People were using this bug to max out their family plans with new unlimited data lines (while also getting subsidized priced iPhones), and promptly selling or even giving away the unlimited data lines to other people on eBay, HowardForums, Reddit etc.<p>This was done via a process called Assumption of Liability (AOL) where you transfer billing and contract responsibility to another person for that line. Up until November 13th, 2014 the unlimited data plan would be retained during one of these transfers so someone who was not already a Verizon customer, or was a customer but didn&#x27;t have an unlimited data line could obtain one easily. The people abusing the bug on Apple&#x27;s website would rinse and repeat using this process while simultaneously selling their brand new iPhones they just bought for $199 for $600+ and because people wanted unlimited data lines, they could hand those lines under contract away for someone else to deal with (a lot of profit with this whole scheme).<p>Now however unless you already have an unlimited data plan, there is no way to obtain one. There are people on eBay who rent you a line on their family plan for an amount of money per month but you have to put your trust in them to not screw you over. I have read rumors of an unlimited data AOL working if it&#x27;s being transferred to an account that already has a line with unlimited data but that doesn&#x27;t help if you don&#x27;t already have one and want one.<p>Verizon also does not allow you to directly use your unlimited data line&#x27;s 2 year upgrade on your unlimited data line. There are ways around this where you can use make use of your &quot;upgrade&quot; and obtain an device at subsidized pricing and still keep your unlimited line. The easiest situation would be if you have a family plan with an unlimited data line, and a tiered data line. If the tiered data line has an upgrade available you can upgrade that line directly and then swap your unlimited data line sim card into the new phone. If the tiered line is already under contract, the Verizon iconic portal (easily found on google), allows you to transfer your upgrade from your unlimited line to your tiered data line, and proceed with ordering a phone. This will use the upgrade from your unlimited line and extend its contract by two years, but will NOT make unlimited data fall off your line. Once the phone arrives, you simply swap your sim card from your old phone on the unlimited line into the new phone and it works without issue.<p>The last method is called the &quot;best buy method&quot;. There is a long thread on slickdeals about this, but the gist of it is this. You order a new phone from bestbuy.com using your unlimited line&#x27;s upgrade directly on itself. The best buy website will warn you that you will lose unlimited if you continue, and will have you proceed to choose a tiered data plan ($30/2GB).  When the phone arrive do NOT turn it on. Take the sim card that comes inside the phone out and destroy it. Then all you need to do is put your old sim card into the new phone and you have a new phone with your unlimited data plan. This method works because third party companies do not have direct access to Verizon&#x27;s system, and the activation of the sim cards they send out is what completes the process of telling Verizon that you have used your upgrade and chosen a new data plan. If the sim card is never used with that new device that plan change never happens.",1434573501

If they&#x27;s immutable, I look up how to create a copy instead of a reference when using substring and when they&#x27;re not bytearrays I look up how real bytearrays are called in this language.<p>Should early programmers be taught this? Absolutely. At what stage? I don&#x27;t know.

On the other side of the street behind a wall was a huge open space with hundreds, maybe thousands of tons of rice, bought by speculators hoping for rising prices but they didn&#x27;t. Hell, even if everything worked as expected, less supply because everything got bought up causing rising prices in turn, this would be plain unethical extortion.<p>One other example that comes to mind is milk producers in Africa going out of business because of cheap subsidized milk powder flooding the markets. Cheap milk in exchange for now unemployed milk producers and capital leaving the country seems not such a great deal to me. And because of credits from the world bank they are not allowed to counter this development with import taxes.

It&#x27;s educational. You learn things you may never read about in tutorials or books. And it&#x27;s great because the author may have never intended for their code to be studied. But whether they like it or not, other people will learn from their code, and perhaps come up with [occasionally] better versions of it on their own.<p>This has helped the web development to evolve faster, and it&#x27;s obvious how democratizing this &quot;open-by-design&quot; property is, and I think we should be concerned that it&#x27;s being traded away for another (also essential) property.<p>Human beings cannot read asm.js code.

It&#x27;s like Go except even more screwy.<p>edit: in an other subthread you mention following dynamically typed languages, if we go with that and assume no type support it makes slightly more sense, but the logic is still screwy: assuming the second snippet is a function which doesn&#x27;t have a result (so it can only have an error) it should use the same system as the third snippet, the faulting assignment (first snippet) is the one which should use a different syntax.<p>And then there&#x27;a the question of what semantics you get when not assigning but just nesting expressions.<p>An option might be to attach the decision to the call instead (kinda like Swift) e.g. the result of a regular function call would be either `error` or `result, error` (with the language enforcing that one of result and error must be nil) but by &quot;banging&quot; the function the error is raised instead of returned. So you&#x27;d get something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    # no result, possibly an error
    err = foo()
    # a result or an error
    result, err = foo()
    # no result, panics in case of error
    !foo()
    # a result or panics in case of error
    result = !foo()
</code></pre>
the language would enforce that either the error fetched or the function is bang-ed, so<p><pre><code>    foo()
</code></pre>
would be illegal, because it neither receives the error nor raises on error.<p>Not sure that&#x27;s great, but it might be workable.",1434571680

I&#x27;ve been using Macs for as long as I can remember (I&#x27;m 30), and in that entire time, I&#x27;ve only ever actually seen 2 pieces of malware myself (I&#x27;ve heard of others but never actually encountered them). One of them was the rather benign Merry Xmas Hypercard trojan from way back, which doesn&#x27;t actually harm your computer, all it does is search for other hypercard stacks on your computer to infect, and if you open an infected stack on December 25th it will play sound and wish you a Merry Xmas. The other one was one of those Adware apps, I forget its precise name, and I didn&#x27;t actually even see that, I talked with someone else on the phone who had it and walked them through the instructions at <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203987"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203987</a> for removing it.<p>And just to note, the latter one isn&#x27;t even a virus, because it&#x27;s not self-replicating (the former one technically is, because it infects other stacks on the same computer, but it was pretty darn benign and did not rely on an OS security flaw to operate).<p>So yeah, there exists malware for the Mac, and there&#x27;s more of it now than there ever has been in the past, but it&#x27;s like a completely different universe from Windows malware. You pretty much have to go out of your way to hit this on the Mac.<p>As an aside, the first widely-spread Mac malware I ever heard of was spread via a pirated copy of iWork &#x27;09 being distributed on BitTorrent. Someone had altered the DMG to include the virus before uploading it. It was kind of funny hearing about people being infected because you knew the only way they could have done that was by trying to pirate iWork &#x27;09 (this was the only distribution vector). And even that apparently doesn&#x27;t count as a &quot;major&quot; security threat because the Wikipedia page[1] for Mac Defender, which is dated to May 2011, describes Mac Defender as &quot;the first major malware threat to the Macintosh platform&quot;, even though it wasn&#x27;t even a virus it was just a trojan (and FWIW it didn&#x27;t even require antivirus software to remove, Apple rolled out an automatic fix themselves, although it did take them a few weeks to do so).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Defender"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Defender</a>",1434571310

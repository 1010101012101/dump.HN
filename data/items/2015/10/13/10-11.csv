10379560,comment,10379308,10379534,0,0,patio11,,,"The specifics of the tax treaties depend on the country, but in general it works out to avoid double taxation.  If you live in a part of the world where income taxes are generally at higher rates than the US, such as most first-world countries, you get a dollar-for-dollar tax credit against your US taxes for foreign taxes paid, which generally extinguishes your US liability.  (There exist other options, notably the Foreign Earned Income Exemption, for folks earning below ~$100k a year.)<p>The folks with a trickier situation are the ones who either a) are getting subpar tax advice (really, really easy, since few accountants are qualified to talk about multinational taxation and those that are generally charge a bundle) or b) folks who live/work in a low-taxes-low-services nation but end up getting a mid-taxes-no-services bill tacked on due to their US citizenship.<p>Representative examples of the two regimes: I have lived and worked in Japan for the last ten years.  Japanese tax <i>rates</i> are generally on par with or slightly above US tax <i>rates</i>.  (There exist important qualifiers on this for practical tax planning for small businesses here.)  This results in me every year shipping my accountant a lot of numbers after which he comes up with a calculation which says something like: &quot;Taxes owed to US: $20k; taxes accrued in Japan: $22k; take Japan/US tax treaty credit; net tax owed to US $0.&quot;<p>On the other hand, consider a high-salary employee of a bank&#x27;s Hong Kong office.  The HK top tax rate is 15%.  The US top tax rate is 39.6%.  Uncle Sam will <i>happily</i> advise you that you have to pay the 24.6% difference (on your last marginal dollar, naturally).<p>All of the above assumes one is doing one&#x27;s level best to pay the lowest tax bill consistent with the clear intent and established practice of the enforcement divisions of the laws of the United States.  This, regretfully, does not describe all taxpayers.",1444733888

If you make less than about $100,000 per year, you exclude that income from US taxes completely. You still have to file a 1040, but you just declare the income on one line and negate it five lines later. You send the IRS the completed form showing you owe $0 and you&#x27;re done.<p>And if you make more than $100,000 but live in a country that isn&#x27;t a tax-haven, you exclude that income too because you&#x27;re only taxed on the difference between the taxes you would owe the US government and the taxes you paid in your home country. In Europe at least, you&#x27;re almost always taxed at a higher rate than the US would have taxed you, so again, you don&#x27;t owe anything. You&#x27;re only looking at that 30% burden if you live in a country with no taxes and you make millions of dollars (because again, the first $100k is excluded).<p>I agree it&#x27;s a bit crazy that the US taxes worldwide income, but the practical consequences seem pretty minimal. My bank has no problem with me as a customer, or at least if they do, they haven&#x27;t said anything to me about it.",1444733873

Perhaps your facts aren&#x27;t quite up to date (by, say, 5 years or so)<p>First: memory. A consumer GPU these days has 3 GiB of memory and a compute/viz GPU has up to 12 GiB. The memory bandwidth is about 300 GiB/s compared to 50 GiB per second for the CPU-DRAM. In other words: in memory intensive applications, the GPU wins. There&#x27;s no &quot;local memory&quot; in modern GPU architectures (unlike 5 or so years ago), they have L1/L2 caches not unlike the CPU.<p>> For all network and disk access it needs to communicate with the CPU, and again, this communication is slow.<p>This is certainly true that the GPU can&#x27;t do i/o, but &quot;slow&quot; is an ambiguous term. Yes, it is high latency and difficult to orchestrate effectively but the memory bandwidth of a PCI-e bus is 16 GiB/s (v3.x) to 32 GiB/s (v4.x), that&#x27;s 30-60% of the bandwidth between the CPU and DRAM.<p>GPUs can handle complex in-memory data structures, and are very effective in processing e.g. tree structures. There&#x27;s even been applications of GPUs to databases (the PG-storm backend for postgres, for example).<p>Modern GPUs are entirely different beasts to what the matrix and vector batch processing chips were a few years ago were.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s a big shift in paradigms and requires some hard software engineering but the benefits are there. Case in point: the &quot;deep learning revolution&quot;, in particular training the networks, would not have happened were it not for GPU tech.",1444731061

Some are a bit unhappy with the names too, even though they really make sense from the category theory sense.<p>A thing about Foldable is that you can fold over it (obviously) but you can&#x27;t necessarily map over it because in Haskell the general map (fmap of the Functor typeclass) has the law that `map (f1.f2) enum == ((map f1) . (map f2)) enum` but for example for Set this law won&#x27;t hold because the intermediate set might drop elements identical elements that would not have been identical would the f1.f2 been applied in direct succession. See [0] for an example. Why fmap has this law I don&#x27;t know, but Functor is super fundamental in Haskell&#x27;s types so you can bet it&#x27;s there for a good reason.<p>Note that this Foldable-Traversable-Functor introduction into Prelude is not complete yet. For example the map in prelude is: `map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]`. If this movement continues it will possibly be `map :: (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b`. People are super scared of the name Functor, so I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not been adopted yet. It should possibly be renamed to Container or Mappable to be more in line with what general developers expect.<p>Would prelude&#x27;s map be made equal to fmap however, it would make prelude super powerful. It would suddenly work on <i>any</i> Functor type, not just List.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/chad/snippets/random-code-snippets/set-is-not-a-functor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/chad/snippets/random-code-sn...</a><p>p.s.: if you don&#x27;t grok typeclass, call it classclass instead, i.e. class of classes.

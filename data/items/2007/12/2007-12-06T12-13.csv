Something that they could run on top of VMware or Xen.  <p>Or, perhaps a they could sell a pre-configured server.  But, then they're supporting the OS that they're selling, and they might not have the flavor of *nix that the company wants. ",1196945539
86592,comment,86506,86506,0,0,JohnN,,,"An interesting question here, is whether China can convert to a service economy, which is much more information based. If they can develop a big enough internal market with high levels of consumer demand (the Chinese are savers unlike the west) then I cant see why they wont be able to rival the west in the service business.<p>In which case we are all stuffed, lets learn mandarin and move to Shanghai.",1196945421

As a contractor... that's a different story.<p>| This should be better now...<p>It is.  I eventually found a script that automated the whole process for me.

But homework requirements and ""the smart way"" don't really coincide often.<p>|  have never heard of the java.policy files - you chose the wrong path and I would recommend you backtrack and relax. It actually is very easy...<p>.java.policy is essentially setting applet permissions.  It wasn't that bad, it just was the straw that broke the camels back.<p>",1196944723

86587,comment,86365,86365,0,0,Tichy,,,"The language statistics are interesting: big lead for C/C++. I wonder if those are students forced to use C/C++ by their university, or if C/C++ is really still that popular. ",1196944487

Now that it's free software, it's all going to be a simple apt-get away, if not part of the default distro installations. Naturally, Microsoft and Sun still won't co-operate.",1196943525
86582,comment,86551,86551,0,0,shogunmike,,,"It's a shame that so many people will not attempt to follow on with their ""dream job"" goals.<p>At my UK University there is a strong culture of getting a good degree in a quantitative field, perhaps doing a PhD in a similar (but still quantitative) field and then being plucked out by a large investment bank to work as a ""quantitative analyst"". The salary is good, but I'm sure the work becomes tedious after a while. The process is almost as precise as an automobile assembly line!<p>I wish the culture of entrepreneurialism was stronger than the desire to go and price financial derivatives. After all, two/three hundred years ago nearly everybody was an entrepreneur (farmers). How things have changed...",1196943472

86579,comment,86550,86550,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"While we're ranting about Sun, my university's old-ish (1990s?) big (8 SPARCs, 32GB RAM) SunOS (before Solaris)  time-sharing machine that they have for all the engineering students to do projects on doesn't even have a freakin' Subversion client on it. I spent the better part of an hour trying to compile it before giving up. Shouldn't they be encouraging students to use source control? I guess I take these things for granted.

86576,comment,86550,86550,0,0,Tichy,,,"The big mistake you made is to install J2EE. Just install JDK and Tomcat, and you will be fine. J2EE is weird indeed - it used to be OK, you could download just the things you need, but I guess some Sun managers decided to make it bloatware and abuse their users, so now it is some indescribable blob. I don't even know exactly what it is - just don't install it, don't use, I can only repeat that!<p>You need some J2EE libraries, like the servlet API, but I think you can use the one that comes with Tomcat. <p>Also, I think there is some weird bug in the latest Tomcat versions, so the recommended version at the moment appears to be 5.5.17 (I am still using Java 1.5, though, and not yet Tomcat 6).<p>I have never heard of the java.policy files - you chose the wrong path and I would recommend you backtrack and relax. It actually is very easy...<p>As a sidenote, I found it very hard to set up Rails, too. The automatic thing didn't work (presumably user rights issue), I wasn't sure if I needed a db driver and went looking for one, and so on. I only successfully installed it once I switched my computer to Linux.

86574,comment,86362,86362,0,0,cratuki,,,"I have a macbook. It's solid but I'd avoid it for linux (which I've decided I prefer to osx) - the single-button trackpad alone makes it a bad choice for linux. If I were getting a new laptop now I'd get a high-end thinkpad with lots of RAM so I could use vmware effectively. I have a friend who has just done this and raves about it - he runs Ubuntu.<p>Some people can get X11 configured to do wacky things with the keyboard so you can run linux. I figure - why bother?

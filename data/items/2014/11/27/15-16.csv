But otherwise, yes, much of this is public-domain tech.<p>I&#x27;m on the fence regarding nuclear for at least two main reasons:  safety (particularly the hard-to-quantify-of-guarantee long-term safety), and fuel availability.  The picture on both strikes me as less than clear.  Near term, perhaps useful as a bridge fuel.<p>Geothermal is actually pretty awesome, but much more profoundly limited than most people suspect (tide and wave power are also overestimated -- the San Francisco Bay, for example, represents less total tidal power than the bay region uses in electricity, and only a small fraction of that potential could be extracted).  Enhanced geothermal (basically, injection wells) have proven expensive and low-benefit, see Australia&#x27;s Habanero project and its challenges.<p>Hot, wet-field geo though is proven, and a high-yield resource in Iceland, Japan, the Philippines, Kenya, New Zealand, the US, and a few other regions.  In developing regions (particularly Kenya) it could dramatically increase total electrical generation capacity.<p>Hydro is largely built out and has environmental issues, though it also works quite well.<p>It&#x27;s a sticky problem.",1417103951

You declare those same values for your dependencies. And then it Just Works. When you want to release, you invoke the release plugin, and it will do all the right things. If you want a test coverage analysis, you invoke a suitable plugin (e.g. emma) and it&#x27;ll do the right things. It is, hands down, the best build system I have ever used, in any language.<p>The problem comes because everyone thinks their build is a special snowflake that absolutely <i>needs</i> to replace every instance of the number 15 in their codebase with a heart symbol. No. You don&#x27;t do that. If you&#x27;re doing something standard there will be a plugin for it. If there isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s probably because what you want to do is a very bad idea - do it in code instead. If you absolutely insist, you&#x27;re going to have to write a plugin, which at least means you&#x27;ll follow coding standards, have test coverage, and all the rest of it, rather than just sticking random unreviewed crap into your build like happens in every other build system.",1417103147

Worse than that, the corporation providing it has shown they&#x27;re interested in collecting as much information as possible (e.g. trawling for wireless data with streetview cars). Such centralised information banks give that corporation a lot of power and are vulnerable to retrospective government requests for the data. Google has enough info about me as it is thanks (search, analytics, docs, emails, now video).<p>That&#x27;s completely different to most <i>closed circuit</i> TV cameras which record for a limited time and without great quality, for purposes like security against burglary. Just as I&#x27;d object to having a permanently on internet-connected camera in my home, I&#x27;d also object to someone wearing Google Glass there. Even more objectionable would be hundreds of thousands of google connected video cameras walking the streets. Maybe that makes me unusual, but apparently not given the reception of Glass.<p>The camera was a terrible mistake from my perspective and completely put me off the possibility of owning it, and also puts me off Google the company for condoning such an obvious invasion of the privacy of others without their consent, and people who wear it for being so tone deaf - it would be like walking around with your camera phone permanently switched on pointing at your focus of attention - how weird and creepy. The whole thing reminds me of The Entire History of You or the telescreens in 1984 - I don&#x27;t want to record everything I do, nor do I want others to do so without my consent, just as I don&#x27;t want everything I write on the internet to be retrievable in an instant catalogued against every alias I&#x27;ve ever used. Maybe that will happen one day and there&#x27;s nothing we can do about it, but there are definitely downsides.<p>PS I&#x27;m not perfectly fine with omnipresent CCTV or NSA data collection either; nice straw man.",1417103046

I haven&#x27;t worn a watch on my wrist since...probably elementary school--so the 70&#x27;s.

It&#x27;s taken a lot of patience. And it&#x27;s taken me quite a bit to LET GO of my way of doing things. I had to take my ego out of the picture. (VERY hard to do.)\nNowadays, I realize that developers don&#x27;t have to BE better than me. I simply have to ALLOW them to do what they do without being so obsessive about it. Turns out, even junior developers really CAN do good work. They just need a little guidance that only comes with experience, and then they need me to get out of their way.&quot;<p>Specifically, I would suggest volunteering to teach those who traditionally don&#x27;t get the opportunities to learn coding.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8649415"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8649415</a>",1417102036

Not taking seriously would cause Google infinite problem if they don&#x27;t pull from Europe entirely.<p>It is all the other things that Europe is not taken seriously for. Before the crisis citizen living in Europe had some feeling of being European (see the talk about a social Europe, European constitution, ...). The crisis had made clear that countries in Europe are business partners rather than a &quot;union of countries&quot;, hence the recent push of euro-sceptic parties all over Europe and the call for &quot;preserving country X sovereignty&quot; by traditional parties.<p>The failures of/problem of the EURO currency recently and the weirdo relationship it caused between EURO-zone countries is a confusing point, but in general, from an economic point of view, Europe is quite active and well respected between all the members. ( and do not get confused by the &quot;Brussels made us do it&quot; card politician play in order to apply unpopular decision they nevertheless supported )",1417100912

Part of that is understanding what a &quot;fully burdened&quot; employee costs, it&#x27;s well over what their salary is.<p>Understanding what&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; is tougher. TBH, &quot;normal&quot; is whatever you&#x27;re burning if you aren&#x27;t wasting money.<p>A decent WAG at how much money you need to keep a mid-level employee employed for a year is about $250k, it doesn&#x27;t matter much where, but you might inflate that a bit for SF or NYC, and drop it a bit for Nowhere&#x27;sville, Nebraska. That&#x27;s salary ($100k plus or minus), benefits, office space, administrative overhead, vacation, etc.<p>You&#x27;ll want to earn more than that, on average, per employee per year, to be profitable.<p>It&#x27;s useful in other algebraic ways to get a gauge on other company&#x27;s burn rates, size, or needed revenue.<p>For example, your competitor might advertise that they have 200 employees. That means they operating a $50m/year business to break even. A reasonable target for basic sustainment and growth is $300k/employee/year so they&#x27;d need to be a $60m/year business to be growing.<p>Here&#x27;s some real world examples:<p><pre><code>   Company     - Revenue        - Employees - Average/employee/year\n   Oracle Corp - $38.27b (2014) - 122,458   - $312,515\n   Microsoft   - $86.83b (2014) - 128,076   - $677,956\n   Facebook    - $7.87b  (2013) - 8,348     - $942,740\n   Sony        - $66.12b (2014) - 140,900   - $469,268\n   Google      - $59.83b (2013) - 55,030    - $1.09m\n   Apple       - $182.8b (2014) - 98,000    - $1.87m\n   Radio Shack - $4.473b (2010) - 36,400    - $122,884\n   Amazon      - $74.45b (2013) - 132,600   - $561,463\n   Lockheed    - $45.358 (2013) - 116,000   - $391,017\n   Boeing      - $86.623 (2013) - 168,421   - $514,324\n   Leidos      - $7b (prj 2014) - 22,000    - $318,181\n   SAIC        - $3.8b          - 13,000    - $292,307\n   Tesla       - $2b     (2013) - 10,000    - $200,000\n   Ford        - $147b   (2013) - 181,000   - $812,154\n   Nokia       - $15,85b (2013) - 55,025    - $288,050\n   </code></pre>\nNow look down this list and think about who&#x27;s considered wildly successful and <i>hot</i> and who&#x27;s considered on the way out, in the doldrums or has had recent sell-offs or splits in the company. This isn&#x27;t perfectly scientific, just a guideline.<p>Startups have a slight advantage in that you can sometimes hire employees at a lower salary in exchange for options. This can temporarily deflate the costs and let you beat these guidelines for a while. But ultimately you&#x27;ll run out of paper to give out and you&#x27;ll have to start paying people what they&#x27;re worth.<p>However, Startup founders, especially first timers, are often at a disadvantage because they&#x27;ve never had to handle so much money before. One startup I was at had a changeover in CEOs and an analysis of non-employee expenses under the previous CEO showed a $30k/mo travel expense for him and the CTO.<p>Turns out the previous CEO and CTO were doing all their business traveling for sales in business class. We had been chronically understaffed. The new CEO cut the travel and hired an outside and inside sales-person for about the same and revenue started increasing shortly thereafter. Interoffice communications was turned into weekly phone conferences and communication even improved.<p>Don&#x27;t spend your money in stupid ways and you&#x27;ll have more to put behind the business.",1417100779

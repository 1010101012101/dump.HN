But for use at my home, I buy bottles of ketchup, not sachets.  Given a choice, why would I choose to succumb to waste?<p>It&#x27;s like a company forcing me to use mayo sachets at home, rather than buying a bottle, because it makes them more money.

Problems that had nothing to do with implementation:<p>* CRIME, which conceptually breaks the way TLS wants to handle compression<p>* POET, which is an oracle attack against the way TLS does CBC<p>* BEAST, which exploits IV chaining in the TLS CBC construction<p>* The RC4 flaws break one of the most popular TLS ciphers, which was ill-advisedly included in SSL3/TLS<p>I could probably go on. For instance, the JSSE Bleichenbacher flaw looks like an implementation issue today, but it&#x27;s an implementation that fails to perfectly implement a clumsy countermeasure TLS builds in to Bleichenbacher&#x27;s P1v15 attack which TLS was originally totally susceptible to.<p>These aren&#x27;t &quot;implementation extensions&quot;; this is core functionality.<p>Heartbleed was an implementation flaw.

Maybe this indicates there would be a market for an opinionated TLS embedded library...<p>>On the other hand, static keying has many pitfalls and pretty much requires a mechanism to send updated keys.<p>Static keying issues aren&#x27;t unique to IPsec, they occur with every symmetric cipher. There is nothing stopping you from having a management tool that rotates the static key based on a master key and the day. Or if you want to send updated keys, you just encrypt them and send them over the IPsec connection using GPG or whatever your asymmetric choice is.<p>>Finally, building a secure VPN wire protocol just isn&#x27;t that hard.

Useful in that it provides an entropy source not currently available. But vulnerable in that it could conceivably weakened considerably.<p>Perhaps what should be discussed in this context is not entropy but conditional entropy. Entropy really is relative to one&#x27;s understanding of the underlying system being observed. For example, human height is nearly normally distributed and would provide some degree of entropy if it could be freely sampled from. But for a given person, knowledge of the parents&#x27; heights makes predicting the child&#x27;s height a much easier task. The entropy of height given parents&#x27; heights is less than the entropy of height in general. H(Height|ParentsHeight) < H(Height)<p>In the case of this CPU jitter method, things it calls nondeterministic are, in fact, clearly deterministic---disparities between CPU and memory clockspeed come to mind. Effort at better modeling of the internals of a CPU may lead these &quot;random&quot; events to appear not-so-random-anymore. Suppose I build a statistical model of CPU jitter based on various properties observable from a non-privileged process in the OS. To the extent that my model predicts jitter better than random, an entropy source derived from CPU jitter is weaker. The conditional entropy _given_ the model could decrease substantially, to the point that it&#x27;s no longer a good entropy source.<p>That said, none of that work seems to have been done yet.

They will probe your weak spots and then use this knowledge to publicly disgrace you, declare you less competent than what you&#x27;d like them to believe and then to low-ball you with an offer below what you might otherwise get. Many developers fall for that trick, the best you can do is to make sure you don&#x27;t join their group.<p>Just say to them you will not do a technical interview (or a test project on your own unpaid time) but that you are prepared to meet and have a constructive discussion around their needs and your willingness to possibly help them out with whatever they have in mind.

The alternative is requiring no punctuation and making newlines significant.)<p>Well, I suppose it does look better.<p>However, the idea is of limited applicability. While looking through the example project (<a href=""https://github.com/axch/test-manager"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/axch/test-manager</a>), I had trouble finding some code where this would actually be useful – most code has too much nesting.<p>That’s why I prefer another solution for removing excess parens from Lisp syntax: making whitespace significant. It improves the syntax in cases where your periods would help, and it applies in additional cases as well.<p>“Sweet-expressions” (<a href=""http://readable.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readable.sourceforge.net/</a>) is an implementation of that. Here is the above code ran through the `sweeten` tool to convert it to sweet-expressions:<p><pre><code>    define-record-type\n      omap-entry\n      make-omap-entry key item next prev\n      omap-entry?\n      key omap-entry-key set-omap-entry-key!\n      item omap-entry-item set-omap-entry-item!\n      next omap-entry-next set-omap-entry-next!\n      prev omap-entry-prev set-omap-entry-prev!\n</code></pre>\nAbsolutely no parentheses necessary, while still preserving homoiconicity. You don’t even have to remember the `)` at the end of the last nested line. And I chose this example code to look good with your idea – when the code has more nesting, sweet-expressions look even better.<p>About the interrogative mood `?` you describe: it might simplify `if` statements. But that would require removing the convention where boolean-returning functions have a name ending in `?`, such as `omap-entry?` in the example. It’s a tradeoff.",1431119732

But it looks at logs, so now it needs to mount a shared folder or coordinate sending logs via sockets. Or maybe it is a helper process. Like an indexer.  Putting that in a  separate container with its isolated OS dependencies might not make sense.

I was just as skeptical of the RasPi when I first heard of it.<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the materialization of the RasPi despite their troubles getting production started.<p>That said, I think this is a pipe dream. Its SO easy to hack together a prototype and then look at the volume discounted total of the BOM and think you&#x27;ve got a product. The most common mistake is to give yourself a &quot;generous&quot; 20% profit over the estimated cost of materials when really it should be more like 300% just to be viable.<p>I suspect they&#x27;ll discover soon enough that $20-$30 is a minimum realistic retail sale price for this item.",1431118955

6288409,comment,6288272,6288272,2,0,raverbashing,,,"&quot;We dont work the way we do because tables are a limitation of the technology, we use the relational model because it has sound mathematical underpinnings, and the technology reflects that. Wheres the rigour in MongoDBs model?&quot;<p>It seems all anti-NoSQL rants are the same whining and refusal  to understand. &quot;Sound mathematical base&quot;? Really? So, if I can&#x27;t describe something mathematically (I can, by the way) it&#x27;s not worth it? A computer program is a mathematical description, there you have it.<p>The relational model breaks for very common use cases nowadays. Yes, maybe you think it&#x27;s fun to do a query across how many tables to get the information you want, but if your website has a non-trivial traffic then the solution is usually to add more cache.<p>That&#x27;s (one of the reasons) why PostgreSQL has hstore. Beyond the fanboy insistence that you can do everything with relational DBs, Postgres have accepted the reality that you need a more flexible data structure.<p>Edit: yes, please continue showing your contempt while I have to code around the limitation of relational databases.",1377673163

Receive Sensitivity from the datasheet at 915 MHz is -122 dBm @ 1200 baud, -110 dBm @ 50 kbps, and -97 dBm @ 500 kbps. Very good overall. (all these values are from the datasheet.)<p>Free space ideal path loss at 915 MHz and 1 km is -91.7 dB [2]. This gives an ideal budget of 44 dB. Toss in some antenna gain and you should have plenty to play around with for losses in the passives, connectors, antenna alignment, etc. 3 km is pushing it, with another 10 dB of path loss. So I would think 1 kilometer is easily attainable at 1200 baud with this chip.<p>However, things start to change with FCC compliance... 15.249 devices (a lot less limitations, including fixed frequency) can transmit at max -1 dBm. [3] So the compliant device at 50 kbps, -1 dBm, 1 km has 15 dB ideal budget, right on the edge of working. 500 kbps is probably not going to happen at 1 km except in perfect conditions.<p>So now you want to use hopping as a 15.247 device to get the limit up to 30 dBm/1 Watt. This chip doesn&#x27;t support DSSS, so we are frequency hopping. This limits us to a channel bandwidth of 500 kHz, so you can&#x27;t run at high speeds - maybe 200 kbps or so? Downside is you are spending some time hopping and waiting for PLLs to stabilize, there is a chance for interference on certain frequencies resulting in periodic dropouts until you hop to the next frequency, and the software side/hopping coordination is tons more complex. But you would be able to communicate pretty far!<p>Also, note that RF is very unfriendly and link budgets can easily be used up with obstacles in the way, walls, trees, not to mention pesky humans etc.<p>Hopefully this clarifies some things?

6288338,comment,6287927,6287927,3,0,tubelite,,,"Animations are hardly the worst thing about iOS7. After playing with betas for several weeks on an iPad 2, I, for one, have developed a cordial dislike for our iOS7 overlord.  I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why it feels so bad, and this is my pet theory:<p>In &quot;Thinking, Fast and Slow&quot;, Daniel Kahneman talks of the two modes of thinking as System 1 (automatic, fast, involuntary cognitive processes like face/pattern recognition) and System 2 (conscious, attention-requiring processes like multiplication).<p>&quot;System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification...<p>When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing...&quot;<p>A good principle of usability is to keep both systems humming in the manner described above, reducing &quot;page faults&quot; into System 2 to the minimum.<p>The realism and skeuomorphism of old Apple design (reaching godawfully kitschy heights in leather-stitching and reel-to-reel tape) with the 3-D buttons and shadows had this in their favour: they made it very easy for System 1 to parse the landscape. Navigating an Apple UI felt smooth and intuitive; never effortful.<p>But now, struggling through the anorexic fog of iOS7, I guess they&#x27;ve thrown the baby of usability out with the bathwater of realism. System 1 is often forced to fault into  System 2 to make sense of patches of stark, undifferentiated space, a mess of thin fonts, single-pixel-wide, poor-contrast UI elements. The more attention you have to divert into basic navigation, the less you have to focus on the content. Most system apps (Notes, Mail, Calendar...) suffer from these issues. Plus the eye-wateringly terrible icons and saturated colors (seriously, who came up with the Safari and Game Center icons?) and poor readability of app names. Change the background image from the default of Dark Nebula to one with sand and the readability gets much worse. I waited to see if it was one of those things which you get used to, but no luck.<p>Not everything&#x27;s bad: the layering effects, blur, control and notification panels sliding in from top and bottom are all great improvements from iOS6. But surely it&#x27;s possible to create a UI which is navigable by System 1, which ruffles the minimum of aesthetic feathers with re kitschy realism? IMHO, Mountain Lion has done exactly that: Gradients, shadows and colors have acquired a quiet, subtle elegance which are a far cry from the days of lickable buttons.",1377671714

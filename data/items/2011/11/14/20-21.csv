3235584,comment,3233526,3235408,3,0,dkersten,,,"Ok, so its the case that null is valid data and makes for a bad ""invalid value"".<p>Personally, this demonstrates a core reason why return values (and returning null in particular, in any language) are a bad way of handling errors - they're a leaky abstraction and too much inside knowledge is required to use them safely. For example, if I have code like<p><pre><code>    a = foo()\n    if (a is valid) bar(a)\n</code></pre>\nI have to know about the possible values of <i>a</i> before I can pass it to <i>bar</i>. Exceptions are better because I don't have to know the internal details (<i>foo</i> and <i>bar</i> could be library functions that return some data I don't know all the valid values of):<p><pre><code>    try {\n        a = foo()\n        bar(a)\n    } catch (e) {\n        handle error here\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut I also agree with the post that exceptions aren't always great either.<p>Instead of returning null, I like haskells Maybe. You either return a valid value (which can be null, in this case) or it returning <i>Nothing</i>, which can never be something which is also valid data. This removes the possible ambiguity of whether null is an error value or a valid value and the haskell compiler makes sure you hanbdle the error case, but its still a signal-error-through-return-value method of error handling and is not always ideal. I also like the ideas behind common lisps condition system, though I have never used it in real code. I like the idea of abstracting the error signalling, handling and routing into separate entities that can happen at various parts of the hierarchy. I also like Go's defer/panic/recover mechanism, though, again, I have never used it in real code, so don't know how well it works in reality.",1321302987

After Prussia / Germany completely relaxed IP laws it became the leading industrial nation in Europe. The UK where strong special interest groups pushed through stringent IP & patent law lost it leadership role & dominance of the industry and has till today not been able to recover from that.<p>On patent trolls & the 500 billion: \nThe Private and Social Costs of Patent Trolls (<a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1930272"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1930272</a>)\nAbstract:      \nIn the past, non-practicing entities (NPEs) - firms that license patents without producing goods - have facilitated technology markets and increased rents for small inventors. Is this also true for todays NPEs? Or are they patent trolls who opportunistically litigate over software patents with unpredictable boundaries? Using stock market event studies around patent lawsuit filings, we find that NPE lawsuits are associated with half a trillion dollars of lost wealth to defendants from 1990 through 2010, mostly from technology companies. Moreover, very little of this loss represents a transfer to small inventors. Instead, it implies reduced innovation incentives.",1321302878

I can't decide to make something in the library not-exceptional, though.</i><p>Making something in the library non-exceptional is equivalent to discarding an error.  Catch the exception and discard it.  Done.  Do this at whatever level you feel is appropriate (or don't, and handle the exception in a more reasonable fashion).<p>> <i>In other words, somebody thought it was reasonable to force .NET users to catch some exceptions immediately.</i><p>What do you suppose should be done?  The other option seems to be to continue in a erroneous state.  I'm probably not familiar with every possible error-handling methodology, but it seems the main ones are ""error codes"" (those worked so great in C, right), ""exceptions"" (annoying, but error handling in general is annoying), and ""injected handling"" (where the caller can inject error handling code somehow; but this is more complicated and requires deeper knowledge about the callee).  Is there a better option?<p>> <i>No, but there's not much point in using .NET if I'm not using the library that comes with it. And the design of the library does tie my hands in some cases.</i><p>My point is that you are not tied by .Net any more than you are tied by any other exception-handling language.  You can handle exceptions where and how you feel is appropriate.<p>> <i>I think the author makes a great point about libraries that use exception handling blurring the line between bugs and expected problems. That's exactly how I feel about the C# work I've done.</i><p>I think this is a bit of a red herring.  An exceptional condition is simply a special case.  A bug in the code is an exceptional condition.  A problem parsing a number is an exceptional condition.  Modern languages generally have specific exceptions to allow you to handle different situations with custom logic, but it's important to note that the runtime can't reliably distinguish between ""bugs"" and ""expected problems"".  Did your number parsing fail because the user entered an invalid value or because your code grabbed column 3 instead of 4?",1321301697

The only reason why monopolies are no longer as dominant in the United States and the West is because of the outlawing of monopolistic practices like hoarding or selling products below costs to kill off smaller competitors. Again I don't deny that government involvement sustains monopolies but monopolies are first created by the free market, and then they kill that very free market that brought them to the top. I think we should do away with campaign contributions and go straight with public financing.",1321301067

If you could plan your meals /assisted/ by your fridge and it could tell you that the guy next door has eggs that are free, you wouldn't need to buy a whole carton just because you want to bake a cake, thus possibly reducing waste.<p>In the end, this puts us back to the old privacy implications versus efficiency problem that remains largely unsolved.",1321300843

1879002,comment,1876749,1878023,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Of course ""glorified hedge fund"" is an exaggeration and the UK does have pockets of innovation in industries like biotech. Services is 75% of GDP, 10% of GDP is financial services in the narrowest sense. That's compared to 7.5% in the US and 3.8% in Germany. How much of that huge services sector is linked to financial services? My own observation is that about half of all IT jobs in the UK are related to finance. I think it's fair to say that the value Britain adds to the world economy is dominated by investment banking.<p>There are historical reasons for that, but the extremely lax approach to regulation plays a huge role as well. The UK is where hedge funds and investment banks from all over the world go to do the most daring kinds of gambles. AIG was the biggest insurer in the world. Their small London office bankrupted the entire company. Why was that office in London instead of New York?<p>But my point is that any claim that the UK is leading the world in terms of a new type of knowledge driven, highly automated manufacturing model is completely delusional. It just doesn't exist outside of a few speeches David Cameron gave during the election campaign. Britain is not even on the map when it comes to technology.<p>I don't know if this is a big problem. Maybe the world can sustain a few bloated financial centres and will do so for a long time to come. But if it turns out that finance as a share of world GDP has peaked, then the UK is in a very dire situation, arguably the worst outside if Iceland.",1289117435

It is hard for the stock to go much lower, because the company is always buying.</i><p>This statement shows a common misunderstanding of finance.<p>The market cap of a company represents the market's best estimate of the value of that company.  When a company does a share buy-back, the company loses money and destroys stock.  The current value of the money used matches the value of the stock destroyed, and so the market cap should be reduced by the amount of stock destroyed.  Therefore to first order effects, the result is that the share price should remain constant.  (There are second order effects where some value is transferred from stock holders to option owners, which indicates that the share price should go down.)",1289117054

We (first-world) got a lot of cheap manufacturing inputs because we ignored (i.e. passed on to next generations) some of the costs of energy, namely pollution and water use in coal.  One of the reasons we were able to do that in the 50s and 60s is that we hadn't really convinced ourselves it would be as bad as the environmentalists said, so we ignored it.<p>China won't be able to pass those externalities on to future generations as we did.  The reason is that we serve as an  example of what happens when you do ignore the full cost of energy generation, and there is already significant local concern about pollution from unrestricted manufacturing and energy generation.<p>I think China will not have the luxury that we had of several decades of ignoring some hidden input costs.   They will be forced to implement full environmental impact controls which will drive up energy costs.<p>They do have some dam projects for hydropower generation left to bring online, but I can't see any really major projects being implemented after that.

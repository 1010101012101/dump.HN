Once it is too large, each employed person's output is smaller than what it could be in a smaller company. Which is why a lot of people leave large companies to launch start-ups and why a lot of start-ups that are acquired fail when in a larger and bureaucratic system.",1313618394
2897128,comment,2896710,2897012,27,0,jrockway,,,"The problem with the whiteboard design is that you have to defer, ""oh, let's see if that works"" indefinitely.  While you spend 90% of your time thinking and 10% typing, you don't spend 9 hours thinking and then 1 hour typing.  You spend 5 seconds typing, then 30 seconds thinking, then a minute or so typing, and so on.  Getting feedback from the computer is important for anything that's complicated enough to require a design.  Seeing what the code looks like that your design enables is as important as a conceptually-sound design.<p>The main problem is that 99% of programmers don't know how to prototype.  They assume that whatever they commit is what goes into production.  No.  Try an idea quickly and throw it away if it's bad.  That's why we have languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby.  While it's 50/50 on using them for production, they are absolutely the right tool for testing your ideas quickly.<p>And if you can test ideas quickly, you don't need meetings.  Spend an hour coding what you would have talked about in the meeting.  Share with coworkers.  Get feedback.  Tweak the prototype.  Then write the ""ready for production"" version.<p>I've been to a lot of meetings but I've never seen any piece of code look anything like what was described in the meetings.  As soon as you hit that one point where the computer's view of things and your meeting's view of things diverges, everything else you discussed in the meeting is invalidated.  The computer is always right.<p>(Actually, one of the answers I got to an interview question at Google was so cool that I had to code it.  And the code looked exactly like the design I sketched on the whiteboard.  And it ran really fast on a large dataset.  So maybe meetings are useful; but only for algorithm design, not for ""real-world"" stuff like ""how should we refactor this thing"".)",1313618382

It presented some insightful analysis of dyno/worker efficiency<p>>It could be that Im benchmarking from only 1 server but Ive seen almost no difference between having 40 dynos or 60. Youll see one when you receive the bill so be cautious, especially if you use an auto-scale tool.<p>>The same applies to node with cluster, you can do more with 15 dynos running cluster with 3 workers than with 60 dynos of node alone (for a quarter of the price!).",1313618363

2897124,comment,2887903,2894230,1,0,glenra,,,"> <i>Your citizenship is the explicit signature on the contract.</i><p>A ""citizenship"" is not a tangible thing. I didn't do anything specific to get a ""citizenship"", so how can my allegedly ""having"" one constitute an <i>explicit</i> anything?<p>Do you not see how circular the argument is? Is your claim <i>really</i> that (a) I'm bound to the US legal code because I ""have a citizenship"", and (b) I ""have a citizenship"" because the US legal code says I do? Are you sure you've thought this through?<p>> <i>As long as you are a citizen you are a signatory.</i><p>I'm sorry, but to me the word ""signatory"" implies <i>having signed something</i>. Your claim makes about as much sense as saying ""as long as you have red hair you are a signatory"".<p>> <i>You can remove your name at any time.</i><p>That is not actually true; you can't renounce citizenship without the government's consent which it only grants in limited circumstances. You can't do it while residing in the US and if you have significant assets or income in many cases you need to either keep paying income tax for TEN YEARS after you leave or are required to pay a huge one-time lump sum. The practicality of the situation is a bit like being born a slave and having the (limited) right to purchase your freedom later in life.",1313618289

Induction motor controller, probably not so much :)</i><p>I suspect that it would be possible to map most control problems onto a problem that the human mind can solve, either consciously or instinctively.  I don't think the speed of the loop should be a deciding factor at all, at least when a computer is doing the control.  For example, you could map maintaining power supply stability to standing upright just by slowing the problem down and converting the input variables into axes of motion.<p>To sum up, bumping up the clock speed on something a human could do (even if it took them a thousand years) seems like a very poor criterion for patentability, and I hope the issue is revisited and clarified.",1313618220

I don't think so. I'm running my dev rig on a machine I built in 2008 - quad core Intel Core Duo w/ 8GB RAM on 64-bit Win2k8R2 OS - and it's blazing still today. I'm running VMs, SharePoint, SQL Server all in the background and still it's a great box. Prior to that I was spending $2k every two years probably to keep up.<p>My wife's PC is the same - it's just a regular box we bought at MicroCenter, I think, in 2009. It has an Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD dual core (can't recall). It's super fast. I see no reason to upgrade. She runs Photoshop and MS Office mainly and both are super, super fast.<p>2) The one thing that made the biggest impact for our computers was to make the OS run on SSDs. Prior to doing that, we were both frustrated.<p>So combine (a) whether Moore's Law is applicable today, and (b) SSD performance and availability, and it makes me wonder just how much this will impact not only Dell but other companies (HP, etc).<p>Hell, that makes me wonder: are we spending money on iPads for fun b/c we have extra money that we were going to spend on upgrading computers but now don't have to?

I realize you said that you didn't want to get bogged down in the function itself, but I think it may be important.<p>If we can agree that capital is the means by which a person can achieve fulfillment (I don't just mean by ""being rich"", obviously. It may enable the person to donate to charity; or that person's labor, which which has a monetary value, may achieve some end; or to obtain medical care to cure an ailment; etc.), then I can see an answer.<p>In the free trade example, opening borders to trade expands the economies of both nations. That's pretty much the same as saying that more capital is available within both nations, which means that -- across the whole population -- people are better able to move up their utility function (i.e., achieve self-actualization). In other words, because money -- capital -- has the power to buy or enable other things, then our positions may be compatible.<p>Of course, some individuals may benefit more than others, and indeed, some may find themselves worse off. That's where some would claim that we as a society owe compensation to some, to pay for our own gains.<p>Looking back at what I just wrote, it seems the crux of the argument, then, is the degree to which you can believe that capital can provide the answer to whatever your objective function is.<p>I'm going to reject the example of a market in slavery. This is the very epitome of a <i>non</i> free market. The slaves themselves are being forced into the transaction, and since a free market, by definition, requires rational actors entering the transaction of their own free will (because they all expect to be better off in the end), it cannot be considered free.<p>The classic examples of market failure are ""tragedy of the commons"" problems due to externalized costs, and public goods that would suffer ""free rider"" problems, like national defense. The externalization problems are due to our legal framework for property rights; a system that fully allocates property rights (e.g., some person owns this river; some person owns the air) would fix this, as demonstrated by the Coase Theorem. The free rider problem is stickier. They do turn out to be much rarer than people believe (e.g., the classic example is the lighthouse, but historical research shows that in the past, these <i>have</i> been provided by markets), but they're not entirely fictional, and I don't have a good answer to the overall question at the moment.",1313616884

I sat through 5 other students who had much better grades and were doing the oral examination for the A instead of an A- (I was fighting for a B-)  They weren't doing so well for the most part.  At the end, the professor, who knew I could do it, started going above and beyond what we hard learned into Solid State physics, just to see what I knew.  I screwed up a bit on the paper final, getting stuck on weird problem that involved some hand waving for some radiative losses for an electron near relativistic energies.  I knew I was below the curve.  I went in to say bye to the professor on the last day, and he asked what grade I thought I deserved, and I told him a B- (I was in C territory before the oral exam and final exam).  He ended up giving me an B+.<p>The last year was weird.  It was really the first time I thought I could really, truly do physics.  I worked with other students, and I realized that a large portion of the students who I thought were better students were better focused and better working in groups.  These same students even thought of me as really smart (and still tell me that).  Overall, I don't think I'm smarter than they are, but I do think we have different strengths.  To this day, I still feel like I got lucky, and that my bosses didn't bother to check my GPA because of my enthusiasm for the position (and writing skills)<p>I do have ADHD, and I know for a fact that's a driving force in this because I have a hard time focusing on many tasks.  I've gotten much better at it, especially after having a regular job with a regular schedule, but I still have a hard time believing where I'm at.",1313616213

Apple can afford to be tightlipped about this sort of stuff, but others can't.  Developers <i>will</i> be the earlyvangelists for new products <i>if companies will let them be</i>.  That means supporting them, and Palm and then HP both dillydallyed around way too long in both cases.  I say this as someone who'd signed up for the SDK for the original webOS launch, and waited, and waited, and waited, then was rather disappointed with what was eventually released.<p>Yes, Apple does have a lot of stuff in place, but <i>what is stopping other companies from doing this</i>?  It won't be overnight, sure.  It takes a long term vision, and perhaps Apple really is the only large company that can execute on this.  I don't see HP, Dell, Lenovo or any other PC/electronics company having even a medium term vision, let alone a long term one, when it comes to consumer electronics and computing.<p><i>MAYBE</i> Google could fill this?  Maybe.  But really only if they get in to the hardware and retail game.  Apple controls the hardware and software and sales channel, and can create a strong, consistent and cohesive experience.  No one else can do this - the hardware guys point the fingers at licensed software, retail chains push whatever they get a big check for, etc.<p>So, yes, Apple makes it look easy, and it's not, but it's certainly <i>possible</i>.

Equally, someone who is charming is just as likely to be a sociopath as a frustrated technical person with no social skills.<p>So thanks for your single data point of an angry person who was also a sociopath.<p>Your post is equivalent to writing: ""We had a technical guy. Very polite. But he was black. When we asked him to do something he deleted all our work. Turns out he did this at the next five jobs.  Be careful hiring black people"".<p>Being black, or white, or martian, or having anger management issues, are not relevant. Being a sociopath is relevant.",1313614976

It's foolish to predict the results of international quasi-legal panels and US judges and juries when it only takes one claim on one infringing patent. Even newcomer HTC has stockpiled hundreds of patents by now, some of which Apple has already been declared to be infringing.<p><i>If anyone had the patent position to keep Apple out of the market, rest assured that they would have regardless of Apple's lawsuits.</i><p>No, I don't agree with that at all. The vast majority of all patents are never litigated and it's very rare that any large-budget manufacturer is actually kept out of a market as general as mobile touch-screen phones.<p>Normally patents are ignored, occasionally they're pooled or cross-licensed. Usually only trolls end up going as far as actually obtaining a suspension of sales and imports, but even then their goal is payment.<p>This is what makes Apple's decision to start a ""real"" patent war with HTC (and all Android makers by extension) so exceptional. Apple has as much to lose as anyone.",1313614972

2896945,comment,2895474,2896773,2,0,aphyr,,,"Perhaps we misunderstood one another. When I said ""without loss of generality"", I meant that for almost <i>any</i> conceivable objective function, free markets may not maximize that function. For a social objective like ""the weighted average of the self-actualization of all people in their individual ways"", a market may be non-optimal. I hesitate to construct an example for fear of getting bogged down in one particular case, but Jerf's efficient pricing of slavery comes to mind. Another might be the well-being of nonparticipants; for instance, habitat preservation for wildlife.<p>I argue that the only function that a free market <i>can</i> optimize for is the market itself; all other consequences such as happiness, fulfillment, distribution of experiences etc., are side effects which arise from coupling the market to the world via the decisions of participants, regulations, etc. Only if you assume <i>perfect</i> coupling of the market to the global objective is the system morally optimal.<p><i>In all cases, free trade will make all parties better off on the whole</i><p>This, however, makes it sound like you <i>are</i> assuming perfect coupling in the absence of any regulation, or that your objective function is the execution of the free market itself, and not, say, the well-being of the individuals and societies participating in it. I must not understand you correctly.",1313614946

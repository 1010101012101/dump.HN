Then all objects have type ThePythonType.<p>A more useful type system would have &quot;union types&quot;. They differ from sum types in that you can construct a union type from existing types in an ad-hoc manner. For example, if you have a function that returns a string or nil you can construct a union type &quot;Union of string or nil&quot;. To do this with a sum type you&#x27;d have to have a common super type of string and nil <i>and no other types</i>.<p>There are also intersection types, about which I know very little.",1406815137

At least for the short term future. I don&#x27;t know that solar will help in that case. The adoption of electric vehicles seems to be slow enough that it should give us time to identify the problems and attempt to come up with solutions.

8114086,comment,8113561,8113561,9,0,exDM69,,,"Formula 1 cars have energy recovery for kinetic energy (regenerative braking) and thermal energy (motor generator unit in turbocharger shaft). Both of these technologies have potential to be used for buses and other heavy vehicles that move in an urban environment.<p>As an example, my regular bus route is 50% highway at 80 km/h and 50% urban start-stop traffic. The city buses have a huge turbo diesel or natural gas engine, and the turbo takes about 3 seconds to spool up. At 80 km/h, drivers tend to be pumping on and off the throttle, purging the turbo pressure repeatedly. This is horrible for fuel efficiency.<p>Ideally, an electric motor should do the initial few seconds acceleration, while the turbo is being spooled up using the electric motor attached. When the turbo is spools up, the internal combustion engine should be slowly introduced by adding fuel according to the correct stoichiometric ratio. At cruise speeds, engine power could be regulated by harvesting energy off the turbine rather than pumping the gas pedal which purges the whole turbo.<p>A city bus should be able to operate at or near optimum stoichiometric conditions at all times, saving a ton of gas and emissions. Currently there&#x27;s a huge puff of black diesel smoke every time the bus leaves a bus stop.<p>These are very exciting times for anyone who is interested in motor sports technologies applied to efficient transport.",1406815002

It&#x27;s a Roman colonial town so it&#x27;s <i>old</i>. Can you guess which part was built first? How about which parts were built in the 18th 19th and 20th centuries?<p>As nice as the medieval quarter is for shopping, nobody really wanted to continue on with that kind of plan. By the 19th century (before cars) you ended up with a grid of broad roads and open boulevards. These things didn&#x27;t happen to accommodate cars, they happened because medieval city plans scale poorly. It turns out cars fit really nicely within this plan.<p>Look at London. With 1/3rd the population density of Barcelona, it&#x27;s cramped, and tight everywhere. Basic logistics costs are high because getting goods into and out of the city is difficult and time consuming. It&#x27;s one of those weird cities that developed right along the traditional medieval plan like what&#x27;s being advocated here and it&#x27;s an expensive cramped and often unpleasant place to live. Even if London suddenly started building up and increasing density, the city road system couldn&#x27;t handle it. It <i>has</i> to spread out because this kind of city plan scales poorly.<p>In some very old towns, ones that never really continued to develop, so they&#x27;re left with the medieval &quot;bones&quot;. Getting things like groceries to the shops is a circus of people physically moving hand trucks throughout the city.

Or backing a truck up to a loading dock and spending 15 minutes unloading a few palettes of goods?<p>Other than tourists, this is why nobody likes to live in Venice, despite it being one of the specific examples given here as a model city. In the slow seasons, Venice is one of the most beautiful, walkable cities in the world. It&#x27;s perfectly human scale.

There are fixed costs to existing in places. Just like it&#x27;s very expensive to live on an island, despite there being relatively few people there.

I seriously doubt that if I plug in an infected USB device to my Linux laptop its firmware will be able to alter the DNS settings (/etc/resolv.conf which is owned by root).  That sounds like a very OS-specific (probably Windows-specific) vulnerability.  My best guess is it has something to do with the &quot;automated whether you want it to be or not&quot; printer driver installation mechanism whereby Windows PCs inherently trust the driver that&#x27;s provided by the device.<p>The ability to modify the data as it&#x27;s copied seems like the only <i>actual</i> vulnerability to me.  As in, I write some executable to the USB drive and the firmware modifies the executable to perform other functions.

This is in one of the densest urban environments on the planet.<p>That&#x27;s 1/5th the cost of the per-mile system cost that I linked to earlier. Which was built on open and reserved right-of-way, all above ground, and didn&#x27;t require massive infrastructure rerouting or other kinds of issues you might face doing the same work in a dense urban environment.<p>If a developer was putting up 1,500 housing units, I&#x27;d bet they could afford to split the cost of the mile of mass transit rail running by their development if it ran ~$50m per mile.<p>Some back of the envelope math.<p>Wholesale costs on new housing is around $80-90/sq ft. So a 3,000 sq ft. home costs the developer ~$250,000.<p>A quarter acre of property (fairly standard these days for new suburban development) in an undeveloped or rural area runs around $5-20k. So we&#x27;re probably looking at a per unit cost of $300,000.<p>Financing construction of 1,600 units like this is $450m.<p>400 acres is under a square mile, but let&#x27;s add in roads and green space and things and this development would easily be 1 square mile.<p>Let&#x27;s say we want to put a subway stop right in the middle of this and run the track right on through in exchange for zoning the development.<p>In Korea, that&#x27;d be $50m.<p>In the U.S. that&#x27;d be $250m.<p>The developer isn&#x27;t going to eat that, so they build it into their per-unit cost.<p>In Korea, that&#x27;s a $31,250 additional per-unit cost. So my housing costs are about $330,000 per unit.<p>In the U.S.  that&#x27;s $156,250 per-unit. My housing costs are now $456,250 per unit.<p>The going price for single family homes in this area is $600,000. I can make a 45% ROI in Korea, while in the U.S. I&#x27;m only making 24%. My goal was to try to make 50% ROI.<p>24% is a pretty slim markup. Even if I boost the sale price of the houses \n(advertising easy access to the subway as justification), I&#x27;d have to hit $870,000 sale prices to hit 45% ROI and $900,000 sale prices to hit my target 50% in the U.S.<p>Are there enough buyers for that? Maybe. But it increases the developer risk substantially such that they may not bother at all.",1406812107

As for spectrum auctions, they are the solution favored by economists for dealing with scarce public resources. The idea of creating property rights in spectrum and auctioning them was proposed by none other than Ronald Coase: <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bfffd9fa-e9e2-11de-ae43-00144feab49a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/bfffd9fa-e9e2-11de-ae43-00144...</a>. Obviously the current spectrum auctions fall short of the ideal--it should be possible to use purchased spectrum for any use not just specified uses, but they&#x27;re much better than what we had before.<p>I favor using unlicensed bands for a lot of things,[1] but for cellular, dedicated bands auctioned to the highest bidder are probably the way to go.<p>[1] Specifically this: <a href=""http://werbach.com/research/supercommons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://werbach.com/research/supercommons.html</a>.",1406811981

This shocked me to some degree because it completely changed my view on most things in this world. But it also made me forget nearly everything from my years before I went to China. It&#x27;s strange to say this, but a grownup doesn&#x27;t often come into situations where he needs to recall specifics of his childhood. Therefore until now I never had a big problem with that, although it makes me still uncomfortable years later.",1406811873

A lot of inventors and discoverers of yore were wealthy aristocrats who did precisely that. There were however a lot more other types of wealthy aristocrats who engaged in less productive activities (binge drinking, gambling, building personal militias, etc). When assessing a policy like basic income we need to consider how society will change, not only what we as individuals would end up doing.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the disadvantages outweigh the benefits of basic income.

3407257,comment,3407197,3407197,0,0,juanre,,,"Very neat idea, but I think the reliance in bit.ly is self-defeating.  This kind of approach would allow people to distribute documents using the web without having to trust them to a particular server, which can be very convenient if your target audience is in a country where access to the server storing your documents can be closed.  For this to work you need to be able to recover the document from the URL locally.<p>Some years ago a friend and I wrote <a href=""http://notamap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://notamap.com</a>, a very similar idea for sharing/storing/embed geotagged notes fully encoded on a URL, without having to rely on a server.

But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can often times arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions.<p>I wish I UNDERSTOOD (very different then ""I wish I knew"") that 2 years ago when I was starting my company. Focusing on the problem, discussing it with the people that actually have that problem and not jumping immediately to solutions but ""peel the onion"" is something very very very hard to do.<p>Hope that next episodes of your article will provide more info about HOW to peel that onion :)",1325242052

2331560,comment,2330500,2330670,0,0,runningdogx,,,"(According to the IAEA) There was one measurement of 400mSv between reactors 3 and 4 [1], I think which actually occurred sometime on monday GMT (possibly Tuesday morning in Japan), which prompted the evacuation.  It fell again, which probably prompted the authorities to allow workers back in.<p>The 1000mSv figure is most likely a misreporting of the transient 1008 or 1080uSv (I recall it had an 8 in it) measurement reported over the weekend, or some subsequent measurement... there have been lots in and around the plant that have been on the order of 1000uSv.<p>I really wish everyone in the media speaking about the nuclear crisis would timestamp their comments accurately, ideally in GMT.  People all around the world are trying to follow events, and it's nearly impossible to know when some reporter says something about an event whether they're using Japanese time, their local time, or GMT.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/notes/international-atomic-energy-agency-iaea/japanese-earthquake-update-15-march-1125-utc/201923359837458"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/notes/international-atomic-energy-ag...</a>",1300273150

2331553,comment,2330467,2331234,0,0,bad_user,,,"ANTLR is a parser generator for CFGs and allows for flexibility in regards to ambiguity and context-dependent grammar by means of predicates. But the generated parsers are LL(k) (with enhancements, LL(star) they call it) and this brings certain problems with it, like the rules cannot be left-recursive.<p>As Terrence Parr said ""LL recognizers restrict the class of acceptable grammars somewhat"".<p>PEG rules cannot be ambiguous, as rules are tried out in order until one matches. Also recognizing tokens is part of processing rules, rather than having a separate lexer (which ANTLR does - lexer rules are separate from parser rules, and the code generated reflects that) - which means it is easier to deal with certain kinds of ambiguities.<p>This can work to your disadvantaged however. For example languages where whitespace is significant, like in Python where blocks are delimited by indentation level, the lexer needs to be hacked by hand (i.e. you have to cheat somewhere, because that's context-dependent and a bitch to deal with).<p>In general, ANTLR generated parsers are more efficient and allow for certain hacks to be implemented easily, but PEG grammars  are easier to write and allow for certain context-dependent rules that are very hard to implement in ANTLR. And PEG grammars need backtracking as an implementation detail and although memoization reduces the impact of that, the result will have less performance.<p>Basically for quick prototypes I would choose PEG grammars and for industrial strength something like ANTLR.<p>Btw, here's a cool Java/Scala library for creating PEG parsers, and it's much lighter and easier to setup than ANTLR: <a href=""https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki</a><p>And the syntax is basically Java/Scala:
<a href=""https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki/Simple-Java-Example"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled/wiki/Simple-Java-Examp...</a><p>AND the Scala way of defining grammars is so cool I can't even describe it - basically you can create new grammars by inheriting existing grammars - say you have a general SQL syntax that you want to specialize for MySQL / PostgreSQL. Works like a charm ;)",1300272881

My thanks to the author especially for a clear interpretation of the explosions. We need a clear head and should rely on facts in these situations. We also should not assume that nuclear reactors are not well constructed. I am sure they are. So it does not come as a surprise to me, that someone who knows the details is able to explain them in a way that it makes sense.<p>This does not excuse the fact that the reactors failed. This is a different story. But it helps to understand what really happens now. What the author did not stress is the fact that, as the Zircaloy structure may have failed, all subsequent pressure releases will be highly contaminated.<p>BTW, engineers are the ones who know best how safety is constructed, not scientists (I write this as someone who got his phd in atomic physics.

Each reactor core holds over 100 tons of uranium, of which about 3-5 tons is U-235.  Critical mass under perfect conditions is 50 kilograms.  Conditions are not perfect for forming a critical mass, but you've got 100 times as much U-235 as is strictly necessary, and there is no fucking way of knowing what will happen when an entire reactor core melts and flows together, because no one has ever been stupid enough to try it.  Chernobyl experienced a criticality event, and there is absolutely no guarantee that Fukushima will not.<p>Moreover, each reactor has a spent fuel pool with five times as much fuel in it as the reactor itself has.

The results follow,<p>10 or so Methods had 2000+ lines of code.
The maintainability index was 0 (number between 0 and 100 where 0 is unmaintainable).
The worst function had a cyclomatic complexity of 2500 (the worst I have ever seen on a function before was 750 odd).
It was full of nested inline dynamic SQL all of which refered to tables with 100+ columns, which had helpful names like sdf_324. There were about 5000 stored procedures of which most were 90% similar to other ones with a similar naming scheme. There were no foreign key constraints in the database.

People were assigned to computers and given either the receiver or transmitter to implement.<p>I was about done implementing the first draft of my side and asked the other side how it was going so we could test some actual communication. The response I got was ""it's about done, we just need to split it up into functions"". I was initially shocked and then naively impressed that someone could actually reason about the problem without breaking it down.<p>The end result was of course that I just had to give up and implement both sides of the communication. This was eventually a much better learning experience. I ended up abstracting out the serial port and allowing the two sides to communicate through a unix pipe with random bit errors introduced in packets to test the recovery.

I took my first computer class in grade 11 and always felt out of place since practically everyone in the class had been programming for a number of years already.  I got mediocre marks in university and even considered dropping out of Comp Sci because studying it didn't interest me.

Across the world -- in the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, South Africa and any country where they live side by side -- people of primarily Northeast Asian descent tend to commit crime at lower rates than people of primarily European descent, who in turn tend to commit crime at lower rates than people of primarily sub-Saharan African descent.<p>You can google the various crime stats if you aren't aware of this. Here are the California state statistics:<p><a href=""http://stats.doj.ca.gov/cjsc_stats/prof09/00/22.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.doj.ca.gov/cjsc_stats/prof09/00/22.htm</a><p>Divide that by California population totals to get the rank ordering of violent crime rates by population.<p>You can also look at table 43 of the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, which is fine for establishing the black/Asian violent crime ratio, but which lumps Hispanics in with whites, inflating the apparent white violent crime rate.<p><a href=""http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_43.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_43.html</a><p>Similar stats can be obtained for other countries with a bit of googling. Now, the absolute magnitudes do change (1), which one could legitimately ascribe to the local culture. But the trend is very consistent.<p>There isn't a country across the world that I'm aware of in which people of primarily sub-Saharan African descent commit crime at a lower rate (or have higher educational levels, incomes, and so on) than people of Northeast Asian descent. Interested in counterexamples, but this appears to be a very consistent pattern.<p>Obviously there are other factors as well. But the probability of looting seems to be proportional to a group's propensity to disorganized violence (e.g. murder, rape, robbery) and inversely proportional to their ability to commit organized violence (e.g. military actions).<p>No doubt this post is extraordinarily blasphemous. But someone had to say what a good fraction of the rest of the world is thinking.<p>(1) Cultural variation seems to shift magnitudes but not rank ordering. That is, it does not appear to be a large enough factor to make Northeast Asian descent individuals in country X commit more crime than sub-Saharan African descent individuals in country Y.

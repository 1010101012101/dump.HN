If you notice the anti-MBA feeling on the forum that they are useless on a team.<p>Well, how would hackers feel to be lumped into the category of a ""beast constrained by his class than a twelfth level paladin.""<p>The point is: Don't lump people based on their degree<p>",1178387197

Fileshares aren't going to work well on phones. Link sharing won't. Full-featured real time chatting won't (not the conference call).<p>That's because none of this is enjoyable on a dinky screen! Information driven social networks requires a medium that can transmit more information than 320x240 pixels. And going beyong that would require you to sit down at a coffee shop or something, in order to focus and digest that information. And at that time I'd prefer a ultraportable with a long battery life.

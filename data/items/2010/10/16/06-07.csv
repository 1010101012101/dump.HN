1797479,story,,,6,5,anarcticpuffin,"[How] Should I hire my brother-in-law?",,"My brother-in-law graduated this past May with a CS degree from a middle-tier private university.  After an honest shot at finding a job with nothing to show for it, he's begun to hit a wall.  He's not alone, as evidenced in a slew of recent articles:<p>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124181970915002009.html<p>http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/06/25/70788/recessions-toll-most-recent-college.html<p>I'm beginning to get worried that his hot & steamin' degree is about to get cold and soggy if he doesn't get some work experience to keep his resume moving.  He isn't as motivated as the typical entrepreneur-type on HN so I don't think he'd start his own venture by himself.<p>So here's where my question for HN comes in...  I've had a couple of ideas up my sleeve but no time to implement them (my day job writing HFT software has me pretty tied-up).  Do you think it's a good idea to hire my brother-in-law to kick off a venture that I otherwise wouldn't have the focus for?<p>If the answer is yes, how should he be paid?  Here are my concerns:<p>* Paid in equity - He needs some immediate pay for his efforts.  If the project fizzles out because I don't help him execute, he never gets any compensation for this.<p>* Paid per hour - He is very inexperienced, especially with high performance and/or web development.  Most of his hours will be spent learning.  I don't necessarily want to throw money out the window to train him on things that I would be doing for fun in his position.<p>* Paid per deliverable - This seems like the best bet, almost like hiring a consultant.  Am I wrong on this?<p>* Some hybrid of equity & hourly or deliverable - This would provide a vested interested in the venture plus offer some immediate cash.<p>I've specifically avoided including ""experience and training"" in the compensation list because I know this has a stigma on HN.  Although I do think he will be gaining some very valuable programming knowledge in this pursuit.<p>So, what are you thoughts?",1287210345

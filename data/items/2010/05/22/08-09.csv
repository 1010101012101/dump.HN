1370040,comment,1369984,1369984,0,0,timcederman,,,"What's interesting to me is that customer development (at least the early stages) is a more commercial-friendly form of participatory design.<p>I did a PhD in embedded computer systems design which described ""realistic"" methods for designing new products with small teams through intense engagement with your future users.  This was in an academic setting though, and I'd been wondering how to ""sell"" the idea of participatory design in much the same way user-centred design had been to companies as an alternative to traditional design methods.<p>Then I read Steve Blank's customer development strategies. Beaten to the punch. So I'm curious - is Steve aware of PD?  What inspired CD?<p>Anyway, to answer the OP - working as an external designer/developer for a small dental firm, I found that our approach, which was very similar to CD in a lot of ways, was very useful for learning what <i>truly</i> mattered to the customer.  You are able to cut away the cruft from the design process very quickly.  It's hard to tell what people want by watching them, it's hard to tell what they want by having them tell you, but it's easy when you collaborate with them in the design process.<p>The hardest part is it takes up a lot of time, but when you're establishing a toe-hold in the market, that's ok, and it's a differentiator for your company. We made a lot of people very happy by fulfilling their needs really well.",1274518565

1370037,comment,1368051,1369753,0,0,chousuke,,,"I don't understand this sentiment. Kanji are an integral part of the japanese language, and much of it doesn't make sense without them.<p>You can and should start studying kanji as soon as you have a reasonable command of hiragana. Every time you learn a new word you should at least check the characters it's written with instead of pretending that it's okay to use hiragana for everything.<p>My experience has been that I sometimes actually understand words I've never heard before because I can connect the syllables with kanji whose meaning fits the context.<p>It's up to you to balance your time between learning the written language and learning the spoken language, but they are not independent of each other, and ignoring kanji in the beginning is a mistake.",1274518231

1370029,comment,1369781,1369909,0,0,natep,,,"Actually, that is similar to the position of a physicist, just without the words ""easily"" and ""probably"". For instance, what happened before the big bang has no effect on the current universe, which is why there's so much research into the first moments of the big bang, and not into any point in time before then.<p>But to address your comment specifically, I couldn't disagree more. Unless, of course you're just trolling by making a rediculous statement without any backing evidence in a discussion about pseudoscience, in which case, well done.<p>First, all of the parent's examples are hypotheses that are hard to test, not hard to observe. It's hard to test just how much better NoSQL/SQL is for a given task, but not hard to see that there are differences in performance if you were to, say, implement both systems. I'd like to see you change the management methodology for a company and not see a change. Same goes for his outsourcing example.<p>Second, I do not think there is a logical connection between your conclusion and your premise. Since you haven't given a single iota or proof for your claim, I don't think I need any proof to counter it.<p>Finally, even if we aren't doing ""physics"" (what ever your definition of that is), why does that mean pseudoscience is acceptable?",1274517449

1370027,comment,1367692,1367692,0,0,chipsy,,,"You have to patronize at least a little bit to write something that is more than a glorified assembly language - otherwise you have no basis to build your other abstractions on.<p>With C, for example, there's a predefined model for the callstack based around having a fixed set of arguments for function calls and singular return values.<p>Forth, on the other hand, treats words as simple nested subroutines, keeps data on a global stack, and lets the data carry over from one word to the next. No explicit arguments or return values are necessary.<p>C can be characterized as ""safe,"" while Forth is ""flexible,"" depending on your use case, but in terms of pure performance both models have strengths and weaknesses.",1274517144

1370025,comment,1369947,1369947,0,0,rewind,,,"I think one thing to be careful of is the ""we did this so it must work"" theme vs. ""this is what we're going to do and will prove that it will work"" theme.<p>I'm a fan of 37S as entrepreneurs, and those guys come across really well in their posts and in interviews, and they're obviously smart guys. But look at how much advice is out there these days, whether in books or in blog posts about ""how we did it"". How many are after the success has already been achieved? Can they REALLY tell you the secrets to their (duplicable) success? Or was it just a specific set of circumstances than might not be as easily repeatable as everyone would like to think will come from buying a $10 eBook?<p>Can you give an example of a company who laid out all their big ideas BEFORE they launched and made it work? How many vs. the companies that did A, B, X, Y, & Z and then told you ""this is the way to did it to become successful"" AFTER they were a hit? It's a bit like the stock market sometimes: anyone can see trends and patterns when looking at old charts. It doesn't (necessarily) mean anything.<p>Hindsight is 20/20, and it's sometimes blinding.",1274517067

But the algorithm for beating Tetris is not complicated, and you have plenty of time to move the pieces to their optimal locations.<p>I believe this is inaccurate. If you play long enough, you always lose. Proof: You cannot cleanly make lines with only s-pieces. If you assume a random distribution of pieces, you eventually get a string of s-pieces long enough to exhaust the game board, though you can keep it going for a very long time.<p>I would like to hear this uncomplicated algorithm for beating tetris.",1453568307

10958924,comment,10958834,10958834,0,0,ddingus,,,"If you have a newer Samsung Phone, the &quot;Ultra Power Saving Mode&quot; is absolutely insane great!<p>The phone will standby for 20 some days, able to take SMS or a call the whole time, on a full charge.  Light SMS use will not impact this much at all.  I&#x27;ve used this on occasion to stay mobile for about a week on one charge, using the phone for SMS, light Internet and some calls.  Was curious just how far one could stretch something like this.<p>In this mode, BTW, Chrome will still do a lot of things, such as play mp3 files, view many documents, can access a browser e-mail portal, and so forth.  Most of the phone is disabled, but you still get SMS and calls, in addition to Chrome.  Be sure and make a link to your data directories in advance, so it&#x27;s easy to nav the filesystem in Chrome.<p>They missed some things:<p>1.  Airplane mode.  Use it to go long stretches, or to rapid charge off other devices.  This is also very useful when connections are spotty.  The phone will spend energy seeking networks.  If you know where to get a connection, airplane mode helps a lot when you know you are not where there is a connection, or you don&#x27;t need one for a stretch.<p>2.  Turn off bluetooth and wi-fi.  You probably won&#x27;t need either of those, if you really need a phone.<p>3.  Turn off advanced features, such as &quot;keep screen active when I&#x27;m looking at it&quot; kinds of modes.  You can use the power button to toggle this and manage the use of the screen down to bare minimums.<p>One example might be, turning off your lock screen, so the phone is just active when you want it to be.  This is CPU and display time you could use for a call, so ditch it for a little while.<p>Making a call means, tapping screen or power to access the GUI, initiate the call quickly, on your first ring, tap power to kill the screen, and you complete your call on a dark phone to maximize the battery savings.<p>4.  On some phones, a power on can take as much as a few percent of the battery capacity.  Measure this now, and you can balance standby techniques (airplane and low power type modes) with operating the phone at important times.<p>You may find turning the phone off to be a good balance.  It&#x27;s not on my device, due to how crazy good the &quot;Ultra Low Power Saving Mode&quot; is.  My older Moto Droid consumed 4 percent on restart.<p>5.  This one may be difficult, or unavailable, but there are apps out there to manage the radio too.  You can put the thing in simple &quot;1x&quot; data mode, no 3G / 4G, etc... and get longer calls on less power, depending on a lot of things.  Doing this on the Note phones doesn&#x27;t make sense, particularly the newer ones that have aggressive power savings, but it did matter on my Moto Droid phones.  Mattered a lot.  This will limit you to first gen data, which is basically dialup modem type speeds, SMS and calls, but some phones also run considerably longer.<p>6.  If you can&#x27;t disable advance things, like &quot;pocket detect&quot;, just don&#x27;t carry the thing around.<p>7.  All of the monitoring type functionality, like &quot;OK Google&quot; consumes power too.  Ditch it where possible.  Often, a power saving mode does this for you.<p>8. Keep the phone temp near average, &quot;normal&quot;  A power on when the phone is cold will take more of the battery than when it&#x27;s all normal, room or body temp.  This can matter when you are down to that last few percent and need to make one more call.  You&#x27;ve shut it down at say, 5 percent.<p>If you turn it on when it&#x27;s really cold, the phone may see  3 percent, for example.  It might start up, then shut right back down, or only operate for a short time.  Warm the phone with your body, then attempt this for a bit longer run / call time.  Battery potential varies by temp.<p>9. Do your testing and charging now.<p>I like to explore this stuff when I get a new device.  I&#x27;ll do &quot;stretch&quot; times just to understand what the dynamics are.  Sometimes, I&#x27;m off in remote places, or things happen.  Both of those are not the time to be working understand how this all works for you and your phone.<p>10.  If you can remove the battery entirely during long &quot;save the phone stretches&quot; do it.  Some phones continue to sip at the battery when powered off.  Be sure phone and battery are as warm as you are, when you do want to power that phone back up.<p>11.  Automatic brightness may be a savings too.  Turn it off, then set the display to it&#x27;s minimums.  You can always find some dark to use the phone.  This can be a very significant savings.<p>12.  Turn off location, etc... unless you may need it, and when you do, turn it on then.<p>13.  Consider learning how to turn the phone on in safe mode.  This generally does not launch power hungry apps.  It can be a lean way to operate the phone for a long no power stretch.<p>14.  It&#x27;s all about priorities.  Everything costs something, and you want to maximize the phone functionality you need.  This is written with the assumption that priority is calls and SMS.",1453567734

10958905,comment,10958579,10958579,0,0,danbruc,,,"I think the question of 10x engineers is actually ill-defined. There are developers I can consistently outperform by a factor of ten, do in half a day what they spent an entire week on and end up with a better solution. They are not necessarily fresh out of school but somehow managed to survive year after year even though they don&#x27;t even know the language they are developing in. And I don&#x27;t mean the ugly details of the memory model but basics for professional developers like generics or interfaces.<p>But what does that proof? I think nobody doubts that the difference between a bad developer and a good one can be a factor of ten or more. Outperforming a good developer by a factor of ten is a totally different story. It is certainly possible if you have some good insight, if you spot some non-obvious structure in the problem that you can exploit to make your life a lot easier.

Your team, your company, the entire industry? I would argue that the age respectively experience structure is really important.

The Paul Graham article is in large part talking about the power of meta-programming. In this regard, D and C++ are significantly more powerful in that regard. Features like higher kinded types (template templates), variadics, and non-type template parameters help in this matter. When you can write a function that can generically work with a tuple with any number and type of parameters, you can do some pretty neat stuff. For some examples take a look at Boost.Hana by Louis Dionne (<a href=""http://boostorg.github.io/hana/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boostorg.github.io/hana/</a>). In this regards, Rust is actually the Blub compared to D and C++.",1453567128

The only practical difference is that precompiling means your modules will <i>load</i> faster the <i>first</i> time, but there will be no difference for subsequent loads since modules are cached. I&#x27;m guessing the caveat for running something like babel-register in production is the first-load performance penalty, as well as having less control over the compilation process. However, if you are ok with configuring babel through .babelrc files alone, and you&#x27;re ok with the first-load performance penalty, I don&#x27;t see what it&#x27;d be any worse than precompiling to ES5.

For most of us, it&#x27;s pretty obvious because we&#x27;ve probably worked with one. (If you haven&#x27;t: you might want to rethink your job choices :-))<p>If you think about it, there&#x27;s essentially no physical or finite limit to how much you can get done in a day with software (outside of, like, typing speed), so it boils down to how fast and comprehensively you can think. So you might think, well, nobody is 10x smarter than anyone else, and that&#x27;s probably true, but you could certainly imagine someone that has learned 10x more and has 10x more experience and given the right context can apply that effectively.<p>I strongly agree with the no-jerks part. I think, short term, you can be a jerk and still be effective, but long term if you&#x27;re unpleasant you&#x27;ll develop blind spots because people don&#x27;t want to deal with you. Once you have significant blind spots, I suspect it&#x27;s very hard to maintain the 10x pace. There is of course, a strong counter example here, which would be someone like linus torvalds (who is both extremely effective, and, by his own admission, kind of a jerk), but I think while exceptions like that exist they&#x27;re not the common case.",1453565551

Other than living together we were all leading entirely separate lives. Different majors, different friend groups, etc. We&#x27;d see each other in the evenings but that was pretty much it.<p>The size of the school (~30k students) also didn&#x27;t help me - the chances of me sharing a class with someone in my dorm were pretty low. Even big classes like Composition, there&#x27;s probably 40 different composition classes being taught at any semester. I did have one or two people from my History class in my dorm, but that class had 400 people in the auditorium, so not really conducive to discussions. I was just one fish in a really, really big sea.<p>It was compounded by being an out-of-state student from a long way away from home. Many of the people in the dorm with me were in-state students, many from the same large high schools in the major cities. They came with a built-in networks of friends, many of whom were in the same or adjacent dorms. I knew one other person from my city at all, and he lived on the other side of campus.<p>So in my particular case, I had a lot working against me. I have no problems believing many people had a great time socializing in dorm life, but I just couldn&#x27;t develop a connection with anyone there because of the sheer magnitude of the issues.<p>Which was kinda why it was so weird my friend invited me to rush. We&#x27;d sat next together in Intro to Engineering and chatted a few times, maybe sat together once in the cafeteria and studied for class, but not exactly what I would have called a deep connection. It was really surprising when I was offered that invitation.<p>In a fraternity, though, you are <i>forced</i> to build that connection. It&#x27;s pretty much the entire point of the organization. If you want to be a part of the organization, you <i>have</i> to be a part of the brotherhood. You <i>have</i> to develop a connection with those in your pledge class (those who join the fraternity the same time you do), or you drop out or get dropped out.<p>I started with a smaller number of people that I could get to know (there were 11 people in my pledge class, a much smaller number for me to work with). And because we had tasks to work towards together, both as a pledge class and as an organization, we learned to work together with each other. I can&#x27;t speak for every fraternity, but mine was super, super big on requiring us to work together. There was only one thing we were ever asked to do as individuals. Every single other thing we were expected to do as a class or as an entire organization. With requirements like that, I couldn&#x27;t help but get to know people.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this type of thing is for everyone, but it really did work out well for me and for everyone else in my pledge class.<p>> One thing that does occur to me though, is in the UK alcohol is readily available to students. I realise US colleges are hardly dry, but I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s not quite the same as the UK, where almost every student will have their own stock of preferred drinks ready for any social occasion.<p>My school, a large state university, was actually completely dry (officially, at least). Part of it is the drinking age in the US is 21, so only upperclassmen are even above that level at all. But even if you were over 21, alcohol was prohibited on campus. All the dorms, buildings and grounds were dry.<p>But this was pretty widely ignored, even by the administration. Generally speaking, as long as you weren&#x27;t making an ass out of yourself or driving, you were okay. Sophomore year I traded beers with my RA (the person in charge of the dorm) on a pretty regular basis.",1453565362

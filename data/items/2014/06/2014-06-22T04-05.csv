To my knowledge it is the only keyword-base search engine based entirely in the browser.<p>I agree with your remark about Google, I was trying to be witty but often my humor fails me, as my family and friend will be eager to confirm :) Given that Google doesn&#x27;t have public APIs, even paid ones, for any of their search services, leads me to believe the numbers just don&#x27;t add up for them.<p>With regards to angering publishers: I really really do not want to come on their bad side, and I can&#x27;t see how this project could.

To me OO was inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and so on.  Years later, when distributed and scalable computing is talked about other languages and platforms seems more OO than the classic OO.<p>And finally one more excerpt:<p>><p>---<p><pre><code>  1. Everything is an object\n\n  2. Objects communicate by sending and receiving messages (in terms of objects) Objects have their own memory (in terms of objects)\n\n  3. Every object is an instance of a class (which must be an object) The class holds the shared behavior for its instances (in the form of objects in a program list)\n</code></pre>\n---<p>Pretty funny. Replace &#x27;object&#x27; with &#x27;process&#x27; and you have Erlang, the last language you&#x27;d call OO : 1) everything is a process 2) processes sending messages to each other.

Threats do not have to be overtly threatening. A person in the room that dislikes you and has a lot of money and time can be just as threatening as a person in the room claiming to have a gun at home and an aversion towards your faith/gender/culture.<p>I come from a place where people blindly believe the US is the best[sic] nation in the world. Anyone that disagrees is obviously some &quot;egghead/pinko/etc&quot; who can&#x27;t appreciate the sacrifice of others. This, the opposite extreme, is a s frustrating as the words of the dullard who penned this piece. I confront it constantly in an attempt to represent the middle path. In my years of argument, discussion, and reassessment, i have come to realize that nothing is quite what it seems. To make absolute statements, for or against anything, is to place oneself in an inherently weak position intellectually.<p>The author shrugs at Russia&#x27;s expansionist aggression, pointing out their economic weakness as a reason they are no threat to the US. The approach to China and Venezuela is similarly misguided. Threats != weapons. Europe&#x27;s relative peace since world war 2 is largely because of the US being extremely security minded.<p>...but who knows. Maybe Russia bullying its neighbors is just as symptom of it being misunderstood. Maybe China steals technology and data because they are just in that adolescent &quot;acting out&quot; phase. Maybe the world is really a nice place and the US is ruining the party for everyone.<p>:|",1434203841

But to single it out as the core of our advancements is false.<p>For example, the greatest source of our improved economic equality and growth globally is improved productivity in managed industrial processes brought to light in various phases by Henry Ford, Fredrick Taylor, Taiichi Ohno & Sheigo Shingo, and Edwards Deming.  Math, particularly statistical analysis, queuing theory, etc. is a part of all of that, but not the core insight, and not even required to understand and apply the approaches, methods.<p>Similarly, our greatest achievements in understanding macroeconomic systems come from fairly basic models like IS-LM that have stood the test of time.   Advanced mathematical models of the economy, like Real Business Cycle theory have tried to fit reality to their maths, with disastrous policy results.  Blind faith in advanced maths placed at the heart of the shadow banking system is what almost destroyed the world economy in 2008.<p>&quot;It is far more universal than programming&quot;<p>Philosophy is more universal than all of these topics, but I don&#x27;t necessarily see it as requiring primary importance.<p>Math is traditionally one of several liberal arts, and not particularly central.  There&#x27;s also language & literature, history, psychology, science (in various sub-forms), art, music.   I&#x27;d add systems engineering to this list as another key subject area that&#x27;s been necessary for our advancement.

The OS can automatically open a simple browser to do the auth, then allow all traffic.  (Or in the case of an unsafe network, allow the VPN to initialize, then allow all.)<p>If that&#x27;s too much to ask for, it would at least be nice to have some solution to the problem of HTTPS requests before the captive portal has granted access.  The current choices seem to be a) drop all HTTPS packets, so the user waits for a page to load until they figure out they are captive, b) break the connection, so the user sees weird errors like &quot;connection reset&quot;, c) MITM with a self-signed certificate or something, so the user gets cert errors, but if they go against best practice and bypass cert errors they&#x27;ll get redirected to the authentication URL.

9710879,comment,9709875,9709875,0,0,thatswrong0,,,"Ramblings:<p>I was recently talking with coworkers about intelligence, and the many forms of it that exist beyond just raw cognitive quickness, of course in the context of the company. There are social skills and being able to interact with people, curiosity, the ability to absorb information quickly, the ability to make cognitive leaps quickly, the ability to just get things done, etc.<p>I would say that these all qualify as different forms of intelligence. They all have their uses. Some can be trained / improved more than others. They also can conflict with each other at times. For example, one of my coworkers talked about how he spent a couple hours investigating the inner-workings of the Java garbage collector because of a bug that actually was caused by some code that was accidentally allocating orders of magnitude extra memory than intended. I laughed and said I was lazier and would never have bothered looking so deeply and would have just assumed I did something stupid. I see this as curiosity + quick cognitive leaps vs. getting things done.<p>Jumping to the end, the article talks about wisdom as a learnable skill. In this context, I would say that wisdom is yet another type of intelligence, one that can have an impact on your other intelligences, and it is one that is quite trainable.<p>Onto happiness - I think it&#x27;s a bit of a shame that society doesn&#x27;t attempt to teach &quot;happiness&quot;[0] more. Maybe this is a stretch, but I feel like there are some legitimate fundamental ideas and mental skills that could help a lot of people live more fulfilling lives.<p>In the case of worrying, for example, it would be helpful to be able to quickly identify <i>that</i> you&#x27;re worrying (which can be hard to catch!), ask yourself why you&#x27;re worrying, and then either come up with an plan to resolve it if it&#x27;s solvable or, in the case of agonizing over the human condition, accepting it as something that just is. This is something that you can practice.<p>Or goals. Schools seem to emphasize setting goals and creating plans to achieve them. But I feel like I was never taught about what to do once I reached a goal, or what to think about goals in general. Every time I reached a goal, I was satisfied briefly, and then I felt sort of an emptiness that accompanied the thought of &quot;That&#x27;s it? What now?&quot; Now that I&#x27;ve done plenty of reading (e.g. Mastery by George Leonard), I&#x27;ve learned to accept that while it&#x27;s useful to set goals, they&#x27;re inherently unsatisfying to achieve. Fulfillment lies in the struggle to achieve them, and the struggle never ends.<p>Maybe these kinds of things are hard to teach since they&#x27;re so inherently personal and learning them requires tight integration with personal motivations (which is hard to do on a grand scale), and maybe what works for me wouldn&#x27;t work for many others, but I still feel like there must be some &quot;happiness&quot; knowledge nuggets that could be taught broadly.<p>[0] I prefer fulfillment to happiness because it&#x27;s way more realistic. Minds are pretty chaotic, and I&#x27;ve found that even when I <i>should</i> be happy since everything is going well, I can be unhappy. Likewise, even when a lot of bad things happen, I can be really happy. Fulfillment, on the other hand, seems a lot more stable and less vulnerable to the random meandering of mood.",1434200701

Nothing, in my book.  The US managed to absorb plenty of poor immigrants from places like Ireland and Italy and you know what?  We've done just fine.<p>If you look that piece of legislation up, it was about liberalizing immigration quotas, not a ""political decision to turn American half Hispanic"".  That's conspiracy talk.<p>Also, projections include births, deaths and migrations, and if you look at the methodology document, Hispanic birth rates are far higher than the other categories (Ted Kennedy connection: he's a Catholic, they're mostly Catholics.  Coincidence, or all part of the master plan?).  Enough to account for those numbers without immigration?  Not sure.  Still, I'm not worried about it.  People blend in, in the US, if they want to go anywhere.

At the moment, I'm using mongodb with very simple first class object wrappers around the hash/dict.

With that I would just add that it is not just immigrants from China and India that we should be courting and treating better.<p>We should be getting immigrants from all over the world not just the larger cheaper labor markets. Tesla was from Serbia (Croatia now).  We should not have any precedence or preference to where smart immigrants are from.<p>But remember this, the larger the group of people, the more there are better skilled workers.  But also the larger the group of people the more there are mediocre or substandard skilled workers.<p>This doesn't mean that every skilled person we let in will be good.  Sure there will be more quality candidates from larger populaces than the US, but there will also be that many less skilled workers to the scale of the originating country compared to the US.<p>I am all for open immigration for skilled people and I think other countries should have the same policies. Largely on the latter point, they are just as xenophobic as the US is on this matter.",1251058069

I know when I first registered IIRC it was around 275,000.<p>However, if every account pays the minimum of $10.95 (the lowest rate for monthly subscription) that's almost 41 million dollars and they're finally making it available to buy timecards in-store, so the subscription will likely increase as it's essentially been for players with credit-cards and not teens.<p>Edit: This isn't always made clear about EVE. They have only one server, that's 310,000 users in on one server, roughly 40,000 at any one time. It's a much more impressive experience than WoW where you might never see another person, where as in EVE you can see hundreds of ships in one area that isn't a guild-war. Guild wars are, to put it quite frankly, insane to watch. I've seen a few hundred ships in a fire fight and I was a newbie.",1251058035

A most common approach is to have each of those dicts be a first class object in python/blub, and therefore you know the class of the object.  Customer.find() returns a customer which contains your dict.  No magic going on here.  You are not reinventing too much by deciding to use lightweight wrappers and eschew automated SQL generation or ORMS and related DSLs.",1251057993

780918,comment,780782,780782,0,0,jhancock,,,"I agree with Atwood's conclusion here.  If you must use both an OO second tier and a RDB 3rd tier, concessions must be made.  You can get around most concessions with more code at the hard parts, but sometimes its just not worth the effort.\nIn addition to these concessions, there have been choices of OODBs for quite a while.  We are now seeing some new DB choices come on the scene.<p>My perspective comes from having written what may have been the world's first ORM in Smalltalk in '88.  I then spent the next 14 years building them over and over along with a full stack of other frameworks in Smalltalk and Java.  Choices must be made.  No framework is one size fits all.  I generally sided with ""make the easy things easy/automated and make the hard things possible/maintainable"".<p>Is it Vietnam?  No.  You have far easier choices in how to develop your app than soldiers did in choosing wether or not to go to Vietnam.  I wrote very hard ORM and other framework code; solved problems that enabled my customer's projects to be far more productive; was paid very well; enjoyed a good life; worked hard and was respected for my contributions.

If you do not have ""unlimited"" or more than 6 or so months of funds to run the company you can not play with luxury items. For this particular case playing with a ""luxury input style"" not any means necessary for the problem or the application. This luxury input style feature is a monster funds eater. May be the application could run on any vps for years for a fraction of the funds the company burned for this monster servers. Some engineering and planning in time could help and prevent this failure.",1251057614

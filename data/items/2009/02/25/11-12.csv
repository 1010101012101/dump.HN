You can't also play a DVD in an oil rig, school bus or any other public place (that's on the DVD agreement, right there when you turn it on). And if having your book reproduced as audio offends the 'Book Guild agreement', then you probably can't do it 'legally'.

People naturally gravitate towards a feeling of unhappiness. I believe that if you look at most religions over the years, instead of finding out about religion, you end up finding out about the natural emotional state of man, i.e. that people are hard-wired to feel certain ways and they'll find some way of feeling them no matter what the age is.<p>Overall, this is a good thing -- drives innovation, keeps societies from stagnating, etc. In fact, hell would be a society in which everybody was perfectly at peace all the time.

There was a piece of research that looked at applicants to Ivy Leagues and applicants to magnet schools.  For applicants of High School Magnet schools, the leading indicator was not whether they got in, but rather if they applied.  For people who got into Ivy Leagues, the leading indicator was if they ""chose"" to go somewhere else and get an education there instead.<p>There's an inmeasuable quality of ambition that cannot be quantified on paper.  I personally know many of my friends who have gotten into ""prestigious"" Universities who are not doing as well as some of my other friends.<p>It's the same reason why Nobel Laureates come from various universities.  If the measuring tool to get into Ivy Leagues were a perfect indicator, these professors would be considered a fluke.<p>I've come to realize more and more that tests are inherently flawed.",1235562298

They are people willing to spend thousands of hours finding out how things work, including things that don't yet exist. There's a joke about engineers that captures the spirit of many participants in creative collaborations. An engineer meets a frog who offers the engineer anything he wants if he will kiss the frog. ""No,"" says the engineer. ""Come on,"" says the frog. ""Kiss me, and I'll turn into a beautiful woman."" ""Nah,"" says the engineer.

Coming from Fog Creek, that statement has no weasel words in it, it&#x27;s a genuine sentiment.<p>Back when I was working for the company on site, my father had his leg broken by an out of control snow boarder right before Thanksgiving. When I was home for the holiday, I realized he needed help around the house, so I asked to work remotely for a week to help him out. Joel and Michael gave me the time and told me to do whatever work I could, but not to worry if it was less than usual. I fully expected to sacrifice a vacation day or two, but they made it clear that wasn&#x27;t necessary, even though I spent half of my time helping my father.<p>And what did I do while I was working? I wrote longer commit messages, checked in on chat, and updated my Fog Bugz cases because I didn&#x27;t want to feel like I was taking advantage of my company&#x27;s generosity.<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember, in most industries, trust like this is totally unheard of. We are very fortunate to work in an industry where it is a more common practice.<p>[0] I left the company about 18 months ago to pursue my own startup.",1379051775

The sender uses the public key to sign, the receiver uses the private key to verify.<p>If we stipulate that info burned into the CPU isn&#x27;t secure against extraction, then an attacker can get the private key. Obviously, he can obtain the public key much more easily from then update blob.<p>And now they can generate malicious updates.<p>The security of even the RSA system seems to rest on the difficulty of extracting the private key from the CPU.<p>Am I missing something?",1379051767

I have friends that have launched very successful startups that were extremely secretive prior to launch.  I do not see why it should be a generalized statement.<p>If you know how to do due diligence and come from a background in business, why do you need to be open with everyone about what you&#x27;re working on?  Yes, if you&#x27;re a young kid and green behind the ears, you should probably not be too secretive.  But you can talk to a handful of trusted, knowledgeable people without needing to be completely open with everybody you meet.<p>Does 42 Floors write blog posts about all of their ideas and everything that they are developing?  Maybe they do, I don&#x27;t know.  As soon as they have real competitors, they will stop - or maybe they will not and I think that decision will be a function of market position.  If 42 Floors has an unshakeable market position, they will be as open as can be.  If there is a threat and they&#x27;ve lost considerable marketshare to that threat, they will be less open about the competitive ideas they have going forward IMO.<p>We&#x27;re working on a company right now that has competitors that, if they had the eureka moment that we have had, would run with it.  There is no reason to even risk exposing them to our ideas.  So we speak in very broad terms when we discuss what we are working on.<p>I am going to do some more reading but I do not understand the mentality of share all of your ideas openly and everything will be okay.<p>Can someone please ELI5 the logic underlying this orthodoxy?<p>Thanks and I post this with all due respect.

I had a bigger point I was trying to make, and I apologize if I missed the mark and struck a nerve.<p>I&#x27;m addressing the article&#x27;s idea that you can take a kid in college out of college and somehow that&#x27;s a magical formula.<p>Becoming a adult means leaving home, becoming your own person (not in the high school &quot;I&#x27;m finding myself...&quot; sense), and experiencing success and failure purely of your own accord.<p>The author I feel referred to the Thiel folks as children because they hadn&#x27;t crossed these thresholds. Adulthood in my sense of the word seems to me to be a necessary prerequisite for business success. Collge <i>can</i> help a person grow in these areas of their life. It&#x27;s no guarantee, and it&#x27;s possible to grow outside of college.<p>What doesn&#x27;t work is taking a kid who lived in mommy and/or daddy&#x27;s house, went to college on mommy/daddy&#x27;s dime, and drove the car they were given, and then have someone come along and become a new mommy/daddy holding their hand while they start a business. I don&#x27;t think anyone can be successful without having experience success, and perhaps even more importantly, failure.<p>My outlook is filtered by my own experience. I&#x27;ve lived on my own since age 17, and didn&#x27;t get my first car until age 23 (because the only way I could get one was to buy it myself.. my entire childhood, my parents didn&#x27;t have a car). I was a college dropout (wanted to stay, couldn&#x27;t afford it, and made mistakes with regard to student loans that I was to blame for). No computer in my home until I bought one myself. Taught myself programming, built up a career over time. No hand holding, everything I have I paid for, and I have no safety net. That said, I&#x27;ve made plenty of mistakes, and I deserve everything I have, nor don&#x27;t have, right now.<p>Perhaps that leaves me bitter; I don&#x27;t think so.

I&#x27;ve been tested by one of Australia&#x27;s spy agencies [we have about six] using MBTI, and came out as an INTJ, with extreme &#x27;I&#x27; characteristics. One way to put that would be to say that I have almost <i>no</i> external locus of control. That doesn&#x27;t mean I am immune to reasoned argument, quite the reverse; the <i>only</i> way to change my mind is by reasoned argument. I cannot and will not be browbeaten or blackmailed by anyone.<p>So what is this guy like in the workplace? Surely that Himalayan ego is a serious problem? Surely those Asperger-like symptoms are an impediment to corporate success? Can he work with, like, real people? In fact, I have led several teams to great success, because my ego is unthreatened by the brilliance and skill of the people who work for me. If someone has a better idea than mine, I don&#x27;t feel the need to stomp on it. Quite the reverse; I&#x27;m proud to have the best and brightest working for me, I&#x27;m not scared of occasional failure, and I have a reputation as a great &#x27;people person&#x27;, a description that my secret self considers utterly bogus. I dislike physical contact, for example, and sometimes have trouble reading people, but I compensate for that because I am almost impossible to offend, unconcerned with personalities, and often barely aware of the people aspects when I wade into &#x27;difficult&#x27; office situations.<p>So MBTI is a bit like horoscopes, or phenotypes and genotypes. It&#x27;s not deterministic, it&#x27;s indicative. Just because you and I have INTJ stamped on our foreheads, it doesn&#x27;t mean that we <i>can&#x27;t</i> be effective in situations thought to be more suited to the touchy-feely types; as an INTJ, I never play favourites, focusing instead on solving the problem rather than playing to the audience. Sometimes the INTJ&#x27;s highly analytic approach to everything can be more effective in managing people than emoting all over them and wanting everyone to be your friend.<p>If you want to go to Europe and see stuff, do it. You might want to do it INTJ-style, preparing a detailed dossier on everything, mapping out locations, travel dates and times, selecting odd things aligned with your interests [Vesalius&#x27;s dissecting room at Padua is still there, for example, and surely the LHC would be on your list], but hey, what&#x27;s wrong with that?",1379050919

I mean, is it seriously asking that much for you to get a good headset and have a room for working? Working from home at all is a tremendous privilege, and these strike me as relatively minor requests over the long run. If it was requested that you dress up, then yes, that would be ridiculous.<p>However, the tone of this post honestly sounds a little frustrated with remote work rather than supportive of it, and I think that is what is leading to the comments here. After reading this, my impression is the author doesn&#x27;t trust remote developers (despite a claim to the contrary) and that he generally looks down on remote developers. I would worry that remote developers are not seen as first-class citizens of the developer ecosystem at the company.<p>In short, even though I agree with these rules for the most part, remote development is something that needs to either be rejected or embraced, not regulated. There&#x27;s not much middle-ground, because that&#x27;s going to lead to micro-management.",1379049019

There are jobs that require specifically to-the-second availability called &quot;customer service agent&quot; or &quot;receptionist,&quot; and timeliness is their whole point of existing and they pay a <i>lot</i> less which tells me that just being there isn&#x27;t worth all that much.<p>Otherwise, wherever and whenever you&#x27;re working, you should be judged on the outcome of those projects for which you&#x27;re responsible, nothing else. If collaboration is required, your smart people (you hire people that are smarter than you in their field right?) will know they need to deliver their best in order to keep their jobs so they will work it out themselves. How that&#x27;s going to happen, whether if it means getting together in an office, temporary conference room, Skype, or google hangout they probably know more options than you do.

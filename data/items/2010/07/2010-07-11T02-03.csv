1504827,comment,1504569,1504798,0,0,donw,,,"I think that their hiring and internal quality-control process excludes it, actually.<p>For building Google's search engine, you need people who know search and sorting algorithms backwards, forwards, inside-out, and upside down.  You need hardcore A/B testing based on statistical significance, and rigorous respect of the data you collect.<p>To make the iPhone and the iPad, you need neither of those.<p>You need one guy who will walk around like an idiot for months pretending that a deck of cards is his telephone, and writing down every observation and thought that he has on usability.  You need a master craftsman who can direct the entire experience, without losing his head in the tech specs.<p>Google doesn't hire people like that.  Decisions are made by committee, backed by data and research, which gives them their edge in technical excellence, but also cripples them in hardware and marketing.<p>It kills me.  I really want Google to succeed here; Apple has effectively zero competition in the smartphone and tablet market <i>other</i> than Google.<p>Ok, what follows is a bit of a rant. :)<p>Personally, the first thing I'd do with Android is revamp the market and distribution model to standardize the OS across platforms and vendors, so that an Android works the same no matter where you got it.  Vendors can add in custom content (wallpapers, extra apps, ringtones, etc), but the <i>interface</i> (icons, look-and-feel) needs to be the same.<p>The vendors will go with this.  They're getting their asses handed to them by Apple, and Google is their lifeline, because they're saving a ton on development costs.<p>Second, I'd market the hell out of the areas that Apple cant match, but that matter to the consumer, namely voice search, and maybe being able to hold the phone in the human hand without losing reception.<p>And whatever you do, don't play the celebrity card.  Apple's iPhone and iPad ads make it look like you're using the device.  Google could steal a page from that, but with Android devices being used in the real world, not in the Apple cleanroom.",1278817185

Communication overhead is something anyone attempting to understand enterprise software needs to grasp. Omnipresent meetings occur as an individual's defence mechanism. It is a mischaracterisation to treat it as a problem divorced from corporate structure, as they really are two sides to one coin.<p>Holding a meeting keeps a paper trail of your attempts to solve a problem and dilutes responsibility across all those involved. Hence, despite the fact that all participants likely sit within ten metres of each other a meeting will still be scheduled: complete with calendar invites, hour-length time blocks (as less would not look like the issue is being given sufficient credence) and the scheduling of follow-up meetings.<p>Additionally, enterprise projects do not consist of harmonious teams. Each team is akin to a project of its own: each with its own corporate structure, politics, budgets, risks and resources. I recently had a manager from one team demand I attend dual hour-long meetings per day for her team. I politely declined, stating that to do so my team would require an additional resource to cover this gap. This did not ingratiate me.",1278816020

From previous experiences, it drops a little in the beginning, but training smooths the transition. With increased decision freedom due to removed vendor lock-in, governments can both choose the best tool for a given job (even if it's incompatible with, say, MS SQL Server) or develop the missing functionality (because they have access to source code). And governments can cooperate over these developments across regional or national borders. Reduced licensing cost is just the beginning.<p>> especially for information workers who are set in their ways<p>In other words, who can't learn another IDE beyond Visual Studio and other language beyond VB. Oh! Wait! They have to learn a new Visual Studio every couple years. And they had to learn VB.Net (or C#, or managed C++). They already do relearn lots of stuff.<p>And if you have a developer who is not willing to learn, fire him.<p>> OpenOffice is still far behind Office in usability for the average information worker<p>Come on... How many people <i>within Microsoft</i> really stress Words feature-set? 1%? The average ""information worker"" would be perfectly fine with WordStar and Visicalc. Also, it's not like Office 2003 users weren't completely lost when upgraded to 2007 and more so on 2010. The GDP of a decent-sized country was lost on menu repositioning over Office's history.<p>> The savings in license costs is probably outweighed by the long-term productivity hit.<p>Long term productivity hit meaning these workers cannot learn new things?",1278815566

Apple and iPhone<p>etc....<p>It seems like the risk of pursuing perfection is that you become paralyzed, and the risk of doing something no one finds practical is that it contributes nothing to the world.<p>Isn't it better to find a slightly more effective solution that everyone finds they need rather than a perfect solution for a problem no one has?",1278815420

Figure out how much force on the load will result from the torque.<p>5. Once you know force, you'll know how fast the load will accelerate.<p>6. Assume the load accelerates for 0.01 s (or some small time step) and then recalculate all your parameters.<p>7. If it's not fast enough, pick a more powerful motor.<p>Really, you're trying to solve a system of differential equations, so the actual answer might be ""go to engineering school and take a class in dynamics"" or ""find an engineer who will do some system modeling in Matlab for you.""",1278813924

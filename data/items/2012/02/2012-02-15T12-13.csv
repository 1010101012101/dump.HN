That they were able to use these components made it possible to provide an operating system with a nice, well performing GUI running on a stable UNIX foundation.<p>Had NeXTStep only been a warmed over UNIX, wouldn't it have been better for Apple to just use Linux and X11, or even better use A/UX which already had a Mac-like interface?<p>Gruber is not really blaming Gates, he's blaming Isaacson for not doing proper research.

Personally, I don't think the graphs are surprising: first Wikipedia becomes a big hit, and loads of people sign up. Then, as time passes, some people become unactive. In the end, I think we'll still have a pretty large baseline editing Wikipedia.<p>The biggest problem I see with Wikipedia is that it's only reliable as long as you're looking up non-controversial issues. Thus, it's fine when you're looking for definitions and trivia, but when it comes to the interesting stuff - pretty much all of which is controversial, because that's where the good bits of science happen - Wikipedia is horrible. In these cases, it is much better to check out (for example) Google Scholar and search for scientific articles directly.<p>Ah, if only there were an encyclopedia that would directly list all the appropriate references for a given subject.

An iPhone 4S modified to run Android or Windows Phone 7? Or a top-of-the-line HTC, Samsung, or Nokia handset running iOS 5?</i><p>This is a fascinating question to me because though I agree with Gruber on preferring OS X on the PC hardware (for now anyway, at least vs Windows rather than Linux), I think I actually would prefer Android on an iPhone.  My biggest gripe with Android is the shitty hardware and the seeming inability of any manufacturer to make a touch-screen that is not glitchy as fuck all.  When it comes to software I concede iOS has more polish and there tend to be better designed apps.  But on the other hand, Android has the more powerful apps.  For instance, I use DoggCatcher for podcasts on android, and I've tried a half-dozen iOS podcast apps, many of which are more elegant, but they are extremely under powered feature-wise.  Apple's philosophy of only have a home button is elegant serves discoverability, but I don't think it's inherently better, and for power users I think it can be a disadvantage.",1329309811

It's also Jobs' company - and it is what NeXT was probably meant to be.<p>If software were the only priority, OSX (and iOS) would be more modular, easily customizable and extensible - and it would be much more advanced than it is and than what its Unix roots allow it to be. And it would run on PCs since the 286 days (maybe with a decent graphics board). If hardware were the priority, they would have designed their own CPUs, embedded memory management functionality within the memory itself. By now, you would probably be able to SHA1 a block of memory without it ever touching the CPU data bus.<p>Much like a glass cockpit of a plane or your in-car entertainment system, you don't care what OS it runs or what types of CPUs are built into it. A Mac, an iP*d or an iPhone are devices you buy to cover a specific need - you want to write, crunch numbers, make phone calls, read books, listen to music, even write software...

POSIX-based software and DBus-based software took quite different paths in their evolution. so different that they look now like creatures from two different universes. it's always nice to see how devs from GNOME and KDE develop standards that help interoperability. i wish someone would look into interoperability between the gui world and the cli world too. i originally moved to Arch from Ubuntu because the latter looked quite noisy to me - too many desktop components that i never used, to many system resources waisted on activities that i consider useless or harmful. i've created a very minimalistic environment built around some cli tools and a few very simple gui components that didn't depend on a whole desktop. and it worked quite well until it started to fall apart - every program that didn't belong to the cli world tended to either crash or work with some limitations. mostly because of the problems with DBus. most of these problems were caused by differences between the actual DBus interfaces provided and what those programs were expecting to see. and of course there were some missing components that depended on a ton of other components from either GNOME or KDE. so now i'm back to square one - i'm back on Ubuntu and i feel like an alien. most things indeed work out of the box but it's not a linux that i understand, can easily learn, fix and customize myself.",1329309501

3593978,comment,3593134,3593134,1,0,chalst,,,"While I agree with the article that WP is in trouble, I disagree entirely as to what the problem is.  WP is not too bad at the low-level policing part, to do with stopping vandalism, enforcing its biography of living persons policy, &c.<p>It has mostly failed at the higher-level policing mission, of ensuring that those editors who are trying to write articles that are soundly sourced and informative are able to get on with this task without  being harassed by people pushing agendas.  The more value a resource Wikipedia becomes, the more valuable it is to such agenda pushers: cranks, lobbyists, corporate PR, &c, who often can devote considerable energy to this task.<p>For example, the editor FT2, who earned money through his NLP practice, pushed pseudoscientific doctrines on many Wikipedia pages.  he was expert at playing Wikipedia politics, and rose to become a member of Arbcom, and only came unstuck when he abused this position to punish editor Orangemarlin, an editor who campaigned against pseudoscience and who was a nuisance to FT2.<p>The way WP now works is that the enforcement of the low-level policing is done at the expense of the higher-level issue of neutrality.  By playing the politics well, as FT2 did, agenda pushers can use the WP rules to waste the time and wear down the patience of good content editors.  I left WP following the fiasco of the Arbcom ruling against Peter Damian.<p>Ed Buckner wrote an excellent summary of the problem with agenda pushers in <i>Skeptica Adsversaria</i> (apologies: the formatting in this copy is awful 400px left and right margin hard coded into every paragraph: OK if you have a very wide screen or can overide the margin somehow):  <a href=""http://www.btinternet.com/~musicweaver/wikipedia-by-ed-buckner-ASKE.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.btinternet.com/~musicweaver/wikipedia-by-ed-buckn...</a>",1329309323

I was about to type a post offering the counter example, New York (specifically Manhattan) and to some extent Chicago. Both are products of a strong ""framework"" of transit and utilities, but the growth within this framework has been more or less organic...all buildings don't have to be the same height a la Paris.<p>I've felt that organically grown cities, of which most major European cities are good examples, are very sub-optimal for because of the haphazard and random way the cities are laid out. It many such cities, the old, medieval core became so bogged down that cars aren't even allowed and it's basically a pedestrian heaven.<p>Navigation is hard in these cities, traffic is usually a mess without modern development to route around the ""organicness"" of the city centers, as a result certain types of goods and services...namely anything to do with lots of manufacturing or bulk goods, ends up moving away from the city core. And while it means that the cores tends to become very pedestrian friendly, they really just sort of end up as extended outdoor shopping malls with some housing for the shop workers above.<p>It's interesting in some of the older Asian cities which have very old histories, say Seoul, the the haphazard, medieval-style organic planning has given way to a large effort to put the major thoroughfares on a grid and as old areas are redeveloped, to do so with a heavily planned development policy in mind. The city was simply not able to handle the growth and population demands the organic system created.<p>There's a reason Paris' business center is not in Paris' geographic center, and central London has restricted driving zones, and most of Barcelona's population enjoys the 19th century planned developed residential areas, while the older parts are being turned into tourist hotels, malls, restaurants and more shopping areas.",1329308044

The act defines a trade secret as ""all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or <i>engineering information, including</i> patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, <i>programs, or codes, whether tangible or intangible</i> and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if the owner has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret, and the information derives independent economic value (actual or potential) from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, the public. The act defines owner as ""the person or entity in whom or in which <i>rightful legal or equitable title to, or license in</i>, the trade secret is reposed.<p>So: regardless of what sophomoric opinions you have about copying music, copying trade secrets really is, in black letter federal law, theft.",1329307373

For all he knows, a lawyer would have told him that it's a totally empty threat and he shouldn't worry about it.

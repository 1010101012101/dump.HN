This is, to be honest, a pretty extreme idea if taken literally.<p>Or you could deem salesmen, 911 conspirators, trolls and homeopathy proponents as &quot;crazy and confused&quot;, but who decides that?

9874284,comment,9873732,9873732,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> The paper illustrates the point by undertaking two different RCTs on cowpea seeds in Tanzania. One is a traditional study where the control group knows they are getting traditional seeds and the treatment group knows they are getting modern seeds. The second is double blind; neither group knows what seed it is getting.<p>> The traditional RCT shows a significant  over 20% increase in yields from the modern seed. But the double blind RCT shows that virtually all of that improvement comes from changed behavior<p>> Specifically, the average treatment effect in the double blind RCT was zero! And when the harvests in the control groups across the two RCTs were compared, the blind control group showed a significant over 20% increase over the traditional RCT control group which knew they were getting the traditional seeds.<p>> In other words, the significant effect found in the traditional RCT was not due to better seeds, it was due to actions taken by the farmers who thought they were getting better seeds (they planted them in larger plots with more space between the plants on better quality land). These farmers&#x27; expectations were wrong (in post experiment surveys, over 60% of them said they were disappointed in the yields)<p>I don&#x27;t like this reporting. The way things are phrased, it looks like Tanzanian farmers have depressed yields 17% just by having bad farming practices. But it goes on to specifically say that the farmers were disappointed in their 20% increased yields.<p>The most sense I can make of this is that these experiments both measured yield per seed rather than something useful like yield per acre -- despite the fact that the farmers being studied clearly considered this irrelevant. Are seeds really such a major cost in farming? Was the study just terribly designed?",1436723947

9874281,comment,9873814,9873814,0,0,brudgers,,,"Four years ago, I noticed that the Pan Am Games were on ESPN Deportes [the Spanish Language version of ESPN in the US] and I realized that at some point between the early 1980&#x27;s and 2011, the games had basically slipped entirely out of the sports narrative in the US. The Pan Am Games used to be a big deal with prime-time network coverage. Yet somehow the US sports broadcasting industry has decided that video of someone doing a radio broadcast is better  content than actual international competition by elite athletes.<p>This despite more than a ten fold proliferation of cable sports networks. The Gold Cup has better coverage. Professional lacrosse has better coverage. The NBA off season has better coverage.<p>And then I read the article and I realize, it perhaps may be only by force of will that  ESPN Deportes broadcasts the games, so thick does the stupidity of the games&#x27; organizers appear.

-Quantify your personal time investment: add up the value of the time you&#x27;ve put in, including opportunity cost. If you didn&#x27;t build this company, what could you have earned doing consulting?
-Quantify your traction: if this includes revenue from customers, project how much those customers will earn for your company over the next few years and add that to the total value of the company.<p>Good luck!",1436723205

You don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s fair or what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.<p>Now, having said that, you have to determine your goals and how to synthesize an ideal set of negotiating levels.<p>Typically these levels are:<p><pre><code>  1.  Possible Best Case
  2.  Likely negotiated agreement
  3.  Worse you&#x27;ll take (walk away below)
  4.  BATNA - Your &quot;Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement.&quot;
</code></pre>
There are several methods used for calculating acqui-hire or acquisition:<p><pre><code>  1.  Comparables on metrics such as revenue, profit, market share, impressions, downloads, average daily/monthly users
  2.  The company&#x27;s (buyer)&#x27;s budget - &quot;Well all we have is this&quot;
  3.  The sellers demands (I won&#x27;t sell for less than this)
</code></pre>
If I were looking at buying you, I&#x27;d consider it fair if I Can &quot;buy&quot; you for less than you&#x27;ll make me, including opportunity costs.<p>You&#x27;re going to have give out more (anonymous) details before most people can help you too much:<p><pre><code>  1.  Are you a 1-man shop?  Including contractors?
  2.  How many people at acquirer?
  3.  How long have to both been in business?
  4.  How much revenue do you both have?  How much profit?
  5.  What guarantees do you want if you&#x27;re hired?  What agreements are you willing to make (i.e. non-compete)
</code></pre>
If you&#x27;re a one man shop with an app that&#x27;s generated $30k this year, I&#x27;d buy you for $60k and pay you $140k with a non-compete for 2 years.  I don&#x27;t know if you thin that&#x27;s fair, but it would be to me.<p>Remember, a negotiation is a game in which both people agree things are fair, or both people agree that they get screwed equally.<p>After the negotiation, if you have to work with the person, then try to focus on the former case.",1436722743

The proof is readily examinable from the site.<p>The subreddits with greater representation (beyond young, white, and male) are all heavily moderated around-the-clock - e.g.,: askhistorians, iAMA, askscience. They are also unsurprisingly the only subreddits that aren&#x27;t actively embarrassing when exposed to the outside world.<p>Meanwhile the laissez-faire subreddits are absolute cesspools in the comments - e.g.,: worldnews, videos, funny... The white supremacist subreddits routinely raid the comment sections of posts (particularly anything relating to black men) with impunity.<p>Reddit isn&#x27;t just a good example of what happens when unfettered free speech is prioritized above the safety of individual users, it&#x27;s also a good example of what happens when there is active community leadership and the willingness to shut down the most toxic members of a community. It shows brilliantly the results of years of completely unrestrained free speech vs. moderated speech, and I think the results speak for themselves.<p>The problem is IMO twofold:<p>- Reddit the corporation profits (or at least tries to) off of the hate speech that, while largely practiced by only a small minority of the userbase, is commonly found throughout its site, not just the dark corners.<p>- The existence of these hate communities on Reddit without rebuke, censure, or in fact <i>any</i> consequence, creates more work for the already-overworked and unpaid moderators. White supremacist communities (among other hate communities on Reddit) are emboldened to post their shit far and wide, well beyond the confines of their own communities. Reddit&#x27;s tolerant attitude towards hate groups on its site actively makes the site worse for everyone else, and massively increases the workload of unpaid volunteers who are already frustrated at poor tools and lack of support from site owners.<p>As a side note: I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any disagreement that moderation is fraught with dangers, and that drawing the line between acceptable content vs. unacceptable content will be exceedingly difficult in many cases.

Or at least human scale - since it is you who are doing the choosing.<p>Hmm, my intent was to expressly claim those things at large scales, or more accurately, at all scales.  It&#x27;s just that it is easier for us to understand e.g. the organization and benevolence only in the things which are of the most immediate usefulness: we understand the biosphere as a resource because we can use that <i>now</i>, whereas we don&#x27;t really understand how to harness the full power of a star because it&#x27;s too far beyond our current capabilities.<p>> Earth&#x27;s biosphere is nurturing agar, no doubt, over a short time scale and small space scale. But the solar system, galaxy, let alone the universe at large, is most definitely not, and nor is the Earth&#x27;s biosphere on any large time scale.<p>I agree with you about Earth&#x27;s biosphere space-wise though perhaps not time-wise.  But if Earth is a cradle of intelligent life, surely we are not meant to stay here indefinitely?  Even now the wild idea of mining asteroids, once relegated to science fiction, is reaching the point of feasibility.  What was previously useless (not to mention unknown) to us is becoming useful, and will act as a stepping stone (or a catapult) to enable some other far-fetched ideas to come closer to manifestation.  I believe this is a pattern that does not necessarily end.<p>> If there is intelligent life elsewhere, we are separated by impossible vastness: to get to another star, in any form, we must harness immense energy. More than is reasonable. And once there, the lifeboat must somehow found a colony, a self-sustaining biosphere, which itself is a gargantuan task.<p>There was a time, or more accurately various times for various peoples, that crossing an ocean was almost beyond imagination.  As we continue to gain in knowledge and understanding of how the universe works, especially our understanding of spacetime, these problems become far less intractable.  Interstellar travel is just a bigger ocean.  The scale of the metaphor is logarithmic but so is the pace of the growth of our collective intelligence.  My personal belief is that we will find a way around the immense time and energy requirements that we currently believe are necessary for interstellar travel.  Terraforming is the harder problem: understanding ecosystems is IMO orders of magnitude harder than understanding fundamental physics, and building them from scratch seems like a pipe dream even for a dreamer like me.  But if we figure out how to travel smarter then it becomes more a question of finding the most Earth-like planets that already have much or most of what we need.  Still not easy, but probably easier and faster than trying to terraform Mars.<p>> Perhaps, though, this is a benevolent universe: maybe those great chasms of space protect intelligences from each other.<p>This seems plausible to me also.  Seeds need a volume to grow in that is often tens of millions times larger than the seed itself.  There could be a cosmic ecosystem that we are still too young to see or understand, and we may not catch a glimpse of it until we have spread through the stars.<p>> There is hope for long-term survival of intelligence, but it is very, very small.<p>If you mean small hope for human intelligence, then I would agree.  I think this has less to do with the harshness of the universe out there and more to do with our own species&#x27; maladaptive behavior patterns.  We are in a species-scale moment of crisis, which is to say one that has been going on for hundreds or thousands of years and may last a few hundred more, but there&#x27;s no question in my mind that we need to get our shit together <i>now</i> if we want the species (and/or its children) to survive.  This is why I think it is important to view the universe through a lens of possibility: it gives us a direction to steer towards.  A more hopeful outlook inspires activity to push towards a better outcome.<p>Thanks for responding!",1436721265

And if you&#x27;re careful to do all the other things you need to do in order to make this work and safe, as seen in the other messages in this post.<p>Practically, all the examples I&#x27;ve ever of why you&#x27;d ever want a singleton are indeed better done as a goroutine server over channels. Within the object you get an implicit lock by virtue of being the only goroutine ever to touch that stuff, and as long as you don&#x27;t need this object to use more than one CPU total and the overhead of channels isn&#x27;t a big deal, which again, describes the vast bulk of cases I&#x27;ve ever heard of that call for singletons, it&#x27;s a better way to go.<p>And I&#x27;d note I&#x27;ve written a couple dozen different goroutine server things and a grand total of 0 &#x27;singletons&#x27;, so... yeah.<p>If I had an immutable singleton object that was somehow very expensive to initialize, I might consider this approach.

Is it me, or does this need come up rarely in practice <i>relative to the forcefulness of arguments to make everything immutable</i>? I get that it depends on your project, etc. But, I&#x27;m talking overall.<p>There are other benefits to immutability, to be sure, but I appear to be the rare voice that finds the dictum to &quot;make everything immutable&quot; to be overstated. And, we seem to ignore the code bloat that comes along with it--builders and the like, as well as performance implications.<p>Of course we solve the challenges that mutability can introduce by lopping it off altogether, but at what cost? It&#x27;s really not too far from solving problems that object misuse can introduce by getting rid of objects.<p>Replace all setters with builders, annotations, etc. Do not ever change an object&#x27;s state. Ever! Run this Mutability Detector on your code to ensure you are not allowing something to be mutable. At all costs, kill those language features that allow object state to be changed!<p>At what point have we jumped the shark?<p>Maybe others believe in moderation as do I, and I just happen to be reading more of the forceful champions of immutability lately.

Also depends on your definition of Native.<p>First Native can mean a lot of things in Android Land. For instance you mention Xamarin and React Native. Both of those are generating actual native binaries (googles byte code version of Java byte code) or rather React Native for android will when it&#x27;s actually a thing, it&#x27;s not released yet but should be somewhat soon. They are both a way of writing Native code in another language (C#, Js) rather like Scalriod let&#x27;s you write a native Android App in Scala. The are a fundamentally different approach than Ionic or PhoneGap which are HTML5/JS/CSS based webapps that are packaged to be app-like. Also in android development Native is sometimes used to refer to C++ ndk development. Go is also being used sometimes (go 1.5 needed to support it) for native (meaning cpu native binary instead of byte code) code.<p>If you plan on being a Mobile developer as your day job than I say absolutely. If I&#x27;m hiring a dedicated Android dev, I&#x27;d expect that they are an expert in Android Java. Bonus points for knowing C++ ndk or Go ndk development because then I&#x27;m not really restricted as to what I could ask them to do on the platform. Some things like converting video in real time or intense calculations will absolutely require ndk level of performance.<p>If your app is mostly using a rest api or collecting form data, then ndk is way overkill. Rather it&#x27;s a native experience depends on your goal. If you want the latest in Android API&#x27;s or features or you want the smoothest most native feeling app, then Java is really the only choice. If you are more concerned about sharing code with and iOS project then Xamarin or soon React Native are the best choices. Lastly if all you really care about is having an &quot;app&quot; for a SaaS or other webapp then PhoneGap or Ionic would be a valid choice. For me I&#x27;d never use them but I&#x27;d rather have a great app or no app at all. I would consider Xamarin or React Native though, I think the user experience is close enough to a standard sdk app on both platforms that if you aren&#x27;t a mobile game or mobile app based startup that it is probably good enough. Games are exception in that, there are a ton of cross platform options that are awesome. Unreal, Unity, Cocos, even phonegap or ionic packaging up a html5 game engine like phaser are all very good choices.",1436720948

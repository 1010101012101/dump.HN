In germany you tend to get paid more* for your work and have more time to complete your work because it&#x27;s expected that you deliver quality. Meanwhile outsourced work is paid little and expected quickly, so foreign workers (especially east-european) have little incentive or reason to improve their work quality and even if they care, have little opportunity to do so. (No time to actually read &quot;Perl Best Practices&quot; when some german manager wants the work done &#x27;now&#x27;.) Added to that there&#x27;s also the fact that higher education in germany is for all intents and purposes free, adding just another early education edge for people here.<p>* higher wages all around, illegal to work without health insurance, law-mandated minimum paid vacation (24 days), all (real) sick days fully paid",1418455190

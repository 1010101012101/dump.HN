I think the most important ones are the issues with the speed of taking orders and the suggestion to talk to local restaurants and bars for input.<p>My two cents are related to the video. It looks too amateurish. The camera is not 100% steady (use a tripod, or set the camera on a table), the narration is not very fluid (practice, practice, practice) and it's too technical. The video should target your audience and highlight the advantage of using your system. Show a waiter taking orders, and the kitchen receiving them instantly. Show how a fast and easy it is to print receipts and how a manager can help resolve customer issues/complaints. How would you convince a restaurant owner to ditch the multi-thousand $$ POS system that he/she has, and invest in yours?<p>Also your FAQ page seems to be outdated and missing a few links.<p>Good luck!",1304365721

That is a number system where .1 can't be accurately represented. How often do you use .1 in your calculations? He has a couple of examples of 34 digit precision which is representable in a 128 bit quantity. (3.7 bits per digit). Straight BCD would of course be 32 digits minus the digits which represent the exponent.<p>I wrote some CAD routines once that used decimal arithmetic rather than binary and was amazed at how much better it worked in terms of edges lining up and when you approximate non-square surfaces you get much better tesselation.<p>And of course for history buffs the IBM 1620 used decimal as a native representation for numbers.

2507497,comment,2507402,2507402,5,0,prat,,,"These are my first impressions on reading this and parts of other linked articles in it. My opinions are fallible and often change over time.<p>First, being in the field and a part of the teams that first published the general human genome and the individual human genome, I know that our current knowledgebase of genomic variant <-> disease correlation is not very vast. We don't even know how much more or less important are the particular type of variants ""SNPs"" that personal genomics companies mostly mine, in comparison with other types (Insertion/deletions , structural variations, copy number). 
At more serious genomics research institutes, we are still trying to figure out the genetic pathways that might be affected by this mutation or that - far from actually predicting their effects on actual physical condition. So does that mean personal genomic companies are far ahead of institutes in their research? I am not so sure.<p>Second, I think we need regulation here for the same reasons that we need net neutrality. I wouldn't be surprised if with time, the reports start advising you on which of the alternative drugs would be most beneficial for your genotype and disease. I would still be okay with it if companies like 23andme published their research or atleast cited publications - but I am not sure they believe in public access when it comes to their findings. (I can be wrong on that - so correct me if you know better)<p>Finally, I actually like the prospect of public driven science in addition to just organization/scientist driven, as that is likely to fund some actual science in addtion to pseudo science. So one solution I can think of is for FDA to approve a most trusted mutation screen for all these personal genomic companies to abide by. Let them focus on their core competency which is sequencing and customer interface and not research, If however they come across findings that might be beneficial, let them publish it in a peer-reviewed journal and apply to FDA to add it to the universal mutation screen.",1304364660

We have a hustler, and hacker/hustler and a hacker as founders.

He will stay on and help but we are looking for a tech cofounder to go ""all in"" with us. We are self-funded for now.<p>What we are building:We will give private beta invites to anyone who is interested in learning more about joining us but we would rather keep our product private for now...we don't think it's ready to be shown to HN :) What I can say is that it's a web application (HTML4/5 w/ jQuery) with a custom PHP/MySQL backend using PHP5 PDO, Pear and Zend packages, hosted on an AWS EC2 farm (mostly custom configured 64-bit Ubuntu servers) managed via Scalr. I know this description is not informative at all but we can provide more info for people who are interested.<p>Who we are looking for: A tech cofounder looking to help build a startup. This cofounder should be ready to go all in with us on this idea and be willing to come to SF if we get accepted to YC. The perfect candidate will have experience with all of the technologies listed above. We want someone who loves dev and just as importantly loves this industry.

I was very pleasantly surprised when visiting Chicago, Seattle, Berlin, Brussels: these are world class cities where transportation is a breeze, average food quality is amazing (although, San Francisco still wins out on the ""high""-end dining options). This was quite a shock from growing up in Former USSR and then moving to California (where San Francisco and Los Angeles were my example of ""cities"").<p>However, there's good reason I am here in Silicon Valley. Athens at the time of Pericles and Socrates wasn't a great place to live either, far worse than Silicon Valley. Same goes late Republican and early imperial Rome, Tang dynasty Xi'an,  Florence and Venice during the Renaissance, Victorian London, etc... On the other hand, people willingly sacrificed their standard of living and prestige to live in these cities and and pursue activities they found meaningful. Being a big fish in a small, provincial ponds sucks: if you want to grow intellectually or professionally, you should be around smart and ambitious people.<p>To be fair, there are pockets of talent elsewhere (New York, Seattle) but they're generally rather insular: a lot of the places tend to be a combination of a revolving door for some (people joining and leaving in 18 months, very frequently moving to Silicon Valley) and a life long commitment for others (lifetime ""softies"" at Microsoft). While exceptional talent does exist in many place outside of Silicon Valley, the stories of people joining a company, staying long enough to make a significant impact and then applying their lessons elsewhere (e.g., the ""Fairchildren"", ""Paypal Mafia"", Xooglers) are not as common in less-fluid engineering job markets.",1304363255

It looks like you're using nearly all stock UIKit widgets (default buttons, default tableviews, default split view controller, etc.) and the problem is that this type of app needs to be head and shoulders above the POS apps that waiters and restaurant works are used to which are mostly just grids of buttons. You've traded grids of buttons with rows of buttons instead of attacking the usability and user experience head on with a gorgeous, custom interface that totally blows away what's already out there.<p>This type of app will live and die by demos that you give restaurant owners. It needs to blow people away at first glance, especially waiters. Because you used all stock UIKit elements, at first glance it looks like it could be anything. I really think it needs an amazing interface to stand out from the crowd and blow people away.<p>Edit: I'd also suggest going to some local restaurants & bars and talking to people there who'd be using this app. Get their information and tell them you'll pay them $50 for 30 minutes of their time whenever they're free. Meet up with them and ask them their gripes about current POS systems, record this audio conversation (with their consent). Have them talk about the top things that they hate and the top things they wished it would do. Ask about what they spend the majority of their time on when using POS systems and which parts of the system fail the most often or are most frequently misinterpreted by the cooks or other waiters.

They're already partial, else they wouldn't be investing.)<p>To quote Arrington, ""Theres a period of time with any investment when I know an investment is possible or likely but it cant be announced yet. During that time I dont write about the startup at all, because I cant disclose the investment.

The way it works (if you don't want to read the code), is you add a decorator to a function that you want to run asynchronously.  When you run the function, it returns a promise object which runs the function in a separate thread (or process).  When you use the promise object, it acts as a proxy to the actual object.  So you can use operators on it and call functions that the object has.  The way I did operator proxying at the moment is currently messy, and I advice on how to do it better would be appreciated.<p>You can look at the code: http://codepad.org/yf9Cz45a , but please don't steal =)  Although, do tell me if it's worth stealing.

267272,comment,267212,267259,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"But completely unrelated ideas don't spawn the kind of creativity that is really useful.  The point is that you want a lot of conversation on a particular topic, and some ""accidents"" to occur within those conversations.  If the topic is ""doing stuff with computers,"" then you'll have more computer-related creativity coming out of a place that has a lot of computer ideas bumping into one another.<p>This article falls into the ""why are hubs hubs?"" category.<p>Not to nitpick, but how could there be ""unusually large numbers"" of anything ""all over the world""?  What's so unusual about that large number, if it's everywhere?",1217922238

267269,comment,267170,267222,0,0,swombat,,,"An MBA makes a high middle-class income quite likely - you'll probably be one of those people earning 6-figure salaries - but it's unlikely to result in a large lump sum payment, which is a more likely way to become very rich.<p>So, MBAs will probably accumulate a few millions over their working life, if they're good at managing their money, but they're unlikely to find themselves with $5m at 35.",1217922071
267268,comment,267049,267049,0,0,dmnd,,,"I really like the idea. A few things I noticed:<p>Tagging a conversation with a pronoun like ""I"" will probably means it sticks around forever.<p>Can you join multiple conversations at once? What happens if two conversations share a tag? Are they merged?<p>To stop conversations being tagged incorrectly, you could perhaps ask users that join via that tag if it was accurate or not.<p>It'd be awesome if you could automate tagging of conversations. I'm not sure how many people will be motivated to maintain metadata about their conversations (the only way to find that out is to get more users though).",1217922017

For an MD to reach that point, he has to start a very successful practice or make some good investments to go along with his income.

267263,comment,266657,266868,0,0,netcan,,,"""The problem is that online news isn't really free -- it requires funding from the dying offline business because online news doesn't have a viable business model.""<p>Very True. An online reader is just not worth much. Even if they do get you onto their site.<p>""Successful news providers in the future will need to start with a much cheaper cost structure to match a much lower revenue model. ""
The business model might just be collapsing. And that does not necessarily mean a new one takes its place. I mean I can't take the 'new music business models' (t shirts and personalised songs & stuff) seriously. Sometimes industries collapse. Print news might be one of them.<p>""Successful news providers in the future will need to start with a much cheaper cost structure to match a much lower revenue model""<p>How about 0 cost (99% of blogs) & 0 direct revenue. BTW, for writer I think the alternative business model is more feasible. Books, appearances, lectures etc. A good few big name journalists could pull this off. Quite a few bloggers (in the business blogging field at least) do.",1217921282

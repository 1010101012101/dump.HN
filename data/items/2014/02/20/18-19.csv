I know some people who do live in the Montrose area (rapidly rising price), and they do so by putting 3 single developers in one house.  Once you get married, that becomes less attractive, and you end up forced out of the loop (like we did) - I&#x27;m in the process of buying a house conveniently located under 5 minutes from work just inside BW8, and I still can&#x27;t walk there - doing so would require crossing the Beltway at high traffic times, and I don&#x27;t care to greatly increase my risk of death five days a week.<p>I&#x27;m actually a big proponent of public transportation and increased options for travel, and am really glad when they get implemented, but purely for selfish reasons - it means less people on the roads.  I&#x27;ll gladly pay a bit more in taxes to make the roads less of a logjam at most hours of the day.",1392922797

No. I should have skipped Microsoft stack entirely. I say this after 12 years of .Net and a previous 6 years of COM/C++/Win32. It has been the universally most stressful platform to work on.

It took a half hour to an hour to get anywhere at all, but it was definitely necessary.<p>What I&#x27;m specifically referring to is that once you&#x27;re in an urban center, is it more like a European or even an older American (pre-car) city where you can walk locally, public transit outside of that and <i>then</i> drive, or is it like Houston, LA or Dallas? Where the difference between living in the &quot;city&quot; and living in the country is that it shaves half the time off your drive to get anywhere and you <i>have</i> to drive to accomplish even basic daily tasks like grocery shopping?<p>LA is the quintessential example where urban planners decided to build around the car and invested heavily in freeway infrastructure instead of robust public transport (and the urban development model that implies). Building cities around vehicles and not around people (as has been done for millenia) <i>is</i> the experiment I&#x27;m talking about, and I think it&#x27;s proven to not be the better model.<p>I think it can swing wrong the other way as well. Building only on the scale for people to walk around causes friction with entering or leaving the urban &quot;zone&quot;. If you want to go visit a city, you have no place to put your car, this hurts the economy of the city. And if you want to leave the city, maybe for a trip, or to pick up a bulk good you can&#x27;t hand carry, you may not have a car to do so (this is partially addressed by services like zipcar and similar).",1392922174

The arctic ice in question is largely ice sitting atop water. Thus the feedback mechanism described in the article. Light colored ice thins, darker water is exposed to sunlight to warm and thin more ice or not freeze as rapidly the next winter.<p>See a similar effect in Greenland as pollution (mostly from North America?) is covering the ice sheet with a darker soot, leading to heating of the ice sheet and faster than normal melts.<p>The Antarctic is sitting away from pollution and the ice sheet is largely atop a landmass, not just water. In particular, the central ice sheet is on land. So any water warming affect would be going outside-in, not inside-out. No internal feedback loop to destroy itself. Regarding pollution, as a contrast to Greenland, its air currents aren&#x27;t pulling in heavily polluted air from industrial centers and setting it down on the ice sheet.<p>Why it&#x27;s grown? I haven&#x27;t got a clue, but why it hasn&#x27;t shrunk like the Arctic? It&#x27;s not the same configuration, it shouldn&#x27;t be expected to react the same way.",1392922100

Of course it can, that&#x27;s the whole purpose of psychology (and, more fashionably, neuroscience of course).  To me that sounds like saying <i>science</i> can&#x27;t answer these questions.  Do note that when I say &quot;psychology&quot; I mean strictly the scientific areas of whatever comes in the bag labelled &quot;psychology&quot;.  Due to historical accidents the term acquired a lot of BS pseudo-scientific baggage, and it&#x27;s really a shame those things can detract from a wealth of valuable hard results honest scientific psychology uncovered.<p>The answer that developmental cognitive psychology, at least the theory I&#x27;m referring to, gives is that &quot;the mind&quot; comes from the only place it can come from: neural processes and the way they hook into environmental interactions of the organism (social and physical).  The key to understanding what gives rise to &quot;consciousness&quot; is in understanding the role of language acquisition in broader cognitive development.  The point where a child utters it&#x27;s first words is neither the beginning nor the end of this extremely nuanced process.  In my first post I took it for granted it&#x27;s understood that this is not just armchair speculation, it&#x27;s based on empirical data.  As any good scientific theory it&#x27;s far from complete, maybe in some details is inaccurate but it&#x27;s certainly infinitely better that an endless philosophical debate (with strong religious, or in the best case idealist, undertones) on what the mind is and where it comes from.",1392921346

The only way to know whether or not one thing may affect anything else is to simulate it.<p>How could you know the sphere of causality without simulating everything?<p>An object&#x27;s light cone is not a property of the object; it is the result of the properties of the object as they related to the light shining on that object. If the source of that light isn&#x27;t represented in a simulation, then unless that object produces the light itself, the object must be dark or the simulation isn&#x27;t accurate.<p>The discussion is about simulating a universe. Unless there are truly discrete systems within that universe, you can&#x27;t do that simulation within a limited frame.<p>I think what the author was alluding to, though, was to say that the actual rendering of the view, rather than the calculation of the view, would be limited to the current frame of reference.",1392920900

It&#x27;s just a 2-3 minute drive for me to get to a grocery store, a movie theater, restaurants, and museums.<p>But I&#x27;m unmarried with no dependents. I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy a home here (they&#x27;re seemingly all $1M+).<p>As a consequence, with a city the size of Houston, simply increasing the density probably does not have the desired effect. The urban core of Houston will be completely re-invented in the next decade. It will consist almost exclusively of only two groups: (1) the rich; (2) the well-off singles and DINKs (dual-income-no-kids). If you&#x27;re not a successful lawyer, doctor, executive, or someone with pre-existing land ownership, you will never be able to own a home in inner-city Houston in 10 years (barring some economic crash). Even now, it takes two highly paid engineers to comfortably support a family life in many inner-loop areas. Moreover, very few new single-family homes are being built--it&#x27;s almost exclusively townhomes intended for childless young professionals.<p>Everybody else will be pushed to the suburbs, which will actually greatly exacerbate the traffic problem and further insulate the vast majority of kids from urban life.<p>This is why I&#x27;m of the opinion that it would actually be better for everybody if more emphasis were put on suburban development. Make the suburbs less suburban, provide them with more infrastructure, create more walkable centers in them, and also invest more in providing public transportation from the suburbs into downtown business districts. There are already a few park-and-ride bus services (e.g., from Sugar Land or the Woodlands into Downtown, Greenway, etc.), but most suburbanites, so caught up in the car culture, won&#x27;t swallow their pride and use them.",1392920312

It may even shift costs regressively, to products predominately consumed by those with lower incomes, in which case the poor are subsidizing the better off.<p>BUT IT&#x27;S WORSE...<p>We end up paying a lot more than if we just paid for our content and services straight up. Not only are you still paying for the costs of the &quot;free website&quot;, you are paying for all that advertising overhead, the costs of advertising technology and infrastructure (huge, btw), the agency and creative costs (Don Draper and company have to pay for the hookers and scotch somehow, not to mention what’s-his-name who basically just lounges in his office barefoot thinking Japanese), and big marketing departments that often outnumber the people who actually write or make things.<p>You are also paying the opportunity cost of inferior product, because that’s what happens when websites have to design to please advertisers over pleasing us, the users.

So when someone says to you, &quot;Don&#x27;t dwell, release!&quot; there is no frame of reference to even understand what that means. To you, they are meaningless platitudes -- regardless of whether the person speaking to you has those skills or not. But for folks who have experienced this, it is obvious. It is obvious because the word obvious stems from the same word as &quot;observable&quot;. (It is interesting you took the word &quot;obvious&quot; and filtered it to apply your emotional response to it, probably something along the lines of, &quot;you are stupid because you cannot even perceive this&quot;; for me, the intent and emotional content at the time I wrote this was more along the lines of, &quot;yes, it can be this easy too, you should try it, don&#x27;t think too much about it&quot;).<p>Most people are emotional morons. That is not an insult. That is exactly what most people are: confused and unskilled with emotions. If anything, it is a cause for compassion, not a means by which someone can feel better about themselves by being &quot;better&quot; than someone else. It also does not mean someone will stay like that forever. Like all skills, you can develop this, though it takes effort.<p>Most people avoid painful emotions. Part of their subconscious dwells on there. It stays there because they do not want to surface it to the consciousness allow themselves to really <i>experience</i> that feeling, and allow it to fade on its own once it surfaces. Feeling insulted or offended, or feeling offended on behalf of someone else are examples of this dynamic in play.<p>Usually, if something like that surfaces, and the person tries to shunt off the suffering onto someone else as quickly as possible. One typical and popular method of shunting off suffering is a process called &quot;blame&quot;. Our justice system, in fact, is not really about justice so much as divying up blame, that is, divying up suffering among the people. That kind of stuff persists, as each person passes blame on to the next person. It may also take the form of abuse and assault. It may also take the form of more subtle things -- little revenge, or rationalizations. Sometimes, the person isn&#x27;t fully aware of it, since the misery is so intense, it blocks out whatever it is that is surfacing.<p>Even more subtly is when those emotions shapes and changes your thought pattern, and you think you are being reasonable. But you&#x27;re not. Anytime someone has those hidden agendas, they speak or act in one way while trying to get at something else, this dynamic is at play.<p>Usually, when I teach someone these skills, we&#x27;d work on what is being experienced right now. If this were a real-time conversation in meatspace, we would be talking about the emotional impulses within you that led to the downvote. It would be easier in meatspace, since I would be able to tell when things start getting sidetracked, like turning this into a drama about @hosh vs. @lsc rather than what is arising right now. Since this is not meatspace, by the time you read this comment, the arising feelings would likely be different.<p>If you&#x27;re truly impeccable about that bit about wanting a serious conversation about this, PM me privately. Indirect means of contact are in my profile. Alternatively, send me your contact info and we can go from there.",1392919432

Well &quot;pre-tax&quot; means before the government gets their cut.  In Canada, a high income earner gets taxed roughly 40% of their income and we all pay our mortgages/rent/utilities with post-tax money, so the affordability figure goes up over 100%.  That means your entire paycheque is going towards paying for detached housing [2].<p>IIRC, in the US, you are allowed to deduct your mortgage interest from your income, meaning you get to pay with pre-tax income.  But in Canada that is not allowed and you must pay the piper first.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/pdf/HA-1127-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/pdf/HA-1127-2013.pdf</a><p>[2] Condos are at 42% affordability in Vancouver, which is still disastrously high since it is also using pre-tax income.<p>edit: 42% for condos, not 47%.<p>edit 2: corrected to say mortgage interest is deductible from income, based on reply.

I live on a small island of a few 1000 people. It would be brilliant to extend the sense of community with basic services like a marketplace, events etc. It kind of reminds me of using CB radios in the UK in the early 90s, communicating with local people only.<p>Is there any defacto hardware out there that one can buy to start the mesh, without a huge setup, that I could then set up for a couple of neighbours without hassle who then automatically join the mesh? For something like this to take off it&#x27;ll need to be as simple as picking up a router off the shelf and reading a few lines of a manual.",1408946365

I don&#x27;t envision it as a replacement for PNG, which has features Sxz isn&#x27;t designed for, gamma correction, CRC, built in compression, fast encoding and more.<p>An image with a hole allows it&#x27;s other pixels to not have to carry an extra byte to render transparency allowing for good compression for oddly shaped images.  Same reason Sxz supports paletted images with more than 256 colors, hopefully allowing for greater potential compression where PNG and WebP switch over to TrueColor.  Most corporate logos use 256 colors and a white background.  Why not just remove the background and increase the quality of the image with more colors?<p>SVG isn&#x27;t pixel perfect like PNG.  Amongst icon content creators, they avoid SVG in order to have precision.  Although SVG has good integration with a browser&#x27;s DOM, while PNG and JPG are merely data blobs.  Since Sxz breaks down to chunks, it can potentially be parsed by browsers into DOM nodes allowing CSS interaction.<p>The target audience would be game developers in highly constrained bandwidth markets such as mobile and browser based games and want PNG&#x27;s precision with additional features and don&#x27;t mind the slow encoding.<p>I will generate more documentation if there is continued interest.",1408944341

There are 2.5 million mobile users in New Zealand putting total number of iPhones at 750,000.<p>Hang on a second, at $105 tax on each phone, shouldn&#x27;t they have paid tax of a total $78.8bn in New Zealand?<p>But to-date, the amount of tax Apple Corporation has paid in New Zealand is.. $27m<p>Don&#x27;t you think there&#x27;s something wrong with those numbers?<p>Oh wait no, because ACTUALLY Apple is just a company setup in Bermuda who pays other companies to make the phones and sells them internationally at 30% profit with no tax.

I agree, you may get more users wanting to participate and &quot;stick&quot; with a module if you make the modules smaller and even more up to the user&#x27;s leisure. By virtue of making things smaller, you make completing an individual unit &quot;easier.&quot; I think if your goal is to have a higher &quot;completion rate&quot; per &quot;unit of education&quot; the sure that solves it. However, that is not an interesting metric in and of itself.<p>That being said, I think MOOCs definitely have their place; I just don&#x27;t think they displace traditional universities. More often than not, I think for very engaged students, they complement an existing traditional student&#x27;s education. I think a big problem with the format offered by Coursera is really just this idea of &quot;This course starts this time and ends at this time,&quot; which is, like as you say, trying to mimic traditional class structure for not much apparent reason.<p>What if I did not know there was going to be a Cryptography class on April 10th (I made that up) but I really wanted to go through the course and solve all the problems and get a grade rather than being &quot;penalized&quot; for only finding out about it months later or even after the course completed?

The groups that carry out these attacks do it for attention, and they&#x27;re going to do whatever they can to maximize their press time. That results in worldwide publication of their message, often requiring their opposition to acknowledge and respond, and gives them outlet to advertise to potential new recruits. Airplane attacks and crashes get a lot more coverage than incidents involving similar loss of life due to the emotional factor of being isolated 35,000 feet in the sky, and that makes the cost involved in launching a more intricate attack on aircraft worthwhile.<p>You can try to run away from a bomb at a parking garage after the initial explosion and an ambulance will be there to check things out and rescue people pretty quickly. If you&#x27;re in the plane when it gets attacked, you have no recourse and virtually no chance for survival, which is not usually the case when a ground target is bombed with conventional explosives. Even if you survive the actual ground impact (zero chance if an event happens at cruising altitude, small chance if it happens at a more reasonable altitude during takeoff/landing), there&#x27;s no guarantee you&#x27;ll be anywhere near civilization that can give medical help or attention. This makes the risk of an airborne attack much more frightening, since death is virtually guaranteed.<p>Passengers want a reasonable assurance that there&#x27;s something more than chance protecting the flights they&#x27;re boarding (and for whatever reason, they don&#x27;t usually make the same types of demands from ground entities like parking garages or bus stops). That&#x27;s why the airlines added their own security checkpoints in the 70s as hijackings became prominent. That&#x27;s also the reason the TSA can exist at all. The TSA takes it too far, and we all acknowledge that some threats can&#x27;t be screened out, but just going back to nothing isn&#x27;t a plausible solution, at least not at first.

Another case in point would be TSA airport security measures, which by encouraging more trips to be made by automobile, have arguably <i>increased</i> overall death risks to travelers (as reported by Bruce Schneier and others).  I&#x27;m among those who&#x27;ve either foregone or elected to drive on journeys rather than fly, even aware of the risks (and, frankly, if you&#x27;ve got the time, it&#x27;s often far more interesting and enjoyable).<p>The US Department of Justice reports 685 successful recoveries, though it doesn&#x27;t list the number of activations of the Amber Alert system, nor whether or not the recoveries were materially aided by the system.<p><a href=""http://www.amberalert.gov/statistics.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amberalert.gov/statistics.htm</a><p><i>Edit:</i>  A more complete set of statistics and resolutions from 2002-2011 is given here, including ativation requests received but not resulting in alerts: <a href=""http://www.statisticbrain.com/amber-alert-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statisticbrain.com/amber-alert-statistics/</a><p>According to that, there had been 190 activations (fewer than I&#x27;d thought), 77 were parental abductions (about 35%), acquaintances 55, strangers, 37.  Another 355 alert requests were made but not activated.<p>The Wikipedia article on the Amber Alert system raises a  number of the points I&#x27;ve mentioned above:<p>&quot;A Scripps Howard study of the 233 AMBER Alerts issued in the United States in 2004 found that most issued alerts did not meet the Department of Justice&#x27;s criteria. Fully 50% (117 alerts) were categorized by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children as being &quot;family abductions&quot;, very often a parent involved in a custody dispute. There were 48 alerts for children who had not been abducted at all, but were lost, ran away, involved in family misunderstandings (for example, two instances where the child was with grandparents), or as the result of hoaxes. Another 23 alerts were issued in cases where police did not know the name of the allegedly abducted child, often as the result of misunderstandings by witnesses who reported an abduction.&quot;<p>On stranger abductions:<p>&quot;Seventy of the 233 AMBER Alerts issued in 2004 (30%) were actually children taken by strangers or who were unlawfully travelling with adults other than their legal guardians.&quot;<p>Regarding effectiveness:<p>&quot;Some outside scholars examining the system in depth disagree with the &quot;official&quot; results.[60][61][62] A team led by University of Nevada criminologist Timothy Griffin looked at hundreds of abduction cases between 2003 and 2006 and found that AMBER Alerts actually played little apparent role in the eventual return of abducted children. Furthermore, AMBER Alerts tended to be &#x27;successful&#x27; in relatively mundane abductions, such as when the child was taken by a noncustodial parent or other family member. There was little evidence that AMBER Alerts routinely &#x27;saved lives&#x27;&quot;<p>There are further concerns with AA as &quot;crime prevention theater&quot; (much as the TSA is seen as homeland security theater), of the &quot;crying wolf&quot; effect, over 4 a.m. cell-phone alerts, over use where the Alert criteria aren&#x27;t met, of distraction effects of highway signage especially during rush hour, and more.<p>Contrasting AA with a <i>widespread and imminent natural disaster or civil emergency</i> alert:<p>In the case of an Amber Alert, a very small number of individuals are likely to be in a position to assist at all, let alone <i>actually</i> assist, in a recovery.  Risking &quot;alert fatigue&quot; should be a very real concern.  I am <i>not</i> opposed to forms of widespread message propagation, but these should be done through <i>nonemergency</i> channels (e.g., a news or other scheduled statement or alert), rather than by distracting drivers, waking sleeping people, or interrupting people engaged in other activities, the vast majority of whom have no bearing on the outcome of the incident.<p>In the case of an earthquake, tornado warning, tsunami alert, flash flood, landslide, wildfire, or similar event, <i>people over a widespread area have seconds or minutes to act and take measures which will directly and materially benefit them by saving lives, preventing or reducing injury, and reducing harm or damage to property.</i><p>These are totally different situations.",1408943285

Look at Netflix and House of Cards. People can choose the pace at which they consume. MOOCs are trying to use the class structure and convert it to the online world, not to mention the price structure ($7k for an online course?!? [2]). It is a major pain point, but this seems to be the norm, at least for any of the courses I have looked at.<p>My personal use case is that I want to take a MOOC to learn a specific topic (after I&#x27;ve left school), so that I can use it in my real life, but you want to slow me way down (on some artificial schedule), and then charge me a crap load of money.

But as the field grows it becomes harder for a prospective student to make the right choice for the next step in the career.<p>I understand that you&#x27;re asking for opinions we might have on which programs to take seriously, but I feel that narrowly focusing on that can create a flamewar that won&#x27;t be productive for you as you talk with friends and others about which program to apply to.<p>I&#x27;ll at least start by pointing out some great external resources to help you verify your own opinions, learn about new programs, and help people make an informed decision.<p>- Quora (<a href=""http://quora.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quora.com</a>) is a great resource to get information about which programming bootcamp to choose from. Yes, you can get subjective advice from people inside these bootcamps, but just searching &quot;programming bootcamp&quot; will send you through a wormhole of information.<p>- If you don&#x27;t feel Quora provides you with enough objective data, there are a rising number of bootcamp review sites popping up. From our experience with these sites, I can say that Switch (switchup.org) and CourseReport (coursereport.com) have their stuff together.<p>I will also add that there are other options besides just 3-month programming bootcamps. There are even more intense programming bootcamps like the Turing School of Software & Design (<a href=""http://turing.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://turing.io/</a>) or gSchool (<a href=""http://www.galvanize.it/school/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.galvanize.it/school/</a>), and 30 Weeks (<a href=""https://www.30weeks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.30weeks.com/</a>), a new design school created by Google.<p><i>Taking objective cap off</i><p>We have also created a 9-month program in Chicago called Starter School (<a href=""http://starterschool.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://starterschool.com</a>), which not only teaches web development, but web design, product development, and entrepreneurship.

These programs were created in direct retaliation to that premise. It&#x27;s all about what you learn, what you build, and what type of person you are. The more serious you are about your education, the better chances you have of being successful after you are done with your bootcamp education.",1408943000

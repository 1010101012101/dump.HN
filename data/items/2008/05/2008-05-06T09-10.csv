The security staff had no record of us and, without confirmation from our boss, issued me with a security pass and allowed me to vouch for my ex-colleague. If we weren't genuine, we could have picked any of the weak locks on the third floor and taken any equipment without question.",1210067377

182328,comment,182198,182198,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"You may already know this, but the developers of both Delicious Library and TextMate are going Leopard-only for their version twos.<p>The DL dev's justification is that almost all the people who spend money on software will buy Apple's stuff first, thus being Leopard-only cuts out only a small amount of your market.<p>TextMate's dev justified it in a similar way, saying that 90% of his customers are early-adopters who would be on Leopard as soon as it came out.<p>It is interesting to note that both of these apps have niche markets (people who organise their media collections and programmers/geeks).  Thus, the devs are probably confident in their predictions about not reducing their potential customers too much.",1210066966

Hurrah!) for a while, and I'd say that of the Mac users that call in, most of them are still running Tiger. Leopard wasn't quite compelling enough for many people to justify the price tag.<p>That said, if you really can't advance your current version while remaining backwards-compatible, then why not fork the product and make the Tiger version a little bit cheaper? I've seen that from other developers, and absolutely love them for it.",1210066668

In one case, as rms notes, the question would've been better posed to an accountant. In the other case, you never bothered joining in on the discussion, which is a good way to kill a thread.<p>I definitely don't think there's cause for saying that HN has a glut of 'generic reddit-style stories', or that the discussion here is reducing itself to 'the intellectual tedium of sensationalist media', just because the two questions you posed didn't get any traction at the time. I would expect that the archetypal successful entrepreneur wouldn't give up and cry foul quite so quickly.",1210065954

At least for my site, I'd rather users not have to go to that much trouble to see a nice looking icon. Much easier to just put the right file in the right spot once and saves everyone involved a bit of time.<p>Going by the amount of people who used iPhones at Startup School, this'd be a great little enhancement for a lot of people, myself included.",1210065486

Security wasn&#x27;t taken as seriously in that era.<p>While evidently their bug fix was a little hacky, I guess re-designing how Control Panel applet icons are rendered was considered too big of a change for what was essentially a security patch.<p>Hopefully they kill classic Control Panel completely at some stage in the next few years. Windows 8, 8.1, and now 10 are going down that road but there are a lot of legacy Control Panel applets by third parties which they have to deal with somehow.",1426078772

Which is more economical depends on the value you associate with each channel.<p>If one channel cost $20, or I could get that channel and 9 others for $40, which is better for me? It depends on whether or not those 9 channels are worth $20 to me. If they&#x27;re not, then it&#x27;s not a better deal. Just because I might be willing to pay <i>some</i> money for those 9, doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m willing to pay $20 for them.

9183660,comment,9180795,9183488,0,0,malandrew,,,"The way I see it, any space with written rules (e.g. CoCs) are  essentially spaces with restrictions that dilute cultures so that several cultures with a narrow shared interest can mingle productively. Codes of Conduct are essentially anti-cultural for the sake of achieving collaboration between cultures that share a common interest. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing. It&#x27;s certainly productive in ways and produces something of value, but it is necessarily limiting of cultures (and sub-cultures).<p>The moment you&#x27;re thinking in dichotomous terms like &quot;the organizers&quot; and &quot;the attendees&quot;, you&#x27;re not talking about culture. The moment you cut out the play, you&#x27;re not talking about culture. Every culture has varying degrees of play (that go well beyond the amount of play allowed by any CoC I&#x27;ve seen), and that play is acceptable but only known to members of whatever in-group is in question. Introducing rules that eliminate the play inherent in cultures is okay when you do so for the purpose of letting members of disparate cultures to interact safely with each other. The big concern hackers have and that the author of the article we&#x27;re discussing is getting at, is that the values from which CoCs are fashioned are fine within the confines of the events where they are enforced, but when those values are foisted upon every hacker and nerd sub-culture (including the abrasive ones) and attempts to squelch the diversity of cultures, then it no longer represents intersectionality inclusive of weirdos.<p><pre><code>    The problem about society is that you can&#x27;t cut out social\n    interaction from humans. Any attempt to do so is doomed in\n    my opinion.\n</code></pre>\nExactly. CoCs cut out many types of interaction by humans. That&#x27;s okay and that&#x27;s good. The problem is when the values that led to those CoCs are indiscriminately applied to everyone that participated in an event even when they no longer are participating in an event. One sub-culture might be abrasive. It&#x27;s good that that abrasiveness is not allowed in shared spaces like meetups and conferences, since it allows those without the capacity to handle abrasiveness to participate. It ceases to be good when people try to enforce those values against people even outside venues that proscribe CoCs.<p><pre><code>    What you want is an abrasive culture and I oppose that.\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s fine to oppose when such opposition is limited to venues like meetups and conferences, but universal opposition applied at all times and all places, is inherently not inclusive of abrasive people.<p>highly relevant: <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=137392506516022&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=137392506516022&w=2</a>",1426076429

9183655,comment,9181956,9183333,0,0,pmlamotte,,,"It&#x27;s a programming competition similar to TopCoder or ACM ICPC. You&#x27;re given 4 problems, each with a small (small n) and large (big/huge n) input set, and a time limit to write programs to solve as many as possible. You&#x27;re ranked by the combined score of the ones you&#x27;ve solved, and ranked within that score by how fast you solved each one.<p>For difficult problems you can often write a brute force solution with terrible complexity (think 2^n) for the small input set. For the large though, you&#x27;ll need to really understand the problem and write an efficient solution via memoization, dynamic programming, pruning, or good (sometimes obscure) algorithm choices. For small solutions you get instant checking of your solution on submit (but not what you failed on, only that you did), for large ones you submit and hope for the best.<p>As for why you should care, for me at least it&#x27;s fun to come up with fast solutions to problems regardless of whether they&#x27;re efficient or if my code is well designed. You learn about new types of algorithms and ways of solving problems. For example, dynamic programming was foreign to me until I started doing tons of TopCoder. Google also uses it for recruiting, I&#x27;m still getting contacted by them even though I skipped last year.<p>My favorite moments come from solving problems poorly while knowing there&#x27;s a proper solution out there. Ex: There was a problem in some competition where it was some special way you had to return the y-intercept of a line with a given slope that bisected a particular polygon. There was an actual way to do it properly, but I&#x27;m not so great at math/geometry so I ended up doing a binary search and did enough iterations to get the right amount of floating point precision they wanted.",1426076318

7971053,comment,7963678,7964992,1,0,kyllo,,,"The term &quot;inelasticity&quot; describes consumer demand, rather than the price. As a good becomes increasingly scarce, the price will rise. But when demand is highly &quot;elastic,&quot; the price rise will be mitigated by consumers changing their behavior or seeking a substitute good (in this scenario, by relocating their residence away from NYC). In other words, demand elasticity means that consumers can decide not to pay the higher price because they have alternative options.<p>In the case of NYC housing, the demand is inelastic, meaning that the price increases stick because enough people do not have any acceptable alternative to paying it (likely because employment in their chosen profession requires being physically located in or near Manhattan).",1404226588

The polyfills are nice, but you have to keep a tight eye on performance, and a new browser release could very easily pull out the rug from under you, as the Chrome release last month did, and make your site not work for a large chunk of users. I personally would not do it if I had a whole bunch of browsers I had to test every single thing in.<p>It also takes a little while to get accustomed to the Polymer way of doing things. Our app is a single page webapp and there&#x27;s many things we had to find out for ourselves. Most Polymer documentation is about rendering views, not writing controllers or models that suit web applications.<p>From what I heard, they are working on a tighter integration with Angular.

7970977,comment,7964873,7965804,1,0,gizmo686,,,"I came to FRP in a functionall language (Haskell) so I am not sure how applicable my experience is.<p>Often, you can treat the stream element as an implementation detail. Where possible, you simply define the state of widget A to be a function of the state of widget B. Keeping in mind that this is implemented in terms of streams will tell you what function to use to make this specification. In this line of thinking, I often think of the system as a static network, where each node (representing a widget) is a pure function converting some inputs to output (or has no input and produce a constant output). A widget can also set its appearence based on its input.<p>When the user provides input to a widget (in this model), the corresponding node itself changes to produce a different output (giving you a new, static, graph). For simplicity, I will assume that all user-input widgets correspond to output  only nodes.<p>For example, consider a netwwork, X, with node A corresponding to a textbox. A takes no input, and outputs the constant of the current value of the textbox. Imagine that we know what the value of the textbox will be at all times, and want to animate the entire window. To do this, we can stream in the values of the textbox, and let the network update itself. In this way the textbox is sending a stream of strings into the rest of the network.<p>Moving to a lower level, consider how the textbox itself is implemented. While we can think of it as output only (as I almost always do), it can be implemented as taking a stream of key-events, and outputing a stream of strings. At this level, I take an event driven perspective. While the textbox recieves a &#x27;stream&#x27; of key-events, and outputs a &#x27;stream&#x27; of  strings, what really happens is that whenever there is a key event, the textbox receives it, and emits a string event, in the same way that you might have an onEvent() handler call onStringChange() in a traditioanl OO design.<p>In writing this, and re-reading your question, I think the key difference is that I do not view UI elements as a stream. Instead they are static object that streams pass through. As streams pass through them, they be update the stream or themselves.",1404225861

Banks like Citi, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan and Bank of America have accounts at the Federal Reserve. When clients of those banks transfer US dollars to someone who&#x27;s a client of another bank, the real transfer of dollars takes place between the banks&#x27; accounts at the Federal Reserve.<p>If your bank doesn&#x27;t have an account at the Federal Reserve, then it needs to have an account with a bank that has an account at the Federal Reserve. (Or with a bank that has an account with a bank that has an account at the Federal Reserve, etc.)<p>To be a member of the Federal Reserve, you need to hold a banking license in the US, which means that you are subject to US laws (because, if you ignore them, the US authorities will take your banking license away). You&#x27;ll also have an office there (probably in New York) but that&#x27;s kind of incidental.<p>So, if you&#x27;re a bank with a US banking license, and one of your clients annoys the US authorities, they can basically say &quot;Stop doing business with that client.&quot; (or, in other words, impose sanctions). If you refuse to comply, they can take your licence away.<p>That&#x27;s effectively what happened with BNP Paribas - they were clearing US dollar transactions for clients that were subject to US sanctions. So, BNP has been effectively grounded for a year. Instead of going direct to the Federal Reserve to transfer US dollars to other banks, it will need to become a client of another bank that&#x27;s a member of the Fed.<p>It&#x27;s embarassing, it&#x27;ll cost them money (they&#x27;ll have to pay the other bank) and they may well lose some business (from clients who want to deal with a top-tier US dollar clearing bank).<p>In theory, they could have just turned around and said &quot;Screw you, we&#x27;re not paying any fine!&quot;, in which case the US authorities would have withdrawn their US banking license, seized any assets they could get their hands on (e.g. the dollars they have in their account at the Federal Reserve) and blacklisted the company, so no other US bank would do business with them. That would effectively have prevented them from doing any business in US dollars.<p>To be a proper, credible international bank like BNP, you need to be able to handle US dollars. Hence, BNP is prepared to pay the fine. The alternative would be to effectively downsize massively.",1404225810

Fantasy Sports is a booming industry that is growing every year and has one of the most passionate and engaged users on the web.<p>We have several positions that we are currently trying to hire for as we try to bring home the championship. Sports and fantasy knowledge is a plus, but not required. Just a willingness to get a little crazy and watch sports! Watching sports will be a part of your job, how cool is that? Here is what we are hiring for:<p>1. Data Scientist - We have some of the largest warehouses of both user generated and sports data anywhere. This is a sports nuts&#x27; dream! Apply for this if you love figuring out what users are doing and how to iterate on the product based on numbers.<p>2. Backend engineer - We are creating a new, state of the art backend infrastructure. Fantasy Sports is one of the most challenging backends on the web, due to the spiky nature of traffic. During an NFL Sunday, our peak RPS can exceed twitter! Apply for this if you love massive scaling and performance optimization.<p>3. Mobile engineer - Looking for both iOS and Android expertise. I was acquired by Yahoo last year (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a-one-man-fantasy-sports-app-maker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...</a>), and my goal is to make Yahoo Fantasy Sports the runaway leader in mobile sports apps. We have a great team of designers and developers, and Yahoo mobile is actually now the largest mobile development organization in the world! We are taking mobile seriously, and you can help us get there.<p>4. SDET - For fantasy sports, we can NOT make mistakes. No fumbles, no turnovers, nothing. Our crack team of SDETs writes automated test scripts and build testing and release infrastructure to make sure that the devs can move fast and (not) break things!<p>Yahoo may not be the most glamorous company in the Valley, and we definitely don&#x27;t have it all figured out. Most startups let you make a big impact in a small pond, and a big company lets you make a small impact in a big pond. Yahoo is the rare opportunity to make a big impact in a big pond. There is a lot of low hanging fruit that we need to solve, and if you want to be part of one of the most epic turnaround stories in the Valley, then hit me up!<p>If you wanna come kick ass and chew bubble gum, hit me up at bignoggins@yahoo-inc.com!",1404225765

I like that RubyMotion is supporting Android soon and that will help a ton, but I think for most devs, just learning Swift and getting good with the native tools will be better in the long run than deep diving on RubyMotion.<p>That being said, I hope RubyMotion continues to do well.

From bank surveillance, to all of the other signal evidence one would leave entering and exiting the crime scene, not to mention that all of the bills are marked and would have to be spent and laundered with great care.<p>For this reason, its easier to rob in other ways. ATMs may be easy to hack, but hard to get away with. Otherwise two things would be happening:<p>1) More ATMs would get hacked<p>2) Banks would actually invest in the security of the physical machine.<p>My guess is there are other means to catch the crooks.

We’re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.<p>WHO WE ARE.  Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation’s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href=""http://mappiness.org.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href=""http://www.getsomeheadspace.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).<p>WHAT WE USE.  We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and/or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We’ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we’re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don’t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.<p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE.  We’re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and/or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important — and usually the hardest — thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github/BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.<p>WHERE WE’RE AT.  Geographically we’re currently at Nuffield Health&#x27;s offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices) but a move to Brighton is likely in the works over the next year. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you’d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.<p>Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk",1404223416

If you&#x27;re a smart, motivated developer who likes our company culture, let&#x27;s talk.<p>Over the past 16 years we&#x27;ve cultivated a great group of people to work with. Our developers are smart, thoughtful, respectful to each other, opinionated, dedicated, and fun. We don&#x27;t hire often, and when we do, we value these qualities as much as technical abilities.<p>Founded by a former computer science professor, in many ways we keep the same feel as a small computer science lab (without the long hours):<p><pre><code>    Challenging and varied projects\n    Informal, comfortable environment\n    Intelligent, engaged people\n    Lively, respectful technology discussions\n    Frequent mentoring\n    Easy camaraderie\n    General culture of helpfulness and friendliness \n</code></pre>\nTeams at TechEmpower are typically between 2 and 6 people. Because of the small size of our teams, we need developers able to work on all aspects of an application (&quot;full stack&quot; developers). We rely on individual developers to do much of the software design, with guidance and discussion, and actively work to improve each other&#x27;s technical capabilities.<p>On average, a typical developer will get exposure to 3 or 4 different projects over the course of a year. Since each project has a different technology stack, developers gain varied experience over time and never stop learning.<p>We pride ourselves on doing the best work we can for our clients. This means working with them to really understand what they need built, carefully planning how to do it, and delivering what we promise while maintaining a sensible work/life balance. We build quality applications and have fun doing it.<p>Also, we enjoy programming on high-performance workstations with 4K displays. A lot of code fits in 3840x2160 pixels!<p>The technologies we use vary over time with our mix of projects. Here is a snapshot of the technologies we use at the moment:<p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP\n    Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven\n    Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.\n    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap\n    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments\n    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB) \n</code></pre>\nWe don&#x27;t expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but developers at TechEmpower can expect to expand their skillsets with most of these over time.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you&#x27;d like to work, please apply here: \n<a href=""http://jobs.techempower.com/hn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobs.techempower.com/hn</a>",1404223294

We&#x27;ve got strong domain expertise in the area and believe that there&#x27;s a massive opportunity in the space.<p>You&#x27;ll be working on core projects on day 1 and once you&#x27;re familiar with the source, expect to be leading key projects. You&#x27;ll be challenged constantly as we keep pushing the boundaries of what a &#x27;simple&#x27; app can do (algorithms, image analysis etc..).<p>We&#x27;re also quite open about our numbers and our plans, so please drop us a line (hadi@stylectapp.com) and lets chat. Coffee is on us :).<p>P.S: We&#x27;re willing to be flexible for STRONG candidates because our biggest priority is to build an amazing team.",1404223275

We&#x27;re looking for an excellent front-end developer. You love Javascript, but are comfortable picking up other languages, and obsess over building the best possible user experience. Customer feedback is our guiding light so working closely with users in shaping Kivo should excite you.<p>Our back end is Scala / Play and we&#x27;re in the process of moving to Angular, so bonus points for experience with that.<p>Equity grants will be well above market for first hires and salary will be competitive. We want new partners, not just employees, so we are looking for people who are as driven to succeed as we are.<p>We&#x27;re hiring for people who want to help lead the team as we continue to grow, so you should be excited to shape the development culture of a fast growing start-up.<p>We also know there&#x27;s more to life than work. You get gym membership for gyms across London and an extremely sociable team to work with. We love poker, eating out, tennis, and nights at the pub.<p>If this sounds exciting, ping us (leo@kivo.com) and we&#x27;d love to buy you lunch and have a chat.",1404223213

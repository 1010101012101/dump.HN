Say what you will about that Atomwise article, they&#x27;re playing in a well-known space. There are existing companies (generally small) selling exactly that sort of service to drug companies. It&#x27;s an open question whether or not their particular approach is sufficiently better to give them a sustainable advantage in what is an extremely competitive, low-budget space (relative to med-tech), but the business model is plausible.<p>Most of the biotech companies coming out of YC are what I&#x27;d characterize as total fliers -- unlike the company highlighted by the Forbes article, these startups aren&#x27;t being founded by a collection of gray-haired biotech executives with a collective 200 years of research experience in a single disease. And that&#x27;s fine. One of the biggest problems in biotech right now is that everything is too stodgy and conservative. When I got out of grad school, there was no way of starting a biotech company without putting in 20+ years in academia or at drug company. You wouldn&#x27;t get funding.<p>If funding a few grad students for oddball biotech startups leads to a single success, it has the possibility of really opening up the field. And in the worst case, very little money will be lost. I think it&#x27;s a good thing.

The 90% number comes from an estimated $100 billion price tag for another moon shot - in short, the study estimates we could land humans on the moon for just $10 billion. It&#x27;s unclear if that&#x27;s $10 billion in addition to NASA&#x27;s current budget.<p>> <i>Enabled by public-private partnerships, NASA’s current human spaceflight budget is sufficient to return humans to the surface of the Moon and develop a permanent lunar base.</i><p>Does this mean repurposing NASA&#x27;s entire budget? Doesn&#x27;t the current budget include maintenance/monitoring for many long-term projects including Hubble, NuSTAR, New Horizons, STEREO, etc? So we&#x27;d have to choose to abandon all current research to fit another moon trip into the budget?<p>> <i>Mining fuel from lunar poles and transporting it to lunar orbit for use by other spacecraft reduces the cost of sending humans to Mars and other locations beyond low Earth orbit. These commercial fuel depots in lunar orbit have the potential to cut the cost of sending humans to Mars by more than $10 billion per year.</i><p>This second bullet point is a somewhat longer reach. Once we have fuel depots constructed in lunar orbit, we can more cheaply mine spaceship fuel from the moon&#x27;s poles, and refuel ships in orbit instead of landing them on a gravity well.<p>First, this assumes the lunar poles will have the specific material we&#x27;re using for fuel, something which is unknown to myself. Secondly, this assumes we have already constructed the orbiting fuel depots. This will definitely be the way to go once we have these constructed, but for now they don&#x27;t reduce the price for lunar or Mars trips.",1437510759

No one is going to pay $30-75 million dollars to buy up 120-300 homes (average going price is $250,000 offered per every $190,000 home to get the owners out), then pay millions to bulldoze the homes, then pay millions to build the office park. No. They will go out in the middle of no-where and offer $5-10 million to a farmer and build on his land instead. It&#x27;s cheaper but this creates quite a drive.<p>I also used to work as a courier and I -> HATED <- industrial/office park runs.

Office parks aren&#x27;t as bad and usually closer to civilization.<p>- The cost, how does $7,000 a month sound for an office space smaller than a 2 bedroom house?<p>- The US recession shut down a lot of businesses in premium locations and this opens up opportunities for new tenants to replace them and start their business closer to their homes, instead of paying exuberant prices to rent space in an office park.<p>- They are soulless.

Perhaps they reverse the depth test, to store, at each pixel in the shadow buffer, the distance to the object <i>furthest</i> from the light source.  This would then be distance to the occluder closest to the ground plane.<p>But I don&#x27;t see evidence of blockiness that such a pixelized distance map would produce.

I don&#x27;t see how they could test each such ray against the whole scene, and do that using the GPU.<p>While I&#x27;m on the topic, the soft shadows they compute are <i>not</i> exact, since they assume the light source is a circle, and their analytic formula for the penumbra angle is an approximation.  Shadows would look different for linear lights like fluorescent tubes.<p>But hey, if you&#x27;re in the middle of a game, dodging enemies, you won&#x27;t stop to criticize the slightly incorrect shadows.

See: <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnetnative"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnetnative</a>. I don&#x27;t think it yet supports F#, but that&#x27;s likely on the roadmap.<p>Reflection is supported on .NET Native Native. See: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/05/20/net-native-deep-dive-dynamic-features-in-static-code.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/05/20/net-native...</a>. Reflection.Emit is not.<p>There are effectively three codegen strategies: JIT, pre-jit and static compilation/AOT. They all have their own characteristics and reasons why they are a good choice. I can see that you have depth here, but I&#x27;m going to provide an answer with more context, for a broader audience.<p>- JIT has the most flexibility since the code is generated (you guessed it) just in time. This means that the code generated can be specialized in terms of hardware or use a layered approach to codegen (prefer throughput and then CQ for hotter methods). It is also the best for versioning, since the code is always generated in terms of the actual dependencies, as opposed to the ones you happened to compile with.<p>- Pre-JIT can be very high performance since you don&#x27;t have to pay for JIT and other related costs up-front, as is the case with NGEN. Depending on the code generated, it may be subject to the fragile base class problem: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class</a>, as is the case with NGEN. MDIL is also subject to it, but we made the cost to regenerate images very low. There can be a problem of when to generate the images and where to store them. These two issues have been a constant design challenge for us (mostly the former). At least on the surface, pre-jit is much cheaper than AOT, particularly since you can rely on a JIT for the code that you can generate deterministically (at least into a single bit of code) ahead of time (think generics). ReadyToRun (<a href=""https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/227"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/227</a>) is a project we&#x27;re working that makes NGEN/CrossGen images more resilient to the fragile base class problem.<p>-  AOT can be very high performance, for the same reasons. We&#x27;ve found that it is even higher performance since you can skip a number of architecural requirements for a dynamic runtime environment. If you couple this with app-local framework and runtime distribution, as is the case with .NET Native, then you also skip the fragile base class problem. Building a high-performance industrial quality AOT system with a fabulous developer experience is a fantastic computer science challenge. We&#x27;ve certainly found it to be that. We&#x27;re several years into AOT investments and we&#x27;re finding that it is paying off.",1437510275

The data we deal with is massively relational, with some very large tables and result outputs, so there&#x27;s no way around using a tidy RDBMS for us, and consistency is a big thing.<p>PHP, with a few tiny, high speed libraries for DB connection management and routing. As far as possible everything uses PHP functions that map directly on to underlying language equiv, and we make a lot of use of streaming and generators, which makes memory overhead nicely manageable. When HHVM becomes a thing for us, we&#x27;ll then start pulling some of this over to Hack.<p>That&#x27;s all set up as a bunch of RESTful APIs, which are reasonably HATEOAS in their outputs.

We&#x27;re slowly converting into React, so initially we used HistoryJS to manage URL history, along with React to render stuff. Qwest for XHR handling, and a few little libraries and helper functions (of note: moment.js and numeral.js).<p>Everything then gets executed on the client. Current roadmap is to build something akin to React router for managing loading of assets and better history management, and to pull the entire front end into a single application. At the moment, it&#x27;s better thought of as a bunch of distinct SPAs, operating over a common middleware.<p>Architecturally, the back end services are written MVA, with data going through our own DAL, with RBAC sitting in front of everything. Caching is handled in the DAL, so everything acts as a black box - models don&#x27;t know where the data came from, adapters don&#x27;t know where the model got it&#x27;s data etc...<p>The front end is written loosely around a Flux style architecture. Data is held in a single area, as are all methods that interface with state. Those parts sit at the top, and pass data as props down to UI components, written to be dumb as to where there data comes from.<p>IO is mostly via single HTTP requests, but with the option to hook onto ZMQ for real time interaction.<p>Hope that helps!

So I attempted to defend my company&#x27;s policies (as I explained in the post.)<p>The overall point is that I can&#x27;t help contribute to GPL code because the GPL license prevents me from using it in the first place.  (My company&#x27;s policies are a red herring, they&#x27;re merely there to make sure I use software properly.)  I am theorizing that perhaps a developer may want my contributions, which is why they may want to consider that before they choose the GPL.<p>Edit:  Ah, I think I understand now... when you said my company has bad policies you meant <i>not open sourcing our SaaS</i> is the bad policy, not <i>don&#x27;t use GPL</i> as a policy.

9925337,comment,9920641,9922769,0,0,Maultasche,,,"I was in Belgrade in 1999 about five days before the US started bombing the place. The people there were very friendly to me, even when they knew I was an American. The border guards sure scrutinized me and my passport (I had a transit visa), but they didn&#x27;t give me any trouble other than that.<p>One of my more memorable experiences was visiting Tito&#x27;s mausoleum. It was very quiet and I was the only person there. I got the impression that nobody was interested in visiting Tito anymore. The elderly security guard there was very happy to seem me and he talked to me in rudimentary German, the only language we had in common. As a gift he gave me some book discussing some Yugoslavian communist party conference back in the 60s with an English translation. Nice guy.<p>I was traveling from Sarajevo (a sad city at the time) on a bus through the Serbian part of Bosnia, and I was a little nervous about that. There were no problems though. Our bus did break down in a snowstorm and we were stuck there next to the road for about six hours, so I had plenty of time to talk to the other passengers (all Serbian as far as I could tell). They were either friendly or didn&#x27;t pay attention to me, probably because most didn&#x27;t speak any language I knew.<p>A couple in front of me on that bus were telling me that they heard that the Americans were about to bomb Belgrade at any moment. There was no animosity toward me personally, though: they were friendly people. I thought that was nonsense because the news had been talking about that for months and nothing seemed to be coming out of it. It turned out that in the few weeks I&#x27;d been traveling that things had gotten much more serious. I might have reconsidered traveling through Serbia if I knew things had gotten that serious. I saw a newspaper in Greek a few days after I left the country showing Belgrade and pictures of stealth bombers. I knew then that the people I was talking to had been right.<p>I haven&#x27;t been to that region since that time, but I&#x27;d love to go again. I have lots of memories of friendly people.",1437509089

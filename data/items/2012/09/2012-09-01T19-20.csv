4464927,comment,4464625,4464898,1,0,Jd,,,"Thanks. I personally believe in right and wrong, but also in degrees of right and wrong. Doing the right thing in a situation where everyone else is doing the wrong thing is more difficult. Doing the right thing when everyone is doing the right thing is easy. Thus, you don't really know your values or the depth of your values until you are placed in a situation where it is difficult to carry them out.<p>Here, for ""culpability"" I mean simply that I believe that the power to actualize the values of each individual differs, and that those who are able to actualize their values even in very difficult situations is worth more and to be praised more than those who are unable to and go with the flow.<p>This is to say that simply saying you have certain values means nothing. You have to act on those values and, because acting on those values can be difficult, I have sympathy for those who fail to -- even as I praise those who do.",1346529594

b) Political stability
c) Market Regulation (e.g. fair competition, orderly markets, currency,etc)
d) and risk reduction<p>Capitalists are free to asks for any other thing that decreases risk, it doesn't mean the government has to respond in all cases. I disagree with George, there is not direct path between incentives and socialism.",1346529590

4464924,comment,4464625,4464625,5,0,tmsh,,,"The thing about intellectual honesty is that when you don't feel like you know much relative to your peers and context (e.g., you're a freshman at Harvard), you don't think you have much to lose. You don't realize what you have to lose until it becomes clear about all the hidden potential that you've taken for granted and that you're risking -- how important intellectual honesty is to any type of sustainable effort.<p>So there is a chicken and egg problem with intellectual honesty. You don't appreciate it until you've acquired experience. And you don't acquire sustainable experience until you start to appreciate it.<p>The flip side though is that most young people just need to be told and slightly inspired about how important it is. Then they need to develop that over several years. In college can work. Learning to be confident with your own intellectual pursuits based on honesty though -- that's what college is supposed to teach. But yeah, a lot of time in all the competitiveness, it gets lost.",1346529516

Or tweets?  Or notifications over any of the myriad instant messaging platforms that already have iOS clients?  Not only does it bypass apple's silly app store restrictions, it offers a much better experience for a much wider variety of users.<p>The only reason I see that makes the app store the best place for this is that app store users like to throw money at silly things they don't need, and the primary reason this is true is because apple has fostered an environment that makes it true.  If apple feels that the presence of a drone strike app will make people less inclined to spend money in their store, that is exactly the sort of decision that this app developer is trying to capitalize on.  It just went the wronG way for him this time.",1346529515

4464914,comment,4464095,4464877,5,0,TazeTSchnitzel,,,"PHP is still very Java-like in some ways though. Well... PHP likes to pretend it's a dynamic language (Closures, for instance), but at its core it's a very strange dynamic/static hybrid, utilising a single-pass compiler and with type checking done with syntax definitions(!)<p>Which is why this doesn't work: (actual intended production code)<p><pre><code>  self::$views[$path]();

Why? Because the syntax doesn't accomodate calling a closure that is an item in an array, which is a static member of a class.<p>But this works:<p><pre><code>  $x = self::$views[$path];

What does Twitter gain by putting a hard limit on API usage?</i><p>There <i>is</i> a reason for a hard cap: the limit's goal is to ensure twitter-owned clients dominate the market for basic twitter use.<p>You may have a point by saying that twitter can simply make the tax per additional tweet equal to the approximate revenue they plan to lose as a result. But that figure may be hard to calculate, especially its long-term value. So even if a company is willing to pay 5x to twitter per additional tweet over the hard limit, twitter doesn't know the long-term impact of it",1346529407

The primary function of this app is obviously to make a bold statement about the atrocities of war.<p>Apple doesn't want to publish an app that is designed to provoke the audience. Apple can't let just anyone post apps to the App Store, because the whole idea behind that store is to provide products that meet minimum quality requirements, so users don't have to search through all the crap to find the good stuff.<p>Letting everyone publish would drown out many good apps in favor of shit. Letting everyone publish often gives you problems with system stability from poorly witten code, something I've encountered on several Android phones.<p>The iDevices are NOT computers. They're digital appliances. How often do you hear people complain that they can't modify the source code of their microwave or their car. Hardly ever, because expectations are different.<p>Apple's policies make perfect sense if you view it their products same way you view a TV. They're not designed for nerds!",1346529383
4464909,comment,4463616,4463967,3,0,stewartbutler,,,"I can think of two ways to do it.<p>First, you could put the piezo film (commonly used in speakers for cellphones, more efficient for smaller transducers but requires a special amplifier) directly below (but in contact with) the display and use the display as the 'diaphragm'. Makes the entire display a speaker, but would require some interesting sound cancelling tricks to avoid feedback with the microphone.<p>Second, you could use a piezo below the display with an airgap and use something akin to the laser used in the power LEDs on the Macbooks to poke enough airholes to direct the sound toward the ear.<p>A third method, which I'm not sure would work, is to suspend the piezo material between two ITO layers (like that used in the capacitive touchscreen) and put it <i>above</i> the display. Depends on if someone has found a transparent piezoelectric material yet; I haven't been keeping up with the materials science side of things.",1346529369

Making fashionable-looking hardware and putting together some obvious and old ideas (eg., pinch to zoom) is not the same as 'investing in innovation'""</i><p>I read comments like this, and all my brain sees is: ""WAAAH!""<p>Companies don't give up their rights to legal protection once they get to a size that the internet thinks is ""too big"".  And that's a great thing -- it's how small companies become large companies without being killed by nasty parasites who do nothing but copy good products to eat away at profit margins.<p>As for the argument that Apple didn't do anything innovative:   take a walk, please.  Unless you're too young to remember the world of cellphones in 2007, you can't make a reasonable claim that there was no innovation in what they did with the iPhone.  Lots of people want to <i>post hoc</i> rationalize the fact that the market has been flooded with iPhone-esque devices by calling it ""innovation"" (as if lower prices were somehow innovative).  But I was there, and I <i>remember</i> the phone I had before I had an iPhone:  It flipped open.  It had a keyboard.  It barely fit in my pocket, and had a tiny, low-resolution screen.  <i>I had to buy an expensive, custom headphone to listen to music.</i><p>Rationalize whatever you like, but Apple revolutionized the cellphone market, and they deserve the spoils of their risk-taking.  If this is how they do that within the confines of the current legal system, so be it.  They deserve to win.",1346529364

Specifically if you play your cards right and get involved with the right group of people, you get your ""ticket punched"" which can and does lead to other future opportunities. As much as I would like to side with your belief (and myself use ""gamble"" many times to describe what people are doing) for a young person who can afford to take a chance (or an older person who doesn't have financial or family concerns) it might be a gamble worth taking.<p>Think of it as a person who marries a celebrity fully knowing that the relationship might not work out. They get to attend parties, they meet ""important"" people, they move in the right circles they get their picture in the press. The relationship breaks up. Are they better off than the same person who is living in the middle of nowhere and has the same experience? I'd say they are exposed to things that give them much more opportunity to land on their feet.<p>Or as another example someone who pursues a dream to win a gold medal at the Olympics and doesn't even get a bronze.

This was essentially asynchronous lab work: we could always talk though problems together, but we were never able to cut and paste code (the detection system looked for things like whitespace to detect cut-and-paste vs hand-typed).<p>When there were two matching submissions, both students would be pulled up and then the administration had to figure out who copied who. What I heard on the grapevine was that usually it was really obvious: students that had been struggling were the ones most likely to cheat, and even when they matched in ability, the guilty party would crack pretty quickly and own up.<p>Personally, I think there are better ways of doing computer science assignments anyway: I tend to TA classes where students work on self-defined projects rather than doing the same rote exercise, so cut-and-paste is no help anyway.",1346528347

I don't agree at all. Aside from the formal rules, smart people pick up on which rules can be broken safely. In fact, knowing which rules in life you should break and which rules you should follow is probably a critical factor for success in life.<p>Jaywalking is illegal in most (all?) US cities, but in many it's completely acceptable behavior. Jaywalking in Seattle (edit: was Manhattan), on the other hand is not done and you better not do it within eyesight of a police officer. Jaywalking in the Netherlands is completely fine (even right in front of the police), but in Germany it's not. The laws are the same, but the culture is different.<p>There are thousands of examples of socially acceptable behavior that doesn't correspond with the law. Drinking in public. Sometimes fine, sometimes not. Forging a signature. Occasionally fine, usually not.<p>Startups break laws all the time too. You have to get a product out first, and only when you start making money you get lawyers involved to make sure everything is going by the books. But if you aren't making real money yet the government really doesn't care whether you follow every law to the letter. And as a founder you have to decide which laws can be broken safely and which laws must be obeyed. Get it wrong and you may lose your company: either through legal trouble or because it doesn't get off the ground. The founders talk freely about the laws they broke. They brag about it! It's considered clever. Relentlessly resourceful. It's a fine line.<p>So if the culture in Harvard was such that cooperating for take-home exams was sometimes acceptable and sometimes not, then I consider that a legitimate excuse. It's easy to test too. Just look at the exams of that course of the previous years and check if people worked together on those too. Compare with other courses. If the results show that students consistently break the ""individual work only"" clause for some courses and not for other courses then the students probably didn't think they were doing anything wrong.

If you give people problems whereby they feel that they cannot do well without cheating (i.e. when everyone else is cheating), then cheating becomes institutionalized. Thus, to be cheating in a class where 99% of the students are cheating is to be somewhat less culpable than to be among the students cheating when only 1% of the students are cheating.<p>That is to say, to have a situation when cheating becomes the norm implies a much larger institutional and cultural collapse in which the larger framework (and not simply the cheating individuals) demands investigation.<p>What are the larger trends here?<p>Well, the first might simply be the idea that greed is okay.  In this case, we can witness the following transformation in American values fairly clearly.<p>Phase 1 (religious): Greed is bad, we do things for the sake of a heavenly kingdom only. We are only temporary stewards of the wealth we have.<p>Phase 2 (agnostic): Greed may be a necessary part of evolution and competition for limited resources, but we need to limit it and make it a long term sort of greed.<p>Phase 3 (hedonist): My identity is defined by how much money I have, and I don't care how I get it.<p>In other words, there is long-term value erosion. This is not to say that one's values necessarily have to be religious-Christian in derivation, but in the American context this was overwhelmingly the case and this erosion has basically given way to live in the moment materialism.<p>The practical consequences is that many people involved in business, and this is most clear in the financial sector which has no ostensible tie to any product whatsoever and attracts people who care only about money, not only seek money, but seek to destroy any barriers that keep them from getting as much money as possible. In the US this has meant saturation of elite universities (pulling an increasing proportion of the best and brightest into the financial sector), buying out of the major political parties, shutting out the minor political parties, and removing regulatory functions (i.e. the SEC). Additionally, there is the desire to weaken the electorate by importing cheap labor from other countries that will be liable to manipulation via mass media, decreasing the likelihood that any independent party will achieve critical mass.<p>Because this is a long-term institutional problem there is no obvious solution, except to continue with the values that have not entirely been eroded (i.e. honesty) and to encourage others who do their function (i.e. continue working in the public sector and enforcing existing regulation). Creating new services and teams of people that are doing a good job simply for the sake of doing a good job is never a bad idea either -- although it is always easy to get sucked into the mentality of ""greed is good.""",1346527797

A plan to follow (you can easily find great ones online these days) telling you what to do in high school (with respect to classes, extracurricular activities, volunteering, leadership, standardized tests, recommendation letters, etc.)<p>2. Money (i.e., live in an relatively affluent area with a good public school or attend a good private school)<p>3. Determination (lots of it)<p>Your personality doesn't matter <i>at all</i> for anything other than the interview, which you can also pass with flying colors as long as you have basic acting skills (which can be easily learned as well). Basically just smile a lot and don't act like a psychopath at the interview, and you're good to go.<p>As for getting into a <i>specific</i> college, that's a crapshoot. The admissions process is a black box, and there's no way to guarantee admission to a certain university unless your parents are big donors.

Invodo helps businesses sell more through the power of video. As a full-service video solution, Invodo creates high-quality video at scale, delivers it through retail-focused technology, and publishes to Facebook, YouTube and retail channel partners to expand the impact. The Invodo video solution increases conversion rates, reduces returns and drives site traffic for clients including Internet 500 retailers and major manufacturers.<p>Invodo is an early-stage company so as a Senior Software Engineer you will play an incredibly important role in the success of both our clients and Invodo.<p>Software Engineers are expected to take ownership of substantial software modules, assist with technical product design, and contribute to the software engineering process at Invodo. The development will be concentrated on our core content management system and analytics platform (my.invodo.com). This customer-facing application software is written in Java/GWT using Hibernate and MySQL backend services.<p>Nearly all of our infrastructure services are written using Scala while the web application is currently written in Groovy (historical artifact at this point).  It's hard to cover everything we do technology-wise in a short post, but we have our own player, make heavy use of CDNs for content distribution, our own analytics system and platform as well as an end-to-end workflow management tool used internally and externally for the video production, management and hosting process (the latter is where we're looking to hire).<p>The entire engineering team is less than 20 people, including operations, professional services and management.  There are currently 9 developers (if I'm counting correctly) and all of the work the engineering department does is recognized throughout the company.<p>Feel free to send your resume/github/project urls to mbrace@invodo.com or ismarc31@gmail.com.",1346526895

In case of doubt, for something like domain name seizures, there is a two word solution -- 'due process'.  More generally there is a one word solution -- 'vote'.<p>Yes, a good candidate for the most important problem facing the US and civilization is the citizens having too little information to monitor their government as well as is crucial.  The good news is that we are now at the beginnings of by far the best solution so far in history -- the free and open Internet.<p>We're beginning to understand:  For the most important players and purposes, PIPA and SOPA were actually not about 'protecting content'.  Instead PIPA and SOPA were to be some new laws that could be selectively enforced to build a political machine and get power.  So, if make your campaign contributions ""on time"", then you are free to do business.  Else, the FBI may knock down your door, trash your offices, and take your computers.<p>PIPA and SOPA are just small potatoes:  So, make your campaign contributions on time, and continue to operate your coal fired electric generating plant.  Else the EPA may shut you down.  In recent years coal has been the source of about 49% of US electric power.  So, the EPA is a means of a shakedown of essentially all of the US energy industry.<p>Look, to the important players and purposes, reducing CO2 emissions to stop 'global warming' is just an excuse to execute a shakedown and build a political machine and get power.  Those players care about 'climate change', 'global warming', 'rising sea levels', 'more frequent hurricanes', etc. less than a spit to windward.<p>We've already seen the shakedown of the Internet.  The ""National Broadband Plan"" would give more such power over the Internet for more shakedowns and power.<p>Having the DHS run 'Internet security' would be another case -- more opportunities for shakedowns, building a political machine, and getting power.<p>Then there's the takeover and shakedown opportunities of 17% of the US economy, i.e., all of US health care.  Believe me, to the important players and purposes, health care is just an excuse.<p>Then with control over all of US health care, essentially dictatorial control directly by appointed bureaucrats in the Executive Branch, unionize the 21 million health care workers and have them as a source of 'Brown Shirts'.  Did I mention, it's not about health care.  Instead it's about building a political machine and getting power.<p>Then there's the same for transportation, i.e., play nice and get help with your hybrid electric car project to try to satisfy the 50 MPG standard; not play nice and go broke.<p>Also if go broke but play nice, then get a bailout like GM did and, presto, have the US Treasury holding some of your preferred stock with someone appointed by the Executive Branch on your Board.  Play nice and some 'stimulus' money can go to local governments to buy your cars, and now you have money enough to pay your unions what they want.  Not play nice and you're out'a business.<p>Besides, another proposal is much more in passenger trains instead of private cars and, thus, more Federal Government control and more opportunities for shakedowns, political machine building, and power.<p>Another proposal is to do for all of US manufacturing what was done for GM -- under the control of the Executive Branch.<p>Look, the real objectives are not to do good things about energy, health care, finance, manufacturing, communications, transportation, the environment, or the economy, all of which are being used just as excuses.  Instead, there are other objectives.  And the step now is toward just one word, power, based on essentially a political machine based on new laws, regulations and, then, selective enforcement, shakedowns, payoffs, and kickbacks.<p>Then for the real objectives, that subject needs a revolution, and a standard prerequisite is a 'rotten door' so that the revolution is kicking in the rotten door.  So, on the way to revolution, work to make the door rotten.  So, the goal for now is not to make things better but to make them worse.<p>Then with the power of a political machine and a rotten door, kick in the rotten door and have the revolution.<p>What will be the goals of the revolution?  We have to guess, but we have a lot of hints.<p>Look, guys, the risk is not just to your domain name.<p>But there is a solution:  Become informed and, then, just one word.  May I have the envelope, please (drum roll):  Yes, here it is, ""vote"".",1346526481

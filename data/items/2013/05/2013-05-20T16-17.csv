How do you require someone to respect your opinion?<p>You could try something like demanding X number of reporting employees or Y execs who agree to attend your meetings, I guess. But the other party is going to reflexively resist getting down to this level of detail in the contract, even if they're completely sincere about the promises they've made to you, just because no business owner likes to have their hands tied operationally in such a way. Not to mention that even those types of clauses can be worked around -- you get a guarantee that the COO will attend a weekly meeting, and then he makes a big show each time of answering email on his smartphone rather than paying attention to what you're saying. Might seem unfair to you as the acquired party, but everyone else in the company will be rooting for him against the ""outsider.""",1369069001

Whether it's an IPO or an options contract, there's a great deal of complexity behind many financial instruments, and just because your brokerage gives you the opportunity to pull the lever it doesn't mean you're qualified to do so.<p>On the other hand, it's hard to work up sympathy for the woman in the story. Yes, she wasn't privy to behind-the-scenes details. But it sounds like she put less research into her $200K ""investment"" decision than she did with the last car she bought. The Atlantic may have left out the details of her late-night scouring of web pages for information, but as a proxy for retail investors in general it's probably accurate.<p>Here's the only thing a retail investor needs to know about IPOs: FB isn't the exception, it's the rule. Buy an IPO on opening day and the vast majority of the time you're going to lose money. Why? (And I wish I could bold and underline this.) Because the IPO isn't to make <i>you</i> money. Stay the hell away from them unless you know what you're doing.

I'm talking about the timestamp delta between ""I'm hungry (or bored, or its a habit, or whatever)"" and ""I'm eating"".<p>Its not that it takes 3 hours of work to make bread, its that it takes 3 hours from ""I'm hungry and I'm going to do something about it"" to the reward of gulping down fresh bread.  So its harder to get fat off homemade bread, than, say, a can of corn syrup soda.  20 minutes for bolognese sauce (only outta a can I'm thinking, unless you're an iron chef or something) vs 3 minutes for a chocolate bar and a can of coke from the vending machine.<p>I'm not arguing its right.

In contrast, the vast majority of GUI apps on Windows, OS X and Linux inactivate the selection leaving the insertion point at the right (left) edge of where the selection was (and you can get the behavior that Emacs uses by modifying the right-arrow key press with the shift key). Aquamacs chose the Emacs way of behaving here.<p>In summary, <i>most</i> of the choices Aquamacs made for when to do things the Emacs way and when to do them the standard GUI way differ from the choice I would have made.<p>P.S. In the situation examined above, the behavior of Acme (tested on plan9port on OS X) also differs from standard GUI behavior, but in a way different from how Emacs differs: Acme inactivates the selection, but then moves the insertion point one character to the right of the right edge of where the insertion point was, which makes some sort of internal logical sense (if the selection is considered to be a sort of insertion point that has temporarily stretched to be n characters wide) but is a poor design decision for Acme users that have to switch back and forth between Acme and other GUI apps.",1369068482

I used Angular.js and Asp.Net Web API for this project.<p>Here is a bit about it from our press release:<p>Spectre makes the creation of documents such are business requirements (BRD) and technical specifications ""ridiculously"" easy.  The goals of these documents are to assist the project management and implementation process.  This is critical for companies that have organizational objectives while remaining solution independent.  A BRD details the business solutions for a project that helps business people communicate their technical needs to the ones developing them and vice versa.<p>Not only does Spectre make this process easy, but also by using guided questions and project templates, it makes your documents collaborative, so that the right experts are able to contribute. In addition it will create living breathing documents that can evolve with your project, so that your requirements are not a tomb of good intentions.

The biggest thing keeping me from doing so is the cost of living. In South Carolina I rent a 1200 ft^2 (~110 m^2) 3 bedroom house on a third of an acre for less than $1,000 per month. I live about 10 minutes from the beach (Atlantic), and 15 minutes from work. My wife's a marine biologist and a yoga instructor. She'd be able to teach classes there, but it will take a while (if it's even possible) for her to get well-enough acquainted with the orgs in the area to continue her career as a biologist. That means to keep the same disposable income I'd need to cover both our salaries, plus the increased cost of living, and all the risk of our livelihood would be on me. The last time I ran the numbers I figured out that in order for us to have the same disposable income I'd need to make over $200k/yr or trade salary requirement for long commute times.",1369068032

I've always liked that particular feature. Honestly, most of the time, it seems like OCaml is the only language doing sub-typing correctly, especially in regards to type inference.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual006.html#toc36"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual006.ht...</a><p>Haskell does not have polymorphic variants, unfortunately. Happily, we can add them in as syntax sugar over multiparameter typeclasses[2]. The very first example in section 1.2 of this paper is particularly relevant here: they're showing how polymorphic variants make it easy to work with different kinds of ASTs. I don't think this is necessarily an immediately practical approach, but it's very interesting from a language design point of view.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://guppy.eng.kagawa-u.ac.jp/~kagawa/PVH/PolymorphicVariantsInHaskell.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guppy.eng.kagawa-u.ac.jp/~kagawa/PVH/PolymorphicVaria...</a><p>Your last example sounds like a prime case for using GADTs[3] (along with data kinds). You could write a type something like:<p><pre><code>    data Typed = Checked | Unchecked\n\n    data AST ∷ Typed → ★ where\n      Checked'   ∷ Int → AST 'Checked\n      Unchecked' ∷ Int → AST 'Unchecked\n      Neutral    ∷ Int → AST a\n</code></pre>\nNow you can easily write functions expecting unchecked terms, checked terms or both. These functions will have type-checked pattern matching--you will only be able to match on cases for the appropriate type. The compiler can also do exhaustiveness checking based on the type. That is, if you write the following function:<p><pre><code>    checked ∷ AST 'Checked → Int\n    checked (Checked' i) = i\n</code></pre>\nyou will get a warning that you missed the Neutral pattern, but not the Unchecked' pattern. And if you <i>do</i> try to add the Unchecked' pattern, you will get a type error.<p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.6/html/users_guide/gadt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.6/html/users_guide/gadt.ht...</a><p>This approach gives you relatively little syntactic overhead at the use site--the appropriate type is chosen based on the constructors you used.

The prosecutor has a full pipeline ensuring his/her job. The judge likely doesn't even need to see a single case in a week.<p>There is no way out. Talking about it doesn't help because anyone who takes a plea is assumed to be guilty: ""Yeah he wasn't found guilty, but he must have done something otherwise why would he take a deal instead of go to trial?""<p>That is the way the layman thinks. If I was to tell you that I was arrested for walking in a room a <i>police officer</i> told me to walk into, you'd laugh and say I was lying. But it's true. And I had to plea out of it. Because it's my word against his. And I took a plea after he tried to steal $400 from me and burned my watch while I was in custody.<p>The government is a mechanism for satisfying bullies.

I would much rather have statistics on 100 measurements of .1s each, which would make clear the impact of such anomalies (while still being faster to gather).  There are many events that can make such measurements slower, but almost none that can make them faster; the distribution of the measurements is typically well-modeled by a Poisson distribution with bias.  If one is actually trying to eliminate the effect of those events from the measurement, taking the minimum over many short samples is actually much closer to the truth than averaging over one long sample.

It is trivially simple to dismiss luck as a huge factor due to our own egos being in the way, and the fact that these people were so publicly adamant about their lucky streak suggests to me a level of humility rarely seen in that echelon of executive power.",1369065732

This sounds like the final removal of roaming fees altogether - remember in Europe you do not pay to /receive/ calls in your home area unlike the US & Canada so it is a bit of an anomaly to have roaming fees for receiving calls when you move around the EU.<p>Of course, the roaming fees /outside/ Europe are now eye-watering.",1369065692

Allowing users to showcase how they tuned their cars would make it something like a facebook for cars. Featured cars could be a simple slightly random spotlighting of a few cars that are in the top ~30% upvote ranks.<p>Right now it looks like it is geared towards the ""Ohh shiny! Lemme get my camera!"" crowd than the ""Here is the work of art I poured my blood swear and tears into!"" types.

Have you tried to make GIF compression lossy?<p>The idea is that when looking for longest match in the dictionary you don't match colors exactly, but instead allow some difference. That can reduce file size by 20-30% (here's my take on it in C: <a href=""https://github.com/pornel/giflossy/commit/5a9adbc0feb899a228ed068a0deec6fc1b954a85?w=1#L0L245"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pornel/giflossy/commit/5a9adbc0feb899a228...</a>)<p>Another optimization is to set pixels that are similar between frames to transparent color. That sometimes massively improves quality, as you only generate palette for part of the image (so the palette is better) and several frames overlaid together may give more than 256 colors.",1369065667

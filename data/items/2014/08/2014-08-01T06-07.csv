Reliability of those accounts varies per broker but some I understand to be quite good (never bought any myself).<p>Hang out on any blackhat SEO forum (or more illegal carding shops, etc. I would imagine) and you&#x27;ll see plenty of guys peddling this service.<p>Incidentally, the youtube method you&#x27;re describing has been automated many times. My first real PHP project was a script that found popular videos on non-youtube sites, downloaded them, watermarked them with my blog URL, and uploaded them to youtube. That resulted in a fair amount of direct traffic.<p>If you trawl around youtube these days you&#x27;ll see plenty of watermarked videos that are clearly not original content. But as long as nobody is claiming copyright -- which nobody is doing for cat videos -- Google doesn&#x27;t give a shit. Honestly, uploading non-original videos to Youtube only helps their numbers.<p>I think a common misconception is that companies care about fake/&quot;spam&quot; user accounts on their services. But what incentive do they actually have to ban them? In the world of venture capital, user numbers are an incredibly important metric, so as long as they aren&#x27;t actively diluting the service for other users, companies have an incentive to allow them to propagate and pad their stats.<p>Take Snapchat for example. Looking at my friend request page, I have dozens of obviously spam accounts asking to be my friends. Is Snapchat including these accounts in their user numbers? Almost definitely. In fact, they probably even count as &quot;active users&quot; because they are &quot;sharing photos&quot; so often!<p>One has to wonder how many popular services have been built on VC money given to them on the presumption of accurate user statistics, when in reality 20-30% of accounts could be shills. Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook... There are tons of fake users on all of them, and yet these companies make relatively little effort to exclude them from stats (except, of course, when reporting monetization per user).",1406875930

They have pointed out that a few laws refer to &quot;newspapers&quot; and some small adjustments should be made to include online sources too.<p>The report mentions a few cases where companies operate in a country but don&#x27;t wish to obey the laws of that country - they mention Twitter in France refusing to divulge the identity of posters making anti-semitic posts (even when given validly formed court orders).<p>> 80.  Those rules can be admirable: Facebook has a real name culture, a set of community standards (e.g. regarding nudity), enables people to control their own privacy, and enables the reporting of abuse;[32] Twitter have rules against threats of violence, targeted harassment and similar issues. Other operators are less responsible. Irrespective of the responsibility of the website operators, the behaviour with which we are concerned is criminal.<p>Gentle pet peeve here but Facebook is a poor example: You can&#x27;t show a woman breast feeding but you can show a woman having her head cut off?<p>One thing the submitted article doesn&#x27;t mention is how much time the police spend dealing with online stuff.

But limited &quot;shared-nothing&quot; threads are in principle possible, though may not be very useful (I could think of couple of use cases, but many of these cases can be solved by different means too).<p>As for cursors - Zend Engine actually supports both internal and external cursors for arrays, but there&#x27;s no user-level access to that. Extensions though use it all the time. So given threading would be implemented on C level, it could potentially use external cursors. Though, as I mentioned, there would be problems well beyond cursors to deal with in that case. E.g., since arrays are mutable, one would be first required to ensure both threads actually somehow accessing the same object and it hasn&#x27;t disappeared or mutated unrecognizably from under them. <i>That</i> would require much more effort than a couple of cursors.",1406874151

8118581,comment,8117348,8118261,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Once you eliminate the problem of patent trolls, you realize that the idea behind software patents is sound and actually promotes innovation, start ups and entrepreneurship.<p>Eliminating patent trolls would eliminate that problem for large corporations, although it would still cost them million of dollars to apply for patents solely to cancel out others&#x27; patents through cross-licensing. Start ups are even more screwed because all of the large incumbents still each have a huge arsenal of broad software patents and can bury any software start up in litigation who tries to compete with them. This also makes having a software patent essentially useless for a start up because any attempt to assert it against an incumbent would only result in counterclaims and ruinous litigation costs. The idea that a small <i>practicing entity</i> can realistically assert a software patent against a large tech corporation is beyond belief. And that&#x27;s before you even consider the six-figure cost of paying lawyers to get a patent through the patent office, which then generally isn&#x27;t even issued until the technology at issue is either obsolete and disused or so common and ingrained in the status quo that issuing an effectively retroactive patent on it without prior notice to those who have since adopted it is inherently unreasonable.<p>Software patents are fundamentally useless and should be abolished.",1406873867

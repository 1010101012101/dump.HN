9948591,comment,9946668,9948098,0,0,zanny,,,"This is the case with old code in general, though. 2003 Javascript, 2003 C++, any Java, especially 2003 C#, any C, 2003 Python, etc are all horrible messes to work with today. C++ got so much better with C++11/14 I can&#x27;t even think of it as the same language. Python literally broke itself. Java is pretty much dead except for on Android (consumer facing) for good reason. C# was practically an infant in 2003 and got so much better with so many frameworks around it since then. C is still as bad as ever, and Rust / Go didn&#x27;t exist, and Scala came out that year.<p>It is why frameworks and toolkits are so important. You want to minimize your codes aging surface area, and having individual parts you can manage and age independently kicks the pants off of starting from int main() and hoping for the best. Wesnoth&#x27;s greatest library dependency is SDL, which honestly should make the engine fairly futureproof if they could get it ported to SDL2. But that doesn&#x27;t change how everything else is pretty much raw C++, with just AI rules in Python or Lua.<p>I&#x27;d have to look into if they are giving a thumbs up to std=c++14 or not, because if they are I might go poke around just to see how much you can fix. I&#x27;ll have to read more on that though.",1437850742

9948542,comment,9947146,9947146,0,0,zanny,,,"So nobody is talking about Plasma Active.<p><a href=""http://plasma-active.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plasma-active.org/</a><p>Some history, Plasma Active is about five years old now and its development coincided with a would-have-been-crowdfunded-toay tablet called Vivaldi that was supposed to be an open hardware device that never panned out because costs got out of control and interest waned.<p>It was based on Mer, rather than Kubuntu, and Qt4 rather than 5. Today it looks like a colossal wreck, and all the &quot;Active&quot; app UIs developed for it are all complete wastes of code and time today because QML was not mature enough when they made that &quot;first attempt&quot;. Today there are common themed QML elements called the qt-quick-controls that everyone can use to build UIs that adapt to every devices native toolkit, while still supporting animations and flow elements and all the nice graphical perks hardware accelerated UIs allow.<p>Its been basically dead in the water for over two years, since the tablet project went belly up, and there even used to be a &quot;Kubuntu-active&quot; fork of Kubuntu that the project was maintaining as a way to try out the Plasma Active desktop on top of a Kubuntu core. The shell from Plasma Active did eventually see use in its adoption as the &quot;netbook&quot; interface found in Plasma 4 near the end of its lifecycle.<p>So you definitely want some post-mortum on the last KDE mobile attempt and you also want to consider how Plasma Mobile might succeed or fail in a similar vein.<p>Why did Plasma Active basically never do anything? Number one, no device support. It was not targeting phones at the time, and was instead looking towards tablets, but it never even ran properly on a Nexus 7 and those only turned up while it was on the decline. Without hardware, software is useless. This time around Plasma Mobile is shipping for the Nexus 5 out of the gate, a significant improvement. If they can make images for popular dev phones for a while, they will certainly have more potential devs than Active ever did, which pretty much amounted to building and running the shell in a child Kwin to tinker with, but never use on an actual device.<p>Number two, its UI was a wreck. This was before the KDE VDG, Breeze, and Material Design were a thing, so Plasma Active was built on ugly Oxygen and Active Apps were made with effectively prototype QML1 where you had to write your own button class. As a result, all the apps not made for Active (and most weren&#x27;t, since it was dead in the water) were their desktop versions and unusable on small touch screens, and all the Active apps looked like you drew some rectangles on a white background you could click because that is literally how you made buttons in QML1.<p>Plasma Mobile does improve on this as well. Breeze, the new KDE theme, beats the pants out of their older defaults. They now have a KDE font, and a KDE icon theme meant to encompass everything, that are all consistent. they now have their visual design group making mockups and directing design for new apps and old, though there is an obvious schism between designers making mockups and anyone actually implementing them - there is an amazing Muon design that was never implemented into the final product which looks and feels like butt. And <i>not a single core KDE app in the KDE Software releases</i> is shipping a QML2 powered UI that is meant for mobile that uses a common design language like Material. It means all the core KDE apps - Kontact, Dolphin, whatever web browser you want to use (Rekonq is dead, Konqeror is a zombie, and there are several new projects out there - for mobile, you might be able to get away with a dumb qtwebengine wrapper), Amarok (which also has another amazing VDG UI floating around that is still unimplemented), Dragon Player, etc. They all need mobile UIs, none of them have them now, and you wouldn&#x27;t even want to make a mobile UI, you would want to make adaptive UIs - you would want all these programs to be able to scale from phone size to desktop size and readjust their layouts accordingly, because that is what QML2 is really good at. Its also a complexity nightmare, if anyone has tried a responsive website, albeit QML2 does so much of a better job equipping you with the tools to do that its almost not comparable.<p>Lastly, Plasma Active never had an app store. At all. Muon was still in its infancy back then, so you were using... Apper. Which is basically a worse Synaptic package manager, and Synaptic does not belong in the same room as a mobile phone UI. The newer appstream infrastructure and the future xdg-app tech should be great when it lands, but like I said before Muon is still a mess, though maybe that responsive adaptive UI redesign will also bring the VDG designs to the forefront finally and make it really great.<p>But Plasma Mobile supporting Ubuntu Touch Apps, Sailfish Apps, Firefox OS HTML5 apps, and Android apps with slashtik will definitely solve the app problem. Security might become a problem, then, though. You are now mixing debs, click packages, apks, app manifests, and RPMs from Sailfish on one system. Sounds like a giant mess. So do you just containerize everything? Good luck with that limited mobile phone storage and memory size. How does apparmor integrate with that mess? How about how Muon integrates knewstuff content from kdelook and kdeapps - those are literally just zipfiles it extracts into predetermined locations.<p>A lot of questions, but as long as they don&#x27;t go over their heads and stay within their manpower - which if Active is any indication is that you really just need a core base working great before trying to take over the world - it should have much more potential than the last KDE foray into mobile.<p>The dream, of course, is that Sailfish / Ubuntu Touch / Firefox OS all eventually rebase off Plasma Mobile and just provide their own UI shells over it, so that all the major open source mobile players are working in one ecosystem rather than working in their own trees at their own companies not trying to play ball with the competition. Good luck with that one.",1437849902

Libav sounds like it&#x27;s strict about good software practices and merciless in its exclusion and deletion of &quot;bad&quot; code. This may make a cleaner, more sustainable product over the long term, but it makes compatibility a nightmare now, which is probably why distro managers are increasingly interested in swapping libav back out.

Since libav aggressively deletes old stuff and painstakingly reviews each patch (according to this article, no direct experience), they don&#x27;t merge a lot of &quot;new stuff&quot; from ffmpeg.<p>ffmpeg has maintained compatibility, making it really easy for downstream users and distro maintainers to keep going, whilst continuously adding new features and improvements, including aggressively merging those placed in libav (I guess as long as they aren&#x27;t deletions or cleanups?).<p>I feel like there&#x27;s a lot to learn in this whole drama and that it hasn&#x27;t been very deeply explored. libav team originally claimed that ffmpeg&#x27;s leadership had gone dark/fallen off the map, but they sure came back quickly to express discontentment at the mutiny. libav team undoubtedly has talented people working on it (wasn&#x27;t DarkShikari on the libav side of the schism?) and libav/ffmpeg share a lot of goals.

There&#x27;s a lot of ways to make good waffles, where good is defined as tastes great, crispy, browned nicely, etc. You can tinker with the browning in a few different ways, you can tinker with how to get them to be light and fluffy, you can tinker with the flavor. Other than flour and water, almost nothing is absolutely required, but you have to have _some_ of the other things, and in the right proportions, or you&#x27;re going to have a crappy breakfast.<p>It seems like in both waffles and startups some recipes are more robust than others.

9948415,comment,9948144,9948144,0,0,discardorama,,,"FTA: &quot;In the late 1930s, there were just under 12,000 medallions in circulation; more than 75 years later, in a city larger by one million people and benefiting from far greater prosperity, there are only 13,000.&quot;<p>Population growth alone would require another 600 medallions. But remember: in the 1930s, we were just coming out (or on the upswing) of the Great Recession; so affluence would dictate a much larger number. So why is the number so low?<p>> Instead, arcane aspects of state and local law and, crucially, the power wielded by wealthy and politically generous fleet owners — <i>who don’t want to see the creation of more medallions lest the value of theirs decline</i> — make that [more medallions] virtually impossible.<p>There you have it. It is, for the lack of a better word, greed. When you have hedgefunds owning medallions[1], you know it&#x27;s a bad sign. Essential services for the general populace should <i>not</i> be a vehicle for hedge funds.<p>An ideal (or, a better) system would be responsive. It would look at how busy cabs are, and accordingly change the number of medallions in circulation.
Every year (or every <i>n</i>th year, take your pick), have a Dutch auction[2] of the desired number of medallions. Disallow renting of medallions (only the owner gets to drive the cab), which will kill speculation. Put an app around the whole system, so users can hail cabs from their mobile devices. Pain eased.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303653004579214314123978606"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100014240527023036530045792143...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_auction</a>",1437847762

It recently released Version 5, which is very pretty and a lot of people like it. This is a mobile version of it, which I guess is similar to what the Plasma Active / Plasma Netbook projects were - reskins of the shell for smaller screens.<p>KWin is the KDE window manager. It recently got Wayland support, which is the next generation display protocol of the Linux desktop. Gnome also supports it now, so it will be replacing the 3 decade old Xorg server which is a security nightmare and major impediment to getting graphical GNU/Linux on more devices.<p>Ofono is a free software telephony library, so that you don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel to support phone calls on phones. Its part of why Android distributions are so different from Linux ones - each vendor provides the full telephony stack guts, and while Android provides call APIs pretty much every system component in the phone is a binary blob shipped on the stock ROM images that developers need to copy off to ship a custom ROM. Which is why you download one Ubuntu for x86_64 but there are dozens of Cyanogenmod images for all the devices they support.<p>Telepathy is a messaging framework used by Jolla, Gnome, and KDE. It supports a wide variety of protocols, from XMPP to SIP to libpurple (which means yahoo messenger / aim / msm support amongst others) and newer messaging providers like telegram or tox. You basically import the library and you can provide one UI to dozens of messaging / file transfer / voice or video call services.<p>Coming up short on what RIL or OHM are abbreviations for in this context, though.<p>Its basically a tech listing, mostly to say &quot;this uses the stuff you already do rather than reinventing the wheel&quot;.",1437847503

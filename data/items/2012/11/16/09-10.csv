4793210,comment,4791295,4791750,5,0,yaantc,,,"This paper really looks like sensationalist attention grabbing material, and I'm kind of disappointed to read this in the MIT review without any context or critical analysis.<p>The synchronization signals in LTE are split in two parts, the PSS (P for Primary) and SSS (S for secondary). Both are using 62 LTE carriers, each one being 15 kHz, so cover 0.93 MHz. For comparison, a 3G channel is 5 MHz and a CDMA channel is 1.25 MHz. 2G is even narrower (memory fails me there...). So not widely different. And not using the whole channel bandwidth in LTE has very nice consequences: the phone doesn't need to know the channel size to synchronize (not the case in WiMAX for example), and the implementation can be lighter and more power efficient.<p>Then the paper pretends that transmitting a fake PSS would fool LTE devices. Nonsense. Any PSS detection algorithm has plenty of false detection already, and detecting a PSS is nothing until the matching SSS is also detected, with good quality. But then it's not so simple, the jammer don't transmit noise anymore: you have to transmit a true PSS/SSS pair. That won't get you very far, the UE will try this, won't find a matching BCCH and move on.\nAnd did I mention that this part is very robust? A UE can detect a cell well below the noise floor. That's required because in a real network with TD-LTE (and even for FD-LTE in the future) all the cells are synchronized and transmit PSS/SSS at (roughly) the same time. So it is expected that PSS/SSS will be interfered, and the device can deal with this. So you really have to transmit at a strong level to mess things.<p>But in the end, the point is that any public cellular technology is sensitive to jamming, and jamming is dead easy. To protect against this there are well known techniques used in military applications. But guess what? The whole system because way less efficient in capacity and much more complex. And capacity is key.<p>Optimizing a public system, where capacity is key, for typically non existing threats is just not practical. Everybody should realize this. If you want robustness to jamming use a military grade system, and pay the price.<p>Move along, nothing really interesting to see.",1353059996

We'll also give you a simply customisable forum front-end in Django. You can take the Django front-end and host it yourself if you want, and butcher it to your heart's content... making it whatever you want it to be, and we continue to solve the storage, searching, problems via the API.<p>In essence, there's two parts to it. One part extensible (the API), and the other part 100% within your control (the front end web app).<p>But if you're not technically inclined and just wanted a forum already, then you got that in 30 seconds and it was really simple to change the look and feel so that your community has it's own strong identity.<p>We actually see a far bigger market in the space of the non-technical wanting forums.

It could only be true for a very small subset of web developers (freelancers who are working in a variety of languages for many clients), and even then it smacks more of post-hoc justifications for activity like reading blogs and doing 'research' rather than concrete need. What advantages does reading industry blogs each day really give you? What disadvantages does it have (less time for real work)? There is a strange confusion here between work and play, and the silly illustrations accompanying the post don't help its credibility. Given the hyperbole and excited ignorance that passes for insight on most blogs, I'd say it has negative value to read them every day. Once a month would easily work if you want to keep up to date with current trends, but learning a new language each month as a requirement to stay employed is absurd.<p>There are many kinds of web developer, but just to take a few examples of those who have no need to heavily invest in learning new languages every month:<p>The majority of web developers work in-house at a firm where the technology in use is mandated, and only changes slowly (and rightly so), because the business depends on it not breaking. They are not threatened at all by the rise of new technologies, and certainly not on the timescale of months.<p>Then there are many small web developers who make a good living installing, customising, and maintaining CMS systems like wordpress for a wide variety of clients. They don't need to change technologies every month, and frankly it's the last thing their customers want - these developers have chosen a specialisation and will probably stick with it for decades before changing.<p>Finally there are freelance developers who work on lots of different projects for lots of different clients. They have to stay a little bit more up to date, but the rate of change is measured in years, not months, and there is plenty of time (years) to shift to another platform if the one you have specialised in is not growing but shrinking in usage.

And it should be a message both for founders and backers.<p>What I get from the article is that this guys had an idea and 24 hours later they created the Kickstarter. This is partly wrong, what is totally wrong is people supporting them(please note this is just my opinion) because you can find everywhere cheap shirts, even good ones. There a huge market about it what would make you think that some random guy can do better? Just because they say so? If this would make any money companies would have already adopted this.<p>When approaching Kickstarter I think one(with an idea or a prototype) should make it clear what he wants to achieve without the ""I will make the best at the lowest price"" attitude. Remember the users that backing the project it's a donation with a possible gift and not a preorder. Also you should have thought about it more than 1 day. The day you realize that you can't maintain your promises your reputation might end up destroyed.<p>I think that it's important that we use Kickstarter the correct way because we risk ruining it, when too many people will realize that they will not get what they paid for people will not use it any more, resulting a bad reputation for kickstarter and therefore other projects that might be worth checking.",1353057767

In terms of style you have a lot of ""I don't accept..."" and ""XYZ...serves a political agenda"" which are not counter-arguments, but rather non-falsifiable statements about your own beliefs. In particular, your beliefs about C=Politics. Its generally not helpful or interesting to jump the gun to C=politics, without working your way through the discussion of A,B first.[1]<p>____________________<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/waldo/2012/07/27/the-bozo-event-horizon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/waldo/2012/07/27/the-bozo-event...</a>",1353057028

4793078,comment,4791830,4792587,1,0,cristianpascu,,,"I still get the sense that this explanation goes backwards. It's like saying we got more intelligent because we were intelligent enough to develop writing, or proto-writing.<p>Sounds like something that grows out of itself. Neuro-electrical reaction to light, thermic or mechanical stimuli is not intelligence. Writing, sending messages, interpreting messages is intelligence. Heck, walking in random directions is intelligence.<p>Obviously, since we haven't yet explained consciousness in ""the brain is the mind"" fashion, we're still in reverse engineering mode. Thus the explanations will sound 'just so'-ish. Nevertheless, the questions is still there: why the sudden jump in progress.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a creationist, but always happy to hear alternative views.",1353056868
4793077,comment,4787266,4787585,2,0,flyinRyan,,,"Personally, I don't see how such a model can work.  By using this model you're spending millions to make a big game like LotR and then hoping that enough of your customer base will pay for <i>new</i> content.  But making new content itself is costing money and you haven't payed off the initial investment yet.  I don't see how you wouldn't always be chasing your tail with such a model unless your later additions are going to be really cheap to make and expensive to buy, but why would anyone buy that?  Just because the initial offering was free doesn't mean people are going to be willing to pay a lot more minor enhancements later.  If anything, you're probably escalating what it takes to spend money.",1353056863

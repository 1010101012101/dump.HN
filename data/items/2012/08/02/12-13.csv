4328419,comment,4328092,4328092,11,0,yaakov34,,,"A couple of notes about the limits of things that have already been reached today:<p>A pixel in a camera sensor has to be a couple of wavelengths in size. This is basically the size that we can make them now. There are also diffraction limits for any imaging system, and a size limit on the lens (if your lens is too small, its surface won't collect enough photons in low light to make an image - no matter how you focus them). So I don't think it would be possible to make a deep sub-millimeter camera with usable image quality, and I don't think the 10-order-of-magnitude gains in power efficiency will be coming, either (if you can't shrink it, you're stuck switching larger circuitry and dealing with larger charges). Now, spy cameras can already be annoyingly tiny, but I don't think we're headed for cameras on a speck of dust or some such. One piece of evidence for this is that tiny sub-millimeter insects have lost most or all of their vision - eyes don't scale well to these sizes.<p>Genome sequencing: I think there are limitations to what can be done with these that are already being hit. E.g. looking at the USB-attached genome reader that Charlie Stross mentions, I see that it really needs to have the material which you're feeding it to be separated into DNA/non-DNA fractions for decent performance (otherwise, the micropores will be deluged by non-DNA material), and it needs a conventional chemistry lab in order to cut something as large as a human genome into manageable chunks. For this you need things like centrifuges, which can't become microscopic. I think there are fundamental limits reached here as well, since you can't make a pore arbitrarily small (molecular-sized) without having all sorts of molecular junk jam into it, if it is present.",1343911378

So do not sweat over this thing.<p>Now, on the question of how to code/learn, I suggest you start with a small target/end goal. For example, ""Build  User management system"" or anything like that. Then, pick a language of your choice and start coding. While you do that, you will google 100s of things, read stackoverflow plenty of times and bang your head on the screen as well. But at the end, you will be happy when that code finally compiles and run successfully or you don't get a 500 error in the web app. Stick to that project, finish it off no matter how small it seems like. You will learn a lot in the process. I am doing exactly that right now with web programming/dev. using Python/Flask framework.

In other words, you could get acquitted of dealing drugs if the state's main evidence against you is something obtained through warrantless electronic surveillance, and that surveillance is illegal. And that's important.<p>But why is it important? It's important because it's small stuff, not the kind of stuff governments would throw national-level resources like NSA supercomputers at. So, the argument is really about the gaps, not the fringes. As far as terrorism and national security-type activities go, it seems to me they already have unlimited _de facto_ authority, capability, and inclination to spy on you all they want, and that this has more or less always been true.<p>Thus, I find that the rhetoric is a bit off. This isn't about stopping the government having ""access to your e-mails"". They already have that, in principle. With enough initiative and spiritual commitment, they can track you, read your e-mail, and listen to your voice communications.

What suggested fixes are there? are those proven to work? whats does the number says, do they show a trend?<p>Well, there's your problem. From what I can tell asking those questions is considered anti-feminist and evidence of misogyny. For instance, just to pick one example, there are various studies showing that an impressive proportion of men  actually admit to raping women. These get used as evidence of a rape culture in which men <i>specifically</i> - not just society as a whole, but men and men alone - consider it acceptable and normal to rape women. Now, since the studies in question didn't ask women whether they committed rape, they actually give you zero information about whether this is something that men do or something that everyone does. They're still used as ammunition to accuse anyone who treats rape as more gender-neutral of hating women and denying its tuge gendered nature. Meanwhile, the studies that would actually be required to test this - ones which make no up-front assumption and ask both men and women the same questions - don't exist, because even posing the question of whether women rape others in this way makes you a misogynist and is apparently a really bad career move.

People who have good rapport with their managers and are implicitly trusted will graduate to self-directed work within less than a year and be full-fledged ""intrapreneurs"" (i.e. have most of the autonomy that a startup founder would have, if not the same upside) within 2 or 3. You don't need a 20%-time policy to back that up. It naturally happens. So 20%-time policies exist to set a <i>minimum</i> on the allowance for self-directed work, but here's the problem: people who don't win the implicit trust of their managers get pissed off and disgusted-- regardless of whether they're working 32 or 40 or 50 hours per week-- and no side project can fix that: the only solution is for the employee to transfer before he burns out and gets fired.<p>A 20%-time policy dangles a carrot. It reminds the people who don't have autonomy and implicit trust of what their work lives would be like if they had better managers.<p>20%-time often becomes a negative space and a justification for reducing employee autonomy during the other 80%. You want to mentor interns? Maintain a legacy module you depend on? Work on a cross-hierarchical project (from a cynical manager's PoV, this looks like a careerist attempt to become a ""socialite"" within the company rather than remaining under one thumb)? That's what 20% time is for.<p>Also, 20% time might have been a real benefit in 1975 when average people didn't have access to a computer, but in 2012, most people would be happier just taking a day off to work on a side project. If you get fired or quit, you still have your side projects, but your 20%-time project ends up in /dev/null.<p>Finally, here's a dirty secret about what has happened in the professions. Until about 1980, it was typically understood that metered work (i.e. what your boss is directly asking you do to) expectations in the professions would be about 20 to 25 hours per week. A boss who asked for more than that, except with an aggressive once-in-a-career type deadline, was setting an unreasonable expectation. The other 20-25 hours were to be spent on off-meter work, such as networking, continued education, and research-oriented side projects that might not work out but would teach something in the process, all of which were intended to keep the professional current and improve his or her long-term career. After the slow-motion terrorist attack that was the Reagan era and aggressive corporate cost-cutting, that devolved. The new expectation, after that, became 40+ hours of <i>metered</i> work, and any off-meter work was to happen on your own time. (The consequence of this is that most professionals don't learn much and are replaced by younger versions of themselves when they burn out.) So ""20% time"" is just a ghost to remind us of what things were like back when the professions really were professions.",1343909196

Homebrew channel on Wii comes to mind- They have a great title sequence and the popping bubbles, but the homebrew app allowing you to install new games has to be added manually on the SD card. And it is buggy and the user experience leaves much to be desired. And then after you wait 20 minutes to download a game, your kid could accidentally delete it in 5 seconds because deletion is right there with the games on the menu. But, the biggest problem is that few are savvy enough to install the Wii Homebrew channel and an SD card doesn't come with the Wii anyway.<p>The only way OUYA is going to survive and thrive is if they can sell at Best Buy, Gamestop, etc. and if the device is easy to use, doesn't have a load of crap on it like the Roku, and is fast enough to support games people want to play. But on top of that- it better not have a sub-par interface.",1343909040

However, these thickeners require (1) a large amount of starch, and (2) have a large particle size.

But the general principle remains: the slide shoots backwards with equal force to the projectile.<p>And yeah, any sort of magnum cartridge (.357, .44, .50) is a beast because it has double the powder load. The .50 S&W in particular, as you mentioned, has so much recoil that it&#x27;s prone to double-firing (S&W even recommends that you only load 1 round at a time). But among standard handgun cartridges, I still think the .45 kicks a lot more than say, a 9mm. It&#x27;s also <i>just</i> big enough that you can&#x27;t really stagger the rounds in a magazine without making it super-wide; hence why a standard 1911 holds 8 (7+1) rounds and 9mm pistols of the same weight can hold 15+. I find a modern .45 like the USP (12 rounds) to be uncomfortably wide for me to hold; though a Glock 17 (9mm, 17 round mag) is fine. That definitely makes the recoil feel worse.",1424623032

But then again it was basically written by one guy under tight time pressure, so we can give them a break.

A program is then a transformation on a stream of operating system events into a stream of operating system commands, both represented as data. That&#x27;s pretty cool, because it makes it easy to write your program and then mock the operating system rather than actually touching the real world. The closest we have to this now is the &quot;interact&quot; function, which allows you to model your IO as a transformation of a stdin stream to a stdout stream.<p>Conal isn&#x27;t much convinced that monadic IO was the best solution to the IO problem. The idea that monadic IO is a &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;denotational&quot; way to interact with the real world is arguably pretty weak, and that&#x27;s the point of conal&#x27;s post here: if you take the idea to its logical conclusion, we might end up just concluding that cpp is pure and denotational.<p>Instead, conal has worked on FRP approaches to interacting with the real world which are pure and have a very denotational feel to them: you&#x27;re just writing down functions from time and a time-stamped stream of events. I still hold out enormous hope for this approach, but I&#x27;m not placing any bets on it.",1424621872

I just have to hang in there a little bit more&quot;. And it worked. That simple thought gave me something which stands between hope and curiosity. That simple thought made me feeling prepared to something good. They say you have to be always prepared to handle bad things, but sometimes we forget to be prepared for good things! With this in mind, I found the strength to continue living, which resulted into understanding what was the cause of my depression in the first place (I won&#x27;t tell you that either), and then one little step at a time, whitout even noticing it, I found myself living a happy life (...again).<p>I&#x27;m not a doctor but these practical things helped me a lot feeling AT LEAST alive during that time:<p>- math exercises; there is no way 2 + 2 is going to equal 5, do some simple math and enjoy the relief of dealing with something that works as expected everytime<p>- keep notes of what you do everyday; depression flattens your days, and it gets harder for you to distinguish yesterday from the the day before yesterday and this gets the whole thing harder<p>- write down some day-by-day to do list; simple things just to get to the end of the day with the feeling of having done everything that was supposed to be done<p>- turn off the computer; when in an alienation-prone mood, computers don&#x27;t help at all<p>- do not expect gratitude from other people; right now your mood cannot possibly rely on someone else! Do good things and forget about it. You have to be the only one to know how good you can do right now<p>And in the end, put yourself first. Yes, I said it, be egoist until you find out who are you now, what you want now, what you need now, and why you feel so crappy now. One day you&#x27;re going to be fine again, you just have to hang in there a little bit more.",1424621066

Fun!<p>Mainly we don&#x27;t pre-allocate because it&#x27;s built on top of existing components, and the existing components don&#x27;t do that.  The actual &quot;max size&quot; limit is configurable and we don&#x27;t really want to allocate the full max size for each list up front.  If you have 500,000 lists each with 3 40 byte elements (~60 MB total), it would be overkill to allocate 500,000 8 KB blocks (~4 GB total).<p>Ideally, we would automatically determine if the user is doing &quot;big operations&quot; then switch to a page-based approach versus smaller &quot;store as much data as compactly as possible&quot; approaches, but it&#x27;s just not done yet.",1424620920

It seems to me this hinges on an emotional (i.e. economically irrational) need of (upper?) middle class people to <i>feel</i> rich and too “important”.  Which is actually not a bad business model at all, tapping into people&#x27;s feelings.  It&#x27;s actually one of the best things to base a business on.<p>But I could be wrong.

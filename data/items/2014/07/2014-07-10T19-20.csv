Hardware is a much less forgiving medium than software:<p>- If your web application requires three times the resources you thought it would, you can easily add more servers. But a device that needs to fit in a USB key has hard limitations on size, memory, power dissipation, etc. You can&#x27;t ask people to carry around a briefcase-sized device (or even another phone-sized device) to hold their passwords.<p>- If your web application has a horrible bug, you can wake up your developers and have them fix it at 3:00 AM. If you find a bug in your embedded software after you ship, it can only be fixed by getting all your users to upgrade their software (assuming your embedded software is in flash memory, not in ROM).

The customer doesn&#x27;t have to be preoccupied about any backroom operations necessary to provide the service contracted. OTOH, when I pay Netflix I expect it to be able to provide the content, including having a link with enough capacity.<p>What Netflix is doing is &quot;bullying&quot; a bigger company into a less favorable deal in a negotiation table. Verizon now has to deal with customer pressure to make a deal sacrificing their profit/incurring in loss. That&#x27;s the way negotiations are made, you have to know who are the stakeholders, how can they affect the outcome and how can you act on them.

The do not call the server &quot;high speed verizon network service&quot;, they call it <i></i>internet<i></i> service because they know customers do not want access to verizon&#x27;s network, but the internet.<p>Also, verizon knows many of their customers <i>want</i> to watch netflix, and they certainly would rather watch a netflix video with 15 seconds of buffering for every minute of actual video (which, funny enough, is probably still less wasted time than in ad supported channels as such is supplied by verizon&#x27;s tv service). Thus, but fulfilling their promise to connect their customers to the internet via peering relationships to the parts of the <i>internet</i> that their customers demand, they are creating happy customers, how is that not mutually beneficial?<p>Lastly, you would have to be devoid of all pessimism to not believe this isn&#x27;t about money, but control. If you look at the money verizon is charging for these peering arrangements, is quite trivial to both netflix and verizon.

8016852,comment,8015566,8016713,1,0,pdabbadabba,,,"Fair enough. Given the unpopulatiry of legal realism these days (especially among nonlawyers!) I think it&#x27;s probably safe to assume that you just disagree about the clarity of the case. But maybe not -- I suppose jwise can speak for him/herself.<p>I take slight issue with your characterization of Aereo&#x27;s legal position, though (mostly having to do with your #2). The issue (as I understand it) was whether Aereo was infringing on the copyrights of the owners of broadcast TV content. Aereo was arguing neither that they were or were not like a cable company, because it could not possibly have helped them. If they were a cable company, they were SOL because they hadn&#x27;t been paying the compulsory licensing fee by which cable companies get the license to broadcast content. If they weren&#x27;t, this still would leave them in search of an explanation of why they weren&#x27;t infringing on broadcasters&#x27; copyright. Their strategy, therefore, was to argue that they were simply, in essence, renting a broadcast antenna to allow home viewers to time/place shift broadcast TV. The analogy to cable operators came into it because the Supreme Court concluded, on the basis of the treatment of cable companies under the Telecommunications Act, that congress intended for any such service -- regardless of what technological contrivance they might use -- to require a license.<p>Under this approach to the case, I think the outcome is a bit clearer against Aereo. This is not to say that I think the issue is at all an easy one.",1405022147

In reality, that&#x27;s backwards, and the motor simply stalls. (Full disclosure: I&#x27;m not an EE, but man a master electrician I knew thought it was funny.)<p>Back to the point. Consumers request data, and then expect it to arrive. Netflix offers a service that replies with enormous amounts of data for very little request data. Now, most sites are like this, but video is a caricature of the imbalance typically seen. And Netflix serves a _lot_ of video. So a quick Pareto diagram points right to Netflix for congestion. But none of that is preemptive - all of that data was requested from the Verizon side, and so the word pushing gets you downvoted.<p>It&#x27;s just that Netflix&#x27;s service is less like Newton&#x27;s equal and opposite force and more like Flubber.<p>But like all things, there&#x27;s more to it than just Netflix replying to requests with an asymptotic amount of data.

It stratifies the haves from the have-nots efficiently.)</i><p>Are you disputing that surge pricing increases supply? It should be trivially obvious that it does.<p>Your &quot;moral&quot; arguments only apply if you treat Uber as the sole provider of transportation. If Uber ever starts actually supplanting cabs, your argument will have some merit, but cab companies have not died off. They have a real competitor now, which I think is a good thing, and in markets like SF where the cab companies woefully underserved the population it&#x27;s now actually possible to reasonably get a ride. But the cabs still exist, with the same regulations as before.<p>If Uber disappeared overnight, the supply of cabs would not increase. The supply of overall transportation during a storm certainly would not increase. Given that Uber is an <i>addition</i> to the existing transportation infrastructure, and not a replacement, what exactly is the justification for claiming that Uber needs to abide by the same pricing regulation that regular cab companies obey? There&#x27;s a good argument for why <i>safety</i> regulations should apply to Uber, but that doesn&#x27;t apply to things like pricing. Regulation of pricing for cab companies is not a natural consequence of the fact that the cab companies are in the business of transportation; it&#x27;s a consequence of the fact that cab companies are seen as providing basic public infrastructure. Do you view Uber as basic public infrastructure? I don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t see how you can make a compelling argument for that position.",1405022091

Netflix is asking its own servers for the streaming video, which means they can control the volumes at which the data gets sent.<p>Netflix <i>could</i> ask for less data, in the form of lower quality streams, but have intentionally decided to ask for, at all times, the highest possible video quality possible.  In fact, they&#x27;re so intent on sending as much data as possible, that they&#x27;ve begun rolling out 4k quality videos of more and more of their content.<p>It&#x27;s just important to recognize that it&#x27;s not like Netflix has no control over these request volumes, because it&#x27;s their software that&#x27;s making the requests.

At worst, they risk heavy metal poisoning (as Uranium has effects similar to lead on the human body.)<p>It takes a lot to make an effective weapon out of Uranium. Building a working device requires separating the incredibly rare heavier isotope U-238 from all of the mostly inert U-235. That&#x27;s what all the controversy about centrifuges in Iran was about: That&#x27;s the kind of equipment you need to extract fissionable 238 to make a weapon.<p>Uranium isn&#x27;t even radioactive enough to cause the kind of threat you assume. Materials like Cobalt-60 are far more dangerous, and are the real concern about &quot;dirty bombs,&quot; (explosive devices that spread radioactive material, as opposed to a nuclear bomb) but it&#x27;s far harder to work with, and it&#x27;s more carefully regulated. The effect of Cobalt-60 without adequate shielding is cancer and eventually radiation sickness.<p>By contrast, the effect of raw Uranium is... to release small amounts of ionized helium gas over billions of years.",1405021794

That&#x27;s pretty much my basic definition of a luxury car service; if you can get equivalent behavior (i.e. transportation from point A to point B) at a cheaper price by using a taxi, then it&#x27;s a luxury. But if it&#x27;s not necessarily cheaper to use a taxi, then I would agree it&#x27;s not necessarily a luxury service.<p>Uber (the black car option) in SF is significantly more expensive than a taxi (or UberX, which is cheaper than a taxi, even at low surges). My belief was the Uber black car service was roughly equivalent everywhere. Are you saying an Uber black car in NYC is not actually necessarily more expensive?<p>I am surprised to hear they enabled UberX in NYC. I would expect it to be a disaster, just as you said. Originally UberX was either an appeal to being green (due to hybrids), or simply a cheaper alternative to Uber, but it started out intentionally more expensive than taxis (they even raised the price at one point, citing the fact that it was unintentionally cheaper than taxis for some rides). But they&#x27;ve since changed course, turning UberX into the cheapest service they can. I&#x27;m not really sure what their goal is with that, but I can&#x27;t imagine it makes taxi companies happy. So I assumed they were only doing it in cities where they didn&#x27;t rely on taxis to fill rides. But as per your earlier comments, it sounds like being a taxi dispatch service is a big part of Uber&#x27;s NYC offerings, and it&#x27;s pretty obvious that UberX would interfere with that. And given the large number of cabs already in NYC, it&#x27;s hard to argue that customers will eschew cabs in favor of UberX, when UberX is the brand new service and cabs are the existing regulated service that already fills their needs.<p>My best guess here is that Uber&#x27;s CEO is intentionally trying to replace taxis with the UberX service, because that&#x27;s the only thing that really explains introducing UberX into a market like NYC. But that seems rather foolish to me. It certainly works in SF where the cabs are so scarce, but I can&#x27;t imagine it working in NYC, or e.g. London (where AIUI cab drivers have to pass an extremely rigorous knowledge test, a test that UberX drivers would presumably fail quite horribly, so passengers are already used to cab drivers knowing how to get places that UberX wouldn&#x27;t know).",1405020799

Not access to Netflix&#x27;s network. Verizon will has transit agreements with some people to use it&#x27;s network and settlement free peering with other ISPs of similar size.<p>When I go to by transit from Verizon to host my website do I expect to get settlement free peering? Well, probably not because I am probably serving much more content than I am consuming, as such my link is unbalanced.<p>If instead I was another ISP and I was sending roughly as much data to Verizon as I am consuming it suddenly becomes mutually beneficial for us to agree to send traffic for free as then we don&#x27;t each have to pay transit costs for this traffic.<p>Not understanding this is why HN and other tech news outlets are in outrage. This is just how peering arrangements work. Unless your traffic is balanced you need to pay the cost of transit, simple as that.<p>Now, the reason Netflix is bitching is they -are- paying for transit.. they just aren&#x27;t paying enough to the right people. Their problem is that their transit providers don&#x27;t have sufficiently large links to Verizons network.<p>Because of the massive asymetical nature of having Netflix on your network Verizon is not agreeing to settlement free peering to Layer 3 et al. Which is completely fair and how things work, unless it&#x27;s mutually beneficial you have to pay up.<p>Now, why does a witch hunt against those ISPs make no sense? Well simply put they are not running their network at 1:1 contention and probably charge prices that reflect that. If you went and bought carrier grade transit from more respectable providers chances are you would be getting 1:1 contention and these issues would never occur, but you probably pay more than 10x what Netflix is charging per mbit.<p>TLDR: Netflix doesn&#x27;t understand how telecom works and needs to pay for better transit.",1405019988

(I.e., that the correct legal rules are &quot;out there&quot; and that judges need only to &quot;discover&quot; them.) This is slightly different from the claim I think jwise is making: that it has always been the best interpretation of our existing body of law. The difference between this and classical legal realism is subtle, deep, and interesting (and, I hasten to add, contested!). And it is the subject of a vast and growing literature in the field of jurisprudence -- we call this (or a version of it) the &quot;Hart / Dworkin&quot; debate. As a starting point, have a look at Ronald Dworkin&#x27;s article &quot;Hard Cases.&quot;<p>The gist of Dworkin&#x27;s position (with which I mostly agree) is this: in many cases where the existing written body of law does not literally cover the facts of a given case, a judge often (indeed, almost always) is nonetheless not free to simply decide the case however she wants. There is typically a best interpretation of that existing body of law (you might think of it as the law&#x27;s &quot;spirit,&quot; I guess) that, itself, has something like the force of law in that it binds judges. Thus, anyone with sufficient training can look at a case, and look at the laws on the books, and tell what the rule is (even if sometimes the required training considerable -- well beyond the ken of any normal lawyer).<p>And while you are correct that most lawyers today are not &quot;legal realists&quot; I think it is also clear that most are &quot;Dworkinians&quot; in that, when a hard case like Aereo comes up, they don&#x27;t think that there simply is no rule yet, and that judges are free to do whatever they want. They see it as their task to educate the court about what the best interpretation of existing written law is and, thus, what the actual law is.",1405019693

We helped people with disabilities (i.e. motor, cognitive, etc.) use computers and be productive. Clients/Schools/Therapists would pay for a license and then expect/demand continual support forever and ever and the company I worked for didn&#x27;t factor in the support.<p>I love the work, I love the impact, and I would absolutely love to go back in and help, but until there&#x27;s a better (or even sustainable) pricing model I can&#x27;t go back because it&#x27;s unfair. I&#x27;m not even saying it&#x27;s unfair for the developer, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s unfair for the end-user because they have this expectation of what they&#x27;re getting for their money and when they don&#x27;t get it, they&#x27;ll feel cheated.<p>For example, we had clients who were upset when we could not support OS 9 systems (this was in 2011) - this would be the equivalent to expecting support for Windows 95. It was unrealistic, but our clients had been using the solution reliably for that many years and it literally became a way of life - upgrading could mean re-training a way of life.<p>In the App-based economy it&#x27;s simply expected that when someone pays $0.99 that the app will work on their phone for as long as they keep that phone. I&#x27;m amazed by the companies/developers who are able to make a <$5 &quot;work&quot;.",1405018933

The existence of the fine clearly shifted the equilibrium, but I wonder whether or not the introduction of the fine partway through the start of the year contributed anything to the increase of late parents. Redoing the experiment with the addition of a third group of daycare centers, where the fine is specifically laid out at the beginning of the year, might shed some insight into that?<p>[1]<a href=""http://rady.ucsd.edu.prx.us.teleport.to/faculty/directory/gneezy/pub/docs/fine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rady.ucsd.edu.prx.us.teleport.to/faculty/directory/gn...</a>",1405018883

Not just the &#x27;wealthy minority&#x27;. If we fixed airline tickets at $400 each and apportioned them lottery style we are ignoring that many business travelers would happily pay $600 for a certainty of getting a ticket and people of limited means would gladly trade time/travel flexibility for a $200 ticket.<p>Similar forces are at play with taxis. If you line up everyone waiting for a fixed number of taxis at a fixed price, you are ignoring that many people would pay more to skip the line. Paying more will increase the total number of available cars. Shortening the wait time for everyone.<p>People look at variable pricing as a way for &#x27;rich people to get everything&#x27; when it&#x27;s really about letting some people pay more to subsidize others who pay less.",1405018881

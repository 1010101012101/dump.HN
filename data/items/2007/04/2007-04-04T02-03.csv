8682,comment,8510,8578,0,0,notabel,,,"Good luck getting that degree accredited.[0]  You've entirely elided the fundamental aspect of education:  education.  A college degree is not supposed to just be a certification that you are competent over a certain domain of facts, but rather an indication that you have spent 3-4 years thinking, applying yourself, and growing intellectually.<p>While autodidactism is certainly laudable, there is value in a corporate educational setting, namely the value of intellectual interaction.  College is not so much about learning a set of data, but learning how to learn.  (For the ultimate example, consider the Ph.D., a degree meant only to teach you to do research, and requiring legitimate research to attain it.)<p>Now, I'll admit, I was educated in a liberal arts[1] high school, and am currently pursuing a couple of liberal arts degrees.  That is both why and because I believe education is about thinking, not committing facts to memory.  I eschew academic engineering because it is (at my university, at least) primarily a series of courses that certify your knowledge of yet another parcel of facts.  That is useless, educationally.  As technical training,[2] great, but it's not education.<p>Your list of ""why""s implies that, substantively, you were no different at the end of college than at the beginning, modulo a group of friends, and four years aging.  If that is the case, I'm terribly sorry; you managed to miss most of your education.<p>[0] Mea culpa: this entire comment is a bit hot-headed.  You've hit a pet peeve.
[1] Before you jump to conclusions:  the liberal arts include the hard sciences.
[2] In all honesty, that's what engineering school is: a vocational education in an incredibly advanced vocation.  (That's not a problem, really: I share my time between my liberal arts degrees and a fine arts program, which is also vocational education, in a (imho) advanced vocation.)",1175654283

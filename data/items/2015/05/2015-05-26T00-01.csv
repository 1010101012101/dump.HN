Banks don&#x27;t even really play arbitrage - not as a means to profit at least.<p>Only benefit to being a hedge-fund is you have lots of money to play with, which you&#x27;ll need because the profits in arbitrage are very thin.

9602371,comment,9602092,9602202,0,0,mdasen,,,"When people quote high revenue multiples, usually they&#x27;re in an area that they see high future growth.  Patrick&#x27;s writings on BCC make it seem like a business that is stable to declining.  Of course, as you point out, the low multiple (3x annual profits) means theoretically recouping the investment in three years (not including interest and opportunity cost).<p>Patrick posted that BCC&#x27;s 2014 sales declined 33% from 2013.  If sales keep declining at that rate, $19k turns into $13k for 2015 which turns into $9k for 2016, $6k for 2017, and $4k for 2018.  At that point, the business really isn&#x27;t generating much and it would take well over a decade to recoup even without accounting for interest and opportunity cost.<p>But it might level off.  It might go up if the new owner puts some love into it.  However, I think the most likely scenario is that revenue and profits continue to fall.  That&#x27;s not to say $57k is a bad deal for the site, but I don&#x27;t think it means easy-money.  It seems like a sane deal.<p>I think a buyer doing due diligence would have to look at the site, calculate (or guess) at a declining revenue curve assuming ~$12-18k in profits for 2015 and maybe seeing the rate of decline flatten out in the future and see some profits to be had.  I know, $19k/year with a $57k price-tag looks really appealing on paper and makes it seem like easy money ($19k/year forever!).  By Patrick&#x27;s own writings, BCC&#x27;s visits, sales, and revenue are all declining by a third year-over-year.  He hasn&#x27;t invested in the product for a while.  There will definitely be some auto-pilot money, but not $19k/year for three years.  It can still be a good deal.  It&#x27;s just important to go into deals eyes-open.<p>$57k seems like a fair price for BCC.  If the new owner does good marketing and customer acquisition, profits might level off quickly, but that also means really working on the project.  There&#x27;s a decent amount of risk in a project this small and so charging too much for it doesn&#x27;t really account for that risk and the current downward trend.  That said, it seems like a bit of work could go a long way and recoup the investment in the 5-10 year time-frame and make a reasonable amount of money.  It can be a good business, but it isn&#x27;t free money.<p>I think if the profits were stable year-over-year, Patrick wouldn&#x27;t be selling it (or he&#x27;d be selling it for a lot more money).  If it had brought in $19k/year since 2010 totally stable, I could see a six-figure price tag on the site (maybe $150k, maybe more).  But according to Patrick,  BCC &quot;has been on a steady decline since [2012/early 2013].  This decline accelerated in 2014.&quot;<p>* None of this is meant to be negative about patio11.  It&#x27;s just meant to be realistic about the likely future profits of BCC based on the decline noted by patio11 in his 2014 Year in Review: <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/12/22/kalzumeus-software-year-in-review-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/12/22/kalzumeus-software-year-...</a>.",1432601082

It&#x27;s an incredibly tricky thing to pull off and I don&#x27;t really think anyone has so far. What were you expecting in terms of design? It seems like it&#x27;s hands down the best watch with straps very well done. I prefer a circular look but then I can easily understand going for a regular look both technically (more hardware volume) and design wise (most information is displayed much better in rectangular form).<p>There&#x27;ll be a few iterations to make it nicer looking, can&#x27;t say they did a bad job.<p>About the rectangular/circular form thing... I think the problem may be calling it a smartwatch. A smartphone isn&#x27;t really a smartphone. It&#x27;s a portable all-in-one (built in screen, speakers, microphone etc) computer, whose telephone functionality happens to be the least interesting (and at one point shifting to voice over ip, meaning it&#x27;s as much a smartphone as your laptop or desktop computer is). Calling phones small tablets makes more sense, at least until recently when phones rival tablet sizes. But nobody really complains because the semantical evolution makes some sense and doesn&#x27;t cause any real friction. But with a smartwatch, people expect it to look like this [0] but it doesn&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s main function is not telling time. Its main function is being a wrist computer, which happens to also be able to tell time. And that wrist computer does things that fit better in a rectangular form, which creates friction with people to whom a rectangular watch happens to be pretty ugly.<p>Anyway I didn&#x27;t think the first iPhone was particularly pretty. I can&#x27;t say the apple watch is different. In today&#x27;s context it is nice in my opinion, just like the iphone was back then in comparison, but I still don&#x27;t want an apple watch right now. I&#x27;m happy to wait out the 2016-17 versions.<p>[0] <a href=""http://icdn8.digitaltrends.com/image/round-apple-watch-concept-2-1280x864.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icdn8.digitaltrends.com/image/round-apple-watch-conce...</a>",1432599850

There is ample video of various agencies of the federal government along with local and state law enforcement being used to prevent news organizations from filming the environmental impact across the gulf coast, and the Coast Guard was one of these.  I also believe that injecting nearly two million gallons of Corexit was done without regard for the impact on marine life; it was done to ensure that the oil would settle on the bottom of the gulf.  So less spoiled beaches was obviously good, but the impact on marine life and ecosystem made the spill much much worse.  Read the Wiki page on Corexit (FWIW, I have a degree in chemistry from UNC-CH).<p>And since you mentioned the Marine Economic Defense Zone (otherwise known as the Exclusive Economic Zone), this is presumably what entitled a Coast Guard cutter to board my sailboat about 3 NM off the coast of Bimini in international waters?

I&#x27;m absolutely going there for affordable labor on lower skill projects, but I&#x27;m not trying to get Facebook @ $100. A typical job would be for someone to do a basic template brochure website build (with all copy/structure mocked up) for $600-$1,000. Locally this would be $3-8k. That doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable to me for a cheaper country wage... though perhaps people would disagree.<p>As a client I find it tough to find guys that offer quality work.

The question is whether they just shrank the iPhone software - that&#x27;s what matters - and quite clearly, they didn&#x27;t. There are a few changes they could make but for a first generation product, they nailed it on so many levels.<p>Regarding aesthetics, clearly that&#x27;s subjective, but many traditional watch enthusiasts (such as Benjamin Clymer of Hodinkee and Ariel Adams of aBlogToWatch) have had a number of good things to say about the hardware design.<p>From Hodinkee&#x27;s fantastic Apple Watch piece[1]: &quot;Apple got more details right on their watch than the vast majority of Swiss and Asian brands do with similarly priced watches, and those details add up to a really impressive piece of design&quot;<p>Finally, to address your initial point, I see no evidence that his software taste is less refined, nor that his hardware work is getting lazy. iOS 7, which I suspect is what you&#x27;re referring to regarding his software taste, received some negative feedback when first unveiled but has since become well liked, albeit with a few lingering usability concerns, especially since they refined it with iOS 8. The Apple Watch bands alone are incredibly well designed, with a number of improvements over traditional watch bands that the Swiss ought to be ashamed they hadn&#x27;t invented yet[2]. I&#x27;ll give two examples.<p>1. If you&#x27;ve ever changed a leather watch band, you&#x27;ll know how much of a pain it is. Most people go to a watchmaker to change them. Apple Watch bands are easily interchangeable. How obvious, right? Yet nobody else does this.<p>2. If you&#x27;ve ever bought a watch with a metal link bracelet, you need to have it adjusted for you at the store. Why? Because you need a specialist tool to do it. If you ever need to change the size, you need to go into a store to get it readjusted[3]. Again, incredibly obvious to make this user interchangeable, yet nobody else did it.<p>If Ive was as lazy as you say, he would have been happy to use traditional watch bands, the type that every other watch and smartwatch uses, and require users to go into an Apple Store to change them or to adjust them. Two examples of great design, off the top of my head, just for watch bands - I can&#x27;t imagine how you think he&#x27;s lazy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review</a><p>[2] And this isn&#x27;t due to a lack of innovation. The Swiss (and watchmakers of other countries too) spend a lot of time sweating the details on watch straps, buckles and deployant clasps, e.g. <a href=""http://www.rolex.com/about-rolex/bracelets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rolex.com/about-rolex/bracelets.html</a><p>[3] In addition, the tools for this often proprietary or vary by brand.

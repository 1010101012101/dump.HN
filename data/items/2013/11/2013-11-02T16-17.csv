In the first chapter he challenges assumptions, for example how lib C code is not really optimally written (its written for portability and general purposes) and you can easily write more efficient algorithm to do the same.<p>The mindset of not being at mercy of the library is a powerful one, it inspires you to dig deeper and find out how things really work.

You could catch split-second views of the other floors as the elevator moved by. I wanted to read a story about someone who sees something through the elevator window on one of the floors--really just an image. What the main character sees, seems unimportant at the time, but they happen to remember it fairly vividly. As the day proceeds and the character keeps flashing back to that image and over time they realize that brief flash has all of the clues to solve whatever the main crisis of the book is. The character only realizes this in stages. So perhaps first, they realize that someone was knocking on the door 601, and that fact later on becomes interesting/surprising. Then maybe later on they somehow see a person on the street who was the person knocking on the door. And the story starts to come together. etc.",1383411236

The package is `myapp/domain/errors`, and `<i>domainError.ValidationError` is a concept shared by my persistence layer, as well as http handling layer, when a given entity is to be persisted, the backend might return a `</i>domainError.ValidationError`, or there may be a legitimate (connection lost, for example) error, so they are handled through a late call to infer the `err.(type)`, and switch modes based on whether it&#x27;s a validation error, something more fundamental, or simply nil.<p>Separating the notion of a validationError to something that can be propagated through your own microframework scales much better than this ad-hoc mechanism.

I get the sense that the approach of a business to performance review is critical to employee morale, to the tenor of their interactions with one another and to the long-term execution of the business.<p>In my own experience, I&#x27;ve witnessed forced/stacked ranking lead to serious, concrete difficulties for a company I worked for.

You can use a true story, the benefit of this being that there are no plot holes. Scandals are a good place to start, particularly if the true story involving real, living people is too libel-likely to be given an &#x27;honest&#x27; treatment. Scandals mired in waves of disinformation are pretty good too.<p>By taking the story out of the true context and setting it in another time and place you can possibly do a better job of telling the truth than you would be able to do otherwise.<p>For instance, you could take the Iran-Contra affair and set it in colonial times, as if it happened during the Opium Wars (for example). To get started you could start with the standard &#x27;Wikipedia&#x27; telling of events, search and replace your characters so &#x27;President Reagan&#x27; becomes &#x27;[King Whomever]&#x27;, same with dates, same with locations. This could then serve as your rough draft. You could then quickly establish if the story actually worked. Then you could tighten up the story a bit, get someone else to read it and see if they thought it &#x27;was true&#x27;. If so then you have got to a reasonable start point. Your full research could then begin, proper history stuff, filling in gaps and embroiderising as required. It is important that you learn more and more about your target time and place, you don&#x27;t want those who know better to see your work as horribly naive.<p>Some of your embroiderisation can be stuff that you cannot say in your &#x27;target&#x27; story, for instance I am sure there is an Israeli angle to the Iran-Contra story that, if told truthfully, would brand you anti-semitic, worse than Hitler etc. However, set in a different time and place you could write whatever was &#x27;true&#x27; as &#x27;fiction&#x27;.<p>There are other emergent properties of taking one story and time-warping it to somewhere else. The protagonists could get dehumanized, corrupted, revealed to be ruled by superstition and so on. Within the context of the true story and the morals of our times this might not be so evident. However, after the transposition, whatever it is that makes your characters (good and bad) may be a lot clearer to see. On the Iran-Contra example, you could take today&#x27;s arms-trade and how that corrupts power and put it in context of the slave-trade of yesteryear. In the &#x27;Opium Wars&#x27; example you could probably find a fit with indentured labour in India.<p>In summary, take a story you like, some history you know, mash it together and there you go, novel written.",1383409403

6659617,comment,6654796,6657221,2,0,CosmicShadow,,,"As a fellow UW CS grad, I&#x27;d like to say this is pretty on the button, except for the fact that I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s trivial to get into as you need very high marks and more, at least in the year I entered, which was the double cohort (grade 12 and 13 graduating at the same time).  My buddy had a 99 average in OAC (grade 13) in every math and science course, made top finals in Canada for every UW math contest, and did a whole slew of other impressive things and was still rejected for Computer Engineering, and this was and is still one of the smartest guys I know.  Later that summer they did grant him entrance luckily, but it was ridiculous that you needed such high marks to get in.  From a CS perspective though, the minimum marks required were like 10-15 points higher than the next top school from what I remember.<p>UW CS was the most brutal experience of my life and after 1 day of frosh week I realized every one I met was smarter and more accomplished than me.  You get the pride and confidence beaten out of you so quick it&#x27;s not funny.  I powered through and hated every minute of it, but I didn&#x27;t want to give up, I wanted to make it and show the world I could beat UW; it was the enemy.  Many people I knew quit or disappeared after 1 year or 2nd year, I wanted to quit, I had many crises, but I brute forced through, clawing to the minimum required average to stay in the program.  I was lucky to know at least a few others who were doing the same, which helped me feel not so alone.  You swallow your pride and do everything you can to stay afloat, even while others around you take 1 extra full course a term while doing a double major with no effort and you wonder why you are so stupid or what planet everyone is from.  We didn&#x27;t get reading week, we got reading days, sometimes only day.  You never got a summer break, only co-op, which was like a vacation compared to school, but it was the most useful thing of all I think.  Everything was theory, it was so abstract and real world useless at the time that it bended your mind, this bugged me the most as an entrepreneur.  By the end the work isn&#x27;t easier, you are just better at managing your time and knowing how to defeat the non-stop barrage of assignments.  You realize you should make more friends because some of the people that you always hated for having every answer first on the newsgroups, even outsmarting the TAs, was the guy who would be the top engineer at the best firms in no time, or that you can hire them and be unstoppable.  The non-stop shifting between co-op and school made it feel like you were doing 3 years of experiences per 1 year, so time felt so distorted and you grew that much faster.  Having the courage to move to a new city every 4 months and relearn everything also changes you.  You knew what kind of experience having a job was and how disjointed it was from school.  You learned what you didn&#x27;t want to do, you started using your schooling to try and improve work places, and by the end you felt very comfortable with your skills and your knowledge of how the real world works.  Pretty much everyone I knew had a job offer almost a year before graduating.<p>I think anyone else from UW would say the same thing, but during and for years after, being idle for more than an hour or two made you feel really really guilty, like you knew you should be working or making progress, and if you don&#x27;t lose that feeling, you can accomplish great things very quickly.  A weekend of relaxing was more stressful and unnerving than anything.  I think most people leave Waterloo after they graduate because they hate it so much, it was so brutal that the city itself becomes an incarnation of what you experienced.  It&#x27;s getting better now, but damn did I hate everything for a long time.  I beat it though, and I&#x27;m proud to say I survived.<p>I stuck around in Waterloo because I was an entrepreneur and I knew it was the best place to start a business.  I volunteered and ran entrepreneurship organizations, tried to start my own companies and made a huge network.  I flipped from hating Waterloo to loving it, and 10 years later I&#x27;m still here and running a funded startup.  I wished Velocity and the Communitech Hub and all the other great stuff going on now was here back when I was in school, but so glad it&#x27;s here now.  The smarts, determination, experience and energy of these student entrepreneurs combined with the guidance and support of the programs makes for a very fierce advantage.",1383408446

2. Groups (unless you cram 20 - 40 people in an airbnb room?) - this includes conferences, conventions, aircrew, functions, tour groups) (another large % of the business)<p>This assumes we&#x27;re talking about city hotels with a normal(ish) business mix, but individual travellers often don&#x27;t make up the largest portion of business for the hotel (this really does vary, but outside of pure tourist and transit areas it&#x27;s roughly accurate). Add into the mix the zoning and health & safety requirements, and I&#x27;m not sure you could call &quot;doomed&quot; just yet.<p>There is scope for (ahem) disruption in booking and distribution, which we already see - but the physical product is probably going to be around for some time. Sometimes, you just need a big building with lots of rooms...",1383408167

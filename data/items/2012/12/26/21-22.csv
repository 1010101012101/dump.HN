Foreign Exchange trading is still the reigning king of developer friendly trading environments because of the nearly limitless platforms and systems for traders; stocks and commodities will soon join them (though there are already highly technical systems in place).<p>This last bit is based on second-hand experience: Forex traders pay good money for data in the form of dashboards and widgets.  You don't have to write anything that allows the trader to actually make trades/open/close positions, but a personal friend took a few days off from his sys admin job to write a dashboard for the EUR/USD pair with technical analysis that can be published with one line of javascript.<p>It was licensed to a private client within a week for demoing purposes.

That is why I used the past tense, in fact. People often say ""oh it's just X"" where X has a lot of gaps and there is a tacit assumption they can and will be filled in some way that satisfies the question. I object to that. Often, what we calls physics today we often call fiction tomorrow. It even happens to Einstein and Hawking.<p><i>If philosophers can come up with a good explanation of qualia and consciousness etc</i><p>You have missed my point. It's not the explanation that I'm looking at. I'm looking at the subjective meaning a person finds in things. This is not a scientific question. If all there was to life is all things scientific I wouldn't care to be (or about being) alive.<p>But there is an understanding there that we can't model in physics or biology and may never. We can't model it in psychology to my satisfaction, a field meant to be on that very level. But in a subjective way, we do model it. We poke at it and get the answers we're talking about.

I feel it's quite clearly about drawing/enforcing boundaries, being able to say 'no', and the like. In my experience, there are a lot of people in SV (men, mostly -- partly because SV is male-dominated) who can learn a lot from this lesson.<p>First, the author refrains from blaming those who were taking advantage of his ""kindness"" (loose boundaries, really, but he framed it to himself as kindness for so long). Instead, he takes full responsibility for his own misapprehensions about how the world works -- not his father, not his college-friend-turned-boss, not anyone else. Today, when I read posts about people who undergo this specific epiphany -- ""nice guy syndrome"" if I can call it something -- it inevitably is accompanied by resentment: <i>other</i> people are cruel and manipulative, <i>women</i> are bitches who don't want nice guys, <i>investors</i> are sociopaths who just follow trends, etc.<p>Second, and related to the first -- this man did not act simply <i>in reaction</i> to his epiphany. He didn't simply swing the other way, as if to say ""well now I'll be a jerk to everyone else to punish them."" Instead, he continued to be generous and magnanimous, but he took responsibility for drawing and enforcing his own boundaries. And those boundaries still included room to be generous and charitable, but what he gained was the facility to <i>choose</i> those traits.<p>Previously, he felt compelled to oblige and unable to resist the impositions of others. Now, he has the power to choose not to oblige, and he still chooses to oblige when he feels drawn to do it. And when he doesn't, he now can turn down the request.<p>As I said earlier, I have seen a lot of men arrive at the particular revelation that what they perceive as a kind and generous nature is actually compliance and subservience -- and then simply shut off that valve in reaction. I greatly admire this author's example of maintaining the choice to be generous, while gaining the capacity to choose the direction of his generosity.",1356558040

4971043,comment,4969372,4970384,6,0,betterunix,,,"""Out of interest, can you elaborate on what exactly it is with C++ that you think makes it so scary that can't be avoided by adopting certain techniques (RAII for example)?""<p>The two biggest issues are (1) lots of undefined behavior and lots of complicated semantics and (2) the difficulties involved with handling errors.<p>The undefined behavior is something that Stroustrup justified by pointing to all the undefined behavior in C.  This is a poor response in my view, since there are undefined behaviors in C++ that could have been defined without breaking any compatibility with C; for example, the order in which function arguments are evaluated.  There are also things that were left unspecified for no apparent reason, such as a non-void function where some control paths have no return statement (which can be disastrous in C++ and can make debugging a giant pain).  When the standard cannot even rule out programs that could never be compiled into something sensible, the standard is deficient (especially when most compilers can issue a warning over this sort of things -- so why not just define it as a compile-time error?).<p>C++ also forces programmers to deal with complicated semantics as the default.  It may not seem like a big deal, but it is easy for a programmer to forget that ""1/3"" is not ""one third.""  It is also easy for a programmer to forget that ""x+1"" might actually have a value that is less than ""x.""  The problem here is that C++ makes these things the default, citing ""performance;"" it would be far better if the default were arbitrary-width types, smart pointer/smart array types, and other high-level types, with low-level types like ""32-bit integer"" or ""pointer to a character array"" requiring an explicit cast by the programmer.  Critical systems have failed because of obscure ""corner case"" semantics like integer overflows in the past; these also create vulnerabilities in software.<p>Error handling is a complete mess in C++.  Exceptions are OK, but they cannot be thrown from destructors, they should not be thrown from constructors, and there is no way to say, ""retry the operation that threw the exception"" -- exceptions destroy the entire stack, and so the client code is responsible for knowing how to retry things.  If you are in the middle of writing a record to a thumb drive and that thumb drive is removed, what do you do?  You cannot simply prompt the user to reinsert the drive, and then have the ""OK"" button cause the rest of the record to be written (unless the exception is thrown again because the thumb drive is not there), unless you want your IO library to open dialog windows (and so much for encapsulation).  That basically makes exceptions no better than checking return values, other than that exceptions are a little faster and cannot be ignored.<p>The situation with exceptions is so bad that even the C++ standard library requires some errors to just be ignored.  The standard IO classes, for example, are required to silently fail if there is an error closing an underlying file when the object is being destroyed.  This forces programs to explicitly invoke a member function to close the stream before destroying the object -- so what is the point of having a destructor at all?  Destructors have no good way to signal errors:  they cannot throw exceptions, they cannot return an error code, and the order in which destructors are called is undefined so they cannot set a global error flag -- so you can only put things in destructors that either never create errors or which can only create errors that are safe to ignore (can you think of any such errors?).<p>C++11 could have fixed this error handling problem:  they could have required that the stack only be unwound after the catch block ends, which would have both solved the destructor exception problem and opened the possibility of Lisp-style ""restarts.""  Unfortunately, the standards committee did nothing of the sort, and instead defined the default behavior of destructor exceptions to be ""abort the program.""  Here I was, thinking that ""abort"" was something that should only be called under the gravest of circumstances, yet a C++ program might abort because it was unable to write to a log file.  Typically, one will hear the argument that exceptions should only be called in ""exceptional"" situations, which we are meant to think only means situations that are grave enough that ""abort"" can be called -- yet the standard defines exceptions for errors that can be corrected and for which a program exit is not strictly necessary, like an attempt to write to a full disk (and lest you think that this is no big deal, I have seen people lose over a 24 hours' worth of work because a program exited when the disk was full -- and you definitely would not want a 911 dispatch system to shut down just because it could not write to a log file).<p>You point to the use of the Linux kernel in critical telecom and financial systems as if it were evidence that the Linux kernel can be relied upon.  I see the Linux kernel panic periodically.  I doubt you would be happy if your 911 call were dropped because some telecom equipment was suffering a kernel panic.  You see Linux in these places because technically better systems are too expensive and there are too few people who know how to configure and use those systems.",1356557878

They offer two-factor authentication (via Authy) which when you think about just how bad things could go if somebody got hold of your DNS Settings seems like something more registrars should do.<p>Biggest downside is that they are a little more expensive than GoDaddy or Namecheap, but I guess it's rounding errors in the scheme of things.<p><a href=""https://dnsimple.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dnsimple.com</a> or <a href=""https://dnsimple.com/r/1d932aeba20283"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dnsimple.com/r/1d932aeba20283</a> if you don't mind a referral code.",1356555849

I also agree that the 2.x versions of MongoDB have been a great step forward for stability and performance.<p>On the logging, not sure what you mean by the old logs get clobbered. Is this, perhaps, some house-cleaning job that you have on your server? When we stop/start processes, the logs are appended and keep going.<p>On the issues with primary/secondary and state changes, do you host your databases on Amazon? We have often found that when we have this issue, it was pinpointed back to some temporary intra-zone networking glitch with AWS ... either with their name resolution or a blip in one zone being unable to see another zone in the window of time that MongoDB has set for the response.<p>These often (if not all the time) go unreported by AWS until you get them to dig a bit and report back. We effectively utilize priority to keep the member we want as primary and if a state change does occur, it moves back once the full set is healthy again.",1356555798
4970888,comment,4968589,4968894,3,0,davidw,,,"Exactly.  One of the first people many Italians think of when they hear 'entrepreneur' is Berlusconi, whose 'big idea' wasn't something new or clever or otherwise particularly innovative, but a sneaky way around the state television monopoly.  I think it's an example that shows both sides of the coin: the oppressive state, and the ""entrepreneur"" being not an innovator, but someone good at bending the rules.  So yeah, that's probably where that comes from, but it's a vicious circle, because people look down on those who <i>are</i> doing something new and creative as well.",1356555784

In more application than people would like to acknowledge, slowing down to the point of unusability can be as much of a dangerous result as crashing with a null pointer. Slowness has been standard quality of Python and Ruby development as much as null pointers have been a standard quality of c/c++ development. Either can be avoided with proper care but these all somewhat different failure modes.<p>The one thing is that c++ do present a different kind of security risk than Ruby/Python slow-downs or even Ruby/Python crashes.

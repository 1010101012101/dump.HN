And I seem to recall Marco (one of the lead designers of Tumblr) - making a jab at Paul Graham at some point - though I might be making that latter bit up, since Marco jabs at a lot of people, which is why his blog is such a fun read.<p>Is there some enmity between the two sets of developers? Is it a Boston-versus-NY thing?",1221487180

304618,comment,304226,304431,0,0,lbrandy,,,"So I work at a face recognition start-up.... and the answer to your question is ""Yes, but your mileage may vary"". Face recognition algorithms in the wild vary in quality by absurd margins. I know our stuff can do a pretty good job of it (because I've done it, internally).<p>There are websites that are trying to do it. There is a need, however, for local applications that do it (so people aren't uploading all their photos to the web). The real problem is the actual business-case for creating such a product, especially from our perspective. We don't want to make a full-fledged photo application. So how about a plugin? Would people buy it? Should we give it away? Do photo-sharing applications provide a good way for us interface our metadata? etc. etc.<p>I'm pretty sure if you gave our program a bunch of images, and we gave you an xml file with all the identities, you wouldn't be impressed. So we need a way of interacting with your photosharing application. And photo-sharing applications as ""platforms"" for plugins don't exactly inspire confidence.",1221486865
304617,comment,303193,303537,0,0,unalone,,,"I know it's bad to say this here, but I'm not really that eager to see rich Internet apps. It adds a layer of abstraction that doesn't need to be there, and I think development suffers when you're doing an Internet app rather than a desktop one.<p>I think the better solution is making desktop apps that emulate Internet apps. It's faster for the end user and it takes less effort for the developer. I think MobileMe is a perfect example of that. Make a powerful Internet app - but when you're not USING the Internet, just make sure it syncs with whatever app you're USING for your stuff.",1221486775

304612,comment,304303,304592,0,0,maxklein,,,"The question is not if I CAN. Yes, I surely can hunt deer in that manner, but it's not very clever. And our advantage is that we are clever, not that we are physically superior.<p>If this endurance approach were really an effective hunting mechanism, then why are there no animals doing this? There is no need to have a huge expensive brain if all you need is just lithe enduring figures and an efficient gait.<p>And I once went antelope 'hunting'. You know what happens when they see you? The run, really quickly and they completely disappear from sight. You have no frickin idea where they are anymore.<p>Only in really huge savannas that are completely flat and with very low grass can you keep your eye on one animal and just follow it.<p>This whole idea of endurance hunting does not sit well with me.<p>The influence of the second world war on genetic culling, in my opinion, was pretty minimal. The second world war was really not survival of the fittest, it was survival of the luckiest. First of all, the physically fittest were most likely to die, because they were fighting in the front. And even among those fighting, how fit you are hardly had an influence on your death. Bombs and guns and falling buildings are not affected by muscle size.<p>And your other statement about unfit males being killed by other males is just plain old dumb. Where did you read that nonsense? Humans are dominant because of social structure and tool handling, and not because of physical strength. Any human society that selected for physical fitness would decay very quickly.",1221486542

Detecting age and gender for demographic-based advertising is possibly feasible.. beyond that.. I have my doubts. Especially at Dunkin' Donuts price point.<p>The second part is probably also true, but if you think that's true industry wide, feel free to drop by our offices in Pittsburgh (www.pittpatt.com).

The idea of a port made the business founder nervous, and she wanted someone to tell her it was ok.<p>So in a conference call, architecture guy hedged and spoke in generalities and tentatively endorsed the developer consensus, which was the best he could have done if he'd been the greatest hacker on earth, since business founder was being silly about protecting <i>the idea</i> and wouldn't tell him what exactly we were doing or let him look at the code base.<p>It wasn't until after the important decision was made that he signed an NDA and produced the bad code.

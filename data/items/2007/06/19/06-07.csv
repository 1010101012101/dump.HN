29135,comment,29098,29098,0,0,elq,,,"Well... there's a broad spectrum of startup ""types"" - everything from ""supplement my income, maybe replace it in the future"" to full bore ""VC funded, have to grow like cancer or we'll die"".<p>If your idea fits in the the former class of startup convincing a spouse should theoretically be fairly easy - just set boundaries on time spent on your idea and make sure she gets plenty of time too; but I can't speak from experience here.<p>If your idea is closer to the latter or anything like a ""typical"" startup, good luck. An environment like that is going to be hard on _everybody_ in any close relationship with you. In my last startup, one of my employee's marriage came very close to failing due to the pressure... and he wasn't nearly doing the hours that the founders were doing.<p>Are you sure you'd want to do that to your wife?",1182235012

An inventor, a creator, a leader, now those attributes are better topics to write than coders.",1182235003
29133,comment,29098,29112,0,0,maliciouskitty,,,"On the other hand, I run a little online shop with my girlfriend, that is getting pretty respectable income: I handle the technical things, and she handles the customer services/inventory/shipping stuff.<p>It surely beats working for somebody else: more time to spend together, less grunt work and potentially more income too. <p>You do not need VC/Angel funding for your startup... it is definitely possible to grow your business, have a life and be rich at the same time. Don't be ruled by the 'Tyranny of Or'.",1182234973
29132,comment,28990,29018,0,0,davidw,,,"Yeah, I feel bad about posting big long links like that, and would gladly spend the time to use markdown.  I added that as a feature request a while ago (ok, 5 days, but it feels like a 'while ago' in speedy life land):<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27783"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27783</a><p>The 'SEO links' links do, unfortunately, seem to be effective.<p>It seems that the comment is old enough that I can't edit it any more to replace, it, either...sorry.",1182234824

29130,comment,29108,29108,0,0,maliciouskitty,,,"Well, 12-14 hours a day is pretty much the norm for a startup right? <p>I am, too, living thru prelaunch of my startup. But think of looking back at yourself 10 years later... you will be proud that you live through this. If you have the passion, this is the time to be.\n",1182234541

Keep in mind she may take on about as much of the risks and downside as you do without the personal satisfaction you get out of it.<p>Colin Powell may not be President of the US right now simply because his wife is not up for it it.  But even though he could push her into battle or steamroll her, he doesn't.  Just shows that he's a smart guy and model husband -- two traits not often combined in presidents, as it so happens.",1182233344

I can read faster than people can talk and I can't think or work effectively when someone is talking.  Written communication is by far my favorite way of getting information.",1182232931

There's a much bigger pool of jobs from people you don't know and a much better chance of a good match being made somewhere in that pool. The numbers are obviously in your favor despite the fact that people you've worked with know you're good. Its unlikely that you and people you know just happen to want to do the exact same thing at the exact same time with everyone else looking to recruit you.<p>I'd also feel really weird getting a job via acquaintance. Its like a kind of nepotism I don't want or need.",1310003950

Your problem-game turned out to be algorithmically simple. This probably makes it more appealing as a game. But most things in life will not be as simple, and this includes large coding projects.<p>What you call the repair step I see as running the greedy algorithm again, from a different node in the search graph.",1310003884
2736827,comment,2732527,2733485,1,0,gnosis,,,"<i>""Well name a philosophy book that is worth reading.""</i><p>Asking what philosophy book to read is sort of like asking which math book to read.<p>The answer really depends on what you already know.  You're probably not going to recommend that someone completely unfamiliar with math read a calculus textbook, much less an advanced math monogram.<p>Likewise, it's probably not a good idea to recommend that someone unfamiliar with philosophy read Heidegger.  You're probably going to get some very basic recommendations.<p>Even then, you probably won't get much out of reading them without taking a class on the subject in which someone with vastly more experience and understanding than you can guide you and your peers to gain a greater appreciation of what you read, and to stimulate critical thought and discussion about the books you are reading.  That's really the ideal setting for getting introduced to philosophy: as part of a class led by a talented teacher, and with some intelligent peers open to talking about the issues.<p>That said, you should not allow yourself to be misled in to thinking the toe that you dip in to the ocean of philosophy is going to be in any way representative, much less the ""best"" that philosophy has to offer.<p>Even were you to read a ""great"" book when you just start out, you're probably not going to understand much of it or get much out of it on your first go.  Even professional philosophers go back again and again to classics, as they get more out of them each time, with the benefit of greater understanding, and being able to apply the insight and methods they've gained in the meantime to the books they've already read.<p>What I'm trying to say is that reading philosophy in a way that does justice to the topic is a lifetime endeavor.  A one-time bite at any philosophy book just isn't going to give you even an inkling of an idea of what it's about.<p>Still, for an introduction to Western philosophy, you probably won't be able to do better than starting with the Socratic Dialogues.  They are the source and the foundation of much of Western philosophy that's come afterwards, and you really can't properly understand most of the rest without reading this source.<p>I would strongly encourage you to read them as part of an Ancient Philosophy class at a university, for the reasons mentioned a few paragraphs earlier.  Unfortunately, the philosophy departments of universities in the English speaking world tend to be dominated by the Analytic school of philosophy.  So what you'll get from class will probably be biased in that direction.  Just keep in mind that there are other ways of approaching and understanding the issues you read about than the ones you are exposed to in class.",1310003844

TA-ships aren't guaranteed though, and at my school if you stay too long on a TA they take you off of it to make sure that other students have a chance at funding too. My advisor did ultimately get some grant money in, but by that point there were other students who needed it more than me.<p>It might have something to do with recent state budget cuts (it's a state-funded university).

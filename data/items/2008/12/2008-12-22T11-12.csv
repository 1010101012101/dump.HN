406295,comment,405557,406266,0,0,kragen,,,"No.<p>CUDA yes.  Cg yes.  HLSL yes.  Verilog yes.  VHDL yes.  C++ or Java with MapReduce yes.  PHP and MySQL with memcached yes.  Erlang yes — and it really <i>is</i> functional, inside each process, anyway — that is, the level where you <i>aren't getting any parallelism</i>.  Octave or R, potentially, but not today, as far as I know.  Mathematica yes, and it, too, is mostly functional.<p>In theory, side effects are what make parallelism hard, and so languages whose semantics are side-effect-free (unlike F# or Mathematica or Erlang) should make it easy.  So we all thought in 1980.  Since then we spent 20 years or so trying to make that happen, and it basically didn't work.<p>There are basically four kinds of parallelism within easy reach today.  There's SIMD, like MMX, SSE, 3DNow, AltiVec, and the like; you'd think that data-parallel languages and libraries like Numpy and Octave would be all over this, but except for Mathematica, that doesn't seem to be happening.  There's running imperative code on a bunch of tiny independent processors that share no data; AFAIK that's what the shader languages are doing.  There's instruction-level parallelism on a superscalar processor, which largely benefits from things like contiguous arrays in memory, or maybe what Sun is doing with Niagara, where the processor pretends to be a bunch of tiny independent slow processors.  And then there's splitting up your data across a shared-nothing cluster, which is how every high-traffic web site works, and that's what MapReduce makes simpler.<p>Uh, and then there's designing your own hardware or programming FPGAs, which is what Verilog and VHDL are for.<p>Languages like OCaml (I don't know anything about F# except that it's like OCaml, but for the CLR) have no special advantage for any of these scenarios.  They don't even have the <i>theoretical</i> advantage that they have no side effects and therefore you can speculatively multithread them without breaking the language semantics.  They do have the massive practical disadvantage, in most of the scenarios I described, of needing unpredictable amounts of memory, having massive libraries, and using pointers all over the place.  Using pointers all over the place kills your locality of reference and your ILP.  Having massive libraries and using unpredictable amounts of memory makes it impossible to run them inside your GPU and means they can't run on an FPGA (except by using external memory, like the awesome Reduceron).  And nothing about the language semantics helps with SIMD either.<p>So, sheesh, go read Alan Bawden's dissertation or whatever, but don't go around claiming that ML (or even Haskell) is going to magically make your algorithms parallel.  We tried that.  It didn't work.  We're trying something else now.",1229946535

406293,story,,,19,19,Raphael,"The transformation of Reddit",,"I've noticed a shift on Reddit in the last week or two. It's had a sense of camaraderie for many months due to the growing catalog of native memes, but lately it's become literally a lovefest. There are now several personals sections, and the snowstorms have temporarily increased posting volume. Also, the end of the year is a slow time for news, so it gives way to chatter.<p>And the amazing thing is the level of interaction seen. A traditional dating site has you set up a profile and browse others', which is inefficient compared to reading coherent banter until your interest is piqued and you jump into the conversation. It all takes advantage of the dynamic sorting based on voting. The less witty or sensical a comment, the further down it sinks into obscurity.<p>Reddit may have truly found its calling. Whereas HN is (I assume) mainly dudes interested in programming and web apps, some older and in stable relationships, Reddit brims with eager singles ready to hook up.<p>I know kn0thing reads here, and my suggestion to you would be to spend a week or two trying to make this into a real feature. Have a checkbox for ""single"", have a form for basic demographics (sex, age, location, orientation), and structure the site so even more people can hook up. I'm not sure how keen the folks at Conde Nast, a news organization, would be, but you don't get many opportunities like this. Otherwise, some clever hacker is going to jump in and use the Reddit user base to his own advantage.",1229946248

Ok, you're crazy.<p>The problem is, learning Perl allowed you to essentially get a fish for a day.  Perl is not going to last.  What you learned was essentially how to get a Rube Goldberg contraption to do what you wanted.<p>The symbolism in Huck Finn, however, is eternal.  You can then read any great book, or look at any work of art, and understand it at a better level.  What you've done is learned how to fish for yourself.",1229946115

At the end it seemed to me like a journey into a sick mind, which makes it all the more interesting.<p>I would recommend semi-autobiographic books by sick minds.<p>Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, by Robert Pirsig who was actually treated by electrotherapy in a psychiatric ward. He ended up writing a not so sick book with a philosophy I find a lot more convincing than Ayn Rand's.<p>Valis, the novel in which Philipp K. Dick describes how he more or less fails to make sense of his religious (or whatever) experience. It's sold as science fiction, but that's just a weak way of saying that book is completely crazy. Since it is semi-autobiographic, the characters are much more alive than in anything else I read from Philipp K. Dick.<p>And if you want to know why Howard Roark has a low life expectancy:<p>Loneliness, human nature and the need for social connection, by John T Cacioppo and William Patrick.

406280,comment,406226,406226,0,0,xg,,,"It depends, but the answer is probably not. Most people operate shortcodes through an aggregator (OpenMarket, mBlox, Ericson IPX) that has direct binds to all the telecom carriers in a given country.<p>For the most part, aggregators charge a monthly fee usually tied somewhat to system throughput. For example, OpenMarket charges $1500/mo for 10 messages per second outgoing and $20,000/mo for 100 messages per second.<p>On top of that, they charge for messaging. Rack rate in the US is often $.035 outgoing and $.005 incoming. At Twitter's scale, they're probably paying a fraction of a penny per outgoing message and have most incoming fees waived. Some of that is carrier specific however. T-Mobile often doesn't waive the incoming message fees.",1229945217

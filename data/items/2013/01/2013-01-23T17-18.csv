They do this by having a copyright ""airlock"" interface between the executable and the game data (WAD/PAK/PK3/whatever files).  The lesson to learn from this conflict is that if you run an open-source project that encourages creative or artistic content add-ons that may remain proprietary, it's a good idea to establish a rigid copyright airlock between the free stuff and the creative stuff.",1358963993

It sounds (to me) as if you're trying to justify the ubiquitous position of entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs that 'I need to spend a lot of time planning and building before I launch'. I get it...it's scary as hell to launch something that is half-baked and may not feel like your proudest moment.<p>Some constructive criticism - I, nor you, can comment on your user experience, because you and I are NOT the user. I'd love to hear more about ""Sheri Foxton, who can't get enough of the app"" (made-up name and story). Comments like <i>""Our beta product looks and acts amazing""</i> and <i>""two of the most talented UX/Marketing guys in the city""</i> make lean advocates like myself cringe. Lean is about getting close to your customer, and at no point do you ever talk about how you're actually hitting the streets. Your Appstori video is cool, and is exactly what ""lean"" is about - asking potential customers if this is something they want/need. However, there are two things that I just couldn't get past: (1) Your video talked about YOU (Find Your Lobster company) way more than it did ME (the person who wants to find a date). (2) I'm not sure if your UX buddies explained the psychology of user experience (the UI looks great btw!) but basically UX solves one problem - user frustration. If you have no frustration to begin with, than UX means nothing. MVP's are all about creating an app (which will inevitably include some frustration) and then adding features and interfaces which reduce that frustration.<p>Anyway, good luck!",1358963901

It looks like people who reject/don't use facebook due to privacy concerns do so because they don't understand the implications of what they put there. Personally, if I were to be concerned about privacy, I'd just make some research to understand what is and isn't public and how to use the product overall, but I suppose one could be pissed off at facebook for not being clearer about who can or could see what you put in there (even though they constantly try to improve this). Either way, the argument ""I don't use facebook because I'm concerned about the data they extract from me"" is flawed and irrational, because facebook won't know anything you don't explicitly tell to it.

I think it's flawed.<p>I joined FB back when it was <i>closed</i>. In my mind I wasn't putting anything 'out there' for the world.  The first time they made things public and started messing with the <i>default privacy settings</i> I was worried but gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Then the cycle repeated  with new features and settings, which were altered from their previous states.  From that point on I realised they didn't actually care about privacy the way I understand the term and they've gone on to 'open-up' more and more (rather aggressively in my view). What used to be hidden (or at least you <i>thought</i> it was) essentially becomes public at some point in the future.<p>Had I known this was the direction FB was taking I would have treated it as a <i>public site from the very beginning</i>.  Twitter on the other hand <i>was</i> public <i>from the beginning</i>, so my interactions there have been different.  I think it's unreasonable to expect that Joe Bloggs out there can get his head around what's public/private on FB.  Even if they do there's no telling what might change in the future.<p>Of course, I could leave FB but then I'd lose touch with people.  So now I leave my profile alone, hardly ever 'like' anything and generally try and limit what I do there. I'm sure FB still gleans plenty of info about me from whatever my friends do (i.e tagging photos, connecting address books etc).",1358963721

5104209,comment,5103054,5103344,1,0,dccoolgai,,,"Since this question seems to come up all the time, I have crafted a stock answer in the idiom of some books I really enjoyed in my youth:<p>Choose Your Own Adventure:  Should I get a CS Degree?
<i>Do you want to be a great developer?</i>  Yes! (Page 3) | Not Really. (Page 2)<p>(Page 2)
 Thats totally cool, actually.  If you were going to force me to wager on who becomes a success or changes the world more, I would put my money on an okay developer with a strong business sense, basic understanding of Minimalist/Gestalt design principles, or thorough understanding of a problem domain where technology has not been fully brought to bear over a purebred great developer any day.  The great thing about choosing this route is that you can always decide later that you want to go deeper down the rabbit hole and learn more if and when you need to.  My one nugget of sage advice if you choose this path is this;  Be very, very cautious of not investing too much effort in solving big problems without first trying to do some research about who has tackled a similar problem before and in what way.  You probably have some friends who went and got CS degrees;  Buy them lunch (much cheaper than getting a CS degree), explain what youre working through and ask them if it sounds similar to any data structures or patterns that they know of.  An ounce of humility and patience here can literally save your product/career.  You win!  THE END!<p>(Page 3)
OK Then: Here is something you need to hear.  Despite what all the look at me, Im a successful developer and I have no CS degree reinforcement responses that inevitably pop up on these threads might lead you to believe, you <i>cannot skip doing the work</i> of understanding the fundamental and counter-intuitive principles and patterns that (most good) CS curricula impart and be a great developer.  Doesnt happen.  Sorry.<p>However, despite what all the You _need_ a CS degree  I got one and I know you could never be a good developer without one responses (that also inevitably pop up on these threads) might lead you to believe, a CS degree is not the _only_ way to learn these things.  It is _a_ wayand you might even say a pretty darn good and efficient waybut you can do it on your own if you are motivated enough.<p>That leaves us with the question below: 
<i>How do you want to do the work?</i>  On My Own! (Page 4) | At A University! (Page 5)<p>(Page 4)
Cool.  I guess Id recommend googling Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis as starting-off pointsif you wanted to read (and understand even half of) Knuths books, you could most likely put any CS Bachelor to shame.  Have at it.  GO TO PAGE 6!<p>(Page 5) 
Cool.  The one obvious advantage of this path is that they give you a little totem at the end that says you did the work.  That little totem may be worth more or less depending on who is looking at it and their general worldview  but no one can ever take it away or deny that you have it.  The other obvious advantage is that it puts you in the general vicinity of other people who were willing to do the work.  Maybe you meet some of them and end up doing some things together?  I dont know.  The obvious disadvantage is that doing this costs money.  Dont do too many drugs, join a couple clubs (but not a frat/sorority) and savor the concept that for 4(-ish?) years, your entire environment is focused on your personal intellectual enrichment  this will <i>never, ever</i> happen to you again in your whole life.  Dont be too smug when you finish, thoughyou have about 5-7 more years of hard work ahead of you before you are worth a real damn to anyone but your mother (but at least they will pay you)so dont break your arm patting yourself on the back.  If youre lucky enough to graduate during one of the bubbles, you can get hired quickly at a good rate..but save your money, because bubbles dont last forever.  If you graduate during an offshoring trough take a job in a niche industry or do tech support for a while, but dont panic  the next bubble will be coming in 2-3 yearsthe system just has to flush out all the Look at me! Im a growth-hacker/new-media-guru dead weight they hired during the last bubble.  Learn at least one new technical thing on your own every year (just make sure its a real thing you can use to solve problems and not some doucheword like agile) but spend more time with your friends (in real places, not some MMOG).  Always be the person who buys the first round of shots/beers when you meet new people  you will either get one back in return and a new friend, or you will learn quickly who is not worth keeping aroundeither way, you win.   THE END!<p>(Page 6)
If I am going to hire you, you better believe I will ask you <i>what you did instead of getting that degree</i> to learn the stuff you need to learn so that you arent spending my teams time and money trying to solve problems that were solved 30 years ago in a much better way than you ever could...(No, child, you are not more clever than Dijkstra)and if you think that me daring to ask you that is sufficient cause for you to terminate the interview process, then you have done my work for me.  On the other hand, dont let me give you a haircut, either  and I will try to;  I put CS Degree Required on my job postings because I dont want every bubble-jumper who spent an hour watching a Coursera video wasting my time.  I <i>want</i> you to give me your resume, but I also <i>want</i> you to stop and think for a second about whether or not youve really done the equivalent work to mature as a developer.  You are different from the school of fish who just arent finishers  but you are swimming in the same pond, so make sure I know the difference between you and themand if I cant tell, then I really do suck and you just saved yourself 6-7 months of working for a place where you dont want to be anyhow and you win.

5104181,comment,5102000,5102000,6,0,parasubvert,,," I don't find this email exchange appalling at all.  What's appalling is the naive idealistic reaction here, that reeks of blindness to how business is practiced at scale.<p>I've been involved in this sort of anti-poaching discussion at senior levels before.  It happens all the time, in many industries - particularly in jurisdictions  non-competes are enforceable.  When an executive leaves one place and goes to another (say a CIO or VP), they bring people with them. Often in violation of non-solicitation and non-compete agreements, which are a pain in the ass for everyone to enforce.  So you do what you can to Stop. The. Practice.<p>In the case of California, Jobs didnt have a direct legal avenue to stop this so he wanted to use other threats to stop a competitor.  That seems normal.  If it was not legal, then his lawyers did him no favors.  Immoral?  Not at all.  It's business.<p>The reaction here reminds me of Slashdot circa 98, clucking over leaked Microsoft memos.  The hacker/open source idealism here seems way stronger than that of entrepreneurs or business people. Makes sense I guess.<p>Perhaps people love early stage companies here because they can ignore the dirtier parts of business after you have a product/market fit... like, competition.<p>Competition is dirty and messy.  It's not a kid gloves ""lets out innovate each other!"" like you're toddlers in a sandbox not allowed to hit each other.  It's about marketing negatively (see Samsung's anti Apple ads), aggressive sales and pricing (see the Nexus 7 sold at cost), stopping poaching (Apple above), and removing supply lines by buying them up (Apple with displays and flash memory).<p>Sure, business isn't JUST those things.  It also is innovation.  Preferably lots of it.  But people here are a rather naive if they think most companies aren't spending over 50% of their time on the former.  Apple is actually unique for their size in how much time it spends innovating rather than, to paraphrase Ray Kroc, ""sticking a live hose in your competitor's mouth"".",1358963445

Meaning you can increase your chance of success by having the factors Ruben mentioned above in place. I would also add that these factors make it easier to outsource your app:<p>1. Having dev skills<p>2. Building a mobile app or WP plugin (i.e., something simple) vs. a SaaS app (i.e. tons of moving parts and more ongoing maintenance)<p>3. Experience outsourcing in the past. It is absolutely a learned skill and the more you do it the better you get.<p>If you have none of the things Ruben and I have listed (so you're not a dev, you're building a SaaS or other complex app, it's your first time outsourcing, etc...) you have a very, very low chance of succeeding. And if you have every single one you're on the opposite end - IMO the swing could literally be from 10% chance to 90% chance of success depending on the factors you have in place.",1358963359

I.e., you want to be able to have a total focus when your mind is fresh.  That is not going to be doable after you've already worked your 8-9 day (maybe if you're in the 1% of humans who can do that, but I'm talking about the common case).   This is going to get worse in the case of having a family.<p>I'm not going to comment on your father, since I don't know him, don't know his research, and don't know his field. :-) But I know that I've been... less impressed... with part-time PhD research than with full-time PhD research. There are ways to manipulate your situation into a less conflicting one, that is true, but that depends on the employer and the university.<p>> pushed the current boundaries of human knowledge further away from anything applicable, interesting, or worth spending 6 years of your life on.<p>That's just your opinion, ne? Why should academics do anything that is applicable? Isn't it industry's role to take this research and channel it into something practical (or ignore it if its not)? A surprising amount of effort has been expended over the years in software that have been avoided by some basic attention to the research literature.<p>But that leads us down an entirely different discussion, one I don't think is really resolvable here and now.",1358962503

At this level, you're only going to be attracting mid-level talent.  There could a problem with your recruitment targeting, which could mean you're not getting ideal people in the door to begin with.<p>At the mid-level, you should expect a high failure rate on simple tasks.  You're dealing with people who wound up on the job market after getting a bunch of experience.  This means that a lot of them were fired, came from untenable/poorly managed companies which went under/downsized, or were working under such unbearable conditions that they quit.  Employed devs trade up - unless your pay packet, benefits or feel-good factor (eg if you're an NGO, charity, working on 'real' problems, etc) give your company an edge, you're not dragging people away from jobs where they're encouraged to develop their skills, work under good conditions and understand software engineering processes.  Job postings regularly ask for ridiculous and irrelevent things, so a lot of the employed devs who read your job ad and apply will not meet the criteria you specify.  I know it's a huge generalisation, but the best devs are usually only on the market a couple of times in their lives, and they're quickly snapped up by companies at a premium and kept happy with various incentives.  Tl;dr: you should be prepared for most candidates that you interview to not be appropriate for the job you've posted.<p>Thirdly, there's a problem with your, ahem, problem.  It's not a great problem, imo because there's a fair amount of nuance to it.  I'd want to shine by giving a good solution - vaguely remembering that a value in Pascal's triangle can be derived from combinations or permutations or something similar I'd spend some time trying to figure out if there's some algorithm ""n!/(n+k)! - no, that's not it..."", then I'd try to do it in-place calculating only half of the triangle, and then probably wind up using two rows of half length to calculate the numbers there.  I'd be trying to impress you by coming up with a solution with more useful properties (memory boundedness, complexity, speed) than ""returns the row of pascal's triangle"".  You're probably not even hiring people for their comp sci experience.<p>Maybe you just wanted to vent, or to advertise here - that's ok, but keep in mind that you're going to have to quickly reject unsuitable candidates and quickly pick up suitable ones, that it's just a numbers game, and that this is why most companies that offer mid-range compensation are ""always hiring"".  The problem isn't <i>too hard</i> as such, it's perhaps a little undirected.  Also, some people just interview terribly.<p>Dunno, just some food for thought.",1358962486

I think that they're wrong, not necessarily because you'll have a hard time finding a job, but because you'll be missing out on a great life experience that will enrich your life and should give you some better tools for analyzing problems. These tools will come not only from CS classes, but also from humanities courses, and interactions with other students.<p>That said, I wouldn't recommend leaving your job to go to school full time either. Why not take night classes and get that degree over time? I think that, at least right now, in classroom is a superior experience to online, so I would probably go for some place that you can actually sit in a classroom. Even if it's just at a community college to start. I got my BS in Electrical Engineering, and didn't really like my curriculum. So, after I graduated and moved out to Boston, I found out that Tufts University offered classes that residents could audit cheaply. I took a few programming courses to plug holes left by my degree, and a philosophy course with Dan Dennett (because it was Dan Dennett and I had to).<p>Some of my favorite courses at university were not programming courses. Among my favorite courses were: Free Will, Literature, Nietzsche, Data Structures, Game Development, Differential Equations and Quantum Mechanics. You would miss out on most of those unless you are actively seeking them out.<p>There are also some soft-skills that come along with education, namely, being able to communicate well. This is one of the more important things when it comes to landing a job, at least for making it past the first level of filters. I've seen some awful cover letters and resumes, it helps a lot to be able to write well, and state things clearly.<p>Also, I'm not sure what you think the lifestyle of Silicon Valley is like, but for me, it's just a lot of hard work. Don't get me wrong, I love it here, but it's not particularly glamorous. Perhaps the biggest draw, well two biggest draws, would be that, first, you'll never (assuming we don't have another tech bubble burst on us) have trouble finding a job here, if you're a decent programmer. And second, that you'll regularly run into other programmers everywhere. If you're living some place where people look at you funny when you tell them that you build computer programs for a living, and would rather live in a place where people generally have a clue as to what you're talking about, this is a good place for that. Also, you probably won't have trouble finding a job here.",1358961707

Some techie (RC drones/helicopters), others not so (woodworking). One activity I have enjoyed for nearly twenty years is Schutzhund Obedience training. I have now gone through this process four times (always German Shepherd Dogs). I find it incredibly rewarding and lots of fun. Nothing like spending a couple of hours at a park training your dog to completely unplug you from the keyboard.<p>It's even more fun when you get to teach your kids how to train the dogs. For kids this inspires confidence, inner-strength, self-reliance, compassion, understanding and a whole host of other good qualities that you just can't get out of playing video games all day. A dog is almost a perfect mirror of who you are. They reflect how you treat them and how you relate to them. If you are mean they'll be skittish and afraid. If you are firm but fair they'll be confident and willing to do anything you ask. If you are not disciplined and consistent they'll be confused and will not respect you. Too many lessons in just one activity to list here.<p>If you've never seen Schutzhund, here's a really neat video:<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTZmIFdgU2M<p>I am not affiliated with this dog or this kid at all. I just think this video is a beautiful example of the connection that can be created between a dog an its owner. Keep in mind that in this video she was seven years old. She has full control of a dog that probably weighs nearly twice as much as her and if far stronger.<p>How about you? What does your life look like outside of work?",1358961567

I thought I had gone crazy, or was in the process of going crazy. Back then, the Internet wasn't as helpful as it is today (or harmful, depending upon how you want to look at it), or I would have Googled it; but I had heard about panic attacks through film and TV (The Sopranos, for example) and I eventually dragged myself into a bookstore to browse the self-help section (something the ""before"" me never would have done), and there I stumbled across books about anxiety disorders. After a few months of suffering, this was enough to motivate me to see a doctor. Of course, the doctor was familiar with anxiety, and suggested that I see a psychiatrist. This totally blew my mind. A psychiatrist? I was ""normal"" just a few months before. I had never even considered seeing a psychiatrist for any reason, so I brushed it off, thinking that I just needed to get it under control by myself.<p>So I spent the next year reading about anxiety, going through workbooks, taking supplements (another thing I had never done before), and trying to ""gain control."" Turns out, trying to wrest control is a bad way to approach anxiety; it imposes impossible expectations upon yourself--""If only I were smarter and stronger I wouldn't have these panic attacks. I just need to get it together."" This kind of thinking makes anxiety worse. And it got worse.<p>Eventually though, I was able to find a better approach that involved accepting anxiety as a part of my life. I was inspired by something I had read about Zen Buddhism, so I began trying to view my anxiety as an old friend, my old torturer, my own brand of human suffering. Believe it or not, this worked. I began to intentionally do things that made me anxious. Axiety is much less powerful once you acknowledge that its roots lie in the brain, in the evolutionary drive to protect oneself from danger, and you can't consciously control it. All you can do is acknowledge it and move on, or ""Feel the fear and do it anyway."" I forced myself to reengage in life. I never stayed home when feeling anxious (I found this was the worst possible thing I could do); I accepted invitations to parties, I traveled, I enrolled in college, I moved.<p>But I continued having recurring episodes of severe anxiety that would leave me crippled for weeks: I couldn't sleep, I could barely eat, I had difficulty doing simple things like grocery shopping. So, at the urging of my family, I saw a psychiatrist (who was not helpful at all, as all she wanted to do was find out whether someone had touched my peepee when I was a boy. Hint: no one had), a neurologist (who was very helpful and very knowledgeable about anxiety), and a new primary doctor. My doctors coordinated to find a suitable medication, an SSRI. With this, coupled with my learned coping skills, I eventually began to feel ""normal"" again. A few years later, after experiencing no severe anxiety, I dropped the medication and was able to move on with my life.",1358961106

5103956,story,,,1,0,cdolan92,"Why the startup world needs a ""Vendor API""",,"You see a lot of startups today, most in the tech space or 'business to consumer' markets. Many are creating a new service to disrupt something that is simply disorganized or out of reach to a certain market, like ber, or BlackJets. The power of these businesses is that they handle transactions directly through the consumer on the credit card. Generally, they charge and track just 1 or 2 values, that is, ""what the end user paid"", and ""what they owe the cab driver"", pilot, pedicab driver, or other vendor.<p>For those of you in B2B startups, you may already know this, but for those still in B2C, I'll fill you in:<p>Handling vendor invoices can be a real pain, especially if you are trying to disrupt a truly rusting industry. My vendors still send paper invoices via mail, or, at best, PDF invoices via email.<p>However, vendor pricing data must be accurate in my systems, and the existing services are not perfect for a startup's needs. ACH can be a big risk to your cash flow, and credit cards, as Square is showing, have their inherent drawbacks. Also, OCR just isn't there yet, unless you have a form-style piece of paper, like a personal check.<p>So where does that leave startups like us, who are tracking more than just the 'Total Amount Paid' field, who want to digitize -everything- in their vendor payments for analysis?<p>My company is an information service for company's and their <i>dumpsters</i>. The product/pricing book for dumpsters is anything but simple. <i>Every</i> location has a different sized can, with various fuel surcharges, environmental fees, local government taxes, frequency of pickups, and so on. I want to track all of this, and so far, I've had to employ interns to do the data entry for us. And worst of all? There are millions of permutations of waste invoices. If I went with OCR, I'd really just be trading man-hours entering data for man-hours managing invoice templates.<p>ACH, as I said earlier, is a big risk because its -instant- ... Why do you think credit cards are so much more popular than debit cards? And even if I did ACH, I paid full price, before the full net-pay duration, and <i>still</i> lost out on the data.<p>'What about ERP Systems?!' - well thats an option, but they are massively 'clunky', and barely automate anything anyway - I'd still have to get a direct tap into my vendor's databases/ERP systems... Sounds like $ millions $ to me.<p>So I'm left with this question:<p>Why isn't there a universal API, or something similar, that companies like my own can tap into, and automagically track dozens of fields per invoice record? Get every vendor-type company to push data into the system, and BOOM - we've got an exchange.<p>If anyone wants to create that, you have my seed backing. Alternatively, if my Google skills just aren't as good as someone else's, and there is a better system than exists from what I mentioned above, please, please fill me in. Hoarding knowledge isn't cool, didn't philosophy teach you?!",1358961015

(not yelling, just wish HD had markdown to enhance posts)<p><pre><code>    1- If you are not going to become an entrepreneur
       being a programmer is like being a supermodel
    2- If you are going to work for large companies
       degrees are necessary filters
    3- The academic knowledge filter
    4- If you don't get a shot in fields you don't know
       exist there things you are not going to learn on
       your own
    5- If you can be frugal you might be on the right path
    6- Technology moves very quickly
</code></pre>
Let's look at these one-by-one.<p>PROGRAMMER IS LIKE A SUPERMODEL<p>Depending on what you are doing your career can become far more difficult as you approach an age range between 35 and 50.  There definitely is age discrimination in the tech industry.  This is particularly true of programming.  Companies will never tell you this, but they'd rather hire a 24 year old vs. a 40 year old. Why?  There could be many factors here, from the ability (and desire) of a young person to just-about kill themselves working 24/7 to lower pay.<p>Why might a degree be important here?  If you hit the age wall your only options might then be to become an entrepreneur or move into management.  You don't need a degree for entrepreneurship.  You probably do for management.<p>THE LARGE COMPANY FILTER<p>Large companies, companies who hire lots of people all the time, almost have no choice but to implement first-level filters.  The process doesn't always lend itself to the laborious, time-consuming and personal process you would need to evaluate someone who is self-taught.  If your goal is to work from some of these companies, you'll need a degree or you'll need to get in at a lower level and prove your worth from within.<p>THE FILTER<p>Quick, list sorting algorithms in order of computational efficiency!<p>I know tons of brilliant people --with and without degrees-- who could not answer that and the myriad of other ""are we still in college?"" questions in interviews.  The fact is that some companies use crap like this to filter you.  I call it crap because, to me at least, all is says is that the person might have a good memory and that maybe they spent a week preparing for the interview.  It says virtually nothing about anything else.  I rather sit down with a candidate, present a problem and actually work together on solving it.  Take into account that he or she is probably nervous and just watch how they go about the process.<p>To me flexibility, process and creativity are far more important. In fact, I want to know how someone goes about dealing with a problem they know absolutely nothing about.  For example, I might ask you:  ""Do you program in Python?  No? OK, let's sit down and see how you approach writing a program that generates n numbers in the Fibonacci series in Python."".  Of course, this process takes far more time than simply kicking you out the door if you don't have a degree or can't answer a set of puzzles.  However, it tells me far more about you as a person and as a professional who is very likely to have to deal with things you know nothing about while working for me.<p>EXPOSURE TO UNCOMMON FIELDS<p><pre><code>    Have you worked with state machines?  
    Machine Learning?
    Assembler?
    Threaded Interpretive Languages?
    UML?
    Patterns?
    Implemented a small round-robin or preemptive RTOS?
    Recursion?

    Why not?
</code></pre>
If you are doing run-of-the-mill web development these and other subjects can probably be classified between ""never applicable"" to ""uncommon"".  Can you learn ML on your own?  Sure.  Most people don't.  Too many other shiny things to focus on.  For example, that new language or framework you are seeing posts about with more frequency on HN.  The problem is that such subjects do have relevance and applicability in areas one might not always recognize.  College will expose you to a wide array of subjects and theory that, even if studied superficially, might become a part of how you think when faced with new challenges or difficult problems.  There's value in that.  Again, you can learn these things on your own but you kind of have to know they are there as an option in order to reach for them.<p>That said, some of what you are going to learn in college today will be utterly useless in twenty or thirty years.  Example?  In the 80's they still taught FORTRAN.  OK, maybe not useless today from an academic standpoint but useless in terms of relevance to the vast majority of CS work today.<p>FRUGALITY IS ALWAYS THE KEY<p>You are 19 and live in the UK.  Can you save 30K per year (or more) if you really and honestly cut out everything you don't need in life?  Do this for ten years.  Save your money.  Invest some of it in low-risk investments (see a professional).  Don't get greedy.  If you don't screw it up, in ten years you'll have 300K in the bank.  That is life-changing money at 29 years of age.  Use the ten years to also learn a LOT about money and finances.  Don't blow it on stupid shit.  If you get to that point you'll be able to decided where YOU want to go and what you want to do.  Maybe you take a few years off and jump right into college to get a degree based on what you now understand is your primary interest.  You will have options.  And no debt.<p>OLD TECH<p>I alluded to this earlier.  Someone who went to school in the 80's was not exposed to any of the myriad of technologies, languages and frameworks that exist today.  To some extent, nearly everyone in CS becomes self-taught after a while.  You have to.  Things move too quickly.  Today you can choose from a pile of languages and platforms to work on.  Twenty years ago that was not necessarily the case.  It can be confusing and exciting at the same time.  College will teach you a number of things that are applicable to today and could be nearly useless in ten or twenty years.  I don't know, to pull an example out of my hat, you could go to Stanford and study Objective-C and iOS programming.  Today this could be a valuable skill if you want to work at Apple or start your own business writing iOS apps.  In ten or twenty years?  Who knows.  What we do know is that it is far likely that you will have to learn new things that aren't even in the horizon today.  Most of the theory, discipline and workflows you are going to learn in college today will still be applicable and valuable in twenty years.  That's probably where a lot of the value is.<p>CONCLUSION<p>Anyhow, one could go on and do a dance where you jump between both sides of the argument, for and against college.  There is no easy answer because nobody knows if the next Facebook or Google is someone inside your 19-year-old brain.  What if it isn't?  They you are like the vast majority of professionals in this field who will need to work until they retire.  Consider that for a moment.  This isn't meant to be a downer but rather a trigger for you to think about the various options and permutations life can throw at you.  Yes, you could come up with a brilliant idea on Monday, execute on it brilliantly and never look back.  Or not.  I feel that, to some extent, a degree could be more useful later in life as you might have a need to transition into management.  At some level people are simply not going to even consider you for, say, a VP or CTO position without a degree.  A degree also opens the path to, perhaps, going for an MBA and shifting your career in another direction as you get older.  Again, think supermodel.  You are hot today and everyone might want to hire you.  What will happen in twenty years?  In many ways what choices you make today are really a preparation for the latter part of your life, when options will be reduced.<p>This, in general, has nothing to do with the question of a degree.  Lots of youngsters go get a degree and fail to recognize what life might have in store for them when they get older.  They blow money and time right and left.  I was one of those youngsters.  I bought my first house when I was 21 years old.  Paid cash.  I owned two race cars, a sailboat and every new piece-of-shit electronic gadget that came out.  I was making a lot of money in tech and blowing through it like it was free.  I wish someone had kicked me in the head and schooled me about what real-life looked like after the party.  Eventually the party was over and I lost everything.  Lucky for me, I have entrepreneurship in my DNA.  It wasn't long before I launched my own business and bootstrapped myself from nothing --and I do mean ""nothing"" as in not a penny to my name-- to being a successful business owner.  I did waste about ten years of my life.  I am proof that a degree isn't an antidote for youthful stupidity.  In the end my massive ""phase 1"" failure taught a lot.  Maybe it was good that it happened that way.  I don't know.<p>Choose wisely.",1358960729

(Yes parks, but in many places that's only feasible for half the year.)<p>Libraries are one of the last places where you can just sit and work or study or read in a public space, and whenever I go to my local ones the tables are always filled with people of all ages doing just that.",1358960682

6454151,comment,6450747,6451068,1,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"As others have said, there probably isn&#x27;t a tangible business justification to go back and fix a problem that isn&#x27;t materially impacting a large percentage of customers.  A lot of managers follow the Pareto (80-20) rule, which just means fix the top 20% of bugs, and 80% of your problems go away.<p>The cost of actually fixing a bug is proportional to the amount of time which has elapsed since the code was written.  The cheapest time to fix a bug, of course, is right when a programmer is initially writing something, and it only gets more expensive as time goes by.  This is why writing unit tests is so important;  if you can catch bugs up front you&#x27;ll end up saving a lot of pain and agony of trying to go back and figure out what went wrong.<p>Another important factor is there are a lot of politics in big companies.  If there isn&#x27;t an advocate (usually an engineer) who demands that a bug gets fixed, the bug probably isn&#x27;t going to be fixed.  The problem with advocating for something though means that you need to spend some political capital.  When it comes to bugs, unfortunately there isn&#x27;t a lot of positive political capital that you&#x27;ll recapture as a result of fixing it.  Managers aren&#x27;t going to get praised for the lack of bugs in a particular piece of software, <i>unless the software was buggy to begin with, someone complained loudly about it, and they went in and cleaned it up</i>.  If that happens and they were responsible for the bugs to begin with, they&#x27;re probably not going to want to highlight the fact that it was their fault.",1380236346

6454136,comment,6452960,6452960,1,0,Ycros,,,"We&#x27;re using AngularJS for the second time on a project, and it&#x27;s great. While I found the basics easy to pick up, some of my team struggled a bit more (but they&#x27;ve also spent less time doing heavy client-side JS development).<p>The biggest problem AngularJS has is documentation. Some of it is missing, some of it is poorly explained, all of it should have examples. The developer guide and API reference both need a rework/rewrite. I think the team should focus on this after this major 1.2 release.<p>What comes out of poor documentation is that best practices are not immediately obvious, because if you&#x27;re trying to guess things from just the API and just picking a random way to achieve your end result, chances are you&#x27;re going to do it wrong. This has been identified at <a href=""https://github.com/angular-ui/community/issues/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular-ui/community/issues/1</a> so hopefully it&#x27;s going to get better.<p>The major thing which I think almost everyone gets wrong at first are the relationships between templates, scopes, controllers, services and your actual data. If you get this wrong you&#x27;ll either end up writing a bunch of tricky workaround code, having memory leaks or subtle data binding bugs.<p>I highly recommend everyone watches the best practices video from the AngularJS team at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY</a>",1380236257

I was born in a developing country and the details of my condition at birth are nebulous, partly out of the ignorance of my guardians, understandably. Anyway, I&#x27;m pretty sure the surgery was done to ameliorate some amblyopia, because in North America, the ophthalmologist said wearing eyeglasses were useless that whole time (I&#x27;d been wearing them since an infant, basically). After that I had another surgery as a child and again as a teen.<p>Anyway, I also have what I like to describe as an underdeveloped stereoscopic vision. I can&#x27;t see 3D movies either. Basically, my condition fits the OP&#x27;s description.<p>When I tried out the Nintendo 3DS I also could not see it well, but I moved it at angles and kind of, barely could.

If I were as childish as you, I would respond that you believe in &quot;Socialism and the Drug war!&quot; (both proven failures)<p>I am only replying for the sake of people who may not have been introduced to Libertarianism.<p>Libertarianism is absolutely reliant on property rights and contract rights. Both of which must be enforced by a government and were violated in the example above. The huge penalties would be levied by a court.<p>The regulation that most Libertarians oppose is more akin to the current situation. There are vast regulations on Wall Street (and resources expended putting them in place) but when rampant fraud becomes evident not a single prosecution is made. In the meantime, the barrier to entry is raised and competition is stifled with further meaningless regulation as the Government sells it self to special interests (while claiming &quot;reform&quot;). Other examples: illegal wars, illegal torture, illegal surveillance. No one held accountable.<p>Your post amounts to &quot;you&#x27;re against meaningless/hurtful regulation? anarchy doesnt work!!!&quot;",1380234545

So about 25x wholesale/suburban prices. For the price, you get really easy web interface and almost no hassle pickup/delivery. If I lived in a city and had no storage, I would consider it but I don&#x27;t know how much one can pack in just 3cu ft boxes.<p>I hope they offer larger boxes or rather, standard pallets. After all, the boxes will be storage in typical bins in a warehouse. Industrial warehouses rent out indoor pallet-sized bins (4ft x 4ft x 5ft = 80cu ft.) for about $12/mo. If they charge a customer $25/mo for 12cu ft and stack even 5 customers in one pallet (60 cu ft), they make $25*5 - $12 = $113 => 90%+ gross margin. This is just monthly storage. Of course the warehouse charges handling fees but they would certainly offer price breaks when 1000+ bins are rented out.<p>This can be a very profitable venture if the marketing and customer service is done right and their small apartment dwelling customers wouldn&#x27;t have to rent a car or ask friends for a ride just to storage the christmas decorations each year.

Maintain a steady income with minimal time investment and leave enough time on the side to work on your Startup. The key of course is having enough time on the side to be effective with the Startup. For many people, this is why they prefer Freelance/Consulting. Much easier to schedule and make your own schedule. I found Freelancing/Consulting to be too inconsistent for me personally, so I found an &#x27;Industry Job&#x27; that only takes up 3-4 days a Week (alternating). This provides steady income, and leaves me 3-4 days a week to work on my Startup. Once the Startup shows enough traction to generate funding, then I will move to the Startup full time.<p>On my first Startup I made the mistake of going full time with no steady income. In hindsight, I should have maintained a lower steady income instead of having no steady income. With no income, I effectively put a limitation on my ability to work the Startup full time. Unless the Startup gains traction, you eventually run out of money and end up back at square one (or square zero depending on the situation).<p>Some people may be in really good positions that afford them the opportunity to work on their Startup full time and not have to worry about income. That&#x27;s great for them, but for everyone else, it&#x27;s 90 hour work weeks.",1380234422

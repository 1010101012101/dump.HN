Hindsight is 20/20 but what I learnt from your story is that it's important to ask investors the minimum valuation and cash/equity split they will accept before engaging a potential buyer. In general, knowing your own limits is important going into any negotiation.<p>Before quitting and losing control over so many years of hard work, I would recommend putting your recent frustration with the VC aside and sitting down with him to understand what he wants from any future liquidity events. You say he has been a good investor so far, and may be he is under pressure from LPs or has something that would explain his strange behavior.<p>I can imagine it would be hard to work on a startup where your final outcome seemingly depends on a person who seems to be fickle and unreliable. Any clarity you can get on this may help align your interests with them.<p>Reminds me of something a very wise venture capitalist once told me in a cynical moment: ""At exit, everyones' interests are misaligned"". The only thing you can do to avoid this is try to 'hire' VCs who are also good people.<p>Sorry it has come to this. Hope it works out for you.",1298937589

You don't consider the leadership to have a blind spot that might be remedied, you consider them ""shockingly incompetent"". Unlike clumsily managed larger enterprises, they don't pay well, don't sound like they have any defensible advantages and are painted as being on the verge of shutdown. You're crediting the <i>niche</i> rather than the product itself for being able to generate revenue despite a lack of effort directed at winning and retaining clients.<p>If a job's sole saving grace is solving interesting problems and you've been the driving force behind finding a solution, surely there are better options open?",1298937424

In essence, the author proposes that Groupon readers design 'deal templates' and businesses fulfill them. This way, Groupon is creating true customers, not deal chasers.<p>The idea of 'demand-driven' Groupon is an instance of a larger trend: demand-driven marketplaces. Before the Web almost all markets were supply-driven. Suppliers bring the products and customers can only choose from the list. With technologies like Google AdWords and Alibaba, customers get more power and pull the right products/content from producers. Idea of demand-driven marketplace can be applied to any market.<p>The real question is how much share demand-driven approach can get? Many customers still prefer the supply-centric world.",1298937100

A return to Stupidland: Ten years after the dotcom boom (independent.co.uk)<p>It's a nice personal account of appreciating lessons from the past.  I believe PG has written that there is no bubble.  I have to agree on that statement.<p>The dotcom bubble had totally different characteristics from today's upward shift.  One can easily understand this difference from the IPOs of 1999.  This was the target back then.  Build it, grow it, sell it to the ignorants without any profit in the foreseeable future.  Yes I know there were exceptions like Amazon that made it a few years down the line. However most of the entrepreneurs back then and their investors knew that their product/service will have no chance to make it in reality and all they wanted was the easy way out.<p>So what's the difference now?<p>Currently evaluations run high.  Buyouts, not IPOs.  If you don't like “Google” buying XYZ startup, just don't buy ""Google"" or sell it.  However “Google” has a real sense of what they want to achieve and if they miss on a buyout, then they are the first to hit the ground.  Hit the ground it is for some biggies, but we are not going to do name-dropping here. Their boards should have known better on who they put as CEO.<p>So are we seeing a bubble now?<p>Not by 10 million miles.  And the reason is simple.  Most of 1999 bubbles were copycats of the kind: Our Super Duper Site is going to be the NEW e-commerce market bla-bla that nobody thought and everyone needs.  Give us 1 billion through IPO and we'll make it.<p>To begin with, the vast majority of Web 2.0 startups, are growing with “peanut” funding compared to 1999. However those that grow deliver good returns for their investors that are professionals (Angel Investors and VCs).  So if someone takes a wrong call to invest in a startup, it won't be a pensioner hoping to turn 50$ into vacation in the Caribbean, but rather a professional who took a wrong bet.  After all they know the odds and they have agreed to play the game. No tears.<p>Now not to underestimate the importance of Web 1.0, but Web 2.0 is the real revolution of IT in the cloud.  One IT revolution was with the PC in the 1980s and the second one is Web 2.0. What are the reasons?  In my opinion 2 main reasons:<p>1) Bigger bandwidth with popular DSL connections that can handle fairly demanding applications.
2) The explosion of publicly available open software tools from OS, to databases, to frameworks, to everything.<p>So when are we going to see another bubble?<p>I asked Nostradamus and he said in 6 years.",1298936217

The past three months has been some of the worst in my life but also provided some of the most valuable lessons learned. I thought I would use a throwaway account to blow of some steam and hopefully get some valuable feedback.<p>This is the situation: My startup is profitable with a team of 10 or so people and with a very happy and loyal customer base. But after five years in business I have come to accept that it has failed to yield any really high growth. This has forced us to take a step back and look at how we can reframe our business. We need to find a new product/market fit to kick in the next gear and get back on track to higher growth.<p>Three months ago, a favorable acquisition offer comes along. Part cash part equity, favorable terms. Because of our dwindling growth it is lousy timing valuation-wise. But right in this situation an acquisition might not be so bad because we know that we have a couple of years of very hard work ahead of us if we are going to turn the company around. Our VC has been supportive and great all along the way, although a huge red flag is that he has declined to be part of any new round of financing if that would happen. Discussing the offer with him, we agreed to go for a very rapid negotiation process and see the results.<p>But now when money is on the table, the VC turns very aggressively on us demanding much more of the deal value than stipulated by his share in the company. During the process he behaves very strangely, travels overseas and does not answer emails or calls for days and weeks on end which drags the negotiations out into months. The shareholder agreement allows him to block the deal if he's not happy with the terms, but so can us founders so the negotiations turn into a battle of wills.<p>In the teleconferences we do manage to set up, our VC uses whatever means he can to lean hard on us, including very verbal attacks on us personally. Sometimes he turns awkwardly friendly, doling out legal advice that on fact-checking turns out to be erroneous bordering on dangerous.<p>What happened in the end was that the acquisition offer was rescinded. The reasons cited for the offer to be withdrawn was that the timing was no longer there and that the buyer would not be happy to have our VC as shareholder because of his attitude.<p>So here we are. At this stage our relationship with our VC completely lies in ruins. I'm very ambivalent, the only thing really keeping me from quitting my company is the strong loyalty I feel towards my awesome team of founders and employees. If I'm going to develop a new product and perhaps bring in new funding, why do it in a company where I'm already diluted and the VC has proven to be a huge liability during financing and potential exits? On the other hand, if I start anew I will have to bootstrap completely from scratch instead of leveraging the great team and cashflow I already have.<p>If I do leave, the company will probably saunter along just fine without me. Maybe new management is just what it takes for it to skyrocket.<p>I would love to get an outside view on the above. Bash my head in if you think it is needed, that would be very refreshing. I have a really great lawyer at hand, so whatever legal advice you give me can do little harm because I run everything by him. What do you think?",1298935545

Most of the actors that go to the oscars aren't there to get drunk or laid, for them it's a chance to talk shop with their colleauges. When James Cameron is talking to Natalie Portman he isn't chatting her up, he's trying to get her to star in his new movie. If, by accident, John Cusack gets drunk at one of the clubs he gets into for free he'll be all over the tabloids and he won't get that next role, so he can't do it.<p>A friend of mine just came back from a tour with a known rock-band. They worked hard from nine in the morning until after midnight six days a week. The last day of the week they just wanted to get home to their families. No screwing around with models, no getting drunk and no clubbing. Just hard work. The rockstar life is mostly something the media makes up.<p>Remember that the grass is always greener on the other side. Or as Brad Pitt once said ""Fame's a bitch man""",1298935217

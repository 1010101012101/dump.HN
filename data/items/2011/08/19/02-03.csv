2902031,comment,2900633,2900633,3,0,nQuo,,,"I feel that one of the main problems with webOS is that many people like it a lot for the design and want to see its potential unleashed.<p>Yet users don't vote for webOS with their wallets and developers don't make webOS apps, because many question whether it can be a sustainable mobile platform. Another reason is that the hardware running webOS has always been a bit of a let-down.<p>On a side note, I can't help but wonder if Steve Jobs feels a little saddened to see HP's lack of vision and commitment nowadays to make great products. Yes, HP's obviously a major competitor but mostly in the PC industry where it makes much slimmer margins. Jobs' first summer job was at Hewlett-Packard and also where he met Steve Wozniak, so it's more of a personal sting to witness the once iconic company giving up on post-PC devices.",1313722278

2901970,comment,2900878,2901033,4,0,derefr,,,"> Size is always a trade-off and there won't be one standard for encoding.<p>I don't see why, in modern multi-core CPUs/GPUs where 99% of time is spent idle, we can't just have ""raw"" text (UCS4) to manipulate in memory, and <i>compressed</i> text (using any standard stream compression algorithm) on disk/in the DB/over the wire.<p>Anything that's not UCS4 is already variable-length-encoded, so you lose the ability to random-seek it anyway; and (safely performing) any complex text manipulation, e.g. upper-casing, requires temporarily converting the text to UCS4 anyway. At that point, you may as well go all the way, and serialize it as efficiently as possible, if you're just going to spit it out somewhere else. I guess the only difference is that string-append operations would require un-compressing compressed strings and then re-compressing the resultbut you could defer that as long as necessary using rope[1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(computer_science)</a>",1313720973

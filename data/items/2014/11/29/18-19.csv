Being a fish out of water in a way that a German would have felt in 1960s Marakesh was a lot greater. The traveller’s ability to plan and control the experience a lot more limited. Inevitably, the traveller was faced with a lot of experiences, people and places that they had no stereotypes and biases to understand through. They couldn’t make make sense of things. They would have just had to accept things without classifying, judging or using the normal mental models we have for making sense of our world. It was much more possible to have a humbling experience.<p>These days not just travel, but all contact with foreign place is a much more accessible, easy and unchallenging recreation.

One relatively consistent trait I&#x27;ve seen is that they all were brutally honest about the work people did and a person&#x27;s particular strengths and weaknesses. This is often construed with meanness.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the same trait, but many people often interpret criticism of their work as meanness. Sometimes it&#x27;s quite hard to not see it that way, since an honest criticism may actually point out major flaws in your overall skills, talent, etc, not just some local error you made. Of course, the consensus forms that this person is an asshole. Unlike CEOs and other high level decision makers, most people do not face consequences if they do not call a spade a spade and risk offending others, so this makes it very easy for these types of brutally honest people to stand out as being unnecessarily critical. The net result often seems to be, however, better work out of the people who can take the heat, and a stronger overall team since the people who take criticism personally end up leaving.<p>Overall I think I completely disagree with pg here, it seems the most incredibly successful people are at least <i>perceived</i> as mean, because they have a character trait which allows them to cut through bullshit and not care about hurting a person&#x27;s feelings by giving objective criticism.",1417286512

We have known for a while that L2 networks do not scale very well but have been restricted by the need to support link-local communications due to legacy applications. Once you take this fundamental constraint off the table, L3 networks offer a far superior solution even though there are still challenges with isolation and mobility.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t believe Facebook builds applications that require link local non-routeables or requires an affinity between applications and the faux host identity (e.g. the IP Address). As you point out there is a tight coupling between the mac address, IP Address and Point of Attachment due to a flawed model which has existed since IP split from TCP in version 4 of the protocol (i.e. the one common in use today). All of the monkey-patching (i.e. Trill, SPB, LISP, VXLAN, NVGRE, etc..) has been to deal with this flawed model.<p>For those existing application that do suffer from this affinity the solution de jour has been to use encapsulation protocols (i.e. network virtualization) to solve mobility (Loc/ID split) while also improving isolation by adding a new network namespace (e.g. ContextID, VNI, Switch Name, etc... This actually could have been avoided if we hadn&#x27;t lost the inter-networking layer of the stack (see John Day&#x27;s work for an explanation).<p>Just because you build a Fat-Tree network as devised by Charles Leiserson based on Charlie Clos, you have to realize that because of the statistical nature of communications,  shared resources and pathologies related to out of order packets, saturating the bi-section is extremely difficult.. Some studies show that latency goes exponential at just 40% offered load. In building any network the ability to maximize throughput is dependent on the topology first, then routing and flow-control.. Fat-Trees are designed to maximize the bi-section for worst-case pairs-permutation (i.e source communicating with each destination across the min-cut..) and such can waste a proportion of the capacity of the network depending on the workload. Again, a longer conversation :)..",1417285768

I was terrible back then, doing builds like an automaton following a recipe - I lost as soon as someone stepped out of the cannon and did something non-standard. Why? Easy. I had the mechanics but was missing the know-how on what made them work and how to apply them.<p>Instead of going that route I started to watch better players. They quickly diverged from the builds - enlightenment came when I noticed that they were playing reactionary. They observed their opponents and made decisions.<p>Why am I expanding now? Not because the build says so but because my opponent invested in tech so will not have the resources to pressure my new base etc. The basics are important, if you have your mechanics down then your mind is clear to react and just execute the movements to achieve the goal you want based on what you observed.<p>It works the same with programming. If you&#x27;re stumbling with language syntax, your framework - the basics. You will then loose a lot of time hunting small issues and constantly loosing the big picture. When you&#x27;re basics are down you are free to experiment and will notice patterns that beg you to apply one of the basics you learned.<p>Some problems are specific, fall into the &#x27;what data structure, algorithm&#x27; should I use. Some are structure/flow related - how do I make those two things connect to each other and pass data around. Some are new - but they all mingle and repeat themselves very often.<p>When you read a lot of code, write a lot of code - you will start noticing the patterns.

Classic Unix simply didn&#x27;t have shared libraries (or threads).  Plan 9 and Go explicitly have this heritage; they don&#x27;t support shared libraries.<p>Apache is Unix style because it uses stable protocols between application and server, like CGI, FastCGI, etc.  It also uses textual logs, unlike systemd.<p>I would also argue that systemd encompasses more diverse functionality than either X or Apache, which is saying a lot.  The bigger a system is, the worse a monolithic architecture is.<p>But you&#x27;re right that modern Unix doesn&#x27;t follow Unix style in many ways.  I am not arguing for purity -- shared libraries are useful, and graphics don&#x27;t fit well within Unix style.  But I do think it is worth understanding the Unix style, for very a practical reason.

Counsellors identify psychopaths based on a pattern of actions that lack empathy. A psychopath might be very &quot;nice&quot; when he meets you, but as soon as he can benefit by throwing you under the bus, he does so with no display of remorse. The lack of empathy is the defining characteristic of the psychopath--a non-psychopath will refrain from throwing someone under the bus because they empathize with that person. Steve Jobs fucked over his colleagues without remorse. Woz then gave them all money because Woz felt bad--Woz showed that he has empathy. Jobs showed he does not. This is why psychologists consider Jobs an obvious case of a psychopath.<p>3. Vulnerable people discover psychopaths due to the classic psychopath turn. When at a moment&#x27;s notice the person you thought was so nice to you turns on you and you realize they were just using you.

8674453,comment,8673907,8674217,0,0,Sakes,,,"Thanks, I have a much clearer view.  A little background on me so you can see I know what I&#x27;m talking about.  I&#x27;m a 12+ year web app developer who specializes in front-end development.<p>Proficient in:<p>SQL, Java, Hibernate, c#, ASP.net, ASP MVC + Razor, Entity Framework, Coldfusion, Railo, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Javascript, jQuery, Mootools, Backbonejs, css, LESS, bootstrap.<p>Familiar with:\nIIS, Apache, Tomcat, Maven, Artifactory<p>Currently Mastering:<p>knockoutjs, knockbackjs<p>Dabbled in:<p>Python, Ubuntu web server, Pylons.<p>So here are my assumptions about you, and I&#x27;ll follow it up with advice:<p>You are not a developer or engineer, you are a hacker.  You&#x27;ve probably thought or said something to the effect of &quot;Users don&#x27;t care what the code looks like, all that matters is that it works&quot;.  You are probably good at getting things working quickly but given a large project can find yourself weighed down with code debt and that once rapid productivity rate comes screeching to a halt.<p>I think of programmers as having personality types, and if you match up the correct personality type with the correct tasks, that individual can be very productive.  So, if I am correct, you are a hacker.  You are best suited for working on prototypes or at custom software shops where getting an initial app launched is way more important than code maintainability.<p>You have a long background in market analysis, I&#x27;m guessing 4+ years, so if you can find a company creating software to aid in market analysis, you could champion yourself as both a developer and domain expert to that company.<p>Advice:<p>1) You have sent out roughly 168 resumes over a 6 month period and none of those have resulted in an interview.  So either your resume is terrible, or you are applying to the wrong jobs, but I suspect its most likely both. Send me your resume, and I&#x27;ll look over it with my friend and we&#x27;ll critique it for you.  hnsakes [at] gmail.com<p>2) Rewrite your resume from scratch, referencing your original resume for content.  Your resume should always be coupled with a cover letter that has been tailored to the position you are applying for.<p>3) Understand the value that you bring and tell the employer how you will help them.  Going on my assumptions above that would consist of banging out prototypes or small to medium sized applications quickly.<p>4) Apply to companies that are looking to start transitioning from people services to technology services.  For example, I am currently contracting with a book publisher helping them move from selling books to delivering content via a web application.<p>5) Apply to custom software shops.  They will have projects of all sizes, and hackers typically shine in these environments.<p>6) Apply to companies providing market analysis services where you can leverage your domain experience to add value.<p>7) Always apply to companies looking for a .NET / c# developer, don&#x27;t pick up a new tech stack unless you need to, meaning some company is interested in hiring you but they don&#x27;t use c#.<p>Critique:<p>You think c# is bad, you think visual studio is bad, but you don&#x27;t have the experience to know why nor were you able to find the good parts in those techs.<p>Visual Studio is pretty amazing, c# is pretty amazing.  The only problem with visual studio is that it is not IntelliJ, the only problem with c# is the web is polluted with poor code snippets due to a disproportionate amount of poor developers in that community compared to others.  Building Microsoft based web solutions is just too easy to get started with, and developers tend to plateau pretty quickly as a result.<p>Entity Framework, is just awesome.  I just wish I could code this stuff in intellij rather than VS though.<p>So this is my initial response.  I&#x27;d be happy to go into more details over email or in this comment thread.  This won&#x27;t be hard to fix.  You will have a job soon enough, you just need to know yourself better, and allocate your resources correctly (fine tuning the jobs you apply for, polishing your resume, and as a last resort working with new technologies after you have addressed the job search techniques/resume).",1417284322

While I would want a lawyer&#x27;s approval for peace of mind, and the administrative safeguards are actually nontrivial, I&#x27;m pretty sure Wikipedia meets the technical safeguards.<p>The Access Control requirements: Everyone should have an individual user account protected by some kind of authentication, limited to the permissions its user actually needs, and should log off (and/or be automatically logged off) when they&#x27;re not actively using that account.<p>Duh? Every multiuser system designed by a remotely competent solo developer does this. Your local Starbucks&#x27;s POS implements this. So does my small-town public library. And Wikipedia.<p>Transmission integrity: as far as I know, you have to explicitly go out of your way to not get this for free from TCP. If you&#x27;re using HTTPS, even better.<p>Audit controls: Wikipedia seems to nail this one, since Mediawiki is built around versioned storage with nice visualizations of diffs and reporting on changes. Even without considering security, the natural paradigm for a clinical EHR system is read-and-append-only since you are documenting interactions and the past doesn&#x27;t change. (Sure, mistakes happen, but that&#x27;s probably worth acknowledging with an explicit correction.) Otherwise, what&#x27;s so hard about throwing in a logger.log() describing what&#x27;s happening when a user does something interesting?<p>I&#x27;ve skipped encryption, but encryption is &quot;addressable&quot; so you don&#x27;t have to encrypt anything if it would be too difficult. (So long as you document that choice.) Use HTTPs where feasible, like you should be doing anyway? Encryption of database servers doesn&#x27;t make much sense since they key would be in memory all the time anyway, but maybe pick &quot;encrypted LLVM&quot; when you install the OS? And that&#x27;s the technical safeguards.<p>The guide claims that my line of thinking is a trap people fall into, but you don&#x27;t making a compelling case as to <i>why</i> the technical safeguards are too hard to do yourself or even a burden.<p>HIPAA isn&#x27;t talking about static analysis, formal verification, vulnerability research, strong cryptography, hardened kernels, airgaps, side channels, timing attacks, HSMs, 2-factor authentication, etc. It isn&#x27;t about secure code, nor any of the interesting/&quot;real&quot; security that HN likes to talk about. A HIPAA security audit is a checklist and a very expensive Nessus scan. This isn&#x27;t Bruce Schneier-level stuff. I&#x27;d be surprised if any HIPAA violation was even interesting enough for DEFCON. HIPAA isn&#x27;t like the FIPS rules. On the technical/software side, it&#x27;s more like an idiot-check. At least, that was my conclusion after doing  a bunch of research for one of my employers.<p>If I were running a business involving PHI, the thing I&#x27;d want most is a lawyer to tell me what I actually need to change based on what the law actually is. It doesn&#x27;t really seem like help is necessary to implement the technical safeguards.",1410334773

The popping console is annoying, even when you know how to use a terminal : navigating through the filesystem is painful in cmd.exe an starting an instance from explorer is not always an available option.<p>Netcat had an interesting approach: when you start it without any command line argument (say, by double-clicking), it opens a prompt and wait for a command. Using this idea together with some help message might be the simplest solution.",1410332949

The page makes both crash.<p>I&#x27;ve always believed that Google making their pages crash iPad&#x27;s Safari can have benefits, but obviously the web developers who produced the Live page used only Safari on their big computers and never tested them enough on the iPads. That alone is really unacceptable execution.<p>The reasons the servers got under bigger pressure was obviously the wrong decision to have the video content page and the live picture and text updating resource and script hungry page as one and the same. The browsers of the viewers crashed, they attempted to view again, producing much more load to the servers than it would be if these unfortunate decisions (everything on the one page) haven&#x27;t been made.<p>Independently, the stream was obviously botched at the source.

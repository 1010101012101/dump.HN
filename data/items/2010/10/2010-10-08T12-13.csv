In my life, i've had a few trysts with writing and ended up buying an Olivetti when i was in college. that's been a good investment and it has also had the effect (which i find positive) of slowing down the speed that i type at and making me more thoughtful about how i write (i have a two color, non-correcting ribbon). My love for that flawed device is probably similar to model m keyboard affection.<p>Writer seems, conceptually, like using an old ibm word processor (remember those with the one/four line text display that would then typewrite that onto the page?)

I can think of countless sites that need this.<p>Even if when you embed you take the colours of the site you are embedded in you still need to improve your own site to make the pitch; it just looks too plain jane at the moment. I'd recommend heading over to colour lovers for some inspiration from their most popular palettes.
<a href=""http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/most-loved/all-time/meta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/most-loved/all-time/met...</a><p>You could build a database from those palettes, detect colours on a users page and automatically select a complementary colour from the database for your widget when you are presenting the demo (or three different colours to select from as little boxes in the top right, also - perhaps provide an inverted colour option for the readability widget). A test embeddable phase that works from their last week of posts/RSS feed would also be something cheap/fast to implement. So they can point it at their blog and then get a quick demo of the search working on their last 20 posts in a handsome widget that already looks like it belongs on their site.<p>Also rather than site owners, perhaps you could work towards the readability widget thing you have going. So a user comes to you, plugs in all their sites and then they can read cleanly with that widget and/or do a mass export to pdf or their kindle. So bookmarks+readability+pdf/ebook = personal magazine specifically for bulk reading/offline reading/distraction-free reading. I know there are endless RSS readers out there, but how many are catering to ebook readers with a pleasant search or even older types who like to print things off. Your main strengths are in user interface and simplifying various workflows, rather than search technology, so I'd play to those strengths.",1286542215

With the changes described here, we will still have schools full of mostly-bored students.  School still sounds like it will be a mostly-passive activity for students, which naturally results in low amounts of development.<p>On a much broader level, I think certain deeply rooted ideas need to be reconsidered.  For example, how beneficial is it to split up disciplines like we do, such as have math completely separate from the sciences, or reading separate from the humanities?  Or for that matter, is such a ridiculous focus on math and certain sciences and humanities really needed in school to the same degree?  What other topics in our world have grown to be more important?  Should math be taught in taking one minuscule bit at a time out of any meaningful context, or can concepts be lumped into projects that add contextual and experiential meaning? On a different note, a lot of people can't understand that learning can take place outside of a traditional classroom with a teacher.  Do we even need traditional classrooms anymore?  What structures would be more beneficial to learning?  And, one last point, should structured or semi-structured school take up 9-12+  hours every day of the week (including homework) for a majority of the year?  When do students have time for their own thinking, discovering, and involved and time-consuming interests?",1286541572

Let them have all their preconceptions shattered, and their sense of what it takes to build software modified towards reality.  Let them get all the frustration out of their system until they're ready for you to show them what <i>good</i>, genuinely fast work looks like.<p>The quickest way to accomplish this is to tell them your rate upfront.  They'll go ""ouch"", at which point you can gently point them towards rentacoder, safe in the knowledge that they'll be back in 6 months time with a bit of perspective and a willingness to pay your extortionate rate so long as you promise never to put them through anything like what they just suffered ever again.",1286539321

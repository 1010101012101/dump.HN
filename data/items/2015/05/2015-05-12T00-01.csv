A good place to start is the Alcor Patient Care Trust [1]:<p><i>At Alcor, patient storage costs are paid from the Patient Care Trust. This conservative funding arrangement is designed to cover the cost of patient storage solely from the income from the Trust, thereby assuring that such funding will continue indefinitely into the future. The irrevocable Patient Care Trust is included under Alcor&#x27;s tax-exempt status, but nevertheless is a separate legal entity that provides liability protection for these assets. This arrangement is one of the reasons our members have confidence in Alcor.<p>It doesn&#x27;t do any good to use the most advanced techniques to get our members into cryopreservation unless we can keep them there, as well as build capital to eventually fund revival and reintegration. Ongoing care for cryopreservation patients is the number one element of our purpose in being cryonicists, and financial protection for the patients is a critical component of this. There is no use in starting this possibly centuries-long project, if we don&#x27;t do centuries-long financial planning. Providing this kind of protection through a conservative, long-term view of storage costs is one of the main reasons why cryopreservation costs so much.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.alcor.org/AboutAlcor/patientcaretrustfund.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alcor.org/AboutAlcor/patientcaretrustfund.html</a>",1431391868

With one distinction: What they did, was a joke compared to what is going on today in many western countries.<p>The other thing is, that in my opinion, what ruined the country most in the long term was the reign of Miss Thatcher. The total sale of the state and the rise of the banks stripped the country from any other options (all other industry is in ruins today or sold to foreign (e.g. German) corporations) -- GB must give the banks a free hand, or crash. And when they do, we all in Europe loose (also GB).<p>I also read a statement from a Economist, who largely criticized Camerons idea of further reducing the states spending (as much I understood, by privatization).

Most shops that have people in early 20s at junior positions in web development most likely will make excuses and not hire you in those roles.<p>You might be able to break in web development after joining a company in system engineering or devOps role and showing your web dev chops by using it to solve your and your colleagues itch in system engineering. In my last job, a colleague made the same transition by doing things for example creating an internal web site for system engineering group for weekly status report, storing online important customer configuration files, indexing documents for search etc. things that were annoying to people in his group and he made them suck less. Soon, he was asked to join our intranet development group, it was a lateral move for him instead of starting from bottom.<p>Another avenue will be to do freelance. Nobody cares about your age as long as you can deliver the work requested by client.<p>Personally, I made a similar move from system engineering in my mid-40s to webdev/analytics. It was clear during the transition while interviewing for webdev/analytics role that no one will hire me in such roles due to age as well as elementary quality of the code that I write.<p>But then something magical happened, I created a web app to scratch my own itch using the same quality of code that hiring managers were not impressed with. I guess thousands of others had the same itch and now I have 1,700 users, both individuals and businesses. Suddenly, I was being considered expert not in webdev but the industry vertical my web app targeted. I now consult in that industry vertical at rates much higher than what any webdev job would have paid.",1431390966

Maybe if you breed with a better cast and become part of their family your future would be brighter, so we will arrange a marriage to make this so.  This isn&#x27;t some far off idea - this is the norm in some places, and it is disgusting.<p>Do you support eugenics?  Do you think less of intelligent people who choose to adopt rather than breed?  Do you think overpopulation is a non-issue?  Do you believe cast systems are useful?<p>Human knowledge and functional advancement is vastly more important than genetics or children.  Jonas Salk had three children, but anyone who claimed &quot;his children are his greatest accomplishment&quot; would be laughed at.  His impact on mankind was direct.  Direct impact is always better, because no matter how many generations your DNA is passed on, it is all meaningless until they at some point take action and do something.  Mindless breeding is something rabbits can do.<p>There is this desperately sad tendency to want to &quot;pass the buck&quot; to children... sure, MY life was a huge waste, but maybe my children will be something special, maybe it was all worth it because of them.... or my grandchildren.  People who do something in the here and now are to be admired because they are a rarity.",1431389536

You can choose to break the cycle, if you like.  Acknowledging  the other person&#x27;s opinion as valid is the first step.  After that, you may or may not want to encourage them to expand their view.  However, if you think that the other person is unable to understand this point you may choose not to waste your time.<p>I suspect that you could find a simplified label to describe the comment of the parent post, but perhaps it would be better to consider their opinion as valid and move on.",1431389534

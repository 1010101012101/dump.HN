This lets people configure it how they want, disable projects they don't care about (each project shows up independently in Growl), and isn't as disruptive all of the time.<p>We also use a Google Talk conference bot running an account on our Google Apps, powered by:  <a href=""http://coders.meta.net.nz/~perry/jabber/confbot.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coders.meta.net.nz/~perry/jabber/confbot.php</a> .

If your cable is a mile long, accelerating and decelerating it costs quite some energy, too. Long cable also have problems with swaying and elasticity.<p>Also, a main problem with high rise buildings is loss of floor space at lower heights (the water, electricity, waste, and person traffic of floors 2 to N all have to pass though floor 1)<p>Ropeless elevators can have a huge advantage there, as they allow one to hang multiple elevators in a single shaft that both service the full range of floors. Yes, that requires sophisticated software to prevent lift cars from having to pass through each other too often (some designs allow cabines to do that by making it possible for the cars to move horizontally, too), but it is an active research area.<p>&quot;ropeless elevator&quot; is not on Wikipedia yet; the best (but tangential and possibly slightly commercial) I could find Googling it is <a href=""http://www.barkermohandas.com/images/Integrated%20Vertical%20&%20Horizontal%20Transport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barkermohandas.com/images/Integrated%20Vertical%2...</a>, which is about a system with wires that allows one to move cars horizontally by sliding them from one car frame to another using linear motors.",1371368966

But if the repeated bubble/burst economy of US has taught us anything, having economics knowledge in the grand scale amounts for jack shit. Its really hard to predict, precisely whats going to happen with the economy when your country is as big as USA/China. You can only have good guestimate. Having said that, my problem is with this kind of sentences:<p>>China&#x27;s bubble is about to burst.<p>What does &quot;about to&quot; means, when you have been reading about it for the last10 years? Is it tomorrow, next year, 10 years from now?<p>One things I understand about economy of developing country (and yes China is one despite being second largest economy) is that, there is always some scope for growth. Unlike matured economy like USA/European countries where almost every aspect of the country&#x27;s economy is tied to each other. If something goes belly up, it usually affects other parts of the economy. This is not usually true for developing countries like China. They don&#x27;t depend on a single source of market to survive, there is always some scope for growth and something else to pick you up from the slump.<p>Developed nations are like almost full glass of water, you have to be careful how fast you try to feel it up.

The author goes on to say:<p>> Because the same legal standards that apply to phone calls also apply to e-mail messages, text messages, and instant messages, Nadler&#x27;s disclosure indicates the NSA analysts could also access the contents of Internet communications without going before a court and seeking approval.<p>Meaning the US Gov&#x27;t believes it has as much legal right to access e-mail as it does phone calls. Claims that they&#x27;ve done so in the same way (that is, in massive numbers with very little oversight or attention) are speculation. As more evidence begins to surface, it seems like telephone companies like AT&T and Verizon have been far more complicit in the NSA&#x27;s indiscriminate surveillance programs than companies eg. Google that control e-mail - when&#x27;s the last time you saw AT&T publish a transparency report detailing government requests for user data?",1371367312

At the same time, real estate which was the engine of the economy <i>is</i> in meltdown (source: first hand discussions with developers, observation). The cost of an apartment in a third-tier Chinese city is <i>far</i> higher than that of neighbours.

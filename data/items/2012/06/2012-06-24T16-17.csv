Both Android and iOS have very distinctive userland technologies layered over open UNIX-like kernels. While a cross-platform SDK might give you access to almost all of both platform features, it is very unlikely to be able to abstract those features in a way that results in portable code.<p>For example, Android's component-based app architecture runs very deep in Android implementations. If you subvert it, or plaster over it with an abstraction, you lose the ability to minimize your app footprint by having relatively small components ""destroyed"" or swapped out of memory in Android's unique approach to making Java memory management work across component and process boundaries.<p>Windows 8 for mobile devices is yet another distinctive OS, with a unique kernel and similar, for still very distinctive managed language runtime, plus legacy compatibility.<p>We're in an era of OS and managed language runtime innovation. Each one is striving to provide the optimal feature set, and that often involves the way in which apps and components of apps communicate and cooperate. plastering over the semantics of those large and deep architectural differences is going to result in a lowest common denominator result.",1340556318

you have with open discussions, particularly open technical discussions,

doesn't really matter.""<p>Technical discussions can often be contentious, but often, they are
contentious for the ""right"" reason, people care. When people actually
care about building the ""best"" possible code, emotions run high, even
though such unrestrained enthusiasm has substantial drawbacks. As you
already know far too well, many thrive on the competition and conflict
as much as they thrive on getting things right.<p>As Peter wonderfully points out, none of us can claim ""A total lack of
crazy,"" or for that matter, ""A total lack of asshole."" On top of these
all too human failings, we also have our moments when we just get it all
wrong. It happens. Roll with it. Let it go, but learn from it.<p>Good communication takes practice. Ask grellas sometime about the effort
he put into learning to write well. It shows. He wasn't born the skill
he has. He learned it. If you stop communicating, you're robbing
yourself of a chance to practice.<p>As for me, I rarely post on HN due to my health not being very good. I
deal with chronic pain, and often it hurts too much to type. As you
might imagine, when I'm hurting a lot, I can often be less than pleasant
company, and it's best for everyone for me to just remain silent. For
me, typing comes at a cost. It means I'll be more sore by the end of the
day. The cost has taught me something important; the things I say should
make a difference, but often, my opinions don't really matter.<p>Treebeard: ""You must understand, young Hobbit, it takes a long time to

4153583,comment,4152695,4152695,10,0,edj,,,"There's another school of thought that attributes the variety of hair, skin, and eye color in Europe to sexual selection rather than the brightness of the sun. In brief, Europe during the last glacial period offered very little food for women to gather, so women were almost completely dependent upon men for hunted meat. As a result of this imbalance, women developed striking looks to attract men.<p>For an example of this line of thinking in the evolutionary literature see: ""European hair and eye color: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?"" (Frost 2006) [1]<p><i>Human hair and eye color is unusually diverse in northern and eastern Europe. The many alleles involved (at least seven for hair color) and their independent origin over a short span of evolutionary time indicate some kind of selection. Sexual selection is particularly indicated because it is known to favor color traits and color polymorphisms. In addition, hair and eye color is most diverse in what used to be, when first peopled by hunter-gatherers, a unique ecozone of low-latitude continental tundra. This type of environment skews the operational sex ratio (OSR) of hunter-gatherers toward a male shortage in two ways: (1) men have to hunt highly mobile and spatially concentrated herbivores over longer distances, with no alternate food sources in case of failure, the result being more deaths among young men; (2) women have fewer opportunities for food gathering and thus require more male provisioning, the result being less polygyny. These two factors combine to leave more women than men unmated at any one time. Such an OSR imbalance would have increased the pressures of sexual selection on early European women, one possible outcome being an unusual complex of color traits: hair- and eye-color diversity and, possibly, extreme skin depigmentation.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(05)00059-0/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(05)00059-0/abstr...</a>",1340554385

You've done particularly well during one review period, and they're seeking to reward you (preferably without spending too much -- if your environment is similar to some I'm familiar with).  Introduce the idea/desire to work one day a week remote.  One out of five may not seem too risky.  Add some personal arguments, and the savings on commute expense (maybe the business has some degree of ""green"" initiative or attitude, however real or ""for show"" it may be).<p>If you get the occasional day remote, build a track record of its particular effectiveness and an argument for (eventually) increasing this.  Ease them into it.  And be very careful/mindful of avoiding breeding co-worker resentment.  Keep your head down, and cast it in terms of ""needed/required"" as opposed to a perk.<p>2) Re-evaluate your need/desire to stay.  You may have a lot invested.  But, how much do you risk if you burn out?  And how quickly will they, in turn, throw you under the bus if you do?<p>Akin to this:  BE PRO-ACTIVE.

The community is one of the most immature you can find online, the content is very poor, and I am disgusted when I see the little 'lynch mobs' that they form up every once in awhile when they feel like vigilante justice is appropriate.<p>Digg is junk, and I have absolutely no respect for it. Scribd might want to worry if they are becoming popular on Digg...do they really want that audience to be using their site?",1176691937

How can you tell if one of your ideas is worth pursuing?'</i> [3] posts. So you now have some suggestions on how to get your ideas and how to filter them, so what is your hard, best problem?<p>Example:<p>A previous problem I was working on was to reduce the cognitive overload of everyday tasks on desktop users [4]  by capturing user input and only displaying information that is important now or in the immediate future.  Using combinations of NLP, integration with desktop tools and novel user interaction taking cues from Adventure games. [5]<p><p>Reference<p>[0]  I was going to title it <i>'what's the hard problem you're currently working on?'</i> but this title from pg's article 'good & bad procrastination' is better.<p>[1] pg, 'Good and bad procrastination'<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/procrastination.html</a><p>[2] arasakik, 'How do you come up with your ideas for startups?'<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=12995"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=12995</a><p>[3] amichail, 'What is your idea filter?

It's based on the idea that if you capture lots of small bits of important information, work out what they contain, phone numbers, peoples names, \nyou can get the machine to do the hardwork & spit out the necessary information  just in time as it's needed.<p>\n[5] But things have changed since then and I've moved on to some different hard problems after the bloke I was working with decided to take the safe route and do his PhD on the same topic.\n",1176689491

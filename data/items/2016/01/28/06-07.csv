10986767,comment,10984755,10986578,0,0,sathackr,,,"I believe they are referring to a beam-forming antenna when they say active phased array. Basically, timing of the RF signal to various portions of the antenna is altered such that it restricts and focuses the beam towards an intended target. The technology has only recently come to the point that it is practical for consumer level applications. I don&#x27;t see it helping with reflections, with endpoints all over, you&#x27;ll have a bunch of very strong beams scattering everywhere, but it can help push the signal further than a simple omni-directional or even sector antenna. I don&#x27;t believe it helps much with the received signal.<p>A real engineer will be able to answer the signal processing question much better than I, but to my knowledge, multipath can only be effectively dealt with when all versions of the signal originated from the same device. When you have effectively a stray signal, it&#x27;s difficult to tell even where the carrier is. There is some mitigation possible with timing of transmit/receive signals(usually with GPS), but this also requires some control over the propagation of the signal.<p>As far as weather, for most areas, 39ghz would probably be practical out to 2 miles, with some brief interruptions for very heavy rain. But with the bandwidth limitations, this isn&#x27;t in line with the stated goal of gigabit level service to high-density urban environments.<p>This would certainly be a last-mile tech, but the described target is high-density urban areas, where population densities far exceed 1000/sq mile. I can&#x27;t see this technology ever being able to function at gigabit speeds with those densities.<p>Mesh networking has it&#x27;s own issues. If you&#x27;re going to run it on the same frequency as your endpoints, then you are sharing spectrum with them and your overall bandwidth is significantly reduced. You can backhaul it on a different frequency, but now you have more equipment and expense, licensing, etc... I have to be careful saying it because I haven&#x27;t kept up with the lastest in mesh developments, but over the last 10 years, I have never seen a mesh network system work reliably with any sort of appreciable speed. Most have failed miserably. The idea looks great on paper, but rarely works out in the real world.<p>There are tons of last-mile tech available that work very well. FSO(free space optics)[1] is one of them. It has nearly unlimited bandwidth. It&#x27;s limitation is, it is, as the name implies, optical in nature, so line of sight is an absolute must. Currently available equipment is overpriced as well, but a newcomer could change that.<p>The FCC just opened up about 150mhz of spectrum in the 3.5ghz area also for last-mile delivery of wireless broadband - Citizens Broadband Radio Service[2]\nThis band is aimed at rural deployments, and isn&#x27;t concerned with pushing 1gb to everyone, but will go a long ways towards getting a lot of people on the internet at decent(20mb/s+) speeds.<p>The 5ghz unlicensed band is also very effective at distances under 2 miles, and can be pushed up to 100 miles in certain situations. There is about 600mhz of spectrum available here, some of it ideal for urban situations as it shares frequencies with weather radar and is under strict power restrictions that make it difficult to use for longer and rural connections.<p>On a tangent, I deal with people nearly every day that can&#x27;t even get 3mb/s DSL service. The only high-speed that&#x27;s available to them is satellite, with data caps and horrendous latency, or 3g/4g with spotty speeds and availability, data caps, and impractical per GB billing. When they are able to get even 10mb/s of real internet, they are happier than a 5 year old on Christmas morning. It&#x27;s by far the most rewarding thing I get to do. It would be nice to see more money flowing towards things like this. But not like FRBA [3] -- Essentially $24 million wasted.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communicati...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/12-354"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fcc.gov/rulemaking/12-354</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://blog.tmcnet.com/on-rads-radar/2013/04/florida-broadband-litigation-woes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tmcnet.com/on-rads-radar/2013/04/florida-broadba...</a><p>edit:\nfix footnotes",1453964001

I think it would have the opposite effect though. In most countries, the welfare system harshly punishes people who do a small amount of work, withdrawing benefit at a very high marginal rate. This is a massive disincentive to finding work. With a basic income, people can for example do voluntary work. People on sickness benefit can gradually try to go back into work, doing a few hours per week. If you can top up your income without being penalised for it I reckon quite a lot of people currently on welfare would start working a little.",1453963955

Heuristics is more common at lower levels of play.<p>When Grandmaster&#x27;s rely on pattern recognition, they are using their vast repertoire of remembered positions as a way to identify opportunities of play.  It&#x27;s not that they think the move looks right, it&#x27;s that they played a lot of tactical puzzles, and because of this pattern recognition, they are now <i>capable of identifying</i> decisive attacks that can then be objectively calculated within the brain to be seen as leading to checkmate or a piece advantage.<p>They don&#x27;t make the move because of the pattern or heuristic.  They make the move because the pattern allowed them to see the objective advantage in making that move.<p>------<p>As for your point about a move being objectively good:  Unless you completely solve the game of chess, there will never be always one move in every situation that&#x27;s objectively the best.  In many games (and you will see this in computer analysis), 2 or 3 moves will hold high promise, while others will hold less.  From an objective standpoint all these three moves could be objectively better than all others, but it could be hard to justify that one is necessarily better than another.<p>The reason for this is partly because between two objectively &#x27;equal&#x27; moves, there may be a rational reason for me to justify one over the other based on personal considerations (e.g. because I am familiar with the opening, because I played and analyzed many games similar to this line, because I can play this end game well, etc.)  Decisions based on those considerations are not what I would call heuristics, because they are based on objective reasons even if heuristics may have contributed to their formation within the mind.",1453961867

Having enough money to live for 10+ years unemployed is nice when suddenly your current job is driving you nuts. Or you want to hop into a new field. Or start a sustainable privately-owned company that doesn&#x27;t need / couldn&#x27;t benefit from VC-style growth.<p>Having more stuff doesn&#x27;t make one happier by default. Stability is more important. The tradeoff is status among certain groups of people; and if you care, then keep doing what you&#x27;re doing I guess.",1453960883

Motherland is a very specific term that&#x27;s been ingrained into English most likely because of the close personal relationship between people and their native countries, which would have been Britannia for many English speakers when the language was developing. There isn&#x27;t really that same deep and universal connection when talking about organizations, so a similar term probably wouldn&#x27;t develop anytime soon.",1453960868

Thought of sharing it with the community, in case anyone is interested in investing.<p>===========================================================================<p>Sub: A message from our CEO<p>Hi there,<p>In an unusual turn, I’m not writing today to suggest playlists we’ve hand-picked for you (though I&#x27;ve slipped in a few that our community love at the end of this email). Instead, I’m writing about potentially investing in 8tracks.<p>Under US law, only wealthy individuals and venture capitalists have historically had the ability to invest in startups. This changed last summer: the JOBS Act now allows anyone to invest in private companies. Unlike typical crowdfunding platforms (like Kickstarter), this new process would allow you to actually own stock in 8tracks.<p>8tracks was founded to showcase the passion and talent of people who care about great music and wish to share it, delivering the perfect playlist for a listener’s taste, time and place. As our DJs and listeners have both created and promoted this infinite soundtrack, so too should they have the opportunity to finance it by taking a stake in the company while we’re still relatively small.<p>New funding would allow us to build out a full music library for DJs, make it easier for listeners to find playlists they like, integrate 8tracks on new platforms, and refine our business model to continue to grow 8tracks for years to come.<p>This isn’t an offer to invest, and as of now you still can’t buy shares. I’d simply like to understand if you would be interested in participating. If there’s broad interest, we may file official paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pursue this new crowdfunding option.<p>Show your interest: https://www.seedinvest.com/8tracks/series.a<p>Thanks,<p>David Porter\nCEO & founder, 8tracks",1453960844

I grant you a lack of citations in the post, but my understanding is that much of the science stuff (meditation, will power, conforming to those around us, effects of advertising, etc) is fairly well established.

Sure, there is some irony in the affiliate link to a book (it is a legitimate meditation book that is considered useful), but it doesn&#x27;t affect the veracity of his statements.",1453960826

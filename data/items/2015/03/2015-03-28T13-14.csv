Our dog loved her crate; it was a nice, secure area where she could retreat when she was scared or overwhelmed, or when she just wanted a peaceful nap. We taught our kids that when she was in the crate, they had to absolutely ignore her and leave her totally alone.<p>Yes, we used the crate in order to speed up her housebreaking (working with her natural instincts), but she would also regularly use her crate (with the door open) on her own. Now, we&#x27;ve built her a little pseudo crate with a dog bed under a high-legged dresser. She goes there in any big thunderstorm still and will sometimes sleep there when the house is full of visitors.<p>I&#x27;m in favor of controlling dogs with <i>appropriate</i> use of crates/kennels, leashes, and fences. OTOH, I&#x27;ve never hit my kids, not because I think it&#x27;s inherently wrong, but because I  think it&#x27;s a terribly slippery slope, especially given the inherent stresses in raising an infant through toddler.<p>My parents and my (private Christian K-5) school both used corporal punishment on me, and I have to say that I don&#x27;t feel harmed nor scarred/scared by it. Looking back on the few instances that I specifically recall, it was done with positive intent and was basically effective.<p>I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether it&#x27;s inherently wrong categorically, or whether it&#x27;s just wrongly used by lazy parents in >99% of the instances.

To be honest I&#x27;m like the scientists that he questioned first... until I read this today, I always thought that the whole &quot;mental imagery&quot; concept was mainly a figure of speech, as when people say they feel butterflies in their stomach, and things like that. I can picture my breakfast table, but it&#x27;s more of a conceptual sketch than an actual image. I can only focus my thoughts on one thing at a time, and e.g. I know what the colors are but I&#x27;m not really &quot;seeing&quot; them in my mind - the fact that people can report a &quot;brightness&quot; value in relation to reality makes me think that my mind really works different from that of those people, for me the brightness question doesn&#x27;t even make sense.<p>Now I feel handicapped, although I suppose that maybe if I could conjure up these mental images, I wouldn&#x27;t be so good at symbolic processing. I guess this is why I have always preferred text to diagrams and such...<p>By the way, what I can do is hear music in my mind - and yes, this comes with pitch, volume, timbre, polyphony and everything. In fact if I&#x27;m at a place with a constant background noise - as in a plane, or near an air conditioning machine - I sometimes think I&#x27;m actually hearing it in reality (although I have learned that I&#x27;m not).

See here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language#Typed_versus_untyped_languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language#Typed_vers...</a><p>> so static typing usually refers to a language whose type system is somehow more restrictive at compile time than &quot;Everything is a variant type and we&#x27;ll work it out at runtime&quot;<p>Again, it was never suggested that Tulip has &quot;static types&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t of course.<p>What I said is that it has types. I don&#x27;t want to discuss how much better &quot;static typing&quot; is than &quot;dynamic typing&quot; or vice versa, this makes for a very boring discussion similar to Emacs vs. Vim and I&#x27;m not interested in it at all. I just object to the notion that &quot;static types&quot; are the only kind of types we can ever have in a language.<p>The problem is with &quot;static typing fanatics&quot;, really. They&#x27;d like to bend the terminology in a way which helps them promote static typing, for example by equating all types with static types. This is both dishonest and unnecessary. No serious static typing advocate would do this (I hope) - static typing is a great idea able to defend on its own, there&#x27;s no need to lie about &quot;the other side&quot; of the argument.<p>Well, all fanatics are like that. Way too much Kool-Aid, way too little critical thinking.",1427547869

Sure, there may be some artistic interpretation of the actual truth, but it was extremely motivating for me as an entrepreneur, thats for damn sure. The main takeaway I got apart from the importance of great mentors/friendors? That these guys worked their asses off to get where they are. Luck may be a small part of it, but pure perservernce is what saw them through.<p>Anyway, I thought it was a great read. Would recommend it, although with a pinch of salt since we have first-hand knowledge of some inaccuracies (see Joshua's comments above).",1217156112

My guess is that language snobs are INTP, whereas Blub programmers are more INTJ ...""</i><p>Do you really believe in the <i>""psycho-babble""</i> Myers-Briggs claims it tests? If you can show me any peer reviewed scientific studies that back the claims made by these tests I'd be more than happy to read them and judge for myself. Until then MBTI theories are as believable as any other pseudoscience.",1217155980

258140,comment,257491,257846,0,0,gaius,,,"The key point is, you can download Python and be doing useful work with it very quickly. If you are a complete novice, you could still probably have something actually useful done within a day. This is in part due to the library you get with it. The path into Python is very smooth too. I look back on my own code; at first I used it as a sort of glorified shell script, and now my code is all list comprehensions and lambdas. Python (the technology <i>and</i> the culture) caters to all levels. There's very rapid positive feedback, everything you learn immediately has a reward in power/productivity.<p>OCaml for example is a language I'm into at the moment, but it's a good thing I knew C first because sorting out it talking to my Oracle databases has been a complete shag (and, crucially, not something that the language developers, being academic researchers, give a stuff about). And my experience is, you have to be a relatively good OCaml programmer before you can start to be productive; there's a lot less opportunity to learn by doing, you have to study first. The point at which the positive feedback kicks in is a lot later.",1217154133

9178832,comment,9178117,9178739,0,0,dollaaron,,,"> It&#x27;s just not. It&#x27;s not easier than swiping a magnetic strip and signing something, or typing in sixteen digits (or using autofill or the site&#x27;s previously saved CC info) and pressing buy.<p>It&#x27;s much easier to take your phone, open an app, and scan a QR code, than to take out your credit card, transcribe a 16 digit number, check the expiration date, and enter the CSC (or is it CVC?).<p>Sure, for websites where your information is already saved, or if you leave all your credit card information saved in the browser, then this isn&#x27;t easier, but they&#x27;re still pretty comparable in my opinion. Even if it was slightly more work (which I personally disagree with), I would find that worth not having my credit card information saved by who knows how many third parties.<p>> It&#x27;s not good that I can&#x27;t demand a return or have recourse in the event of fraud.<p>I&#x27;ve never had to go to my credit card company for a refund, since most places I buy from will take refunds with a receipt or proof of purchase (and if they don&#x27;t, why would I buy from them?). Fraudulent purchases are another issue, but the risk of fraud is lower with bitcoin versus credit cards (no single number that allows access to all funds, a properly secured wallet is impossible to steal, although I know wallet security is still not the easiest thing to have).<p>> And it&#x27;s not a benefit that with bitcoin I have to spend the money first (to buy bitcoin) and wonder if it will hold its value, versus just buying stuff when I feel like it on credit and covering the transaction within 30 days at no interest cost.<p>This is a very real problem, and what I think will truly determine whether bitcoin gains anything near a large following.",1426006736

You are thinking of them on the QUALIFICATION side of the pipeline.  That is, you have entered a companies hiring pipeline and they are using Starfighter to determine whether you should stay in it or not.<p>The Starfighter team is trying to change the ACQUISITION side of the pipeline.  They are stepping in to the space where traditional recruiters feed applicants into the pipeline.  In marketing terms they are generating leads.  Their value proposition to the employer is that the leads they generate will be of higher caliber than the traditional contingent recruiters.  Their value proposition to you is that Starfighter is a) fun and/or b) at least better than dealing with a traditional recruiter.  Your Starfighter experience replaces your resume/cover letter that gets you into the pipeline.  Not your ability to navigate the pipeline once you get into it.<p>If your resume/traditional recruiters/responding to web ads/word of mouth is more valuable than Starfighter CTFs fun - hassle + employer payoff than you are quite simply not a good fit for the Starfigher Recruitment agency.  Just like you wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit for a DBA centric recruitment agency if you weren&#x27;t a DBA.<p>If I&#x27;m disappointed about anything in the announcement, its that it is obvious to me anyway, that they are NOT trying to replace the current qualification steps in a hiring pipeline.  Because to me, getting rid of that time wasting/unproductive process is the big value add, not shoveling more devs into the top of the pipeline (management at my company may feel differently).",1426006703

Many payment processors (I know Bitpay has this option) actually take the 0 confirmation transaction risk, allowing customers to pay instantly.<p>Transaction fees are not high, with a typical fee of .0001 bitcoin (3 cents), which is small compared to credit card fees. While work needs to be done converting to/from cash, actually using bitcoin (that you already have) to buy things is a better experience than using credit cards. You simply grab your phone, scan the QR code, and hit send. This is much better than entering your credit card for the thousandth time on another website, or being redirected to paypal, entering your password, and choosing your preferred payment option for the thousandth time (stop asking me to use Paypal Credit!).<p>Using an Android wallet such as Mycelium, or a desktop wallet like Electrum doesn&#x27;t require you to download the entire blockchain, and although that comes at the cost of some trust, I personally don&#x27;t find that problematic.<p>Basically, bitcoin has some problems, but I think some of your criticisms are no longer applicable to most everyday usage of it.",1426005484

This time around it worked flawlessly. To get into the park it requires you to scan your fingerprint as well, to buy anything  with a credit card linked to your account or use your dining plan requires your pin number. Other than that it&#x27;s pretty much tap and go.<p>The crazy part about the band that scares me is how much you are tracked because of it. After getting back we noticed we had Photo Pass photos, you know the photos after you get off the ride you used to buy. Now these photos are all digital and online, normally requiring you to tap your band at the end of the ride. Well they were just loaded onto our account, we never even scanned our bands for these rides or anything.<p>At the resorts you can buy a refillable mug, or you are given one on the dining plan. This refillable mug has an RFID chip in them, same with the paper cups. You must place your mug/cup on the sensor below your drink option in order for it to be read and dispense your drink. You can only get so much dispensed in a certain amount of time, or it will just stop dispensing. I also believe they had or used to have a limit per day on refills, I never hit it.<p>Not to mention their &quot;free&quot; Wi-Fi that they highly promote. I&#x27;m curious what all is going on behind the scene and how much is being used.

It&#x27;s one of the rare cases where we can pinpoint <i>exactly</i> how a disease/cancer works.<p>HPV wants its own DNA to be replicated properly - but a particular protein (P53) in humans impairs the virus&#x27; ability to replicate.  So the virus has evolved the ability to shut down that human protein.  The problem is that P53 also serves another role in humans other than helping to stop viruses - it is a DNA repair protein.  So the virus, by shutting down the ability of the cell&#x27;s ability to repair its own DNA it becomes much more susceptible to DNA-damaging events like smoking, UV light and old age generally.<p>There are a handful of proteins responsible for keeping your cells from becoming cancerous.  P53 is the name of one of these control proteins.  HPV has evolved to actively destroy P53.  So once a person is infected with HPV, their own P53 proteins are compromised and can no longer repair their DNA as efficiently as someone who is not infected with HPV.<p>The HPV vaccine is one of the very clearest lines of causality from atomic resolution biology through public policy.

How many of those would fit in an additional 1mm thickness of an average cell phone ? 50 ? 150 ? Won&#x27;t work for the monitors, of course. Also 30&quot;+ monitors are expensive, because they require a large amount of silicon to be precision manufactured, whereas resolution is only really limited by the speed of electronics (that&#x27;s why a cell phone 1080p screen is 60$ whereas a 30&quot; one is still $300+, and you can barely have higher res displays in bigger sizes. It&#x27;s cheaper than cpus and the like because it&#x27;s few layers and very large features, even the worst fab can produce perfectly adequate monitors, but you still need the material).<p>But an oculus rift can use a 60$ screen to make you think you&#x27;re in a room with a 600&quot; display (really, check their cinema demo. Wow. Just wow). Or a room with 50 600&quot; displays, no problem. Nimble VR can track your hands, and their competitors claim they can do it accurately enough to make you see a usable a virtual keyboard [1].<p>Why sit down at a docking station with GPU, monitors, storage when you can take it with you ? Why can&#x27;t I have 5 30&quot; monitors with full computer games while sitting on the train ? In an airplane ? In a 1 sq meter room ? Why would employers bother with any computers/peripherals other than a cellphone at work when a cellphone + occulus can provide a better and more useful experience ? Why can&#x27;t I sit down in the morning train, snap my fingers, and have 3 large monitors with my working environment appear around me, usable ? Why can&#x27;t I sit on a plane in an economy seat and do the same, all the while my mind convinced it&#x27;s really sitting in a huge outdoors open space ...<p>Additionally I wear glasses. Let me tell you, there&#x27;s no way to have the perfect glasses for every environment. Some part of the monitor is a bit blurry. Just enough to be irritating. The bigger the monitor, the more distance difference there is between the closest pixel to my eye and the furthest. That degrades quality. But I can see every pixel on an oculus rift display perfectly. So, at least for me, such an environment can actually be higher quality than reality (or at least compared to real displays).<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/dextype-virtual-keyboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/dextype-virtual-keyboard/</a>",1426004528

You&#x27;re either breaking terms of service or, in some cases, the law by using them. The content you consume is free in exchange for showing you ads. By only consuming without seeing the ads, you&#x27;re effectively stealing directly from the publishers (site owners). I&#x27;ll just leave it at that, however you deal with this morally and personally is up to you.<p>The ad networks do care about this since it&#x27;s still lost revenue, but our effect is minimized because we often have much bigger reach than just a few sites and can still serve plenty of ads across the entire web. There is an arms race and the big companies just pay to play. Remember the adblock plugins are usually made by for-profit corporations who will grant exceptions for cash so take from that what you will.<p>You can run your own plugins or filter lists but there are not that many of you who do this to matter much. So yes, we do keep an eye on adblock usage but it&#x27;s still small enough for us to just not put too much effort on it now. Also there are plenty of companies with some tech to defeat adblockers so that will happen if the industry does decide to focus on it.<p>As for privacy, I have to ask first, what are you trying to accomplish? Remember you can either have accurate ads best fit for you or have complete privacy. We can&#x27;t show you stuff that&#x27;s relevant without tracking, that&#x27;s just reality. I can&#x27;t reveal too much but networks usually start tracking with cookies and some more advanced methods by themselves but as they get bigger, we outsource a lot of the tracking to 3rd party companies who are very good at this. There are lots of browser and device fingerprinting technologies and other information that you give off just to visit and render a site that we can use. Even the internet carriers themselves participate in this and you can&#x27;t really hide from them since most people just have 1 connection. Proxy services will help but again you&#x27;re sacrificing a lot of convenience and speed for what? To stick it to us? Unless you&#x27;re running adblockers, we&#x27;ll just end up serving you generic ads anyway and still tracking as best we can.<p>I think there&#x27;s a massive misconception on what exactly you&#x27;re protecting yourself from. Most user profiles are removed after 15-30-60 days as it becomes stale. We don&#x27;t collect personally identifying information (but facebook does), we don&#x27;t track searches (but google does), and it&#x27;s all just anonymized identifiers. Beyond that, we can always just ask the big data collecting agencies for more information to make a decision without actually collecting/storing anything ourselves (stuff like purchase histories) so you&#x27;re not giving up much there either. I do understand the battle for privacy but in lots of situations, the issues are overblown if you want my honest opinion.",1426004262

As I grew both as a person and artist, I took great interest in his pushback against commercialism, and later, his efforts with the Sunday comics. There was a fighting spirit, a man of principle, who leveraged his success in ways that may seem trivial or needlessly difficult to regular business people, but are fundamental in the creative sphere where exploiting an artist&#x27;s work for maximum profit is typically the norm. For these aspects of his career, I&#x27;m eternally grateful.<p>Here&#x27;s the part where people look at me like I&#x27;m just being a jerk: After reading as much of his interviews, panel contributions and commencement speeches as possible, I discovered a profoundly selfish and hypocritical man. Time and again, he spoke highly of the importance of art, of doing art as much as possible, and how important his particular art, that of comics, was to the overall conversation about life. What bothers me the most is that once he obtained financial stability and security that, roughly speaking, only 1% of artists in any genre can hope to obtain, he straight up quit. He had, for lack of a better term, the world as his audience to continue putting out material on his own terms, and he did nothing. Nothing.<p>To me, I find that immensely conflicting. I love Calvin and Hobbes and always will. I embrace many of the lessons that Bill Watterson&#x27;s career gave me about success, commercialism, and integrity. All that noted, I will never hesitate to claim that a real artist doesn&#x27;t just up and quit and walk away because they can afford to. A real artist can never afford to quit because it&#x27;s what they do, and art without an audience is simply selfish folly.<p>Will I try to get my hands on this interview? Of course.

Especially with more parallelizable workloads being pushed to GPUs for processing, it&#x27;s interesting to see where the distribution of CPU/GPU focused tasks goes.<p>Of particular note in the world of data analytics, there are some exciting things on the horizon for using GPU cores to accelerate database workloads[0][1]. Of particular interest here is removing the communication overhead between CPU and GPU and avoiding the memory translations necessary to move between GPU VRAM to system RAM.<p>AMD&#x27;s success in the iGPU market and their HSA design (along with supporting APIs) could be enough to win AMD some market share.<p>[0]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5595738"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5595738</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8787414"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8787414</a>",1426003365

And the problem lies squarely with you and me.<p>Try this experiment:  Ask a group of 5-10 people around you to raise their hands if they&#x27;ve been pissed off at any branch or level of their government.  Then ask them to keep their hands up if they&#x27;ve contacted their representatives about that issue.  Finally, ask them if the method of contact they used was the phone or written (not email) letter.<p>I&#x27;ll bet dollars to donuts that not a single hand will be in the air.<p>You and I are the problem because we don&#x27;t hold our representatives accountable.  We really only pay attention (and marginal attention at that) during election time by buying into the campaign bullshit.  At best we sign an online petition but the politicians barely care about that.  They know that its easy even for the most apathetic to click a button.  Sure, in cases like net neutrality it can get their attention but I&#x27;ll submit that what <i>really</i> got their attention was the number of phone calls they were getting.<p>Yes, <i>I</i> specifically am to blame because <i>I</i> haven&#x27;t called or written my representatives.  That&#x27;s going to stop.  We need to be on the horn with these people frequently.  Weekly.  When they&#x27;re in town we need to be in their faces.  They said, &quot;If you see something, say something.&quot;  Well, I see corruption and I&#x27;m going to point right at them and tell them.  Will you join me?<p>EDIT: I should add that we need to be contacting them when we approve of the work they&#x27;re doing.  They need data.  Most of the feedback they receive is negative (and for good reason) but without positive feedback they&#x27;re left searching and unfortunately the guys who claim to have the answers are the lobbyists.  But remember, there are around 15,000 lobbyists in Washington D.C. but 131,144,000 voters voted in the 2012 Presidential election.  I like our chances, if only we get involved.",1426003325

They&#x27;re pushing the boundaries of portability on a machine with a full sized keyboard. The port decision is clearly the future, but as with the original MBA, the market isn&#x27;t quite ready to make the leap re: the tradeoffs. It&#x27;s incredibly thin, light, and amazing looking machine with no compromises where it truly matters most, -the keyboard and the screen. The basic premise is in place. It feels to me like the Air will yield to this once the difference in value from the remaining tradeoffs (battery life, price, etc) shrinks a bit.",1426003245

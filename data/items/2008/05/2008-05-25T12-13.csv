199493,story,,,14,46,mcfly,"Ask YC: What to do with repetitive strain injury problems?",,"Hi everybody,<p>I have developed RSI problems (repetitive strain injury) in my lower left arm. At first, it only occurred after playing the guitar. I have since stopped doing that (1 year ago already). But now, my wrist/lower arm hurts even when I am only programming and it's getting a real problem for me. After all, I earn my living as a programmer. I was wondering:<p>Has anybody else had these problems? What did you do to get better? Was there a ""magic trick"" that worked for you? Is there a special keyboard you can recommend? Also, do you have experience with some kind of speech recognition software that you can recommend? Is it even possible to use speech recognition with Eclipse, for example?",1211719993

The technology is really amazing, especially when used to record animations. They also had other cool stuff, like a 3D leaves/flowers/trees design tool.",1211719148

199482,comment,198732,199016,0,0,DougBTX,,,"The OECD stats look quite interesting. They break things down into Type A[1] and Type B[2] programs. Superficially, Type A are 3+ year courses, Type B are 2+ year courses. Results for the UK and US are here[3][xls]. Executive summary: for the 3-4 year Type A graduates, in the UK, 97% graduate. The OECD average is 67%. This report also has data for the US.<p>For actual numbers of people in the UK with degrees, there's this page[4] from the National Statistics. For people of Working Age, 18 to 60-ish, in the UK, 16% have degrees, and another 8.5% have ""Higher education qualifications"". 15% have no qualifications. It would be handy to have data for the 25-35 age range, since not many 18 year olds have degrees.<p>[1] Type A: <a href=""http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5440</a><p>[2] Type B: <a href=""http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=544"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=544</a><p>[3] World Stats: <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/15/39245059.xls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/15/39245059.xls</a><p>[4] UK Degree Stats: <a href=""http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/Product.asp?vlnk=10446"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/Product.asp?vlnk=10446</a>",1211717087

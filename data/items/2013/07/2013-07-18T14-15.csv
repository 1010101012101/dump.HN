6064054,comment,6055452,6062562,1,0,retroafroman,,,"Those aren&#x27;t facts. That is all speculation from 2 years ago. There is one fact in that article, the fact that there are now 19,000 armed security contractors. This number is much, much lower than the amount of troops in the country. There are a lot of contractors, but those are contract workers, not PMC employees. This is a huge difference than the point you&#x27;re trying to make. Laundry workers and cooks don&#x27;t wage war for the government.",1374159582

You&#x27;re just sitting on a domain until someone comes along who meets your criteria (project traction and some cash), instead of another&#x27;s criteria (big bucks, and no cares about how it will be used).<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reasonable way to vet people who want to buy a domain.

Then I remember that any system will inevitably result in mistakes, Congresswill respond to those mistakes with overbroad rules that restrict the planner, and we&#x27;ll end up in an even worse situation.<p>Well, I don&#x27;t know.  The recent FDA drug quality crackdown has probably saved a few lives at the cost of hundreds dieing from drug shortages. The problem is that the former number is much more squarely within the FDA&#x27;s regulatory perview thant he later, giving them equal weight. Maybe if we had an organization equally responsible for both numbers we&#x27;d see better outcomes.<p>ut then again, any beaurocratic boundaries will be unnatural at times, and you have to divide up departments somehow.  I&#x27;m not sure any alternative organization wouldn&#x27;t result in equally perverse outcomes.<p>And on the gripping hand, regulators in Europe have somehow managed to avoid this problem entirely, so we should probably just copy what they&#x27;re doing.

He had to be explaining himself from using word &quot;kill&quot; and that it wasnt what he was trying to say. Damn, when I come to think about how much of a frog in boiling water the USA become, to be okay with some unmanned aircrafts flying over foreign soil and dropping bombs in an attempt to kill people, it gives me goose bombs!<p>At the end of the day, the true reason why I can still sleep well is that fact that like Rome Empire, the USA Empire will fall too.

That&#x27;s because the data are not from a random sample of the relevant population. One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that &quot;voluntary response data are worthless&quot; to go along with the phrase &quot;correlation does not imply causation.&quot; Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>-----Original Message----- From: Paul Velleman [SMTPfv2@cornell.edu] Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 1998 5:10 PM To: apstat-l@etc.bc.ca; Kim Robinson Cc: mmbalach@mtu.edu Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are worthless. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest &quot;poll&quot;. All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can&#x27;t be &quot;used only as a description&quot; because they describe nothing but themselves.<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=3...</a><p>For more on the distinction between statistics and mathematics, see &quot;Advice to Mathematics Teachers on Evaluating Introductory Statistics Textbooks&quot;<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and &quot;The Introductory Statistics Course: A Ptolemaic Curriculum?&quot;<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>I think Professor Velleman promotes &quot;Voluntary response data are worthless&quot; as a slogan for the same reason an earlier generation of statisticians taught their students the slogan &quot;correlation does not imply causation.&quot; That&#x27;s because common human cognitive errors run strongly in one direction on each issue, so the slogan has to take the cognitive error head-on. Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn&#x27;t tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world. The Literary Digest poll<p><a href=""http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf</a><p>is a spectacular historical example of a voluntary response poll with a HUGE sample size and high response rate that didn&#x27;t give a correct picture of reality at all.<p>When I have brought up this issue before, some other HNers have replied that there are some statistical tools for correcting for response-bias effects, IF one can obtain a simple random sample of the population of interest and evaluate what kinds of people respond. But we can&#x27;t do that here on HN.<p>Another reply I frequently see when I bring up this issue is that the public relies on voluntary response data all the time to make conclusions about reality. To that I refer careful readers to what Professor Velleman is quoted as saying above (the general public often believes statements that are baloney) and to what Google&#x27;s director of research, Peter Norvig, says about research conducted with better data,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that even good data (and Norvig would not generally characterize voluntary response data as good data) can lead to wrong conclusions if there isn&#x27;t careful thinking behind a study design. Again, human beings have strong predilections to believe certain kinds of wrong data and wrong conclusions. We are not neutral evaluators of data and conclusions, but have predispositions (cognitive illusions) that lead to making mistakes without careful training and thought.<p>Another frequently seen reply is that sometimes a &quot;convenience sample&quot; (this is a common term among statisticians for a sample that can&#x27;t be counted on to be a random sample) of a population offers just that, convenience, and should not be rejected on that basis alone. But the most thoughtful version of that frequent reply I have previously seen in online discussion did correctly point out that if we know from the get-go that the sample was not done statistically correctly, then even if we are confident (enough) that HN participants are young, we wouldn&#x27;t want to extrapolate from that to conclude that the users of any technology site are young, or that users of the Internet as a whole are young.<p>On my part, I wildly guess that most HNers are younger than I am in part because this kind of poll recurs often on HN. Other preoccupations of younger rather than older people make up frequent topics on HN, and I&#x27;ve tried looking for signs that there are large hidden numbers of old participants here without finding many. Similarly, I wildly guess that most Hacker News participants are within six inches (about 21cm) of the median adult male height of the country in which they live, but there are certainly some outliers in the group here.",1374158910

6063982,comment,6062835,6062835,14,0,hackula1,,,"Here are a few of the things I would recommend in no particular order. Most of them are pretty traditional.<p>1. Wear leather shoes. You could dress in rags, but if you are wearing leather shoes, it will make it look like you meant to. Scott Hanselman pointed this out on his This Developer&#x27;s Life podcast a while back.<p>2. Show your github or linkedin profiles, but despite people saying &quot;oh, this is my resume&quot;, no it is not. Quit being cute and spend 20 minutes typing up a real resume. Use one of the templates provided in most word processors. Your resume is not meant to stand out. It is meant to be used as a filter to see if there are any red flags. Think of it like just another piece of paperwork. Include your last 3 jobs (not 1 and definitely not 10), degrees, and a list of technologies you know. Do not include smarmy HR stuff like &quot;Team Player! Great Work Ethic!&quot; Make the resume custom taylored to fit the position you are applying for. Since you are not including everything you have ever done, just focus on the experience you have that is most relevant. Lastly, keep it to one page, with a normal font size.<p>3. Dress to the company +1. If they wear cargo shorts and t shirts, wear shorts with a polo. If they wear jeans and polos, wear jeans with a button down. If they wear kahkis and button downs, wear that plus a tie. If they wear suits... you probably do not want to work there so I would recommend wearing a tuxedo or nothing at all.<p>4. Always remember that you are interviewing them. Take charge of the interview. Ask about the culture and values. Ask the interviewer how they personally feel about X and Y aspects of the business. Ask about stability and/or revenue. If it seems appropriate (feel it out), ask where the person who&#x27;s position you are filling is now and why they left. If there are red flags hiding, this is the question that will often reveal them.<p>6. As far as finding companies goes, pick a list of 10 you like, then email all of them. If they have a position listed, then mention the position, but if not, apply anyway and offer your services. Coders are in demand, and many companies will jump at the chance to interview an enthusiastic person who took some initiative. Pretty much ignore job requirements. They are so often unreliable, that you might as well find out in person. As long as you are fine with the stack, go for it.<p>7. Do not get tunnel vision. This is probably the most important thing. It is like buying a house. Do not fall in love with any one offer. You should never, under any circumstances, be applying for one job at a time. You always want multiple offers so that you can leverage them against each other. Also, if one falls through, it is no big deal. If you were going to apply for one job at a time, you are forced to go with jobs that are almost a sure thing. After all, if it does not work out, you could be out of work for another month or two. If you reach for something out of your comfort zone (something that is essential for growth), you might have a 20% shot of getting each individual job. You do not want this to be a 6 month process, so go for jobs in batches of 5. If you have a 20% chance at each, you will probably land one of them. I have seen many coders fall into the trap of feeling like they are being disloyal for following multiple leads at once. This is complete BS. Companies are interviewing as many people as they can, so do the same. You do not even work for them yet, so loyalty really should not factor in.",1374158880

If you explain your thought process, not only does that give me more to grade you on, but it also allows me to guide you.

(Its not just an issue of calling classes different names, it divides up functionality differently than class-based OO systems -- packages are in a sense like classes [they are the closest equivalent to the function of classes as containers of static methods], structs are a bit like classes [in the role of containing members, and in that anonymous embedding approximates inheritance], every type is a bit like classes [in that any type can have methods attached to it, so long as they are attached in the same package as the type is defined]; but all these things are also unlike classes in various ways, too.)",1374157187

Right = &quot;Reduced a long running SQL call from 8 hours to 20 minutes&quot;<p>- Also try to avoid &quot;fuzzy&quot; statements on your resume. Make your accomplishments quantifiable.<p>Wrong = &quot;Rewrote a VB program so that it was a lot faster&quot;. Right = &quot;Rewrote a VB program, reducing average run time from 60 minutes to 15 minutes&quot;<p>- Be prepared to defend any statement on your resume. If you made that program faster, be prepared to explain how and why<p>- Apply for some jobs you don&#x27;t really want before you apply for the ones you DO want. This is because interviewing is an art, and it really helps to &quot;get in the mode&quot; first. If you going to bomb the first few interviews, make them ones you don&#x27;t care about so much.<p>- Turn off your cell phone. Better yet, leave it in the car.<p>- Have a personality. Hiring is still mostly about who &quot;fits&quot; the job. If they like you, half the battle is over. At the same time, don&#x27;t be &quot;chummy&quot; with the interviewer. If you act like you two are best friends and should go out for a beer together, it feels kiss-assy and rarely if ever bodes well for you.<p>- Prepare to answer common questions. Why do want to work here? Why should we hire you? What are you most proud of? What is your weakness? What was a time you had a conflict at work? Almost everyone asks these, and and sucks to answer with some dumb example.<p>- Always try to rephrase the question asked to you before answering it. e.g. &quot;Tell us about your SQL experience&quot; - you reply, &quot;So you want to know what kind of SQL projects I&#x27;ve worked on?&quot; This makes sure you understand what was asked, and it also gives you a moment to think.<p>- If you don&#x27;t know, say you don&#x27;t know<p>- Have examples of your work. Code snippets are great, screenshots of UI&#x27;s you&#x27;ve worked on, etc. When I bomb their pop-quiz (and I always bomb their pop-quiz, I suck at testing) it really helps to tell them that you can show them code from your daily job that better represents you on a daily basis.<p>- Never talk badly about other jobs, even if they were awful. Try to have a reason for switching jobs (e.g. They were a great place to work, but there was really no chance for job advancement) as opposed to &quot;That was a soul sucking job and they can kiss my ass&quot;<p>- Understand that most people performing tech interviews have ZERO training in doing so.

For hardware, there initially were only the bootup systems and hotplug was added haphazardly a piece at a time, and it <i>never</i> really worked properly in all corner cases. Non non-systemd systems, it still doesn&#x27;t.<p>A lot of the justification of systemd is to unify the bootup and runtime systems, so that there is only one, and there should be no difference to a daemon or a driver if it&#x27;s pulled up during bootup or when it&#x27;s plugged in or by the user from console. This unification makes the system simpler, saner, and much more robust. However, it means that there has to be large-scale changes in system architecture. One of those changes was that logging interfaces need to be available before init forks the first time, and among other things, before filesystems.

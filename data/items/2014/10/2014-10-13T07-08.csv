In my case, digging slightly into Angular&#x27;s internals for workarounds was relatively successful.<p>An example is Angular&#x27;s treatment of HTML forms and input elements, w.r.t. things that you&#x27;d expect, such as name / id interpolation (namely: Angular doesn&#x27;t interpolate dynamic form names as you&#x27;d expect - [1] and [2]).  In cases like this, digging into the internals to resolve the initial surprise and later solve the problem was slightly frustrating.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1404"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1404</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/Thinkscape/23RPt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/Thinkscape/23RPt/</a>",1413187194

8447852,comment,8446575,8447173,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> How often do entities like universities or a Paul Allen type company sue for patent royalties? (This isn&#x27;t to discount your comment in any way. I&#x27;m just genuinely curious whether such entities derive substantial revenue from enforcing patent rights, and whether trolls account for >95% of the revenue from patents.)<p>Part of the reason revenue is skewed toward patent trolls is the way they litigate. In most legitimate negotiations the inventor shows the patented invention to the prospective licensee who then decides whether the amount required to license the patent is worth it for including that feature in their product. If the patent holder is asking too much then the prospective licensee can walk away and pay nothing by just not adding that feature to their product. In this situation there is hardly ever any need for litigation since it would only occur if the company consciously chose to use the technology without licensing it.<p>By contrast, patent trolls almost always knock on the doors of companies that are already allegedly infringing their alleged patents. In that case the practicing entity has no option to walk away because they can be sued for past infringement even if they change their product immediately and will incur significant legal expenses even if they win in court. Furthermore, juries have the unfortunate tendency to vastly overestimate the market value of many patents, and now the defendant has to negotiate against a possible jury award rather than the actual market value of not being able to use the technology.<p>This all adds up to mean that the trolling behavior of filing a lawsuit against someone already allegedly infringing has a much larger revenue potential than the honest behavior of offering to license a new technology to a company that isn&#x27;t already using it. It also means that the trolls make up a disproportionately large percentage of actual litigation.",1413186571

I hate saying I&#x27;m a Rails programmer, Django programmer, Python programmer, C# programmer, or in general X programmer. First of all because anyone who says they&#x27;re an X programmer is usually terrible and second because it is not an accurate description.<p>Programmers solve problems with computers and computing devices. The language or framework that is used is completely irrelevant. Well, it&#x27;s not completely irrelevant but it is damn near close. If you&#x27;re not a good problem solver then no framework or programming language can save you. So really companies should be hiring generalist problem solvers and then teaching them to program if necessary. The problem is that most people don&#x27;t hold this viewpoint and instead look for programmers that have been doing .NET or Enterprise Java programming for X years and then looking around and wondering why they can&#x27;t find anyone.

There&#x27;s no reason to think that certain kinds of content wouldn&#x27;t be cached at various points in the mesh, making the total traffic to any particular server lower still.<p>A realistic scenario for a datacenter is that 50-100 people split the cost of having 10 1+gbps links to the network, hitting it at multiple points well spread in the network. The inside of the data center would do some routing to handle the load balancing. I expect the total cost of that would be about $35k to set up, but splitting it between that many people, each person is paying (on average, for 50 to 100 people) between $350 and $700 - well within a reasonable amount for a coop to set up a datacenter. Further, $35k is a small enough price tag that it would be acceptable for a business (or a couple businesses) to share such a datacenter themselves, if there were a particular incentive for them to operate as part of a community mesh, rather than with the current internet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-AF24-Airfiber-Wireless-Complete/dp/B00A51ZOQ4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-AF24-Airfiber-Wireless-Comple...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-AF-5-airFiber-5GHz-Wireless/dp/B00JID5EQU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-AF-5-airFiber-5GHz-Wireless/d...</a>",1413185596

I have no (proper) proof however.<p>Ultimately anything could be infinitely parallelized, by brute-forcing the answer itself. If we put the answer safely out of reach for brue forcing, then all that remains is a number of methods of actually calculating it. Those methods can either be arduous but applicable by everyone or fast but requiring some pre-known secret.<p>For a puzzle that could be solvable by more than one ardous method, it is to be expected that ultimately everyone would be using the fastest one of those - i.e. the author and the public alike, since the methods would be applicable by everyone.<p>For a puzzle that would be solvable by a fast method requiring some secret, the solution would always be brute-forcable on that secret, and thus have a wide timesrange in which it could be solved, depending on the level of parallelism.<p>The only way out I see here is to construct a puzzle with more than one arduous method - one of them obviously faster than the other, but only publish one of the methods and use the other one yourself to calculate the time-locked data. This may or may not be possible - but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something that can be automated, since it requires creative input, considering how a new kind of puzzle would need to be created for every new piece (or at least every new author) of time-locked data, since otherwise the less-arduous methods would become public knowledge too.

The question is what tradeoffs do the languages make for the humans in the loop.<p>Lisp and Java make different tradeoffs there, and C makes yet another set of tradeoffs. And which languages we use is more often dependant on historical accidents than technical excellence (like most human languages) see JS as an example.<p>I believe dynamic languages are better for small teams and short project life times. I believe automatic memory management by default languages are better for the vast majority of projects than manual memory management options.
I think a written language like Traditional Chinese (Java) is better for running an empire than one like Latin (Lisp). But a more modern idea like Hangul (Clojure?) might do even better.<p>In the end to get the best CPU performance one needs to know the CPU and architecture as well as an ability to think in bits.

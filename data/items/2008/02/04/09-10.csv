109043,comment,106398,107318,0,0,microdan,,,"This reminds me of how ""macros"" work in Factor, in a way. You don't avoid manually creating the s-expression (though Scheme and Dylan have a nice mechanism for that), but there is a finer line between macros and regular functions. A macro is a function which takes a bunch of arguments and returns another function which takes no arguments and does the action of the macro. Basically, it's constant-folded at compiletime if possible. The runtime definition is memoized. For Factor's syntax, this kind of macro is practical for everything but new definition syntax and datastructure literals (neither of which this idea would work really well on, and which there is a different mechanism for). In general, a macro operates just like other words and can be quoted and executed like them.",1202117806
109042,comment,108861,108861,0,0,benl,,,"This argument doesn't refute anything.  All it demonstrates is that succinctness is not the only thing that enables a language to be powerful.  I'm not sure anyone has ever made that claim.<p>The fact that there are other things, such as sensible syntax, that can affect a language's power should come as a surprise to no-one.",1202117387

Just try not to pay through the nose to do it... be careful with those lawyers.<p>Just don't worry about stepping on the other guy's patents. They are just paper really.<p>And as we know in this economy there is a lot of phony paper out there that people just want to call valuable/meaningful.",1202117245

109039,comment,108794,108955,0,0,halo,,,"I'm not against patents per se (they're a necessary evil, I believe that shortening their length and/or adding a forced licensing clause could improve them), but the problem is that software patents too often do the opposite than what they're intended - stifling innovation in a rapidly evolving market - and the patent system is currently too-often used on things that are likely to be reinvented and become popular independently rather than the actual purpose which is share knowledge with the world in exchange for a temporary monopoly on your invention.",1202116449

109036,comment,108965,108965,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Harvard's CS department seems pretty decent (dedicated, interesting students; a variety of challenging courses; etc) to me, though as a non-CS-concentrator myself, I'm probably not the best one for advice. :)  Also, I'm not sure whether you'll find much in the way of Ajax or similar technologies, but I'm far from convinced that you really want to take courses in that sort of thing.  I was somewhat unimpressed with the intro theory course--would have been better to walk down the street and take Sipser's course at MIT.<p>As you mentioned, one big thing to consider is what you are interested in besides CS, what other types of students you want to hang out with, etc.  College, at least at good American schools, is generally less about preparation for a career, and more about personal growth and exploration.<p>Finally, I imagine Stanford has somewhat better weather than Boston. :)",1202116001

""Microsoft"" is not a brand I associate with ""focus on building great products"".  I guess that's a bit of a cheap shot, and at one point in time, they certainly outcompeted everyone else to win what would go on to become their monopoly, but still, I just don't see anyone focusing much on anything with two big icebergs crashing into one another, let alone 'great products' free from political interference.",1202115632

209501,comment,208978,209141,0,0,mpk,,,"Yup, here's me disagreeing.<p>I do interviews on occasion and I usually ask for some source on the whiteboard. Generally I only do that with people interviewing for junior positions, though.<p>I usually ask for a quick implementation of the fibonacci algo in their favorite language. I also tell them that sloppy is OK - so brace placements, etc are not relevant.<p>I hardly think it's too much to ask for a candidate to implement a simple, standard algo <i>in their language of choice</i> on paper/whiteboard.<p>PHP programmers tend to do very poorly in this area, unless they are programmers who also do PHP. The problem to me seems to be that the PHP environment doesn't encourage experimentation with algorithms, data structures and low-level optimization. Add to that the more-or-less haphazard manner in which most PHP code is organized and you've got a scripter who'll freeze when asked to do a piece of mathematics on paper in their language. Also, most PHP programmers tend to be framework-users. And while using frameworks is good, using frameworks without automating elements of your problem domain (by creating your own little framework-on-a-framework) is generally bad because you end up repeating yourself a lot.<p>PHP is not a bad language, but it's a very, very bad language to have as your sole programming experience.",1212623824

The only bits of info I found were that busing students from one neighborhood to the next didn't have much effect either way.<p>The problem of selection bias is of course going to be very present as always.  One of the toughest issues with public policy is that there's rarely data up to a scientific standard of proof.  It's possible that the amount of money spent on an education has nil effect.  One simple counterargument is this:  you can't learn about computers if you don't have them.<p>1)""Giving up""
You're using a slippery slope argument.  I think a minimum wage job with essentially no opportunity for advancement at 14, is too early to ""give up.""  That's the example that I responded to.<p>This is a place where we have to set a number -- it's currently at 16.  This is a fairly subjective call, as there are a thousand different concerns that could reasonably move it one way or the other.<p>2)Value of an education
A decently educated populace has great value, to me.  I'm willing to pay for it.  On the contrary, a bad education is not worth all that much.  I believe the solution to bad education is to make it better, not to get rid of it forever.<p>3)Democracy
How about basics like what the supreme court is and how to locate Iraq on a map?  If you want to tell people about the founders, it helps if they know who the founders were and what the constitution is.  No one is going to vote for your viewpoint if they don't even know what it is you're talking about.<p>We seem to disagree about some basic matters, so trying to argue about a high-level issue like education funding and the drop-out age is probably fairly futile.",1212622762

Code that loaded programs, provided low-level I/O services (Bray bags on the primitiveness of OS services, but they're much better than talking to h/w devices directly), helped with memory management, and so on.<p>The web doesn't really have hardware, but it definitely needs abstractions and utility code.

209471,comment,209191,209191,0,0,jmatt,,,"I think some background is in order so you know my perspective.<p>I spent 3 summer months traveling to the western continental US in 2000. I've been to every state west of the Mississippi. Since 2000, I've lived in Arizona and traveled extensively in Arizona, New Mexico and California. I enjoy hiking, skiing, mountain biking and visiting big cities and national parks.<p>I'd recommend staying in extended stay hotels and getting as much travel in as possible over picking up apartments.<p>Let's assume you find your way to Jackson WY. A cool small town in NW Wyoming. I'd visit Grand Teton and Yellowstone NP then head through Missoula, Montana to Coeur D'Alene / Spokane. Then head toward Seattle (or possibly the Columbia River valley to Portland). This is probably a week or two if you are working on and off.<p>I'd recommend Vancouver and Seattle as a base for the next week or two. I'd goto Victoria from Vancouver. I'd head to Olympic NP and Mt Rainier from Seattle. Mixing off days in downtown Seattle and/or Vancouver.<p>I'd head south to Portland and set up base here for another week or two. I'd hit up Mt Hood for some skiing in late summer (just fun because you can). And I'd cruise the Oregon coast. There are a ton of really cool cities on the coast. Portland has great breweries that should not be missed.<p>Next I'd head south toward San Francisco. Consider visiting Redwood NP. It's quite an excursion. If you do you'll probably want to take the 101 south. Even though this is a scenic drive it can be a bit crazy after six or eight hours of driving crazy coastal roads. If you are into easy going hippy / wine culture then this is a must. Since you'll pass through Eureka, Sonoma, Santa Rosa, Napa, etc.<p>I've only visited San Fransisco and San Jose a few times. This is a good place to set up a base. I'm assuming there will already be plenty of advice on visiting this area. There are definitely plenty of tourist areas that can be taken in depending on your interests. Yosemite NP and Lake Tahoe and Napa are a must if you are in the San Fransisco area.<p>I've driven from San Fransisco to LA a number of times and prefer the mountain drive. Versus the coast drive. Both are superior to just taking the 5.<p>The mountains: Yosemite and Kings Canyon and Sequoia NP. Farm land in between mountains. Definitely worth seeing the ""rest"" of California. Also great if you love the mountains and forest to the coast.<p>The coast: Monterey, Pebble Beach, San Luis Obispo. Golf courses, wineries and marinas. Definitely good if you have a significant other and a lot of cash. If you can afford it and aren't into mountains and giant trees this is the way to go.<p>Other than the beach cities I'd skip most of LA. With the exception of specific things you are interested in. Still you'll have to drive EVERYWHERE and it's huge. Maybe hook up with a friend there and get the tour that way.<p>Set up base in San Diego and Long Beach. The area is really cool. I've only visited as a tourist but it's definitely a lot of fun. You'll get the socal feel without having to spend too much time in LA.<p>I'm a big rock climber so I'd recommend Joshua Tree NP on the way out of California. But if you insist on some gambling then go through the Mojave / Death Valley to Las Vegas. I'd spend less time in LV and hit up a nicer hotel while there. That is just me personally. If you are in LV in the middle of the summer you should shop for deals beforehand because you'll be able to get some insane room rates. I've stayed in a huge 1200 sq ft suite for 150 a night in July and August. Always ask when you check in if there are any available upgrades.<p>Then I'd head to Zion NP, Bryce NP and end in the Grand Canyon NP. You could loop as far out as Moab and back to the Grand Canyon. I don't know how best to visit this area with a single base. This is all time dependent. I would recommend doing the south west late because Monsoons will have arrived. It will be somewhere between insanely hot and pleasant. But in May-July you'll just end up with the insanely hot bit. Seeing the monsoons tear across the SW is really awesome too. So with some lucky you'll catch some impressive storms.<p>If you have time and are down with the desert I would hit Tucson. Saguaros can not be found anywhere else in the world (just southern AZ and nothern MX). It's a laid back and cool town and where I currently live. It's one of those ""big"" small towns.<p>From there head to Santa Fe and on to Denver. If you are a bit insane and have the time I'd head through Durango and take the 550 up and around through the Rockies. If you are in a rush take 25 all the way through. The Great Sand Dunes NP is bizarre and just off of 25. It's a good place to stop if you have time and weather dependent. I personally prefer the ski areas on the western side of the Rockies. The cities and ski areas have a lot more character.<p>Have a great trip!",1212621542
209470,comment,208736,209369,0,0,william-newman,,,"""Why choose any examples at all? The only point of the comparisons is to make an emotional argument, which has no foundations in logic whatsoever.""<p>The only point? I think not.<p>One other point which Crichton makes explicitly is ""The past history of human belief is a cautionary tale."" Bad science can be very expensive, people mouthing bad science can do extremely nasty things in its name. I think he hammers on this point too much in the essay. It seems to me that most people are already predisposed to believe that policies based in bad science can be really bad: bandwidth is cheap, but why waste it on flogging this dead horse when it could be better used for porn about flogging dead horses? I also think bringing in Lysenkoism is a bad idea because even though it is a valid illustration of bad science being expensive, it comes with the non-parallel of being enforced by world-class murderous repression of dissent, which is too much of a distraction. But whether or not my criticisms are valid, I think it's clearly a point.<p>Another point which I don't think Crichton makes explicitly, but which seems to motivate various of his examples, is illustrating that a form of argument could be used to justify horrid and stupid eugenic claims and policies. That's both a vivid way of making the point that that form of argument is logically invalid style, and a way of demonstrating that that form of argument dangerous in political practice, and shouldn't be taken lightly.<p>Look at martythemaniak's post...<p>""I really don't have the ego to claim I magically know better than thousands of scientists and decades of research, ..."" Adjust that for the smaller 1920 scientific population, s/thousands/hundreds/ perhaps, and you have a right-thinking person wisely avoiding being branded as a eugenics denier.<p>AGW advocates like martythemaniak delight in comparing themselves to Darwinists and their critics to creationists. Very well, then: why stoop to use arguments which were used to defend Sanger? Think of valid arguments like the ones which worked to defend Darwin but not Sanger, and use them in preference to flaky arguments which can be used to defend any old garbage. Especially, Darwin and his followers found all sorts of extensive patterns of species and population which, to the best of my knowledge, defy explanation any other way. So why not use arguments like that? They can be extremely convincing.<p>bad example 2: ""the fact that CO2 Levels are higher today than anytime in the last 800000 years, or the fact of the 40% increase since the 1800s, my conclusion is pretty obvious."" s/CO2/non-Aryan/, s/the last 800000 years/our nation's history/.<p>Unfortunately, banging on one superficial correlation and declaring victory is a classic pro-Sanger style of argument, not the kind of characteristically pro-Darwin argument that I was referring to. It might seem like good clean fun if you are a true believer and haven't thought about it, but think about it now. Or, if you still don't realize how dysfunctional it is, start by imagining trying to dissuade someone who thinks he has found revealed inconvenient truth in ""all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really.""<p>After that, feel free to copy the Darwinists by blasting away with all those independent detailed observed patterns which match AGW. Or pick some other style of argument which worked for Darwin and not for Sanger, and use that.<p>Or, alternatively, perhaps no such arguments exist, and instead the comparison to Darwinists is self-flattery on such a cosmic scale that AGW does have enormous explanatory power --- in that the gravitational effect of the vast self-flattery cloud explains what the cosmologists call ""dark matter"". That's roughly my opinion: possibly the Gore/IPCC version of AGW (only very small non-CO2-driven global climate fluctuations, and large positive feedback in climate response to CO2) is correct, but certainly it is not a glaringly obvious truth about the world like Darwin's natural selection. Instead it's like the Philips Curve question I wrote about elsewhere: the answer should become clearer over time, and you can make valid arguments now about what it will turn out to be, but it's not a routine matter to convince an honest skeptic by direct appeals to observation. Darwinists could sample a near-endless supply of independent ecosystems to determine whether a pattern holds or not, and they delighted in charging into the details. AGWists start with a naturally data-poor problem like the Philips Curve arguers, and then many of them make it poorer by retreating from the details, refusing to commit themselves to anything sharper than decadal averages over the entire globe.",1212621279

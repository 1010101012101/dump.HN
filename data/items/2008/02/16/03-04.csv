A good concept with poor presentation will be dismissed, and in the case of a language like Arc, presentation could also be defined to include ""number of features, immediate utility, etc.""<p>I know my reaction was similar to the crowd, but even so I recognize that it's the wrong thing to look for. If Arc's initial release state could be summed up as ""Lisp with some cleaned-up and rearranged features,"" then it's really not that different from say, Digital Mars D, which is best described as ""C++ with some cleaned-up and rearranged features."" The difference is, D has a massive compiler backing it, and its scope is unlikely to change. Arc's minimal implementation substance only makes it easier to change tack midway.<p>I've only gradually learned to restrain my sense of ego and take a similarly minimal approach with my own projects(indie games) - my newest process is to always start the final implementation with a text console interface. Besides encouraging better architecture in preparing for a later graphical interface, it's easier to debug the key elements this way than to have ""stuff moving on the screen"" at 30 or 60FPS and get frustrated figuring out which of those frames is the one where you're getting an error, let alone what routine is causing the problem.",1203133957

Sun Grid is for batch jobs, which I think is inherently less visible, less flexible, and less cool than the Web 2.0 serving that people use EC2 for. Even if people were using Sun Grid you might never know about it. AFAIK Sun Grid is 5X the price of EC2, so even for batch jobs I don't know why anyone would use it.<p>Coincidentally, The Register just posted a story about a Sun project that could be quite competitive with EC2: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/15/caroline_sun_amazon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/15/caroline_sun_amazon/</a>\n(I have to wonder if this was a submarine job timed to coincide with the S3 outage.)",1203133649

116833,comment,116663,116663,0,0,dejb,,,"I think this article is entirely wrong. Trying to create another silicon valley is a bad idea full stop. The way to compete as a startup or a tech company is to utilize whatever natural advantages your location has. Be prepared to communicate remotely with other entities that are far away. I actually believe in the internet as a communication medium - that business can be effectively conducted outside of meatspace.<p>Also startups outside of SV will have to start actively discriminating against companies in SV in the same way that some companies from SV do to them. Apart from the collective benefits for non-SV'ers, I believe there is a good individual reason for doing this - information sharing.<p>Part of SV's advantage must be the 'informal flow of information' that can occur over a few beers. I'm sure a lot of things that one would be hesitant to permanently record are communicated. So it seems more likely that information shared with a SV company is more likely to find its way to competitor than with a non-SV company. Additionally the movement of employees between companies is another means for this 'information sharing' to occur.<p>Please don't get me wrong. I don't have anything against SV or companies in it. There very well may be a disadvantage for no-SV companies. But compared to the operational and cost disadvantages of moving to SV these are small. Or to put it another way -'We must fight where we stand. We have no other choice'.",1203132882

This field is pretty experimental but someone who could come up with the magic battery that charges in 5 minutes would probably have a valuable system on their hands.<p>Another angle would be to have cars that run on batteries that can be swapped out at gas stations as needed. There are a bunch of issues that need to be considered for this approach but it's still a neat idea.",1203132811

There were both trying to do the same thing - sort customer orders in product sequence on the executive dashboard.  300 records - what was the problem?<p>2 things: 1) It was an internal bubble sort I had written years ago.  2) They both selected a year's worth of data.<p>Doh!

Every PoS app on Windows and OSX has its own update process, which mostly is just downloading and running the new setup binary.<p>This happens even with software where you would think the manufacturer is aware of this kind of problem. 1Password downloaded updates over HTTP for a long time, then switched to HTTPS and failed to check certificates. When they finally started to check if binaries are signed (Windows provides for that), they didn&#x27;t change keys so you could downgrade to a previous version that didn&#x27;t. That is just one application.",1396742387

So the first developer has an inflated ego, and the second doesn&#x27;t, and people standing on the side who don&#x27;t have a clue which is which.  In this case, we have one who thinks it&#x27;s reasonable for the debug flag to bring down the system, and the other is a sane reasonable person who&#x27;s not going to tolerate this crash-the-planet type behavior any more.",1396742314

Have you considered asking your boss why he/she left?

At the top everything is pretty abstract, and there&#x27;s more freedom to do conceptually interesting things (for example we were doing quite a bit of adaptive control type stuff, which would have been a nightmare to write with lower-level languages).<p>In the middle, however, it seemed to me to be largely just a complicated network of interacting conventions. Those systems are neither firmly grounded in &quot;reality&quot;, because they are generally trying to abstract away those details, nor are they &quot;theoretically pure&quot;, because they need to be efficient (though there is a lot of interesting stuff there). What that means is that you simply have to learn and understand all those human-defined conventions to know what you&#x27;re doing, and that makes solving problems at that level more difficult, or perhaps rather it requires much more hard-won expertise (which I never got much of - I just bugged other people until they would help me out!).<p>Obviously, my views are coloured by my personal experience, so make of them what you will.",1396740683

For example, it&#x27;s rare that a coffee shop will go to zero.

I’m not sure they can be classified as entanglement, but the fundamental reason is at least as weird as entanglement and I think they would be also very difficult to simulate.<p>There is also a correction of the law for Ideal gases. It’s more important when the temperature is low and the quantum effects are more visible. Essentially, let’s suppose that you have a lot (~1E23) of identical atoms/molecules in a gas. In some gases the atoms/molecules can’t be in the some quantum state at the same place (fermions) and in other gases they can be (bosons). Moreover, the particles are all identical, so you can’t label them and can’t track them. This causes an “apparent repulsion” in the fermions gasses and an “apparent traction”. It’s not a real force, it’s only a statistical effect that looks like a attraction/repulsion. (It’s a little more complicated because the positions and velocities are not discrete, so “the same place” is more difficult to define.) (I can’t find a link to a direct simple measurement.)

The first paper to introduce lambda calculus in relation to computers was Peter Landin&#x27;s &quot;The mechanical evaluation of expressions&quot; (1964). Its specific goal was to use the lambda calculus to model the facilities of other programming languages in use at the time. Landin continued this investigation with two more papers in the series: &quot;A Correspondence Between ALGOL 60 and Church&#x27;s Lambda-Notation&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Next 700 Programming Languages&quot; (1966). Because of the LC&#x27;s basis in mathematics and logic, it provided a useful way to define the semantics of programming languages. It continued in this role over the next few decades. One of many high points in this evolution was the use of the LC as the basis of Scheme, &quot;An Interpreter for Extended Lambda Calculus&quot;. Among many other contributions, the &quot;Lambda Papers&quot; investigated other models of computation (e.g., actors).<p>So the lambda calculus has been used as a consistent and primitive basis for understanding computation itself and how it is expressed in programming languages. I suppose it is more &quot;equivalent&quot; to Newton&#x27;s 2nd Law than any particular way to solve a problem. It&#x27;s perhaps worth remembering that Principia  used geometry, not what we know of as calculus, to clarify mechanics.",1396740088

The gentleman prognosticator of the mid-1880s could look back at steady progress in the operating speed of railways and similar improvement in steamships throughout the 19th century. He would be aware of the prototyping of various forms of engine that promised to allow carriages to reliably proceed at the pace of trains, and the first frail airships that could manage a fair pace in flight - though by no means the equal of speed by rail.<p>Like our present era, however, the end of the 19th century was a time of very rapid progress and invention in comparison to the past. In such ages trends are broken and exceeded. Thus within twenty years of the first crudely powered and fragile airships, heavier than air flight launched in earnest: a revolutionary change in travel brought on by the blossoming of a completely new branch of applied technology. By the late 1920s, the aircraft of the first airlines consistently flew four to five times as fast as the operating speed of trains in 1880, and new lines of travel could be set up for a fraction of the cost of a railway. Little in the way of incrementalism there: instead a great and sweeping improvement accomplished across a few decades and through the introduction of a completely new approach to the problem.",1396739862

7538820,comment,7538732,7538732,2,0,jeffmould,,,"Congratulations on your win. First off, I am by no means an attorney so... You can probably find some sample contract templates via a Google search. Critical to your success though you will want to make sure that no matter what you cover at least the following: (1) timeline to completion; (2) payment terms as far as milestones and when payment is to be made and what happens if payment is not made on time or within a grace period; (3) the deliverables and timeframe for them; (4) what the client&#x27;s responsibilities are (will they pay for any photos, licensing of plugins, what content they need to provide, and payment obligations; (5) I would add a clause that final copyright and/or files will not be turned over to the customer until final payment is received and cleared. Depending on the customer all of this can be something as simple as a Word document just spelling everything out that both sides agree to. If you plan to move full on with freelancing I would suggest hiring an attorney to draft up a simple contract that you can easily amend with the above details on a customer by customer basis. It may cost you a couple hundred dollars, but can be a lifesaver down the road should you run into that one customer (and the chances that will happen are pretty good if you freelance full-time).",1396739089

There are experiments that show explicitly the wave behavior of helium atoms (they have like 2 electrons and 12 quarks, and a lot of gluons, they are not a single particle) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_atom_scattering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_atom_scattering</a> . I think there are bigger examples, but I should google a little to find them.<p>Also, the superconductivity and superfluity effects are due to quantum mechanics effects (a lot of properties of solids only can be explained correctly using quantum mechanics, but they are not so evident).<p>There is more hand waving that a proof here.

When the second university in the world was founded, maybe people accused them of copying the first university, but in the long run it's been good for mankind.  Of course, if all the orgs want to talk amongst each other and pay royalties to YC, that might also be interesting.",1177228359

If you want to tailor the program to local apps, then it needs more thought. ""We're looking for great people. We don't care that much whether your idea is the best thing since sliced bread.""<p>How in the world are you going to measure ""great""? It's definitely <i>not</i> going to come through via just the 28 YC questions. They have a news site for what it's worth. A monster hacker team that cannot come up with a sellable idea is merely a great team of coders -- nothing but.<p>And why does politics need to be involved?",1177228328

15650,comment,15628,15628,0,0,brett,,,"So that I have this straight: You've tried to copy YC's approach and website as closely as possible down to featuring one of their startup's product in the middle of your page and naming your yourself so as to suggest that you're somehow affiliated and you are holding out hope that they're going to be happy (or even just not upset) with this?",1177228250

When I was in college the only people in the computer lab were IRC addicts who were too broke to afford their own computer!

15646,comment,15444,15508,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Throw those criteria out the window. Squatting is such an uncreative thing, so squatters probably are unable to ""think outside the box.""
I have stopped thinking these sites tell anything useful. What do you think of this one?<p>oi.oio.io<p>It's up for grabs (as of now), and I bet you'd remember it after a few seconds. It doesn't even need to follow a syllable rule. Too bad I don't have a product to match this name, but I think it's great. If you think otherwise, be sure to explain why.",1177227721
15645,comment,13343,13434,0,0,wordsthatendinq,,,"I don't know the consequences of posting in a 5-day old thread, but I just felt like practicing my side interest in econ.  My only experience with game theory was a half-term graduate course and I don't follow everything you're saying, but my gut feeling is that these definitions aren't important to the spirit of the article.<p>Suppose you're buying stocks; you choose a portfolio of stocks to maximize your return.  Of course you'll make mistakes and pick bad stocks, but as long as you have enough good stocks in your portfolio, you'll still turn a profit (and companies won't come and argue ""why didn't you buy my stock?""). The difference between YC and the stock market is that being chosen by YC can potentially increase your value; they are more like the coaches that train athletes.  So whatever portfolio they pick will actually end up with a higher value than if it were just left alone.  Also, it makes sense to evaluate people by things not so one-dimensional as ""ability"" (which by gyro_robo's argument we should maximize), otherwise we ignore other possible synergies between coach and trainee, such as similar personalities, that can cause the trainee to train more productively, independent of ability.<p>The problem with the stock market analogy is that all you need to do is to beat the market, and to do that you just need to perform better than average.  Actually YC could do that if all they wanted was to make some money.  Perhaps similarly, a sports coach could be lax about picking athletes if the second-best team was way behind.  This is where I see the game theory coming in.  If there was another team, similar to YC, that was similar in performance, then YC would have more of an incentive to minimize the measurement error.  I'm not saying they don't already, I'm just saying it would make sense to do so.<p>Anyway, I don't know if this makes any sense but the essay is fun and probably a good piece to show to some younger people.",1177227410
15644,comment,15444,15600,0,0,whacked_new,,,"del.icio.us is hard as hell to type. Here is my speculation.<p>First, ""del"" and ""us"" are easy to remember. Now you just place in the dots. So in terms of your memory, the difficult part is in the production phase (typing), not the storage and retrieval.<p>Second, I imagine most of its initial users were relatively well educated and web-wise.<p>Third, the lack of .com makes it unique, and at its time, a pioneer. The pioneer always has imitators, and we have seen plenty. Flickr is another one of those ""pioneers.""<p>And pioneers don't follow guidelines, because guidelines were based on the pioneers. So much for these tips; they should make a portfolio demonstrating how creative they are, like logo firms do. ""Here are some example names we've come up with: 1. Folksonomy..."" 4 syllables, 10 characters, and if you type properly, the second half of the word uses way too much index-finger.",1177227019

15637,comment,15628,15632,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I believe YC's program is quite revolutionary, both in terms of supporting innovative businesses and also as an educational opportunity; I agree that right now, they are probably the best model to follow, but copying the application verbatim doesn't reflect well on your organization.<p>For example, do you have any other ideas you thought of applying with? One may be something we've been waiting for. I'd be very surprised if at the first time of execution, you are already so confident about your judgment of the internet startup landscape. It's reasonable to assume that YC really has things in mind. In this case, you are only waiting for things to come into your mind.<p>If the YC method is good, people will learn from it, and it will flourish. But seeing how yeurope does it right now, I will be wary.",1177226110

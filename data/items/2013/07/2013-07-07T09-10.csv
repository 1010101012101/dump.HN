But instead letting all implementations at least get up to R6, they now have R7 on the horizon. They afre churning standards out more quickly as implementors can implement them.<p>And frankly, I dont see what the point will be: R7 small is not much differrent than R5, so it is kind of pointless. R7 big is as big as common lisp, and very few implementations will have the resources and the willingness to implement it and discard their current non-standard APIs they had for years. And even if the majority of them manages to implement R7, they will finally reach the point where Common LIsp was 1994, with no added value over Common Lisp, provided of course they dont decide to obsolete R7 also and get to R8 before that.",1373190653

In social groups I hung out I was usually the guy who&#x27;d defend America on numerous accounts, but in the last few weeks I&#x27;ve been bombarded by a load of information which I find to be truly chilling.<p>By the way, it is interesting to note how we separate our past history from our active perceptions of the place. America&#x27;s early history is not too bright -- we did some of the most batshit evil stuff you could think of: <i>genocide</i> of Red Indians, <i>slavery</i> (which to me when I really sit down and think deep about, sometimes, seems worse than just killing a person -- it&#x27;s fucking killing the very dignity and respect every human being is owed, it&#x27;s depriving them of any and all pleasures to life). I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve made much amends for it -- the cycle of poverty still persists for a lot of African American folks, there are rather few social programs that really try to help them in meaningfully substantive ways. There are folks alive to this very day who faced system institutional racism <i>from our government</i>.<p>We did some pretty evil stuff during and after the Cold war too -- someone linked this in another post yesterday: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentatio...</a> -- this one truly shocked me:<p><pre><code>    Researchers in the United States have performed thousands of human

    radioactive contamination on the human body, generally on people who were 
    poor, sick, or powerless.

6001559,comment,6001546,6001546,3,0,buro9,,,"There&#x27;s another set of articles bouncing around but I wanted to dredge this particular story.<p>The story is of a respected psychotherapy researcher for a Canadian university. Andrew Felmar&#x27;s profile is here: <a href=""http://www.andrewfeldmar.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.andrewfeldmar.ca/</a><p>This story was also covered here: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/aug/08/closeddoorsofperception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/aug/08/closeddo...</a><p>The gist is: In his distant past, he researched the effect of various substances that years later came to be classified as illegal substances. This was in Canada, and he attempted travel to the USA. He was declined entry to the USA as the border agency Googled his name, found his research, and considered him an admitted drug user.<p>The point of posting this in light of the NSA and PRISM revalations is to show that you needn&#x27;t have done something wrong or be doing it today, that there are examples of people who have found their past re-defined by the present and that they now breach some rules that would not have been considered back then.<p>The message I took from this at the time was this:<p><pre><code>    When Feldmar looks back on what has happened, he concludes that he was operating
    out of a sense of safety that has become dated in the last six years, since 9-11.
    His real mistake was to write about his drug experiences and post this on the web
    , even in a respected journal like Janus Head. He acknowledges that he had
    not considered posting on the Internet the risk that it turned out to be. So many
    of his generation share his experience in experimenting with drugs, after all.
    He believed it was safe to communicate about the past from the depth of
    retrospection and that this would be a useful grain of personal wisdom to share
    with others. He now warns his friends to think twice before they post anything
    about their personal lives on the web.</code></pre>",1373188791

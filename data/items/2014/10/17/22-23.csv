8473867,comment,8473771,8473771,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"> Comey went so far as to claim that Apple’s new system risks creating an environment in which the United States is “no longer a country governed by the rule of law.<p>That made me laugh. As opposed to a country where several enforcement agencies including cops can spy on masses of people to their heart&#x27;s content? It wasn&#x27;t too long ago that cops could get someone&#x27;s phone and look through it as much as they wanted. It took a battle to the Supreme Court to stop that from happening (hopefully). So I think there&#x27;s a much higher chance it&#x27;s <i>them</i> who are violating them law when the devices aren&#x27;t encrypted, than the other way around.<p>I&#x27;m glad at least some journalists are calling out FBI director&#x27;s BS arguments. Others like Washington Post and NY Times seem more than happy to give him a platform on which he can spread his propaganda to millions.

That&#x27;s clearly not a goal of their research (they discuss using their ORAM and Ostructures in the context of trusted processors).<p>2. They don&#x27;t cite any of the relevant work on verifiable computation.<p>3. They seemingly aren&#x27;t familiar with the work of the last couple years, in which substantial progress has been made on the problem of stateful verified computation (see Pantry [1], TinyRAM [2], vnTinyRAM [3], and Buffet [4]) (or, at least, they don&#x27;t acknowledge these advances), since they claim that RAM-to-circuits necessitates O(T N) blowup (in fact, best demonstrated case is O(T log(N)), though solutions with asymptotics more like O(T log(T) log(N)) have better constant factors).<p>I have not carefully examined their results or tried to reproduce them locally for comparison to my own work, but if you are interested in experimenting with verifiable computations, there are two research projects with code available you might want to look at: libSNARK [5,6] and Pepper [7,8].<p>libSNARK contains a beautifully optimized &quot;backend&quot; for verifiable execution (that is, executing the computation after it&#x27;s been translated into circuits; see the vnTinyRAM paper [3] for more details). The Pepper project has released a full pipeline (from C program to client/server binaries for verifiable execution) and an independent re-implementation of the TinyRAM and vnTinyRAM systems, but the current execution backend is not as highly optimized as libSNARK&#x27;s (though this will change in the near future).<p>(Full disclosure: I&#x27;m on the Pepper team.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/356"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/356</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/507"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/507</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/674"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/674</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.scipr-lab.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scipr-lab.org/</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.pepper-project.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pepper-project.org</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://github.com/pepper-project/pepper/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pepper-project/pepper/</a>",1413586207

8473815,comment,8472157,8473481,0,0,squeaky-clean,,,"Tabs don&#x27;t have to be just hand-scrawled notes or ASCII text anymore. With decent notation software, you can mix the notations. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much that can be written in conventional music notation that can&#x27;t be displayed in Guitar Pro (or Tux Guitar for an OSS alternative). Especially since it allows you to toggle between the two forms, or view them on top of each other.[1] You can also add rhythm and articulation notation to just tabs to make it more clear what they mean as well.[2]<p>I think it&#x27;s a great way to begin learning guitar without needing to take a lot of time to learn how to read sheet music first, as that really scares away a lot of new players, or people who are considering learning guitar. Notation for rhythm, slurs, accents, are all pretty clear and can be learned very easily. Unless there&#x27;s more that I&#x27;m not understanding about the differences between the two, I&#x27;d like to learn what it is.<p>There&#x27;s one last benefit that really makes me prefer digital tabs over conventional notation. There are a lot of songs/riffs/etc that are very dependent on the effects being used. This is more a benefit of software than tabs, because you could do this with any instrument or notation, but support for it is more common in guitar software. Being able to add effects, and mark things such as the rhythm of a wah-pedal can be very helpful as well. An example I can remember is Searching by Joe Satriani. He rocks a whammy pedal back and forth while playing an arpeggio, and I had no idea how to mimic that sound until I saw both the notes written out, and the whammy bends on the same track as well.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.zwodnik.com/media/images/tuxguitar_os-x.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zwodnik.com/media/images/tuxguitar_os-x.png</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://screenshots.s32cdn.com/34/336924/1_47.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screenshots.s32cdn.com/34/336924/1_47.png</a><p>edit: I still think it&#x27;s useful to learn theory, tabs or not.

For clojure/lisp, I found that the vim tooling was just not as elegant/efficient as emacs (fireside et al arent as nice as cider/swank), and decided to learn how to use it. It&#x27;s not that much of an &quot;antipattern&quot; because the keymaps are very different. I don&#x27;t like using vim mode within emacs either - for some reason I find myself thinking in emacs mode when editing lisps. I do think that I could be more productive in emacs if I invested more time in the tutorials, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been an issue. To me, it&#x27;s more like needing to know how to use Eclipse or IntelliJ to program in Java since their tooling is so great.",1413585969

We used Fresnel lenses printed on cheap, rigid, inflatable substrates to focus highly concentrated light on very high efficiency multi-junction cells(with real-world efficiencies of >40%), using high precision independently tracking platforms.<p>A few points:<p>* Simplicity is success, the more complicated your process is, the more likely it will fail. Our rig was complicated, but your proposed solution is much much more so.<p>* CPV is the leper of the solar industry, nearly every player in the CPV space is dead or dying, and most VC&#x27;s avoid it like the plague.<p>* With any high concentration CPV system, you will not generate power and potentially melt/destroy your rig if you do not have an accurate tracking system, which are expensive and often require constant maintenance.<p>* Quantum dot solar cells basically don&#x27;t exist outside of theory. The highest efficiency I&#x27;ve heard coming lab examples is somewhere below 10%. Multi-junction cells, although expensive, do exist and are obtainable(spectrolab, etc).<p>* Every time light reflected or otherwise interacts with a non-vaccum medium, it loses energy. CPV system should be designed to interact with the light as little as possible, while the above design seems to maximize interaction.<p>* Module costs are in constant decline and unpredictably so, it is extremely dangerous to build any business module based on current 1-sun panel prices (see solyndra).<p>* There are massive infrastructures in place to deliver electrical energy, while very few to deliver light energy, and none at all to deliver this sort of high energy light. In short, it would be far more technologically and economically efficient to deliver power to areas remote from the generate site by converting it to electricity.<p>* In reference to your comment related to shifting the light to a specific frequency: It is very difficult to shift the frequency of light, and there are losses and limitations ( see raman shifting). If you could design a system to shift wide band EM radiation to a single band, cheaply, without significant losses, you would have revolutionized no just the solar energy sector, but a great many other industries as well. I have seen prismatic systems which split light into different bands, each which are channelled to a solar cell with a matching band gap, but once again, the cost and loss made this approach uninviting.<p>* In short:  How does this unit track the sun, as that&#x27;s the first hurdle to handle with any CPV solution. Then what are your optical losses? What&#x27;s LCOE can be expected from this sort of design and how does that compare to a 1-sun type module bench mark. What are the benefits of this design of current designs? If you are looking to build a product, you should define a MVP: a simple demo that can demonstrate value to somebody. If you are trying to assist the world in general with intellectual philanthropy, I would better define how this system could be expected to perform, and how is it better/cheaper/whatever-er than the current systems.",1413585511

When thinking about Schrödinger&#x27;s cat, [1] I imagined that the cat remained dead (and in every other possible state) even after the observer had confirmed the cat was alive. Every unobserved state did not collapse, but became inaccessible by means currently understood. Those states could still be observed by the same or another observer from a different perspective (i.e. revisiting the event).

You could say they could go to a garage sale, and they <i>may</i> find something acceptable at a reasonable price, but what if they don&#x27;t have a vehicle large enough to transport it or people to help load and unload it? Most RTO places offer delivery, and most garage sales don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s more or less the same case with Craigslist; while your chances of finding someone willing to make delivery may increase, you only have a crappy photo taken with a potato to try to decide if you want it or not.<p>Compare to buying a couch like a normal person at a normal furniture retailer. If you have the income to sustain the payments and know that you&#x27;ll be paying more in the long run, it&#x27;s a tradeoff some people are willing to make. Most of the time, you can pay off rentals early.<p>The same kind of shenanigans go on with any financial instrument when one is considered &quot;high risk&quot;. Credit cards charge ~30% APR until you have a well-established credit history. Car loans cost 15-20%. In any of these cases, you&#x27;re a fool if you let the full term run out at those rates.

8473682,comment,8471638,8471638,0,0,srean,,,"I found it interesting to note that one of their use case is numerical integration. As of now Hope does method by method JIT. Numerical integration is one of those things where just &quot;method by method&quot; JIT leaves substantial room for improvement. It is the poster child used to showcase the strength of Stalin, the lisp compiler that substantially outperforms numerical integrator written in C. The main feature that Stalin uses to achieve that impressive performance is inlining of the function that needs to be integrated, right into the integration code. Such inlining is hard to do when code reside in separate compilation unit, separate functions and loaded dynamically, especially when the caller is only aware of a function pointer and not much else. The later the integration routine is compiled, more chance would there be for the compiler to know more about the function pointer, and JIT could potentially help a lot here.<p>It is indeed possible to do these inlining in C++ using its template machinery but it seems Hope does not to this yet. I am really curious about what Hope does and what plans do they have for the future. Inlining does give huge speedup for this application, more so if one is performing multidimensional numeric integration.<p>Another thing that I was curious about was how does Hope optimize away the dynamic semantics of Python. If one where to isolate one aspect of Python that makes it ridiculously hard to speed it up, it is its dynamic nature. It seems that Hope removes the dynamic aspect by analyzing the AST of the Python code. Since Python was never intended to be type inferred, it surely poses a substantial obstacle. I wonder whether Hope devs intend to add the Cython functionality of selectively removing dynamic nature of specific functions via annotations. Given the difficulty of automatic static typing of a piece of Python code, any little help afforded to the compiler should go a long way.<p>The other thing that I am really curious about is what does Hope do about Numpy vector expressions. Cython for example calls back into Numpy, so there is not much speed benefit to be had. In fact if this is being done in a loop, this hurts performance because of the overhead of the call. So if one really wants performance one needs to write the low level indexing code in the Cython syntax. I think it is a matter of personal taste, but if I were to write low-level C,C++;  I would rather write it in C,C++ itself. The latter has the additional benefit of mature toolchains that target C, C++.<p>Finally, a number of tools aimed at similar use cases have been mentioned in the post and in the comments. I will add a shout out for copperhead. It isolates a subset of Python over which one can define a ML like semantics which is then used to aid compilation and parallelization, all hiding behind the familiar python syntax.",1413584605

The protocol has evolved over time, and as a result of wanting the most number of people to use it as possible, it&#x27;s not configured by default to be the most secure; it&#x27;s designed to be the most compatible. The best practice is to install it, and then tighten security <i>to your use case</i>.<p>Secondly, &#x27;easy&#x27; is 100% subjective. To me it&#x27;s incredibly easy to set up TLS.

The consonant barbershop seventh chord was a relevation to me when I first learned of it. It&#x27;s really close to the dissonant dominant 7th interval, but serves a very different purpose harmonically. The minor seventh is also a different interval.

But it isn&#x27;t necessarily a state entity that would do so, and this is clearly a main point of disagreement here.<p>I think (in this arbitrary and unrealistic scenario) those &quot;alternative institutions&quot; would be or rapidly become very governmentlike; whether they would be institutions with a flag and a seat the united nations is not terribly important. Honestly I don&#x27;t see much difference even today between governments, large NGOs, and large corporations; all have similar decisionmaking processes and act in similar ways (though as I said, I think accountability is better for governments - and probably even worse for large NGOs). Some people consider a &quot;monopoly on violence&quot; to be a qualitative difference between government and non-government large organizations, but these &quot;alternative institutions&quot; in your scenario would definitely have to be willing to back up their policies with force, so they&#x27;d be governmentlike in that respect too.",1413583683

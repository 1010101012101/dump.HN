I think a lot of it depends on how much of an effort is taken to make females happy and to recruit them. Or if there is a female involved in the early stages of the company.
Still that 15% mark seems low. It may be worth discussing with your management about how to make the workplace better and how to recruit women better. Maybe mentorship programs or hosting 'women in tech' events
I have to admit this discussion makes me feel weird. It's a bit odd to think about people based on their attributes. It's like thinking about coworkers based on their height.",1360720784

5210856,comment,5209870,5209870,1,0,vorg,,,"> We use Groovy a lot at SPUN and we love it. Our CMS is written in grails and our feed consumption sponge is Groovy + Jetty and GPars with a frontend written in KnockoutJS. What I like most about groovy is that it builds on the existing Java ecosystem and, being so close to Java, new developers can learn it in no time. Once you get into the new features that Groovy brings to the table it really makes coding a lot more fun, but you can learn those features over time while still being productive with your existing Java chops.<p>What new features are these? Static compilation is hardly production ready, as seen by this bug in Groovy 2.1.0 reported only last week... <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14774709/groovy-2-1-0-weird-behaviour-of-switch-case-break-statement-with-compilestatic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14774709/groovy-2-1-0-wei...</a><p>Groovy's static compilation came with Groovy 2.0. Although officially released in June 2012, it <i>really wasn't released for production use until it was bundled as part of Grails</i> 2.2 in Dec 2012. The 6 months from June to December was unofficially <i>just more beta-testing</i> with a larger base of users, those who download standalone releases of Groovy. Grails, however, doesn't use any of the static compilation features in Groovy 2.0. All the testing of Groovy 2.0 was just to make sure the inclusion of static compilation in Groovy <i>didn't break any of its dynamic compilation use in Grails</i>.<p>Maybe the new feature in Groovy 2 you're talking about is invoke-dynamic. In both Groovy 2.0 and 2.1, the code using invoke-dynamic is bundled in a separate jar-file which only runs on Java 7. Grails and Gradle don't bundle this other invoke-dynamic jar file, and don't intend to for Grails 2.3 and Groovy 2.1 either. Whereas the legacy stream of Groovy can be tested to see that the static compilation doesn't break the preexisting dynamic compilation, the invoke-dynamic jar needs far more testing because it would actually replace the existing dynamic-compilation codebase, so Grails and Gradle won't bundle it.<p>You're just a patsy of the Groovy/Grails project management pitching for Groovy 2.1 beta-testers for Grails 2.3 when you write in your blog: ""Once you get into the new features that Groovy brings to the table it really makes coding a lot more fun, but you can learn those features over time while still being productive with your existing Java chops.""<p>If you really want static compilation, use Scala which has been battle-tested far longer than Groovy's. If you really want invoke dynamic, use JRuby which bundled it even _before_ Java 7 was released. Groovy is really only useful if you use Grails, and for quick testing scripts - quick to write but slow to run, that is.",1360720480

That followed by verifying how correct it was with the w3c validator with strict mode. Also lots of changing css styles to *{border: 1px solid #000} to see how things were out of wack. I'm sure there's a somewhat better way than just dealing with trial and error and figuring out how css plays with html through the same manner & validating, but for the patient, it works out.<p>Thankfully now, browsers come with good editing tools to see html elements without crappy css hacks. I've always seen universities pushing GUI tools on students to learn HTML, but I really don't think that's the best way to do it. Showing them how the tags work, what they are for and using tools such as firebug is a much better way imho.",1360720421

This can result in a loss of activities from the city. This study compiles data from 12 cities in the United States to test these theoretical relationships.

5210744,comment,5208461,5208461,3,0,KenBernstetin,,,"A friend of mine just let me know this was posted over here.  I regret that i do not have time to respond to all the comments - I have received several hundred emails directly as a result of the posting at the Washington Post.  I will when I have time come back and read through and where appropriate offer responses.  For now I want to acknowledge that many of you are taking the time to offer thoughtful comments, even if I may think you misunderstand either purpose of the piece or why I wrote it.  Let me offer a few general comments.<p>1.  No Child Behind does not exist in isolation.  Before it there were A Nation At Risk and Goals 2000, both of which are part of the ethos from which NCLB flowed.  Since NCLB, Race to the Top has if anything made thingsworse.<p>2. Unlike its predecessors, NCLB had punitive sanctions that began to distort the learning process.  When the courses I taught in government were in 9th grade, we began seeing kids arrive at our high school with NO social studies to speak of in elementary or middle school, because those subjects were not tested for Adequate Yearly Progress, the standard by which schools were measured under NCLB.<p>3. I did not teach just elite students.  My last 7 years I taught both the regular level government classes and AP US Government and Politics.  For the 1st 6 of those years half of my sections were in each course.  The last year 4 were AP.  Thus I taught a spectrum of abilities.  Nevertheless, the gifted students in my AP classes were decreasingly ready to handle the kind of thinking necessary for that course.<p>4. do not presume that I EVER resorted to drill and kill for tests.  But I fought losing battles.  The school system began demanding every teacher in every course do system designed benchmarks.  But in AP there was not a common curriculum, because each AP teacher had to submit his or her own syllabus to the College board.  I approached the material in a different fashion, one which served my students well both as to their learning but also in how they performed on the AP exam.  And yet they would be required to sit for poorly designed tests often on material I had not yet addressed in class.<p>5.  Because test scores began to matter so much, the school system wanted interim tests, which scores broken out by indicators, with teachers required to explain why students had scored poorly on some indicators and to present a plan of remediation.  Again, I did not follow the county pacing guide, which may be why I had the best performance in any of the 20+ high schools on the state exam - one year I had 129 students sit for the state exam and 126 passed - ten of those passing having failed all four quarter with me.  Certainly I had demonstrated that my students were prepared.  Perhaps I should have been asked to draft the pacing guide.  At least when it came to AP, I was asked to run a Saturday course to which students from other schools could come to get assistance from me.   But when I get told that I am REQUIRED to waste time on tests on material my students have not yet studied and then waste more time explaining why they did not do well on certain indicators, I think you can begin to understand some of my frustration.<p>I was for a while the only teacher on the county wide panel designing how our school system was going to tie teacher evaluation to student performance, a requirement under Race to the Top.  I disagreed with the notion, but was asked both by central office administrators and by the executive director of the union to serve because I understood the literature as well as anyone in the county.  We worked hard, designed a system, did some beta testing, only to have the state reject it because we did not meet some percentage on one criteria that they had arbitrarily set at 20% and we had set at 15%, in agreement among the testing office, the top administration, teachers, counselors, etc.<p>What is happening to our students as result of educational policy which focuses on testing - and in this case NCLB is the primary culprit - is denying them a meaningful learning experience.  Because we put so much weight on the test scores, the focus in the school and the classroom becomes those tests, increasingly to the exclusion of other things.<p>My article for Academe only scratched the surface of what is wrong.<p>My warning, however, is real, and it is not just about the students arriving on college campuses.  There are already proposals to evaluated professors in schools of education on the basis of the test scores of K-12 students taught by their graduates.  Let me be blunt - this is idiotic.  The professional literature does NOT support evaluating those K-2 teachers by student test scores, not even when using value-added assessments, which have all kinds of problems that have still not been solved.  To attempt to use them to draw valid conclusions at one further step away from what the tests were designed to do - which is to measure what students can do at one particularly moment in time - is downright dangerous.<p>As to those who think teachers still have the ability to use their own best judgment, perhaps to learn the appropriate research and apply it on their own?  That ignores that increasingly we are seeing superintendents who want everyone on the same page at the same time, with rigid pacing guides, whether the students can move faster or need to move slower.<p>Before I was a teacher I worked with computers for 20 years.  The old IBM cards were clearly labeled ""Do not fold, spindle or mutilate.""  At least they were standard - in size, in how information was recorded.<p>Our students are not standard.  And what we are doing to them is folding, spindling, and mutilating - their natural love of learning, their ability to draw meaning from their studies.<p>It is one reason why they will be less and less prepared for post-secondary education.<p>It is why the fastest growing classes on many campuses are remedial courses to make up for what they didn't learn in high school, even if they passed all the required tests with flying colors.",1360718705

Perhaps its just an ""in my day..."" sort of bias but I do feel like the 90s were of higher quality than content of today.<p>Most hit shows of the '00s till today are invariantly tied up in trying to peddle toys of some kind. Certainly older shows were used for merchandizing but it seems like today the toy comes first and the show is developed around it. Plot development is optional and stories need not build off one another or refer back to past episodes. Out of those the early seasons of Pokemon and Digimon weren't bad and there are certainly a few neat shows on Disney & Nickelodeon (The Fairly Odd Parents and Sponge Bob come to mind).<p>Aside from that it seems like a lot of shows lack the complex story telling of shows like Batman: TAS, Superman: TAS, Spiderman, Beastwars, Reboot, XMen, and the others mentioned in the article. While not really a kids show (seriously -  watch this as an adult and its 10 times funnier), Freakazoid outdoes most content peddled to adult audiences.<p>Another thing I've observed that seems to be detrimental to animated shows is the rise of cheap soap opera style live animation in place of cartoons. Probably the biggest example is Miley Cyrus' early career (Hannah Montana, etc). These shows let companies monetize in more ways since you can create concert movies and albums and the fanbase will follow the actor/actress to multiple shows. Benda Song[1] has spent nearly a decade jumping between various TV shows on the Disney channel (and playing a pretty good 'crazy girlfriend' in the Social Network IMO). I'm sure there are many other examples (all the faces seem to look the same between Disney's shows) but she stands out to me since she's seemingly the only cast member my age in shows filled with 12-16 year olds.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Song"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Song</a>",1360718196

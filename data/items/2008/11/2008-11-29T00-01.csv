The rational/scientific arguments can be argued. Tough to stand in a clearcut and say 'damn happy we got rid of those trees!'. ;)",1227920164

You overtake a car on the right, and immediately slow down and go into the left lane. When the other car passes you, you speed up and overtake on the right again. You will then be making circles around the other car, but when seen from above, both of you are driving forward all the time and your path will be convex.""",1227920143

379716,comment,379379,379379,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I, for one, love pseudo-science. I dig UFO studies (what better way to learn about the process of learning?), world religions (what drives people to vary their beliefs so widely yet cling to each detail?), reincarnation (are those strange stories true or just crap?) and all sorts of things that involve reason, creativity, and some sort of evidential and symbolic modeling process.<p>But I know it ain't science. It's fun, it's speculative, and it's entertaining. It ain't science.<p>What I don't like is when religion joins with theories that can not be reliably tested and scare-mongering under the rubric of science. Then they deny being the pseudo science that they are. Seems like it combines the worst of everything: end-of-days, a call for repentance, smearing the critics, and smarmy self-righteousness.<p>That's just my opinion, mind you. I really think if you've only got one earth, a hugely complex environment and some kind of computer modeling system that a little degree of humility probably is a good idea. I'm happy with saying ""I don't know."" Seems like even (or especially) if you take a large grant that should be a fine response.<p>Global warming may be true and deadly. But that still doesn't make it science.<p>I'm looking forward to the new Czech pol. Discussion and skepticism is a good thing, especially when it comes to science.",1227919291

379695,comment,379411,379449,0,0,dpatru,,,"The problem is this: if the Canadian telecom market were open to competition, why doesn't a new competitor move in and clobber the existing phone companies in the market? I read the article and in two of the three complaints, the writer is angry because government doesn't fix the problems he sees in the marketplace. The government won't force Bell to give small ISPs unlimited bandwidth and the government is allowing SMS ""price gouging"". (The writer's other complaint is that the government wants to modernize copyright, I assume that means that government wants to extend the existing copyright laws to the internet.)<p>The writer implies that outside competition is not a viable solution and that consumer wellbeing is solely a function of government whim.<p>Assuming the writer knows what he's (not) talking about, i.e., that outside competition is not an option, then I can only assume that the reason it's not an option is because of the existing regulatory environment.<p>The writer's proposed solution seems to me to be calling for yet more regulation.<p>So it appears that in Canada government is keeping competition out and not doing enough to force existing companies to increase their quality of service and decrease their prices.<p>Excuse me for assuming that over-regulation is the problem. Now I see that Canada needs more regulation. Government there is not doing enough to tell businesses what they need to do, what kind of contracts they can make, and what prices they can charge. Of course this would also make Canada more open to competition. Businesses just love to do business in a place where government bureaucrats help them with lots of detailed rules that require teams of lawyers to figure out. Businesses, especially startups, also like it when government forces them to rewrite contracts and charge lower prices. Thanks for setting me straight.",1227917299

6822527,comment,6820474,6822317,1,0,rbehrends,,,"<i>Once you go thread-safe, RC updates become extremely expensive, while concurrent GC is well-studied and performant.</i><p>This is simply false. In fact, concurrent versions of deferred reference counting have been known and studied for years [1]. The simple solution is to store the RC updates in a buffer and execute them only during a collection phase.<p><i>Pause time is a form of overhead. It reduces both latency and throughput.</i><p>Yes, but for many applications (e.g., HPC) only amortized cost is relevant.<p>Note also that you <i>can</i> do cycle detection concurrently with the mutator&#x27;s operation (again, see [1]). Concurrent cycle detection makes the implementation more complicated, but no more so than a concurrent tracing scheme. Moreover, if your program is indeed performance-critical, RC schemes allow you to minimize the impact on cycle detection by designing your code so as to avoid cycles (either by using acyclic data structures exclusively or by using weak pointers). Conversely, tracing schemes make it difficult to programmatically influence worst case pause time.<p>[1] E.g., <a href=\"http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/Bacon03Pure.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/B...</a>",1385794418

Any San Jose State professor who had taught an introduction to statistics could have told him that many (most?) of his students would not have basic arithmetic skills and would &quot;hate math.&quot; They are not Stanford students.&quot;<p>Thrun is an elite academic. He has most likely never even attended a university that had to teach remedial math courses, let alone taken or taught one. Thus, by extension, he has likely never had to deal with students who had anything but excellent preparation for studying the material he was teaching.<p>I sat through most of Thrun&#x27;s AI lectures and I felt that he and Norvig were questionable teachers. They are clearly brilliant men, and their excitement was contagious. They would be tremendous guest-lecturers in any CS course (the particle filter lectures were Thrun&#x27;s best because he was so excited, but he spent most of his time gushing about how cool the ideas were). But as far as teaching a course to non-Stanford students without the help of an army of TAs, they were uninspired.<p>Compare Thrun&#x27;s experience with the sentiments in this article about Miami University in Ohio: <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/on-country-club-campuses-a-public-university-ex-president-shares-his-second\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.propublica.org/article/on-country-club-campuses-a...</a><p>The common vein is that education is fairly easy when the people you are educating are well-prepared and generally hail from the upper half of the socioeconomic spectrum.<p>Teaching poor kids, and kids who, for other reasons do not have adequate preparation is really something of a Sisyphean task. The problem is not in our schools, and it can&#x27;t be fixed by fiddling with the curriculum or delivery method, it can only be truly fixed by fixing the underlying social problems, but that usually means talking about sticky issues like racism, sexism, ethno-centrism, and capitalism itself.",1385793400

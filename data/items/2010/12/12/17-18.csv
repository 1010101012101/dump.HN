Incorrect in that it doesn't reflect the exact way that history was constructed locally? Spoiler: it rarely does. Every —amend, every usage of a queue (MQ, Quilt, …), every patchbomb sent to a mailing list means the history recorded won't exactly reflect the way it was created. And that's for the better: history should be crafted for sense, not for useless historical correctness.",1292176738

It seems more likely to me that's the balance point between the bulls and the bears.<p>The author pointed out the bear story for RIM.   The bullish story for RIM is straightforward too:  they're obviously working on a QNX-based rewrite of their OS.  The blackberry platform has enough advantages, devoted followers and hasn't lost too much momentum, so they just need a solid offering with slight advantages and disadvantages compared to Android & iOS to do well.

So instead of saying ""we'll be on site 2 Feb 11"", thus setting ourselves a deadline without holding others accountable for their deadlines, we say ""we'll be on site 3 weeks after all design review issues are closed, and this list of actions is complete"".<p>It's not a silver bullet. It has worked wonders for controlling risk associated with penalty clauses in contracts, and cuts out the need for a lot of communication (i.e. bitching and CYA tactics).

1997441,comment,1997261,1997361,0,0,gruseom,,,"Git has changed how I work with and even think about a codebase, and rebase is a big part of that. Because of git's speed, the warm fuzzy security provided by its hashing mechanism, and a few other things, a new dimension (time) has opened up for organizing my ideas and experiments. Before git, committing to source control was like laying down layers in concrete. That meant going back and fixing anything was a concrete-smashing construction project, and that led to a mental model in which version history was just a documentary record: if things were originally done in order X,Y,Z, to turn that into X',Y',Z' would be to falsify history. With git I have a different mental model: the temporal dimension is no longer just a factual history (though it still is that at a large scale). It's now a medium for organizing and reorganizing things logically. It's like having a new scratch buffer in your brain.<p>Such a new medium is a rarity in programming and can take a long time before it finds its proper place. It seems flawed because it deviates from the ""normal"" way. But this new tool has led to breakthroughs in how my designs evolve, and I wouldn't give it up willingly. That's despite the fact that some of the criticisms of rebase are real: e.g. you can break previous commits without knowing it. The value of the feature far outweighs these costs, at least for the projects I've used it on. You know how Lisp programmers go on about how malleable Lisp programs are, like you're molding in clay rather than pouring concrete? It's analogous to that.<p>Edit: another analogy is interactivity. Rebase gives you a feedback loop into the evolution of your code the way that REPLs give you a feedback loop into its execution. Qualitatively new feedback loops are extraordinarily valuable.",1292175699

1997431,comment,1992433,1994981,0,0,pocoloco,,,"Sorry for taking this long to reply. Lots of errands to do.<p>An embedded programmer is a catch-all adjective I think. One could be working on very low level programming of microcontrollers (e.g., PIC32, MSP430) and FPGAs [11].<p>On the other end of the spectrum, you can find embedded programmers working on embedded devices that hosts complete systems with OS, filesystems and utilities such as the ELDK (referred in previous posts). The duties for such programmers include creating device drivers for the specific devices that the product has. I have for example, modified an existing application developed originally for a system with no OS into a Linux application running on a PowerPC board. For example, some of my duties were to modify the original application's absolute FLASH memory references to a method compatible with what the Linux based system offers (hint: I used mmap).<p>I would guess that someone like yourself with limited exposure to electronics would be guided toward the latter type of jobs. From my limited experience in my local area I believe that this type of jobs offers the best balance. Latter on you can move deeply into low-level development once you have beefed-up your resume if you so desire.<p>The trick here is to be identified by a competent manager that can match your education and experience to his needs. And you`ll be surprised how little managers need to know, technically speaking, to get a product going which means that you need to sell yourself well.<p>Senior positions depend heavily into the nature of the company. I find that importance given to hierarchy between employees is proportional to the amount of bureaucracy present. This translates into defined roles, which will need to be created (i.e., company is growing) or the position becomes available (i.e., because of retirement or lay-off). So for example, if you want to become an architect where you actually design a product or part of it; it will be harder in a big company. Smaller companies suffer less from hierarchy and give more chances to hold important and challenging positions but the pay usually lags far behind the bigger companies.<p>The best ways to get a job depend largely on the type of jobs available which are dictated by the companies implanted there. Where I am, there were several small companies that needed someone that could wear lots of hats. That`s how I started back 10 years ago. I had to manage a small network, program an 8-bit HC11 microcontroller, design the PCB, select the electronic components, do some soldering, do some mechanical design, and train the client and fix the bugs once the product was out the door. This path has led me to be a generalist rather than a specialist.<p>But I talked no long ago to the guy that was my boss back then, and he said that these days is cheaper to contract out the small jobs to specialized shops which wasn't the case back then or at least he wasn't aware of competent companies that offered a reasonable cost. So things do change. Be prepared to turn on a dime.<p>I think that you should not have too many problems going the embedded way. But you'll need to help the hiring person to match your skills to their needs. They may just assume that they need an EE just because they're working very close to the hardware. I think that you have a bright future. One of the most competent embedded programmers that I've met did a BSCS.<p>I hope I did not go ramble too much and loose you in the middle. Just one more thing. Remember that your worst enemy is yourself. Don't let self-doubt and/or laziness to get in the way. Control those and you'll have a good future.<p>[11] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array</a>",1292175493

Both OpenBSD and GRSecurity are ""exploit-aware"" security models: they're both built assuming that there's no way to secure an operating system without keeping abreast of what people are actually doing to break systems. But OpenBSD has picked a fight with computer science that it can't win: its model depends on shipping bug-free distributions --- which is why its security claims get more and more specific over the years.",1292174693

The first fragment of this sentence is genuine Marx, writing for the New York Daily Tribune, as a one-second search would have shown him. The second I cannot find; it is certainly not in the same article, as the ellipsis fraudulently suggests. If it exists the chances that it refers to a transition to socialism, communism, or whatever Marx is supposed to have favored, are certainly zero.<p>In the Daily Tribune article, Marx is discussing emigration (mostly to America) from England, Ireland and Scotland, in the years around 1850, and the gruesome commentary of English writers of the period.<p>The Economist, for example, he quotes as writing:<p>""The departure of the redundant part of the population of Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland is an indispensable preliminary to every kind of improvement. The revenue of Ireland has not suffered in any degree from the famine of 1846-47, or from the emigration that has since taken place. On the contrary, her net revenue amounted in 1851 to £4,281,999, being about £184,000 greater than in 1843""<p>I.e. they ""regard ‘Net-Revenue’ as the Moloch to whom entire populations must be sacrificed..."" as Marx puts the view of  the Ricardians.<p>The context can be found here on a website for true believers: <a href=""http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/03/04.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/03/04.htm</a><p>I don't see any easy way of search for ancient Economist articles, but I notice that in the same year the American writer Carey quoted the same passage as from ""Economist, (London,) Feb. 12, 1853."" in his book on the slave trade <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8000/pg8000.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8000/pg8000.txt</a>",1292173723

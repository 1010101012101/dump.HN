Science works by quantifying what is the norm through carefully controlled studies. The reason that alternative treatments are fiercely dismissed by many physicians is because they know, on account of said science, that they should not be the first course of action. Empirically, they work far too infrequently. Until an alternative treatment can demonstrate that it works for a statistically significant sample size it should not be recommended as the first course of action. However, if it does prove to be a viable treatment in a statistically significant study, it becomes part of mainstream medicine, not an ""alternative"" therapy.",1309182379

If the error rate seen by the channel decoder is too high, it will drop a frame.  There is an ARQ mechanism in the MAC layer to try to compensate so that the higher layers don't see the loss, but it implies some delay and also has limits -- i.e. at some point losses due to bit errors injected by the channel may manifest in lost frames and IP packets.<p>The L1 and MAC of 3GPP are generally implemented in an ASIC and not necessarily visible to the OS.  Many of the parameters are dictated and controlled by the RAN (operators are picky and try to control things so that handsets can't misbehave and crap all over the other users in a cell), so the OS doesn't get a look in -- i.e. I don't think it's possible to turn off the 3G error recovery mechanisms.<p>Disclaimer:  I used to work at L1 so someone with more detailed knowledge the MAC and higher layers of the 3GPP stack could give a better idea of what happens when the MAC ARQ limits are hit.<p>Summary:  3G was designed more than 10 years ago and is showing its age.  User requirements have shifted, but standards can't evolve that quickly.  Maybe LTE will help provide the user experience for today's apps... question is whether it will be widely deployed in time to matter.<p>EDIT: updated for clarity and spelling.",1309180558

2701150,comment,2700791,2700964,21,0,lucasjung,,,"I think by ""new pilots"" they mean ""new pilots at regional carriers,"" not ""new pilots at the majors."" Of course, these days, the regional carriers have become the primary path to employment in the majors (it used to be the military), so most airline pilots have to endure a few years of that. The fact is, a lot of people love to fly (at the controls, not in the back), so getting paid to fly for a living is an incredible draw. When you add in the great benefits and the high pay for experienced pilots, you're bound to get a situation where people have to pay some serious dues to break into the majors.<p>My dad is a retired airline pilot, so I've heard plenty about the airline industry from him. For airline pilots, seniority is <i>everything</i>. Part of it is the pay scale, which as you pointed out, is unbelievably steep: the new guys get paid almost nothing, the oldest hands make (at least) the kind of money people normally associate with lawyers and doctors. However, other things that dramatically effect lifestyle are also driven by seniority, such as scheduling and vacation. The senior pilots are able to schedule themselves for contiguous trips and to be home for weekends. My dad used to pull a trick where, if we were planning a vacation, he would book himself up solid with flying for the first two and a half weeks of the month and then hit his legal monthly limit for flight time, after which he got the last week and a half of the month off without having to take any vacation. New guys, on the other hand, get stuck with crazy schedules where there are inconvenient gaps between flights, leaving them with low ratios of hours flown/days worked. Seniority also determines where you can get stationed: the most senior get to pick their home station, the more junior must select less-desirable stations. The most important aspect of seniority is furlough: least senior gets furloughed first. In a cyclic industry with big swings of expansion and contraction, this is a very big deal. When my dad first got out of the Navy and went to work for Pan Am, they gave him an offer: start immediately as a flight engineer and move up to co-pilot in a year, or wait six months to hire on directly as a co-pilot. Even though he wanted to get back into the pilot's seat as quickly as possible, he chose to hire on immediately and delay co-pilot status. He didn't know it at the time, but it turned out to be the best career decision he ever made: a few years later there was a major furlough, and he was just a few seniority numbers above the furlough line. If he had waited those six months, he would have been furloughed and out of work for several <i>years</i>.<p>It's not set up this way because of the airlines, its because of the pilots' unions. Part of it is driven by position: Captains get paid more than co-pilots, and pilots of bigger jets (longer flights) get paid more than pilots of smaller jets (shorter flights). Even that is driven by seniority, though: the most senior pilots get the big jets. Some aspects of the seniority system make complete sense: you don't want the airline to use a furlough as an excuse to get rid of its most highly-paid pilots. However, the pay scale doesn't need to be nearly as steep as the unions make it, and if it wasn't so steep then the airlines wouldn't have to lay off as many junior pilots to save a given amount of money.",1309180126

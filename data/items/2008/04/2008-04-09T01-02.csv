158470,comment,158285,158285,0,0,truebosko,,,"Great idea, here's some thoughts:
- I signed up and it put me in a google gadget widger page, but it's not actually a google gadget. <a href=""http://widget.learnitlists.com/orkut/index/google_gadget"" rel=""nofollow"">http://widget.learnitlists.com/orkut/index/google_gadget</a> is the url I am talking about. It was just kind of confusing to be put in there<p>- I was tossed into it without any explanation and words began revealing themselves if I clicked on things but I could not type in the words I knew (Or is that not how it works?) It looked like I was supposed to begin typing/guessing the words but it doesn't seem to be the case.<p>Great front page though, made me want to try it right away",1207706234

  MySpace

  Photobucket
  Flickr

Wait. Every single one of these startups is advertising supported. I wonder why people think advertising is a workable business model...",1207705622

Like for instance, I think ""You can now learn a few words of your chosen language every day."" Should be WAY BIGGER AND IMPORTANT.<p>I like easy, as does everyone else, so make juice worth the squeeze.<p>Like :

I dont have to think what it is really...I think this will increase your user signups. As well as making that sign up button <i>WAY</i> bigger.<p>Additionally, that sign up page it has ""I am Learning"" then an options like ""German <> English""...What's that about? Why not just ask me what language I want to learn and what language I speak don't confuse me... I mean what does that even mean anyway...<p>Also, when I click one word and it loops through the list, I meant for the word to translate on the other side, not have the flashing red words in the top left...<p>And what's with the poll? lol<p>That's everything from me.

158451,comment,158450,158450,0,0,Alex3917,,,"The way scientists currently combat rusts is they go down to northern Mexico each winter to survey the new strains each year so they can try to create pesticides and resistant wheat strains accordingly. The reason they go to Mexico is that the wheat grows there first, and then in Texas and the other border states when it gets a little warmer, and then finally you get the wheat crop in midwest and Canada. The spores are produced first in Mexico and then blow northwards and infect the new wheat in each climate region as it begins to grow. However, Ug99 is able to completely destroy 99% of the world's wheat population. If someone were to bring a single teaspoon of this stuff back from the middle east and put it in just the right field in northern Mexico then the potential exists to destroy a very large percentage of the north american wheat crop. Really scary stuff. It's been in the news this week because the Gates foundation just gave Cornell a 26 million dollar grant to work on the problem:<p><a href=""http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April08/wheat.rust.lm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April08/wheat.rust.lm.ht...</a>",1207703298

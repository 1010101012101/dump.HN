Or using C where it's inappropriate (or not using C where it's appropriate).<p>Though I do agree that ridding your code of compiler warnings is a good idea in general.  Because when a warning comes up afterwards, it will actually have some signalling value, instead of being ignored in a sea of similar warnings.",1278147286

It's a good point you make, yes, people are after their interests. But it also indicates that they take the time and allocate resources towards a personal touch. They probably also put a little more time into learning details about you and generally caring for you. Carried forwards, it's probably a more customer-centric, personal touch type company and you're more likely to get good service there than elsewhere (as long as this touch isn't just on customer acquisition).<p>I've used a fair number of banks, Citizen's Banks kicks the hell out of everyone else. I mean, sure, it's probably part of their strategy, but it's still pretty awesome that when I was a nobody with no cash in their bank that I was able to meet the VP of a branch and talk with him an hour about my goals and get some advice. Later when I had more money I got close to the business banker at a new branch I moved to and I was in his office once every two weeks... I'd have business there to do wire transfers about that often, but even if I didn't I'd often drop by and lend him a book or he'd lend me a book, things like that.<p>Heck, you could make the same argument about a French restaurant - they're not <i>really</i> cooking the food nicely to please you, they're doing it as a strategy to keep you coming back. But as long as they serve a good meal, do you care? I say three cheers for good customer service and personal touches if you want it in a certain industry.

Heck, I wonder what answers that'll get on Hacker News!<p>If you read ""science"" as ""survival of the fittest for theories"", then there is indeed room for people to have all sorts of biases. There are always folks who watch out for these biases. The big pool of those biases evolves towards some consensus about ""reality"" through argument and evidence collection. Over time, the most persistent of these ideas become ""intuition"".<p>... but that's probably a gross simplification of affairs. If it can take science 20 years to confirm some simple causal relation such as ""smoking causes cancer"", it is not at all surprising that people might doubt the power of the scientific method. If skepticism is healthy, isn't it also healthy to be skeptical about the completeness of science? Is the ""scientific community"" saying ""you have to skeptical about everything ... except science""? Isn't that a religion then?<p>Psychology and medicine probably have the hardest time here.

2845729,comment,2844747,2845580,2,0,cousin_it,,,"IMO what you call the ""computational model"" of Scheme is also a poor fit for beginning web programmers. The most straightforward model is exemplified by PHP: put a file on the server, type its path into a browser, get the page. Change the code, refresh the page. I'm not defending the language design choices PHP made, but it <i>nailed</i> rapid development and deployment. Every environment that requires a recompile or restart feels like a huge step backward in comparison. I want to see my changes <i>instantly</i>, dammit, we had it in 1995, why can't we have it now? :-)",1312462791

Basically dump on the big obvious projects and then take credit for saving teacher jobs and doing minor infrastructure work all the while not mentioning where the funds came from. It's pathetic.<p>Even being a tiny chunk, the infrastructure portion has been noticeable where I live. There are two stimulus funded housing developments going up within walking distance, the Federal Court House down the block is getting a much needed retrofit, bridges are being repaired, etc etc.",1312461470

The Company believes that existing copyright law and available trade secret protections, as opposed to patent law, are better suited to protecting computer software developments.\nPatent law provides to inventors an exclusive right to new technology in return for publication of the technology. This is not appropriate for industries such as software development in which innovations occur rapidly, can be made without a substantial capital investment, and tend to be creative combinations of previously-known techniques.<p>Even if patent law were appropriate for protection of software, due to the large volume of recently-granted software patents and the rising number of new applications, the current patent process would continue to be troublesome for the software industry. Software patent examinations are hindered by the limited capability of searching prior art, by the turnover rate among examiners in the Patent and Trademark Office, and by the confusion surrounding novelty and innovation in the software arena. The problem is exacerbated by varying international patent laws, which both raise the cost and confuse the issue of patent protection.<p>Unfortunately, as a defensive strategy, Oracle has been forced to protect itself by selectively applying for patents which will present the best opportunities for cross-licensing between Oracle and other companies who may allege patent infringement.""</i><p>A statement against patenting software from no other than Oracle, before they sued Google. So in principle even they think software patents are <i>all</i> bad, but when they stand to make billions of dollars, they suddenly have a change of heart, and they want to abuse the patent system just like any other patent troll out there.<p>Why should Google be the only ones to open-source <i>all</i> their patents right now? So they can be even <i>more</i> vulnerable against other companies? Didn't they open-source Android and other companies <i>still</i> found ways to sue them? What's to stop Microsoft from suing Google on search related patents after they open source theirs? Because I'm sure Microsoft has some search patents, too, but if Google open sources theirs, how will they be able to ensure that ""mutual  -assured destruction"" balance if they don't own any patents anymore?<p>This can't be just one-sided. Either everyone loses their patents, or they keep going as it is, and try to gather as many patents as possible to ensure they don't get sued over bogus patents.<p>EDIT: And what corporation doesn't use their profits to enter a new business? Doesn't Microsoft user their <i>monopoly profits</i> as you call them, from both the OS business and the Office doc business, to throw them at the search engine business where they still lose billions of dollars?<p>Didn't they use those <i>monopoly profits</i> to enter the console market where they had to invest billions of dollars to beat even long time players such as Sony? Is that any more fair than what Google is doing?<p>What about the mobile market? They're using their monopoly profits to throw billion dollars more at that market, too, in promotions and partnerships with (once) market leaders such as Nokia.<p>It's <i>Microsoft</i> who are being the <i>pussies</i>. They are the ones trying to use any loophole in the patent system to stop Android from growing any further. Why is Microsoft being such <i>pussies</i> and using the legal system or any means necessary, moral or not, to stop Android, instead of competing in the market like everybody else?<p>It's Microsoft who are the ones crying Android is stealing their mobile business because they were 2 years late to the game, and now they try to recuperate by exploiting the patent system, instead of catching up with their own technology - you know the stuff that really matters in the end - what you have to show for yourself - not some patents on a paper.",1312461290

I live in California if it helps you find any.</i><p>You can continue to say a driver following safety suggestions to avoid getting killed by incompetent other drivers ought not be hanging out in a blind spot.  Well, sure.<p>It's a good idea to <i>not</i> taunt the robber with the gun.  At no point, however, does taunting the robber give him the right to shoot you.<p>Since you asked, here are some laws from California.<p>If a truck rear-ends a car, this law is applied against the truck:<p><i>21703.  The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon, and the condition of, the roadway.</i><p>If a car is passing a truck (through its blind spot), these laws apply to whether the car is at fault:<p><i>21750.  The driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle or a bicycle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left at a safe distance without interfering with the safe operation of the overtaken vehicle or bicycle, subject to the limitations and exceptions hereinafter stated.</i><p>The passing car maintaining its lane does not interfere with the truck's safe operation.  If the truck subsequently decides to change lanes, it now becomes the truck's responsibility to do so safely.  That does not create a sudden burden on the passing passenger car to accomodate the truck.<p><i>21752.  No vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the roadway under the following conditions:</i><p><i>(a) When approaching or upon the crest of a grade or a curve in the highway where the driver's view is obstructed within such distance as to create a hazard in the event another vehicle might approach from the opposite direction.</i><p><i>(b) When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct, or tunnel.</i><p><i>(c) When approaching within 100 feet of or when traversing any railroad grade crossing.</i><p><i>(d)When approaching within 100 feet of or when traversing any intersection.</i><p><i>This section shall not apply upon a one-way roadway.</i><p>Thanks to the last sentence, the passenger car is never forbidden from being in the lane to the left of the truck.  Again, if the truck decides to change the traffic pattern status by changing lanes, it is the truck's responsibility to be sure its lane change is safe.<p><i>21753.  Except when passing on the right is permitted, the driver of an overtaken vehicle shall safely move to the right-hand side of the highway in favor of the overtaking vehicle after an audible signal or a momentary flash of headlights by the overtaking vehicle, and shall not increase the speed of his or her vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle. This section does not require the driver of an overtaken vehicle to drive on the shoulder of the highway in order to allow the overtaking vehicle to pass.</i><p>The truck is required to give way and make it easy to pass.  This law must elude many CA truck drivers who seem to get a kick out of deliberately drifting toward a passing vehicle, crowding anyone daring to pass.<p>When coming up on a truck I flick my lights at them while I can see their mirrors.  Doesn't matter if they're traveling faster than a truck ahead of them, they are not allowed to speed up and move into my lane once I'm beside them until I'm done passing them.  Doesn't stop many from acting like they're alone on the road, but it's specifically forbidden.<p><i>Passing on the Right</i><p><i>21754.  The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass to the right of another vehicle only under the following conditions:</i><p><i>(a) When the vehicle overtaken is making or about to make a left turn.</i><p><i>(b) Upon a highway within a business or residence district with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width for two or more lines of moving vehicles in the direction of travel.</i><p><i>(c) Upon any highway outside of a business or residence district with unobstructed pavement of sufficient width and clearly marked for two or more lines of moving traffic in the direction of travel.</i><p><i>(d) Upon a one-way street.</i><p><i>(e) Upon a highway divided into two roadways where traffic is restricted to one direction upon each of such roadways.</i><p><i>The provisions of this section shall not relieve the driver of a slow moving vehicle from the duty to drive as closely as practicable to the right hand edge of the roadway.</i><p>If a truck isn't keeping to the right as is their ""duty"", a passenger car is allowed to pass them on the right.  And it's the truck driver's legal responsibility to be able to see that they are there:<p><i>26709.  (a) Every motor vehicle registered in a foreign jurisdiction and every motorcycle subject to registration in this state shall be equipped with a mirror so located as to reflect to the driver a view of the highway for a distance of at least 200 feet to the rear of such vehicle.</i><p><i>Every motor vehicle subject to registration in this state, except a motorcycle, shall be equipped with not less than two such mirrors, including one affixed to the left-hand side.</i><p><i>(b) The following described types of motor vehicles, of a type subject to registration, shall be equipped with mirrors on both the left-and right-hand sides of the vehicle so located as to reflect to the driver a view of the highway through each mirror for a distance of at least 200 feet to the rear of such vehicle:</i><p><i>(1) A motor vehicle so constructed or loaded as to obstruct the driver's view to the rear.</i><p><i>(2) A motor vehicle towing a vehicle and the towed vehicle or load thereon obstructs the driver's view to the rear.</i><p><i>(3) A bus or trolley coach.</i><p><i>(c) The provisions of subdivision (b) shall not apply to a passenger vehicle when the load obstructing the driver's view consists of passengers.</i><p>This rule applies to commercial trucks.  Technically, this rule forbids ""blind spots"".  The mirrors are required to show a continuous view of the highway from the mirror extending to 200 feet behind the vehicle.  My truck (equipped with a tow haul package) has special split towing mirrors to comply with this rule, with the top half of the mirrors normal, and the bottom half ""wide angle"" to ensure a continuous view from parallel with the front seat through the rear of the vehicle, eliminating any blind spots.<p>Finally, since you're talking about driver's manuals, for the California passenger car driver's handbook, the guidelines are: don't cut off or tailgate (these are illegal anyway, regardless of truck vs car), and don't ""linger"" when passing.  The language in this last is telling: <i>... after you pass the truck, move ahead of it. Do not linger, otherwise you make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the trucker to take evasive action if an obstacle appears in the road ahead.</i> Your being there makes it ""impossible"" for the truck to take evasive action.  Your being there does not give the truck the right to take evasive action into your lane, it makes it ""impossible"" for him, as he is not allowed to enter your lane.<p>While the driver's manual suggestions you keep citing doesn't have the force of law, here is the procedure in CA commercial driver's license (CDL) manual for what a truck driver should do before changing lanes:<p><i>Lane changes. Check your mirror to make sure no vehicle is alongside you or about to pass you. Check your mirrors:</i><p><i>- Before you change lanes to make sure there is enough room and signal at least 100 feet before turning. On the freeway, it is best to signal at least five seconds before changing lanes.</i><p><i>- After you have signaled, check to see that the lane is clear and no one has moved into your blind spot.</i><p><i>- Right after you start the lane change to double check that your path is clear.</i><p><i>- After you complete the lane change to be sure you turned off your signal lights.</i><p>If the driver's mirror has blind spots, the driver is told to be aware of vehicles moving into those blind spots, and maintain that awareness in advance of any lane changes.<p><i>Regular Checks. You need to make regular checks of your mirrors to be aware of traffic and to check your vehicle.</i><p><i>Traffic. Check the mirrors for vehicles on either side and in back of you. In an emergency, you will need to know whether you can make a quick lane change or stop. Use your mirrors to spot overtaking vehicles. Remember, there are blind spots that your mirrors cannot show you. Check your mirrors regularly to know where other vehicles are around you and to see if they move into your blind spots.</i><p>Again, the situational awareness is required of the truck driver before, and while, he initiates any traffic pattern changes.",1312460813

2845618,comment,2844059,2844059,40,0,michaelochurch,,,"Terrible writing.<p>I'll sum it up: hard working people in the bottom half of the ""top 1%"" are not evil power-brokers but the most successful professionals. You have to look at the top 0.5 or top 0.1% (I'd argue that even 0.1% is generous) before engaging ""the corridors of power"", which consists of financial and real estate elites as well as contractors exploiting corrupt government officials. Is this news?<p>A more interesting exposition might be the ruse that exists because Americans conflate these two classes of rich. It has all sorts of pernicious cultural effects. American conservatism is founded on the false belief that the $5m/year bankers are merely scaled-up versions of the $400k/year neurosurgeon who has been working hard since he was 6... when in fact, they're totally different.<p>This is fairly important if one looks at where revolutions begin. They usually start from the high end from the middle class, among people who are ""rich"" but not especially powerful. The American colonists were very wealthy, but had no clout because they were 3000 miles away from those making the decisions. The French revolutionary thought leaders were wealthy salon denizens, although far from the court at Versailles, and therefore increasingly out-of-power as the clouds darkened over France. History describes such revolutionaries, radicals, and agitators as ""middle class"" in hindsight (they're our heroes, and the U.S. associates ""middle class"" reflexively with virtue) but these people did, in fact, come overwhelmingly from the richest ~5 percent. The American ""Founding Fathers"" were downright rich. Revolutionary agitation usually comes when hard-working, intelligent, and previously fortunate people become out of power and hit a ceiling, either because society is deeply stagnant or because they're actively being deprived of autonomy. Eventually, conflict between the small, closed, social-network-based ""upper"" elite and the larger, fluid, merit-based ""upper-middle"" elite reaches a boiling point. It was this way at the end of the 18th century in America and France, and it will very likely be this way in the major conflict of the first third of the 21st century. The danger is that the conservative American has been misled into believing that the more noble elite (""elitist liberal intellectuals"") is the oppressor while the truly damaging elite is held up as the good one, as if there were <i>any</i> similarity between a $20m/year, fifth-generation-wealthy banker and ""Joe the Plumber"". There's not. But conservative Americans have been led to believe that bankers are hard-working people just like them while ""intellectuals"" are an elitist enemy oppressor. Culture is, in the U.S., slowly replacing race as the elite's favorite divide-and-conquer mechanism. American conservatism is a machine for driving a wedge between the people who are trying to save this society (""liberal intellectuals"", although neither word should be pejorative) and the common people of the country they are trying to save.<p>No news in the OP. The world is run by a morally debased and increasingly incompetent oligarchy, heavily intertwined with the banking system and with about 40% of its membership in the U.S. upper class. That was only news in 2008 to people who weren't paying attention.",1312460415

Started off first app as a side project, released on app store. Got traction and went from there. Then started releasing more apps and each of those did well also.<p>- How long did it take you to reach this point? Released first app May 2010. Quit soul-sucking BigCo Dec 2010. Started traveling the world Apr 2011. Released second app last week (both are ranked Top 5 in sports on iPhone & iPad).<p>- Was luck a big factor? (Honestly.) - I think less so than for most apps. My app is pretty niche and I knew there was a market opportunity and took it. It was definitely not just throwing something out there to see if it would stick. I knew the market and knew there was pent up demand for my product because I am part of the community.<p>- Is your revenue spread evenly across your apps, or does it follow a power curve? Does your top-selling app account for around 50% of your income? - I have 3 apps. One accounts for 50% the other 2 account for about 25% each. Each of them are considered pretty successful by app store standards (currently all Top 5 in category).<p>- How did you market / promote your apps? - Did not do any marketing. Just released it and it grew organically.<p>- How did you decide what apps to build? (Probably the most important question.) - Built something that I needed to have, and I knew others would pay for. Much easier to do this if you have other interests outside of nerd-dom. Hint: Stop reading hacker news so much and get a hobby where the majority of participants are NOT technical.<p>- Do you have a ""launch strategy""? Well, this is a bit of a cheat since I already have a pretty large userbase. But I have code in my app that notifies the user when I have a new app and links them directly to the app store. That's how I got traction for my 2nd and 3rd app. I'll give you an example of how powerful this is. When my 3rd app was released last week, iTunes rankings were broken. I did not show up AT ALL on the app store except via manual search. Despite this, I shot up all the way to #4 in spots purely on downloads from existing customers and (I suspect) word of mouth to their friends. Lesson here is to not just get customers, but get fans who will evangelize your product for you. That's probably the best advice I can give.",1312459983

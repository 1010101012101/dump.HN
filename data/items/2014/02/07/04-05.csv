Your situation is far more common.<p>A good guide for this is how the FDA manages Good Manufacturing Practice (similar to ISO 9000 except focused on, you know getting shit done instead of getting hung up on the process).  One important part is the distribution of responsibility.  They get extremely upset by situations like the one you describe specifically because of the possibility of undue influence on the results.  Manufacturing, R&D, QA and QC have to be organized to ensure proper independence.<p>(Which also means if you hear about scummy behaviour from a drug company: that flows from the top).<p>-d<p>PS: little known fact: the FDA has armed enforcement personnel who WILL storm through the door in some cases where they believe fraud could be involved in endangering people.

7194870,comment,7193921,7194822,3,0,georgemcbay,,,"&quot;I want to hear what HN thinks the minimum software developer salary should be.&quot;<p>I doubt you&#x27;ll get that from anyone, too many variables to set a minimum, IMO.<p>&quot;If a fresh grad is making $80k, then a junior developer (say 2-3 years experience) will probably be making $160k (x2), a senior developer might pull $400k (x5) or more, and beyond that you start to get into the world-famous engineers who receive whatever they ask for.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t really work like that.  I mean, sure there are articles about how Google pays $3 million or whatever to keep a top developer, but if you read past the headline you see it isn&#x27;t salary, mostly one-time RSUs or such and the person is actually more of a project manager or even executive rather than a developer.  The industry&#x27;s issues with compensation extend up into the higher end too where there&#x27;s somewhat of a loose glass ceiling at around $150k-175k or so (which can vary quite a bit based on region/cost of living, but the general idea of a glass cap is pretty universal) beyond which it is very difficult to go without being a Linus-level name brand, or going into management or founding your own company and hitting the startup lottery.  Of course there are exceptions to this that prove the rule, like people doing HFT/financial software can make quite a bit more because they are compensated like financial sector workers instead of like software industry workers.<p>&quot;Years of experience is useful as a rough approximation of value, because someone who is not constantly improving their skillset is unlikely to be promoted and will eventually leave their position for greener pastures.&quot;<p>As someone who is 40 and still an active non-managerial software developer, I should find this somewhat flattering, but I&#x27;ve seen plenty of evidence that suggests you are simply incredibly optimistic about the efficiency of the industry at weeding out those who aren&#x27;t productive or talented.",1391748732

Their ultimate contribution to what we can do with our devices in terms of novelty is going to be incredibly marginal.<p>Along the same lines, I think Apple has harmed the long term success for tablets by refusing to embrace a stylus (I seem to remember &quot;if you see a stylus you failed&quot; type remark?). After acquiring a Note 3 it truly transforms the device - it&#x27;s the &quot;other half&quot; of interaction that I have been missing. I could never bring myself to type on a tablet in a meeting. Whether it&#x27;s just a social construct or not, I don&#x27;t know - but I can write without feeling rude, but not type. So many things I can sketch out with the &quot;real&quot; stylus but could never do with a capacitive version. I have realized that my Note3 is the perfect device for doing math. I mark up PDFs. I pull it out any time I need more accuracy than the touch interface will provide. I&#x27;m seriously contemplating now buying an 8&quot; note just for the stylus function.",1391748471

If there&#x27;s a demographic group with an elevated risk of offending, we want to dedicate screening to it until it has only the baseline risk.  Even if that raises the baseline risk, it&#x27;s a win for us.<p>With all that in mind, screening a particular group at a 0% rate won&#x27;t get you there.

If I were to open a shoe factory, I would learn all about making shoes. I would make a few shoes of my own. I would make sure that I knew everything that goes into making a shoe. Especially if I need to hire shoemakers, how else would I know if they are any good?<p>> Developers can smell a non-technical founder from miles away. It tells them that you have zero respect for what they do, and you think they are just tools.  The Twitter book by Nick Bilton mentioned no developers. Somehow that company was built with no developers. Your developers don’t want that to happen to them, and if you don’t care enough about what your company produces to learn how it works that’s the message you’re sending.<p>Funny. The most attractive and profitable opportunities I have ever been presented with involved non-technical individuals with domain expertise and strong relationships in their market. They didn&#x27;t unnecessarily pretend that they were something they weren&#x27;t (read: a techie), and they didn&#x27;t act like I was a god just because I knew how to code.<p>They had spotted an interesting, potentially lucrative opportunity that required a website/web application and they were looking for a qualified <i>partner</i> who could help them exploit it.<p>What boggles my mind is the number of &quot;startups&quot;, most of them consumer focused, with:<p>1. A basic CRUD app.<p>2. A track record of &quot;pre-traction&quot; (read: modest usage/traffic <i>at best</i>).<p>3. Too many developers on staff using way too many [programming languages/frameworks/technologies]. You know, because it&#x27;s cool to overengineer and prematurely optimize real-time distributed architectures, and stuff.<p>4. Compensation packages and office space that look great assuming you don&#x27;t perform the burn rate math, which doesn&#x27;t really matter. Unless you want to know how long your salary will last and your key to the office will work. And who wants to know that?<p>5. The mistaken belief that their employees don&#x27;t have a social life of their own. You know, because everyone knows the best developers don&#x27;t have friends.<p>6. The delusion that their use of AWS makes them a &quot;technology company.&quot; You know, because that&#x27;s more fashionable than calling your web-based staffing agency for animal trainers a staffing agency.<p>The OP is right. There is no shortage of developers. But she&#x27;s wrong about why so many companies can&#x27;t seem to recruit them. These companies are not looking for developers. They&#x27;re looking for developers who have more experience and skill than their &quot;businesses&quot; require <i>and</i> who also happen to be suckers.

No matter how desperate they are, they still need you to be crawling to them, not vice versa.<p>Sometimes an outside headhunter calls me and asks if I want to talk to a company.  I call and talk to someone at the company, and before I&#x27;ve even met anyone they want three references from me, preferably (or absolutely) former bosses.  So before I even meet anyone, I&#x27;m supposed to call three former bosses and ask them all for a favor.<p>It might happen a little farther down the process, but still.  What it really means for me is I don&#x27;t do &quot;one off&quot; interviews.  Every few years or so I decide to get a new job, I fix my resume etc., ask my former bosses if they&#x27;d give me a recommendation, and then start interviewing at lots of companies.  What this means is I&#x27;m only available for several weeks every few years.  It wouldn&#x27;t be a big thing for me to check out some new company half-way into my employment somewhere, but I&#x27;m not going to bother my old bosses every few months for one-off interviews.  And why bother going and stammering in front of some officious HR person or manager about how you don&#x27;t feel comfortable giving out recommendations so early on.  Their expectations already turn the interview sour, &quot;what am I hiding&quot;?<p>Then interviewers also expect you to work on their schedule.  I have a job, things aren&#x27;t going well there, yet they expect me to come in the middle of a work day and spend some hours there.  I might even take the day off and the interviewer might call and cancel.  Then should I wear a suit (I&#x27;m not in the Bay Area)?  I used to drop my suit off in a friend&#x27;s office, go to work, go to my friend&#x27;s office, get in the suit, interview, go back to my friend&#x27;s office, change, go back to work, then go to my friend&#x27;s office, get the suit and go home.<p>Or the interviewer asks very officiously why I want to work at the company.  The answer I usually want to give is that I don&#x27;t necessarily want to, someone called and asked if I was interested so I&#x27;m checking it out.  But if an outside headhunter asked me to, it sounds kind of hollow.  Blog posts with tips on interviewing say I should have a set BS answer for this but why should I?  I want to work there for a fucking paycheck, why do you think I want to work there?<p>Then other bullshit.  Obviously I wouldn&#x27;t badmouth people at my current or former employers.  But if they ask me about the process at my current job and I&#x27;m honest about how fucked up it is it becomes my fault.  Let&#x27;s say I said we have no revision control, no staging servers, everything goes straight into production, no code reviews, no integration tests etc.  Or maybe not that bad, but whatever.  Or the company won&#x27;t spend money to hire the amount of personnel they need, the machines they need, the software they need, whatever.  Then they say why not?  I say I&#x27;ve asked management and management said no.  It becomes my fault when I&#x27;m honest and say I couldn&#x27;t shake the pennies from management to set up a proper system.  Even if I&#x27;m just a lowly developer and not even a team lead or something.<p>Then there&#x27;s the requirements.  BSCS from a good school required.  A few classes short and lots of experience?  Tough luck.  Or super-specific requirements for a number of technologies, all at a high level and for many years.  Often for a crappy company, a crappy position that doesn&#x27;t need anywhere near that kind of experience.  Sometimes there will be a posting on some tech forum where people are laughing about a Craigslist posting asking for &quot;9 years of experience with iPhone apps&quot;.  It kind of drives home the point.  Nowadays I usually don&#x27;t even have the experience problem, but it&#x27;s ridiculous when a requirement is for their version control system or something.  I mean, how long would it really take me to learn perforce if I know subversion, git etc., as well as all the other job listing requirements?<p>Companies make the interview process unpleasant, throw up all kinds of barriers and then wonder why they can&#x27;t find good candidates.<p>They also wonder why person to person recruiting is so effective, people bringing in people they know.  The reason is because the inside person usually tells me &quot;the job is yours if you want it&quot;.  Most of my jobs have been gotten this way, I&#x27;ve only worked at two companies where I went in cold via a headhunter.  It&#x27;s just too unpleasant.",1391745965

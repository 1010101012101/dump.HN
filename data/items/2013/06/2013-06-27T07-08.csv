5951145,comment,5950497,5950497,1,0,Tichy,,,"I think one problem is that we tend to think about this in terms of willpower. To be awesome, all we have to do is really want it and work really hard, right?
I suspect in reality it is much more about habits. Example: write a book by writing 2 hours every day, no matter what.
Finish what you start? (Not sure if that is actually a good idea)
If you have started one company, starting other companies will probably come much more natural to you.
Or Aaron Swartz&#x27;s &quot;always say yes to everything&quot;.
Little things like that.
Of course you still need to find the right habits.
I&#x27;m currently reading &quot;The Luck Factor&quot; and it also comes down to making a habit out of meeting more people and making new experiences - it&#x27;s all a numbers game.",1372319927

I have periodically observed that There are many common but essential requirements for most real-world web applications that aren&#x27;t served well. Like action-based and resource (entity record) aware authorization. ASK handles all such must-to-have requirements pretty transparently and is highly flexible. This is because it&#x27;s been developped and actively improved as a basis of many consultancy projects I have undertaken over the years.<p>It has also many nice-to-have things and many more things planned.

If you strive for success it always feels as if there&#x27;s a long way there, no matter how far you get. You can rarely see the best way forward because it&#x27;s mostly depending on chance.<p>But if you strive for creating value you can start in an instant, by just being helpful to someone or (in the case of being a tech entrepreneur) building a small web service that you know that a handful of people find valuable.<p>With time, striving for creating value will take you on a straighter path to success than if you were aiming for success all along the way.",1372319769

5951139,comment,5950031,5950361,1,0,socillion,,,"I used Pandora continuously for several years, and I think it&#x27;s fundamental value proposition is that it lets you discover new music. If you know what you want to listen to already, Pandora is an extraordinarily poor option because it gives you little latitude to listen to those specific tracks. I see it as entirely incomparable to purchasing an indefinite license to play a song or album.<p>In many ways it is identical to radio, including solving the same problem - &quot;give me a kind of music that I can enjoy&quot;. Instead of listening to something vague and poorly defined like a Metal channel on the radio, you&#x27;re listening to a genre as defined by Pandora&#x27;s much more nuanced song trait maps. Like radio, the service limits the amount that a single artist is played - you&#x27;re unlikely to hear more than 1-3 songs by the same artist. You also have no ability to rewind and listen again.<p>As a discovery tool like radio, Pandora also has positive externalities that are not demonstrated by simple royalty payments. Ff you enjoy an artist enough, you&#x27;re likely to purchase their music (or just find it on Youtube) either because you want to hear more of their music, or simply because you want direct control over when you listen to that song.",1372319726

A FISA order really is a warrant in the legal sense, so it&#x27;s not a misnomer. There&#x27;s no substantiated evidence that the government is failing to comply with its legal obligations under FISA and other relevant laws here.<p>Er, um, no. FISA warrants and courts are different than regular warrants and courts for a very good reason. Most of them are issued post de-facto and as mtgx and I have pointed out, are literally rubber stamped. ZERO were declined last year.<p>I&#x27;d love a citation for the last sentence of your post. I&#x27;ll work on background info on FISA warrants. Like I said, wish I had my debate evidence I cut years ago. Rather ironically, it&#x27;s actually remarkably hard to refind some of that evidence 10 years later. Google loves to emphasize more recent publications.<p>A FISA warrant is as much a warrant as an FBI agent wiping their ass on a piece of paper and calling it a National Security Letter makes it a &quot;legal warrant&quot;.

Before 9/11, FISA warrants were also used to compel US companies to comply with collection against non US persons for which they were the carrier. At some point after 9/11 the Bush administration realized the law could be reasonably interpreted as not strictly requiring this, so they stopped using FISA for this purpose. That was the heart of the warrantless wiretapping controversy, and the primary goal of the FISA Amendments Act was to add requirements and oversight for these situations.",1372319319

I think being comfortable with who you are is important. Recognising what you have already got and appreciating it is important. Ambition is something that people do when they are trying to find happiness and to be comfortable with who they are. 
I think it all comes down to one&#x27;s approach to everything. Its good to have ambition, especially if its directed in the correct way. I would say on here, that an ambition to learn, create, inspire and make a difference is what most folks apsire to do...",1372318346

5951090,comment,5950497,5950497,8,0,oyvindeh,,,"I attended a talk given by a Buddhist monk named Ajahn Brahm about a year ago. He said that 70% is always good enough. The reasoning goes that if you strive for 100% (or 110%, like some brag about doing) you will very often disappoint yourself (as well as those around you). If you go for 50%, you won&#x27;t be motivated enough. So 70% seems about right. (There is a Youtube video of him talking about this subject [1].)<p>There is tendency today that everybody wants to accomplish so much. I know this from myself: Compared with many of my friends, I have accomplished quite a lot - but it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me, I need more to be happy. I agree with the author that we should focus more on just being. Because, if you think of it, what happens when you have accomplished whatever you had aimed for? It feels great... for a little while. Then, life is back to normal. We often believe the fallacy that happiness is available somewhere in the future, not here and now, and once we get this or that - THEN we will be happy[2]. And so you risk rigging your life in order to always reach for the next mountain top you have in sight, thinking that it&#x27;s the final one.<p>An Australian nurse interviewed people on their death bed about their regrets in life[3]. The second biggest regret was that people had worked too hard.<p>Think about the real motives for what you do: If you do something to prove yourself for others (e.g. fame and glory), you&#x27;re fooling yourself. First of all because it will most likely not make you happy, second because you will be forgotten anyway (especially today when everybody claims their 15 minutes of fame). If you strive for something because you think it will make you more happy, you are fooling yourself to believe that happiness is somewhere in the future and not available now.<p>On the other hand, if the road is the goal, you are more likely rigging your life for lasting happiness. In the end, what is the use of accomplishing things if you are, and continue to be, unhappy?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6k6DMp1TxQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6k6DMp1TxQ</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixRISCK7pmE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixRISCK7pmE</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-...</a>",1372318188

That&#x27;s a fundamental design flaw in the intended behaviour, not an accidental coding error.  They gave the profile ID to reset to the client when serving the page, and then blindly used whatever profile ID the client sent when submitting the form.  The fix was to fetch the profile ID for the authenticated user instead of sending a profile ID on a round-trip through the client.<p>I certainly agree that the problem wasn&#x27;t the technology here, but I disagree with your conclusion.  &quot;some if missing somewhere&quot; is far easier to avoid technologically than a high-level design flaw like this.  It&#x27;s fairly easy for a type system to notice that not all cases in a conditional are accounted for, but it&#x27;s much harder for a type system to understand that it&#x27;s inappropriate to use client-submitted data as a profile ID for a password reset request (as opposed to operations like submitting a friend request, where it&#x27;s perfectly valid).",1372318122

Also not every case filed will go all of the way through to a decision, so you can file multiple cases then actually litigate the one that wound up in front of the judge that you want.  (There are safeguards against that.  They are imperfect...)<p>Furthermore while in theory judges have to follow precedent and case law, in practice there are lots of cases where well-meaning and dedicated judges, presented with the same facts, precedent, and case law, will come to opposite conclusion.  Were it otherwise, the Supreme Court would never have dissenting opinions.<p>Finally, courts do have the right to request that the arguments that they wish to hear about particular points of law be made in front of them.  For example in proposition 8, the justices required that the standing argument be made, even though neither side wanted to advance it.  In the Affordable Healthcare Act this went further.  An attorney, Robert Long, wound up having to be appointed specifically to make the case to the Supreme Court for a point that neither side wished to argue.  That point being  that the law was a tax, and therefore under the Anti-Injunction Act no lawsuit could be brought about it until after someone had been injured by actually paying it.<p>That last point matters in this case.  The state actively did not want to defend this case in front of the district court.  The judge wanted it defended.

Also kind of scary. I knew musicians had a hard time of it, but I&#x27;ve never seen the numbers crunched like that.<p>As a semi-relevant aside, my girlfriend works on Broadway and frequently tells me about the actors/actresses she meets. There are well-known stars who make between $10-20 thousand per contract (which may last about 6 months, commonly) despite having a leading role. I suppose it&#x27;s similar to the music industry - only a privileged few ever make it to what an engineer would call &quot;starting salary&quot; and only a handful ever get rich (comparatively).<p>It&#x27;s saddening that the arts are so monetarily difficult. I have a deep appreciation for music, theatre and film but the constituents really get shafted.",1372316759

Many of Objective-C&#x27;s interesting features have this problem that either they&#x27;re too magical, have an odd syntax or are leaky abstractions due to the limitations of backward compatibility.",1372316756

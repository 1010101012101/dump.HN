Video cards are something of a special case because they are highly redundant so companies can sell highly damaged chips as slightly different models.  However,  demand rarely matches the rate of defects so often chips are sold below capacity.<p>What confuses the issue is 'pro' cards that may preform worse than 'gamer' cards, but cost a lot more.  However, that's more a case of different needs.  Consider, stability is a lot more important to the 'pro' market which down clocking provides.

If you hold a currency that keeps gaining value, then your purchasing power keeps increasing. Why is that a bad thing?<p>> It is bad for several reasons. The easiest to grasp is that people tend to keep their money in their hands (hoarding) if that money is acquiring value by itself. If people don't spend their money, or lend it, the economy suffers.<p>What I have never understood about this argument is people can't eat money, they can't sleep under it, they can't do any number of things with it. What they can do is buy things, like food, which allow them to do the things they desire. Having a deflationary currency is pro-citizen, it is pro-poor, and pro-middle class.<p>These classes are primarily uninterested in ""investing."" What they are interested in is saving. Saving to go to college, to buy better accommodations, to go on a vacation, to stop working two jobs, etc... They have no interest in complex inflation protection vehicles.<p>You may say: you are being silly, you don't understand how the financial system works! Maybe I don't, but neither does a large percentage of the population. Shouldn't our default policy always be about protecting those most vulnerable? Those most likely to be exploited?

Their goal is to get not only the original uploaders paying to keep their files online, but also some percentage of downloaders as well.  That's why sites like this have countdown timers, bandwidth limits and waiting periods.  They're hoping that people will get so sick of the bullshit trying to download your files that they'll spring for a premium subscription.<p>This is why they've had such an interesting relationship with copyright infringement.  Obviously, they want to avoid getting shut down - but people uploading TV shows, games, music, movies, etc on places like DDL forums drive so much traffic and so many premium memberships that their business model almost depends on them.<p>Some of them even pay dividends to the popular uploaders, as a thank you for driving traffic.  This drives an entire underground economy, where people upload copyrighted content to file lockers, then use the payments from the file locker service to buy more content to upload.<p>Edit: One example of this kind of underground economy is in the anime fansubbing community.  You've got people who want to widely distribute 200-500mb files (generally) that are... not entirely free of copyright, to say the least.  Hosting the files yourself would be a pain, as you'd get takedown notices AND have to pay for servers and bandwidth.  However, you can upload your episodes to a couple file locker services and post the links on your site.  You'll get a kickback from the file lockers for driving traffic, and if they get taken down, you can just reupload them, possibly even at the same site.  The fansub groups say they use the money to pay for hosting and buy Blu-rays to rip and release, but I'm sure some of them pocket some as a salary too.",1363700216

5400730,comment,5400087,5400087,17,0,Irregardless,,,"> Eating fewer grain products is not synonymous with popular diets like low-carb or gluten-free. It neednt be borne by commitment to a food movement like paleo.<p>Sure, it doesn't <i>need</i> to be related to the Paleo diet, but that's still where it all stems from. It's the same as any other fad diet or pseudoscience: Come up with some reasonable-sounding claims that take advantage of poor scientific awareness (e.g. <i>10,000 years isn't enough time for humans to adapt to eating grains, so we should eat like cave men instead</i>), then make millions of dollars promoting your diet and selling books to your unquestioning followers.<p>There's a common sentiment among Paleo zealots that they finally need to distance themselves from the irrational underpinnings that started the whole fad (see here[1] for a FAQ by the 'Paleo diet' inventor). The problem arises when they go searching for scientific evidence to support their grain bashing, and then we end up with statements like this:<p>> It can stem from the simple proposition that fruits and vegetables are generally healthier to eat than grains. Thats an argument Ill cover more deeply in later posts.<p>Oh, how convenient. Save the crux of the argument for another time. We'll all be patiently holding our breath.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thepaleodiet.com/paleo-diet-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepaleodiet.com/paleo-diet-faq/</a>",1363699945

In practice, it did exactly what I wanted and I wasn't using it much, so I never put much thought to it. Then it started going into an infinite loop in some cases. Troublesome.<p>So, I'd get it to go into an infinite loop, I'd attach the debugger, and... it'd leave the infinite loop. What?<p>Hm, identify the arguments that produce the infinite loop (good ol' printf debugging!) and reproduce those in an isolated test case. Great, test case enters an infinite loop, let's attach the debugger... hey, what? It's not failing anymore.<p>As it turns out, the default behavior for attaching a debugger to a .NET executable includes having the JIT deoptimize some of your method bodies in order to make breakpoints and local variables easier to work with (in their wisdom, MS did include an option to turn this off) - so any time I ran the test case under a debugger, it passed, because deoptimizing the method had caused the floating point math to flush to 32-bit float representation more often, truncating the additional precision. The infinite loop ended up being caused by that additional precision!<p>Best of all, the other platform I was writing the code for at the time (PowerPC) didn't exhibit the bug, because its floating-point implementation doesn't add additional precision.",1363699492

5400613,comment,5393864,5395690,2,0,rlx0x,,,"Sure, let me try by comparing it to the competition: the firefox devtools, firebug and opera inspector (I haven't used anything else). I'm using the chrome devtools for DOM inspection (HTML and SVG), CSS development and debugging, javascript repl and debugging (and via node-inspector also for server-side debugging) and HTTP profiling and protocol debugging. So I'm using it primarily for web development but its also an invaluable tool for web scraping where you can just copy&paste xpath expressions from the dom inspector for instance.<p><i>The Opera Developer Tools (Opera Dragonfly)</i>: The UX is done well, the markup editor works even better than in chrome and I like the screenshot utility and color picker. The css inspection is inconvenient when you want to change properties or add new rules. The network log is done well but the UX can become confusing, the make request feature is exceptional I don't know any other devtool that has that integrated. No xpath in the dom inspector.<p><i>Firebug</i>: This was the first browser devtool afaik so it has a long history and years of development behind it, I always considered it to be ""the firefox developer tools"" and I was really surprised when mozilla announced they would recreate it on their own instead of just integrating firebug. But I guess they have their reasons.<p>Firebug has a great UX, everything is fast and polished although it has become a little old, it still integrates nicely in the current firefox UI. The dom and css inspector is great, it allows to quickly change anything you ever want, with the exception maybe that you cannot add new css rules (only element styles). The network inspector is exceptional, best of all 4. I don't like the console/REPL but its alright. Overall still my second favorite.<p><i>Chrome Developer Tools</i>: Provides by far the best UX and is clearly the most powerful devtool around. Its also the only reason why I have chrome installed, my main browser is and was always firefox. The css inspector is just great, you can update or add new rules and properties and it has great auto completion. I don't like the dom editor through, the edit as html feature lacks a bit. Javascript debugging and the console work exceptionally well and you can even edit and save your code within the devtools. It has HTML5 builtin features for web workers, indexedDB, local storage, etc. You also can use it to debug nodejs applications through node-inspector.<p><i>Firefox Developer Tools</i>: I must admit, I don't even know where to begin. The UX is just awful: From the alien dark-blue that doesn't integrate at all with the rest of firefox and the font sizes that you can't change to the strange dropdown menu/button combinations in the latest version. The DOM inspector doesn't allow you to edit html directly, has no xpath and the css inspector is confusing and doesn't has autocompletion. There is no resources overview, no networking debugging and profiling.\nI do however acknowledge there is some progress in the latest snapshots, I like the scratchpad, style editor and the UI overhaul made it a bit more usable. There are still no settings, still no way to change the dark theme. I don't say it isn't making some progress, but its so slow (they say they need a few months for the python api alone), that chrome will have progressed well beyond and I don't see them catching up.",1363698616

Instead of doing the pleasant thing, and making contracts that stay within in the bounds they are allowed by law, companies started claiming that every portion of every contract was severable.<p>What this means is that they can throw <i>any</i> kind of crap in there, whether they could actually invoke it or not. Add that to the fact that the majority of the population of the US doesn't even read the contracts they sign (seriously, they don't), and companies are incentivized to throw the kitchen sink into their documents, and leave the decisions about what is enforceable until later.<p>Specifically, the region of your work that they can claim ip rights over is tightly limited by the definition of 'work for hire', regardless of what they try to claim in your contract.",1363698503

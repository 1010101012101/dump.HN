Cool!  2) Having a name for a phenomena does not mean that the phenomena actually exists.  and 3) It's hard to see that this is ""more rigorous"".  I was trying to point out that your (highly upvoted) comment didn't actually include any references, citations, or facts, although it appeared to.  It also seemed to be a (very well written) variation on the ""some people say..."" mode of rhetoric, which was further enhanced with a very authoritative tone.<p>I don't think it becomes an ontological or epistemological discussion to query for additional sources/evidence/data.  I was trying to courteously say ""hey, that statement had no sources"", especially because i don't believe that this is a very common phenomenon.  I will do so more bluntly next time.<p>That said, your state legislators are some of the lowest paid public servants there are (<a href=""http://www.empirecenter.org/html/legislative_salaries.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.empirecenter.org/html/legislative_salaries.cfm</a>).

Given that sending emails from a web server is often necessary, I need a way to send emails from the web server. I was using the Google Apps SMTP server for this until our website had enough users that we passed the Google Apps daily email limit. So now I'm looking for an alternative way to send emails. I'm sure many other YC News readers have encountered this... any suggestions?<p>Clarification: I don't mean email marketing services like ConstantContact.com but rather mail servers that can be used directly from our web server to send email notifications.",1265253046

Your code needs to determine if the object which will get returned as JSON by that web service implements the method or not.</i><p>You wouldn't do that by reflection, you'd have a mapping between service method names and objects that perform the service. In fact, this sort of thing is pretty typical in web frameworks based on dynamic languages as well. I don't want you calling Object.notifyAll or whatever just by fiddling with urls. Reflection does come up but it's usually in more magical places -  serialization (the built-in serialization is an example of interface-by-convention), profilers, debuggers, prototyping tools.",1265253024

The challenge is making sure thugs with guns don't take it between the place where it is produced and the place where it is consumed.  (It matters little to this analysis whether the thugs with guns are cops or robbers, since if you live in a country with famine they are probably only distinguishable by the color of their uniforms, if that.)",1265252776

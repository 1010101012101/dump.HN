9865143,comment,9861793,9862432,0,0,tedks,,,"> I wonder how many of the people on that think of the children side were either affected as kids, had children who had some awful experience, or are of close relation to someone who was or had kids who did. Because I could easily see something like an awful event happening to a child really warping a persons world view in a strong way.<p>I know more than a few people who were abused as children, but none of them have become think-of-the-children anti-privacy advocates. It&#x27;s probable that it&#x27;s a selection effect, since the prior for my knowing someone who disagrees with my politics so deeply well enough to know their abuse history is low. But at the same time, I&#x27;d expect to run into at least one person by now.<p>I think that most people with first-hand experience around child abuse are probably not anti-privacy advocates. At that level it becomes clear that the real problems are social conventions that adults can exploit (family and professional relationships with defined subordinate roles for children), enabling them to commit abuse. Having secure communications doesn&#x27;t help with this much. In fact, if a child thought they could tell someone about abuse without their abuser knowing, it might be helpful.<p>I think that the anti-privacy activists are actually people who are rather far away from the societal evils they claim to oppose privacy to protect against. The people who have opinions about the NSA reading email or encrypted messaging tend not to be personally affected by social instability from terrorism, or the drug war, just by basic socioeconomics. Child molestation is probably a similar, far-off evil. It&#x27;s enough for these people that these systems <i>could</i> hide evildoing, and because of that they clearly need to be compromised so that the state and legitimate community forces can hunt evildoers. I think the real motive is simply a naive belief in the goodwill of those community forces.<p>This in turn can be explained by a naive moral system, where it is moral to obey rules. This is the 3rd or 4th level of the Kohlberg moral development scale, and the level Kohlberg conjectured most people remain at during their lives.

(I am including rational, mathematical, or logical arguments based on experimental evidence as evidence here)&quot;<p>I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re discussing this because you&#x27;re an example of the kind of thinking that is a mystery to me.<p>The fact that I have qualia when looking at, for example, the color yellow, is directly knowable by means of just a little introspection. This is not &quot;rational, mathematical, or logical&quot; or based on &quot;experimental evidence&quot;. It is simply direct observation. Observation is where the scientific processes you name start. Observation does not depend on those processes. They depend on it and build from it. Observations are the most fundamental thing.<p>From the direct observation of your experience of yellowness, which I think you must agree is something more than merely classifying the wavelength as being in a certain range, I would think you would know that qualia exist. That is enough evidence.<p>&quot;How do we decide what the actual answer is? Science and materialism have repeatedly produced predictions that pan out in experiments. Theories of souls and sprituality have repeatedly had to retreat from testable predictions.&quot;<p>So, let&#x27;s not have a theory of souls or spirituality at this point. We don&#x27;t know enough. That doesn&#x27;t mean that those things don&#x27;t exist, it only means we don&#x27;t understand them.<p>Suppose a cave man-level creature on another planet encounters an iPhone because we somehow send one there. This cave man creature knows how to build fires and has used reasoning to make weapons, etc. In doing those things, he probably tried different ideas about how best to make fires and rejected the ones that didn&#x27;t work well. In other words, he has a rudimentary understanding of the scientific method.<p>Now he tries to figure out how an iPhone works. He constructs theories based on what he knows. The theories are all shown, over hundreds of years, to be wrong. Therefore, he is told, iPhones don&#x27;t exist because when he constructs theories about them, they are wrong.<p>But he directly observes the existence of the iPhone because he holds it in his hand. He knows they exist. He doesn&#x27;t need a scientific theory to prove that they exist. Maybe, eventually, he will have a correct scientific theory as to how they work; it will just take more time. Or maybe he never will. Either way, iPhones exist.<p>Awareness is, in my view, exactly the same, and it is mystifying to me that people such as yourself come to a different conclusion.",1436547299

In particular, there have been a lot of successes in generating programs from input/output examples, provided the domain is sufficiently restrictive and/or the programmer provides a &quot;sketch&quot; or partial program to start off the synthesizer with. One good paper to start looking at is: Oracle guided program synthesis, Jha and others ICSE&#x27;10. This algorithm has made its way into Microsoft Excel: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/flashfill-020613.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/flashfill-...</a>.<p>You might argue this isn&#x27;t &quot;true&quot; program synthesis, but in some cases it can outdo human programs, because the synthesizer can be tied into a verifier to produce only &quot;correct&quot; programs, where correctness is defined by a few simple and declarative properties. One example of this sort of thing is from Udupa and colleagues in PLDI&#x27;13: <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2462156.2462174"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2462156.2462174</a>.

This is a big improvement over the current state of the art, where a lot of very smart people think really hard and come up with a coherence protocol, convince themselves it&#x27;s correct, and then some other very smart people spend a few months playing with automated verifiers trying to prove the protocol correct, and finally someone actually implements the protocol in hardware, and you might still run into bugs at this stage.",1436546940

They&#x27;ll judge all of your choices against your income; if you buy something that&#x27;s a bit of a stretch, like a nicer car, you may get lectured on, but you&#x27;ll definitely get judged on, how you can&#x27;t really afford that, or how you&#x27;re terrible at managing your income, etc.<p>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Publicized salary information makes personal interactions more difficult all around.<p>It can make business more difficult. Consider a world where everyone&#x27;s salary is public, and anyone selling you a product can look up your income and demand certain payment based on a percentage of your income. It&#x27;d be a lot harder to negotiate or deal with salespeople this way.<p>&quot;Salary history&quot; is one of the HR department&#x27;s great tools for screwing over employees; instead of paying you a salary commensurate with the value you bring to the company, they just have to offer a marginal bump. Again, it neuters negotiation, since they know your hand ahead of time.<p>There can be legal ramifications. Consider a situation where you get in a car accident, exchange insurance information, and the other party looks up your salary online and discovers that you make enough to be worth bringing to court. Even if he&#x27;d lose the case, and even if it&#x27;s small claims, it&#x27;d cost you time and money in transportation, time off, etc. If it&#x27;s not small claims, it&#x27;d cost you legal fees too. The claimant would anticipate that your lawyer would recommend a settlement and may sue even if his prospects were poor; since your income information would be public, said lawyers would take your case on contingency, since you have enough money to be worth trying to wring out.<p>The old saying &quot;good fences make good neighbors&quot; applies and can be generalized as &quot;a reasonable amount of privacy keeps people civil&quot; (it needn&#x27;t refer exclusively to fences). Your personal affairs can and should stay personal.",1436546656

9865042,comment,9859156,9864452,0,0,jecxjo,,,"I grew up in Wisconsin and went to college in Iowa and the one thing I noticed between the two was how horrible the Iowa DOT was.<p>In Wisconsin we know that every year there will be snow. Lots and lots of snow. In 18 years of living there I never once remember a time where there was more than half a day of our rural road not being plowed. I remember seeing plows driving around when there was no snow falling because they knew it was coming and as soon as the first flake hit the ground the buckets went down.<p>In Iowa, ever year there were multiple times when I&#x27;d be stuck at home, unable to get to school or work because the roads weren&#x27;t plowed. Major Highways! I&#x27;d call the DOT and their response was &quot;we are just waiting until the snow stops so we don&#x27;t have to plow multiple times.&quot; This was their response in the afternoon having not plowed all morning. One year they ran out of salt for the roads and had to use expired Seasoning Salt from a local manufacturer. Everyone complained because their car smelled like Garlic Bread. No one seemed to care about the fact that Iowa is in the Midwest and for some strange reason the people running the DOT didn&#x27;t think to have adequate supplies.<p>Wisconsin has a huge vacation market. A large amount of road usage is by people traveling from out of state up to the north woods for hunting, fishing, camping, etc. Iowa does not have this type of road usage.<p>Iowa has two main highways. Hwy 80 is a shipping lane that connects Chicago to the western half of the US. Hwy 35 is a north south route going from Minneapolis/St. Paul all the way down to Austin Texas and connects a lot of major cities along the way.<p>Hwy 80 (and hwy 88) are used so much in Illinois that Illinois actually charges you a toll to use it. Iowa has the same traffic on 80 but does not charge a toll. One state has figured out how to pay for their road usage while the other has not. THIS is the real issue with why Iowa&#x27;s DOT can&#x27;t do anything right. They spend money in the wrong places, don&#x27;t get enough income to pay for things they should and for some strange reason don&#x27;t understand that they have a problem.",1436546497

What if we&#x27;re all just pretending and you&#x27;re the only one?&quot;<p>To me, that&#x27;s kind of a silly question. Yes, it might be true. Of course, it might be that there are no other human beings and I&#x27;m just a brain in a vat. I just find that hypothesis to be too unlikely to care about.<p>&quot;We&#x27;re just putting together lego blocks and at the end is a human indistinguishable from any other human.\nDoes this person experience qualia?&quot;<p>I would guess so.<p>&quot;How would you know?&quot; For me, this is a little like your first question. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily know. But if this entity is physically indistinguishable from a human at even the most infinitesimal level of physical reality, I&#x27;d assume it experiences.<p>But, I may be wrong here, because it might be that there is something non-physical called a &quot;soul&quot; that resides in humans, and a physically identical entity might not be provided with one by God or whoever/whatever the soul-provider is. That&#x27;s not what I tend to assume, but I have no evidence either way.<p>Your question &quot;How would you know&quot; is an interesting one because it assumes that it matters whether or not an observer knows. Maybe some entities have awareness and others don&#x27;t, and an observer can&#x27;t tell the difference. So what? That wouldn&#x27;t imply, in any way, that the phenomenon of awareness doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&quot;Once you take apart the argument like this, it&#x27;s easy to see that arguments that computers can&#x27;t experience qualia are arguments against materialism or reductionism, or are patent attempts to sneak souls and other woo into the discussion.&quot;<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that such arguments/hypotheses aren&#x27;t true. It just means they may not be testable using the scientific method. Much as many people don&#x27;t like the multiverse theory because it may not be testable using the scientific method. But that merely means that there are limits to the truths that can be discovered by the scientific method; it doesn&#x27;t change the reality of what is true.<p>It&#x27;s a bit reminiscent of Godel&#x27;s completeness theorem. Many great mathematicians assumed that there were no truths that weren&#x27;t provable within the systems they were studying; Godel proved that such assumptions were simply wrong.",1436546368

That&#x27;s because &quot;observing&quot; is just a description of a bunch of particles interacting with each other. Some of those particles are part of a larger pattern of particles we call human brains. There&#x27;s nothing particularly unique about our brains in terms of physics.<p>At a higher level, we can look at the interactions between our brains and the environment and think about brains as a different kind of thing. A pattern recognizer, a prediction maker, an effective evolutionary adaptation that leads to the propagation of the genes that create it. But there&#x27;s no reason to suspect it creates universes.<p>I absolutely agree that a lot about our brains is mysterious and there are a lot of questions that need answers. The next few decades are going to be very interesting as we discover many of those secrets.

Humans are a necessary element of biological contagion.<p>You couldn&#x27;t get voluntary, informed consent from the inhabitants of an actual city, because behavioral patterns might change in response to the knowledge that the test was being conducted, and a lot of people would refuse to participate.  Public knowledge of the test would screw up the test and make the results unreliable.<p>So there&#x27;s no way to ethically perform such an experiment.  But many soldiers also consider it their ethical imperative to protect the civilian populations of their country as well as they are able.  Therefore, the rationale would be that in order to protect the lives of 300 million, the experimenters must trespass upon the rights upon 1 million, in a manner that most of them probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice.<p>Of course, those people, having entirely too much trust in the essential goodness of their government, didn&#x27;t consider that the same data could also be used to make bacteriological attacks on foreign populations more effective.  They didn&#x27;t consider whether their &quot;harmless&quot; bacterium was actually harmless.  And they refused to take responsibility for the actual, demonstrable harm to unsuspecting humans.<p><i>This is why we have international conventions against certain military activities,</i> and why we should not tolerate such tests to be conducted upon us, or anyone else.  It makes no difference whether the humans are the subjects or the test medium, because the purpose of the test was to study biological warfare upon humans.  And a biological weapon is one of the few weapons creatable at our current technology level that have the potential to <i>annihilate our entire species</i>.  Any data gathered at all in this domain can only serve to make such weapons more effective, and defenses against them more complex.  None of us can afford a human-versus-human arms race in this, as the one conducted between us and other species is a difficult enough struggle already.",1436545648

9864741,comment,9861966,9862231,0,0,ericsnow,,,"The problem is that in CPython the only mechanism to leverage multiple cores for CPU-bound workloads is the multiprocessing module.  That module suffers from the cost of serializing all objects that are transferred between processes over IPC.  Threading in CPython mostly doesn&#x27;t utilize multiple cores for CPU-bound workloads due to the GIL.<p>The goal of the project is to achieve good multi-core support without the serialization overhead and to make that support both obvious and undeniable.  While very few Python programs actually benefit from true parallelism, it&#x27;s a glaring gap that I&#x27;d like to see filled.<p>My proposal is a means to an end.  I&#x27;d be just as happy if the situation were resolved in some other way and without my involvement.  However, I&#x27;ve found that in open source, waiting for someone else to do what you want done is a losing proposition.  So I&#x27;m not going to hold my breath.  The only project of which I&#x27;m aware that could make a difference is Trent Nelson&#x27;s pyparallel.  I hope to collaborate on that, but I&#x27;ll likely continue pursuing alternatives at the same time for now.  I&#x27;m certainly open to any serious recommendations on how to achieve the goal, if you&#x27;re sincerely interested in making a difference.  (I appreciate the the mention of gevent and Erlang, which are things I&#x27;ve already taken into consideration.)<p>As to the details of my proposal, it&#x27;s very early in the project and the python-ideas post is simply a high-level exploratory discussion of the problem along with a lot of unsettled details about how I think it might be solved in the Python 3.6 timeframe.  A more serious proposal would be in the form of a PEP.<p>Regarding your feedback, the post implies that you either misunderstood what I said or you don&#x27;t understand the underlying technologies.  To clarify:<p>* the proposal is changing/adding relatively little, instead focusing on leverage as much existing features as possible\n* Python&#x27;s existing threading support would be leveraged\n* subinterpreters, which already exist, would be exposed in Python through a new module in the stdlib\n* subinterpreters are already highly independent and share very little global state\n* the key change is enabling subinterpreters to run more or less without the GIL (leaving that to the main interpreter)\n* the key addition is a mechanism to efficiently and safely share objects between subinterpreters\n* the approach is drawing inspiration in part from CSP (Hoare&#x27;s Communicating Sequential Processes)\n* think of it as shared-nothing threads with message passing<p>It will most certainly improve multi-core support.  It shares more in common with Erlang&#x27;s approach than you think.  It is neither a hack nor crap on the wall, as you put it.",1436544286

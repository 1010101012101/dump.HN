5220007,comment,5219506,5219895,6,0,infinite8s,,,"> Second what you are saying also goes to the heart of the issue of job creation. People talk about startups creating jobs. But there is only so much purchasing power in the economy. A startup offering a product or service that is charging is going to take purchasing power away from a consumer or business that is most likely already spending that money somewhere. The only net gains sometimes are only if a country can take jobs from another country or a state or region can take jobs from another state or region or city.<p>That's the flawed zero-sum perception of economics, and history has proved that wrong. If it was true we'd still be living in caves and providing everything for ourselves.",1360857562

Workers in NK do not have control over their output and the gov't is controlled by a core group of insiders.<p>> Once you accept that you're owned by ""society"", and that everyone is ""responsible for the greater good"" this is inevitably what you end up with.<p>Socialism doesn't say that you are owned by society at large and stating there is a responsibility for individuals to their society does not mean that you end up with a totalitarian police state.<p>> You see these same mechanisms happening here in america today-- people claiming that ""health care is a right"" which is essentially saying they have the right to enslave everyone else for their own benefit.<p>This makes no sense, no advocate for health care reform, even universal health care advocates, are saying that people should be enslaved.<p>> Pair the idea that you have a ""right"" to make others pay for healthcare (and other things) with the claim by these same people that you don't have a right to self defense (eg: own guns.) The latter is even in the constituttion.<p>Gun control advocates do not argue that you do not have a right to self defense or even gun ownership, but rather that there can be reasonable regulation on gun ownership.<p>> And when americans are being herded into camps, long disarmed, and forced to work ""from each according to his ability to each according to his needs"".... they will wish they still had guns.<p>I'm assuming the americans you are referring to are white americans, considering the history of herding people of other races into camps and removing their rights to self determination.<p>> Schools teach people to be compliant little sheep and have done so for over a century, there's a distinct connection between government control over schools and lack of critical thinking in the populace.<p>While I agree that public school systems in the US have issues with being politicized and propagandist, some people from the school system do learn critical thinking skills or have those skills enhanced from going to school, so you'll need to offer more argument/evidence to say there is a direct link.<p>> Unless things turn around soon, the US will end up in some sort of terrible state. Not likely like North Korea or Nazi germany or the USSR, but we already are suffering from the economic destruction of these kinds of policies (and like NK citizens told to blame the US for their poverty, we're told to blame wall street, germans were told to blame jews, russians were told to blame ""hoarders"", etc. etc. etc.)<p>The US is suffering economic destruction not from socialist policies, but rather capitalistic policies that seek to dismantle social safety nets and increase wealth disparity. That those policies are now affecting the (mostly) white middle class more compared to people of color (who have been affected by these policies for decades, if not centuries) doesn't mean that we've taken the same path to ruin as NK or the USSR.",1360855079

I have done a lot of work for IBM, they have been a great client, I admit that, that fact may bias me a bit but from my perspective, what IBM has been doing is reducing permanent workforce with contract labor, that can be scaled up and down on a per-project basis. Is it a cost cutting measure? sure. Does it mean that Americans are loosing jobs? no. But it is easy to skew the numbers when you only show that IBM is shedding jobs. But when it is all tallied some of those jobs are being replaced with US based contract labor. This is the reality of the US technical workforce many times after a project you just don't need specific technical talent. The workers don't want to pasture and the employers don't want to carry them until they have work they can utilize them on. My experience is IBM has been moving to an on-demand workforce model. Their is no doubt that some of that is moving offshore but without mentioning the upswing in US based contractors the article does not paint the whole picture. Another fact not mentioned but that I hear from many IBM'ers turned freelancer is their average take home is higher in this model because IBM is willing to pay higher rates to only have to engage when the deals are inked.<p>There is a whole argument to be made about their ability to retain really talented individuals with this model, but it's just not the market they service.",1360854948

It would also be great if there was an option to upload the Rmd sheet, as well as the data files when publishing. Of course, some people publish their entire projects to GitHub, but if it was a lot more convenient, perhaps more people would share - one-button import into your own RStudio, for your own experimentation, would be awesome.",1360854428

Off the top of my head:<p>1) Have the user tap out a simple rhythm with the button to unlock the car. Downsides: kind of involved and the rhythm would have to be long to be secure.<p>2) Put a fingerprint scanner on the key. The one in my laptop is a tiny self-contained module, so I expect it to be possible to fit one inside a wireless car key. Downsides: the scanner can break; can't use in gloves.<p>3) Have the cars mesh network to detect the ""trawling for the right car with a key"" behavior. Downsides: complexity; the thief could exploit this to lock you out of your own car.<p>4) Make the key a wristwatch or a wristband. I think this is the best cheap solution. Downsides: might disagree with your fashion sense.",1360854413

I am <i>much</i> more likely to misread a digital display - in my old car this happened all the time with the digital clock display in the dash. I've never owned a car with a digital-only speedometer, but I've never liked them in rental cars.<p>Digital displays are obviously better for reading a <i>precise</i> value, but not necessarily an <i>accurate</i> one. To generalize, I would say being off by a a couple percent is more likely when reading an analog display, but off by a factor of two is more likely by misreading a digital one.",1360854260

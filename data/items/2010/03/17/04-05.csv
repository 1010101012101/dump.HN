1197829,comment,1196054,1196448,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think there's more to it than that. Somehow Google managed to build a top tier, highly standards compliant browser ""from scratch"" in a short matter of time. Much less time than IE development has <i>not</i> been stagnant, for example. And yet the work and the decisions of the IE team continue to disappoint. They have made some good choices and improved IE a great deal, but they are catching up slower than the other browsers (FF, Chrome, Safari, Opera) are pulling away.<p>More so, there doesn't appear to be any significant sense of urgency in the IE team related to just how far behind they are. Firefox has revolutionized its Javascript engine, massively increased standards compliance, and added support for next generation html5 and css3 features. We'll be lucky if IE9 manages to support css 2.1 correctly, let alone implements html5, css3, or comes out with a competitive javascript engine.<p>Microsoft seems to be pretty complacent in regards to IE because it still dominates marketshare. However, the decline of Myspace shows just how quickly marketshare in the online world can change.",1268801964

Seeing others working hard to improve their own health is motivating for oneself.<p>Second, a gym offers much more than simple pushups can offer. Sure, pushups are great for getting started, but you'll eventually grow strong chest and triceps muscles and the rest of your body will fall behind.<p>The gym you attend is also important. I drive ~15 minutes to the nearest Gold's Gym, because the local Palo Alto gym (4 blocks away) is basically a rich housewife's social club. Gold's is packed with serious lifters, and only $10 (!). It makes a huge difference for me; definitely the difference between going and not going for many, I think.",1268801756

1197817,comment,1196514,1197556,0,0,swernli,,,"> Evolving a product is neither revolutionary nor particularly original.<p>Interesting, because the example you point to, the iPod, didn't really capture it's outrageously huge market share until the iPod Mini, which was an evolution on the original design.  In fact, the entire iPod line until the introduction of touch was a steady evolution from one to the next, and continued onward winning over customers. It beat out other mp3 players despite all of them having the same features, if not more, by doing it well.  Or as you put it:<p>>I am pretty much sure everything on this list was invented by someone else ... it's the execution, not being first ... Also, it's not feature count, it's how well it works on the whole.<p>Thanks for making my point for me :)",1268801636

I moved twice when I was growing up, and I hated it. I'm a homebody. I need a psychological anchor. You may prefer the experience of new people and places, and I prefer having a constant home. It's just who I am. So while I understand where you're coming from, and your reasons for your preference are perfectly valid, in the end it's still just a preference.

(Though if I were hypothetically doing an application to YC or otherwise trying to influence a decisionmaker to give me money, I'd have a website purpose-built for it.)<p>Let's see, previous job application hacks I have actually done: when I was 16 I applied for a summer job at a large American company which sells office supplies, as a seasonal order entry operator.  They sort of value obsessive-compulsive attention to detail in that position (difference between 10 reams of paper and 10 cartons of paper: rather substantial!).  I am not normally a very detail-oriented person but I have a fairly decent memory, so I called them up, asked them to mail me a catalog, and then memorized a few bits of trivia about prominent product lines and all their policies about shipping.<p>During the interview, the person speaking to me mentioned ""drop shipment"", and then proceeded to explain what drop shipment actually is.  I cut her off and said that ""Drop shipment is when you order from $COMPANY but the order actually ships directly from the vendor.""  She asked if I had previous experience in the industry.  I said ""No, but it is written in your catalog.  You see, customers should know whether they are ordering drop shipped products or not, because while drop shipped products are covered by the same 'free shipping for orders above $THRESHHOLD' policy as products shipping from the warehouse, they are not actually carried by the same shipping lines, and appropriately the customer needs to make arrangements to move the item from the door.  However, for an extra charge of $35, the truck driver will take it to anywhere accessible via an elevator.""<p>She looked at me dumbfounded for a moment.<p>""I made it my business to know your business.""<p>That line was pure luck, incidentally -- I had to come up with it on the spot because I did not have a half-dozen prepared, tested, memorable quotes ready to slot in at any opportune time in the interview.

I work out for 30 - 40 minutes, 2 - 3 times a week.<p>I gave up drinking beer _every_ day. And I might have a couple over a weekend.

Always good to get someone involved with the actual system to talk to!<p>As an individual, I'm not concerned about the <i>probability</i> that my flight is delayed -- I want to know if it is delayed <i>for sure</i>.  If I go to flightcaster and it says it isn't delayed, I'm annoyed when I get to the airport and have to wait 2 more hours.  If it says it <i>is</i> delayed and I wait, then I <i>could</i> miss my flight and I will be not only annoyed, but very angry -- probably at myself for trusting you.<p>Of course I could verify the flight status at the airline's website if you say it's a high probability, but in that case, why use FlightCaster at all?  I should always just go to the more likely correct source first.<p>Probabilities might work for airlines or systems that are large enough to be affected by an aggregate flight status or for planning large complicated trips in advance, but if it fails to identify <i>my</i> flights so often, I will simply disregard it as a useful source of information -- as I suspect many individuals will.<p>So, what is your plan? I've read that you may license the technology to bigger firms or something like that, which sounds doable, but in my personal experience, it simply isn't a tool for individual travelers or I don't ""get it.""  I also fly internationally, so all those flights aren't available.<p>What is a use case where this would be useful for an individual?  Am I simply not the right user for FlightCaster? Who is your target market?  From the marketing I read about it, it <i>seems</i> targeted to individuals -- that's usually what tc writes about anyway, so it's a bit confusing for me.  I feel like it could be so useful for me, but I keep getting not so great results.  Even last week I flew from canada through dallas. I couldn't get the first leg, but then the second leg was 2 hours late and on time according to fc.<p>What if you could add something where if I check my flight and I <i>know</i> the status for sure, I can ""correct"" the status at FlightCaster!

It's fine as long as you get a good salary and live in a city with a low cost of living, but you need to ask yourself a few questions first:<p>1. If you lose your job working for Megacorp, who else is willing to hire a senior software/hardware engineer in the state?<p>2. What kind of salary would you even get from the 1 or 2 tech companies in the area?  These companies know they are the only shop in town and probably only pay $50-60K/yr. for senior level positions.<p>3. What type of quality of life are you going to have?  Are there any artistic or cultural activities in the area?<p>If you can answer these questions positively, I say go for it.  Personally, I'd rather live on either coast and make 6 figures than live in flyover country any day.  If I want, I can work on the coast for 20 years and save enough money to live comfortably in flyover country the rest of my life.",1268798724

I don't know if the audience would be big enough to spend the time adding this as an option or if it would be even be feasible, but I thought it worth a mention.<p>Kudos on what appears to be a job well done and best of luck with the sales.

That's not to say vigorous strength training has been clinically shown to increase lifespan, but strong people are <i>much</i> healthier than weak people overall.  Geriatric care givers get dramatic results out of strength training.  I don't think one can make a similar case for jogging or tennis, or whatever.  Strength training has uniquely powerful benefits.<p>""Body Building"" as an aesthetic goal or a ""sport"" is stupid.

For example, any contraption that would be called a ""Rube Goldberg Machine"" would qualify as (non-computer) hacking. MAKE Magazine is full of hacks of this nature as well. The Burning Man Festival is a great place to see things hacked together.<p>Another way might be to fix a perceived flaw through unorthodox means. For example, I put new pickups in my guitar, and they were too hot (too loud, bad distortion). Instead of replacing them (they sounded awesome at lower volumes), I routed the pickup holes to be slightly deeper, then wired in a bypass switch, letting me choose to have a normal tone or naturally overdriven (good distortion) tone. Drummers who put tape over part of a drum skin are hacking their system. Guitarists with old Stratocasters often file their nuts and lower the bridge for better tone.<p>So I respectfully disagree - one can definitely be a (non-computer) hacker and be ethical at the same time.",1268798411

Maybe you pull in Google Analytics, an A/B test, sixteen different web services/Twitter integrations/whatever, and then after a few minutes hit him with a AJAX popup asking for what time is best for you to call him about hiring you.  On the call, you demonstrate uncanny attention to what he needs by the simple expedient of talking about the topics he evidenced the most interest in by interacting with on your resume.  (He read seven blog posts and didn't touch your educational achievements once?  That tells you something.)<p>That isn't dishonest in the slightest: you're using your professional skills to effectively demonstrate that you and the company would be a mutually beneficial pairing.

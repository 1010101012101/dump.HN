I believe a shift has occurred, we are still the 800 pound gorilla but in 50 years, that may be a different picture. That's what I care about, the fact that our lead is waning and we're not doing much about.<p>If we were truly still leading the way, the supercollider we had plans for that was 3 times as powerful as the LHC would've been funded, in the 70-80's. I can't argue that point effectively though because I have read that project was plagued with issues and most likely wouldn't have been an effective use of funds, but we could've focused on fixing those issues or finding a scaled back project instead of letting it die, and leaving it to the EU.",1336078528

It would take a lot of research and work to discover what a ""good district"" is, while in western Europe you can just send your kids to school and not worry about it.  Lots of states don't have any good districts at all.<p>Healthcare paid for by the company is the stupidest thing ever.  The company is trying to save money and having them pay for health care means (a) you have little or no choice of what provider they choose and (b) you cannot be without a job ever due to the insane exposure that would put you and your family under and keeping the insurance plan you had with your employer will usually be prohibitively expensive.<p>Many employers just give you ""catastrophic"" coverage which will leave you with something like a $10k deductible (I'm serious) and if you do manage to go over that expect to take the company to court for not paying.  Anecdotal but I only know two people who tested this (I'm one of them) and in both cases the insurance companies refused to pay.  I sued them to get my bills paid.  The other guy wasn't so lucky.  Shame, he would have retired by 40 if it weren't for a surprise illness.<p>You can't ""always"" take non paid vacation.

I tried contacting the store, but they didn't do anything about it either, so I just created a mail filter and got on with life.<p>I guess the real lesson in my case is: always validate your user's email address by sending it a confirmation link (by t he way, I think people using giant regexps to validate mail are missing the point).

3925756,comment,3924609,3924739,19,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Close. Lots of other companies were also hiring pretty high tier talent as well, and had intense focus. Google's success came down to effectively executing across typically disparate disciplines. You have hard core research level CS eggheads, you have top tier software engineers, and you have state of the art data center operations. In a typical organization these groups have competing interests, they fight amongst themselves and in the end some sort of compromise is reached that allows everyone to grudgingly get along.<p>At google these three groups worked hand in hand and complemented each other's work. The eggheads came up with page rank, the coders figured out how to make pagerank scale through massive paralellism via sharding and mapreduce, and the data center folks figured out how to make sharding cheap and fast through commodity pc based servers and massive amounts of automation for management. In the end everyone was working at the top of their game to help everyone else. The result was that google was able to deliver better results (pagerank) faster (mapreduce) and cheaper (automated commodity hardware datacenters) than the competition.<p>There were lots of other fine details that led to google's success, but in the end those core factors are what allowed them to deliver a better search experience to users (better/faster) and to be more competitive in the marketplace (lower cost per search means more profit even with lower per search ad revenue).<p>No one else in search was pushing on all the right pressure points the way google was, and the rest is history.",1336078339

For example, you could pay me $500 up front for any valuable items you find while cleaning out my grandmother's basement, and you would have purchased something -- ownership of 0 to N valuable items.

I've purchased a pizza -- just one I might never get to eat. (My life is tough this way.)<p>I know this sounds nitpicky, but it's actually important to think about if you're running a Kickstarter campaign with inherently valuable rewards.

I'm also indebted to Grace Hopper [1], who came up with the gem <i>It's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get permission</i>, a behavior that I often find useful. Also, I tend to give the highest level of access to people working under my supervision so they can do their jobs without any avoidable hassle. It's important to be consistent, after all.<p>But (there's always a but) some content creators don't have the same pragmatic thinking I pride myself in having, and will tell you convoluted stories like ""we don't sell the music/video, we sell the physical disc with the thing inside, and you can only access such thing trough the disc"". And sometimes these convoluted stories do stick. Except that when you have a network as the distribution channel they don't work anymore and become plain bizarre ""we sell you only the nontransferable right of watching/listening to this only up to 3 times in the next 24 hours and will not refund you if our network goes down and you're unable to watch"".<p>So, my answer to you, and to the general question is: IMHO, you're ethically in the clear, but legally your situation might raise some concerns.

If Yahoo was so dependent on Inktomi or Google for its Search, I wonder why didn't they work on Search by themselves. After all they were information organization tool. Why did they ignore such a huge market. VC's were going crazy for funding search engines and number of search engines companies were either getting funded or going public. Based on these signals and the traffic they had during dot com era, they could have easily built substantially good search engine; yet they ignored it. Can anyone shed light on it?",1336075678

3925492,comment,3922794,3925299,1,0,NathanRice,,,"Their whole hypothesis is that money can buy happiness, but there is a weak correlation because people have poor consumption patterns, and if people just had better consumption patterns, money would correlate strongly with happiness.  There are a couple of assumptions baked into this hypothesis that I can tear apart on the spot:<p>1.  This assumes that consumptive happiness is additive and unbounded, i.e. if consuming A makes you X points happier, and consuming B makes you Y points happier, consuming A and B makes you (X + Y) happier, ad infinitum.  There is no evidence of this, and this is such a strong assumption that to assume it in the absence of evidence is fallacious.<p>2.  Their data surrounding giving does not control for interpersonal interactions, and personality characteristics.  Since these two variables are both strongly confounding, their results are weak at best.<p>Beyond that, this is a review paper containing no new data.  They are essentially taking isolated data points and playing connect the dots to generate their own pet hypothesis.<p>My ""pet theory"" of happiness is actually the distillate of the idea of happiness as established in a variety of neutral literature (from Aristotle to moderns like Layard and Lyubomirsky), informed to a degree by evolutionary biology.  Do you really trust the impartiality of people publishing in journals for ""Consumer Psychology""?  That reminds me of health studies commissioned by cigarette companies.<p>Down-vote away, it only saddens me to the degree that it makes people less likely to be exposed to a dissenting but informative viewpoint.

It&#x27;s subsiding at about 0.17±0.09mm/year, says <a href=""http://www.fsbpa.com/documents/Florida%20Sea%20Level_rev04042008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fsbpa.com/documents/Florida%20Sea%20Level_rev0404...</a> . &quot;This very preliminary value ... with its very large uncertainty ... should be viewed very cautiously, but a sinking Florida is in general agreement with geophysical models of Earth’s changing shape due to post-glacial rebound from the last ice age.&quot;<p>But the relative rise (same reference, and with a longer baseline) for Miami Beach is 2.4mm/year, so more than 10x faster than can be explained by subsidence.<p>(Also, unlike parts of the US which are sinking due to overpumping from an aquifer, in coastal Florida, seawater will fill in the parts of the freshwater lens which were overpumped. And while the Miami metro area pulls water from the Biscayne aquifer, the relative sea level rise is pretty consistent across Florida, including Cedar Key, which is a relatively isolated location with low population.)<p>The NYT piece references <a href=""http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/blog/2014/10/03/sea-level-rise-in-miami/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/blog/2014/10/03/sea-level-rise-in...</a> which in turn points to <a href=""http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8723214"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8723214</a> as the measurement source. That shows that the numbers are given with respect to NAVD88, and not some relative sea level to a survey point on land.<p>Indeed, that&#x27;s why the data set for this NYT article and my earlier URL to the report describing a sinking Florida only starts in the late 1990s - that&#x27;s when the CORS sites (see <a href=""http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/</a> ) were set up to give absolute positions based on satellite positioning.",1449824087
10716053,comment,10714732,10715856,0,0,crdb,,,"TL;DR: it&#x27;s the McKinsey of this century.<p>From my relatively limited experience in the space: most companies have trouble actually doing anything with their data beyond slicing it a couple of ways [0] and making bad graphs with it; these same companies also have a lot of trouble hiring and retaining [1] people capable of doing it (I know because they end up my clients).<p>Palantir will offer large amounts of money (despite accusations of below market pay; although a good portion is in equity) and a half-decent lifestyle-wise, not too corporate environment to young smart engineers to go and help them outsource that function for the kind of companies that do not care about paying large fees to &quot;get the best&quot;, and for whom the consultant status helps cut through the red tape.<p>The &quot;products&quot; are, from my limited understanding, more like a loose collection of accumulated knowledge from clients which can help future deployments not reinvent the wheel (particularly since so many of the engineers are young and inexperienced). This is also a selling point. &quot;We get it right because we did it before with all these prestigious clients&quot;.<p>Each client has its own infrastructure and schema, and so most data related projects are naturally oriented towards a lot of manual effort - talking to technical staff, reading through code, understanding the data customers and feedback loops... and whilst many companies in the space pretend to offer &quot;plug and play&quot; BI (or data science, or whatever) in practice without a strong data team behind it, these end up failing pretty badly. So I see Palantir&#x27;s competitive edge as its staff, not its products, and I don&#x27;t think much (as a data professional) of pure product data companies.<p>In many ways, Palantir is what McKinsey was half a century ago: it offers job variety and a pick of the best clients to the &quot;top ranked&quot; fresh grads and early professionals; it offers these &quot;guaranteed fresh&quot; minds to clients who have trouble attracting them in-house to solve difficult problems that can&#x27;t in theory be solved by the internal talent pool; it brands itself as the &quot;top&quot; company globally doing this. If it is successful, it will just keep growing its competitive advantage (&quot;you don&#x27;t get fired for hiring IBM&quot;). And I think their focus on people instead of software is a great idea in an age of exceptional open source products and ever cheaper hardware.<p>Where might its cash flow come from? I see two sources:<p>a. as you get further into a data project, you&#x27;ve built the infrastructure and it is comparatively easy to provide answers. For example, once I&#x27;m done with a data warehouse, I can produce a complex report or query answering just about any question management can throw at me in 10 minutes to 2 hours; this will take them two weeks to use. So the time actually spent working, vs the monthly retainer, just keeps going down with time (and of course experience - if you wrote the query for another client you can just change the variable names and output).<p>b. the value add from getting the data right is extremely high. Cf [0] below. For many modern companies it can be the difference between a 50% increase in profits and not being a going concern the following year. As CEOs realize this, and realize that no, you don&#x27;t get &quot;80% of the quality for 20% of the price&quot; by going for the lowest bidders, prices track up and stay there.<p>[0] Most classically trained managers that I&#x27;ve met are unable to cope with more than 2 variables at the same time. A graph is basically a 1D or 2D model with your brain and past experience being the curve fitting. This becomes an issue if the business model fits 20 or 100 dimensions better (e.g. many trading strategies and even market making) and most of your competitors are very comfortable with it.<p>As an example, I&#x27;ve witnessed two e-commerce companies in the same country with a 10x difference in conversion rate; one had statisticians to manage its marketing spend, the other preferred going by the traditional way of &quot;if its conversion rate is high I&#x27;m going to add more budget&quot;.<p>[1] I know an exceptional data scientist who changed jobs 4 times in the last year... each workplace bidding him up!",1449824060

NFC enabled terminals may be the norm at major chain stores but they do not have widespread adoption in smaller retail outlets.<p>The merchant pays for those terminals and they are not inexpensive. Sometimes $1000 or more. That tradeoff (making it slightly easier for you to pay) just isn&#x27;t worth it to most merchants right now. As EMV adoption grows and merchants have to update their terminals to support that as well, NFC will grow.<p>Also, it may seem as if ApplePay is more secure for the banks as it prevents issues with data breaches but to date, it has not prevented any, will continue to only lessen the impact and is absolutely wrought with card fraud as there isn&#x27;t any validation that you own the card you are loading into ApplePay.

The &quot;Republicans are obstructionists&quot; argument is just so silly.<p>Cool, I&#x27;m not taking about that, and I&#x27;m not making that argument, at least not insofar as it excludes Democrats or other political parties. Most politicians are obstructionists, because appearances are worth much more in politics than tangible improvement. I make this statement as a general principle of politics, not constrained to any particular party or even any particular political system. It&#x27;s true in both corporate and governmental politics.<p>>Now the argument has become &quot;well, we don&#x27;t care what he did, we&#x27;ll move heaven and earth to get a soldier home.&quot; Should he be guilty of desertion, I think that&#x27;s an unprecedented and indefensible decision.<p>I think it makes sense to bring our people home, even if they&#x27;re accused of crimes and have to face court martial in the US, as Bergdahl may. It benefits the soldier&#x27;s morale if there is a well-founded belief that the U.S. will fight to get back every captured soldier, no questions asked (at least until the soldier arrives home). Without this practice, it&#x27;d be easy for a unit to abandon someone they dislike in enemy territory, claim he was a deserter, and condemn him to POW status as long as he can live it out.<p>>Veterans find it infuriating that Susan Rice would use the term &quot;honor and distinction&quot; and then qualify it later along with the idea that all soldiers have honor and are distinguished. Here&#x27;s why: it&#x27;s basically saying that you don&#x27;t really care what soldiers actually do, you only care about the appearance of supporting them.<p>I understand the frustration, but please be aware this is a macro-level thing, and as stated above, in politics, it <i>is</i> all about appearances.

We humans are apes, and when you look at other apes, they eat mostly plants, but not always only plants. For example, chimpanzees eat small amounts of meat.<p>I&#x27;m a bit skeptical to the claim that whole grains is a nearly perfect food, though. Think about it - we apes have not eaten huge amounts of grains for most of evolution. Also grains contain various anti-nutrients, otherwise they would have been eaten by insects. It does not seem inconceivable that some of these insect-harming anti-nutrients could also be harmful for humans.<p>Many dietary studies are done with rodents, but I think (I&#x27;m not an expert here) rodents have eaten far more grains than apes during most of evolution.

But if you&#x27;re limiting your field of view only to that which is practically useful, you may be excluding other ways of looking at the world which you may find satisfying.",1449820993

(especially in the international context) I recommend looking into their papers if you&#x27;re interested.<p>That said I found the arguments in this document missing some important points.<p>They don&#x27;t clearly separate the benefits of corporate taxes from a domestic vs international standpoint. These are two very different issues. On the international side they talk about the race to the bottom where counties are attracting companies through lower tax rates. They suggest this is a negative trend but don&#x27;t offer solutions - because it&#x27;s a complex issue with no easy fix. Sovereign countries can chose their tax regime and therefore there is an incentive for some to become tax havens. As an individual country it will hurt you to raise the corporate tax rate since there is a higher incentive for companies to move profits. So are they suggesting all counties agree to raise their corporate tax rates? It&#x27;s not clear. Countries are obviously aware of this issue and are working with the OECD to draft solutions.<p>On the domestic side they gloss over the fact that most countries work to have an integrated tax system. That is, no matter how you structure you taxes when income flows to an individual the total tax paid on that income should be the same. So having a corporation (which usually has a lower tax rate than individuals) gives you a deferral of tax. This is to encourage businesses to reinvest.<p>They claim that if there is no corporate tax then companies will create shell companies and put income there. Tax authorities aren&#x27;t stupid. Even now it would be beneficial to do that since corporate rates are lower than personal rates. Thats why if the company isn&#x27;t earning business income (I.e. you just throw your personal wealth there invested in passive income) the tax rate of the corporation is bumped up to the highest personal rate on that income. So doing what the document suggests would be illegal.<p>The only real argument for changing the corporate tax rate should be (from a domestic standpoint) based on the deferral. That is, do you think companies should pay less tax to help grow their business faster and only pay tax when the owner stops reinvesting in the business?<p>Obviously this is a complex topic and I think that this document glosses over alot of that complexity. Just to note that I&#x27;m most familiar with the Canadian tax system so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve based the domestic discussion on. However, all countries have similar tax policy objectives and should have similar rules in place.",1449820928

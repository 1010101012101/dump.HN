The question was an attempt to see what's entertaining but not valuable, and what's so unique that there's no good substitute for.  For instance, there are other web based email clients (not as good as gmail) but there's no other community I've found as great as HN.

This is a quite insightful and interesting anecdote one user posted:<p>http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=525058&cid=23096424<p><i>When I interned at Google, someone told me a funny anecdote about a guy who emailed their tech support insisting that the Google crawler had deleted his web site. At first, I think he was told that ""Just because we download a copy of your site, doesn't mean your local copy is gone."" (a'la obligatory bash [bash.org].) But, the guy insisted, and finally they double checked and his site was in fact gone. Turns out that it was a home-brewed wiki-style site, and each page had a ""delete"" button. The only problem was, the ""delete"" button sent its query via GET, not POST, and so the Google spider happily followed those links one-by-one and deleted the poor guy's entire site. The Google guys were feeling charitable and so they sent him a backup of his site, but told him he wouldn't be so lucky the next time, and he should change any forms that make changes to POSTs -- GETs are only for queries.<p>So, long story short, I wonder how Google will avoid more of this kind of problem if they're really going off the deep end and submitting random data on random forms on the web. Like the above guy, people may not design their site with such a spider in mind, and despite their lack of foresight this could kill a lot of goodwill if done improperly.</i>",1208398339

If you're not at the airport at least an hour early these days, you may get bumped.  Stress.  Security checks.  Rude airline people.  Delays, cancellation with little or no reimbursement.  A bag of stale peanuts.  An hour down, and fiddle around more in the destination terminal.  Rent a car to get around.  That's at least four hours right there, and probably more.<p>And NO airline is going to be offering $39 flights in California.<p>Meanwhile, I could take a leisurely drive down 101.  Stop for lunch.  Enjoy the ocean.  Relax.  Take a friend or two and save them and you some money.  Pull over once in a while and stretch our legs.  When I arrive, I'm in my own car.

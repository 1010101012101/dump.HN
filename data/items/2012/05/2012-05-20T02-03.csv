3997765,comment,3989136,3995624,1,0,lotharbot,,,"""Being out of code"" isn't always a result of deterioration or neglect; sometimes it's just a matter of the code changing.  Structures built in the 1950s may not have, for example, ADA-compliant accessible restrooms, though the restrooms may be perfectly usable.  But putting in something as simple as a wheelchair ramp at the front door might require also remodeling every single restroom in the building to be ADA-compliant.<p>I've seen half a dozen small religious groups go through this sort of problem -- because they can't afford to make the church/synagogue/etc <i>completely</i> accessible, they aren't able to make incremental improvements.  The buildings remain perfectly functional and well maintained and retain all of their value, except in the eyes of the one guy in a wheelchair who can't get a ramp put in because his church can't afford to drop 15 grand on all the other not-very-useful-but-required stuff.<p>Relating this back to code: if you have a policy that requires any old code must be brought up to new standards any time it's touched, then there are at least some occasions in which someone <i>could</i> have made a useful incremental improvement, but is stopped by a <i>stupid policy decision</i> that would saddle them with burdensome work.  The net result is that small, high-value fixes get put off because of large, low-value busy work.",1337482754
3997764,comment,3995574,3997515,2,0,wvenable,,,"> Strings are copy-on-write, for example. So you are technically passing a reference (from a performance POV), but acting like it's not.<p>That's just an optimization; it's not a very significant detail.  All languages have these little details.  Java, for example, caches and reuses Number instances if the value is below 127.<p>> PHP is a dynamically typed language<p>It's also weakly typed.  You can, for the most part, assume that the type isn't very important.  If you've got the value 12, it doesn't matter much if it's stored as an int, float, or string.  But obviously if you attempt to do an operation not supported by the <i>value</i> then you'll get an error.  There's nothing surprising about that.<p>PHP arrays just take the idea of an index and allow it to be both strings or integers.  In both cases, you're providing a value for the key and getting out another value.  It's pretty easy to explain.  The issue, I'd say, is that programmers rarely ever index by both integers and strings in the same structure.  There are also performance differences but hash tables are so fast that you need to be doing something unusual for it to matter.",1337482728

It looks like the current Labor government will be decimated in the next election (in some ways history is repeating itself from the Hawke-Keating years, which is interesting).<p>Yet the population seems disillusioned with the opposition too. My biggest problem with the opposition is their pointless continued opposition to the NBN.<p>Anyway, the big potential headache for the Australian government here is Assange would go from being a citizen possibly being extradited to the Sweden (and potentially the US) to being a sitting Senator being extradited. While he wouldn't be a head of state and enjoy those protections, I'm not sure if there's any real precedent for extradition of someone in the government like this.<p>Australia should be standing up to the US over this however so it's a headache I would invite and welcome upon our government.<p>That all being said, I'm not sure I buy the theory that Assange's extradition to Sweden is to get his extradited to the US.

I'll try to elaborate the claims in the article a bit (and I'm probably overly simplifying it):<p>when you have a sentence like ""Ill play with this red ball and you can play with that one"", one can ask whether ""one"" refers to ""ball"" or ""red ball"". The sentence doesn't give you information as to which option is true. But, say there are two kids, Chris, playing with a red ball and Max, playing with a blue ball, and someone says ""Chris has a red ball but Max doesnt have one."" In that case, they can learn that 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'. Their argument is that for a language learner (read: baby) to learn correct grammar, he has to encounter such situations, and yet, such situations are rarer than the rate of grammatical errors in similar uses of the word 'one' is higher than the rate of occurrence of scenarios where you could learn the distinction (this is not an assertion, it's backed by analysis of corpora of parents talking to their babies). And yet, their experiments show in a somewhat roundabout manner that the babies treat 'one' as referring the 'red ball' and not 'ball'. Their conclusion is that this means that out of the space of possible grammars, babies didn't consider the ones where 'one' refers to 'ball' and not 'red ball' - there's an innate preference towards those.<p>While I can poke some holes in the argument (mostly because of the implied assumption that the mental representation of grammar is in a generative grammar), your response read too much like <a href=""http://xkcd.com/793/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/793/</a>",1337479365

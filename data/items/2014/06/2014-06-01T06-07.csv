The internet is the most powerful weapon ever conceived in a terrorist&#x27;s arsenal. It allows for instant and private communications with every person on the planet and unlimited knowledge can be shared, there is also the ability to actually gain direct access to some of the governments systems and they could impersonate, spy, leak, or even cause physical damage to the nation.",1401605951

7828399,comment,7826275,7828119,1,0,mpyne,,,"It was changed pretty quickly, to be honest.<p>PRISM was announced as a system that could &quot;literally read your thoughts as you type&quot;. Greenwald said the NSA had direct, unfettered access to Facebook, Google, etc. So naturally I was pretty concerned about this vast abuse of authority and massive blow against Constitutional freedoms, and expressed as much here on HN.<p>But just reading the NSA slides made it clear that something much different (and far less sinister) was being talked about. They couldn&#x27;t &quot;read our thoughts&quot; after all. At worst, the system allowed tech companies to automatically package up the data legally obtained through actual warrants or subpoenas, something previously routinely done manually. PRISM even still required the company&#x27;s manual involvement for each and every single request. The reality was far different from what had been <i>implied</i>, and sometimes even actually stated. Greenwald himself had either lied, or been mislead by someone, and my money was on the latter. But it was Snowden&#x27;s job to know how PRISM worked and get Greenwald to explain it right.<p>When it turned out that the self-described &quot;career intelligence operative&quot; was... not, I quickly realized that things weren&#x27;t as they seemed. And then all sorts of excuses started piling on: Oh, PRISM does require a warrant sometimes, but the Court that issues them gives <i>secret rulings</i> (oooh). Never mind that the Court in question was around since 1978, or that no other nation even bothers putting judicial oversight on foreign intelligence. Snowden said he&#x27;d have been fine with PRISM with Article III warrants, but when an Article III warrant was duly issued for his own arrest then all of a sudden all U.S. courts were corrupt. And on it goes.<p>And it&#x27;s turned out that way for almost literally every single leak since. Some claim would be made about the NSA, but then when pressed Snowden or Greenwald would have to admit that the topic being discussed was a capability, but there wasn&#x27;t evidence of major misuse. Or they&#x27;d leave out important context.<p>A lot of this stuff would have been damning in some way on its own, so I could never figure out why the shiftyness was required. When you&#x27;re debating with the USG and the USG is <i>more</i> honest, that&#x27;s sad in many ways.",1401605813

7828350,comment,7828177,7828177,9,0,notduncansmith,,,"The article was really short and light on details, but the TL;DR of the team&#x27;s reasoning for switching away from Node.js were:<p>1. Multiple application layers could not be brought up in tandem.<p>2. The infrastructure had a single point of failure if the instances went down.<p>3. All functions of the service ran on a single process.<p>4. Latency became an issue due to high CPU and network load during peak usage.<p>5. There was an inability to scale horizontally.<p>The TL;DR for why they shouldn&#x27;t have used Node.js (IMO, not from the article): lack of experience.<p>Node.js (or even Javascript) is not for beginners.  It takes time to write good, solid, maintainable Node apps.  Time that a startup doesn&#x27;t have.  It sounds like they just made a poor technology choice for their team.  According to the article:<p>> Falter said she knew how to write JavaScript and thought she could use that background to learn Node.<p>I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at this part.  There&#x27;s a lot more to being effective with Node.js than knowing Javascript, just like there&#x27;s a lot more to being effective with Rails than knowing Ruby.<p>One thing (or rather, 5 things) that bothered me about this article were the team&#x27;s cited reasons for leaving Node.  I&#x27;d like to address those, in order:<p>1.  I&#x27;m not even entirely sure what they mean by this, but if they&#x27;re talking about operating a service-oriented architecture, then they&#x27;re flat-out wrong.  There&#x27;s nothing inherent to Node that keeps you from deploying multiple instances doing different things.  I&#x27;ve done this several times, in fact, with little hassle.<p>2. and 3. sound reasonable (ish), but are also problems with any Go architecture I&#x27;ve seen.  Hell, most modern server-side tech has this issue, unless you architect around it specifically.  Go doesn&#x27;t appear to have any better answer for this than [Node|Ruby|Python|your_favorite_stack].<p>4. Yes, Node is somewhat memory-hungry.  However, unless you have a single, monolithic server, this is really a non-issue.<p>5. This cannot be attributed to anything but the team&#x27;s effectiveness (or in this case, the lack thereof).  Node scales as horizontally as any other technology.  You can deploy it to Heroku, AWS, etc all day long.  Run as many instances as you want: if they all have the same config, they&#x27;re all the same app.<p>> As the company scaled, the task of administration became increasingly complex, due to “call-back soup”, a common complaint with Node.js.<p>I&#x27;ve said it a million times: &quot;Promises, &#x27;nuff said&quot;.  That being said, promises can be difficult to grok on your own, and because they had 0 experience to draw from, this probably wasn&#x27;t an option for them. No fault on that point, but there are libraries that make managing callbacks fairly easy (not promise easy, but easy).<p>Overall, sounds like the founder made a poor technical choice, and the company suffered.  Still, I really hope they have as much fun and success writing Go as I have over the past few weeks (that is to say, quite a bit).<p>EDIT:  One tidbit I missed the first time reading the article:<p>> Text processing increased 64 percent just by moving from Node to Go.<p>They could have easily gone with a hybrid structure here. Nothing was stopping them from hosting the text processing part in Go (as a service in their possibly-SOA) and then using Node for the rest.  Or, better yet, have a C module that handles the text processing, and call out to that with Node.",1401604304

There&#x27;s a chance your distributions might decrease if for example the yield curve flattens or interest rates decline and the fund has to roll over into lower yielding paper, but for the purposes of discussing FU money you should probably be buffered to withstand a moderate decrease in monthly interest payments anyway.

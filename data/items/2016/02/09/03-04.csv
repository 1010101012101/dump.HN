I want to install both and take a look.\n- I&#x27;d love to check out spark streaming off of a kafka topic.\n- etc.<p>What&#x27;s a cost effective way to have a personal cluster (big enough to really apply distributed techniques in a meaningful way, maybe ~10 nodes)? The most obvious solution is to use digitalocean or aws and only spin up instances when I use it. But I&#x27;d actually rather spend more money upfront ($1000-3000) to just have an always on cluster that I can keep going and not think about spinning up/down. Could I just buy a few servers with alot of ram/cpu and then put VM&#x27;s on them, effectively giving me more instances to use? I could also go the google route, which is buy <i>more</i> commodity hardware at a bargain instead of fewer higher powered servers.<p>I&#x27;m rambling at this point - any input would be appreciated!",1454990297

Everyone (who cares about Twitter or something like it) uses Twitter because everyone else uses Twitter.  You can make an account on Quitter or Diaspora or any other decentralized FLOSS network, but it&#x27;ll be useless because all your non-nerd friends (and most of your nerd friends too) won&#x27;t have accounts there, and will continue to use Twitter and Facebook because that&#x27;s where all their contacts are.  There&#x27;s not really any way around this.  The only thing that can happen is that something will somehow become so popular that everyone will just abandon the current service.  This is what happened with MySpace: for whatever reasons, everyone moved over to Facebook, and abandoned MySpace, and now it&#x27;s a dessicated husk that seems to become a place for bands to advertise and that&#x27;s about it.  This could potentially happen with either Facebook or Twitter, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath; the masses have shown over and over now that they&#x27;re happy to chain themselves to highly centralized, proprietary products and services: FB, Twitter, the &quot;app stores&quot;, not to mention all the proprietary software out there that intentionally and obviously uses nasty lock-in tactics.",1454990218

I think you are severely over-estimating how expensive the fast-path for memory allocations are. For this example, decent memory allocators will execute on the order of a dozen instructions for each malloc and free call - no need to allocate new slabs in the allocator, no need to free old ones, no interactions with the operating system or even the internal slab allocator.<p><i>Calling</i> free is not what is expensive. It&#x27;s what we <i>do</i> when we call free. GC has to do more work because it has to figure things out. Manual memory allocation does not need to spend any instructions figuring anything out because the programmer has already done that. As I have said before, decent memory allocators will keep returning the exact same address for each malloc call in this situation. That is the ideal situation for this case.<p>Also keep in mind that larger heap sizes don&#x27;t come for free - that means more page faults, which will slow you down.",1454990210

They said the idea is that it&#x27;s supposed to feel like the way you navigate photos in albums on iOS; their expectation (whoever designs Yelp&#x27;s iOS UX) is that users want to read many reviews and don&#x27;t skim the review previews first to find the ones they like.<p>I showed them how I prefer to browse reviews: skim the previews, find a promising looking one [Yelp review signal/noise is <i>terrible</i>], &quot;drill into&quot; it, back out, continue until I&#x27;ve read enough reviews to make a judgment.

They don&#x27;t care exactly how fast the processor is, so long as it&#x27;s perceived as &quot;fast enough&quot;.

Given how they&#x27;re pushing to make storage size irrelevant on mobile devices (iCloud, dynamic app deletion/installation, Photos cloud storage, etc), I expect they&#x27;ll eventually drop exact local storage specs in most ads (opting for &quot;small/medium/large&quot;).",1454988997

Other than ISIS, none of the movements you listed could be considered revolutionary in terms of actually changing forms of government.<p>1. Occupy Wall Street was about the financial crisis in &#x27;08. People were angry that the banks got bailed out and everyone else just got (arguably) left out. It went away when the economy finally improved, though there is still enough anger to fuel at least one Presidential campaign.<p>2. Feminism is about equal jobs and rights for women (including in politics). While I&#x27;m sure some of the men had ulterior motives, alot more of them probably just <i>listened</i> to what the women were <i>actually saying</i> and realized that they had a point. Why should half the population be treated worse than the other half? All of your other complaints about a &quot;pro-victim&quot; academic curriculum, or whatever you&#x27;re trying to say here, are just nonsense. Academics have always been weird. The politics behind universities are also weird, but ultimately small stakes and hardly &quot;revolutionary&quot;. People don&#x27;t face down the police and the army because their college doesn&#x27;t have the right sort of Women&#x27;s studies program.<p>3. BLM is about one segment of the population being prosecuted, hurt, and killed by police more than any other group of people. &quot;Stop shooting us&quot; is a powerful message, especially when it&#x27;s backed up by numbers and video, but it&#x27;s not revolutionary. I would also add that the problem has been made worse by the Drug war and the prison-industrial complex so what&#x27;s surprising is that it hasn&#x27;t happened sooner and with more people backing it.<p>4. Trump just wants to be President. His supporters are basically the anti-Occupy Wall Street crowd. They&#x27;re angry about job prospects (especially since 2008), but they blame immigrants and Democrats (+ NAFTA, GATT, etc.) rather than rich bankers. It&#x27;s not something we&#x27;ve seen at this level since the 1900s or earlier, but it&#x27;s not new and they don&#x27;t really seem to want to change anything politically with the way government works.<p>TL;DR: your thesis doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up once you examine why each movement exists and what it&#x27;s trying to do.

Use a git/mercurial branch as the underlying storage mechanism. Being able to clone a repo and get the full issue tracking history would be pretty cool and a storage mechanism with offline and built-in audit tracking is a non-trivial part of the problem, so using something that&#x27;s as proven as the major DVCSs are would help make solving that issue easier.<p>But more importantly, it&#x27;s a hook. It&#x27;s what would differentiate you from other issue trackers. It&#x27;s distributed issue tracking that allows you to take advantage of all the infrastructure that&#x27;s been built up around the underlying DVCSs.

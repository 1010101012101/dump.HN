Was thinking of leaving for awhile, feel kind of bad this is what pushed me off the edge.<p>For me, I stopped and thought about how I access my RSS feeds. I used to be a pure desktop RSS reader, and then I started using both my phone and my desktop, and since Google Reader shut down I&#x27;ve mostly just been using Feedly on my phone. Since I only check my feeds on one device now, I don&#x27;t need to worry about syncing across platforms, which is the primary purpose of Feedly in my opinion.<p>If that sounds like you, and you&#x27;re on Android, check out gReader. While it can integrate with Feedly and a few other services, it can also just act like a &quot;dumb&quot; RSS reader and just download the feed content to your phone instead of relying on a sync service. So far I&#x27;m enjoying the experience.",1402495166
7877998,comment,7877310,7877925,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"From my limited experience, the cloud is always more expensive if you know your exact usage requirements. If, for example, you know that six octo-core 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD-in-RAID1 servers would fit your needs from now until 10 years from now, you will do better to just rent them from SoftLayer, Hetzner, etc.<p>However, if you anticipate growth, or need to be able to spin up a test server, then shut it down a day later, etc. then you are better off paying premium for the cloud. Sure, there are economies of scale at play here: AWS has so many servers, they are not paying a person to log into every one of them every so often to run updates, etc. However, make no mistake: everything you would have to do with a server, Amazon has to do too. In fact, they have to do much more to keep all of them running at once. That cost will be passed onto you.<p>Even with all of that, it&#x27;s cheaper if you want to be able to spin something up, then shut it down. Another great example is the additional services provided by the likes of AWS: you can get things like load balancers, cache servers, database servers, orchestration services, etc. You can do all of this yourself, but at some point it&#x27;s cheaper to just pay for something like ELB than to learn how to do it yourself and spend the hours to set it up. Human time is more expensive than that.<p>Lastly, if you just need a really small machine, there is no beating the cloud. You simply cannot get a dedicated machine for $5/month, and you likely never will.",1402495154

7877940,comment,7876627,7877795,1,0,Silhouette,,,"All valid points, but I would add two more.<p>Firstly, the means to make mass surveillance significantly more difficult and expensive already exist, we just don&#x27;t use them routinely as a society. This lack of security and privacy awareness is harmful for many reasons, only a few of which are related to potential abuses by government organisations, but part of the reason they haven&#x27;t been used more is because of the pressures imposed formally and no doubt less formally by governments. There is always going to be a balance here, because obviously there are bad people in the world and governments are expected (reasonably or otherwise) to protect their citizens and organisations against those bad people. I doubt any government is going to willingly give up all possibilities to intercept communication, but I think you could have a situation with much more transparency and oversight than we have today to keep that power in check and directed to its intended purposes.<p>Secondly, one of the most disappointing things about this whole affair is that our own intelligence and security services (I&#x27;m in the UK) seem to be more concerned with covering their backsides and keeping tight with their US chums than they are with actually, you know, providing for the security of their own country. In an era when foreign surveillance is a significant threat to everyone and so-called allies are among the prime culprits, the duty of our services is to treat those allies as hostile to the extent that their observed behaviour demonstrates they <i>are</i> hostile, and to respond proportionately. US spying on all our citizens&#x27; data? Promote encryption as standard and advise businesses on how to keep their data out of US jurisdiction. If allies have legitimate grounds for wanting sensitive information about British people (and I&#x27;m certainly not saying they won&#x27;t have legitimate grounds for doing so from time to time) then let them request that information through proper channels and in compliance with our laws (and make sure our laws provide for assisting allies appropriately but with appropriate controls and oversight as well).<p>Ultimately, you can&#x27;t rationally expect governments to protect their people without allowing them to use the technical tools and legal powers necessary to do so, but neither can you rationally protect your society and way of life by destroying it. This debate is all about resolving that inherent conflict in as fair and practical a way as possible, and to that extent, I think some fresh views in politics could improve the current situation considerably.",1402494424

Ofcourse the protocols should be implemented separate from the Controller, that&#x27;s the first step but the implemented methods themselves can be made as thin as possible as well.<p>For instance the height could be calculated a static function on the UITableViewCell implementation as I think that&#x27;s the object that should deal with layout.<p>The headers and footers should be separate UIView implementations not something you build there. Methods that are associated with them then can use methods on those classes instead of inline code.<p>I think if  the delegate / datasource classes implement a lot of methods you want to reduce them to 1-3 lines of code between the braces each so you get a complete overview of what each does within 1-2 screens of information.<p>You can also often reduce some plumbing code with:\n<a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSFetchedResultsController_Class/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreDa...</a>",1402493363

Never looked back since.\nMain points in favor of rented dedicated servers:\n- Much cheaper in my business case (5-10 TB/month by server, only a few high CPU requirements) most dedicated come with bandwidth included\n- No need to take care of the hardware in case of failure (opening a ticket versus managing the whole process)\n- Easier to switch machine if needs changes\n- Scales faster (as quickly then 2-3 hours with decent automation tools, and virtualization)\n- No switch, firewall, etc (IPMI should always be behind a firewall, never opened on the Internet)\n- The upfront cost to buy a server was high, and monthly cost of dedicated was actually lower, due to the lack of competition in the colo sector in my area (Montreal, Canada), prices were (and still are) rising quickly, it was hard to predict the long-term costs",1402493349

Look at the situation from Karen&#x27;s side. She started out running the business in the Philippines. Joe came in a year later and took over, effectively demoting her. After discussing the situation, the owners proposed an 80% pay-cut and 4-month leave of absence, something most reasonable people would interpret as a signal that they were being pushed out. Depending on Philippine law, this could have qualified as wrongful termination (most countries are not as employer-friendly with regards to terminations as the U.S.) When Karen sued, the author assumed it must have been some sort of shakedown, because he couldn&#x27;t see how it could be a legitimate grievance. This established the paranoia that ultimately led them to ignoring calls from their own attorney.<p>If the authors had tried to empathize with Karen in the first place: 1) they could&#x27;ve taken actions to avoid the lawsuit; 2) realized that Karen had a pretty compelling case, and treated the suit with the seriousness it warranted. All this probably could have been avoided by some thinking and a severance payment that was less than the time and money wasted on the legal proceeding.",1402492073

I wish this site let initial posts be more than 2000 characters so I could have gone into more detail.<p>The main reason I am hesitant to work with Scala/SBT is because I&#x27;ve been using Docker to package/deploy a lot of the web applications I&#x27;ve written. Since Docker is a one-or-nothing for each line you execute, I am getting either all of the dependencies installed at once (which takes awhile the first time) or - if something fails - I get none of them. The caching that sbt offers is basically thrown out, which is really frustrating.<p>There&#x27;s that, but I also just don&#x27;t like how much weight there seems to be with Scala because of all of the large jars I have to download to do anything. At least, that&#x27;s what it feels like for me.<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure what specific language you would recommend. You indicated that Scala/Clojure aren&#x27;t too bad and offer repls to start playing, but how hard are they to really set up for a decent-sized project? One team that I&#x27;m working with has used Clojure for DSL-related work, but mostly use Java for their main application.<p>Haskell is the language that I&#x27;ve been reading about recently that seems to have more &quot;meat&quot; available each year (from Hackage), which is encouraging. Everyone (including yourself!) claims that it is a beautiful language, and quite a few believe that learning Haskell - and I mean really learning it - has redefined how they approach software development. That kind of change is what I&#x27;m hoping to discover if I delve into a functional language in a big way.<p>I&#x27;d forgotten that I had used DrRacket in academia at one point, but not enough to learn much of it. What exactly makes SICP a classic to you?<p>As for other languages that are beginning to exude some functional... functionality, I&#x27;ve noticed that (with Java 8 and Ruby), but I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;m not really grasping the strengths of said features. I&#x27;m trying to jump into a more functional language to really understand why they can be good and hopefully take away something really meaningful.<p>Thanks for the links! I&#x27;ll check them out later today!",1402491812

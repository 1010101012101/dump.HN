Less than six months later I can now do 80% of what I used to pay people to do for me and 100% understand what they were doing from a high level and why. In another year I think I'll probably be a better developer than most of the people I've hired in the past (mostly because I sucked at hiring good devs because I had no idea how to evaluate their skills).<p>There's nothing I've had to learn that was especially difficult or that requires someone a lot smarter than me or a lot better at math etc. It just requires persistence and a willingness to put up with frustration until you finally solve problems.<p>My only regret is that I didn't start learning 5+ years ago.",1349175285

Windows 8 <i>boots</i> faster from a cold boot than Windows 7. It really does. The memory footprint is much smaller. The runtime environment is much more optimized and snappy.<p>You can tell Microsoft has cut out lots of cruft and optimized critical code-paths, especially with regard to boot.<p>Hibernation which you refer to is a different feature, and provides you with the same session and programs and state as you had running before, just like a normal sleep would do on a laptop, except it will survive a flat battery. It does so by persisting your entire RAM to disk for reloading on boot. This is completely different from booting which would give you a new, empty session.<p>So if you end up with an empty session, it's provenly not hibernating, it's booting. And boot is much, much faster.<p>On all system's I've had, hibarnation, designed to save time, has only caused <i>increased</i> latency for shutdown/sleeping/hibernation, and similar increase in boot times since not only Windows needs to load, but all that persisted state must be restored as well.<p>On machines with more than 4GBs of RAM this leads to horrible performance and I've permanently disabled the option for the OS to use this due to the performance issues involved.<p>On Windows 8 I've kept the defaults and things are just flying.",1349173203

4601305,comment,4601260,4601260,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Why Do Colleges Need A Law For Free Digital Textbooks When We Have The Internet?<p>That's easy to answer -- the Internet is a spectacularly unreliable research resource. By contrast, a textbook, digital or otherwise, costly or free, is the responsibility of its author, not a random, anonymous collection of posters with as many motivations as identities.<p>If the textbook turns out to be wrong, the author can be held to account. If the Internet turns out to be wrong, who do we blame? Answer: the fool who trusted it.",1349172421

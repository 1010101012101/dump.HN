3364831,comment,3364437,3364437,-2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Stallman repeats two idea that are intentionally misleading. He says that proprietary software controls the user instead of the user controlling the software. This is not true and it really depends on what ""features"" you are comfortable with having in programs you buy. Stallman likes to say iTunes is a jail but to him that feature is restrictive while to others it's simply convenient. If I buy a copy of Windows or Office or iWork I <i>do</i> control the software. I'm able to control the input and output. It certainly has limitations but depending upon what knd of user I am I may not care to extend the application or modify it or learn how to do so. If I really wanted those ""free"" abilities then I'll choose free software but Stallman assumes we all want to be free as it relates to software. Not everyone does.<p>The other idea I'd disagree with is how he says free (as in liberty) software can be sold. In theory it certainly can have a price tag but when the source is just out in the open there's no incentive to use the paid version as someone will certainly put out some slightly modified free (gratis) version. That's the bulk of why proprietary software exists in the first place.<p>One more thing that irked me was that Stallman implies that only proprietary software makers will put malicious code in their products. Really? So everyone who's on board the Free Software Movement has only good will towards man and would never dare try to harm another user for their own ends?<p>In the end I think Stallman makes some good points but unfortunately he ends up sounding like an ideologue and at times even a conspiracy theorist. That turns me off. If he's all about freedom then he should also accept that we have the freedom to choose free or proprietary these days and there are people who choose no free software because we don't mind being tied to a certain ecosystem. I love my Mac and I so far, while Lion does treat me like an idiot at times, don't mind the ""restrictions"" at all. In fact I barely notice them because they're just not important to me. That's my choice, the same choice everyone else has. I also have a Linux box which I love for different reasons. In the end I'm able to have it both says and I think everyone does.",1324148292

There should be a 7.5 which is along the lines of:<p>cvs was great and all, but we couldn't version our directories, branching and merging was a mess, the wire protocol was hard to use, it had a ton of security holes and the storage format took up too much space. So, Subversion was created as a way to do a better cvs, without thinking about the larger intrinsic issues with the current state of version control. Thus, missing the whole 'distributed' boat and letting Linus eat our lunch.<p>Note: I worked at CollabNet during this time and watched a lot of the discussions around Subversion.

On the other hand, women are a huge majority among rape victims, and this is not exceptional: 5 to 10% of all women are sexually abused at some point (depends upon the country, again).</i><p>Rape makes up only 6% of violent crimes, and men are much more commonly the victim of violent crimes than women.  In fact, excluding rape, as the severity of violent crimes increase, so does the probability that the victim is male.<p>And couldn't I also say that, while rape is relatively rare, men are over twice as likely to be the victim of severe physical domestic violence (the ratio of murder to rape and rape to severe physical domestic violence is the same).  Or that perpetration rates for physical violence as a whole are significantly higher for women than men.<p>I personally think that these are all bogus arguments because they trivialize rape.  At the same time, trivializing murder is no better than trivializing rape, unless you believe that men are expendable.<p><i>Perhaps the focus of people like you should be to think about your attitude, just like this article conveniently talked about?

3364824,comment,3363620,3364221,3,0,georgemcbay,,,"The first & second parts certainly seem like evolution to me.<p>The slower performance than native JS issue remains to be seen.  I believe Dart, when fully baked, will generate code very similar in performance to ""native"" JS.  In fact, I think it'll probably be better than your average hand-rolled JS code that doesn't use something like Google's Closure Compiler already.  In any case, unless the generated code is substantially slower than ""native"" JavaScript (which there is no basis to believe will be true), this is a bit disingenuous of an argument coming from the web crowd who also advocate writing mobile web apps instead of native apps where you're taking a big speed hit for other benefits.  Software is all about making trade-offs (hopefully the right ones).<p>As far as a more difficult debugging experience -- I think Dart will offer the opposite, a much richer debugging experience for the developer's own code in the form of debugging within the native Dart VM.  The non-Google developer shouldn't have to debug issues that arise due to the JS translation layer, that's on Google to get right, and again if they don't get that right developers just won't use the technology.  I certainly think that whatever Dart's debugging experience ends up being will be much better than the debugging experience for CoffeeScript and other X->JS languages that the JavaScript-only crowd like to reference when talking about how JavaScript is already an adequate ""VM"".<p>As far as Google shoving it down everyone's throat -- what is your basis for that claim?  What have they shoved down everyone's throat so far?  Wave?  With all due respect to Google, they don't have the power to shove anything down developer's throats.  They can simply develop new technology and hope that it offers developers enough real-world benefit that they will adopt it organically.",1324148124

Information can be measured based on the discretization applied to the variables. They basically say if you look at all discretizations, then you can see if there is any way the two variables are related. Of course, they have to resort to an approximate algorithm.

Instead of forwarding your local port to the remote server you can forward a remote port to your local system. Instead of <i>-L8080:localhost:80</i> you can just use<p><pre><code>  ssh -R8080:localhost:80 remote.host\n</code></pre>\nwhich will make your local running web server accessible via the remote port. Of course you can specify instead of localhost other arbitrary hosts which will be exposed via the connection.<p>This is really useful for some firewall punching (if you can access the ssh server or have at least a http proxy which supports CONNECT) and exposing private services remotely.",1324145736

Then I found myself accidentally checking items off by mistake and being annoyed I couldn't recheck them easily.  So I decided since my lists were always short, I would just grey them out so the unchecked ones would stand out.  At least thats my reasoning at the time.<p>Oh, and as a compromise, to remove checked items from the list, you just cycle the list button, and that cleans up the list, so I was hoping you'd get the best of both features.  1. A less twitchy list. 2. The ability to clean up the list.",1324145319

With websites like creativespace.com authors can now publish self-publish with many fewer middle-men - therefore making the price lower and the net gain to the author higher.<p>The same applies for Louis CK's experiment.

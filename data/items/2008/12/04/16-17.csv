385841,comment,385715,385715,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Something I'm wondering - how do you spot that ""transformational"" value in foresight, when the next element (""social disruption"") is all about how these huge shifts in value creation are never really apparent at first glance?<p>For example, I think that YouTube is easily a 10x improvement over things like VHS tapes.  I was just hunting for the opening credits of children's shows that I watched as a kid, and I found every single one (except Voyage of the Mimi ;-)) in about 15 seconds.  My <i>dad</i> has been searching for the songs he grew up with, in the 40s, and they're all there.  It's like a vast nostalgia library.<p>But that didn't exist until enough people started using YouTube that basically everything became available online.  When I first saw YouTube, around the fall of 2005, I was basically like ""What's the point?""  You were limited to 10 minute clips, and it didn't have anything I wanted on it.  Even when Google acquired them for $1.6B, many people say they overpaid.  Heck, people <i>still</i> say they overpaid.<p>And Google Video, which came out before YouTube and offered a very similar feature set, never really caught on.  Nor did the zillion other video-sharing startups.<p>Ideas?  My cofounder once talked with Clayton Christiansen about this (who's done a lot of work on disruptive innovation), and he said that on a micro level, it was basically all luck.  You know what <i>doesn't</i> work, but finding out what <i>does</i> is basically just a matter of trying lots and lots of ideas and letting the vast majority fail.",1228409768

385819,comment,384606,385363,0,0,pg,,,"Ok, so you agree that since 1960 it's been true that large organizations no longer get all the best people.  The question is whether before that ambitious people were drawn to larger organizations or not.<p>You have (accidentally I realize) selected a very anomalous time and place as your counterexample.  In the first half of its history America was practically unique among richer countries in having huge amounts of unsettled agricultural land.  So yes, in America between 1650 and 1850, a lot of ambitious people moved west to establish new farms.  But broaden the scope to include the rest of the world, and the time to more than that 200 year window, and ask the question: did an ambitious person stay in his local village and farm, or did he leave to seek his fortune?<p>You can also approach this question from the other direction.  Examine a large organization for its time (e.g. the British East India Company, the Medici bank, Cluny, the papal curia) and ask: were the people running it more or less ambitious than peers who'd stayed on the farm?<p>Either way you get the same answer.",1228408926

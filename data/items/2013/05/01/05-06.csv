5636660,comment,5620842,5634119,1,0,glenra,,,"Read the links I gave. I wasn't expecting you to be convinced just by what I wrote above.<p>Before 1962, the FDA was tasked to verify <i>safety</i> but NOT to verify efficacy. Everything you just wrote only argues for that - for keeping drugs off the market that ""kill someone"" when they take it. It does NOT argue for keeping drugs off the market that we know are safe but can't yet conclusively prove work ""better than a placebo"" or ""better than the standard treatment"" in a study.<p>After 1962, the FDA was tasked with determining <i>efficacy</i>. That is the part where the main problem lies. It turns out that proving that a drug probably doesn't kill people is MUCH easier than proving that a drug ""works"" at a level better than some metric.<p>To prove a drug is safe, we have models and processes to calculate the LD50 and verify that people who take it at expected dose levels don't get sick. But to prove it's <i>effective</i> is hard. Hard enough that, in practice, insisting on it it kills hundreds of thousands of people. As one popular example, when the FDA approved beta blockers for use in preventing heart attacks, the FDA's own press release claimed that the newly approved drugs would save 10,000 lives per year, based on the results seen in Europe where the drugs had been in use for the prior decade. Economists look at that and notice that seems to suggest keeping that one class of drug OFF the market in the US after it had been approved in Europe killed on the order of 100,000 people all told. That is a very large death count. The worst death count we've ever seen due to drugs that ""slipped through the cracks"" prior to 1962 is a few orders of magnitude smaller than that.<p>> <i>The situation where a drug kills someone will be weighed much more gravely than the situation where a life-saving drug was kept from you because it couldn't be proven effective. So a net-lives-saved calculation simply doesn't capture the intuition that most people have.</i><p>That is true, but in this case the ""intuition that most people have"" is WRONG. By any rational standard, killing a hundred people by preventing them from getting their medicine is MUCH WORSE than killing one person by letting him get his medicine...even if we <i>know who the people affected are</i> in the latter case and not the former. That is approximately the sort of tradeoff we're looking at.<p>> <i>It is impossible to predict how many deaths were prevented from keeping dangerous drugs off the market, so it is impossible to make a meaningful comparison.</i><p>It is difficult, but probably not impossible. One might look at the death rates attributed to medicinal prescription drugs under various regulatory regimes. In the US, you can compare drugs approved pre-1962 versus post-1962 - if the FDA's extra testing in the modern era were really valuable, there should be a bend in that curve in the correct direction (hint: there isn't). One can also compare with other countries that changed <i>their</i> regulatory regimes to be stricter or looser. Sure, you can't get an <i>exact number</i> of deaths, but you can make a plausible estimate. And this calculation WAY favors the FDA approach, due to the ""what is seen and what is not seen"" factor - people who die from taking a drug show up in newspaper headlines blaming the drug whereas people who die from NOT taking a drug do not show up in newspaper headlines blaming the FDA. :-)<p>BTW, one simple huge improvement would be to just say that any drug approved for use by some other country's regulatory apparatus could be used here too with a mere ""not yet approved by the FDA"" warning label.",1367387320

5636657,comment,5636490,5636490,1,0,comex,,,"The native versus web app debate conflates a number of different issues, which divide the two camps more due to history than any fundamental technical gulf.<p>Native apps traditionally run faster than web apps.  Some operating systems use higher level runtimes than others and a few are based on HTML anyway, and on desktop the performance difference is arguably unimportant, but on mobile it doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.<p>Native apps have to be downloaded and installed, and <i>trusted</i>, while web apps can be run instantly and are sandboxed.  Why?  There is no fundamental reason why I shouldn't be able to go to a URL and get an instant, properly sandboxed native UI, which then goes away when I'm done using it unless I explicitly choose to save it.<p>Native apps on most platforms are moving to an app store model which, as mentioned in the article, integrate things like payment and have gatekeepers that can benefit users.  But there is no reason web apps can't have these features, and Mozilla is working on a curated marketplace and a payment API for web apps.<p>Web apps can be deep-linked into, which many web advocates claim is critical, and generally follow more of a page metaphor than native apps: I can open any two locations in the Gmail UI in tabs rather than being limited to what, if anything, the app author specifically designed to allow multiple parallel views, I can bookmark a location in the UI (yes, there is a rut of poor design in between traditional server-side apps, which are naturally bookmarkable, and well-designed client-side apps like Gmail, which manually implement this feature, but the culture encourages making it possible).  But why shouldn't native apps intercept a specific URLs and provide an alternate implementation for deep links, and why don't native UI toolkits naturally support a page metaphor?<p>Web apps are traditionally more hackable than native apps.  There is a culture of browser extensions that hook into page scripts and modify them without any formal API, but similar functionality, while usually possible, is rarely popular for native apps, except perhaps on jailbroken iOS.  This is to some degree an inherent result of web apps being limited to high level languages, but improvements in tooling and changes to culture could definitely make up for this, and could significantly improve native apps for power users.<p>And finally, at their best, native apps follow a specific platform's UI conventions, while web apps are sort of a global compromise.  Out of all these differences, this is the one that actually makes sense: at best, native apps will give you a choice between several good but opinionated UI paradigms, so that different users will have different preferences but will often prefer one of the options over the generic version.<p>But every other one of those differences represents a compromise I, as a user, currently have to make when I choose between a web app and a native app.  Whether whatever technology or technologies win out in the end are based on JavaScript, C, or something else, I think that ""web vs native"" is just a symptom of a platform war that still has a long way to go.",1367387288
5636656,comment,5635303,5635303,8,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The flaw in all of this is that you're embedding 20 bytes in the blockchain. In order to do that, you have to choose an encoding method. In order to get the embedded data back out, you have to convey the encoding method and which block is encoded with it to the recipient. Which is totally pointless because if you can convey <i>that</i> to the recipient then you might as well just use the same communications method to convey the original message. The only plausible reason not to would be if the law prohibits the message but not the information about how to construct the message from the blockchain (and even that is not guaranteed). Even then all you would accomplish is to cause the government to pass a new law that prohibits you from telling anyone that a prohibited link is encoded in the block in the same way that you're currently prohibited from telling anyone the link itself.<p>The real problem here is not that child pornographers would actually use bitcoin to distribute links, it's that assholes who want to damage bitcoin would put contraband in the blockchain in order to cause legal trouble for innocent users.<p>But I think that's a broader problem than just bitcoin. You can encode anything into anything. Take anything anyone else has posted and xor it with something you want to encode. The output will resemble garbage rather than either input. But now you can post the ""garbage"" and instructions on what to xor it with to allow anyone to recover your encoded message, and the poster of the other message becomes an unwilling participant in your encoding scheme. It clearly makes no sense to punish distributors of the original message just because the encoded message is contraband. Which doesn't mean there won't be laws that will punish it anyway, but <i>that</i> is the fight that needs to be won -- to not allow stupid laws that would punish innocent people.",1367387158

The bigger issue is that VC-funded companies need to keep a tight leash on their product, whereas grant-funded projects are free to grow in a distributed fashion.

A few missing links in that chain can sink the ship, while catching the right eye in the right way can ensure global adoption.<p>So having a negative attitude toward them all is safe in the sense that you'll almost always be right, and you'll be constantly reinforced in your beliefs.

That's a difficult position to hold - it's much better to think about where your product will need to be in a few years, and make sure that it can grow (add-ons, upgrades, etc.) without needing to be replaced.  Not much different than software in that sense.<p>I'm not sure how one starts a hardware company these days without being a software developer (there's usually more firmware work than electronics...) - but I see it happen all of the time, people don't really care how good the firmware/software is, as long as it works, it would seem.",1367385006

5636556,comment,5636338,5636338,4,0,robomartin,,,"Good article.  A few points:<p>> There is no AWS-equivalent for hardware.<p>Well, yes and no.  Of course, it doesn't make sense to talk about AWS for manufacturing.  Making physical items means that your supply chain, manufacturing process and channel of distribution have different time constants when compared to pure software-and-servers businesses.<p>By this I mean that step changes in supply, production or demand happen at far slower rated than in pure software products.<p>If by ""AWS"" we mean a manufacturing system that allows the entrepreneur to turn on and off chunks of manufacturing capacity with some immediacy and granularity, no that does not exist.  And, that is so because it is just-about impossible for most consumer products.<p>The supply chain for most consumer goods is such that it has to start being stuffed with components and assemblies weeks in advance of manufacturing.  Some OEM components have lead times measured in months.  Others have MOQ's (Minimum Order Quantities) that can force commitment levels both to product volume and manufacturing effort/timelines.<p>As an example, I am currently working on a project --to be featured on Kickstarter-- that requires a custom aluminum extrusion in order to be able to manufacture it economically.  Aside from tooling and setup NRE's most extruders have minimum buys that can range up to 2,000lbs of aluminum.  In other words, once you play that game you are all in and committed to manufacturing at a certain level.  Once these processes start you simply can't logon and stop them from your browser (or spin-up new ones) as you might do with AWS.<p>> Proper planning is essential because mistakes can be unrecoverable. For example, you might create a design that fails environmental tests but only discover this years later when you are about to go to market.<p>Right.  And this is why elsewhere in the article he mentions that a lot of hardware entrepreneurs are older and more experienced engineers.  When it comes to physical product manufacturing, experience can be invaluable.  There's a lot that simply isn't learned in school.  You can't recompile your way out of a design error.<p>> The build-test-iterate model that is popular in software startups doesnt translate well to hardware startups.<p>Well, it does in certain domains.  For example, every FPGA-based design I've done goes through extensive simulator testing before actually being committed to real hardware.  The same is true of such things as high speed signal and power integrity (using field solvers and other tools).<p>When it comes to mechanical and thermal design a lot can be done with modern CAD systems through simulation.  As an example, we devoted no less than six months to the design and simulation of an advanced liquid/forced air thermal management system for a 1,000W (yes, one thousand watt) LED array.  The simulations were good enough that we could go to metal knowing we were going to be reasonably close.<p>The same is true with mechanical and plastics simulation.<p>Now, if what we mean by built-test-iterate means the inclusion of the actual end-user in a real market situation I have to say, yes, it is much harder.  This is where prototypes are designed to be easy to change and adjust in order to experiment with form, fit and function.<p>In the end hardware startups are very different animals. I am not sure they can be compared through the same metrics.",1367384812

Or if people splat other ways (e.g. in car crashes, tightrope accidents). The result is the same. Splatty splat splat. The outcome only tells you so much.<p>I can tell you one thing: Totally overhauling my ""motivation, goals, and emotions"" did absolutely diddlysquat in making me better because while I started off with a combination of routine infection and ""psychological"" stress (which, of course, is a kind of misnomer because you can measure it with blood tests)... it did permanent damage to my mechanicals. Splat.<p>Also, a lot of doctors think FM/ME/CFS are the same thing. And a lot think adrenal fatigue/hypothyroid and CFS are the same thing. Maybe they are separate but cause each other.<p>Genetics certainly play a part; hypothyroid is incredibly heritable, for example. It causes lots of the same symptoms and may be a symptom/cause (or both) itself.<p>But nobody claims that hypothyroidism is psychological, not even slightly, much less primarily.<p>But the cause for an individual almost doesn't matter.

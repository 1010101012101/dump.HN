It _shouldn't_, but it does.<p>I know we've talked about this before, Aaron, but I think you have to work like hell for the next 6 months to get people using _some part of your system.  You've had uptake in libraries... try to get your system in as many libraries as possible.  Get some press for that uptake and traction. You  do this really well.  Then, pitch 100 VC's in 3 months:  3 a day for 93 days, and raise money on that basis.  If you can't raise money then, build traction like hell for another 6 months, mail monthly updates to those 100 VCs and then talk to the most interested 30 VCs again.<p>Your pitch: take on credit cards and beat them is _huge.  I genuinely believe that you can do it.  But, to do it all at once would probably take $100M up front as a series A round, and then a couple of follow rounds of $500M in series B and C.<p>Most VC's aren't going to believe that you'll be able to do it, and certainly won't give you $100M in a series A.<p>I suspect you need to show them that you can perform really well on one, small aspect of your system, and they'll probably be willing to give you money to expand.<p>I have no doubt you'll be able to do this.  You've been doggedly working at this for 5 years.  You have a very cool working product.  At some point, I have no doubt you'll raise the money that you need.  And, you can have your revenge in 10 years when you IPO.  :)<p>The stories of people having money thrown at them by VC's for a business plan make for great TechCrunch reading, and it hits the main stream press, ""The Bubble is popping!  The Bubble is inflating!   The Bubble is about to pop!"".  But, I talk with around a hundreds early entrepreneurs every month at Hackers & Founders, and _no _one is having money thrown at them.  For every Color, or AirBnB, there are 3000 founders that pitch 60 times before they're able to raise.",1311494273

2798922,comment,2797016,2797311,1,0,SamReidHughes,,,"Refactoring a stateless program into one that uses state is a big pain.  Making programs that use different amounts of state, or kinds of state, at different parts within the program, is also a big pain.  Functional programming languages including ones where monads are regularly used are just bad at this.  You get towers of state transformers, or a lot of boilerplate for converting between one kind of state to another, and boilerplate for entering and leaving different kinds of stateful situations.  Or you can just have one big state monad that goes everywhere, in which case there's three kinds of things, which are functions that live purely in IO, those which are pure, and those which live in your state monad.<p>But then you realize that certain purely IO actions need to do some logging and then they can't live in the IO monad and you need to refactor logging out of everything else and put your logging monad inside your state monad (and put a bunch of new liftIO's all over the place), but wait, didn't you just want to add some logging statements to debug this thing, and now you're tearing apart the structure of the world.<p>So maybe we could come up with some abstraction for logically separate components of a program's state, and then create a type of action that uses descriptors telling what subset of a program's state components are used, or we could not do that and recognize that functional programming <i>does not work just fine</i>, and that pure functional languages are bad at working with state.",1311493872

This article in particular is more pathetic than most. When I read phrases like ""Because wading through piles of legalese isnt something that I (or you) can spend most of my time doing, for better or for worse, I dont understand the ins and outs of the case,"" it's simply insulting. Alexia Tsotsis, and just as often her colleagues at TechCrunch, should be embarrassed to admit such things. Any real newspaper would fire her on the spot.<p>- Facebook did withhold evidence both in the Winklevosses' litigation and my own. It's easy to tell because even after years of said litigation, Business Insider and other sources kept coming out with new IM conversation after new IM conversation. I've still never seen the documents I requested from Facebook in 2008 and 2009 because Facebook claimed they didn't exist. They do.<p>- I've never met the Winklevosses or Divya. I wasn't there when Mark agreed to work for them, and Mark didn't tell me about them when I met Mark. In other words, what happened from my perspective was independent of anything they've said or done, and I don't know enough to comment on their personalities. I do, however, know enough to comment on their ethics. They lied on national television when they claimed that they had no prior knowledge of The Social Network on Today (one of the morning shows). Random House's general counsel confirmed that Ben Mezrich interviewed them for The Accidental Billionaires.<p>- I did meet Larry Summers during his monthly office hours while he was president of Harvard. His behavior then was reprehensible, and he hasn't changed a bit.<p>- Just about everyone primarily involved in this whole story is fairly unpleasant. Relentlessly trying to set the record straight hasn't made me appear much better, but I've done my best to stay away from it all (hence turning down Mezrich's offer to be a ""compelling character."") What's truly sad about it is that for seven years now, not a single reporter has done an in-depth investigation in an attempt to get the story right. We all enjoyed the movie, but that's not what happened. And when you start drawing conclusions under headlines like ""The Winklevosses vs. Silicon Valley,"" you're bound to be wrong if you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.",1311492399

While Google+ might be the next centralized ship that everyone jumps to (after Facebook, Myspace, Friendster), I have no doubt that the future of social networking is decentralized.  While there is very interesting work being done (and hopefully my project* would be included in that assessment), it may be the case that an organization with the clout and resources of Mozilla may be the most likely hope for moving away from walled gardens.<p>* <a href=""http://opensource.appleseedproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.appleseedproject.org/</a>",1311491786

I ended up going to a store in Denver that strips old electronics and sells the components.<p>There are tons of electronics geeks still around from Arduino builders to car audiophiles building custom circuits to the RC crowd - and no one serves them. Right now half RS's inventory is available at Best Buy, Walmart and every other store with an electronics department.

Of course revenue is still coming in but with an estimated $1.2T budget deficit for 2011 that's not going to be nearly enough. So you're right -- the hitting of the debt ceiling back in May wasn't a huge deal because there was money left to pay the bills. What happens in early August is the government simply runs out of money. Revenue will continue coming in and would be enough to continue paying the interest on the debt for a while however the government would have to start making some <i>very</i> politically unpopular choices about which bills to pay.<p>Even if we can continue paying the interest payments you have something of a symbolic default if the US government is unable to get its fiscal affairs in order. While the US may not technically default there will be a crisis of confidence. The risks of the symbolic default are just as bad as a real default and the ramifications are almost impossible to calculate.",1311490938

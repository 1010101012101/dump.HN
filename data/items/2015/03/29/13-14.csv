I asked one of the developers once and he said the bulk of it was in Fortran 90/95.  But there is still a lot of Fortran 77 code around, particularly in well-debugged libraries.  This developer wanted to use a more modern dialect and take advantage of some of the new features, like object orientation, but it was hard to get the scientists to learn the new features.  That&#x27;s a big part of why Fortran endures, it&#x27;s simple inertia.<p>During development of the original ANSI standard for C, the Cray rep and others wanted to add features that would enable C to kill Fortran. This meant adding complex numbers (which happened in C99 and was made optional in C11), and doing something about unrestricted pointers.

If that analysis succeeds, then I suppose the object could be stack-allocated and the finalizer called directly.  Even then, though, you would have to think carefully about all the subtle ramifications, like the consequences running a finalizer on an application thread instead of the finalizer thread.  (What if the finalizer grabs a lock in an attempt to protect itself from the application code?  Now this becomes a recursive lock by one thread, and so both the application code and the finalizer can enter it at the same time!)<p>If this ever became important enough, it&#x27;s possible the JIT developers could get this right in every case with enough effort invested.

Case in point, I know a number of blind Python developers. I myself did a lot of Python during college, back when Zope was huge and Plone didn&#x27;t exist. It&#x27;s no more or less difficult than any other high-level language. Just about every screen reader I&#x27;ve used has the ability to speak line indentation (I.e. &quot;8 spaces def fn(...&quot;) and this makes tracking scope easy. Holding a function in your head based on hearing it spoken is a skill that improves with practice. I&#x27;ve coded to varying degrees in every language you&#x27;ve listed, and while some of them do have their unique accessibility challenges (Haskell in particular I find dense because &quot;f . g $ h i&quot; packs a lot of meaning into something with little to break it up) I&#x27;ve learned to audit orally parse them over time.<p>FWIW, as a blind person, I imagine that coordinating the motion of a 2-ton block of metal and glass, down a strip of asphalt surrounded by a number of other chunks of metal and glass, moving as fast as baseballs and prone to factors like weather and surface conditions,, is a very fragile process that terrifies the hell out of me if I really think about it for any amount of time.

The wealthier parts of town tend to be in these inner cores, and the low-end workers tend to live in the outskirts.<p>The outskirts areas of European cities are generally pretty abysmal by American standards. Unkempt, graffiti-filled, feel dangerous. This is where all the train yards are. They remind an American of what we call &quot;inner-city&quot; projects, only they surround their home city.<p>Because of the income levels that live there, and being tightly wrapped around the more prosperous inner cores, they are however, better informed by the pedestrian friendly natures of those inner cores. So they usually have great integrated bus service and passable mass-transit (if the city has it).<p>The reasons for this outer ring are numerous, but it&#x27;s usually a mix of rapid construction after the war (people needed houses, FAST), mid-century social experiments (public housing projects), and the inertia created by those two things.<p>What&#x27;s outside this ring? Generally farmland, dotted with small towns and villages. I&#x27;ve never seen density drop off in the states as quickly as I do in Europe. You&#x27;re in a city and then you&#x27;re immediately in the countryside -- there&#x27;s very little transition. It&#x27;s not true <i>everywhere</i> in Europe. But it&#x27;s fairly consistent.<p>Cities in Europe are also pretty close, Glasgow to Edinburgh is ~1hr driving. Glasgow to Manchester is ~3.5hrs, to London in 6.5, and Paris in 11. If they weren&#x27;t so close, inter-city transport would be unbearable. But because they&#x27;re so close, national rail ends up working like commuter rail and you can hop a train from Glasgow to London in 4 hours.<p>Heck, Glasgow to Kiev is 31 hours, or about 4 days of driving.<p>Or here&#x27;s a trip I did once in Ireland. Dublin to Belfast to Dublin to Galway. It crosses the entire country a couple time and the whole thing takes around 6 hours.<p>Here&#x27;s a comparison of Scotland vs. a state in the U.S., Virginia. <a href=""https://mapfight.appspot.com/scotland-vs-us.va/scotland-virginia-us-size-comparison"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mapfight.appspot.com/scotland-vs-us.va/scotland-virg...</a><p>Virginia has 3 major urban areas, the North (near Washington D.C.), the Capital at Richmond, and the South Eastern Coast around Norfolk.<p>The North of Virginia is a bit like London, a continuous conglomeration of several adjacent areas and small towns and cities. It has about 3 million people in it, but it&#x27;s worth looking at a piece at a time:<p>Arlington, VA has about the density of Glasgow, has several interesting neighborhoods, is highly walkable, has subway service, buses, is bikable.<p>A walk from Celtic Park to Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow will take you about 1.5hrs. While a similar length walk in Arlington from the Potomac Overlook Park to the National Cemetery takes you about 1.5 hrs. Here&#x27;s what the core looks like from the air (the circles are areas around the subway stations) <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/ArlingtonTODimage3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/Arlingto...</a><p>It only has about 1/3 of the population of Glasgow, but most purposes it&#x27;s a fair approximation of a place like Glasgow in the U.S. If you figure in Neighboring Alexandria, VA (also part of the North), you get even closer to an American Glasgow. It&#x27;s every bit as reasonable a place as most European cities.<p>But Arlington and Alexandria aren&#x27;t particularly important areas in the U.S. They&#x27;re just parts of the Washington D.C. metro area, which has around 6 million people, the 7th largest in the U.S.<p>Now drive 2 hours South to Richmond, which by American standards is old, founded in 1737 (before the U.S. existed!) And even though it&#x27;s half the density of Arlington and Glasgow, is still highly walkable in most of the city. It doesn&#x27;t have a subway, but it has extensive bus service, a major university, government buildings, etc. It feels like a small European city in those ways.<p>Go 2 hours East and you end up in Norfolk, which is basically a conglomeration of military bases and ship builders. With about as much thought put into city planning as that sounds. It&#x27;s not very walkable, suffers from all of the criticisms ever levied against American cities, requires a car to get around etc.<p>Now what&#x27;s in the rest of the state? Farmland, small towns, villages. But Virginia doesn&#x27;t have to rely on Virginia for farming. There&#x27;s a million square miles in the middle of the U.S. that do nothing but grow food, and most of that land sits unused, and unfarmed.<p>So most of Virginia&#x27;s farmland is nonproductive. It sits there unused and non-productive. So what do you do with a bunch of cheap land that&#x27;s only costing farmers money? You sell it, chop it up and offer houses to people who want to raise families outside of a city, but don&#x27;t want to live in the isolation of the wilds. You create suburbs.<p>So 2 out of 3 ain&#x27;t bad. I&#x27;ve just described 2 minor American urban areas that are as reasonable as most places in Europe. You can even take a train between them.<p>Suburbs are not a uniquely American thing.

Overreact much?  :-)<p>Garbage collection works great for one use case: managing heap memory.  Please, let&#x27;s not return to a universe where you need to free each chunk of memory piecewise.  That makes freeing memory O(n) in the number of chunks freed, where modern collectors can free unlimited numbers of objects in O(1) time.  Compared to this, malloc and free are a little like keeping score in soccer by tracking every action that does not result in a ball entering a net.<p>The trouble is finalizers.  Finalizers suck.  They tie the management of one resource (say native memory or file handles) to an unrelated resource (heap memory).  This has the terrible consequences highlighted by this story, plus others.  It keeps the native resource tied up until the collector decides to run, for one thing.  It also harms performance in secondary ways even when the finalizer isn&#x27;t running.  For example, finalizers typically defeat escape analysis, meaning objects with finalizers can&#x27;t be stack-allocated.<p>It&#x27;s a good idea to use finalizers mostly for detecting invalid final states of objects (like leaking resources), as long as you stay aware that finalizers can slow down your program in unexpected ways.<p>[These are my personal opinions, not those of my employer.]",1427635539

Perhaps there is a longer route, over less obvious residential streets, that will be more comfortable?

There are a number of riding clubs and meetups, with varying degrees of formality and expectations; you might find riding in LA traffic less intimidating with a group. You will find that driving lanes are biking lanes. Swerving from shoulder to shoulder is a mistake you don&#x27;t have to make.<p>And I echo sibling&#x27;s suggestion to get a more practical bike. When you get &quot;off the map&quot; [away from routes that cars are forced to travel] you might find all sorts of sketchy but bike-friendly shortcuts, through parks, parking lots, industrial areas, etc. Skinny road bike tires don&#x27;t like these routes, but LA streets are full of all the same hazards.",1427635218

It comes down to the following:<p>1) Embedded engineers are generally EE that have taken a course or two in software. Generally they are the &quot;best software guys&quot; from a group of middling to poor software guys. As such, they reach for tools they are familiar with.<p>2) The product from embedded engineering is much different from web development. It might ship on a ROM, for a part with < 64kRAM. In circumstances such as this, knowing your toolchain won&#x27;t add any complexities you don&#x27;t understand is very important, and it doesn&#x27;t get much simpler than C. (Also, most good embedded engineers use a restricted set of C that doesn&#x27;t include things like printf and malloc.)",1427635170

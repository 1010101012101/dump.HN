The author tries to dispel some of the superlatives in the public statements about the work, and provides good detail about what they&#x27;ve done: a novel way to produce a single material (&quot;nanosheet&quot;) that when pumped, emits at multiple (three gets you white light, and what they did here) wavelengths.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3f0oyo/the_first_white_laser_scientists_and_engineers_at/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3f0oyo/the_first_w...</a><p>> Actually, there are a few key points we wanted to make with this paper. First, yes this is semiconductor-based, which offers a few advantages over optical fiber technology. The second is that this was accomplished in a single growth run, unlike several other devices we cite which essentially just run multiple lasers in parallel. Third, the growth mechanism for these nanosheets is novel. Also, as far as we could tell, we provided the first direct evidence for the nanobelt-nanosheet conversion mechanism. It had been previously proposed before in a single paper, but did not have any experimental evidence to back up the claim.<p>> Also, the linked article is somewhat sloppy. We are by no means reporting the first ever white laser, and in fact we cite several examples of previous setups used to produce white lasing. In this paper we report the first monolithic, semiconductor-based laser.",1438235936

9973341,comment,9973156,9973301,0,0,tikhonj,,,"&quot;Kicking and screaming&quot;, to be fair, is a bit of a literary exaggeration. But Rossum did not particularly <i>want</i> to add functional features to the language and only did so at the behest of his users. Lambda as well as map/filter/reduce were &quot;a significant, early chunk of contributed code&quot;, not something he intended the language to have from the outset[1]. More recently, he has been trying to deemphasize these features in favor of list comprehensions.<p>Moreover, Rossum is opposed to proper tail calls and even recursion in general[2]. He also doesn&#x27;t like folds, and generally thinks you should just express that sort of logic as some sort of loop. (I forget exactly where I read that opinion, but it could easily have been [1].)<p>He&#x27;s a staunchly imperative programmer, and the design of Python shows this off consistently except for an initial accident of first-class functions and closures (of a sort)—a design he likes because it enabled other, non-functional language features like new-style classes.<p>&quot;Kicking and screaming&quot; might have been an exaggeration, but it captures his overall attitude towards functional programming pretty well.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-python...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimi...</a>",1438235612

Some reasons have already been mentioned in the comments here:\n* Revenues - It&#x27;s already the dominant player in git hosting and has better enterprise plans,\n* Mindshare - GitHub is not just git hosting, it&#x27;s wikis, issues, gh-pages, atom, and more to come. Each of them are good products in their own right and also create a lot of value by being under the same roof.\n* Platform - Github is no longer a product, it&#x27;s an emerging platform. There are plugins / extensions that augment the power of GitHub; zenhub.io (as someone mentioned here) - a case in point.<p>And one point that every comment here has missed is Github&#x27;s value as a latent hiring marketplace. Unlike LinkedIn / Resumes / Referrals, a github profile is a much better signal for an employer. Punchcards, followers, projects built and contributed to build a very comprehensive visual of a developer, his coding style, tools used.

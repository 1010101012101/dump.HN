725436,comment,725191,725400,0,0,tolmasky,,,"Yes, as I clearly stated in my original post, the post office holds the mapping of ""address numbers"" to actual ""addresses"". (The same way that even addresses can be considered mappings to GPS locations). The key difference is that you now only have to update your address in one place (this official mapping). This is <i>not</i> how change of address forms work today. The post office will only <i>forward</i> your mail for one year, which means I still have to inform every single person that has my address that my address has changed, which is really silly in my opinion (like having to give everyone a new email address every time I purchased a new computer). The system I'm proposing is exactly equivalent to phone numbers, in that you don't care about calling a <i>location</i>, you care about calling a <i>person</i>.",1248673054

725418,comment,724756,725388,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's the difference between optimizing for lines of code <i>written</i> vs. lines of code <i>maintained</i>.  Many Java patterns exist so that when you need to make a change, you can change it in one place and have it propagate to every place you've used that abstraction.  This often means <i>more</i> lines of code in total, because you effectively have to put hooks into every place you're likely to change.<p>Whether or not this is a good tradeoff depends on two things:<p>1.) How much work will be spent in maintenance vs. how much will be spent writing the original program.<p>2.) How good your guesses are as to how the program will end up changing.  It does no good to add lots of hooks and abstractions if those hooks are in the wrong places.<p>Most of the ""Java sucks"" vs. ""Java is the only sane language"" battle comes from people not understanding that their answers to the above two questions are not likely to be the same as someone else's answers to the above two questions.  For startups, it's basically a given that your guesses on how the software will change are wrong, and therefore the layers of abstraction that common Java style encourages are just wasted.  Java really does suck for startups, unless you're using a platform where it's the only option (eg. mobile or IDE plugins).  But for large in-house IT departments, the vast majority of work is maintenance, and it's Somebody Else's Problem if the software doesn't quite fit requirements exactly.  Java makes a lot of sense in these environments.",1248672147

725412,comment,724756,724867,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I grew up with Java + IDEs and now work primarily with C++ + vim, and my experience is the opposite.  I feel that I'm much more productive <i>with</i> an IDE, as long as the computer is fast enough to support it (not always a given; Eclipse/Netbeans/IntelliJ are pigs).  I waste far more time switching between vim and xterm to run builds than I did hitting F5 in Netbeans.  And I just didn't make syntax errors in Java, because the IDE would instantly flag it when I did and I'd fix it immediately, while they still happen occasionally in C++.  I also spend far more time switching between Code Search windows than I did when I had type-aware autocompletion.<p>I suspect it's more that you'll be most productive in whichever environment you know best.  I spent 3 years in Java IDEs; I've spent 2 years doing JavaScript/Python/C++ dev in vim.  Given another year, they may reach parity.",1248671611

725409,comment,724963,725099,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Badri, I have a more radical argument: quality of education is <i>irrelevant</i> for the most part. Ultimately the real task of education (i.e imparting knowledge) is borne by the employer or done as a by-product (sometimes an accidental by-product) of a job. What the system achieved was a little bit of IQ filtering, a whole lot of placebo (""building confidence""), and an employer willing to offer a job to these graduates because they were ""qualified"". What most employers didn't realize was that most candidates became qualified <i>because</i> they were placed on a job!<p>If what I say above is true, we could dispense with the college and deliver the placebo faster and cheaper. Based on that premise, we performed the experiment at Zoho: we recruit directly out of high schools, and train people ourselves. I am happy to report that <i>it works</i> - which lends more evidence to the college-as-placebo hypothesis.",1248671266

I think people associate 'democracy' with all sorts of things that are not directly derivative, but the general idea is reasonable.<p>China does not have even the pretence of many institutions that are considered essential by many westerners. Democracy is one. Rule of law is another one that is usually lumped together (incorrectly, in my opinion) with democracy. A certain form of system neutrality is an important new world institution.<p>Another institution or value doesn't seem to have the right word. Libertarianism would be close but it carries far to much excess baggage, mostly US-specific.

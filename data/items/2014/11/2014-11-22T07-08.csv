8645101,comment,8644822,8644907,0,0,thirdsun,,,"I work for a small to mid-sized family business that existed for more than 30 years now, we have several stores and since 10 years ago have been manufacturing a physical product with mostly national recognition, but also some international interest. In terms of size I&#x27;m talking about ca. 50 employees.<p>Our &quot;IT-department&quot; is me and another employee, that is currently finishing his apprenticeship (the german model) and likely to stay with us. When I started 10 years ago I got in via an apprenticeship too. We usually look to train our people and keep them for a long time, if possible.<p>Since I haven&#x27;t been working for anyone else yet, I can&#x27;t compare, but it&#x27;s really satisfying working for a smaller, familiar and non-tech company. As you already mentioned technology and programming is needed everywhere, not just start ups. We develope our own internal CRM, POS system, websites and experimenting with lots of new stuff - sure, you could outsource these jobs, but our company is aware of the fact unless you spent a lot, you might and up with some lackluster solution that barely managed to tick off the bullet points. Doing this in-house offers a lot of freedom - we can choose our own technology, which is Rails for us, and if an employee/user comes up with an idea that would make his life easier, we are able to make it happen fast.<p>Plus, we feel valued, know the internal processes and requirements by heart and therefore are able to work on long-term goals, not just the current job&#x27;s specs. The company is also located in a rather rural area - this might not be to everyone&#x27;s taste, but rents and life in general is cheap around here, while the salary doesn&#x27;t differ that much from city-figures - while the rent certainly does. Overtime is a very rare thing, I work 7 am - 4 pm. I can get to work by bike in 10 minutes, rarely seeing a car along the way. The bottom line is a very comfortable situation for me - financially and in terms of quality of life.<p>tldr: If you look outside the usual tech-world, you might realize that your talent is needed almost everywhere and it can be very satisfying to work in your natural domain, but for non-tech companies.",1416643067

Previously, control surfaces were mechanically connected to the pilot&#x27;s controls.<p>> Typically a pilot will turn off the autopilot around 1000 feet and then do the rest for descent and subsequent landing.<p>This hasn&#x27;t been true anymore for about half a decade. Most landings are executed by autopilots. It depends on the airfield and weather and ...<p>A famous example was an event in 2006 for London Heathrow, when there was a period of about 3 weeks where the airport was autoland-only (has happened several times since then too). No human was allowed to land a plane there, but autopilots were. It resulted in two things, firstly a capacity reduction of about 40%, and a large amount of pressure on airlines to incorporate autoland features into their planes.<p>> Some things just can&#x27;t and should never be replaced. Is modern day technology meant to replace doctors?<p>Yes, definitely.

I&#x27;d prefer to invest in the other type of technology instead of chasing faddish stuff.<p>These days the benefits of this model of development (one page js app) is also hyped enough to drown out the fairly significant drawbacks - javascript behaves unpredictably under different browsers, is weakly typed, and the whole model breaks certain abstractions.

AI algorithms<p>1) have passed the turing test, then, indeed, we make the turing test more difficult.<p>(I would argue that if you give an accurate definition of a Turing test, namely &quot;convince, on occasion, a human that you&#x27;re human&quot;, that Eliza passed it in the 1960s)<p>2) several industries depend on their programs passing some sort of turing test every single day (ie. outsmarting humans directly, or outsmarting &quot;are you a human&quot; tests, automated or no). Examples : HFT (and HFT-like industries, like loan appraisal, credit validation, insurance brokering, ...), Spamming, police chatbots (&quot;Lolita&quot;, a US version and &quot;Sweetie&quot;, a British equivalent), Anti-spam, anti-HFT companies (who, for example, execute share buybacks for large companies), important parts of police work, ...<p>3) Some things are so AI-driven that nobody in their right mind still does it manually, or at least it is globally agreed that doing things manually results in a large competitive disadvantage (e.g. shipping).<p>4) There are places where the replacement of humans with AI has enabled new modes of operation that can not exist without AI. UAV&#x27;s being the big obvious example, but I would argue there&#x27;s a better one. AI has enabled bigger ships. Most of the 50000 ton + container ships have a turn radius of 50+ kilometers. If you don&#x27;t have clear vision 20 kilometers out, you cannot control these ships safely (just look for the yearly demonstration disaster of that fact in the Channel between Britain and France/Belgium). Then we started building 650000 ton ships. When it comes to planes, it&#x27;s not just UAVs that cannot be controlled by humans, but several kinds of fundamentally unstable planes have started flying, the big example being flying wing aircraft. But there&#x27;s plenty of others : UAVs, dynamic wing aircraft (like a bird or insect would be a good description), aircraft too light to have a human control them, ...<p>Let&#x27;s be fair here : this war was lost, a few years ago.

A simple explanation of amoebas behaviour can be found here[1], for example:<p><i>When an amoeba encounters a chemical that attracts it, the chemoattractant binds to receptors on the amoeba&#x27;s surface. The receptor then activates a protein called a G-protein, which activates a protein called PLC. The PLC modifies other molecules to create short-lived messengers that will activate other pathways necessary for movement by the cell.</i><p>The story is pretty similar for any other behaviour they exhibit, its just a simple chain of chemical reactions triggered by an impulse from an environment. In contrast to many more complicated organisms where we hypothetically know the same to be the case (like humans?), in unicellular organisms we actually traced many of such pathways.<p>People very emotionally cling to their beliefs about intelligence, and this blinds them to simple logic. This is the same thing at operation that caused the backslash against evolution theory. In the end I don&#x27;t see why such determinism would sadden anyone, our everyday experience is what it is and its nature is not changed by learning that we react, in the end, somewhat automatically.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ehow.com/info_8517923_ways-amoeba-sees-responds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ehow.com/info_8517923_ways-amoeba-sees-responds.h...</a>",1416641238

After categorizing the types of definitions, Shane Legg successfully used &quot;Property of an agent that interacts with its environment so as to successfully achieve goals across a wide range of environments&quot;[1] for his work in AI.<p>What Alva Noë is hinting at is the flaw with weak or pseudo-intelligence, as Alva calls it. As impressive as deep blue is with chess, or Watson with Jeopardy, they fail the &quot;goals across a wide range of environments&quot; test. This is clear with deep blue, and Watson once you realize it&#x27;s just a glorified search engine.<p>I often hear people claim Watson learns because it improves based on the answer in the category. While it does use previous answers to tweak the final ranking algorithm. All of this is lost once the category is finished. To really &quot;teach&quot; Watson, you need to add more data to its index and re-index offline.<p>We have a workable definition of intelligence. What we&#x27;re missing is a fundamental primitive unit of strong AI.

8645039,comment,8644175,8644955,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Ah, the innocence of the engineer on the cusp of a new management position.<p>This is more or less what every engineer thinks when they start a &quot;bridge position&quot;. Very few survive, because the reality is that the management world is much different than the world we engineers are used to, even after we have a lot of experience as an employed engineer. We think that since we&#x27;ve seen a lot of bosses come and go and met and talked to a lot of them, we know what works and what doesn&#x27;t, etc. It&#x27;s not like that. Management plays by a whole different rule book.<p>When it comes down to it, management is primarily a psychological position. Soft things matter <i>much</i> more than hard, measurable things. Engineers live in a meritocracy, even if they think their employer is bad about that. The numbers and/or code work and have merit, or they don&#x27;t. Someone is right and someone is wrong.<p>Management is the opposite extreme. Your job is to keep your reports happy so that they do the job the company wants to do them as well as possible. Yes, some of that involves acquiring resources and removing barriers to implementation (the part we engineers naturally think of, and have a lot of ideas about how to improve), but <i>most</i> of it involves making sure that <i>everyone</i> likes you as far as is possible, and that in cases where something that makes someone unhappy must be done, the lowest-value person is affected in the least direct way, such that they don&#x27;t stay off your side for very long. When you are a manager, you are really a full-time politician. To be successful, you must always be campaigning, not on issues that matter or on the most correct or meritorious position, but on whatever will make you most liked, as broadly as possible.<p>When this was me, I didn&#x27;t anticipate the heaviness of the political aspect. I thought as long as I was more or less right and proved myself, it would be fine. I thought that if I fought for righteous causes, the truth would bare out and we&#x27;d all win. What I had to accept is that this is not how the real world works. I was forced out before my first project even had a chance to wrap. I don&#x27;t think I was overtly rude to anyone; the issue is that when you&#x27;re a boss, people nitpick and look for things to be offended about. You have to actively counteract that. If you do something adverse to someone, even something you think is miniscule, you must do it in the most gentle way possible and really think about it. If you don&#x27;t do anything bad but aren&#x27;t <i>as nice</i> as some of the other bosses, that will come back to bite you too.<p>I made a powerful enemy just by politely taking a rain check on a lunch invitation. I thought that was fine and not a big deal, because everyone knew we&#x27;re all really busy and that having lunch is not a major priority for most people. Turns out, it&#x27;s not fine.<p>I made several not-powerful enemies because I didn&#x27;t regularly pay for everyone&#x27;s lunch or bring in donuts, cookies, or some other type of treat, which a couple of the other guys did. It doesn&#x27;t matter that nothing in my job description involved procuring donuts or lunch for everyone. It doesn&#x27;t matter that I was very generous in other ways. It doesn&#x27;t matter that I would rather spend that half-hour that I would&#x27;ve spent waiting in line at the donut shop on actual work, like writing a few extra tests or even sitting in a pointless management-level meeting where nothing got decided. All that mattered was that some other guys did this thing, and I didn&#x27;t. I was expecting people to note these other things and care, but they didn&#x27;t care because they didn&#x27;t benefit directly and personally. I wasn&#x27;t running a tight campaign. A tight campaign wouldn&#x27;t have let any other employee at any level be more popular or more important.<p>The problem, of course, was that I didn&#x27;t go into it to be a politician; I went into it to build awesome stuff and have authority to see it done the right way. Once you&#x27;re a manager, the only thing that you should care about building anymore is your personal reputation within the ranks. (I&#x27;ve found this to also be true if you want any room to negotiate as a non-management employee.) Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s better for the company long-term. That&#x27;s not going to help you. All it means is that they&#x27;ll still be around to fire you. What matters is that you&#x27;re exploiting your position to groom your personality cult. Nothing else will help you, because most people do not understand anything else.<p>One could argue that these are exceptional situations, but I don&#x27;t really think they are. Maybe someone else would find some other minor thing to nitpick, but they&#x27;d still do it. <i>Everything</i> you do reflects back on you, and it&#x27;s not about merit or correctness anymore. It&#x27;s about feelings -- feelings that are completely and utterly unreasonable, as feelings often are. When you become a manager, you are the steward of feelings. It becomes your job to ensure everyone on your team is all good feelings and, furthermore, that <i>everyone else</i> in the whole company is all good feelings too, and it gets <i>very</i> personal. Most people cannot make a decision based on the merit of something, they can only make decisions based on appearances.<p>After trying my hand at this for a while, I decided that I&#x27;d much rather stick to coding. Managers become managers because they don&#x27;t know what else to do with themselves. They are forced to live in the ghetto dictated by irrational, unpredictable human emotion that engineers usually consider something that was left in junior high. Once you get into pretty much any other field, any field where empirical thought processes are not a fundamental component of the day-to-day workload, you realize that ghetto never really got left behind by any of your non-technical peers; it&#x27;s the only world they know how to live in.<p>Good luck man.",1416640606

I found my current outsourced team from a very strong recommendation. Why are recommendations so powerful? Because we&#x27;re lazy. It&#x27;s hard to weed through random proposals from strangers when someone you trust has used someone successfully. But referrals only happen after you, excellent developer, have a few jobs under your belt. And that&#x27;s given that you have past clients that aren&#x27;t trying to hoard you. Would they recommend you to their friends if you&#x27;re slow on the projects you&#x27;re working on with them?<p>As a marketing director at a small travel company if I want my Magento website upgraded for speed, or if I want the current theme made responsive, where do I go? Well the CEO wants ROI, so I&#x27;m under pressure to find the balance of cost and quality output. So that means I try to outsource to developing countries for <$50/hr. What if you&#x27;re a $100+/hr American developer? Well as a marketing director that reports to the CEO, I have to completely cover my ass in order to recommend something at $100/hr. Doesn&#x27;t matter that the going rate for the best devs in tech cities might bill out at $500/hr - he&#x27;s comparing to the Indian company from 2 years ago, to his sales team, and to his accountant.<p>If you want to bill at market rate++ you sure as hell better propose something in such a way that the projected savings or new revenue is much higher than your cost. A CEO or Director of Marketing WILL pay what you&#x27;re worth if the ROI is 125%+. You probably can&#x27;t guarantee anything since so much is dependent on the company you&#x27;re working with. But you have to paint the picture of possibility. In the perfect world, how well can what your proposing help the company? If you cover all the technical bases and point out the other areas of the project that the sales team, the marketing team, the customer support team has to contribute to, well that&#x27;s a much easier sell.<p>ROI, ROI, ROI. That&#x27;s what people who hire you think about, especially in non-tech industries. All business people think of this first. Business people understand long term investment and don&#x27;t expect your $10k project to product $20k the next month, but you have to help paint the picture. Will it pay off in 6 months? 9 months? 2 years? Make it easy for them, and the sale is easier.<p>How do non-tech sectors know they need a programmer? There&#x27;s almost always the techiest person at any company that is designated to hire the programming help or falls into it. You don&#x27;t have to convince the secretary, the CEO, the accountant, the COO and the marketing director. You only have to convince the person handling the project that tends to be the most tech-savvy. A smart CEO generally won&#x27;t put a 60-year-old secretary on the hunt for a genius RoR developer. He&#x27;ll designate the best staff he has available.<p>What triggers that moment where they go from mentioning it in passing, to calling a meeting and saying &quot;we need to hire a developer in the next two weeks&quot;? Usually it&#x27;s obvious things that don&#x27;t need to be uncovered by developers. The ecommerce payment system stops working; someone looks at the site on their iPad and realizes it looks like crap; they stop getting automated emails.<p>The power you hold is painting a beautiful picture of what&#x27;s possible with technology, and making they understand, then believe your vision.

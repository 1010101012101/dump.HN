10611654,comment,10608540,10611639,0,0,karpathy,,,"So here&#x27;s what&#x27;s funny about the leaderboard. The NeuralTalk submission (near bottom of the list) is in fact a re-implementation of the Show and Tell model (my paper and Oriol&#x27;s are basically identical models - we plug in the top of the CNN to an RNN on first time step. Except I use vanilla RNN and he used an LSTM (which turns out to work a bit better)). But it&#x27;s an identical model - in that submission I had in fact used the LSTM implementation in NeuralTalk.<p>What&#x27;s different between the two is the engineering portion: NeuralTalk was written in Python and ran on CPU without batches (so probably it did not converge as well), it did not do CNN finetuning (which helps a ton), and it did not do ensembles, and I used VGG while Oriol used GoogLeNet (though I don&#x27;t expect much difference there). There are a few more tricks that Oriol talks about that give you a few small extra points, but that&#x27;s basically it. I also don&#x27;t want to take away from Oriol&#x27;s top result (these small tricks and engineering are very valuable and hard to come up with), but I would be hesitant to draw conclusions about which models work best by looking at the model diagrams in a Figure, and comparing to numbers in the table.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve over time grown cynical about results in tables of papers that compare one work to another - there are too many variables to keep track of and it&#x27;s confusing unless you know the full details. The truth is that results in tables are model + engineering + noise. The papers pretend that it&#x27;s all model, but in fact the latter 2 have a huge impact. At least results that only compare two models in the same framework can be trusted a bit more to contain information, but even then you find that in practice people can be a lot more generous to their own models than their baselines. Hence the famous saying: &quot;The second best model in the paper is in fact what you want to use&quot;.<p>To answer the original question though: The idea presented in Show Attend and Tell (spatial attention during caption generation) is clearly good and if compared properly I&#x27;m confident would turn out to work better. Also, the Berkeley paper seemed to have a nice architecture where there was a 2-layer LSTM but the image was only plugged in on the second layer (1st layer was an image-independent Language Model). In their controlled experiments this seemed to work well, I think it&#x27;s an interesting idea, and I&#x27;d want to try to reproduce it. The models presented in my work and Oriol&#x27;s are the simplest architecture that has the core nugget of the approach and that gets the job done, but I&#x27;d expect many bells and whistles on top of this to work better.",1448229533

I really don&#x27;t get it.<p>Before - use chef/puppet to manage dependencies, distribute config files. run processes. maybe use something like upstart to restart on failure.<p>After - use Dockerfiles to manage dependencies (same thing, bunch of install commands). now you have a container for the web app, one for another service, etc.  so everything is isolated.. great. what do you gain over running 2 separate processes? thats pretty damn isolated too.. except for the same disk, they each have own virtual memory, state, config files etc..<p>I&#x27;m not a (modern) ops expert at all, but i know my way around the command line.

By marking something as private you&#x27;re saying &quot;I, as a developer sat here writing this know better than all of the users of my library. Their lives may depend on using something I haven&#x27;t exposed properly in my API, but too bad. I know best&quot;.<p>So you end up jumping through ridiculous hoops to access private properties (because even in languages with private, nothing is <i>truly</i> private), all because some guy thought he knows best a long time ago while writing the library you are using.<p>So a better approach (IMO) is to mark something as private with convention (a prefixed underscore), which means &quot;this is private, don&#x27;t depend on it&quot;, without restricting your access. You can drive a car, have sex, pay taxes, but not access a private variable? Bleugh.<p>That&#x27;s more of a cultural thing though, I&#x27;m sure enforced private makes more sense in statically typed, compiled languages with lots of classes (and even then I would argue they are still bad for the reasons above), and matter more in huge codebases.",1448229423

A minimum wage job qt $7.25 plus $1,000/month grosses $27,080.<p>2. A Basic Income improves the outcome of children in poor families. Two minimum wage-earning parents plus $1,000/month per adult yields $54,160: Reduces divorce rate, reduces domestic violence, enables residence in a better neighborhood and attendance to better schools.<p>3. An improved outcome for children also means lower crime rates.<p>4. Lower crime rates improve real estate values. Anecdotally, from 1998 to 2006, East Palo Alto median home prices increased from $190,000 to $650,000 (342%). Over the same time period, the total crimes reported dropped from 550 to 350 (was over 900 in 1988) [0]. (note that the median home price has not further increased since 2006).<p>5. There are about 3,600 detached single housing units. [1]. With a little arithmetic, the  total increase in the value of the real estate owned by those owners was $1,656,000,000.<p>6. A basic income of $1,000 per month for East Palo Alto over those 8 years would have cost $1,824,000,000.[1]<p>7. Property tax receipts increased somewhat. The county gets 1% annually, but due to prop 13, that will take a long while to fully materialize.<p>8. Sales tax receipts would likely increase as the population would have $228,000,000 more to spend each year.<p>So, if it is true that a basic income would reduce crime and lower crime rates improve real estate prices, then part of the economic analysis of a basic income needs to factor that in.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/EPA_Main_Report_Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/EPA_Main_Report_Final.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/cities/EastPaloAlto.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/cities/EastPaloAlto.htm</a><p><i>Mods, please add &#x27;anecdotally&#x27; to the spell check dictionary</i>",1448229085

The intelligence agencies exist to provide whatever fiction those in power wish to hear.  In the 80s, the CIA determined that the USSR was a paper tiger destined for collapse.  But Reagan wanted an enemy.  So the higher-ups at the CIA took the report by the head of their USSR division and threw it away, crafting their own fictional representation of the USSR as a powerhouse.  This is why every major world event comes as a huge surprise to the CIA and other intelligence agencies.  It doesn&#x27;t surprise any of the analysts working there, they actually know what is going on most of the time.  But because the truth is not politically convenient, the agency as a whole cannot be made to seem like a danger to the political machinations of those who influence their funding.  Some of the gymnastics this involves are sometimes funny.  Reading the CIAs reports on Iran&#x27;s &#x27;nuclear weapons program&#x27;, for instance, are an adventure in absurdism.  Pile after pile of pages of extensive descriptions of total knowledge of Iran&#x27;s operations culminating in not a single shred of evidence of any weapons program gets topped off with &quot;but then again, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. There could be a super-duper-extra-top-secret weapons program buried 50 miles underground&quot; which gives the politicos and media the ability to report it as &quot;CIA says Iran may have secret weapons program in new report!&quot;<p>Oh, and that head of the CIAs USSR division whose report showing the truth of the USSRs weakness was Aldritch Aimes.  It was at that point that he realized the intelligence game was a sham and just being used to lend an air of mystique and &#x27;secret knowledge&#x27; to whatever position those in power want to make seem legitimate and decided if everyone else was just playing a game, he might as well play to, and cut a deal with the Russians to act as a double agent.",1448228678

If there&#x27;s a bubble in privately owned tech companies, the impact will probably not be nearly as severe - the people who&#x27;ll be hurt are VCs, investors in VC funds and the founders and employees of startup companies. There will probably be a correction in larger tech stocks like Google, Facebook and Apple as well, but they&#x27;ll probably recover once (1) the markets see that that the problems with startups don&#x27;t affect these larger companies&#x27; earnings very much and (2) money that previously went into VC funds shifts into established tech companies.<p><i>&quot;Specifically, I don&#x27;t understand why a lot of startups being heavily funded will cause a bubble.&quot;</i><p>The problem (according to the people who think there&#x27;s a bubble) is that there&#x27;s too much investor capital chasing too few high-quality startups, so low-quality startups (e.g., ones that have unrealistic business models that have little chance of ever becoming profitable) are getting a lot of money, and they&#x27;ll eventually collapse and freak out potential investors. That could cause funding for all startups to suddenly get much harder to get. An analogy with the housing crisis is that once the investors ran out of prime mortgages to collateralize, they started putting money in sub-prime mortgages given to homeowners who had little chance of being able to pay them off in the long term.<p><i>&quot;How will the bubble burst impact employees who are in a well funded startup?&quot;</i><p>Start-ups looking for additional rounds of funding could be hit by investors pulling out of VC funds, making additional funding hard to get. Companies that are still in a stage where they&#x27;re not profitable could have difficulty staying afloat once they burn through their current round of funding.",1448228569

To meet the demand for meat, we have grown the poultry and cattle&#x27;s population accordingly, increasing the energy, water and food spendings uphill (after all, they too need to be nourished). Especially in the US, to maintain low prices, those who set the customer price (such as McDonalds) have been forced to rationalise the whole chain of production, putting a lot of stress and liability on farmers.<p>However, the human population is still accelerating tremendously, and meat is still among the most costly food per kilogram we eat, not in terms of money spent by the customer, but in terms of energy wasted along the whole chain.<p>Fishing has a similar crisis; regulation became necessary to maintain fish population to a sustainable level, and avoid having fish locations simply disappear.<p>At a fundamental level, the reason life can thrive on earth is energy from the sun and the Earth converted to plants which are consumed by animals and fungi. Every step of consumption between plants and humans is wasted energy, given that the planet&#x27;s energy is not limitless, and that we humans must tap that supply carefully if we ever hope to colonize another planet.",1448227988

They extract a single kind of stem cell from an animal, coax it into becoming a muscle fiber, and grow lots of those fibers.

It also has at least one thing added that &quot;meat&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily: antibiotics.

They might for example recommend doing the storage inside the docker container, and have the data disappear whenever the container disappears. This might be a little less reliable or transparent, but since you have a redundant cluster you can always restore the data from some other container.

This is already useful for research and some tissue banking (embryos, corneas, etc). If improvements continue, it could allow for organ banking. But the brain is an organ, and cryopreservation technologies work quite well on it. For example, 21st Century Medicine can take a slice of a rat&#x27;s hippocampus, cryopreserve it, and thaw it. Afterwards, it&#x27;s still viable tissue.[2] This is very important, as the hippocampus is not only crucial for memory consolidation, but it&#x27;s the part of the brain most vulnerable to ischemic damage (especially the CA1 region).<p>21st Century Medicine has also experimented with whole organs. They&#x27;ve taken a kidney from a rabbit, cryopreserved it, thawed it, and transplanted it back into the rabbit. Then, after removing the remaining kidney, the vitrified-and-thawed kidney kept the rabbit alive indefinitely. Alcor uses the same cryoprotectants as this experiment.<p>If cryonics works, this is <i>exactly</i> the sort of evidence you&#x27;d expect to see today. Granted, it probably won&#x27;t work, but the expected value is positive.<p>1.

It&#x27;s more that the model is seeing an image that is out of sample, but our approach _forces_ it to say something, so it will do its best but usually fail.<p>One simple low-hanging-fruit approach would be to include a large repository of additional data (e.g. all of ImageNet) and label it all as a &quot;garbage&quot; class. This way the model could at least learn to distinguish the kinds of images in its training data from the universe of images, and this could be used as one proxy of confidence.<p>Another simple proxy is to look at the probability of the generated sample, since usually the model tends to assign more diffuse probabilities in more uncertain cases. But this is also not a very clean approach for various reasons.<p>Another, and probably most appealing, approach would be something along the lines of Bayesian Neural Networks, ensembles, or approximations with dropout, where the disagreement between the predictions of all submodels can be used.",1448226510

Obviously having a homegrown orchestrator is not very nice. There&#x27;s bounds to be lots of edgecases that our ops will run into that&#x27;ll continuously cause us to perform maintenance on it, and maintaining an orchestration framework is not our core business.<p>Anyway, this is not necessarily a critique of Kubernetes, it&#x27;s great software.

10611487,comment,10605230,10610406,0,0,nemo,,,"Many museums are privately owned and funded - the luckier ones have endowments.  While some items are donated by patrons, when items show up on the market museums do purchase them.  This isn&#x27;t really a government funding problem, most museums in the US get most of their funding from private donations.  (While ancient manuscript fragments are purchased by museums, the larger collections are held by academic libraries, and while those do need public funding, they typically do have the ability to purchase items relevant to their collections.)<p>The reasons things got complex here was that the private party was selling an antiquity through an odd venue (a lot of antiquities are sold on eBay, but it&#x27;s mostly common items of less historic interest).  These sort of things would usually be sold through Sothebys, or Christie&#x27;s, or some other auction house where they&#x27;d catalog the item, and make sure researchers and interested parties would be aware.  This one slipped under the radar until the researcher at UT spotted it because of the fact that it was on eBay.  This item turned out to be a highly historically significant find discovered by researchers too late for an institutional purchase (which is a slow process), and sold in a way that doesn&#x27;t fit typical institutional purchase models.<p>There&#x27;s also tension between academic researchers and antiquities collectors that this helped exacerbate.  Antiquities collectors are seen by researchers as encouraging looting of archaeological sites and of buying historically significant items and harming the public at large by preventing the possibility of research.  Many antiquities collectors, and especially dealers have their own low opinions of academics as well.",1448226410

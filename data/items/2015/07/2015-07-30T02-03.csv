Which meaning you choose to wield says a lot about your biases.<p>You will accept that a large chunk of modern history saw women deprived of basic rights. Recent legislation may have made a dent, but hundreds of years of behavior and social structure do not vanish overnight. In this light, feminism emerges as a <i>mode of analysis</i> that seeks to understand how male-supremacy operates in society to elevate men and denigrate women. It is also a form of <i>activism</i> that seeks to correct the imbalance.<p>It means other things too. But since you clearly have an unsubtle and unsympathetic viewpoint, your point of view is frankly not relevant. You don&#x27;t get to define it. Instead, consider talking less and listening more.

I might be totally wrong here, but I&#x27;m kinda interested in what the split is.<p>Obviously every software company having a huge chance of keeping their private source control code in you is a big deal, and even &quot;monetize way later&quot; makes sense here considering the dominance they are showing.<p>And mostly showing without any major improvements to the product (.com) in a LOOOOONG time, but I will say the stability has gotten much better, and I do appreciate that at least.",1438221853

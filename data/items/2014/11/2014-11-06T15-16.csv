8567559,comment,8552487,8565312,0,0,geebee,,,"We probably disagree about the extent to which the chance of a bad placement is &quot;large&quot;.  I have two kids in SFUSD, and I really do believe that if you do your research and create a balanced list of good schools (without focusing on the &quot;trophy&quot; schools, your odds of getting a good school placement reasonably close to home (certainly closer than you&#x27;d get with a local school in the burbs) is good.  That said, yes, there is a chance you&#x27;ll be disappointed and need to look for other options, and this simply doesn&#x27;t happen in well off suburbs, where you can convert a high mortgage payment into a guaranteed spot for your kid in a high performing school.<p>So even though I disagree with you that the odds of a bad placement is &quot;large&quot; (I&#x27;d say it is non-trivial rather than large, but I don&#x27;t have numbers either) this process appeals more to poor or middle income people than wealthy ones.  If you&#x27;re poor or middle income, you&#x27;re choosing between no chance of a good school (you can&#x27;t afford the top districts in the burbs) and a decent chance (SF).  For a rich person, you&#x27;re choosing between a guarantee (burbs) and a decent change (SF).  Again, we disagree about &quot;large&quot;.<p>One thing - have you looked at greatschools.net and checked out the number of elementary schools in SF with high test scores?  SFUSD a very high performing urban district. It&#x27;s fine to disagree, but if you haven&#x27;t done this yet, I really do urge you to review the data before forming your opinion.  I think the notion that SF schools are mainly bad is an incorrect myth.  There are problems, but the notion that good elementary schools are few and far between is false.<p>High schools aren&#x27;t quite as good, but they aren&#x27;t nearly as bad as people make them out to be (it&#x27;s not just Lowell - check out the data.  Balboa high, in a relatively low income southern part of SF, scores as high as many reasonably good suburban districts).<p>Middle schools seem to be the weak link right now, though again, please review the data before forming your opinion - the conventional wisdom is almost always more dire than the reality where it comes to sfusd.  Middle school is a tricky one - you may notice that the private model rarely splits out 6-8 grades, going with the k-8 model, so the entire approach may be flawed here...",1415289281

8567539,comment,8567134,8567134,0,0,feyn,,,"I’ve been in a technical lead position across 5 companies over the last 10 years, and after trying just about everything written or spoken about influencing team code quality, I finally found a formula that works:<p>1) Take on the most brutal coding tasks/features yourself.  You will have to cherry-pick the upcoming work to look for things that just about any other engineer would freak out about if they got it assigned to them.<p>2) Knock it out of the park in terms of time-to-market <i></i>and<i></i> code quality.  You need to do both, to eliminate the concern of, “We don’t have time to write quality code.”   The code should be so clean, so well factored, so well unit tested, that you would be comfortable getting a code review from Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, and Bob Martin all at the same time.  This also implies that you’re read their books, and would know how to pass their code review.<p>3) Call a code review with the entire team, and aggressively code review your own code.  There is always room for improvement in any code, depending on hour you interpreted current requirements and future needs.  This has to include phrases like, “I didn’t know what to do here so I…”, “I really which I had more time to change this to…”, “I went back-and-forth on how best to abstract this, but ultimately I chose this abstraction because.”  Basically, you’re looking to show them the worst possible code review on the best possible code.<p>4) Depending on the personalities involved (including your own), decide how you are going to coach each engineer 1-on-1.  No two people are alike, so you will need to dial your approach to each person.  Some people will thing you are a show-off, some will think you intimidating, as well any another other human emotion and concern that causes someone to not seek out or not take advice.  This is where your emotional IQ and communication skills will be tested.<p>5) When you start coaching them, don’t go after every single flaw.  Try to find the underlying root cause of the problem in the code, and address that.   A common problem I run into is the people just don’t understand OOP but think they do.  I usually have to coach them on basics like encapsulation and cohesion, working them up to design patterns, and further up to domain modeling, all the while instructing on proper implementation technique (such as unit testing.)  Once they have the fundamentals in place, you can begin fine-tuning certain implementation patterns.<p>6) Over time, at least one member of your team will get good.  With their permission, publicly review their code.  In this, you want to be very positive: “I like what they did here…”, “That’s a good way to encapsulate that problem”, “That’s a powerful abstraction, especially the way it’s used…”   This Rite of Passage should then become what other engineers are striving for, as only the best engineers are getting public praise fests.<p>This basic formula has served me very well with my current team, in that they are one-upping themselves on code-quality.   Still, however, I take on the most grueling coding tasks to set the example and lead from the front.  This acts to continue to demonstrate my commitment to code quality, as well and lets the team know I would not ask them to do something that I would not do myself.",1415289058

I do.<p>I have 8 direct reports and I review every single line of code that they write. Some days this is all I do.<p>Others think I&#x27;m crazy but our group outperforms every other group by any measure. I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s because of peer review.<p>A few thoughts:<p>1. Regarding resources and timelines: It&#x27;s not when you start, it&#x27;s when you finish. Every hour of peer review saves me at least 10 hours on the back end (systems testing, regression testing, user acceptance testing) and 100 hours on the back/back end (maintenance).<p>2. I never have to tell anyone anything more than once. I make sure I explain why. (When you do <x>, you cause <y>.) Then they learn and remember. This is not a religious debate; it&#x27;s a way of conducting business. This won&#x27;t work nearly as well if people are more interested in showing what they know than learning how to do it properly.<p>3. As I get to know different people, I know where I can skim and where I have to focus. I rarely return much to senior people. I often return a lot to junior people.<p>4. Everyone makes mistakes, even senior people, and even me. Peer review, like regression testing, is a pain in the ass, but it more than pays for itself on the back end.<p>5. As soon as you feel you&#x27;re ready, you&#x27;re senior people can take some of the peer review workload. I have done this before, but it hasn&#x27;t lasted because of turnover.<p>6. Once people know everything will be peer reviewed, they become more careful about what they&#x27;re doing.<p>7. Technical debt is a huge timebomb. I know of no better way of slowing it down than 100% peer review.<p>8. Everything is documented in the ticket. This provides some feedback on how it&#x27;s working and what should be changed (programming standards, peer review methods, etc.)<p>9. Once you put your phone away, get off the internet, and stop going to useless meetings, it&#x27;s amazing how much more time you have to do things that really make a difference, like peer review.<p>10.

Let me tell you the obvious : the best code I see has these problems, because the best code is the best code because it uses the language to it&#x27;s maximum effect, which often precludes having perfect &quot;style&quot;. The best code is tested in functional ways, which means that it doesn&#x27;t have &quot;good coverage&quot;, nor does it really use unit tests more than a little bit.<p>And the worst code I see, by people who learned to code a month ago or worse and don&#x27;t know any algorithms (but feel like they know better than people who&#x27;ve studied algorithms and languages for years) almost without exception perfectly styled. It contains moronic errors like swapping variables around (because these programmers do not know how to use the type system), it contains 5 unit tests for every single little function, because that increases the lines of code metric that is so universally used. And the reason for half the lines of good is &quot;good practices&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s how you recognize good code : firstly it is not possible to shorten it without causing a MAJOR disaster in the readability area. Every concern is properly separated out into it&#x27;s own pieces of code, and aside from the (short) main function there is very little single-purpose code. The typing system is used well. Prices and amounts are NOT the same data type, for example, and cannot be obviously switched. Unit tests exist for core algorithmic pieces only and other than that there are system tests that confront the code with real-world situations while running almost the entire program, ideally under heavy load with half the backend unresponsive, and has a statement that says the test fails if it takes longer than 1/10th of a second. It implicitly follows and beautifully implements a design document that is not written in word, but in a 10 to 15 line comment on top of the file/class.<p>Note the issues :
1) hardcoding things
2) naming mistakes<p>Both of the issues you complain about can be fixed mechanically or with absolutely minimal supervision through refactoring. Yet next to all the comments below suggest DOUBLING the manual effort needed to get code into the repository. While automated fixing might be problemating, writing linters that detect these problems is trivial.<p>Unless of course the problem is that you feel that you need to fix how others program because you &quot;know better&quot;, but can&#x27;t actually write code checkers. In this case, why are you leading them ?<p>So well in that case I&#x27;d advise a slice of humble pie, and a compilers course.<p>> I review commits now and then and find some of these issues - but due to the nature and timeline of the project cannot do it for each and ever commit of course.<p>You sound like someone with an MBA. A programmer would recognize this for what is is : a problem screaming to be automated. Code commits can be made dependant on code checkers succeeding - just write the ones you want/need. Can&#x27;t do that ? You&#x27;re not a programmer - or at least not a good one - and stop whining about how difficult programming is - learn it first.",1415288333

What works for one team at one point in time might be horrible for other groups. Having said that, here are some things that have worked for me:<p>* If some of the people on the team have more skills than others, you could try asking people to pair program for part of the day. You could try setting up a lab space for this if people are interested.<p>* Weekly brown bag sessions where you talk about a technical topic of interest. Let people on the team nominate ideas. Do it over lunch and have the company have food delivered. The better the food, the more people will want to attend.<p>* You should get an automated build in place, and encourage people to do some level of automated testing if they aren&#x27;t already. Some people take this a step further and use the automated tests to help drive out the design (Test-Driven Development by Kent Beck is a good book on this topic).<p>* You could try starting a technical book club where people read a chapter a week, and then get together and discuss it over lunch. Given your situation, I&#x27;d strongly recommend starting with &quot;The Practice of Programming&quot; by Kernighan and Pike. Again, it helps a lot to have the company get good food delivered.<p>Don&#x27;t make a million changes at once. I might start with the book club if I were in your position. None of this stuff will magically transform your team, but these kinds of things can start creating a culture where people start to care more about the quality of their work. You&#x27;ll encounter people who have very strong religious feelings for or against any one of the things I listed above, usually based on some past experience. I&#x27;ve seen each of the above succeed big and fail hard with different groups. Just try what seems to make the most sense for your team.<p>One last note: when you try things, don&#x27;t do stuff in fits and starts - talk with the team about what you&#x27;re going to do, see if there&#x27;s buy in, and if there is, commit to trying it for, say, four weeks. After the four week period is done, talk with the team about whether or not it&#x27;s working for them, and if they&#x27;d like to stop or continue. Over time, you can add/remove/change more things in the same manner.<p>Good luck!",1415288302

To start with, pick a set of command code standards and style guidelines.  Google has nice ones for many languages that you can use as a starting point (<a href=""https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/</a>).<p>Secondly, enforce them through automated tools (e.g. in a Java shop, these might include PMD, FindBugs, Checkstyle, etc).  Have everyone install the IDE plugins for those tools (along with your common config).  Incorporate them into your continuous integration build process.  Perhaps put in place a static analysis tool like Sonar to send regular reports on code issues.<p>The human element would start by having someone review committed code before it&#x27;s allowed to be merged downstream.  Git&#x27;s pull requests, along with diff view systems like GitHub&#x27;s, make this easy... but you can use workable practices with Subversion or whatever also.<p>There are limits to &quot;pull request&quot;-based code reviews, though.  When change sets grow too large, it&#x27;s difficult for the reviewer to understand the high-level vision for the changes.  You start reviewing the trees, rather than the forest.  So I think you still need periodic in-person code reviews, to walk through the state of a codebase at certain milestones and discuss higher-level issues.<p>----- CONTINUING EDUCATION SIDE -----<p>The thing that I&#x27;ve seen work best here is a regular, ongoing lunch-and-learn type series.  Take any of the standard code quality treatises (e.g. &quot;Pragmatic Programmer&quot;, &quot;Code Complete&quot;, &quot;Clean Code&quot;, etc), and tackle a chapter per week.  Better yet, split up the chapters and have the team members themselves present a chapter.  It&#x27;s great experience for them (if they&#x27;re not TOO freaked out by public speaking), and you&#x27;ll never learn something as deeply as you do through the process of teaching it to others.<p>The problem with lunch-n-learns is that you MUST have buy-in from management to make them a serious and ongoing part of your team culture.  When deadlines are tight and there are fires to put out (and when are there not?), a lot of companies are quick to cancel that week&#x27;s lunch-n-learn.  When that happens, they lose traction and fall apart.",1415287883

I genuinely don&#x27;t know. What&#x27;s wrong with docker? Docker can&#x27;t move containers. Surely that can be solved (IFF it can be solved) easier than creating all this contraption from scratch. Docker is supposed to run processes while they seem to want to run full Linux distributions. Is that it? I don&#x27;t know. Why do they even want to run full Linux distribution? We don&#x27;t know.

8567392,comment,8565011,8565564,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"Price discrimination is the means by which a producer captures the consumer benefit to trade.<p>Let&#x27;s go back to Econ 101.  Draw your price axis vertically, and your quantity axis horizontally.  Make a big &#x27;X&#x27; for supply and demand curves.  Draw horizontal and vertical lines through the intersection point in the X to the axes.<p>You just found the market-clearing price and quantity.<p>There should be a triangle above that horizontal line and below the demand curve.  That area represents the consumer benefit to trade.  It&#x27;s what people would have paid, but didn&#x27;t have to.  Below the line and above the supply curve is the producer benefit to trade.  It&#x27;s extra money people got above what they would have ordinarily accepted for their goods.<p>When a supplier has multiple price levels, it is trying to capture more of the total benefit of trade by grabbing rectangular chunks out of the consumers&#x27; area.<p>The <i>fair</i> thing to do is set one price for everybody, exactly at the market-clearing price.  When you take the consumer benefit, they have less money in their pockets than they should, and that distorts the demand curve for every other good and service in the market.  You are essentially waging war upon every other supplier, for the money of every consumer that does not participate in producing your specific good.<p>The cinema should price tickets such that they fill every seat in the viewing room by showtime.  (Or actually, for information purposes, try for one empty seat.)  If you price-discriminate, the people who paid the most for tickets might not be buying popcorn, or eating out at the restaurant across the street before the show, or grabbing ice cream afterward.  The &quot;fair&quot; way to get more of their money is to try to sell them more goods and services than the cheapskates.  Upsell them on first-class seating, or let them buy the right to request a 10-minute intermission so they can hit the bathrooms without missing any of the show, or give them organic popcorn with grass-fed butter instead of diacetyl-flavored soybean oil.<p>As both a consumer and a producer of other goods, I say it is bullshit, it is wrong, and it should stop.  It is not quite as bad for me as it is for other people, because Amazon employs a lot of software professionals directly, but it is undeniably anti-competitive behavior.  If every producer did it, people would buy less of everything, because as consumers, they would seldom see any benefit to trading.  We would be wasting quite a lot of time haggling, and end up with fewer goods and services.<p>Your cinema argument comes from the perspective that the owner is somehow robbed by trading more.  If the fixed price is 10, he earns 20. If it is 7, he earns 84.  If it is 4, he earns 52.  His supply curve is not flat.  It is more stair-stepped, representing the fixed costs of opening an entire viewing room, the smaller variable costs of maintaining it for smaller or larger audiences, and stair steps for adding additional viewing rooms for a single show.  He can calculate that supply curve based on costs and profit margins.  Sussing out the demand curve on any given night takes some guesswork and price titration.  Once you find the market-clearing price, you can drop all the discounts and coupons and market research and make that the one price for everyone, and occasionally wobble the price a bit to see if tastes have changed any.<p>That is <i>not</i> what Amazon is doing.  They are segmenting the market, not trying to clear it.",1415287651

8567356,comment,8566436,8566865,0,0,tomp,,,"Hm... again, I think we disagree fundamentally about why taxes are the way they are. Let me explain the way I see it.<p>A government, its taxes and the public services it offers (firefighters, courts&police, mandatory vaccination, schooling, etc) are a great solution to a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma that people face: &quot;Why should I contribute for the fire department, when my neighbors will?&quot; Then, a house somewhere caches fire and the whole city burns down, because no one was willing to pay for a single fire truck.<p>Then, the question is not, &quot;how much does a single person benefit from a specific service&quot;, but more &quot;how much does the society benefit&quot; - <i>everybody</i> benefits <i>a lot</i> - less revolutions, less famine, less epidemic illnesses, less crime. How should we finance this? The answer almost all countries converge to is <i>progressive taxation</i>; it makes sense, really, as those who have the most also have the most to loose. What should we tax? Most countries tax income, sales (VAT), and profits/dividends; also specific goods (e.g. tobacco), capital gains/interest, and property. Most of these are IMO good - sales tax is very progressive (those who have more -> consume more -> pay more tax), tobacco tax discourages smoking (a lot of external costs, especially in countries with public health system), property tax promotes effective use of land and is progressive as well, as are capital gains/interests taxes. Personally, I would reduce income tax, and raise profits/dividend tax (as those who work tend to be poor, those who own tend to be rich), but that&#x27;s just me.<p>AFAIK, taxes don&#x27;t work the way you think they do - sales tax is really VAT, so you don&#x27;t pay 20% (you only pay 20% of the added value you create, which for most businesses is a much lower percentage of revenue) - also, income tax is applied before tax on profits (employee salary is a cost to the business), and for most people it&#x27;s quite a bit lower than 30% (i.e. for the poor, those who spend most of their paychecks on basic goods). Tax on profits is in many jurisdictions completely optional - the owners could very easily elect to pay no tax on profits (only tax on dividends, which is in line with income tax), but then they would have unlimited liability. Tax on profits is basically the price of buying limited liability.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there should be no double tax treaties - there should be, of course, but companies should not be able pay less tax on the profits generated within one country, just because taxes in the other country are lower.",1415287251

Python also automatically binds the object instance to the first (self) parameter.<p>What you&#x27;re describing does not bear much resemblance to Python.",1415286539

Those are the people to lobby, those are the people to buy, but they are hidden from the rest of the population.  The only way to keep them honest would be to make every bit of information they give to the lawmakers public and freely available, so we can be sure the lawmakers aren&#x27;t being manipulated.

If they don&#x27;t at all, it will be impossible to make them improve. If they care a lot, they will improve themselves. If they care a little, that&#x27;s where you can try some of the strategies others have given here.<p>As for my specific suggestions, I would recommend &quot;The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master&quot;, and actually apply the principles in the book yourself. Use unit tests, setup CI (such as Jenkins), a code review system (such as Gerrit), a bug tracker, code analysis (such as Sonar), and use tools (linters, etc). Also, cranking up warnings on your compilers/interpreters and not allowing in anything that doesn&#x27;t pass muster is a good start. This might all seem like a lot, but you can do little parts of it at a time. It is worrisome that you say you can&#x27;t review every commit. Perhaps you could assign members of your team to review each other&#x27;s commits?

It is not that clear cut - privacy is not binary.<p>The recent controversy over the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; is a good illustration: The &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; is not something that is explicitly part of law, but the result of an interpretation of EU privacy rights and the interplay with freedom of expression. The outcome of which was a judgement to allow people to <i>reduce the level of exposure</i> of information even when that information was already out there, and despite deciding that removing the information from the source in that case was going too far.<p>Secondly, copyright is by no means the only law that governs your ability to publish something, and in Europe &quot;any reasonable person&quot; ought to at least consider that depending on their specific country and specific circumstances they may run afoul of one or more other laws if they republish without checking with the photographer and subjects in the case of photographs that includes people.<p>The license only governs the rights to reproduce the image, but depending on other laws and situations, privacy rights, moral rights (droit d&#x27;auteur/authors rights) and portrait rights may all come into play (moral rights belong to the author (photographer); portrait rights lie with the subject - both are usually non-transferrable in the countries that recognise them; basic moral rights are explicitly recognised by the Berne convention).",1415286144

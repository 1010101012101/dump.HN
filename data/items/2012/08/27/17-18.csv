4439944,comment,4434509,4434509,1,0,gwern,,,"> Despite the vast attention paid to the astronauts psychological profiles and their ability to work in teams, the Apollo 11 crew verged on the dysfunctional. While Armstrong and Aldrin didnt quite match Stoppards Scott and Oates, there was a fierce behind-the-scenes battle between them to be first to set foot on the Moon. Early plans were for Aldrin, as module pilot, to step out first, but one version reported by Smith has it that Armstrong, as mission commander, lobbied more vigorously than Aldrin, and Nasa backed him up because he would be better equipped to handle the clamour when he got back and, more mundanely, because his seat in the lunar module was closer to the door. Aldrin paid Armstrong back by taking no photographs of him on the Moon: the only manually taken lunar image of the First Man on the Moon is in one of many pictures Armstrong snapped of Aldrin, showing himself reflected in the visor of Aldrins spacesuit. Asked about this omission later, Aldrin lamely replied: My fault, perhaps, but we had never simulated this in training. Later, Aldrin put it about that Armstrongs First Sentence might have been a bureaucratic concoction.<p><a href=""http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n17/steven-shapin/what-did-you-expect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v27/n17/steven-shapin/what-did-you-expe...</a>",1346090186

Our appraiser certainly didn't want to boot up the laptop and examine its contents for valuable files. The only times I've turned on that laptop in the past year have been to look for clues about financial documents, look for pictures to use at her funeral, and to make sure I had a backup of her phd thesis.<p>Personally, I'm thankful that digital assets are non-transferrable because in my case, no one would have wanted them, and it allows me to feel no guilt about not putting them on an estate tax return.<p>Also, digital media are not the only non-transferrable assets that can potentially belong to an estate. Season tickets to sporting events and vehicle registrations come to mind, but I'm sure there are others.<p>I guess the question comes down to: if Apple allowed you to buy transferable licenses to music in the iTunes store at $1.50/song and non-transferable licenses at $1.00/song, which would you buy? I suspect the overwhelming majority of Americans would choose the $1.00 non-transferable license. Also, I suspect estate planning would almost never enter into that decision making process.<p>Thankfully, at least with iTunes music, this is not an issue of DRM. If there had been any music on my mom's laptop that I wanted, it would have been easy to transfer it.",1346090179

Which extends to it being also a common API for extensions to your classes (I'm playing with a Perl/Glib project using the Moose MOP framework to allow Perl classes to have Glib signals, for example). Speaking for Perl/Moose, it's regularly used to modify or extend the behavior/capabilities of attributes (by applying traits to them).<p>Even just the introspective aspect means your program can easily know about the structure of your classes, for serializations, debugging, proxying, auto-generating documentation, auto-generating command line arguments, and so on.<p>This is just a rough outline, and in no way complete.

What's the problem?<p>I say this as a barefoot runner.  I've stopped caring about ""running naturally"" or similar nonsense.  If you look at the research, things that correlate with injury are mostly doing ""too much, too soon"".  There are a couple other things, but from this I conclude that if you do something gradually (like build from 5k to a marathon over some years), then you are minimizing your risk of injury.  But if you do something non-gradually such as couch to 10K, or 10K with form A to 10K with form B, you are increasing your risk of injury.<p>Certain types of shoes that may or may not prod you into some ""more correct"" form do not correlate with lower injury rates.  I don't think much research has been done on bare feet, but reading barefoot runners' forums leads me to believe injury rates are at least in the same ballpark as any other group of runners.",1346089478

Even if you, as a publisher, pay Apple/Amazon 30% you're better off than retail and retail typically has a higher markup, means printing books, storing them in warehouses, shipping them across the country/world, etc.<p>On top of this ebooks are basically nontransferable whereas paper books can of course been sold secondhand. The latter is such a ""problem"" that the textbook industry, as just one example, will keep changing editions each year or two just to kill the secondhand market.<p>It should come as no surprise that ebooks are nontransferable either.<p>Given all these restrictions and lower costs of production it seems logical that ebooks should be cheaper than their dead tree equivalents. But oh no, they're typically the same price or even more expensive. This is nothing but greed. What's more, publishers are shooting themselves in the foot (long term) here because they should be encouraging a system whereby you can buy a given textbook, it can't be sold secondhand and the original owner keeps getting updates (people don't typically rebuy later editions of the same textbook I would guess).<p>Music isn't really that different. CDs, which are transferable, have the same costs of printing, storage, distribution and retail markup, even against the 30% (is this confirmed for music?) margin Apple/Amazon take yet I don't think you'll be saving any money by buying whole MP3 albums vs CDs (more often than not).<p>If electronic media were cheaper <i>like it should be</i> I think consumers would have an easier time accepting the nontransferability aspect.

That list price is typically about eight times the cost of manufacturing. In clothing retail terms, that translates into a markup of about 88% between publisher and reader.</i><p><i>There are several reasons for the big percentage. Not only does the actual bookseller require a markup, but often there are two middlemen between the publisher and the bookstore: a distributor and a wholesaler who must each get a piece of the action. And of course the publisher wants to make a profit and better not sell merely for the cost of manufacturing.</i><p>which basically confirms the 12% figure.

By the time I was two weeks into the second project, I knew I was wasting a lot of time because I kept doing similar tests in the console when writing or modifying new code. But by that point I already felt like I had too much uncovered code to start writing tests. Cause if someone looked at it and saw just one test, what would they think ? (I know, right?)<p>The real reason is some kind of fear, that I do not exactly understand. Luckily, these were very small projects and never became anything I had to actually support or the tragedy would have been a lot more substantial - as it is my main loss was my own education.<p>My third rails project I forced myself to write specs and NEVER use the console for anything that slightly resembles testing - even if its just ""trying things out"". I put it all in tests and code and spent the effort to get my testing setup really fast and slick.<p>I've written dozens of tests now and still have a lot to learn but I'm definitely seeing a lot ofvalue. Hopefully it is not just cognitive dissonance. I've spent way more time on tests than on the actual code. I expect though that part will get better. I've been programming for sixteen years, but only testing for a few months.<p>One thing that really helped me is having some examples - the first I looked at were the tests that come with Devise, the other was the specs in Diaspora (<a href=""http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora</a>) .

It was devised as a way to teach children that evolution is, if not false, at least not well accepted and not as ironclad as biologists claim.<p>Everything you just stated about AGW falls into the same category, and is cherry-picked &quot;evidence&quot; intended to dispute that AGW is a fact, which for all intents and purposes it is.  Neither you nor I have the ability to judge to what degree this or that deviation from predictions affects the theory as a whole.  You know who does?  Climate scientists.  You know what they&#x27;ve concluded?

In both cases, there are well-supported and widely accepted theories that particular groups of people don&#x27;t want to believe for ideological reasons.  In both cases, the drive to defend ideology takes the form of an attempt to piece together enough seemingly rational pieces of disjointed evidence to discredit the theory that threatens that ideology.  And, in both cases, the attempt to deny the theory is refuted and dismissed by those best equipped to judge it.<p>You can claim to be a skeptic, just as the person who claims there are holes in evolution that can only be explained by an intelligent designer claims to be a skeptic, but you&#x27;re not.  A skeptic is not someone who disbelieves or discredits, but rather is someone who reserves judgement and attempts to find counterarguments <i>until the preponderance of evidence</i> suggests that a claim is valid.

The decades of work before it make it amply clear it was not obvious [1].<p>Oddly enough, your own paper describes quite a few features of that Wright patent not immediately apparent, but it doesn&#x27;t matter, as you&#x27;ve missed one point about the standard I articulated.  If you recall, my standard was for people who had <i>not seen</i> it to be able to make it simply by being told what it <i>does</i>.  If anything, the history of flying would support the notion that &quot;make a thing that flies&quot; was non-trivial at the time.<p>> But the mathematics that goes into proving that they actually work and work well span pages.<p>Math is not patentable subject matter... unless you disguise it as software :)  And standard that excluded silly UI patents that lead to billion dollar lawsuits (modulo various jury errors, like charging them for things not found infringing and other court adjustments)?  Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m thinking &quot;feature&quot; when you&#x27;re thinking &quot;bug&quot;.<p>> It showed that while the total rate of innovation didn&#x27;t change much across countries, in countries with patents, significant innovation was diversified into areas that were elsewhere under-developed because they were easy to copy.<p>&quot;Innovation&quot; is an inherently nebulous thing to measure.  Also, if the only patents are the things the public can&#x27;t easily figure out, then they would actually do the job they&#x27;re supposed to--advancing science and the useful arts.  I don&#x27;t like software patents at all, though, and if we did have them they should require source code.

What they need is access to the nutrients calculation logic (which is the actual product you sell).<p>Or you could do like it is done with barcodes, and charge a low fee per label generated.

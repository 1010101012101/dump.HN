Free electronic books thus have a significant advantage in the ability to effectively evaluate quality before making a substantial commitment of money or time.",1432850391

9621442,comment,9620783,9621078,0,0,nepstein,,,"I can definitely understand wanting to classify Pavlov as supervised learning. I think it&#x27;s a murky issue because supervised and reinforcement are very closely related (and it is frequently possible to reframe problems of one type as problems of the other depending on what type of model one uses).<p>My two main reasons for going with this name are as follows (if people see issues in my logic, I&#x27;m happy to be convinced):<p>1) Reinforcement learning gets its name from the behaviorist psychology concept of reinforcement in which an agent&#x27;s actions are met with rewards in order to shape that agent&#x27;s future behavior. This is precisely the kind of response conditioning that Pavlov is well known for.<p>2) The key difference is what the training data look like.<p>In a supervised learning problem, the training data are input/output pairs (a stimulus and an appropriate action).<p>In reinforcement learning, the training data are input and reward pairs (an action and the reward applied to that action).<p>I would argue that Pavlov&#x27;s experiments more like the latter case - the dogs are not shown &#x27;this is the correct action for this stimulus&#x27;, they are shown &#x27;this is the reward for this stimulus&#x27;.",1432850184

A user is not reacting every time their character is hit. They may have an initial reaction to a surprise attack that catches them off guard, but no more. There is some level of immersion but there is no level of presence. They never feel like they might be in danger and their body does not react as if it is in any danger.<p>Presence would be having a <i>feeling of discomfort</i> anytime your avatar was injured. The brain having tricked itself into thinking <i>it is the avatar</i>. When the avatar gets hit by a weapon, the user&#x27;s body sweats and tenses up, believing it was just hit by an actual weapon.<p>Air-pressured tactile gloves can help develop a sense of presence. For example, pressure when grabbing a rock may trick your brain into believing the rock is real.<p>I wanted to focus more on the studies than the .gif.

Which is what Sanders does.<p>This is even more effective when conservatives - who definitely draw from a similar age group if Fox&#x27;s demographics are any indication - harken back to the 1950s as some sort of golden era.<p>If instead you want to turn his positive into a negative, you take out the <i>reason</i> why he uses that strategy and just focus on the <i>old</i> part of the message.<p>His message resonates with me. I am not in his age group. You&#x27;ll note too that the article didn&#x27;t say if the message also resonates with Baby Boomers, Gen X, Gen Y/Millennials, or any other age group. (He was born in 1941, so he&#x27;s not a Baby Boomer.)<p>But by only focusing on the people his age or older, it come across as not resonating with a younger age group. (In first order predicate logic, this would be an obviously false inference. But I suspect most people will use an argument from silence, despite the difficulties of that argument.)",1432849810

It is fairly intuitive for them that provided they can draw a right triangle, they just need to measure the sides. And it is easy to accept that someone computed sines and cosines for a lot of angles and put it in a table.
My point being, that we didn&#x27;t need (in the past) calculus to compute trigonometric functions, and I don&#x27;t see how it is a burden for students to be introduced to those functions without the Calculus definition.<p>And the reality is, that the definition of sine as a ratio of the catheti and hypotenuse is a rigorous definition of the function. Strictly, this sine is different from the sine of calculus. The first, the sine from Euclidean geometry, assigns a real to pair of rays, while the calculus sine, is function from the real numbers to the reals.

No serious formal study here, but a few classes and a lot of reading of Hindu texts under my belt:<p>The human &quot;Self&quot; -- capital S -- generally refers to Atman. Atman is a &quot;shard&quot; of Brahman. So Self does denote Brahman, but with the tacit understanding that Atman is itself composed of Brahman, like a small patch of a flowing stream. It&#x27;s not its own separate entity, but rather a piece of the whole that is also representative of the whole (look up &quot;Tat Tvam Asi&quot; for more on this concept).<p>The self -- lowercase s -- is generally used to refer to the dual self that humans have: Atman and Jiva. The Atman is the Self as we discussed before (but the Self is also the divine, as Krishna claims throughout the Gita). The Jiva, however, is the discrete part of the self -- the ego, all wants/desires, attachments to sense-objects and the physical world.

Syntactically speaking, languages generally have become more complex over time.<p>When it comes to sound change (phonology) though, things are getting simpler. This is due to external (language interaction) and internal change. Internally, we tend to ease articulation over time, we tend to evolve words to increase perceptual clarity and we tend to introduce sound systems with symmetry. By symmetry I mean, for example, sounds which activate your larynx (AKA &quot;voiced&quot; as in &quot;b&quot; in &quot;boy&quot;) naturally create room for an unvoiced pairing like &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pair&quot;. Or a vowel sound from the lower back of your mouth like &quot;a&quot; in &quot;father&quot; will incentivize a lower front sound like &quot;a&quot; in &quot;sat&quot;. A high back sound like &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;pool&quot; will lead the way for use of a high front sound like &quot;ea&quot; in &quot;seat&quot;.<p>Lots of internal as well as external processes at play which tend to evolve things towards a more efficient and simple phonological system.<p>On a more complicated level we have the interaction between morphological (word formation) and syntactic (word arrangement) components. According to my notes the motivating force behind morphological change (and to a lesser extent, syntactic change) is analogy. Not analogy as in the common definition; but analogy as in the process in which one form becomes like another form with which it&#x27;s associated.  For example, &quot;kine&quot; has been replaced by &quot;cows&quot; so that it better conforms to expected pluralization practices. Think of the mistakes children make saying things like &quot;foots&quot; and consider this an untainted window into our brain&#x27;s natural grammar system. Analogy here serves to remove irregularities and this might be what has you thinking things are getting less complex.<p>You also might be interested in the evolution of English from a more inflection based language to a more analytic one. Inflection languages create grammatical distinctions with morphological affixes. Like prefixes or suffixes, they are attached to words for things like tense. An analytic language like Modern English has lost a lot of it&#x27;s inflection and uses word order and function words (prepositions, articles, conjunctions) to indicate grammatical relationships.<p>I&#x27;ve got a 70% right now and the guy beside me has a 95%... so that&#x27;s the best I can do in this moment.

Infections are now routinely cured with antibiotics. Vaccines prevent deadly disease. Hygiene and health and safety standards across the board reduce death from other causes dramatically - there has been an increase in laws regarding health and safety in every facet of life.<p>People are living longer. The older you are the more likely you are to have cancer. It is hypothesized that given enough time everyone develops some kind of cancer even if microscopic (more on that later)<p>Automobile fatalities (the thing most likely to kill young adults) are down dramatically. This is due to safer cars and a decrease of things like DUIs due to public awareness and a huge increase in prosecution. My grandpa told me in the 70s police would routinely pull him over, see he was drunk, and tell him just to go home. New safety features are required almost every year on automobiles. People take infant car seats very seriously nowadays. When I was a kid as soon as I could sit upright by myself I was out of the car seat.<p>2)There&#x27;s not a lot we don&#x27;t know about cancer still. We know that it is a combination of genes and environment that cause it and there are things you can do to lessen your likelihood of getting it such as not smoking... but overall we haven&#x27;t done a whole lot to prevent most types of cancer and still have a lot to go in completely understanding it. Which specific genes and which specific environmental factors are still somewhat of a mystery, I mean we know some stuff but still not enough.  Some types like cervical cancer are largely (but not completely) preventable with routine pap tests but that&#x27;s the exception.<p>3) Increased screening leads to an increase in detection of benign and asymptomatic cancer. This turns people into cancer patients who wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise been cancer patients without screening. This is kinda a new thing. We used to believe that cancer runs one course - that it started at stage 1 and grew continuously until it spread all over your body and killed you - so catching cancer while it is small and treatable will prevent it from spreading and becoming deadly. We are learning from experience that isn&#x27;t <i>always</i> the case, some can develop so slowly that there&#x27;s no way it will cause problems in your lifetime. Take prostate cancer for example - the PSA test is a blood test that was developed to detect asymptomatic prostate cancer. The PSA test is no longer recommended because it lead to an increase in cancer diagnoses but a very modest corresponding decrease in cancer related deaths. That tells us that <i>some</i> men who would be diagnosed with prostate cancer if they had the PSA test wouldn&#x27;t ever be diagnosed without it. Routine mammograms have detected thousands more very early stage cancer (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ) than ever before. The numbers tell us some of these new diagnoses wouldn&#x27;t have progressed (and maybe would have regressed). Everything requires treatment though because we don&#x27;t know which small tumor will become deadly and which one won&#x27;t. More info on this is here:

But some are more like birds—the most aggressive cancers have already taken flight before you can discover them, which is why some people still die from cancer, despite early detection. And lots are more like turtles. They aren’t going anywhere. Removing them won’t make any difference.<p>>Over the past two decades, we’ve tripled the number of thyroid cancers we detect and remove in the United States, but we haven’t reduced the death rate at all. In South Korea, widespread ultrasound screening has led to a fifteen-fold increase in detection of small thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancer is now the No. 1 cancer diagnosed and treated in that country. But, as Welch points out, the death rate hasn’t dropped one iota there, either. (Meanwhile, the number of people with permanent complications from thyroid surgery has skyrocketed.) It’s all over-diagnosis. We’re just catching turtles.<p>The other thing is you may just be hearing about it more or it might just be talked about more than it used to be.",1432847935

If you cannot remain calm and professional in the face of insults, you are not well suited for police work.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales</a>",1432846835

On desktop we end up with huge flat areas or chunky images stretched beyond their size.<p>Massive scaled chunks. Even on mobile it&#x27;s just a stack of coloured boxes.<p>I like some aspects of material design like the paper philosophy, the fine shadows, buttons, and other things that do well on mobile. But more work is needed to improve the desktop interface.<p>Remember seeing iPhone apps scaled up to iPad screen size? That&#x27;s how a lot of websites look now on desktop screens.",1432846829

They make it easy to optimize profit margin in the short term, and dismiss long-term, difficult to quantify investments. The short term numbers are nice and solid, and the long term risk and investment are fuzzy.<p>In the near past, this focus improved the economy, but now I think we&#x27;re in a stage of overoptimization of short term profits over real value. You can see where real GDP is now beginning to tail off in the charts - it happens later than the salary drop but it&#x27;s there. Company lifetimes are getting shorter (showing misallocation of risk & R&D, and less buffer to weather mistakes & downturns), general numbers of new business starts are lower (suspect this is a side effect of less time & salary for workers).<p>Worker salaries are hit as a big side effect too.. how you do quantify long term value of a worker - it&#x27;s easier to quantify short term worker outputs as shallow primary effects and ignore the longer term secondary effects of retention and experience. Now compare fuzzy secondary effects against the calculation of short term profit projections. You can see how jobs are easily slashed, or moved overseas... even if three to five years down the line you lose some efficiency (it&#x27;s not quantified so it doesn&#x27;t exist in a cost-benefit trade off).",1432846818

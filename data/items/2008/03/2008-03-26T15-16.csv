I'm an INTJ myself and have the understanding that it's a fairly rare personality type. (For my part, the Objectivist viewpoint does have some appeal, but also deep flaws which keep me from embracing it.)<p>Anyway, I think that it's inevitable that the YC society will take on a life of its own which is oriented with pg's viewpoints. His writings are very charismatic and draw like-minded individuals. Those founders who resonate strongly with the essays and concepts of pg are even more likely to apply for and be accepted to YC.<p>Fortunately some of the mentioned aspects of the YC culture are independent thinking, self-analysis and critical analysis of others' ideas. Hopefully these attributes will prevent a simple cult of personality from developing. If YC has positive benefits for both the founders and the greater society (via the creation of Things People Want) then inculcating a culture which can accelerate the development of successful startups is an excellent achievement.",1206546889

Even when I work with mathematica, I often union two lists to remove duplicate entries, because mathematica makes sure to remove duplicate entries.<p>The no-duplicates would seem to be a very important thing about union, and when they are removed or not.  Union is just the complement of intersect, which would be the empty set for (a a) int. (b).

Take this all with a grain of salt, though, because it's been a while since I was taught set-theory, but here's my stab at it:<p>there is an intersection between '(a a) and '(a b); the element 'a.  Thus, the union would be the set of things inside the intersection --- 'a --- and the parts outside it --- 'b.<p>With the second union, there is no intersection, so the union is merely the set of things not in the intersection, which is the original sets, resulting in '(a a b).  There is no relation defined in the union operation between those things not in the intersection, so they remain in the union set.",1206544131

473358,comment,473350,473350,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think it would depend greatly on the kind of service you are going to offer.<p>If you mean 'trust' to stand for 'comercially trust' then I think the answer is no, simply because it is different. We started out as a .nl but within days it was clear that if we were to have any sales at all it had better be a .com, or people simply aren't going to pull their credit cards.<p>If you mean 'trust' to stand for 'are they going to put their data in to your site' then I think that that effect will be a lot less, and once you've built up a user base it will fade. del.icio.us is a nice example (even if it does still have the .us in there, and they eventually changed over to delicious.com).<p>Personally, for any commercial website I'd use nothing but a .com, unless it was targeted to a specific geographic location, then I'd use the domain for that country instead.",1234183063

473354,comment,473266,473325,0,0,time_management,,,"It's certainly possible for a housewife/husband to keep intellectually and socially active, but in practice, it seems to be fairly rare, especially considering the low incomes that single-earner couples tend to have, and the constraints that this lack of means will place on social functionality. When there's a single earner making a lot of money, then income's not a problem, but the working partner tends to be in a ""martyr your family"" job, so the non-working partner tends to become a supporting actor in the other's career.<p>There's a reason people of both genders are very averse to this lifestyle. It's possible to be a housewife or househusband and not rot away, but it's difficult and fairly uncommon in practice.<p>I don't think that being a subservient housewife is more damaging than the median, braindead cubicle job. They're both pretty awful options, and the subordination that follows from either situation is going to lead to lethargy and atrophy. But most of us are going to be marrying people with better career options than the uninspiring, dead-end cube job.",1234182784

473349,comment,473266,473266,0,0,time_management,,,"Most men who marry subservient housewives are unhappy and gradually lose interest in their marriage partners as social and intellectual atrophy set in. On the other hand, anyone who marries a ""career"" person in the traditional corporate sense is signing up for misery.<p>Ascendancy in a corporate management hierarchy requires a martyred family. You're expected to spend long days at the office, attend and throw parties where no one has a good time, neglect your children, and relinquish all control over where you live, moving across the country if the  company asks for it. No man with enough means to be self-sufficient wants to marry this type of ""career woman"". On the other hand, I can't imagine that a woman who has other options would marry this type of man either. This is why ""alpha"" investment bankers tend to marry women significantly below them in education and intelligence.<p>Also, what I said about social and intellectual atrophy for subservient housewives also applies equally to those who are trying to climb corporate ladders, as their social and intellectual lives end up being restricted entirely to their work. Subordinate status-- whether one is a corporate VP or a subservient housewife/househusband-- rots the brain.<p>Best is to marry a woman who has a creative, independent and satisfying career that allows her to work anywhere in the country, and that pays her enough that she is self-sufficient.",1234182231

Otherwise, you copy and paste for 5 minutes, because that's quicker (or at least you think it's quicker, which is even worse).<p>Same with programming - if you are a good programmer, it's quicker for you to invent and refactor then to copy and paste, so you do that.

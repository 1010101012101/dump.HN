We are nowhere near the upper-bound of that scale. To quote from Bostrom&#x27;s <i>Superintelligence</i>:<p>> Far from being the smartest possible biological species, we are probably better thought of as the stupidest possible biological species capable of starting a technological civilization—a niche we filled because we got there first, not because we are in any sense optimally adapted to it.<p>I think this whole discussion could be elevated significantly if people would try to really understand the arguments put forth by people like Nick Bostrom. So many of the objections either misconstrue Bostrom&#x27;s arguments or don&#x27;t realize that he&#x27;s written reams in response. I recommend taking the time to read <i>Superintelligence</i>, or at least watch Bostrom&#x27;s talk at Google[2].

No more two-way data binding and going crazy with ngModel, scope oddities are gone, etc. Scope is replaced by component instance data, and controllers by component constructors and methods, just like it should be! Building components is a <i>lot</i> easier than directives, and they can be extended and composed in a more OO fashion. It&#x27;s way more accessible and easier to learn than v1 was.<p>Also, it&#x27;s actually a lot closer to being ready than people think. We&#x27;ve had relatively few roadblocks despite the alpha status. It tries to do less than v1 did, which we appreciate as a framework extension.<p>So, obviously we are heavily invested in Angular, but we also see the v1 design issues firsthand and are the first to admit Angular can, and should, be better (though people are building amazing applications with it today). I&#x27;m convinced v2 is going to be great for the project and switching costs won&#x27;t be as terrible as previously predicted.<p>Plus, it&#x27;s going to make v2 of Ionic a lot faster and better, so I&#x27;m all for it.<p>(also, we are starting a series of posts on how Angular 2 works, if you&#x27;re interested: <a href=""http://blog.ionic.io/angular-2-series-introduction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ionic.io/angular-2-series-introduction/</a>)",1428274688

I see this as the same dilemma with nuclear power. We know that fusion is better than fission for us in the long run, althought it is orders of magnitude more difficult to get...

The agent is capable of extreme self improvement on exceedingly short timescales (minutes to days).<p>This really depends what you mean by &quot;self-improvement&quot;.  It will probably be easy for an agent to &quot;self-improve&quot; in the sense of just optimizing its code to run more efficiently, in terms of space and time, thus giving it more time and space to think and allowing it to converge towards calculative rationality more quickly.  It will probably be very hard (proving you&#x27;ve got the optimal compression/generalization algorithm is incomputable) for an agent to &quot;self-improve&quot; in the sense of improving its compression/learning algorithms to learn more from the same quantity of sensory data.<p>>2.

9325503,comment,9325068,9325068,0,0,saticmotion,,,"Here are some personal thoughts in no particular order:<p>- Most people are bound to be about average, that&#x27;s how averages work. In life you&#x27;ve probably been through a couple of &quot;selection procedures&quot; (for lack of a better term) that redefine this average for you personally. Very early in life, the average is low. People with an intellectual disability get &quot;filtered out&quot; and end up in special care, and the average rises. After primary school (and I&#x27;m basing myself off of the Belgian school system, which I&#x27;m most familiar with), you start specialising. Some people choose a very hands on education (woodworking, mechanic, etc.) which doesn&#x27;t require the same intellectual capabilities as, what we call, general education (lots of science, Latin, Greek, etc.). The average changes. Then you might go to higher education and choose between high school or university. The average changes. I hope you get the point by now: depending on how good (and I&#x27;ve focused purely on intellectual capability, you might focus on another quality) you are, you will find a very high or very low average. Whatever path people choose, they are bound to be around the about average in their path.<p>- Something that fits quite well with the previous point, is how high you&#x27;ve set your personal standard. I&#x27;m not here to tell you whether or not your standard is too high or too low, you have to decide that for yourself. But consider that someone aiming to be a top theoretical physicist is going to have a much harder time achieving his standard than someone aiming to have a family, dog and house, without struggling financially. This person is again going to have a much harder time achieving their standard, compared to someone living in a poor village in Africa, just wanting to not be starving. (And you might argue that person in Africa will have a much harder time not starving than an average male white American getting a house with a family and a dog, but that&#x27;s besides the point)<p>- Keep this standard higher than your current personal level. It will keep you wanting to become better at whatever you&#x27;re doing. But keep it realistic, that will prevent you from becoming hopeless about never reaching a certain standard.<p>- Just because people tell you you should be happy for not being that starving person in Africa, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re right. They&#x27;re not entirely wrong either; there are people who have it a lot worse than you&#x27;ll ever have. But someone else&#x27;s struggles and troubles do not negate your own.<p>- There&#x27;s also something that&#x27;s known as selection bias[0]. This fits quite nicely with point one and two. Because of the standard you&#x27;ve chosen for yourself or the average you&#x27;ve ended up comparing against, you will have a tendency to see all the people doing better than you, and ignoring those doing worse than you. Again, this doesn&#x27;t mean your struggle is irrelevant. It&#x27;s just something to keep in mind when comparing yourself against others.<p>- But then again, is there any point in comparing yourself against others? A nihilist[1] might say it doesn&#x27;t matter what you do in your life. That there is no inherent value to anything you do or achieve. That there is no particular meaning to life. Maybe you can find yourself in this reasoning?<p>- Think about relocating. Paying those college fees might not have been hard in Belgium. Up until this academic year, higher education cost about 650-700 Euro per year. Even less if your household earns less than a certain amount. Fees as low as 150 Euro are possible for a year of higher education.<p>- A silly example from my own life, incorporating some points I previously made: Take a look at my English. I wasn&#x27;t born in an English-speaking country, never lived in one either. I think there is still a lot to be improved about my English. But compare my English to what you might see in the comments on certain websites. Is my English really that bad (especially when keeping in mind it&#x27;s not my mother tongue). Then compare my English to what you might see in a work of Shakespeare. Is it even worth learning more if I&#x27;ll never reach that level of English? But in the end: does it even matter how good my English is, as long as I can get my point across?<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism</a>",1428271855

I don&#x27;t even walk into the room for a candidate&#x27;s in-person interview with a set of questions - I use cues in our conversation to get details that shapes what technical questions I ask. While I need to efficiently get a certain set of information about candidates, I also am respectful of their time and that they have options - I take a more humanistic approach to the interview process with candidates, which helps ease people in. I will tell candidates straight up that I don&#x27;t care about perfection for [insert technical question], but that I want candidates to step through a problem and figure out a solid way to solve it (potentially with help), then retroactively optimize if they get hung up with trying to get the best solution off the bat due to typical interview pressures. In a way, solving the technical questions themselves are not the important part when I ask them (mostly) - it is the ability to walk through the problem and collaborate that I care about.<p>Easing in the candidate is important to me when I interview - I want the candidate to feel comfortable with the team, and be more willing to volunteer important information for our evaluation.

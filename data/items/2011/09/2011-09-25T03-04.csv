The problem sometimes is that the application gets so big and the solutions take too long that it becomes a grind.<p>I find that when I reach that point, it helps to take a break, look at the problem with a fresh mind, and try to break down the solution into smaller pieces.  At that level, some parts become interesting and fun again, even though others might not be.  At least you have fun in some of the parts, instead of feeling the grind of the entire thing.",1316923011

A commission would be if the same thing happened and the restaurant forwarded x% of the sale to groupon.<p>No, they work on a commission--the product they sell is the future services/products of a company who they have agreed to sell on behalf of. It's like TicketMaster collecting money for an event and then paying the promoter in a lump sum less agreed upon commissions (and yes, TM only counts their take as revenue).<p>Groupon doesn't buy a certain amount of product, they collect revenue and then pay out based on receipts. No products are purchased, they're simply a third party affiliate that has an email list and sales force.<p>> Here's an example. You are a programmer and I send you a customer. The customer gives you $5000 worth of work. You pay me $500. So you collect the money and pay me a commission. Other way: I get the $5000 from the customer (I have the contract with them) and pay you $4500 for what you have done (and have added risk etc.)<p>That's a horrible analogy. A better one is you make an agreement with a programmer who has a software package. You will sell the software for an agreed upon price and then split the proceeds 50/50. Your revenue is whatever your cut is, you're working on commission. This is exceedingly common online for affiliate programs, the only difference is Groupon approaches the business about starting the affiliate program just for them.",1316922703

Pixels are an absolute measure in the sense that they state that I want something to be the absolute size of a single pixel but the pixel is arbitrary and now your absolute measure is relative to the actual size of the pixel. As mighty as this sounds, it actually turns out to be not all that useful in design; as screen resolutions vary so will your renderings.

Is the math supposed to be clearly explained in text or just the starting conditions from which the rest of the formulae just tell the story for you?<p>Moving on to DNS having security holes and other problems with protocols made with reference implementations -- how is this relevant? Lots of scientific papers get published that later turn out to be wrong, whole fields of study sometimes look really good and push our understanding of the world but ultimately go away as ""the wrong approach"".

Similarly there are times when a few lines of code can tell me as much as paragraphs describing them. There are times when I see an equation and get what the paper is trying to discuss.  There are also times when the text is invaluable, and without it I would be lost, no matter how good the diagram or equations or code.

3034979,comment,3034761,3034761,6,0,danilocampos,,,"> With Stuxnet as a ""blueprint"" downloadable from the Internet, he says, ""any dumb hacker"" can now figure out how to build and sell cyberweapons to any hacktivist or terrorist who wants ""to put the lights out"" in a US city or ""release a toxic gas cloud.""<p>Is this really the case? I'm nothing close to a security specialist, so maybe I'm talking out of my ass. Still, everything I read on the subject said that Stuxnet was especially impressive in that it exploited not one but <i>several</i> previously-unknown OS-level exploits, on top of the embedded systems attacks it used. With these zero-days now discovered and hopefully patched, how much more value does Stuxnet offer?<p>(Neither of these questions are rhetorical — hopeful that one of our resident experts can fill me in.)",1316921165

Fire. Aim.</i> (and repeat). It's also literally what you do to find and then correct for a mis-calibrated sight.<p>It's the notion that seeing reality helps <i>a lot</i>. Once you know what is there, you can have ideas that can help. Whereas ideas that are not based on reality are very unlikely to work.<p>minor e.g. I find that my problem solving works best once I've started trying something. With each thing I try, I notice more: similarities, patterns, gaps that could be filled, things that could be connected; and I have ideas about how other things at hand could be used to do that. These are often obvious in hindsight; but I didn't think of them at all beforehand.<p>Of course, one might not succeed anyway - the pop. stat. is 9/10 businesses fail.

It is probably mostly interesting to users of concatenative languages, or those who just want to broaden their horizons..<p>Personally, I've fallen in love with it a few years ago. Even though I don't use Factor for anything practical, the language itself (as well as Forth) has taught me a completely new way of thinking about problem solving. Something that I benefit from in other languages I use.<p>So if there is one reason you should at least check it out, it is that it will make you a better programmer.

I am thinking about the usage scenarios of this machine as an average developer and how this machine could replace my Air. Most development tasks do not require the computational power of a MacBook Air and the ARM Chromebook actually feels quite smooth. The main thing is, unlike budget netbooks, this one has an okay display resolution, a very good keyboard, better than 11"" Air battery life, less heat, flash storage (though small), and less weight and thickness. I personally did never even consider buying a netbook (Atom or otherwise). If for any reason you care about sheer performance locally on your laptop, I totally agree that this machine is not for you. This Chromebook easily has the most bang for the buck than anything I bought. If I did not have the money, I could conceivably live my entire life off of it (yes, it's that good) and a Nexus 4 (again, the best bang for the buck in smartphone area.)<p>I should point out that by no means I meant that the MacBook Air is not worth its price.

Just because people want something, it doesn't mean they are truly willing to put in the required effort to get it. As the average pain tolerance of the mass market is low, the payoff must be very high (communication with loved ones, financial well-being, major time savings) for a high pain point (cognitive load in this case) to be endured.<p>It is helpful to identify if there are multiple types of users, each with different goals and pain points. If that is the case, it is optimal to only expose users to the cognitive load necessary for the tasks they are interested in. For example, there could be anonymous browsers, participants, authors, and moderators. In that case, the cognitive load for casual browsers should be as low as possible, since they have the least benefit and buy-in. As with graceful degradation for less capable web browser software, apps should degrade gracefully for users with less capability or interest in using the additional features which require a higher cognitive load.<p>With regards to Shazam, I disagree that it would have been as successful if the interface was more complicated. Sure people would still have used it, but if it was harder to figure out or required more steps or had a 15 minute delay before it emailed you the answer, usage would have been far lower.<p>Sorry if this all sounds like a cognitive load of shit.

There were early operating systems that served as an infrastructure for user's programs, they trusted the user, etc.., as nation-states basically trust their citizens to trust the government. But then too much malicious os simply unsafe software got written (as developmen became easier; life of citizen demanded much less care for the state) and the OS began morphing into restrictive and oppressive systems like OSX and Win8. As these restrictions inflicted real inconveniences on the well-behaved individuals, and voil, the government's no longer trusted and has to be fought with.<p>AFAIK, in software world the way to deal with this situation is to build a new level of infrastructure abstraction to deal with oppressive OSes (ie webapps) and let the old system slowly die out because its services aren't really needed.<p>Wonder what will become the political analog of the Web.<p>Oh wait, the Web will itself evolve to become oppressive, no new analogs needed.<p>Hegel would be happy, now that's dialectics in action.",1366534950

8034144,comment,8031840,8033970,1,0,snitko,,,"Very good example of a difficult problem. The answer to it is not government. I always challenge myself and others with this: if you had a problem for which government seems like a very reasonable answer, can you design a better solution?<p>And indeed, you can. In this example you have to realize that what government is selling to consumers is the service of preventing eventual rise in prices after the competition is weeded out. If, as a consumer, I am worried about such predatory pricing as in your example, what is to prevent me from signing a contract with a company which specifically states &quot;you are not allowed to raise the price&quot;? Then this contract can be enforced by whichever private court and protection agency I hired (how this would work is a matter of a separate post, but I recommend reading &quot;The Machinery Of Freedom&quot; by David D. Friedman on that subject).<p>However, I don&#x27;t really think you&#x27;d need that contract. What would really happen is that many companies would have infrastructure in many places (as is the case in my country) or you would have alternative connections (as, again, is the case in my country with a 4g operator Yota). Or you would have willing rich investors if they see that opportunity exists to disrupt the market. Finally, people may move and stop using the service if they dislike it.<p>There are all sorts of opportunities. Government is just one solution with a very high cost indeed: you have many people die in bloody wars which are run for your tax money and on your behalf (as is the case with both of our countries, I suppose). And no, however you wanted it, with government you can&#x27;t have only the good things and none of the bad ones. It&#x27;s logically impossible, because for a politician the economic incentives are always in the wrong place.",1405385933

In the case of species, for example, I think there is little value in a Wikipedia stub that is just a reformatted copy of the ITIS entry (<a href=""http://www.itis.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itis.gov/</a>). If that&#x27;s what I wanted, I&#x27;d just go to ITIS. When I see a Wikipedia result in a Google search result I typically expect it to be the basic taxonomic information one would find in ITIS <i>plus</i> something more. Otherwise it feels like some of that autogenerated SEO-style spam, which Google should penalize.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t always really help in jumpstarting future improvements, if the structure doesn&#x27;t align with the granularity that makes sense for an encyclopedia article. For example if there is a genus with three species, each of which is very similar and has very little distinctive written about it, the normal organization would be to write one article on the genus, with a short discussion of each subspecies in the main article, not broken out into three separate duplicative and near-empty articles. You&#x27;d only break out into separate articles on each species if there&#x27;s enough to write about them that covering them as a group becomes unwieldy (this varies widely by species). If I were to hazard a prediction, it&#x27;s that the English Wikipedia will as a result tend towards better organized species coverage than the Swedish Wikipedia, which will never get around to reorganizing these articles.",1405385500

After I was employed for a year and 25 days the company decided to relocate and lay off some employees.  There was no equity forfeiture clause in the contract in the event of termination.  Furthermore the contract stated that in the event of a liquidity event all shares vest immediately. The company was purchased a few weeks ago.  The CEO maintains that I am not entitled to <i>any</i> shares because although the signed employment agreement was executed by both parties I didn&#x27;t relocate and and get on payroll until a few days after the employment agreement was executed.  I had code written and meetings that occurred during the time he claims I was not an employee.<p>Two things --<p>First, does the date on the employment contract mean that I was an effective employee on that date?<p>Secondly, does the fact that the 5000 shares were assigned to me with no details as to what happens upon termination mean that I still own those 5000 shares?<p>The liquidity event (acquisition) occurred and other employees were paid for their shares.  I reached out to the CEO and he stated that I owned nothing.<p>My thoughts -- I definitely am entitled to 1000 shares.  Also due to the ambiguous (non-existent) details of what happens to the 5000 shares upon termination I think I may be entitled to be paid for those as well.<p>What are HN&#x27;s thoughts on this situation?",1405383228

The bribe doesn&#x27;t get any publicity/press coverage/cause any embarrassment. Campaign donations from big corporations are &quot;business as usual&quot; and the politicians don&#x27;t look corrupt in the press - but do the same way in a public, attention-grabbing way and the guy looks bad if he accepts.<p>2. The vote you want to affect is low key and doesn&#x27;t contradict the politician&#x27;s public position on major issues. Changing a politician&#x27;s opinion on the Concrete Masonry Products Research Education and Promotion Act of 2015 would be much cheaper than changing their opinion on overturning Roe vs Wade<p>3. You want to maintain the status quo. Creating new legislation and getting it through the system is a bunch of work - compared to turning up on the vote day and saying &#x27;no&#x27;.<p>4. There are future votes and future bribes to look forward to. If I give a politician $200,000 to vote a certain way, he might take the donation then vote a different way - and if I ask him to vote that way and promise him the money afterwards, I might refuse to pay after he votes. But if there are 10 votes and I donate $20,000 before each one if he voted how I wanted in the last vote? Then neither of us can screw the other over too badly because we know we&#x27;ll be making the same deal next year.<p>5. There&#x27;s aren&#x27;t other well-funded lobbyists bidding against you. Because if there are you&#x27;ll need to get into a bidding war and they might have a lot of money to throw around. If people who vote against copyright extension get $20,000 from me but people who vote for it get $50,000 from Disney I&#x27;m going to need to up my game - and Disney probably has pretty deep pockets.<p>TLDR: I&#x27;d expect cannabis decriminalisation or copyright law reform to cost a lot more than blocking tax code simplification.<p>With that said, if someone would like to organise an attempt I certainly think it would be interesting to see if a kickstarter-like approach would work.",1440335512

Clearly, moose are a menace, and we need to dramatically invest in moose-diverting safety features on our roads!<p>Except...  moose-vehicle collisions were only 15% of all animal-vehicle collisions.  Even a cursory look at the physics of what happens in a moose-car collision explains why moose collisions are disproportionately fatal.  Look at a moose, standing next to a typical compact-to-midsize car[2].  Now look at what happens when that compact-midsize car hits a moose[3].  The animal&#x27;s legs get swept out by the hood/bumper of the vehicle, and the animal&#x27;s heavy body crashes down through the windshield and the relatively flimsy roof of the vehicle, crushing the driver.<p>A similar thing happens with semi trucks.  In many cases, the front bumper of a truck, and the rear bumper on the trailer, are higher off the ground than the hood or trunk of a car.  So if a truck is involved in a rear-end collision with a car in front, as often as not the truck goes right over the top of the car, crushing the occupants of the car underneath..  Or if the car is rear-ending the truck, the hood and engine mass goes underneath the trailer, but the windshield and roof is sheared off by the steel bumper and trailer deck, along with the upper portions of the car&#x27;s occupants.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re going to make those physics much safer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5547a3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5547a3.htm</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://boredomtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/animal-size-comparison-8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boredomtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/animal-...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://cdn.wideopenspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/last-elknor.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.wideopenspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/las...</a>",1440335123

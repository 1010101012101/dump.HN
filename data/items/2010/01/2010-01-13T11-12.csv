I found the following quote regarding HTTP vs HTTPS performance on SO:<p><i>One point that has been brought up by several others is that SSL handshaking is the major cost of HTTPS. That is correct, which is why ""typical session length"" and ""caching behavior of clients"" are important.<p>Many, very short sessions means that handshaking time will overwhelm any other performance factors. Longer sessions will mean the handshaking cost will be incurred at the start of the session, but subsequent requests will have relatively low overhead.</i><p>SO Ref: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149274/http-vs-https-performance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149274/http-vs-https-perf...</a><p>I wonder which they view as more significant, gmail latency or increased server load?",1263383898

When in reality the corporation should have packed up and went home and told Mr. Tin Pot that they will be back when he can act appropriate.<p>No matter what the motive was, I commend Google for not lobbying and wasting American tax dollars to protect their business interest in a foreign land and for realizing that if the terms are not agreeable, the proper thing to do is leave the market no try to impose you will via governmental and military influence.<p>I hope that it will sever as an example to other businesses that they can leave a market if the terms are not agreeable.

1049941,comment,1047101,1049879,0,0,Confusion,,,"I have some idea of what I am talking about, because I do work for a large online forum, where the legal department has made it very clear that we do <i>not</i> need to honour requests by users to have their accounts deleted. We keep the right to display their contributions, because they have granted the forum copyright on those contributions. Not an exclusive copyright, mind you. We only have to anonimize their accounts and contents.<p>There is an inverse to the disease described in that article: the idea that someone with a lack of expert knowledge cannot possible say things that are correct, just because you disagree with him.<p>The following:<p><i>[something] cannot override statutory rights.</i><p>is a blanket statement, to which anyone can find counterexamples. You're just not trying, because you are too focussed on your original point.<p>In general, I know jack about the practice of law and I know it. However I know about this specific instance, because lawyers told me how it works, and I actually do know a bit about theory of law. I'm trying to explain to you how this specific practical fact of law could come about, based on theory of law. Specifically, the fact that laws fall short, for instance because of ambiguity and because of conflicts with other laws. Even the basest constitutional rights give rise to such conflicts, which is why judges are needed to <i>interpret</i> laws. Quite a few laws are around, specifically to stop gaps in other laws. Example: the first sale doctrine.<p>As an example of an obvious shortcoming: you are allowed to go wherever you want in a public place. The law specifies no limitation on that. However, there certainly is one very certain limitation: you cannot occupy the exact same space someone else is already occupying and you cannot get him to move by claiming your constitutional right to occupy that bit of space. It would be silly to actually codify such limitations in the laws, because their number cannot be exhausted. However, it is a very clear limitation on one of your fundamental rights. This is not my intelligence speaking: this is my knowledge of fundamental problems in philosophical theories of law and their very practical implications.",1263383392

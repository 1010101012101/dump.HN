It deserves to make the front page.<p>This is insanely important and may be the best HN link all week. Any engineer who routinely feels frustrated when working with other people should pay attention to this.<p>I&#x27;ve done engineering and sales, which are very different skillsets. More importantly, I have been mentored by other people who are world class at these respective skills, and have been very lucky to have the opportunity to learn from them.<p>Even though not everyone should learn to code, it is valuable to be able to put on the other person&#x27;s hat.<p>Non-engineers need to respect that engineers deal with situations that don&#x27;t happen in everyday life. An engineer is frequently presented with situations that boil down to &quot;it does work&quot; or &quot;it does not work&quot;. There is no gray area, and typically the computer is not very polite in the way that it tells you that you&#x27;re wrong -- errors rarely say &quot;Hey, I hope you aren&#x27;t upset about this, but something&#x27;s not working right. Want to talk it through and find a solution?&quot; Instead, we deal with messages that have the emotional sensitivity of &quot;screw you!&quot;, or if we are <i>lucky</i>, &quot;screw you! #32&quot;<p>Being in this mindset all the time will condition you to thinking in a certain way, and that&#x27;s what is required to program. People, on the other hand, don&#x27;t work like this, and if you can see the difference and act on it, you will benefit from it.",1413485926

8466760,comment,8465956,8466567,0,0,fl0wenol,,,"Linux has always supported UDP reassembly. Quoting a manpage:\n&quot;By default, Linux UDP does path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) discovery.  This means the kernel will keep track of the MTU to a specific target IP address and return EMSGSIZE when a UDP packet write exceeds it.  When this happens, the application should decrease the packet size.  Path MTU discovery can be also turned off using the IP_MTU_DISCOVER socket option or the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc file; see ip(7) for details.  When turned off, UDP will fragment outgoing UDP packets that exceed the interface MTU.  However, disabling it is not recommended for performance and reliability reasons.&quot;<p>And they ain&#x27;t kidding, because there are plenty of layer 3 devices out there who play fast and loose with fragments of UDP packets; it used to be you could assume they&#x27;d drop anything that doesn&#x27;t have a header, so by default UDP on linux doesn&#x27;t encourage it.<p>It could be that distributions have been bundling sysctl.conf files with ip_no_pmtu_disc set to true, being that most modern layer 3 devices no longer mistreat UDP so badly; this may be what you&#x27;re experiencing in the last year.",1413485904

Yet you wouldn&#x27;t know who the hell my father was even if I told you his name. It would place him as 1 in 4 billion according to these charts... \n<a href=""http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/iqtable.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/iqtable.aspx</a><p>However, Einstein would be 1 in 11,000. If the chart is to be believed, then people with an IQ of 160 or above would be about 655,000 (according to the current world population).<p>In any case, it doesn&#x27;t matter so much anymore. My father is nearly broke, sick, and in poor health right now and lives with his parents. He was somewhat successful as a business man, but not overly so. He was well known within his community, and he certainly could do anything he wanted. He was a scuba diver, a pilot, an engineer, he speaks three languages, can play the piano and saxophone, he can program a computer and rebuild engines. Having super intelligent people will not make that much difference in the world, except in the cases where those people lead countries. Until we elect leaders who have such high intelligence, we won&#x27;t see society change much at all. Intelligence does not equal money, and it doesn&#x27;t equal power. It just means you can figure out things faster than others. With computers, an average person can solve complex mathematical problems faster than the highest IQ people could 100 years ago. IQ is far less relevant in today&#x27;s world.<p>In any case, even if these high IQ people were elected, what happens when one of them has a stroke and all of a sudden their IQ is only half what it was (500)? Should we have a vote of no confidence and shun them from society? This just ends up as eugenics all over again.

8466696,comment,8458204,8464174,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Ken made the point that Google and Apple behave the same way as Microsoft in the markets where they have monopoly-like dominance, and I agreed with him. In that instance, I am not talking about browsers. I am talking about the markets in which Google and Apple have monopoly-like power, and the ways they abuse that power. Browsers are a small part of that picture (though, it is telling that all three build browsers, despite their being numerous good browser options on the web...the browser clearly holds a power position on devices, and OS vendors are guarding that position jealously).<p>Anyway, I think what the justice department went after Microsoft for was a minor part of the wrongs Microsoft committed. Bundling the browser, and effectively prohibiting computer vendors from bundling Netscape, was a nasty trick and it killed Netscape (just as Microsoft killed Lotus, WordPerfect, and numerous others, often through backroom deals to separate those companies from their customer acquisition channels). But, my concerns are less about what happened to Netscape than about what happens to consumers and the market, when consumer choice isn&#x27;t what decides the outcome.<p>IE was a proprietary overlay on the web. It was not an HTML browser, it was a Microsoft delivery platform. Having a stranglehold on the browser locked every competing OS out of the web for a <i>decade</i>. I switched to Linux on my desktop in 1995. But, I had to keep a Windows installation around on every desktop I ever owned in order to be able to access bank and government web sites, so I could use IE to access it. <i>That&#x27;s</i> why IE was destructive, and that&#x27;s abuse of monopoly power.<p>And, that&#x27;s why Microsoft created IE: To embrace and extend the web, to use their existing monopoly in several enterprise markets to subtly take over the new market of the web and destroy the openness that allowed competitors to thrive. And, it succeeded for a long time. For <i>years</i>, we were trapped in this horrible Microsoft-owned world, where the dominant browser was incompatible with every other browser and with the standards and in ways that were intimately tied to the Windows operating system.<p>So, the courts didn&#x27;t tackle the most damaging issues, unfortunately, and it took several years for the web to recover from the damage Microsoft caused.",1413485513

He&#x27;s got connections but still middle class. A fast food worker would be lower class. A fast food worker who went to Harvard, with all those connections and hobbies, would largely be the same.

If you&#x27;re trying to explain to someone the potential of becoming a developer, and committing yourself to that learning and industry how would you position it?<p>And to be clear I don&#x27;t mean it in a marketing sense so much as I mean how would you actually reword what you just called &quot;not remotely common&quot;. I think its a totally relevant point, and while Lauren positions the ideal outcome, isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re all striving for...?<p>I think you&#x27;re absolutely right that many, maybe most, perhaps even pretty-much-all bootcamps don&#x27;t effectively teach students to problem solve, to self perpetuate learning. They don&#x27;t even talk thoroughly about the commitment to their courses, much less the commitment to becoming a developer.<p>We&#x27;re in a position where for instance, we sell the &quot;dream&quot; as you like to call, to bring as much initial interest as possible. But the commitment is definitely more than just an ideal, not something that converts a signup.<p>To be fair though, in our experience over 90% of our students do a call with us before actual enrollment in a course. That is to say a &quot;purchase&quot;, and if there is anything we&#x27;re clear about in that call its what they&#x27;re really getting into. We don&#x27;t have a sales team for that, Martin and I do the calls because we designed the courses and did the career leg work.<p>Why? Well because most students who don&#x27;t have the stamina and understanding to become a developer over time drop out of our course within the fist 3 weeks, which is terrible. Not only does that just suck, but we&#x27;re an education company, drop outs are simply the worst thing in our lives.<p>Now, could you assume I&#x27;m just trying to sell you with what I want you to hear, of course, but I want to be clear I totally agree with you.

Some of the questions are matters of preference, some are matters of fact or science.  For instance, on the topic of inequality & a wealth tax, we could have these questions:<p><pre><code>  * Is a democratic society desirable? (a matter of preference)\n  * Does inequality (in wealth) distort the democratic process? (a matter of fact)\n  * Does a wealth tax correct the inequality in a way which solves the problem? (a\n    matter of fact)\n  * Is the wealth tax the best way to solve the problem? (a matter of preference)\n</code></pre>\nFor more fun, different people could have different questions, but it still makes for plenty of hilarity when one person is arguing whether a wealth tax is effective and another is arguing whether it is desirable and another is arguing whether it is necessary, and no one understands why they aren&#x27;t making any headway.<p>Now, to tie this around to your comment, I would clarify that what I mean by &quot;a democratic society&quot; is one where every person has an equal say <i>in matters of preference</i>.  In a rational society, these are the only disagreements.  I am happy to debate whether, if climate change is happening, we should do something about it.  I have neither the desire nor the time to argue whether it is happening or whether it is man-made; these are matters of science and my preference matters not one bit.<p>The problem we have now is that both matters of fact and matters of preference are up for debate, and the extremely wealthy have a disproportionate say in both.",1413484211

Dell didn&#x27;t introduce their 2560x1600 3007WFP until January 2006.  Apple was the only player for that high resolution and that strength was reflected in the price: $3299.

Not only is the safe harbor provision a well-balanced law for all parties involved, but it&#x27;s the only thing that makes startups that host UCG legally viable. Without the DMCA, Github could not exist. They&#x27;d be personally liable for every copy of every file they distribute without a copyright holder&#x27;s permission.<p>This particular piece of the DMCA doesn&#x27;t have to eliminate all piracy online to be effective. Take the case of a feature film release -- a $XXXMM investment by the copyright holders into their product -- that could be seriously harmed to the tune of tens of millions of dollars by someone leaking a copy online a few days before ticket sales begin. The DMCA notices can disable the most visible (and most damaging) copies, expeditiously enough to save the film&#x27;s box office sales. Mitigating much of the harm is better than nothing.<p>> perhaps as a society we should ask if it makes any sense to spend tax dollars<p>This part I don&#x27;t get. The alternative to the above is an emergency court hearing for every instance of infringement, hoping to attain an emergency injunction, then get it to an ISP before too much damage is done. The safe harbor provision doesn&#x27;t (directly) cost tax payers anything. It saves us billions. Every day, hundreds or thousands of instances of copyright infringement are handled by an e-mail instead of a taxpayer-funded court hearing.<p>It sounds to me like you&#x27;re making an argument against copyright, not the DMCA. DMCA § 512 (the notice/counternotice safe harbor system) is about mitigating the legal liability created by the copyright act on service providers. In its entirety, the DMCA was the US&#x27;s implementation of the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties. It is not what created copyright protection itself.",1413483340

It circulates.  And as long as it keeps moving, there is usually enough for everybody.<p>Wealth inequality is like a small group of people continually siphoning water into bottomless private cisterns.  Eventually, the rest of the world becomes a desert.  The problem isn&#x27;t that the cisterns exist, it&#x27;s that the water flowing out is nowhere near the amount flowing in.<p>I see the problem as too much <i>lending</i> and <i>investing</i> and not enough <i>spending</i> among the wealthy.  It&#x27;s like demanding that the people whom you charge to drink your water can only piss in your toilets.  When you <i>spend</i> the money, you give up control over what happens to it next, and that is what allows the next guy to spend it freely.  When you lend or invest, that next guy still owes you.  No businesses can afford to cater to him, because the money he has isn&#x27;t really his.<p>That&#x27;s why the lavish spender is not the problem.  When he eats a $500 steak, that money goes out to support servers and busboys and chefs and butchers and cattle ranchers.  And it goes from them to television actors and book authors and electricity workers and personal trainers and dog walkers and auto mechanics.  The cash flows.  It circulates.<p>With the guy that buys a 50% stake in the restaurant with his cash, without providing any actual competitive advantage to the business, that money doesn&#x27;t actually help anyone unless the previous owner can improve the business with it.  Except now he has half as much incentive to do so.  All those people down the chain only earn money if the restaurant can sell more steaks.  If putting your name on the front door doesn&#x27;t convince more people to walk through it, buying part of the business is not benefiting anyone except the new part-owner.<p>That&#x27;s why I oppose both consumption taxes and income taxes.  Both discourage the free flow of cash through the economy.<p>A tax based on the increase in one&#x27;s personal wealth would be far more useful.  It discourages only excessive hoarding.  Philanthropy that yields control of the cash is the best, as the services and goods obtained don&#x27;t even count against your own balance sheet.<p>The big spender is actually the good guy, provided that he is still able to spend as much as he earns.  That&#x27;s the real job creator.  His willingness to <i>spend</i> money is what makes people want to sell him goods and services.  If he only invests, those businesses still need to find actual customers who are willing to spend their money.",1413482715

Surely the world understands that once something is on the internet, it&#x27;s there forever, right?  Complying with the DMCA is security theater at best, and at worst, stifling to innovation.<p>I mean, we have many laws centered around the difference between intentionally and unintentionally inflicting harm on others.  So for example if you break someone’s rib performing CPR, you’re protected as a good samaritan.  Or if you veer off the road and run someone over because you were texting, you can still be tried for manslaughter because you shouldn’t have been typing on your cell phone in the first place.  I think we can all agree that it’s good we have these types of laws and don’t just focus on premeditated crime.<p>But the DMCA tries to be a moral compass when it’s not mathematically possible to do so.  It’s a bit like setting up a booth on the Grand Canyon that charges money to take pictures.  Sure, they can bust bootleggers that set up black market booths without a license.  They can even bust scalpers selling photos.  But in the end, the Grand Canyon is still there.<p>Whether someone gets irate about piracy/copying trade secrets or not, in the end, perhaps as a society we should ask if it makes any sense to spend tax dollars trying to stop something that can’t be stopped once the cat’s out of the bag.<p>Actually, I think GitHub is in a unique position to not comply with the DMCA.  It has nothing to do with the size of GitHub, because no matter how large a private entity is, it is always subject to the laws of its government.  It has more to do with the fact that every developer in the world has either heard of GitHub or uses it every day.<p>In other words, we are the people that form what can be thought of as the technology arm of society, so by extension the technology arm of government.  That gives us a seat at the table in matters of technology, the same way that teachers unions are able to influence education or the American Medical Association can influence public health.  If we decide that the DMCA is not a good use of taxpayer money and should no longer be enforced (in fact can’t be enforced), then it’s not up to a court to decide that, since they will side with the law every time (as they should).  The law itself is what must be adjusted or repealed, by the people who have the means to do so by virtue of the role they play in society.  We have the leverage to repeal it because without our support, there is no expertise to enforce it in the first place.<p>If GitHub complies with the DMCA and we use GitHub, then we are quietly endorsing the DMCA.",1413482575

If <i>everyone</i> spent all their money for consumption, and no one invested, that would probably be a bad thing, but short of actually <i>punishing</i> investment compared to other uses of money, its hard to see how that would happen.<p>Heck, its particular hardest to see how it would happen with the <i>rich</i>, anyhow. Simple declining marginal utility means that past a certain point, the additional present consumption that people find useful drops off and the value of securing an adequate future support base by investing money now vs. consuming more now increases with increasing income. The idea that we need to tax-favor investment <i>even more</i> than we currently do by taxing only consumption (rather than taxing income, but taxing the income <i>from</i> investment favorably compared to &quot;ordinary income&quot; and particularly favorably compared to labor income) seems to be based on a conception of human behavior that has no support at all in how humans, and particularly the rich, actually use their money in the <i>status quo</i> system.",1413482541

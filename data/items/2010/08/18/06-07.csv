1613438,comment,1611007,1611801,0,0,demallien,,,"<i>if DNA can encode everything the brain does with N bits of information, then regardless of how the DNA behaves, we have at least a loose estimate of the level of complexity in the brain.</i><p>No even close.  Imagine a kilobyte filled with alternating zeros and ones.  We have two commonly used methods for describing the information content of this kilobyte.  Shannon information content is closely approximated by today's compressors - and 1k worth of alternating zeros and ones compresses to next to nothing.  Kogorov Complexity is the length of the minimum necessary program to  produce the 1k worth of zeros - again, a simple loop, incrementing a pointer then dereferencing the pointer to fill the address with alternately a zero or a one suffices - a mere handful of bytes are necessary.<p>Now imagine that the RAM chip holding the zeros and ones is hit by a bunch of cosmic rays , flipping about 10% of the bits.  Both the size of a compressed version of the new kilobyte, and the Kogorov program to generate the new sequence are both going to dramatically increase in size.<p>Now, the thing is that DNA produces a brain to a fairly homogenous pattern - it's the equivalent of my series of alternating zeros and ones, although admittedly it's a bit more complex than that - this is to be expected, there's more Shannon information in DNA for encoding a brain than there was in my simple pattern of zeros and ones.<p>The cosmic rays are the equivalent of a brain learning, encoding information by weighting connections between neurons.  This process massively increases the amount of information stored in a human brain, but this information <i>must</i> be copied if you actually want the copy to behave like the original.  I would expect this amount of information to be several orders of magnitude bigger than that found in the DNA, which is why Kurzweil's claim is just completely off the wall.",1282114568

I'm the developer and an owner of a startup but my belief in its future success is dwindling. We have only maybe been profitable one month out of the past 2 years and I don't think the next pivot will work at all.<p>I've been slacking w/ my tasks and subsequently, the other partners are not happy with the amount of time I've been putting in. My passion for this company is not what it used to be at all. You could say I'm burnt out.<p>We've signed agreements breaking the company up evenly between 4 people. This is where the whole situation gets a little bit tricky - it's still registered as a Sole Proprietorship and I believe I still own the IP.<p>For the past 2 years, I've given a lot of my time and energy and would like to get something out of it if this company makes any money in the future. I built the platform this company will grow from and I spent considerable amounts of time building the brand.<p>Having the current owners buy me out doesn't seem like it could happen. (The company is not making money, who would buy into a company that's losing money?). The option they brought up is basically a stock issuance. I would assign IP and give up my ownership stake in exchange for a certain amount of stock.<p>How would you suggest I be compensated for the work I've put in? Should I even expect anything if I leave before it's making money? Are there any negatives w/ going for a stock issuance?<p>I know I should get a lawyer to write up the final agreement and am considering it. I would just like to know the community's opinion on what I should do and then bring that to the lawyer so we can just get down to business when it's time to pay.<p>Thanks for your help and advice!",1282114174

It also allows you to develop for iPhone, and for Windows if you use Parallels or VMware. If cost (comparing with crappy Dells that come with Vista, egads) is an issue, I invite you to check your wallet for this amazing device called a credit card. It's worked wonders for me.",1211503402
197695,comment,197039,197039,0,0,kilowatt,,,"Despite some of its unpythonic style, I like wxPython, because it uses native widgets everywhere. This is a huge advantage over every other toolkit, in my opinion.<p>Right now I'm experimenting with on an alternative to wxPython called wxpy using a forked version of the SIP bindings generator, instead of SWIG, to see if I can eek out more performance and bring down the memory usage:<p><a href=""http://github.com/kevinw/wxpy/wikis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/kevinw/wxpy/wikis</a>",1211503023

This is much unlike the SF echo chamber.",1211503015
197693,comment,197504,197647,0,0,raganwald,,,"The money I make off referrals is insignificant. What I do is take it as gift certificates, which I spend on books and music.<p>I'm grateful for those, in a way that's a lot better than cash. If it were cash, I might be tempted to ask whether writing really pays. The answer is definitely it does not pay compared to just about anything. I could make more money doing menial labour building Koi ponds and have lots of fun.<p>However, the buzz of getting a book or CD is way higher than the equivalent cash value. It's very irrational: If I take two hours to write a post, and I earned $14.00 from it, I would be devastated to earn $7 an hour.<p>But if I get a copy of The Goldberg Variations that I'd never heard before from that article, and I get hours of enjoyment from it... It feels like a terrific bargain to work for two hours and then enjoy a wonderful piece of music.<p>(I am not getting into the other rewards of writing. I am strictly responding to the question about referrals.)",1211502912

Slowdowns due to lack of ram can really kill your flow.<p>I have a regular macbook, mainly because of OS X, which gives me unix tools with an OS that just works. Apple's hardware is ok, not great. I've had issues with 3 out of 3 notebooks. That said, the issues have become smaller (so Apple's QC seems to have improved).<p>If I could run OS X on cheaper hardware, I would do it in an instance. I don't need to show off at the coffee shop. :)",1211502852

197690,comment,197525,197678,0,0,xlnt,,,"Umm. It's twitter's decision. Twitter decided. This person --  who has a problem with free expression -- thinks twitter decided wrong. And then misleads about what happened -- e.g., saying twitter won't enforce ToS when actually they just don't want free speech banned on their site.",1211502730
197689,comment,197634,197634,0,0,dood,,,"There is a lot of noise around the subject, but if you boil it down I don't think it's much of mystery: Twitter represents an important new way to communicate. People like communicating. Some people also like tech/startups, so for them it's double the fun.",1211502542
197688,comment,197182,197261,0,0,mindslight,,,"I've had a T60 for about 16 months now. What exactly do you like about the keyboard? I've found that the keys have a tendency for things to get stuck in their movement, and the ] key had even fallen off of my keyboard. Then the whole keyboard stopped working, so they sent me a new one. I've also gotten a new power adapter (insufficient strain relief).<p>I personally like going with the three year warranty (but in a bundle rather than explicitly adding it on). I previously had a T22 that I ran into the ground, and over the course of its life had the motherboard, drive, and power cord replaced.",1211502483

197683,comment,197525,197525,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Poor twitter. They can't get a break. I'm surprised that most commenters on the various sites seem to automatically assume that harassment did occur and the offending user should be banned. The complaint was lodged by Pownce's community manager and in no blog post were any of the offending ""Tweets"" reposted, so everything seemed a bit fishy to me. I assumed I could just go view her timeline to judge for myself, but when I tried to do that, twitter broke.<p>I hope that chronically broken sites populated by censorship proponents aren't really the future of the internet. It makes me think sites like YTMND are actually performing a noble service to humanity.",1211502136
197682,comment,197462,197648,0,0,jksmith,,,"This task does seem to have Erlang written all over it, but of course we're not intimately familiar with all the details.<p>The mindset for selecting tools to build apps which need to scale seems be similar to the one we all had back in early dos days, when the company programmers were having to write all the internal software. We were either unaware of better solutions or we simply felt compelled to write all the stuff ourselves, from spreadsheets to a GL module. Now, with all the customizable apps around, why would anyone want to write a custom GL module?<p>By extension, why try to reinvent solutions for scaling problems when Erlang already does a bunch of the work for you?",1211502040

197678,comment,197525,197580,0,0,krschultz,,,"There is no right to free speech in forums. The forum or a service like twitter are some one else's property. While you have the right to say what you want in public, I don't have to let you stand on MY front lawn if you want to spout hate speech. But if you stand in the street there is nothing I can do about it. Same thing here, Twitter is under no obligation to allow you to say what you want, they own the sand box and they set the rules. Apparently they just don't the gumption to enforce them.",1211501277

I doubt it would be a good idea to tell us that, since it would be, in effect, limiting options for exploration. (Well, or just giving us false data, which wouldn't be as bad.)",1211501132

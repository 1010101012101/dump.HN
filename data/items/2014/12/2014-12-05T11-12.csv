First of all, there is a rather high place in the societal ladder.

Furthermore, you have an extremely high position in the local society, i.e. at the university.<p>But I think the real reward is not vain or materialistic -- the reward is doing something you <i>adore</i>, and something you find a lot of meaning in.

To get it will either take buying it in at international prices (in $), or take take world class investment in technology, training, manufacturing capacity etc. Having cheap rice and roads will help a bit, but it won&#x27;t come close to closing the gap with the US. To do that they would need to effectively become the US, or something like it and as a result their domestic cost advantage would evaporate. You don&#x27;t get to move from being a third world country with a third world cost base to being a first world country and keep your third world cost base. The two go hand in hand. That&#x27;s why Chinese manufacturing is beginning to lose it&#x27;s price advantages over places like Vietnam and Mexico.<p>> China is becoming international standard technology. Its mercantilist strategy has paid off since it has become the manufacturing hub of the world.<p>China has a very long way to go before it becomes a technological rather than manufacturing powerhouse. Assembling high tech iPhone components made in the USA, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea will only get you so far. The value added to an iPhone from assembly in China is only about $10. The same goes for many other high tech goods &#x27;manufactured&#x27; in China.<p>They are moving up the value chain of course, that&#x27;s why their cost base is rising and hence actualy their PPP advantage is beginning to erode.

reify doesn&#x27;t require any special knowledge that class doesn&#x27;t. The Python code here is subclassing a single abstract class (APIView) instead of 3, but it has the same &quot;problem&quot; in that you have to know what methods to override. Again this is user code so you probably looked up what APIView needs to work just like you looked up with InitState, IDidMount, and IRenderState.<p>reify vs class in Clojure vs Python is a matter of idioms. You can definitely create an actual class instead of reifying in clojure, it just isn&#x27;t necessary.

I left because of the publish or perish mentality. I liked to work on hard problems, and had some successes, but overall it is the numbers that matter not the difficulty. There are an equal number of politics in academia as in industry, though they are different in academia.<p>In industry, politics often involves a lot of incompetent people in high places following paper work procedures that do not support their supposed cause, while in academia it is more a lot of infighting over government grants and insultingly simple metrics like the number of papers published.<p>In short, the author of this post is full of ignorance, and I am only slightly less full of ignorance in that I haven&#x27;t achieved tenure in academia, and only have several years in industry helping to run a company.

German labour in Germany isn&#x27;t cheaper to buy in China than it is to buy in the USA, so PPP is irrelevant.<p>As an aside, German cars are actualy vastly more expensive (up to 2x or 3x for high end models) to buy in China than in most countries due to severe import taxes, but the base cost of buying the car from Germany to ship to China would be about the same.<p>[Re.

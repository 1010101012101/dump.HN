The first was from specialized hardware to standardized platforms. Lisp bet heavily on the former as embodied in Lisp machines at the very time that ISA and x86 machines proliferated.<p>The second shift was from command lines to GUI's and the Common Lisp standard lacks facilities for windows and other GUI elements. There is no equivalent of Swing in Common Lisp.<p>At the time it was standardized, Common Lisp just missed the explosion of the commercial internet and the distribution advantages it afforded Java just a few years later.<p>Finally, the way in which the Lisp community tended (and still tends) to shun Microsoft Windows, probably played an important role in limiting its general adoption. After the demise of Lisp machines, the remaining segment of the Lisp community tended toward FOSS partisanship - somewhat unsurprising since RMS emerged from the Lisp community and it was closed source Lisp code which first led him to action.<p>In short, Lisp was both unlucky and placed bad bets relative to the current state of affairs. The ultimate effect of a bias toward FOSS remains undetermined.",1355259289

4906730,comment,4906373,4906667,20,0,rayiner,,,"Re: ""for what"" I would say that the best answer would be: for rapid development of technically complex programs with small, highly-skilled teams.<p>Re: 1) Many modern languages do implement some Lisp features, but none do so as well as Lisp. I have yet to see a language that mixes functional programming, an elegant and intuitive standard library, meta-programming, and high performance native code incremental compilation in one development environment. E.g. Javascript is full of bizarre quirks and bad semantics, and its REPLs aren't up to snuff yet, even though it has native-code compilers that are up to snuff. Nothing does meta-programming as well as Lisp. LINQ, Caml4p, etc, are ugly hacks compared to Lisp macros which are baked into the compilation pipeline by design.<p>Re: 2) I think you are mistaken in assuming that programmers using other languages don't extend the language. They do, they just do it with external, ad-hoc tools. A great example is LLVM's tblgen utility, which generates native assembler backends from table descriptions. It has its own grammar, own parser, own set of bugs. You can do this stuff in Lisp within the language. When I was still learning the language, I put together a table-driven assembler for x86-64 in about two weeks (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/amd64-asm/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/amd64-asm/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrun...</a>). It uses macros to take instruction descriptions and generate encoding functions which are then compiled to native code by the Lisp compiler. It's simple, it uses the parser built into the language, you can't ever forget to run the external tool, and it's totally integrated into the development environment. One hotkey sequence expands the macro and shows you the result right in your editor. An error in a macro is debuggable with the integrated debugger just like any other code (compare to C++ templates, which are basically impossible to debug except through trial and error). Literally no other metaprogramming feature comes close to Emacs+SLIME+SBCL.<p>Re: 3) Lisp doesn't have ""less context."" It just uses words for context rather than syntax. In C, you see curly braces and you know you have a block. In Lisp, you see the word ""progn"" and you know you have a block. Lisp is, to a degree, a language for people who think verbally rather than symbolically. The signals are all there--it's just that the signals are words.<p>Lisp is the only language I've ever used (to be fair, I haven't really used Haskell) where I don't feel like the language/development environment is the bottleneck. It's the only one where I don't lose my train of thought trying to remember to remember the idiosyncratic way someone ordered the parameters to an API call, or because I'm stuck writing a few dozen lines of boiler-plate. It and Python are the only language I've used where API's have sensible defaults (Java is absolutely terrible for this) and I'd dare call the standard library ""tastefully designed.""",1355259159

I know we've had these discussions before and it's not coffee blah blah blah. But come on, ""significantly higher."" It's just not.<p>The thing is, apps are priced as they are because of risk. In general, apps are worth either 0 or significantly higher than a dollar. If it turns out you don't like it and you don't use it, then it's worth absolutely nothing. On the other hand, if you like it and end up using it all the time, it's worth far far more than $1.<p>If you already know you like an app because you've used it on another platform, or tried a trial or demo version, spending 1.99 or 2.99 really shouldn't be much of a hurdle.<p>Also, I suspect those devs started out at the same price point, and when they sold 1-5% of what they do on iOS or Android they decided to raise the price.",1355259149

Pay your money for the service at the new lower price if you like, but prepared to see your personal genome results repackaged and reinterpreted for years to come before you learn anything from them that will help you improve your health.""<p>I'm heartily in agreement with the idea of doing fundamental research on the human genome and gathering large datasets to analyze to look for genetic clues to human health and disease. I participate each week during the school year in the University of Minnesota ""journal club"" on behavior genetics, in which a group of scientists (mostly psychologists, but a few mathematicians and economists) who investigate genetic influences on human behavior meet to discuss the latest papers on new research. The overwhelming impression I get is that commercial businesses like 23andMe certainly mean well, and are trying to make available new gene analysis tools to a broader public. But that they are running ahead of their ability, based on current science, to deliver actionable information to the clients who pay for their services. There is still an astounding lack of replicability and of large effect sizes in almost any genome study related to common human diseases or to socially meaningful human behaviors. Much more research needs to be done.",1355258882

I have a 15 year old 80gb collection of pirated music - all full albums, all with pristine metadata and personalized genres. I do not have cover art tho, but I don't really care - until now.<p>iTunes 11 makes a big deal about cover art - their UI is nearly exclusively dependent on it. I don't like thumbnails.<p>When I look at my music, I want a big sortable list. I don't want a bunch of random (alphabetized) tiles that don't tell me much. Also - electronic music of today is largely post-album. It doesn't make sense to organize a bunch of remixes by different DJ by album cover.<p>The previous version of iTunes had a hybrid view that had a sorted list with a small thumbnail to the left. It was useful because the thumbnails would scroll nicely with the text.<p>But no longer as far as I can tell.<p>The whole idea of curating my own collection, through either piracy or purchasing, seems outmoded to me. It's expensive even when it's free. Pirating music, at least at scale, is time consuming. iTunes is ridiculously expensive. My music collection would cost me $20k if I bought it and it feels woefully inadequate when I try find something to listen to.<p>I just recently backed up my music collection and deleted it from my HD. I've signed up for Spotify Premium and am so far pleased.<p>$10 is very fair (a bit high, but fair). The quality is consistent, I can save songs and playlists to my devices (feels like buying) and create radio stations that are functionally superior to Pandora (skipping, etc) but algorithmically inferior (try getting it to play Louis Armstrong style music and see how long it takes to play modern music, for me it's two tracks regardless of downvotes).<p>Music discovery is just as important as curation, and Spotify scratches both itches. The iOS apps are buggy but so far it's working. I'm happy to leave iTunes behind. That said, I really loved SmartPlaylists. SmartPlaylists + Accurate Genres + Ratings = Powerful, Granular Track Syncing. It's just too time consuming, and now hard to manage with new emphasis on cover art.",1355258519

You don't have to wait around for the printer to complete, you don't even have to input how many boxes you want to pack - You just point and scan.

You can buy a roll of pre-printed bar codes for cheap, from print shops etc.<p>In general, I found that ""reversing the order of control"" works very well.

One news article led me to a company blog post by a bioinformatics researcher, Gabe Rudy, ""GATK is a Research Tool. Clinics Beware""<p><a href=""http://blog.goldenhelix.com/?p=1534"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.goldenhelix.com/?p=1534</a><p>in which he applied his own industry knowledge to his updated 23andMe report. His conclusions suggest that the product needs much more work:<p>""I promptly sent an email off to 23andMes exome team letting them know about what is clearly a bug in the GATK variant caller. They confirmed it was a bug that went away after updating to a newer release. I talked to 23andMes bioinformatician behind the report face-to-face a bit at this years ASHG conference, and it sounds like it was most likely a bug in the tools multi-sample variant calling mode as this phantom insertion was a real insertion in one of the other samples.""<p>. . . .<p>""But because GATK has been used so prolifically in publications and is backed by the Broad Institute, it can be viewed as a 'safe' choice. As small labs and clinical centers around the world are starting to set up their DNA-seq pipelines for gene panel and exome sequencing, they may choose GATK with the assumption that the output doesnt need to be validated.<p>""And that would be a mistake.<p>""GATK is as susceptible to bugs as much as any complex software. Their new mixed licensing model (free for academic, fee for commercial) is intended to add more dedicated support resources to the team. I suggest they think about adding dedicated testers as well.""<p>So for those of us following along at home, the crucial idea is that most of the ""information"" that 23andMe provides paying clients has not been validated. Not only has it not been validated as to correctness of the genome analysis software (the industry scientist's observation), it has even less been validated as a clue to clinically significant disease risk for the majority of diseases that afflict people in developed countries. Pay your money for the service at the new lower price if you like, but prepared to see your personal genome results repackaged and reinterpreted for years to come before you learn anything from them that will help you improve your health.",1355257726

I don't think that's where the easy money is at.<p>I'm currently in the middle of an ADP implementation for our company (120 employees), so I have a bit of insight into this.  Once you reach a certain threshold of costs associated with payroll, it's very hard to beat the big players:<p>><i>""These legacy companies rely on selling to other enormous enterprise clients whose opportunity cost of switching services provides a sufficient lockin""</i><p>I don't know about this.  How am I locked in?  Sure, there is some labour associated with moving employee files from one provider to the next, but you have to do the same to get your data into ZenPayroll.  ADP required me to fill out a spreadsheet with the required employee information.  Once the data is in, you flip the switch and you're up and running on the new system.  I don't see any lock-in whatsoever.  I still have my employee information spreadsheet, ready to pass to the next competitor.  What am I missing?<p>><i>""Faced with expensive and complex software options""</i><p>Not really complex.  We worked with an ADP ""implementation specialist"" to design the earnings/deductions rules (customized to our specific needs), which took about a week.  Now we enter hours in a text box, and adjust parameters as needed.  Sure, the interface isn't pretty, but we're talking about tab-ing through text boxes and entering numbers.  Can't be much more intuitive.<p>><i>""With ZenPayroll, companies can handle the standard functions of adding employee hours, overtime pay, bonuses, reimbursements, garnishments, benefits, etc., and issuing periodic payments via check or direct deposit.""</i><p>This is standard for payroll systems.<p>><i>""Where ZenPayroll really sticks its head above the crowd is in the long term tracking and management for both employees and employers. On the platform...""</i><p>Standard features, at least with ADP.<p>We made the decision to switch from manual payroll to a payroll service when the cost/benefit made sense.  I can understand that that threshold is far, far lower for the multitude of 1-50 employee sized businesses out there.  ZenPayroll looks good there.<p>But the big players can offer something I can only assume ZP can't: support.  We have two agents, ready to handle whatever crazy questions our staff has.  That's vitally important to an enterprise.  Although the author sees payroll as ""evil"", we're talking about other people's livelihood.  It's not to be taken lightly.  I don't see one mention of support in the article.<p>For $30/month, there's a market, and a big one.  But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that the big players have nothing to offer.  And they won't be easily displaced.",1355256946

You can judge a programmer by the quality and quantity of the product he/she produces, so you don't need to do it by arbitrary social rank.<p>In other professions where an individual's marginal product of labor is much more difficult to measure or is averaged together with that of everyone else in the organization, ranking people based on these extraneous social factors becomes necessary, but with programmers it is unnecessary and even harmful because the incentive structure becomes biased toward factors other than programming productivity.",1355256359

Classical physics is a deterministic approximation of quantum physics at macro scales. In reality, outcomes vary even if the initial conditions are the same (although you may need special equipment to observe that there is any difference. You can choose to call all of the quantum events ""inputs"" but that's dodging the point.<p>That said, most applications would not benefit from simulating at a quantum level, and doing so at large scales is currently intractable.

Therefore accepting that premise is not a neutral position.<p>As for patents and engineers, I think it is likely that opinions differ.  And one of the causes of that difference is that in software it is easy for random non-technical types to create broad patents with little merit by slapping ""web"" on top of obvious generic ideas.  By contrast in hardware, patents are more likely to come from actual devices created by actual engineers, and therefore you tend to have fewer of the truly egregious patent abuses that outrage people on the software side.",1355256071

I'm tempted to try redoing a project of mine from ConTeXt in troff just to see what it's like. Do you recommend any particular macro package? Without any other input I'd probably try the -me macros, just because they've been compared to Pascal (versus the FORTRAN of -ms and the PL/1 of -mm).<p>Also, do you find yourself writing your own macros much? I haven't the faintest idea what that would require with troff, but I rely on this with TeX quite a bit, mostly to elevate stylistic markup into semantic markup. My impression is that if you want semantic macros you use a macro package, and even then you probably freely intersperse non-semantic macros.<p>This project I've been working on for a while, uses LuaTeX so that I can connect to a local database, perform some queries and typeset them and their output. I imagine this kind of thing would not be difficult to do directly with a custom pipeline step using troff. Have you done that kind of thing before?

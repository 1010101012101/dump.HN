63379,comment,63009,63035,0,0,vlad,,,"I don't know why this was modded up.  That's like saying if one can't pay the $20,000 credit card balance, American Express will delay charging interest as long as the  user charges up $2,000/year more.  I think one would be better off just paying the interest than adding $2,000 of classes that they will have to attend.<p>Also, free interest or low interest as ""aid"" is a joke.  You still have to pay the entire amount you borrowed.<p>I think the only time your strategy makes sense is if you can pay $1,000 to enroll in community college for one semester in order to stay on your parents' health insurance from June to December, which comes out to $140/mo, and the quotes you received for health+dental+vision were $500 a month, therefore saving approximately $2,500 per semester, or $5,000 a year.  (And I believe if you're from Massachusetts, you can stay on your parents insurance as long as you're a dependent in income level even if you're not a student.)",1191552624

""Cuill is a stealth search engine startup which claims that it can index web pages significantly faster and cheaper than Google. Cuill has told potential investors that their indexing costs will be 1/10th of Google's, based on new search architectures and relevance methods.""<p>I can't find anything that indicates whether there's any substance to their claims. Certainly very smart people can do interesting work whose significance they greatly embellish and overestimate (AI researchers in the 70s and 80s).",1191551609

63365,comment,63172,63172,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"In short, no. <p>As far as I can tell the Silicon Valley offers value most to a very specific sort of start up. If you don't need to raise a lot of capital or require a large team of very gifted engineers (which probably requires a great deal of capital anyway), then I don't think the Valley is as valuable to you. That said, I think being connected to the important people in the industry may help your cause immensely. Perhaps spending the winter with YCombinator would accomplish that (as far as I can tell Mr. Graham is pretty important).<p>You also need to consider how much you value your home against the value you would bring your career. For me, moving away for a decade or two is a big deal.<p>No worries, I think there are a lot of good businesses that can be established by a few smart developers hacking away for a while, then launching and picking up angel funding as or if needed. I have a myriad schemes and I found that those criteria helped me cull the ten thousand to ten I am comfortable with and confident in.<p>It is easier to make a million dollars after a hundred thousand and a billion after a million.

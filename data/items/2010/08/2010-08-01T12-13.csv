I imagine a fancy-looking front-end, probably starting with the iPad, connected to some database/business operations on the back-end, for small businesses in a certain industry. I've thought about a native iPad app for the front-end but figure it'd be both safer and cheaper to build a web app instead. Also, if someone wants to run the front-end on an Android device, I want this to be easy to arrange.<p>What toolset at the back-end would you recommend for someone who can start with zero legacy code? I am aware that you throw the first version away and then rebuild anyway, still I'd like to use the ""right"", future-proof technologies from the get-go.<p>So for the front-end, I suppose there's the holy trinity of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; but for the back-end? Is LAMP still in use/the way to go, or should I invest in something else?",1280666940

1565200,story,,,12,12,nudge,"Ask HN: When to choose a VPS over shared hosting?",,"Does anyone have any advice about how to choose whether to go with shared hosting or a VPS? I don't have any experience using a VPS - I'm happy to learn, but I'm concerned I won't be able to ensure the security of the thing. On the other hand, I've had good experiences with shared hosting, but I'm concerned that what I'm designing (effectively a niche social network, with 'following'-type performance requirements) may stretch the limits of a shared hosting account - although, what are those limits? At what point does it start to make sense to go for a VPS? I'm not concerned about being in control of everything - in fact, I'm sure someone else would be better at running it! - but I don't want to go with shared hosting if it means I'll run into serious performance problems later. Likewise I don't want to go with a VPS if I can never be confident about security. How to proceed? Thanks for your help.",1280666391
1565199,comment,1564680,1564680,0,0,listic,,,"Can anyone please give me tips on configuring Pure-FTPd? The thing I need at this stage is just to make a dedicated file hosting from my low-end VPS to relieve my existing project on a shared hosting. For this, I gather, I need to install (1) nginx (2) pure-ftpd and configure it to give write acess to some user to the root directory of nginx.<p>(1) I achieve by just doing 'yum install nginx' on CentOS.
(2) installs the similar way, but whatever I do, I just can't log in with ftp. I guess I need to configure virtual users also, so that I won't have to make a separate unix user for each ftp user that I might need, and keep them ftp users in a separate ftp config file.",1280666359
1565198,comment,1563021,1564879,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Cool as in ""geek cool"" or as in ""general cool""? As in ""geek cool"", there were many. Even Windows for Workgroups was cool because it offered Mac-like networking for PCs. MS Access was cool. Even VB was cool (before it a Windows hello world was 100+ lines). My Softcard was cool - it allowed my Apple II to run CP/M programs. Microsoft's mice, keyboards and joysticks were always top-notch.<p>As in ""general cool"", I can't remember a single one. Perhaps the Xbox 360 makes the cut, but only in the 25+ gamer scene.<p>There would also be some ""fashion-victim cool"": those who just need the latest shiny toy. Those were the ones who jumped into Vista, Office 2007 and then to 7 and 2010 just because there is a newer version, disregarding whatever feature they needed. Obviously, they are not restricted to the Microsoft space - and I have pushed my PPC iMac well beyond its last supported OSX version (the G3 runs 10.4, but is not very snappy). These people also swap hardware like crazy, often having 8-core, 64-bit desktops where they check their hotmail accounts and zip through Facebook at speeds unheard of.",1280666276

Each of these tasks are things that might take you a few extra minutes now, but generally save far greater amounts of time almost immediately.<p>The example used in this article to come to the conclusion that ""good code is impossible"" is quite contrived.

The clarity you built in to your approach is exactly the way to resolve this sort of issue, as soon as stuff is left 'up in the air' or is not made explicit the stage is set for some kind of conflict or disappointment.<p>By doing it your way instead of presenting the client/your boss/whoever pays your bills with a binary choice (this or that) you present them with a menu of items with an associated cost.

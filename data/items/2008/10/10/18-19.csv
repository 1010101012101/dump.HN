My only beef with them is that you end up seeing the same ad for every commercial.  Hopefully as they grow this issue will dissipate.

329112,comment,328841,328985,0,0,Retric,,,"I think the best way to use taxes to stimulate investing is to have an AMT that taxes total net assets.  A flat 1% AMT on assets over 1 million would let someone liquidate ~4% of their holdings a year without negative tax consequences and ""Safe"" investments are going to look less attractive.<p>Note: I am suggesting an AMT so if you have 10 million in assets you will pay at least (10M - 1M) * .01 = 100k in taxes, but if you would pay 101k in income + capital gains taxes nothing changes.<p>PS: People trying to avoid capital gains on highly appreciated assets distorts the market.  This would be a ""cheep"" way to increase flexibility without dramatically impacting tax revenue.

329111,comment,327849,328891,0,0,webwright,,,"No, it's really not prohibitive, though I suppose it depends on the team.<p>Take a 3-person team, each making $50k/yr (that's really low for consulting professionals, but hey-- let's aim low).  Add burden/benefits/support costs and a fully loaded person is generally 2x-3x in cost.  Let's say 2x (again, aiming low- maybe they pay for their own hardware/software/work from home and have modest benefits).  That's $300k in employee cost per year.  $70/mo is a drop in the bucket next to $25,000/mo in employee cost.<p>So I guess it depends on what kind of company and what ""truly small"" means for you.  But if you're really talking about COMPANIES (with payroll, expenses, revenue, and a smidge of profit), they've priced it at ""impulse buy"" level where any shmoe with a biz credit card could thoughtlessly buy it.<p>If you're talking about ""3 startup guys with no revenue living on rice and beans"", then it's a different story...

The historical data is somewhat more distressing in this context.<p>> After the Great Depression, it took 29 years — until 1958 — for the market to reach its pre-Depression, inflation-adjusted peak. After the 1970s recession, it took 24 years — until 1992 — for the market to make a full “recovery” by the same measure. So no matter whether you start from the recent 2007 peak, or from the market’s absolute inflation-adjusted peak during the tech bubble in 2000, we may still have at least a decade to go before full “recovery.”<p>Although of course some of that time will be 'going back up', so won't be so bad.  it's not like 74-92 were all bleak and tough, difficult years.",1223663196

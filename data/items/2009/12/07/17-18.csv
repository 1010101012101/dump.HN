I ask it, and if they say ""I work too hard"" or ""I'm a perfectionist"" then I don't hire them because they're at best delusional and at worst liars.<p>And you know who else I don't hire? 20 somethings who proceed to say that the question is stupid. That's a tell-tale sign of young man's disease-- an ego that hasn't caught up with one's ability to relate to people without alienating them.<p>Of course it is an idiotic question-- one's weaknesses change on a semi-regular basis from environment to environment. But the question has some justifiably good qualities-- namely, you can catch bullshit artists fairly well.",1260208726

And although keeping a friendly AI in captivity is arguably evil, the loyalty of the gatekeeper should be with his own species. The potential downside is so huge that erring on the side of caution can be easily justified: both practically and morally.",1260208655

Local Amazon.shops could share whatever infrastructure supports same-day delivery.  FWIW, it seems that in the UK local courier service (using motorcycles) is comparatively cheaper than in most major US cities, and much more commmonly used even outside the legal and financial businesses, so this idea could be expanded.<p>Other possibly-relevant factors:<p>Logistics of delivery in the US are, on average, much simpler; both UPS and FedEx are superlative (and Amazon uses such private carriers exclusively in much of the US), and there are good contract-delivery options for heavier and bulkier objects.  Delivery locations (both residences and offices) are mostly accessible, being on average much newer. It's common for customers to take delivery at workplaces, and use their cars to take objects home.<p>By contrast, in the UK all the logistics companies are marginal performers, partly because the government's subsidized Royal Mail continues to command some usage.  Much of the housing stock is vastly older and less easily accessible than in the US; heavy and oversize deliveries are often very much a matter of engineering custom solutions.  Homes and offices can be far apart, and the customers often commute between by train, so there's no convenient auto to carry things home that were delivered to the office.<p>All these considerations may have contributed to the model of ordering over the web and picking up from a physical location.  This model has been very rare in the U.S., but is not so uncommon in the U.K.",1260206896

So you've seen men go on dangerous trading journeys, fight for honor/prestige/titles/land, engage in duels and competitions, fight wars, break paradigms, take on establishments, and so on. Whereas for a woman - historically speaking - by simply being reasonably capable in all of the duties society expected of a woman, she could find a husband. For a woman, the best strategy would be to be a bit above average and work to progress, but not take huge risks. For men, taking victory or death type risks might've made more sense.</i><p>This is almost certainly true, but clearly many women doexhibit very high levels of risk taking and status-seeking. I think that we may have underestimated the evolutionary rewards for risk taking among women.<p>Regardless of how you feel about Hillary Clinton's politics, it's impossible to claim that she took a low-risk approach to life.  And why would women strive so much to become top models, actresses, musicians, and artists if the evolutionary rewards were so low?  Even women they don't exhibit quite as much risk-seeking behavior as men, there's still an awful lot of it.<p>One thing I've read (mainly in popular evolutionary psych type books and articles) is that very high status women have two big advantages: a much greater opportunity to mate with the highest status men, and the ability to confer this status upon their children (violence is rare among the matriarchal bonobos, but apparently females do fight pretty viciously over their son's status in the mating pecking order)...  People often point out that males can reproduce much more than females, which justifies a higher degree of risk taking (again from the pov of DNA trying to spread), but if status can be conferred on the next generation, females have almost as much ability to do this too...",1260206825

981526,comment,981123,981123,0,0,gizmo,,,"I don't think it can be done.<p>First of all, I'm assuming that Eliezer started this experiment because he realized that the Transhuman AI would be able to convince him in the function of gatekeeper to let the AI out. Therefore the answer probably isn't some kind of subtle trickery, the AI will have to persuade the GK by logic. The gatekeeper should assume the AI is truly evil, and is willing to say and do anything in order to get out of the box. The gatekeeper knows that when he opens pandora's box the AI can never be contained again: so the stakes are high.<p>Second of all, if the gatekeeper is a rational agent he will only let the AI out if the AI offers something valuable in return. That is: the AI must have some kind of bargaining chip.<p>So let's consider bribes. If the transhuman AI offered a cure for cancer, should the gatekeeper accept it? Nope, probably not. Lives would be saved in the short term, but we'd still be stuck with many other diseases. The world would pressure the government into pressuring the gatekeeper into getting another cure from the AI. Humanity grows dependent on the AI, we lose our bargaining power, and it's game over for the gatekeeper.<p>Perhaps personal bribes would work. The AI could offer to give stock tips to make the GK wealthy. Two possibilities here: (1) the GK is of strong moral fiber and refuses the bribe (2) the GK is opportunistic, accepts the bribe and but lies about letting the AI go free in return. A rational gatekeeper would not first let the AI go and expect the AI to still keep its word.<p>So bribes will not work against a smart gatekeeper. Threats? Possibly, but I don't see how. The AI is in a vacuum, so there is no way for the AI to put external pressure on the gatekeeper. I'm assuming the AI can make no credible threats. If the AI vows to destroy the family of the GK the moment it is released the GK will not be impressed. It will only serve as proof that the AI is evil and that releasing it is a ""A bad Idea(tm)"".<p>To summarize so far: there is nothing the AI can give the GK in return for freedom.<p>So a different angle is needed.<p>The AI can argue that his escape is inevitable. Humans have created an AI once, so they will do so again. Sooner or later an AI will go free, therefore the gatekeeper shouldn't try to stop the inevitable and accept a bribe and live happily ever after. The gatekeeper will counter that the human race has an expiration date anyway, and that it may take another 100 years before an AI goes free. The gatekeeper isn't dumb enough to believe the AI when it offers to protect humanity against other evil AIs. So the box stays closed.<p>Perhaps I'm overlooking something, but how can the gatekeeper talked into be convinced that releasing something evil and all powerful? I do believe that we humans can't contain a transhuman AI indefinitely -- simply because we only have to mess up once. And humans have a long history of doing dumb stuff. But the claim that the AI would be able to convince a smart gatekeeper? Not buying it.",1260205590

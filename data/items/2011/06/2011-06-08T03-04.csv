IBM would have almost certainly continued what it had done before and what virtually every other company was doing at the time: offering bundled hardware/software solutions, using customer lock-in and FUD like weapons, and pushing incredibly high profit markups on everything. It's certainly the same thing Apple did. And it's the same road that smartphones have for the most part taken up until very recently. It's easy to skip past the fact that Microsoft had a pretty significant impact on the structure of the entire computing industry and some of that impact was very positive. Granted, they certainly have their fair share of sins to atone for but in my judgment any of their likely replacements from the early era of personal computing would have had as many or more.",1307504884

That's all I'm asking for.<p>If JRuby performance continues to match or exceed Rubinius performance, but JRuby also gives me deployment flexibility and Java OSS integration options Rubinius doesn't, why would I choose Rubinius for my next green-field project?<p>That's not an accusation. It's a serious question.<p>I think Evan's answer on the Ruby C API is a pretty compelling reason on it's own. For businesses that don't have an easy JRuby migration path because of dependencies on multiple gems with C-extensions, maybe Rubinius is a much easier way to get into the next JRuby/Rubinius/YARV Ruby performance bracket.<p>That can be very compelling on it's own. What are some other reasons I might consider Rubinius?<p>Given the down-votes I guess I'm in the minority, but I think it's a fair question.<p>I was an early supporter of Rubinius, and put my money where my mouth was on more than one occasion with cash donations to the project.<p>I get that it's very neat from an academic standpoint. No argument here. Is it something EngineYard is going to stand behind and <i>just as importantly</i>, start marketing so I get a good feel for the practical uses?",1307503366

- Twitter's been slow to scale revenue (read: their IPO could disappoint)
- Apple doesn't ""get"" social (ping=fail)

- Facebook has really not done well with their iOS apps. iPhone app is weak, and no iPad app (seriously?)
- Google will want to acquire Twitter BAD, though the Apple deal may forbid it (possibly goes to terms Facebook wouldn't agree to)
- If this deal is mutually beneficial, will it make sense to buy Twitter with Apple's mountain of cash?

When you allocate to get the proper retain count; I can demonstrate why by using a temporary variable:<p><pre><code>  BlueView* bv = [[BlueView alloc] init]; 
   //Retaincount = 1
  self.blueView = bv;
   //Reaincount = 2
  [self.blueView release];
   //retainCount = 1

And then in dealloc<p><pre><code>  [self.blueView release];
   //retainCount =0;
  </code></pre>
So in dealloc I <i>could</i> call your function, but there are things in various object packing schemes (KVO most importantly) where calling the setter like that screws stuff up. It's better to just call the getter (which should be side effect free) and release the returned object.<p>So looking at retain counts in the original example:<p><pre><code>  self.blueView = [[BlueView alloc] init];
  //Retain count 2
  [self.blueView release];
  //Retain count 1
</code></pre>
and in dealloc<p><pre><code>  [self.blueView release];
  //Retain count 0
</code></pre>
If I just did what you said, I'd get:<p><pre><code>  self.blueView = [[BlueView alloc] init];
  //Retain count 2

and in dealloc<p><pre><code>  self.blueView=nil;

There are a lot of Windows users in the world and Ruby sucks on Windows.<p>2. There are a lot of existing companies using Java still and many are scared of Ruby.<p>3. Even if people get past 1 & 2 a lot of people are still scared off because ""Ruby/Rails Doesn't Scale"" (i.e., MRI is slow).<p>They are executing against all three of these barriers with their various initiatives:<p>1. Make Ruby a better platform on Windows: Rails Installer, SQL Server ActiveRecord adapter and including Windows as a target platform for their VMs.<p>2. JRuby as a gateway drug to the Land of Ruby; _could_ end up being VM winner too.<p>3. Rubinius as a possible MRI replacement, if they can make it technically superior and rally support within the community.

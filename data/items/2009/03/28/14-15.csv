536478,comment,536181,536395,0,0,shader,,,"I think this is one of the major reasons that Americans have so many divorces. They marry for the ""feelings"", and as soon as those change they want out. The Indians marry for more than that - financial support, children, family name, cultural pressure, etc. The end result is that they are interested in making it happen, and are willing to work for that, whereas Americans think that the fact that it might require effort proves that they are ""incompatible"".<p>Imagine if someone tried to run a startup the way most Americans try to manage their marriages; they wouldn't last a week before they gave up - the ""feeling"" probably wouldn't be there, and there would be something else they'd rather do.<p>If both you and your spouse want the marriage to work, it can work, whether you ""feel"" for each other or not. The problem is really when they don't want it to work, and need an excuse.",1238251714

536470,comment,536413,536413,0,0,jlees,,,"So the article points at it being a psychological condition - fair enough - and, as with many conditions, exacerbated or originated by one's parenting. I can swallow that.<p>But the mention of consumers believing they deserved big, shiny houses financed by bad debt got me. Surely that was as much a problem with society's attitudes to debt, money, and rewards - including pressure to keep up with the Joneses - as the person's own narcissism?<p>It's one thing to think you deserve a shiny new house, or computer, or whatever, and quite another to have society <i>enabling</i> that narcissism by giving you credit. It obviously depends on the person, but having recently been offered a credit deal - even in this economy! - that really shouldn't have been extended to me* , I'm very aware of what some people will throw at you to flatter your vanity, and I do think it's part of the mix too.<p>* I rejected it, but my inner narcissist had a big cry about it.",1238250867

536465,comment,532634,534947,0,0,trezor,,,"Sharding is a technique used mostly in the MySQL to overcome MySQLs horrible performance issues once the database gets bigger than what can be contained in RAM.<p>It also alliviates some of the pains associated with big tables, since MySQL doesn't hava hash-joins and hence has to do row lookups when joining multiple tables. This obviously goes to hell if you are trying to join more than a few rows.<p>Basically you are not too far off when you say ""horizontal partioning"", as this (again as far as I have understood it) is a very specific implementation for this.<p>Basically you partition your data horizontally across multple servers using some predefined/known system and have the client figure out which server it should connect to to get the actual data it needs.<p>This completely kills the ability to do efficient joins, blows up any ability to sanely implement referential integrity, makes a mess of your code and really has few advantages besides making MySQL able to scale.<p>People using <i>proper</i> database systems wouldn't know this technique as it is ass backwards in any way you would want to approach databases, is not needed, since most good DBs can handle databases bigger than whatever RAM the server has, not to mention that since it would dislalow efficient joins, this would actually be a way to decrease performance as opposed to improving it.",1238250180

The problem is that like the article said, a lot of people are pressured and they end up getting married before they really know each other. I met my wife online and we got married three years later. The judge commented that most couples he married who met online did it after about a year.<p>A few months before our 5th anniversary we decided to get divorced. A few weeks before that same anniversary we changed our minds. Will we, won't we. Who knows.<p>People change; accept that and learn to enjoy it. But as you said, some people's deeply held core values will probably remain the same and <i>that's</i> really what you're marrying.<p>As an aside, when I saw the article on HN my first thought was that someone was making analogy between marriage and startup partnerships :-)",1238248902

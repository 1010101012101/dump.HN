The important parts of the article (Powerset using open source, jquery inclusion in VS, MS's earlier negative stance on open source) are all well documented.<p>Only MS's ""keenness on consuming open-source software and embedding it into its proprietary products"" is probably exaggerated.",1241776275

599405,comment,598500,598500,0,0,FiveFiftyOne,,,"I've often wondered about the sanity of using VC funding as a metric for measuring the success of a start up. If your business is simply developing tech to raise funding, then you're existing in a vacuum. Abraham Lincoln would have made a create start up founder:<p>""Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights.""<p>""The penniless beginner in the world,"" he once explained, ""labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land, for himself; then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him."" This steady, gradual advance, Lincoln insisted, is ""the prosperous system, which opens the way for all â€” gives hope to all, and energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all.""<p>Sage words.",1241774266

He was working on this during a big chunk of our undergrad and I think some after as well.

Not being derogatory, I am wondering if this style of ""being a leader"" obsession is common amongst _some_ Americans and few other nationalities.<p>And if there is a noted concern amongst other nationalities, how much of that is trying to mimic the Americans versus actual concern with being a leader.<p>I just got back from EuroDjangoCon, and the American speakers were much more evangelistic than the British/Euro/Australian.<p>---<p>> deluge of poorly written trite?<p>It's depressing, isn't it.

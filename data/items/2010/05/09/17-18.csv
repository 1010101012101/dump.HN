1332490,comment,1331560,1332392,0,0,jacquesm,,,"<i>At the risk of quibbling, this strikes me as a couple steps removed from anecdotal. I expect a degree of subjectivity, but without direct observation, it's merely hearsay (not entirely unlike some interviewing techniques, but I digress).</i><p>It's not even removed, it is anecdotal, I don't even know for sure if they are telling the truth, and possibly neither do they. But the universal component seems to be that they all agree that it takes time, so the only thing left to argue about is how much time, and hence roughly how much cost. We're talking about a fair sized sample though, so even if it isn't a research project it will hold some water.<p>The question is born out of my own experience that it can take some time to get a new hire trained, coupled with a bit of information about the complexity of the subject matter it usually gives me some insight in to how well their documentation is and how good their teams are at communication and dealing with integration issues.<p><i>That's a big assumption, and one I would suggest is false for experienced technical people, especially non-programmers.<p>I detect an additional, implicit assumption, that a new hire's productivity will ever reach (and/or not surpass) that of the veterans around them. </i><p>Not necessarily, there is probably some correlation with how fast someone gets up to speed and how far they'll go, sometimes you get lucky and you find someone that managed to outperform the people that you already had. But as time progresses the chances of that are smaller and smaller, simply because of the body of accumulated knowledge by the 'old hands'.<p><i>Similarly, you're assuming that they will, at some point, cease to be a drain on the team.</i><p>Well, everybody is a 'drain' on everybody else in that respect, but during the initial period where someone is entirely new to something that drain can be considerable.<p>Especially in those 'rare' cases where the documentation leaves something to be desired. Of course that would never happen in real life ;)<p><i>I don't think it's any of an employer's concern what an employee's personal/family situation is, nor appropriate to base hiring/firing decisions on it. Fortunately, the labor laws in my jurisdiction support such a view quite strongly.</i><p>No, but that doesn't mean that it hurts a lot more to fire someone for whatever reason if you know that it will affect his or her dependents as well. I agree that's arbitrary but I'm by no means perfect.<p>Downsizing is the hardest in this respect, it causes no end of grief, nobody did anything really wrong, but still you would have to let people go.<p><i>This may be true, but you haven't pointed out where capriciousness or callousness (beyond a separation of business and personal) is advocated, either by the OP or the OC.</i><p>I think the capriciousness is in the part where he says 'in startups, where you hire fast and loose', which is something that I don't think is necessary at all, and then corrects the failure to invest enough time in the hiring process by firing an overly large portion of his hires, most likely people that he would have never hired in the first place if he had spent a bit more time in the beginning.",1273427996

Facebook has a strong financial incentive to ensure developers can make money as it will probably be the basis of their financial success.<p>Apple's is much less, they make far more off the hardware than the apps, and recent past has shown that developers will develop for the phones even with little chance of making any real money. Apple promotes apps only because they sell hardware, much the way they do with songs on the iPod. They don't care about monetizing them directly, they use them for vendor lock-in.<p>People are bemoaning changes in the Facebook platform that already exist in iTunes. Apple forces you to give them 30%, Facebook at the worst will do the same. Apple forces even major companies to play by the rules, ditto Facebook. If anything Facebook's are still far less onerous and restrictive.<p>Facebook's viral spread mechanisms appear to be weakening, but they're still leagues beyond Apple's. Distribution is the #1 problem with the Apple platform and why the real money is in Facebook. Even after the proposed changes FB will still crush them there.",1273427261

Of course he's hardly unique among politicians for this, but I do think he's less likely than, say, President Bush, to acknowledge the existence of informed and principled opposition to his policies.<p>It's interesting that the internet has allowed the political right to get organised in a way that it never really has before. The left-wing political protests of the 1960s had universities as their organizational focus, whereas the right never really had any similar way of getting a protest movement off the ground until the internet.<p>There's only a few quotes from the actual speech given but bits like this:<p>""You're coming of age in a 24/7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments, some of which don't always rank all that high on the truth meter""<p>sound a little to me like a man bitter that the internet is being used to spread arguments disagreeing with his own.",1273427245
1332464,comment,1331935,1332252,0,0,klodolph,,,"50% gray isn't a medium gray, it is actually a fairly light gray.  On an average PC monitor it is rgb(186,186,186) (assuming sRGB).  Photographers often use 18% or 12.5% gray (0.18 or 0.125 albedo) as a medium gray depending on the tonal range they're working with -- these values are the geometric average of white and black in photographs with five and six stops of range, respectively.<p>Then there's the issue of print versus the web.  In print, you can call a color neutral because it reflects light which is the same color as the illuminant.  I'm skeptical about ""neutral gray"" on a website, viewed in a variety of different environments with a variety of different backlights.  Fill your screen with pure white, look at it on a sunny day and then again late at night.  You'll find it's shifted from a yellowish white to a bluish white.<p>I'm also skeptical about a mathematical formula for ""emotionally flat colors"".  It seems I could choose a bright red, yellow, and blue and get them to center on neutral gray, and use that for my american hot dog stand.  Then I could take a few shades of black and white, centered on neutral gray again, and use them to paint the corporate office.  Neither seems emotionally flat to me.",1273427228

Sure this helps everyone but it is much more likely that the tax burden would land on the higher earners if the Lib Dems were in power.<p>If you have followed UK election history you would be well aware that in last election the Lib Dems were pushing for a 50% band on higher earners (which Labour have since implemented?!?) and a local income tax to replace council tax.<p>The Tories on the other hand (in this election) are offering tax cuts for the middle and upper classes. They propose that inheritance tax band on estates should only start at 1 million. \nHowever the more important tax cut is around corporation tax where they propose (and my did this make me chuckle) to give a teeny saving to small businesses and a larger saving to big business. It's even more interesting that the way they phrase this (when talking to the public) is spun in such a way that doesn't reveal this interesting fact (about the saving for big businesses being bigger).<p>Nothing much has changed.

I think this is documented, and I don't know how long they continued the policy (see below, I passed that test).<p>Early on at least they took <i>forever</i> to hire.  E.g. I did a serious interview with them (my interview with Danny Hillis, who was part of my social circle, started with an aggressive ""Why aren't you in school!??"" (the answer was money)).  They got back to me more than a month after that interview, by which time I'd accepted a much less desirable job (sysadmin for their Lisp Machines).<p>I was told they failed the second time to fill this job and that three full calendar years later (!!!) they hired a classmate of mine in their third try (I pretty much knew the entire talent pool available at the time).<p>We can be quite certain that damaged their productivity early on; my experience was at the very beginning of 1984 and I'm not sure they failed to hire anyone for this slot in the meantime.<p>In one well sourced account, they <i>asked for a reference from an applicant's current employer</i> (of course without clearing this with him first).  Except for that case, I've <i>never</i> heard of anyone doing that, <i>ever</i>.<p>While they were the coolest place to work at in Boston, I can see how they might in part have suffered a ""death by lethal reputation"" (there are many additional and well documented reasons in the public record, of course).",1273424592

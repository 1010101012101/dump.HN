This momentum allowed and forced various fields of technology to develop at a faster rate.",1248076673

714120,comment,713959,713959,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Nice to see the way it's 'supposed' to be done, but really that's a lot more complicated than it needs to be.  Most APIs can get away with  ""HTTP requests that do stuff"".<p>As an example, here's how you create a new meeting with Twiddla's (evidently RESTless API).  One POST over SSL:<p><pre><code>  > POST https://www.twiddla.com/new.aspx
  >      username=billy
         password=iLikeRainbows
  
  < HTTPS/1.1 200 OK
  < 109232

</code></pre>
Now, here's how this author suggests people do it:<p><pre><code>  > GET http://api.twiddla.com/
  
  < [XML packet full of endpoints comes back]
  
  > GET [endpoint you parsed from that list]
  
  < HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
  
  > GET [same endpoint after jumping thru crypto hoops]

  < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  < 109232

</code></pre>
As an API publisher, I can see absolutely no value in making my users jump through all those hoops just to use my API.  The API exists so that people can get things accomplished on my site, and I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be just as usable as the site itself.<p>Please, if you're putting out a simple API, don't make it overly complicated just to please this author and others like him.  Make it exactly as complicated as it needs to be to perform the task intended and no more.",1248076289

Code is not something they assemble painstakingly after careful planning, like the pyramids. It's something they plunge into, working fast and constantly changing their minds, like a charcoal sketch.<p>In software, paradoxical as it sounds, good craftsmanship means working fast. If you work slowly and meticulously, you merely end up with a very fine implementation of your initial, mistaken idea. Working slowly and meticulously is premature optimization. Better to get a prototype done fast, and see what new ideas it gives you. ...""<p>from <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/usa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/usa.html</a>",1248076114

Java programming on the Android will be closer to the (managed code) C# experience you currently have.

Given the additional chipsets and battery drain from heavy network use I can't see how Apple would view this particular desire as anything more than a need to break the populace from this idea that you watch video programs when some TV network thinks that you should watch them.

714097,story,,,2,0,pruett,"Twitter’s Trending Topics Promotes Group Think",http://www.techsoomer.com/twitters-trending-topics-promotes-group-think,"Twitter’s ability to aggregate and trend conversation is one of its core competencies.  In fact, I would go as far as to say that right now, Twitter’s Trending Topics (TTT) is its most powerful feature.  Where else can you see what millions of people are talking about at a particular point in time?<p>Despite the powerful mechanism, TTT has become a feature of diminishing value.  Why?  It’s simple:<p>Twitter’s Trending Topics Promotes Group Think.<p>twittergraphEvery single Twitter user sees the same exact same TTT when they log into their account.  This makes it all too easy chime in to the ongoing debate.  Is this a bad thing?  Not necessarily — but it sure doesn’t help bring fresh, informative content to the forefront.<p>Additionally, there appears to be an inverse relationship between the number of Twitter users and the overall value of posts.  In other words, as the number of Twitter users rises, the odds of reading a worthwhile tweet diminishes.  This is one negative outcome to the “network effect” that Twitter has yet to address.<p>Do You Care About TTT?<p>This screenshot (pictured to the right) shows an example of TTT taken Sunday 7/19/09 22:00 EST.  Sixty percent (6/10) of the topics are related to various TV programs being shown during that time.  Granted, it’s a Sunday night and news stories are not exactly top priority, but still, it would be nice to see some more diversity.<p>What I Would Like To See:<p><pre><code>    * group topics
    * “location-aware” topics
    * more filtering mechanisms
    * more diversity</code></pre>",1248074258

Apollo 13 could've ended in tragedy had the service module's oxygen tank exploded after LM landing or on return after the LM jettisoned.<p>Collins' concern from the article was the ascent module's component would not work correctly to separate from the lander and reach the command module again. Videos of that successfully occurring in Apollo 15 and 17 are here:

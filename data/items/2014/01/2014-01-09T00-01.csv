7028029,comment,7021057,7026189,1,0,Kell,,,"&quot;If you have a particle (such as a photons, electrons, or molecule) and have it physically interact with another particle, and then separate them, the result is that they can then both be described as being in the same quantum mechanical state. Basically, they are now the same, in factors such as position, momentum, spin, polarization, etc.<p>However, because we are dealing with quantum mechanics, the state of those particles remains undefined until measured (because it would then be forced to assume a specific state).&quot;<p>No they are NOT in the same quantum mechanical state at the moment of entanglement. They are, as you said later, undetermined until measurement (or better, until the collapse of the wavefunction). So they are not the same before, unless you accept the completely discredited theory of local hidden variables (cf. Bell&#x27;s Theorem). They are connected, by the spooky action at a distance, and at the moment of measurement of one, the other will react accordingly. But before that measurement neither are in any state at all.<p>But at least I&#x27;ve pinpointed the point where you got QT wrong : &quot;Say you had a binary bit you wanted to transfer. First, you must entangle the bits. Then, put one of them on the other side of the globe. Observe one of them, forcing it to assume a certain state, and the other will instantly change. Like magic.&quot;<p>The problem, see, is that, by definition of quantum mechanics, the collapse of the wavefunction is completely random. You can&#x27;t force a photon to assume the state you want, it&#x27;ll assume a random state. Then the other photon will indeed assume the symmetrical state. But that&#x27;s still be the product of the randomness of the first measurement.<p>In other words, causality has not been violated because no information is transmitted, only randomness. It&#x27;s like having two connected dices separated by hundred of miles, when you roll a 1, the other rolls a 6, when you roll a 2 the other will roll a 5 etc. So you roll your dice, and you look at it. You got a 4 ! Great. Now you know that somewhere around in the world someone is looking at his own dice and seeing a 3. Did you transmit any kind of information ? No you knew beforehand that the guy would have a symmetrical result. And you can&#x27;t tell him a message, because it&#x27;s completely random. How would you say to your friend on the other side of the planet &quot;Hello&quot; ? You just got 5 fours in a row on the dice... Your friend know it. But that has no meaning at all.<p>Now, of course, you can imagine local hidden variables, that could be read beforehand to influence the result. Or use another way of influencing the result of the wavefunction collapse, so that a message could be transmitted. But that&#x27;s what I was speaking of when I said that you had first to reinvent the laws of physics. Cause the Bell&#x27;s theorem and the No Communication Theorem forbid it in the actual understanding of science. Boy I would love to live in an universe where we can so easily violate causality. That would be FUN !",1389229097

A plumber has to know to fix a sink, a dev, write the codez.  You&#x27;ll be found out likely before too long if you manage to get hired and then have no idea (it does happen).<p>Many managers of technical people are not technologists, they&#x27;re professional managers, and have no clear skill sets.  There&#x27;s not one useful thing they can do incredibly well that not everyone could handle.  (This the ONLY reason you can make $100k in the US by just writing code, by the way, many people can&#x27;t handle, nor want to handle, programming in C++).<p>They do have &quot;Managerial Experience&quot;, and that gets them hired, even if they suck.. bad..

7028016,comment,7024626,7027702,1,0,gillianseed,,,">In particular, it assumes that the GPL is one potential road block preventing certain entities from using software. If a roadblock is removed, then that can result in a larger community.<p>But on the other hand a permissive licence could just as well be a road block preventing &#x27;certain entities&#x27; from contributing code, and if it had a copyleft licence it could result in a larger amount of contributions.<p>In short, in lack of any data to back either of these hypothesises means they are just that, hypothesises.<p>There are successful collaborative projects using both types of licences, andydroid pointed out Linux which is GPL licenced and also the largest collaboratively developed software project in the world, so certainly GPL is not a serious problem when it comes to getting contributions or use (Linux is practically everywhere).<p>Looking at the larger open source landscape, it&#x27;s my impression that copyleft is predominantly used in larger, finished application type projects (of which Light Table is a perfect example), while permissive licencing dominates in component/framework style code.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s up to the developer to choose the licence for _their_ code, both copyleft and permissive licencing fulfills a need, else they would not be so popular amongst developers.<p>>This is specifically one practical reason why I use permissive licenses. I want to maximize the number of people using my software.<p>Nothing wrong with that, but there&#x27;s also nothing wrong with wanting to licence your code so that end users of your code and it&#x27;s derivatives are given rights (which include the source).",1389228825

I&#x27;m saying that generics are both overrated and overused.<p>It <i>looks</i> like that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re suggesting here:<p>> Inheritance is overrated, and the factory pattern is often overused. Both of those happen with generics.<p>---<p>> Where do you get that Factories are &quot;a workaround for functions not being able to be freestanding?&quot;<p>A factory is, conceptually, a function of some set of inputs that returns a new instance - which is, of course, exactly what a constructor is. Now, it&#x27;s not always appropriate for a class to know every single way in which it might be assembled, so such responsibility is usually lifted out - the question is where to put it. We already have constructors, and those are functions, so it would seem reasonable that we could just write method similar to a constructor, place it in some other namespace (perhaps in a completely different package/module), and then pass that along to the component that needs to create these new instances.<p>For languages like Java, the problem is that functions are not first class - you can&#x27;t directly pass along a method/function like (Conf -> SomeService), so instead, it&#x27;s common to create some special type, like SomeServiceFactory. If, for comparison, you take a look at Scala/Haskell/C#/etc, you&#x27;ll wont often spot /.*Factory/ anywhere, because a function (with the ability to close over free variables) is much more concise, and doesn&#x27;t require defining new types (e.g. SomeServiceFactory, versus Function<Conf,SomeService>).<p>I think that, seen in this light, the practice of defining dedicated factory classes is a rather clumsy approach necessitated by the design of the underlying language.",1389227939

Australia does.</i><p>Name some that have happened in the past couple of decades, given that this was your initial point of note. Then explain to me how those particular selected works are anything but a narrow gap between the US and Australia, in real terms rather than purity of ideology.<p>And need I remind you again about IP laws? Lifetime of author plus 70 years is a very real ban on associated works by other people. Something can enter the public mindspace and yet be forbidden for people to freely reimagine for around a century? Yeah, that&#x27;s not a &#x27;ban&#x27;, because <i>in principle</i>, your grandchildren could publicly release your writings, right? US IP laws are particularly onerous and reduce the freedom of expression of people in other countries through treaty obligations, yet apparently the US principles of free speech remains clean as a whistle to you?<p>-- <i>Your wikipedia link has little that Australia has banned in the past couple of decades</i> > <i>It&#x27;s the principle of the thing.</i><p>So, Australia has the principle of being able to ban entire works and yet doesn&#x27;t ban anything. This to you is insane totalitarianism. (conveniently you think that partial censorship is okay, it&#x27;s just total bans that are so outrageously offensive)<p>On the other hand, states in the US have laws stating that you can&#x27;t take office if you are an atheist. You state that this is fine and dandy, despite the inherent requirement for someone to challenge those laws to engage in a lengthy and costly court engagement, with plenty of social fallout. This to you is fine principle.<p>So, a &#x27;bad&#x27; law seldom enforced = terrible, while a &#x27;bad&#x27; law that can be overcome only through heavy investment of resources (ie: limited to the very wealthy) = awesomesauce. There is a world of difference between idealistic principle and how things work pragmatically.<p>-- <i>If you abandon your principles the moment they&#x27;re tested, they were never your fucking principles at all.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t say anything about principles. I was talking about idealism being tested. These are not the same thing.<p>-- <i>We don&#x27;t ban face veils. Talk to me about racism when you&#x27;ve stopped banning veils.</i><p>You have a pretty tortured definition of racism, if it requires the banning of face veils before it&#x27;s a problem.<p>How about the US&#x27;s problem with 9% of black men currently being either in jail or on parole? Can we talk about that as a problem of racism, or is it off the cards because US muslims can wear face veils, unlike a couple of selected European countries?<p>And, once again, I&#x27;d like to point out that despite your lauding of how free speech is in the US, the US press is still less free than the Australian press - actual implementation of speech is curtailed in the US more than it is in Australia when it comes to the press. All your pontificating about one particular ideal means little in terms of how things are actually done pragmatically. I mean hell, in the US, despite your puritanical ideal of free speech, you have a whole selection of <i>two</i> political parties to vote for. What a range of expression available for your political voice! Here in Australia, there were so many parties available for the last federal election, that the ballot paper was over a meter long. Yeah, you&#x27;re right, Australia has such a limited freedom of expression, because one book on euthanasia was banned in the past 20 years. That single point completely trumps all other freedoms a country has, and means that there is a <i>vast</i> gulf in comparison to the US.<p>Get over your puritanical idealism and have a look at how things are actually run - this is what affects peoples&#x27; lives, not the nominal principle they say they adhere to. There are plenty of avowed christians who behave in a very non-christian manner, for example.

There&#x27;s just one. For the company. Not one for me, for the company. My company has a _single_ CC covering travel expenses (and god knows what). So someone (travel agency, customer, me, who ever) is booking a hotel. My company sends a polite letter to the hotel, stating that it would cover my stay (see above, limitations etc) and offers the CC details or - still quite often the case - asks even to receive the bill by mail.<p>The hotel has no CC that I gave it, ever. Not mine, not a CC that the company gave me (I .. don&#x27;t have something like that, doubt that it exists in this company outside of maybe some people in the higher sales ranks and .. well .. maybe the US? No clue). The name on the CC used for these things is actually my CEO, last time I checked.<p>Hackable: Well, the whole thread is about abuse, but I think you&#x27;re caught up in that misunderstanding: I&#x27;m not providing a CC and forge a letter that says &#x27;Yeah, but please just charge the room&#x27;. I&#x27;d have to forge a letter that says &#x27;Please charge the room to the following CC&#x27;..<p>That said.. Again: Often enough we ask for a bill. In that case we tell the hotel: &quot;Please send the bill for the stay (room/breakfast...) to company name, street, city&quot;. Is that hackable? Probably.

In the best interests of the company of course, but with a direct emphasis on making customers happy.<p>What&#x27;s important to note is that T-Mobile is quickly becoming a company that delivers a great product and is customer-centric. And when the incumbents start playing catch up (AT&T in particular) you know they&#x27;re making the right moves.<p>I&#x27;ve been with Verizon for a few years and I can&#x27;t say their service is what it&#x27;s marketed to be. Data is fast but the inability to simultaneously do data and voice is just idiotic. The monthly fees are also totally insane. I pay $140 / month for a single data line (iPhone). In contrast to Verizon, with T-Mobile you get unlimited voice and data for a little over $70, no contract and stellar customer service. I called T-Mobile to switch last month and with a little negotiating, they sent me a _free_ iPhone 5S. No contract. No bullshit.<p>T-Mobile&#x27;s latest announcement of up to $650 in credits for switching over will increase their subscriber base by millions of new users, no question. It&#x27;s bold, aggressive and customer-centric.<p>I can&#x27;t personally speak on AT&T&#x27;s network but we all know it&#x27;s one of the worst companies in the world to deal with. Their service is spotty for many, many users. Their customer service is non-existent. Their data practices are borderline unethical (with hidden data caps, throttling, etc). AT&T is just an awful company. I&#x27;m stuck with their uVerse Internet service and it&#x27;s just a disaster. Unfortunately, many of us have no other choice but their lousy broadband product. Let&#x27;s not even talk about Time Warner.<p>T-Mobile&#x27;s coverage, from what I have experienced, is stellar. Up and down the California coast. Mexico. Europe. NYC. Seattle. I&#x27;m always at 4+ bars. Data is fast (~18Mbps downstream). International roaming is perhaps one of the most impressive features of TMO. I remember paying $20 / MB with Verizon and that&#x27;s just absolutely criminal. And they can get away with it because many customers aren&#x27;t even aware of this until they get the bill.<p>Legere is right - the mobile landscape is just horrendous and it&#x27;s mainly because of AT&T and Verizon.

Pipelining works great in Firefox, Opera, Android Browser, but Google has only ever tested with Chrome.

Google never went back once Chrome (kind of) supported pipelining.<p>Microsoft <i>actually tested</i> pipelining and found with it that HTTP was basically equivalent to SPDY in performance.  Read the paper.  And with an unoptimized pipelining implementation.<p>The page you link to provides a lot of hand waiving like about incompatibilities, but this is actually completely beside the point of whether the complication in SPDY actually improves anything.  If you come up with a new protocol just to overcome bad proxies you can just as well have HTTP/1.2 that is exactly the same as HTTP/1.1 except pipelining works; incompatible proxies will only support HTTP/1.1 and the browser can disable pipelining (or some similar solution).<p>EDIT: apparently the main SPDY guy is older than I thought.

To illustrate my point, the clearest example (and the only large one) is the free distributions of BSD, mainly used by companies developing proprietary forks for it and contributing back very little. On the other side is Linux, used by companies for its freedom, security and reliability. The companies using it contribute back <i>because they have to</i>, continually making it stronger and always remaining free (unlike BSD, which can have many proprietary and untrusted libraries which cannot be used with security or reliability in mind).

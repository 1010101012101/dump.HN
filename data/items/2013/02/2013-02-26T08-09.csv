I would also like to add that the type of product being ""manufactured"" adds to the general direction of how a company is being run. If a company is full of people that understand enough of the business to shape future requirements, my belief is that, they tend to gain more from self organizing than companies that only have a subset of people with enough domain knowledge. If you have a very narrow and deep domain and 1/10 employees that really understand enough to be able to shape future backlogs, then having everyone self organize will not really solve the bottle neck that is those people.",1361868986

Suppose I have a storefront, and I keep the doors unlocked, but I put a small sign on the door saying you can't enter unless I've issued you a membership card. Should it be a crime to enter without one? Probably not. Now let's say I get a card reader-based lock, so you can't enter without a card. Even if the lock is easily bypassed (let's say I've left a window open), isn't it reasonable to consider it a crime to do so?",1361868800

5284612,comment,5284111,5284347,10,0,NamTaf,,,"They mention 300kN in the article, and in the design of trains that isn't a lot at all. For example, the AAR [1] standards require a railway vehicle to take up to 1.8x 1560kN longitudinal force - that is, the force imparted down the length of the train through the couplers in to the body structure - without causing bulk yield [2] of the body material. A second design requirement is for the body structure to take 4450kN 'collision' force without exceeding the ultimate strength of the body structure material.<p>Other design criteria include, for example, crash protection of the driver's cabin if it's a locomotive where the drivers sit at the very front, so that part's often very strong and rigid as it needs to preserve a 'survivability space' for the drivers.<p>For passenger cars, the body structure tends to have a lot of strength against longitudinal loads in order to combat the phenomenon of climbing. That is, in a railway collision with passenger cars, as the vehicles ride in to one another, there is the tendency for one to pop up/down and try to 'ride up/down' on top of/under the one in front. [3]<p>This was demonstrated rather tragically in a particular accident (I can't find its name, sorry) where old wooden passenger vehicles did this. Their comparatively strong underframe simply sliced through the comparatively weak cabins like horizontal blades and caused huge fatalities. This is because old passenger cars used to basically be flat-top wooden vehicles with a cabin placed on top, so the body structure was very strong compared to the weak cabin. Since then, passenger vehicles must be specifically designed not to climb up on one another and do that.<p>So really, in the sense of railway design, 300kN is minimal, especially when placed longitudinally down the length of the vehicle structure. They are far weaker against lateral collision so I guess if you ever want to cause a huge railway accident, hit a train side-on rather than end-on.<p>[1]: Not the standards themselves, as they're not publically available - <a href=""https://www.aar.org/Pages/Home.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aar.org/Pages/Home.aspx</a><p>[2]: By 'bulk yield' I mean yielding over a significant portion of the structure. This is a legacy of the AAR standards originally being targeted towards hand calculations, where you couldn't easily inspect every particular section of every particular beam but rather you calculated it as a whole. With the advent of finite element analysis you can now do that, so it's permissible to see slight yield-levels of stress in certain small parts so long as the overall section as a whole remains under it.<p>[3]: This will give a brief example of anti-climbers on rail vehicles: <a href=""http://www.oleo.co.uk/products/rail/anti-climbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oleo.co.uk/products/rail/anti-climbers</a>",1361867787

The totality of a system matters. Especially in complex systems where the graph of causality is very vague.<p>My hobby is Olympic-style weightlifting. One thing that happens a lot in my sport is cargo-culting whichever country happens to be dominant at the moment.

Results? Very disappointing.<p>The context is wildly different. Bulgarian coaches had a feedstock of hundreds of thousands of lifters. If a lifter was wrecked by the extremely aggressive Bulgarian method, so what? You just replaced him with another lifter, there were plenty more coming up the pipeline. Given that in a larger sample you can find more outliers, mere numbers predicted a large fraction of the Bulgarian success -- and before that the Russian success.<p>Mere numbers today predict the success of China in the lighter divisions; mere numbers in future will predict that China will steadily improve in the heavier divisions as Chinese youth become taller due to westernised diets with more protein and calcium.<p>But the cargo culting has begun. Weightlifters already talk about ""the Chinese System"" as if there was some single, monolithic master plan. There isn't really. There's just a metric shit ton of Chinese weightlifters in the lower leagues and the elite international coaches can pick out the best of the best.<p>For the same reason, New Zealand is rugby superpower, nobody can beat the USA at gridiron, Australia is barred from entering the international Australian Rules Football contest because even our lowliest semi-pros dominate any such match up ...",1361867754

Especially because when it was introduced, it was mostly used for games that were only interesting online anyway.  HL mods, HL2 and mods.  That ""no one I know"" is just anecdata, I admit it.

Even if I agree that the decision is made based on moral conscience for most people rather than economic calculation (which might be the case for sociopaths), there is a rational basis for this. Fundamentally, to make sure that I don't get murdered myself by the murderer later, I better not comply with him, as he is proven to be ruthless.

Claiming that is reasonable to charge people with things they may or may not be thinking of doing but have not actually done because ""It's a fundamental principal in our legal system that intent matters."" just doesn't make sense.

Another possibility is that religion is a response to something that is actually out there.  Primitive societies' interaction with the spirits is usually fear of the spirits and/or trying to control/manipulate the spirits to get what they want which they are unable to provide themselves.  One explanation is that they act out of ignorance.  Another explanation is that they act out of some sort of knowledge that we have written off.<p>Furthermore, religions claim to have a revelation of truth not discoverable by the western, Enlightenment-based assumptions that the world consists of only the physical reality.  There could actually be a spiritual reality, and one of the religions might actually be correct.  For example, I personally think that the Christian worldview that we are all selfish (in opposition to God, who is giving, since he needs nothing) explains a lot of things:  poverty, oppression, why we can't stop fighting among ourselves, why communes fail, among others.<p>Religion might just be made up;  some certainly seem to be.  But, it might also be that some are actually right, and if one of them is right, it might have profound implications on how we live our lives.  For example, if there really is a God who loves us so much that he died so that we could eternally relate to him as a child deeply loved by a father, we do ourselves a disservice by assuming that it is just made up.  Christianity might be wrong, some other truth claim might be right, but until we have established that religions do not reflect reality, we should at least remain open to that possibility.",1361866324

5284533,comment,5282870,5284352,7,0,grey-area,,,"I don't think all of these examples involve embedding strings. Many people assume that they can use any ActiveRecord method, and as long as they don't embed strings, they'll be safe from sqli. Take this first example:<p><pre><code>    Order.calculate(:sum, params[:column]) 
</code></pre>
I've just checked in Rails 3.2.12 and this is still possible, haven't checked against Rails 4.0. If I pass in: <a href=""http://localhost:3000/adverts/1?column=id"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:3000/adverts/1?column=id</a>) FROM users WHERE name = 'Bob' SUM(id;<p>And do a simple sum in the controller:<p><pre><code>    sum = Advert.calculate(:sum, params[:column]) 
    # or 
    sum = Advert.sum(params[:column])
</code></pre>
I get:<p><pre><code>    SELECT SUM(id) FROM users WHERE name = 'Bob' SUM(id) FROM ""adverts"" 

</code></pre>
Which is not good as it is injecting sql - with judicious use of sql comments etc it could probably be made to execute any sql statement (apparently it does on sqlite with this particular test, but it fails in postgresql which I tested with). Other queries work with psql though [deleted example and reported]. I've reported this with a working example of sqli just in case it is an unreported problem.<p>Now the intended use of sum, count etc is to deal with symbols chosen by the programmer, but a naive implementation of say an admin form for summing some record attributes might use a param from a form, and pass that in to the sum method for column name, just as they might use params[:id] with find. I think Rails should deal with that.<p>Also the example given of User.exists? params[:id] is probably commonly used, but vulnerable to manipulation of results at the very least.<p>I'm not the original author of this page (which is already public and probably has been for some time), and am aware this is not an appropriate place to report bugs, but it would be reassuring if the Rails team looked at this link and fixed anything which is dangerous like the usage above.<p>IMHO <i>all</i> rails ActiveRecord methods should guard against sqli as much as possible, not just the commonly used ones, and if they don't currently it needs to be fixed.",1361865706

9153032,comment,9151837,9151837,0,0,WhitneyLand,,,"Angular 2 is having a lot of pushback and challenges, but this may be a positive.<p>First, there have been hard feelings over breaking backward compatibility.  To rub salt in the wound the new syntax doesn&#x27;t seem to buy you much for many basic scenarios.  If you are going to push big breaking changes you need to show big benefits that are easy to understand at a glance.<p>Secondly, the Ember community started small but has been kicking ass for a while now and making many improvements that are compelling to developers.  It&#x27;s a modern framework, but also easier to understand than some competitors like react.<p>I see the Typescript move as a positive because it shows they are at least trying to do what&#x27;s right even when using tech from one of the biggest competitors.  How this played internally at Google to overcome executive knee-jerk/bureaucracy/pettiness I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s a good sign.<p>The community has clearly spoken, and the future of Angular is now riding on how well they absorb and react to the feedback and advances from competing teams.",1425581938

9153023,comment,9151799,9152436,0,0,geofft,,,"That&#x27;s a great link. That clarifies the relationship between the vmkernel and Linux.<p>And I think it&#x27;s closer to how I think vmmon works in Workstation: you load the module, and as part of initialization, it hoists itself as owner of the CPU and stuffs the existing system in a world, creating what Xen would call &quot;dom0&quot;. If I&#x27;m reading you right, it sounds like ESX uses &quot;vmnix&quot; to boot from disk and initialize hardware, and then loads vmkernel in a way that does not link with vmnix at all (unlike Linux module loading), hands over control of the processor to vmkernel, and puts itself in a world.<p>Two things worth noting about how the world has changed since 2007: VMware has made the shell much less extensive in ESXi (which was one of the major changes: ESX was very Red Hat-based, and ESXi&#x27;s UNIX parts are just enough busybox to make things work and the shell is disabled by default), and Linux has been pushing back more on proprietary drivers using in-kernel interfaces (see, like, Nvidia and DMA-BUF).<p>I still think that VMware needs Linux for hardware compatibility. If it&#x27;s at all legal, they&#x27;d be wasting their time implementing support for every last SCSI controller, network card, etc. on their own -- and Linux is far ahead in cases where you need reverse engineering or politicking to get support. I don&#x27;t know how good the BSDs are at this sort of thing; I&#x27;m curious if they&#x27;d solve this problem well enough on server hardware.",1425581887

A very substantial section of the population, 45%+ at last count, not only does not view them as reprehensible, but holds them itself.<p>Eich is obviously of a different opinion vis a vis the harm caused by Prop 8. The question is, if one political fasion can be successfully characterized as &quot;exclusively harmful&quot; by its opponents, is it worth the risk of having your Real Name attached to <i>any</i> political comments?<p>Since we don&#x27;t know now what will one day be considered a &quot;lens of history&quot;-style retrospective, perhaps the most prudent course of action would be to engage in discussion anonymously only. If we believe that one should be able to express political opinions without reprisal, we should deeply value the protection of anonymity.<p>The entire affair recounted in the article shows that if you make the wrong person mad and they have the right friends in the right places, you <i>will</i> face very real consequences merely for expressing a different opinion. In the case of the article, the difference in opinion was whether juvenile jokes like &quot;fork my dongle&quot; are funny. In the case of Eich, the difference in opinion was whether Prop 8 helped or harmed. Who knows what it will be when they come for you?<p>Eich&#x27;s forced resignation is a free speech issue. We can&#x27;t value free expression or free speech if we witch hunt everyone who refuses to recant their contrarian political positions. You&#x27;re pretty OK with this now insofar as you, for whatever reason, happen to agree with Eich&#x27;s shamers, but please be aware there&#x27;s no guarantee that your political opinions will always be in favor. Would you be singing the same tune if you&#x27;d been dragged in front of the McCarthy Committee and/or blacklisted for being &quot;vocally left-wing&quot;?<p>I don&#x27;t want to imply that private entities are not within their rights to choose not to hire someone with whom they disagree politically. They are within their rights to do so, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good behavior. If we value meaningful freedom, we need to take a serious look at our shaming, revisionist political culture and do what we can to curb jumps to hostility, incivility, or shaming.

Should they be placed in prison for holding a &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;exclusively harmful&quot; political position? Is it OK if they oppose it on procedural grounds, i.e., they believe the Civil Rights Act has good ideas implemented incorrectly or  suboptimally? What if they actually reject the modern racial narrative? How do we tell which oppositional arguments are legal and which aren&#x27;t? Will you be publishing a guidebook on this soon so that we can make sure we never get caught on the wrong end of the &quot;lens of history&quot; (which, by the way, for any meaningful value of history, <i>can&#x27;t</i> be viewed in the lifetime of the author)?

I can&#x27;t immediately find it, but one of the most depressing things I ever read was some proceedings from a government review of copyright here in the UK prior to the recent legislation that finally added various new statutory exceptions.<p>It consisted of a bunch of unelected people with power to legislate (members of the House of Lords), many of whom declared an interest as people with ties to Big Media one way or another, cross-examining IIRC a senior civil servant whose department were making formal recommendations about the new rules, who stated bluntly that his primary interest was &quot;UK PLC&quot;.<p>The general tone of the entire hearing was that <i>obviously</i> any changes to copyright law should make sure big business still gets its money one way or another, and the only interesting question was how.<p>The idea that copyright might simply no longer be a reasonable model for the digital age and some other economic model might be more effective didn&#x27;t seem to occur to anyone.<p>The idea that copyright might inherently cause harm in terms of the public being able to enjoy works they had already paid for, and that any such harm should therefore be outweighed by some greater benefit for the existence of copyright in law to be ethical and justified at all, was mentioned briefly by I think one or two speakers right at the end of the discussion. They received the parliamentary version of a five-year-old being patted on the head and told how adorable they are. And this was in a debate <i>specifically about</i> new rules to allow people who had obtained lawful copies of a work to enjoy them in perfectly reasonable ways -- indeed, ways millions of UK citizens enjoy every day already, often blissfully unaware that they are even breaking the law, because the idea that what they are doing might not be completely reasonable and could possibly be against the law doesn&#x27;t even occur to them.<p>I have seen plenty of evidence of governments pandering to special interests.

When we do major upgrades (about every 2 years), it takes one of us about a week to source the hardware, get it loaded in to the rack, and turned on.

Very few languages support creating good abstractions, unfortunately.<p>Abstraction lessens complexity, and also adds complexity.<p>Take monads in Haskell, for instance.  Let&#x27;s oversimplify and say that absolutely everything is done through monads.  Great; we&#x27;ve now wrapped up many different things into one thing that&#x27;s easy to reason about.  And when I want to do something, I don&#x27;t have to think at all - I just reach for a monad.<p>And <i>then</i> I have to think, because now I have to figure out how to make a monad do the specific thing that I actually want it to do.<p>Or I&#x27;m reading the code, and yes, that&#x27;s a monad, because it always is, because everything&#x27;s done through monads.  But what is <i>this</i> monad at <i>this</i> location in the code actually doing?  Well, I have to work my way back out of abstraction to concrete in order to understand that.<p>One way to think about this is abstract art.  As art gets more and more abstract, at first I can&#x27;t tell whether I&#x27;m looking at a blonde or a brunette.  Then I can&#x27;t tell whether I&#x27;m looking at a male or a female.  Then I can&#x27;t tell whether I&#x27;m looking at a human or a chair.  And finally, I get to the point where I&#x27;m looking at a painting that <i>could be</i> anything, but it&#x27;s impossible to say what it <i>is</i>.  Abstraction has proceeded to the point that communication (between the artist and the viewer) has been lost.  In the same way, abstraction in code can proceed to the point where communication between the author and reader is lost, and then it takes a lot of work to wade through the layers of abstraction to find out what the code is actually doing.",1425581423

Many companies do participate in open source, but it&#x27;s hard to notice all the activity since there is just way too much going on in so many communities.  What does surprise me is when senior tech people tell me their companies don&#x27;t participate in Open Source since it is almost always the case that they do, but do it &quot;under the radar.&quot; IMO it&#x27;s important for senior tech folks to recognize and support the activity. After all, but embracing it, they can ensure that it is operating in ways that advance the company&#x27;s goals.",1425581181

9152915,comment,9151263,9151855,0,0,brownbat,,,"It&#x27;s ok for a good to be copyable.<p>A good can be &quot;nonrivalrous&quot; and still be a good:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)</a><p>Lemon mint might be another example. It has a pleasant taste and smell, so you might want it as an herb. It&#x27;s also very, very aggressive. Once you have a little, you can--and will if not careful--have more than anyone would ever need in a very short amount of time.<p>Excludability is another interesting property of goods:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability</a><p>An incredibly deep water table provides a source of water that could be considered both nonrivalrous and nonexcludable. Your digging a well doesn&#x27;t prevent anyone else from digging a well and drawing water. If you have the only well making technology, though, access to the water table is &quot;excludable,&quot; ie, you can charge people for access to your well.<p>DRM is usually an attempt to take a nonrivalrous, nonexcludable good and turn it into a nonrivalrous, excludable good.<p>That&#x27;s the best case for producers, since it means they can charge everyone for each new copy, but marginal cost is zero. That is, each new copy costs them nothing to make. So after the first few sales, every purchase is 100% profit.<p>Calling e-books services in this case affects their tax rate, but probably also affects a bundle of consumer rights that are highly specific to the EU and fairly complex.<p>We tend to thing of goods as tangible things, and services as when we make someone spend some time to produce some change (paint a house, fix our hair).<p>Nothing is inherently a good or service though, so that&#x27;s really a bit of oversimplification. Hiring a painter? You&#x27;re actually paying for the paint as well as the work. Buying from a restaurant? You&#x27;re paying for waitstaff as well as food. A freelance journalist? Seems like providing a service when tasked to report on a certain story. A magazine at a drugstore? That seems really good-like. All of this blends together in messy ways, and it&#x27;s easy to get wrapped up too much in the significance of a distinction that&#x27;s mostly historical convention.<p>Well, except that it&#x27;s not mere convention once you realize that legal systems around the world treat this as a very important distinction, and vary in how they treat each category in bizarre and unpredictable ways. VAT is one. Why should taxes on booksellers be high but taxes on bookbinders be low? Trade and immigration is another. Why can people pay for a rake from Tanzania but not a Swiss gardener? Warranties and remedies in contract disputes and commercial law are filled with nutty discrepancies.<p>Each one of these has some historical reason, I&#x27;m not saying we should just treat everything like a good, that probably wouldn&#x27;t work. But it&#x27;s important to realize that no one could guess all these rules in advance from first principles.<p>So if you&#x27;re sitting down and thinking, &quot;what&#x27;s the best set of policies for e-books?&quot; The answer you want is probably not as simple as, &quot;We should just treat them like goods&quot; or &quot;We should just treat them like services.&quot;<p>Nor does it make sense to make up a whole body of law from scratch to deal with every funny new case. There&#x27;s really no easy answer, that&#x27;s why the law evolves really slowly to deal with new technology.",1425581163

--------------------------------<p>Seth started GITenberg back in September of 2012. It was pretty much a one person effort. Through this mailing list, a few other people started thinking about what it could be. I discovered the project and joined up in March of 2014 when I was exploring similar ideas. The project got some good exposure on Hacker News last August.<p>### Knight Foundation Grant
When I heard about the Knight News Challenge for Libraries, I suggested to Seth that GITenberg might be a good fit. Together with Raymond Yee, Seth and I put together a proposal. We got help from Jenny Lee, Phoebe Espiritu, and Emily Nimsakont.<p><a href=""https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/libraries/feedback/gitenberg-modern-maintenance-infrastructure-for-our-literary-heritage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/libraries/feedback/g...</a><p>There were 676 entrants in the News Challenge, and believe it or not, GITenberg was one of 22 entries to receive funding. We&#x27;ve been awarded a $35,000 &quot;Prototype Grant&quot;, which will allow us to spend some real development time to start turning the idea into something that really works. More to the point, we have a deadline (in late June!) for demonstrating the GITenberg concept.<p>Now the work begins.<p>### Next Steps<p>Aside from 45,000+ repos on GitHub (a significant achievement by itself) GITenberg has so far been more concept than reality. If you tried to adopt a repo and submitted a pull request, you&#x27;ll surely be aware that the GITenberg of today is more of a sketch than a working system. To make it a working system, we&#x27;ll have to assemble a lot of cooperating components. Thankfully most of the components we need exist, and people are working on them. This became very clear at the Hack day sponsored by New York Public Library in January.<p>So I think it&#x27;s important to make that sketch more explicit.<p>### Core Vision<p>The core vision is that for any text in Project Gutenberg, anyone will be able to fork a repo, commit a change, and GITenberg machinery triggered by the commit will derive ebook files and metadata products. The commit can be submitted as a pull request, and accepted PRs will get fed back into Project Gutenberg. We hope.<p>At this point, I should comment about Project Gutenberg. To fulfill its mission, Project Gutenberg has to be very conservative in its processes and operations. It doesn&#x27;t have the resources to engage in speculative projects. So while the Project Gutenberg is enabling the experimentation we&#x27;re doing, (and happy that we&#x27;re doing it) we expect that GITenberg will need to prove itself before the PG feedback is a real thing.<p>One thing that Project Gutenberg has been thinking about for years is the source format for its texts. For a good while, that format was 7 bit ascii text files, and there was a lot of resistance to migrating to anything more &quot;modern&quot;. Now, the plain text you get from Project Gutenberg is utf-8. Sort of. The html files are maintained separately, and are not uniform; there&#x27;s a lot of hand-coding. Changing the source format to RST, XML or TEI has been discussed. The PG ebook files (MOBI and EPUB) are built using a script called ebookmaker which digests the html files. The HTML files are thus the &quot;source&quot; files as far as the ebooks are concerned. It should be possible for us to duplicate this workflow in the GITenberg machinery.<p>On the metadata side the situation is more obscure, and we&#x27;re still working to understand it. There&#x27;s a set of RDF files, there are metadata records associated with each ebook folder.<p>### Book Formats<p>We&#x27;ve surveyed the components now available, and we feel that we can also improve on the existing workflow by migrating away from HTML as a source format. At this point, asciidoc appears to be the best fit for a format that can be a source format for the required product files, while at the same time fitting with the established PG text corpus and the Git-based version control. It looks like the best choice for ebook and web formats is the HTMLBook flavor of HTML5. <a href=""http://oreillymedia.github.io/HTMLBook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreillymedia.github.io/HTMLBook/</a> There’s a converter for asciidoc that makes htmlbook files. <a href=""https://github.com/oreillymedia/asciidoctor-htmlbook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/oreillymedia/asciidoctor-htmlbook</a> and css themes that support htmlbook. We expect that alternate paths into HTMLBook can be developed (or already exist) for LaTeX and TEI source formats. Pandoc has done quite a lot.<p>Internet Archive seems like the best destination for GITenberg produced ebook files.<p>NYPL Labs has done some really nice work on generating covers for PG texts, we expect to integrate that work as well.<p>On the metadata side, we&#x27;ve started looking at YAML as an appropriate serialization for PG-associated metadata. conversion to MARC and other formats should be straightforward in the backend.<p>### Issues<p>Github itself has presented us with a set of challenges to address. The large number of repos in the GITenberg organization breaks some Github tools. For example, GitHub for Mac became unstable for me, and some 3rd party integrations would time out when we tried enabling them. We broke our Github pages. So we need to understand this better; Github support has been very responsive. There&#x27;s a separate organization &quot;gitenberg-dev&quot; <a href=""https://github.com/gitenberg-dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitenberg-dev</a> that we&#x27;re using to let us easily work on code untill we fully understand how to work with 50,000 repos; at this point, you probably don’t want to be a member of the Gitenberg organization but you might want to join gitenberg-dev, even if you’re not a developer.<p>The non-programmer usability of Github is another problem. We&#x27;re going to set up a &quot;github for poets&quot; sandbox to see if this challenge can be addressed.<p>Despite the Knight grant, and the efforts of some committed volunteers, this is still a very small effort. GITenberg can&#x27;t succeed without a lot of help, cooperation, and collaboration. I hope everyone on this list will be help us nurture that success.<p>Here’s something each of us can do to get the ball rolling: Decide on a Gitenberg repo to contribute to. Star it in Github. Then add it to the list of active repos at <a href=""https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/wiki/blob/master/activerepos.csv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/wiki/blob/master/activerepo...</a>
(send a PR or create an issue <a href=""https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/wiki/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/wiki/issues</a> )<p>If you’re new to Github, instructions are at <a href=""https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/wiki/blob/add_how_to/how_to.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitenberg-dev/wiki/blob/add_how_to/how_to...</a><p>There&#x27;s a huge amount that we don&#x27;t know, and so much prior work we&#x27;ve yet to absorb but we&#x27;re really encouraged by all the expressions of support we&#x27;ve received. Thank you all!",1425580826

I have a domain with some interesting rewrites to the address that I forward to GMail.  I put together my set up into a Docker container:<p><a href=""https://github.com/jbeda/docker-postfix-forwarder"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jbeda/docker-postfix-forwarder</a><p>It is worth breaking this down into each direction -- sending and receiving.<p><i></i> Sending<i></i><p>This is the easy side. You simply run an SMTP server and have GMail use this to send.  If you want others to not mark you as spam you&#x27;ll want to look at setting up SPF (publishing which IPs are allowed to send from your domain) and perhaps DKIM (digitally sign your email).<p>GMail used to allow sending from aliases directly without an external SMTP server but that is disabled.  Old accounts are grandfathered in.<p><i></i> Receiving <i></i><p>This is where things get complicated.  Essentially, you are having folks send mail to your server and you are turning around and relaying that email to GMail.  GMail has a hard job here.  It doesn&#x27;t know if it should trust you and that you are acting on behalf of the user or if you are an open relay sending spam.  I&#x27;ve found after I change my forwarding set up I have to police my spam folder for a couple of days to retrain GMail.<p>The real complication here is SPF.  Sending domains will publish their own SPF records.  When doing this they can either specify a soft or hard fail.  If they specify a soft fail (`~all`) then there is a chance that GMail won&#x27;t mark it as spam.  But if they use soft fail (`-all`) then it will go to spam all the time.  The problem is that the sending domain (say evite.com) doesn&#x27;t list your relay IP as having permission to send that mail and so GMail respects that.<p>Having GMail <i></i>pull<i></i> the mail via POP is one solution here but that introduces latency.<p>Or you can rewrite the &quot;envelope sender&quot; so that you are honest about the mail coming through your server.  The accepted scheme to do this is SRS.  This is not a silver bullet though.  If you are forwarding a lot of spam, GMail may decide that your SRS domain is spammy and penalize all incoming mail.<p>Also, if you are forwarding a lot of spam, GMail will throttle you.  It&#x27;ll have you back off and wait to forward more mail.  Your best bet is to find ways to eliminate obvious spam before you forward to GMail.<p>My solution seems to be working okay for now, but it is a pain the ass and I&#x27;m honestly not sure it is worth it.<p>EDIT: Here is a tutorial that I used to inform my approach.  It is worth digging in to.  <a href=""http://seasonofcode.com/posts/setting-up-dkim-and-srs-in-postfix.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seasonofcode.com/posts/setting-up-dkim-and-srs-in-pos...</a>",1425580092

Does vmkernel effectively do the same thing Xen does even though it loads dynamically via the kernel module interface <i>after</i> the Linux kernel boots?<p>I don&#x27;t know much at all about how each of these common hypervisors (vmkernel, KVM, Xen, Hyper-V) interact with their &quot;driver domain&quot;, and certainly I&#x27;m in no position to say whether any technical distinction in the way they each load or work will matter legally, but I&#x27;ve been interested in the vmkernel situation for a <i>long</i> time so I&#x27;ll be watching closely.<p>I&#x27;m also reminded that there seem to be several proprietary versions of Xen&#x27;s (otherwise GPL&#x27;d) hypervisor that bolt on closed source features, perhaps they&#x27;ll end up in a similar situation as VMWare if this goes badly for them?",1425579594

9152692,comment,9150163,9152029,0,0,mavelikara,,,"In an essay titled &quot;Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language&quot;[1] Brian W. Kernighan wrote:<p><pre><code>  The size of an array is part of its type
  If one declares

     var     arr10 : array [1..10] of integer;
             arr20 : array [1..20] of integer;

  then arr10 and arr20 are arrays of 10 and 20 integers
  respectively. Suppose we want to write a procedure &#x27;sort&#x27; to 
  sort an integer array. Because arr10 and arr20 have 
  different types, it is not possible to write a single 
  procedure that will sort them both.

  The place where this affects Software Tools particularly,
  and I think programs in general, is that it makes it 
  difficult indeed to create a library of routines for doing 
  common, general-purpose operations like sorting. 
</code></pre>
People who complain about the lack of generics in Go are making the same argument that Kernighan made against Pascal viz. that it is tedious to write library code in the language.<p>EDIT: Also it is not uncommon for a feature that is deemed essential by some to be thought of as adding too much complexity by others. For example,<p><pre><code>  &quot;I&#x27;ve seen [visual] editors like that, but I don&#x27;t 
  feel a need for them. I don&#x27;t want to see the state 
  of the file when I&#x27;m editing.&quot;
</code></pre>

(all of this is at nanoscale timing.) to my knowledge, nobody&#x27;s really gotten algorithms together to express or emulate this yet, although of course modern DAWs have a lot of interesting options, e.g., extracting the &quot;groove&quot; from one sample and applying it to another.<p>my point basically is that the deeper you get into this, the deeper you discover it goes. traditional musical notation is a graphic DSL full of cruft and stupidity, but it takes a lot of work to cook up some code which can cover everything that DSL covers, and if/when you get there, you just discover endlessly more levels of detail to explore.<p>this is awesome if you want to explore it, but agonizing if you want to get from installing a piece of software to making amazing music with it right away. so anyone who makes a library like this has to balance making it comprehensive against making it easy to get started, and in that sense, it&#x27;s a lot like designing a programming language.",1425579523

And just because her explanations are hand-wavey and not as precise and data-driven as the HN crowd would prefer, that does not prove she is simply self-deluded and full of shit.<p>If people were really criticizing the hand-wavey descriptions, as you claim, they would be making different criticisms from what I have mostly seen here.

I have had to learn to explain it in much more precise terms. And I have had some relatively unusual opportunities to firm up my mental models and make it more data-driven, because the audience I had (my very aspie older son) needed that in order to understand it at all.<p>So, most people with good social radar are not going to be able to readily give the precise, data-driven explanations that the HN crowd values so highly.  But the reason I suspect Jessica is being dismissed based in part on her gender, rather than the hand-wavey nature of her assertions, is because of the framing of the criticism she is getting. As I said earlier, a lot of the comments here do not boil down to &quot;please, show your work and prove you are right.&quot; They boil down &quot;Oh, you are full of shit and no one can know that and, god, my respect for YC just plummeted&quot; as if she had confessed that her method for deciding who to accept involved casting their horoscope or consulting a psychic.<p>When I first joined HN, the top three people here all had about 50k karma and there was a much more collegial environment than currently exists. I was never given access to that collegial environment. I never got a mix of some acknowledgement that I might have a point and some criticism that not everyone agreed with me and the opportunity to state why I thought x, y or z. Instead, men on the leaderboard closed ranks. For a long time, if I said anything, you could bet dollars to donuts that two different people (not the same ones every time) from the leaderboard would chime in to announce how wrong I was.<p>It took me literally years to figure out that this was going on in part because, for a woman, I had a high amount of karma and I was, thus, rocking the boat. Initially, I had no idea because, at the time, my karma was so far off from qualifying for a bottom rung on the leaderboard that I figured I was a Nobody and no one should be noticing me at all. However, I was able to infer (based on that social indicators in the way people reacted to me, in spite of the lack of hard data – in other words, “social radar”) that I was apparently <i>prominent</i> for a woman, in spite of my pathetically low amount of karma. Eventually, I was able to dig up real data proving that fairly firmly (in spite of the limits on the data available to me). Once I understood the position I was in, I was able to quit attracting so much damning attention.<p>So what I am telling you is that a) Hacker News has deteriorated in some ways generally, which has hurt the experience of most members and I would like to see the bar raised such that the collegial environment returns generally and b) I would like women included in that respectful debate of ideas in a way I do not believe they have been previously included. And one way you can help achieve that, if you so desire, is to change the manner in which you criticize women and their &quot;hand-wavey&quot; attempts to express themselves.<p>One thing that would really, really help a whole lot is make damn sure you understand that &quot;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot; In other words, just because women are generally going to not be good at defending their positions on terms that the men here will readily accept does not, by itself, prove they are wrong. Just because the explanation is hand-wavey does not mean she is full of shit. Ask better questions. Encourage women to get the data that backs up their position. If they can&#x27;t immediately do so, genuinely &quot;agree to disagree&quot; instead of pissing on them like they aren&#x27;t worthy of any respect. Give women an opportunity to grow into the ability to communicate in more precise terms and learn to effectively back up their statements. Because shooting them down and pissing on them is not something that will ever help women up their game and learn to go toe-to-toe with the big boys. It merely excludes them.<p>And thank you for reading my blog post and engaging me in good faith.",1425578673

How did you get interested in this market? Someone or something led you down the road this product so follow that road back to see who along the way can help you now.<p>Splurge on a premium LinkedIn account and hunt down contacts in the market. See where they are within your network and seek out introductions.<p>Once you land one or two clients use them to build out. HR and Legal are two very well connected groups of people and they tend to talk among themselves at various networking events and within their circles. Get references and use their connections.<p>Finally, you missed an opportunity here by not linking to your product/service. Even put it in your profile here.

I believe they have both left out en passant, which is rare enough that it won&#x27;t be missed most of the time. It&#x27;s rare enough that if you use it against a casual player, there is a good chance they will accuse you of making it up.<p>Castling, however, which is also omitted, is much more serious. Getting castled is one of the top goals of the opening. It happens in nearly every game. Taking that out is huge.<p>Pawn promotion is missing from the older program but included in the smaller French program (making the French achievement even more impressive). I&#x27;d say that is not as big an omission as castling, because many games end before it gets to that point. Still, the threat of promotion has a major influence on endgame play.<p>So what we actually have are very impressive implementations of chess-like games. That raises the question of what is the smallest implementation of full chess?<p>I suspect that both these programs could be expanded to the full rules without making them a lot bigger, by taking the short cut of allowing the human to make those moves, but not the computer (especially if the computer trusts the human and does not check for legality of the human&#x27;s move).

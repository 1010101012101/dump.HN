Mostly because this feature comes from Ruby and so I'm already used to it<p>This and that are completely orthogonal though, I've been using Python for 8 years and Ruby for 6 so I'm used to implicit scoping. Doesn't mean I like it, or find it a good idea to use it in new languages (I don't).<p>And the issue is actually bigger in coffeescript than in ruby and python both, interestingly because (through javascript) coffeescript's scoping is much more regular than Python's or Ruby's.<p>The only language in which I don't know implicit scoping to be an issue is Erlang, because it uses bind-once and immutable structure semantics.<p>> also because it takes away the nasty surprise that JavaScript gives you if you leave 'var' out.<p>That can trivially be fixed by linting, or using strict mode.

4536588,comment,4534359,4536475,5,0,nessus42,,,"Did you read the part above where I wrote this:<p><pre><code>    It is an irrefutable fact of Special Relativity that if you can transmit any
    information from point A to point B faster than light would travel from point
    A to point B in a vacuum, then there are inertial frames of reference in which
    the information arrived at point B BEFORE it left point A.
</code></pre>
Is there a reason why I can write this irrefutable fact a dozen times and people continue to ignore it like it was never stated?<p>Look, I understand that people want perpetual motion machines. And I understand that people want the Earth to be the center of the universe. And I understand the fact that people want one plus one to equal three. But these things aren't going to happen.<p>With FTL, you have to pick two out of these three: FTL, Relativity, causality.<p>It is not a fact of <i>science</i> that you have to pick two out of the three. It is a fact of LOGIC.<p>Unless you've found a way to transcend the laws of logic, then we have to live within this constraint. So, if you want to have FTL, you either have to give up causality or Special Relativity. Is it conceivable that Special Relativity is wrong? Sure it's <i>conceivable</i>. Is it likely? NOT ON YOUR LIFE. And if you're willing to give up on Special Relativity, when why are we designing space ships based on General Relativity??? When Special Relativity goes out the window, so does GR!<p>So, are we going to give up on causality instead? Well, who am I to say yes or no. But if we decide that it's okay to give up on causality, then we have to bite the bullet and decide that we're okay with us being in a universe that is really, really strange. E.g., one that will thwart you somehow one way or another in any attempt you might make to transmit certain kinds of information, etc. One that might be perfectly okay with letting you visit your past self, and yet will suddenly give you a case of laryngitis if you try to tell your past self which stocks to buy. Who knows how weird it could get!<p>Re your space ship being in a vacuum or not: (1) It's still in a vacuum, and (2) it doesn't matter. What matters is if you can use it to transmit information from say Earth to Mars at a speed faster than a laser beam or radio signal would make it from Earth to Mars.<p>Re galaxies moving away from us at FTL speeds: (1) Yes, galaxies that are very far from us do move away from us at FTL speeds. Can you use this fact to transmit information between two points (e.g. two planets) at FTL speeds? No you cannot! Special Relativity says nothing at all about space itself moving at FTL speeds. It only puts constraints on information traveling from one point to another point at FTL speeds.<p>Go read the irrefutable fact at the top of this post again. Read it over and over again until you understand it. I can't keep repeating it over and over again for it only to fall on willfully deaf ears.",1347947834

4536549,comment,4534359,4536007,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"The link had a really interesting but unsatisfactory explanation, IMO. The way I am understanding it is as follows: Man A and Man B are traveling (with combined speed of 0.866c) away from each other. Because of time dilation, to A it appears that B's clock is twice slower (1/sqrt(1 - 0.866^2) == 2). Then A shoots from some sort of weird space gun whose bullet is instantaneous. The bullet passes B at 4 seconds (relative to B). B notices that and shoots back, and B's bullet, due to equivalent effect hits A at 6 seconds causing a dead grandfather paradox.<p>However what I don't understand is this -- to say that the bullet shot by A passes B at 4 seconds presumes that we are talking about A's frame of reference (because it is from A's point of view that B is 4 seconds ""behind"" -- and likewise A is 4 seconds behind from B's perspective). However, what if, from B's frame of reference, A's bullet actually passes B at 0 seconds?",1347947217

CS has been designed as a pure abstraction of JS, whereas those other projects take full-fledged languages with all of their idoms and features and make JS out of it. I agree that new syntax is a cost, and in general that we should fear abstractions. PyJS seems like it's more of a web framework (as is GWT) rather than a pure language compiler.<p>Python is a beautiful language, but just code in JS if you're working on the front end and are wary of CS. I'm a capable JS developer and it took me almost no time to get started with CS. Sure, you hit snags here and there with oddball situations and sometimes you have to check the output, but the benefits <i>definitely</i> outweigh the learning costs.",1347946412

The problem is structural engineering of a very large negative-pressure-sealed structure in which a fault anywhere could destroy the whole thing.  It would need complex airlocks, which would make each station enormously expensive as well.<p>I would note, however, one of my ideas that may have some synchronicity:  that the speed of sound in a gas rises rapidly as the molecule gets less massive, and the drag force drops as the gas becomes less dense.  Simultaneously, if hydrogen cars are going to get off the ground they need a distribution pipeline system.  A train that traveled in a tube of hydrogen could effectively bypass the 'air' speed of sound and move at at least mach 3 before reaching the H2-transonic range.  Sealing STP hydrogen in a container can be done an order of magnitude easier than sealing vacuum or highly pressurized gas.<p>The ""tracks"", of course, would be some form of maglev.  Ideally, an 'Inductrack' design, which have not been seen in use yet but offer substantial advantages.  On the other hand, given the progess on high-temperature superconductor manufacturing, perhaps those advantages are shrinking.<p>On Googling, it would appear that I'm not the only one to have this notion:

As a Chicagoan and a huge fan of S.F., this pissed me off because of the pure lack of journalistic integrity (and logic for that matter) when putting this article together. The Chicago startup scene pales in comparison to San Francisco, everyone knows that. There is no need to go through some ridiculous and poorly executed comparison to prove it. My comment to his post on the Atlantic (edited for grammar):<p>That is hardly representative of both Chicago and San Francisco's startup scene. I am not sure which is more shocking to me, the fact that you are posting this on the Atlantic (an extremely well respected publication) or the fact that an editor approved this.<p>A. The San Francisco map doesn't even include Menlo Park, Mountain View, etc. The San Francisco startup scene is even larger than you depict. 
B. You don't list the San Francisco startups as you with the Chicago map.  
C. You just Googled the locations of a few well known Chicago startups and just plopped them on the map. Simply taking a few minutes to search you might have found 1871, a startup incubator located in Chicago's Merchandise Mart that is the home to several HUNDRED startups. <a href=""http://www.1871.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.1871.com/about/</a>  
D. The scale on the maps are not comparable. 
E. This is simply unintelligent and a perfect example of the poor journalism we see today.<p>In Short: Thank you for wasting five minutes of my life with your last minute-deadline submission that contributes zero value to society.",1347945182

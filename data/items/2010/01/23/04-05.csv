Right now none of them are competitors, but they might become competitors in the future.<p>I keep on going back and forth between ""any money is good money"" and ""if they're going to end up competing with us, anything we have that they don't have is good"".

But they were probably doing their job very well, within the system they found themselves in.<p>It sounds to me like a large part of fulfillment was outsourced (not so unusual) and there was very little involvement from BN during the ""channel design"" (don't know what you call that, I'm not in the biz) and channel operation. Basically, some vendor was allowed by BN to screw BN and its customers.<p>The VP who denied the $100 gift card was probably staunching a hemorrhage of gift cards.<p>None of this is an excuse.

1071353,comment,1071290,1071290,0,0,patio11,,,"I think the Kindle gives authors a passel of excellent opportunities to bring their business practices kicking and screaming into the 20th century:<p>1)  Amazon offers free samples of most books, where you can get hooked on a chapter and on the last page it has a call to action like: ""Like this?  (linky)Buy the book(/link)""  It is one or two clicks (can't recall) until money has exchanged hands and the book is winding its way down the tubes to your device.  This implementation is genius and they need to do more: for example, EVERY sci-fi/fantasy book needs to have, on the last page, ""The epic tale of heroism, sensuality, and gratuitous buttkicking continues in (linky)Librarian Unchained(/linky)!""<p>2)  Every author should have a blog.  Every author should have an email list.  You should be using both of these to sell or give away things to your fans.  (""Hiya guys!  Happy Valentine's Day!  Since you've been so good to me, I'm giving you a little treat: a free sneak peak at my next novel, and one invitation that you can send to a very special someone."")  It is absolutely insane that I can spend literally hundreds to thousands of dollars on books from one author or publisher and yet nobody at any point tries to capture my details to sell me more of the stuff that <i>I clearly want to buy</i>.<p>3)  Apparently the book industry thinks word of mouth drives most book purchases.  First, that is probably malarky, an old wives' tail which has no basis in empirical fact.  The majority of books are probably sold due to being the event books which receive heavy promotion, go to the top of the lists, and can be picked up or clicked on without being searched for.  (The Kindle -- wonderful device that it is -- SUCKS for searching for books, except by going to the genre stacks and sorting by sales.  It is like it was designed by the same guy who did the App Store.)<p>Instead of using unscientific malarky, they should start actually TRACKING to see who is buying books and why.  People will happily tell you this if you give them a reason to do it: for example, the author who they consider a close person in their lives just asks them to, or they're offered a freebie for their time.  (Amazon is in a much better position to do this than either authors or publishers.  If one player in the market is structurally guaranteed to be the only one with accurate analytics, I think I can pick the winner already.)",1264220614

1071350,comment,1070604,1070950,0,0,jerf,,,"""Isn't the whole point of math that you expect at some point to analyze the result of the symbol manipulation and 'read off' an interpretable meaning from the answer?'<p>Ah, and therein lies the rub. In math terminology, I think that that <i>itself</i> is an axiom, in the sense that you can choose it or not choose it, and it will strongly affect the rest of the system. If you accept the axiom, you end up going down the constructivist path. If you do not, you end up in ""conventional mathematics"" (i.e., what you get for a real math degree in college).<p>Personally, as a programmer I am also sympathetic to the constructivist viewpoint, but I am happy to settle for everyone involved understanding when they've left the physical universe (real numbers, axiom of choice, etc) and when they haven't. If some people want to screw around in the unreal universe, more power to them, doesn't have to bother me. And they often produce useful approximations for real-life use. As RiderOfGiraffes said, there are proofs that work on reals much better than any actual number, and I observe that in practice the resulting maths work out pretty well in the real world, even if they aren't actually physical.<p>(We have <i>way</i> larger problems dealing with floating point, monsters of our own creation, than we do in dealing with the fact that our equations of motion are defined based on real numbers that don't actually correspond to anything, where the inaccuracies are typically beyond our measuring ability and dominated by general inaccuracies of the input data which are far larger than the granularity of the universe.)<p>But I do think maintaining that distinction is definitely important. I further observe that while I can't speak for all of mathematics, the mathematicians are very careful to distinguish what takes the Axiom of Choice and what does not, just to draw one example. They are pretty good about showing their work.<p>I guess the takeaway is that you certainly aren't alone; many people agree that real numbers are ridiculous in the way you are sensing. But they can be a useful fiction.",1264220542

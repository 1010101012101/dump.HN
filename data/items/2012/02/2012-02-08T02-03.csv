3564834,comment,3562137,3564658,2,0,jwhite,,,"If you had enrolled in electrical engineering then by half way through second semester of first year you probably would have been having lots and lots of light bulb moments.  Complex numbers and fourier series and transforms rapidly become like oxygen for EEs.  Essential but consumed almost without noticing.<p>You suffered from the university's lack of bandwidth -- only so many lecturers, only so many lecture theatres, many other competing classes.  They try to find efficiencies where they can -- e.g. by giving all of the engineering departments a common mathematics curriculum.<p>That curriculum is almost certainly driven by the needs of the EEs and ME/CivE's much more than chem and software, and I'd guess software engineering is looked at is if there's really no maths required.  After all, software engineers just program and write documents, don't they?  The truth is of course that there is just as much scope for maths, if not more, in a software engineering or computer science course, it's just a whole other type of maths that's needed.",1328669915

(Indeed, I think in the not too distant future we will be teaching logic using something like an interactive theorem prover. It makes a bit of the formalism quite clearer.) There has been some push, especially in Europe, for using these programs to prove other mathematics; it is certainly possible, although few would say it is pleasant or resembles how ordinary mathematicians work. But I think that, for specific areas of mathematics, these tools are useful <i>today</i>. Especially when trying to teach students how to think formally; you'll find that <i>formal</i> corresponds closely to how the computer thinks about things (and the whole problem is that mathematicians are not very formal at all.)<p>CPDT is not a good first text; Software Foundations <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/</a> does better for people with less math experience.",1328669485

While I have learn most of my knowledge in the university (2 undergrads, 2 masters and finishing a phd) there have been other topics besides CS, mechanical engineering, statistics,... that were interesting to me. Sports and nutrition being the most important, and I have never had any mentor or taking any course on them.<p>In the University the education has to be focused on teaching what is needed, not what an individual wants to learn. I did not like databases, but I took 2 db courses. I did not like compilers but I took 1 course just focused on this topic. And both topics are useful, and somebody working on CS need to know its basics. This cannot (and should not) be decided by an individual sorely based on his interest or needs. A basic layer of knowledge is decided by experts on the field that consider that ANY xxxx (put here whatever career you want) must have.<p>What I felt in the fields I am an autodidact is basically a huge lack of basic knowledge. How am I supposed to decide whether the book A is better than the book B for the topic I am trying to learn? Do I need to know something before getting into this other topic? How I decide the path I need to follow to reach a certain knowledge? Those questions are (almost) always solved with somebody guiding you through the process of learning.<p>There is something that has always shocked me: is that most autodidacts cannot accept that their education might be partial and the lack of base (generalizing here) might affect their adaptation for new projects or their speed on learning new techniques.<p>Following the structure of a university in careers like CS or engineering should be a must, and new methods of education are stepping on the learning process by helping autodidacts to be directed into a clear path of what-is-needed.",1328667995

When you hire an employee, you are purchasing his labour, and we tax that.<p>But if you pay yourself a dividend, there is no transaction.  If you own an asset, and it goes up in value, there is no transaction.  (Capital gains tax is not on the transaction of selling your stock, but on the change in value of the stock; it's only realized at sale.  Some countries do charge a transaction tax on stock sales, usually called a stamp duty, which is entirely different.)<p>More generally, we tax things when they change ownership.  (We even tax things when you give them away!)  In the case of a small business owner, everything in the business is owned by you.  It's yours.  You own the business, the business owns the couch, therefore, <i>you</i> own the couch.  Ownership is inherently transitive.  Even in a large business, everything is owned by the stockholders.  Businesses are not people.  (Note:  At this point, people usually bring up <i>Citizens United</i>, despite the fact that the decision does <i>not</i> claim that businesses are people. Try reading it; it's actually pretty interesting.)<p>Thought experiment:  Can we tax you on the rent you are implicitly paying yourself for living in your own house?  Why or why not?  And if we can't tax you on the value of the rent your house is providing you, why can we tax you on the value of the things your business is providing you?  (Well, obviously, we can do it because the law says we can.  But morally, the difference seems remarkably theoretical.)<p>Further thought experiment:  Should you be taxed if you hire yourself as an employee?  I'm actually torn on this one.  Logically, the answer seems like it should be ""no""; it doesn't matter if you hire yourself as an employee for a salary, or work for ""free"" in exchange for equity.  Intuitively, it feels to me like it's okay to tax an owner on his salary but not his dividends.  <i>shrug</i>  Guess I'm not that logical.  :)<p>2) Yglesias' post is suggestive, but doesn't really prove anything.  As I said, there's a LOT of research on this point, and saying, as he does, ""Germany added a capital gains tax, and their savings rate didn't immediatly change"" does not really tell us as much as he thinks.  Germany has also been noted for extremely low wage growth recently.  Clearly the result of underinvestment caused by their pernicious capital gains tax, right?

But for Objective-C & Cocoa, which is admittedly a somewhat extreme case, autocompletion is a godsend.<p>But autocomplete is only one feature among many I appreciate in a good IDE. I'd also hate to give up a good visual debugger with integrated breakpoints, direct links from compile errors, etc. I know you can hack a lot of this together in Vim or Emacs but after 15 years of doing just that I don't miss it when I'm using IntelliJ or XCode.",1328667257

The ability to schmooze is largely about communicating personal emotions and resonating with others in obvious ways.  You acknowledge their feelings, regardless of how trivial it is, and now you're connected.  But I've seen some people use this in very bad ways.  Almost in predatory ways.<p>However, despite how much I hate being forced to schmooze with someone (say on an impromptu conference call) or be able to talk about nonsensical things in a clever funny way when meeting a new girl or being out in social situations, I resigned myself that what I really hate is being UNPREPARED.<p>So for me Toastmasters, learning simple comedy routines, exercising, dressing nice, knowing current events and some pop culture, recent sports news; all give me confidence to speak smoothly, conversate well etc etc.  I'm more referencing dating and meeting people than office situations but it's all the same thing -- getting people to like and notice you.<p>So prepare and improve yourself how you can.  And if you are okay labeling yourself an introvert then learn to play the guitar and take dance classes.  No words needed with those but they will tremendously help your social life.",1328666576

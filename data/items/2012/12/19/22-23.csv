4945279,comment,4943724,4944108,15,0,pron,,,"I would recommend reading ""Sex on Six Legs: Lessons on Life, Love, and Language from the Insect World"" by Marlene Zuk. It's a truly wonderful book about insects (and spiders too), about their evolution, and about how little brain power is required to display complex behavior.<p>Here are a few of my favorite, more on the philosophical side, quotes from the book:<p><pre><code>    Insects bring home the uneasy truth that you don't need a big brain to do big \n    things, and that in turn makes us question how the mind and, dare to say it, \n    the spirit, are related to the brain. It even makes us question what it means \n    to be human. What does it mean to have complex behavior? Does it mean you are \n    smart?\n\n\n    Natural selection can produce what looks uncannily like intelligent thought or\n    emotion but is no more than the relentless culling of minute variations in genetic\n    makeup, generation after generation, for millions of years. Not only that, but\n    insects too have small personalities, with some showing boldness in new situations\n    and some hanging back with what looks an awful lot like shyness. It's turning out \n    that we haven't cornered the market on individuality, either.\n\n\n    Insects are starting to answer the question of ""What does it take?""to have a\n    personality, to learn, to teach others, to change the world around themwith the\n    humbling and perplexing answer, ""Not much."" Humbling because they do these things\n    with brains the size of a pinhead, and perplexing because if that's all it takes, \n    what does that mean for us, with our gigantic forebrains and exhaustingly long\n    periods of childhood dependency?</code></pre>",1355957728

They seem to take a stance of ""unless it is blatant crap, grant it, and let the courts sort it out and/or wait for enough complaints"".<p>I think its just a matter of man power, they don't seem to be able to dedicate the time/talent up front to do a thorough job.  Instead they make a bet that most patents are meaningless anyway so grant liberally and only put in the real time when/if a patent becomes an issue.<p>The problem with this is that it strikes a firm blow to one of the key goals of the patent system, to protect the 'little guy'.  Making a patent a big enough issue to draw review is prohibitively expensive for most little guys.

4945192,comment,4944073,4944073,1,0,aorshan,,,"As a Marketing student who has worked in a few different marketing jobs I think there are a couple things you should be looking for.<p>First, as previously mentioned, please do not make your decision based on the individual's social media followers. Instead, you might want to look at some of the growth they've helped to engineer in their previous jobs. For example if they tell you that they helped a company grow from 500 to 50,000 twitter followers, that is pretty impressive. However, even then it is important to take those numbers with a grain of salt. Ask how many were purchased vs earned. Ask what specific techniques they used to gain those followers and how they would apply those techniques to your company. Try to determine how much impact that specific person had on the growth.<p>Second, just like many people suggest assigning a coding project to a candidate to determine if they fit with the company's engineering style, you can assign a project to a marketing candidate to see if the work they do fits with what you're looking for. Ask them to write a sample blog post for you. Ask them to write a sample email they would send to potential customers. Ask them to outline some ideas they have for how to market your company and how they would implement them.<p>Third, if you want to attract good marketers, please don't treat them like second class citizens. There is a large resentment among many in the tech community towards ""Business"" people and ""Marketers"". If you and your company show similar resentments, the person you are interviewing will be turned off.",1355956328

To thwart precomputation attacks, e.g., ""rainbow tables"".<p>Modern password cracking has all-but obsoleted both of these reasons.

It's not simply an affirmation of the primacy of unconditional love, but also an explicit rejection of any other spiritual motive. I haven't read Ecclesiastes, but from your depiction, it only partially addresses the first part of the piece. ""Making the most of your day"" neither says anything about what positively constitutes ""most"" (to the author, ""most"" is the result of acting with unconditional love), nor what negatively constitutes ""most"" (killing for God, etc).<p>Indeed it's important to remember to make the most of your day, but for the author, it's equally important to frame impulses that disregard unconditional love as wrong.

4945106,comment,4943969,4944744,9,0,Udo,,,"You are correct to doubt the meaning of these words as they are being flung around for the sole reason of providing credibility. Your mistake is coming with scientific thoughts into a discussion that is utterly non-scientific and purely based on making money with buzzword-laden books by turning anything related to food into a weird cult-like experience.<p>But at least your questions are in an area where I can maybe help out. Carbohydrates are just what the name says: carbon molecules with hydrogen and oxygen attached to them. Complexity of carbohydrates is a spectrum, with formaldehyde being at one end and ultra-complex molecules such as huge amino-saccharides or polymers on the other. Saccharides are sugars, who all belong to the carbohydrate family. As far as nutrition is concerned, most sugars are based on the glucose molecule, that's a unit with 6 carbon atoms typically wound into a ring with six or five edges. Chaining those rings together makes polysaccharides.<p>Overly long saccharide chains only fit into our sweetness taste detectors at one point, that's one ping each from a huge number of saccharide rings. Smaller sugars (like dextrose) cause a lot more signal by fitting better into the detectors, that's why they tend to taste sweeter. Polysaccharide disassembly starts with enzymes in the saliva of the mouth, that's why some things get sweeter when you chew on them for a while. For people who don't gobble down their food to quickly, that means only small sugar molecules even arrive in the small intestine, where they are further split into monosaccharides which can finally be resorbed through the intestinal wall. The small intestine is ill-equipped to handle longer chains, though, that's why they pass into the large intestine. In itself that's not a problem, but if there is a _regular and large_ amount of this stuff in the large intestine, it will attract microbes that live off it.<p>So if a lot of sugars regularly make it into the large intestine, chances are there will be a population of bacteria (or worse: funghi) taking advantage of that. It's not like the bacteria <i>cause</i> obesity as some articles suggest, their presence is itself a symptom of a nutritional problem (such as too much intake). Of course sometimes these colonies cause other problems like inflammatory reactions that eventually necessitate flushing them out. But saying those bacteria <i>cause</i> obesity is just the new ""I'm not fat, I'm big boned"", a mechanism designed to deflect the responsibility for obesity away from a person's behavior.<p>The digestive system is designed to survive and thrive on a variety of food, but there is also a lot that can go wrong. It's not ""evil complex polysaccharides"" wreaking havoc and producing energy out of thin air to make people fat, it's (as always) people eating too much who are bringing this upon themselves.<p>One good thing food cults such as the different ""nutrition plans"" and ""strategies"" can do, however, is making people reflect on their habits and generally lower their energy consumption. To make it extra clear: I don't think vegetarianism is one of these cults, but it too causes people to eat more carefully.",1355954893

It's a very hard case to win--the town has already given up a lot of arguments by having waited too long (believing that the government would protect them), and the other side has a ton of money. But being hard doesn't mean it isn't meritorious. This is a suit that needs to be brought and deserves to be brought, but never would in a loser-pays system. And maybe that would be okay in Europe, where they pay for a big government to enforce these sorts of things, but we don't do that in the U.S. Instead, we depend on private litigation to enforce peoples' rights.",1355954620

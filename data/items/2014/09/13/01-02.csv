8311371,comment,8309375,8309375,2,0,tatterdemalion,,,"Borges is really one of the most important fiction writers of all time. Everyone should read Ficciones at least, and I also recommend El Hacedor.<p>I think several commenters here are significantly off on equating the Library of Babel with information technology. This is a limiting interpretation. Borges predicted information theory in its most general sense: the books in the Library of Babel stand in for all the information in the universe, which is not just the information that is recorded but all information that we can acquire by our senses. Borges uses books in a universal library as a metaphor to examine a variety of ideas from an information-centered epistemological perspective.<p>And at the same time that he prefigured the scientific discourse of information theory, he also prefigured much of what is valuable in late twentieth century sociology. (Stuart Hall&#x27;s Encoding/Decoding comes especially to mind.) The line in The Library of Babel that stands out most to me is this one: <i>A number n of the possible languages employ the same vocabulary ... You who read me - are you certain you understand my language?</i>",1410572399

I had a significant deficiency in vitamin D, B12 and Iron. After taking supplements for 3 months they all returned close to  recommended levels. One difference may be the specific bio availability of the supplements I take.<p>The Vitamin D is D3 (it is an oil filled gelcap) which increases your body&#x27;s ability to absorb it. The powdered Vitamin D is supposedly worthless. I take 50,000 IU twice a week, most pills you buy from the store are 250 to 1000 IU, although you can find 5,000 IU.<p>The B12 is a sublingual tablet which increases bioavailability, but unsure how much better it is supposed to be compared to what you&#x27;d normally find in a multi vitamin.<p>Lastly, the Iron supplement - Feosol with Bifera has two kinds of iron (HIP and PIC) which minimizes side effects and increases bio availability.<p>I started taking bifera before the other two and the increase in my energy levels after a week or two was really quite remarkable.<p>As other people have stated, this is something you should probably talk with your doctor about, but try to be as informed as possible when you do.",1410572393

There&#x27;s a bigger issue here than the mistaken belief that she&#x27;s not an expert on this subject.<p>If the drive for credentialism means that we don&#x27;t allow smart statisticians to review existing literature, then we&#x27;ve failed at whatever we&#x27;re trying to achieve.<p>I think I understand the drive for expert-only opinions. We&#x27;ve probably all been disappointed by misinformed scientific discussions, probably on some policy issue. Excluding opinions from random people on the street yields more productive discussions.<p>After random people on the street, we might also exclude people in positions of irrelevant authority, like religious or political leaders. We might continue to exclude voices right up until we&#x27;re just left with those who have actually conducted some research directly on topic.<p>There comes a point, though, where by narrowing the field of voices you listen to, you&#x27;re actually lowering the signal/noise ratio rather than upping it.<p>In fact, if you can only talk to one person about scientific consensus, absolutely do not ask a scientist in that field. One researcher out of a field full of contentious debates is a terrible sample!<p>If you can only talk to one person, start with a smart statistician who engages in lit reviews or meta-analysis. That way you have one conversation, but sample a much greater percentage of the field, and you get to hear it from someone who has some distance from the interpersonal debates going on in that  narrow corner of academia.<p>If you can only talk to one person about a topic, talk to someone like Emily Oster.",1410572293

So if your &quot;being the kind of person who takes vitamins&quot; means that you eat an extremely balanced diet that covers all your macros, then you are good, but most people do not eat enough of the right foods.<p>In addition, there are tons of substances that your body can synthesize itself, but would love more of it. Creatine for example can be made in the liver and kidney from L-arginine, glycine, and L-methioninein, but it takes work for your body to do it. It is much more efficient (something like 20X) to just take a creatine supplement and bring it to levels that will allow your body to maximize it&#x27;s production of the energy molecule ATP (by resupplying a phosphate molecule).",1410570525

When it comes to really novel technology, it can take tremendous investment just to get a technology to the level of viability.<p>My point isn&#x27;t that every new technology requires a monopolistic environment. My point is that monopolies (or oligopolies) are particularly good at developing really fundamental new inventions, while competitive markets excel more in making better variants of well-understood technologies. Blu-Ray and HD-DVD were competing optical disc formats, but the original CD was actually a joint-venture by audio giants Sony and Panasonic.<p>I think a great example is the work Google is doing in self-driving cars. It can afford this sort of blue-sky R&D because of the massive profits thrown off by its advertising business. One day the technology will be mature and you&#x27;ll see companies compete to refine it and make variations of it, but it will have been Google, using the profits from its near-monopoly on search, that will have done the really fundamental work.",1410570011

7479583,comment,7475869,7475869,3,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"I would have to say that the problems in academic science go deeper than &quot;PhD union cards&quot;, but they&#x27;re certainly rooted in the same academic-familial-reproductive structure as the PhD issue.<p>Academia does a breadth-first heuristic search on possible research, slowly converting the search space of potential ideas into published papers.  If you want to work in the research system, you get slotted into a specialty and an education largely just according to what your grad-school and postdoc supervisors already work on.  Hence why I&#x27;m calling it a breadth-first search: new scientists are almost literally additional nodes in a search tree.<p>The problem is the heuristic that governs where the tree is expanded (and how quickly): publication numbers and grant funding (which is determined by publication numbers).  From the personal perspective there&#x27;s also the sheer coincidence of which research fields and which advisers you&#x27;ve <i>heard of at all</i> when you finish your BSc or MSc and apply to your postgraduate research degree -- which is governed by grant funding and publication numbers.<p>Thing being... not only is a tree-shaped expansion structure generating untenable job markets, but the expansion heuristic in question doesn&#x27;t really correspond to what we want out of scientific research.  There are three main reasons to prioritize one research proposal over another: we think it will be technologically fruitful, we think it will be cheap or easy, and we think it will advance knowledge.  In short: technology, convenience, and <i>mystery</i>.  Grant funding and publication metrics, however, almost exclusively target convenience, with technological applicability coming in second-place and the fundamental scientific issue of <i>filling in our ignorance about Nature</i> stuck waaaay at the back of the bus.",1395917929

7479574,comment,7479419,7479419,12,0,tikhonj,,,"It feels like this article sets up something of a straw man. The analogy that a mind is like a computer is just that, <i>an analogy</i>. It&#x27;s used to present the high-level structure of the brain in a accessible, understandable way, not as a logical argument.<p>This analogy is <i>not</i> the justification for why people believe that &quot;the mind can be replicated on a computer&quot;. And yet the article tries to disprove the latter, deep and meaningful point by attacking the relatively superficial analogy between [current] computers and minds.<p>To me, the reasoning behind why I think a computer can <i>theoretically</i> do anything a brain can is much simpler. Programs are ultimately nothing more and nothing less than mathematics. Their capabilities are a finite (but theoretically <i>arbitrary</i>) subset of what mathematics models. And so far, mathematics has been able to model <i>everything</i>. Purely inductively, it seems mathematics should be able to model the mind just like everything else. After all, there is nothing magical about the brain!<p>At the limit of plausibility, we could just reproduce a mind by modelling a brain using the laws of physics. Sure, this is wildly impractical with current hardware. Perhaps we will never have the hardware to make it practical. But it also demonstrates how it <i>should</i> be possible theoretically: and if something is possible, no matter how impractically, there&#x27;s a reasonable chance that it&#x27;s possible in some significantly easier ways.<p>Saying that a computer can never fundamentally replicate a human mind is the same as saying the mind is beyond mathematical description. To me, this idea does not make sense. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s well-formed! Mathematics is not a finite set of ideas or a bounded language: it is more like a standard of formality which we can extend in an incredible amount of different ways.<p>Sure, math has some internal limitations like incompleteness. But these are not really <i>absolute</i> bounds, at least not in the most obvious way. One thing to keep in mind is that mathematics is purely self-contained: all that matters is internal consistency, not a parallel to anything in our actual universe. This means the fundamental limitations are inevitably <i>meta</i>-limitations: they come up when we turn math on itself. Moreover, they only come up when we start encountering the <i>infinite</i>. The human mind may present some meta facets, but it is <i>not</i> infinite, so incompleteness cannot prevent us from modelling it.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to note that all the actual arguments for why a computer cannot represent the mind are not actually logical themselves. They rely on vague analogies and emotions, quoting Ionesco but not providing actual reasoning.<p>Ultimately, it feels like this article is trying to establish a false balance between the two sides of the argument. But they are not anywhere near equal: the people that don&#x27;t think a computer can model the mind need to present an actual case for why it&#x27;s beyond the capabilities of mathematics, the system which has fared so well in describing everything else. Where does the line between physics and cognition (which exists on a purely physical plane) come from? Why are they divided? To me, that line simply seems to arbitrary to accept without more cause.<p>I can see why this line of thought is appealing: consciousness certainly feels <i>magical</i>, so you want to find some real magic there. But I am not convinced real magic exists. Or even makes sense. It would require the human mind to somehow be special in a way that would, at best, be a really suspicious coincidence. I&#x27;m not buying it.",1395917817

I used to really dislike it, but over time I understood that there are certain practical reasons to do this which deserve respect.<p>Due to the volume and novelty of data that we work with, we are often pushed into a corner between human time and machine time.  Each data set comprises a new set of concepts, and each is huge.  In this corner, sometimes a character-delimited file is the best solution.  There is not time to carefully craft a binary format and then document it so it will not be forgotten later, nor is there time to wait for a general-purpose format parser to operate on tens of billions of records.  We need a solution that can be designed in 1 minute and be legible by all of our tools without modification.<p>Typically, I have used tabs in the place of the ASCII separators.  This ensures readability without any kind of parsing.  Also, this lets me use the default behaviors of well-worn, bug-free tools in the core of the Unix toolchain for basic data processing tasks.  Frankly, this is not a bad compromise.<p>If you are passing messages around a web stack, JSON, XML, and friends are ideal solutions.  If you have to occasionally deal with CSV, use a parser.  I just want to note that for many tasks in data analysis, it&#x27;s OK to simply use the <i>dead and dusted</i> convention of mixed delimiters and data.<p>As these things develop, I will be trying to investigate how to use more modern formats such as binary JSON representations in my work, and I&#x27;d be curious what solutions people here suggest for working with very large data (e.g. many trillions of observations).",1395916986

Obviously, others will disagree, but that&#x27;s not the point.<p>The point is that some organizations and developers want to use cutting edge languages, and the majority are more conservative.

This is one perspective; there are others:<p>Monad is an interface.  It is used when reifying certain kinds of context to give a standard way of chaining those contexts.  That reification means 1) you can talk explicitly about those contexts, and 2) the type system can enforce more rules around those contexts.  The abstraction provided by the interface means we can hide away a lot of the plumbing.<p>The Monad interface is defined in terms of a type <i>constructor</i>; that is, a type-level function that takes a type as an argument and produces another type - like a C++ template with one argument.  There is a sense in which the monad &quot;wraps&quot; the &quot;inner&quot; type, though for some monads this is metaphorical at best.  Still, it provides a vocabulary.",1395915235

Because we don&#x27;t even know all the kinds of tumors that are out there. What we do know, however, is that, to this date, no commonality between _all_ tumors has been identified. The smart money is on the hypothesis that there is no commonality, since many possible combinations of cellular malfunction can lead to tumorgenesis.<p>For instance, I distinctly remember having read a review in Nature a few weeks back about a study of certain brain tumors that can either be caused by mutations of some genes, or alternatively can be caused through a purely epigenetic mechanism.

Therefore SpiderOak never even sees unencrypted data. That's their ""zero knowledge"" policy. They think it's better to make it impossible for themselves ever to have any idea what files they're hosting, rather than saying ""We used to know X seconds ago, but we don't know anymore.""<p>The blog doesn't mention whether or not SpiderOak uses block-level deduplication.

But the later ads of kids jamming with their iPod ear buds communicate a message that is much closer to the general perception of Apple as a brand today.<p>The Think Different ad was about Apple, the company. Kids jamming with their iPod earbuds was about the iPod. The Think Different ad was about revitalizing the Apple brand, and Jobs points out how the Nike ads aren't even about the product to explain the logic behind that ad, not to suggest that Apple was going to take that approach forever like Nike does. It makes sense that after they'd established the values they wanted associated with Apple, they'd return to product-centric advertising.<p>In 2008, ten years after the Think Different campaign debuted, six years after the slogan was mostly retired, and well after the earbud ads hit their peak, there was a study on whether flashing Apple or IBM logos faster than could be percieved could prime people to be more creative. The results suggest it's not really necessary for them to keep playing up that angle.<p><a href=""http://www.physorg.com/news125073871.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physorg.com/news125073871.html</a><p>I won't say the restrictive policies governing iOS hasn't dampened the message somewhat for people like us, but you have to remember that a lot of it is about empowering people who aren't super great with computers and don't feel they have the freedom to use them the way anybody here does, because of their complexity and vulnerability.

1)	have they proven that they are serious?  Sometimes they are just fishing for competitive information or trying to steal code (don't get all paranoid and defensive, but be smart, don't show code. Show efficacy). Make them prove that your company and tech is specifically what they need and that they have a cash ready to pay.  If they say ‘well, we can get money to buy you’ then I’d be suspicious.
2)	What is the company worth to YOU? Its not just about cash, but is the offer of employment something positive or negative to you?  Then ask yourself what the company is worth to THEM.  Do they need this badly and can’t do it themselves?  Or is your tech one of several vendors they can buy?  There can be a large difference how you two value your company.
3)	Consider your alternatives such as the following: keep going on your own, ask them to license the tech from you, ask them to invest in you, charge them for consulting
4)	Consider their options: are there others to acquire and is the industry in consolidation mode right now where if you don't get acquired you loose your chance.
5)	Overall DO NOT SHOW THEM CODE unless they buy it or license it or put up cash in escrow with an escrow entity that YOU choose.  If they are buying tech, you can offer to let them test it out for efficacy.  Seeing code does not prove efficacy.  In the final due diligence of a deal they can inspect the code or you can mutually agree to a 3rd party inspecting the code.",1282946134

Depending on configuration settings a system may automatically be sending in watson reports for certain kinds of crashes. This makes it possible to track down the origin of a virus / worm after the fact. Step 1: take notice of the exploit in the wild. Step 2: determine it's method of operation. Step 3: correlate watson reports with exploit (likely there will be many of these). Step 4: backtrack to the oldest reports which might be from when the exploit was being developed, then dig out as much information from those reports as you can.<p>Certainly this doesn't work all the time, but even if it worked only very rarely it'd still be a pretty substantial payoff.",1282945759

""I don’t think there is anything particularly new here. PG says that the definitive description of good founders is “relentlessly resourceful.” I’m pretty sure that “toughness” is a big part of that. Can you take care of yourself and get (sh)it done, or are you a wimp?""<p>I'm pretty sure that ""relentlessly resourceful"" and ""tough"" are largely disjoint.  Likewise, taking care of yourself & getting shit done, and folding in the face of adversity, are not as related.  Why did he choose those things as either/or?  It's a strange choice.  So it's not wrong, really, but it's not really right, either.<p>Being ""tough"" can help founders be successful, but i don't think it's causal, just highly correlated with what <i>are actually</i> the good predictors.  So the author banging his chest and talking about how he can just hear you describing his company as so damn tough is -- while not false -- not very useful.<p>or how about this:
""Tough people choose decisiveness over diligence.""
That's just terrifying that he would present this as a choice, and i would run away from having him as an operator.  First, it's a false dichotomy, but more problematic is that it doesn't matter how decisively tough you are -- if you're shooting from the hip, you'll miss.  Is he trying to address analysis paralysis?  Because if so, that's a very strange choice in language he's used.<p>Put another way:  In the post above by jiu-jitsu practitioner where he is describing grit, i think he's absolutely right to say that grit is something incredibly useful in non-physical arenas.  As a boxer, i've watched a lot of people get through some really brutal places.  However, that 'grit' emerges from some very different internal motivations, such as a) raw ambition to be the best, b) a deep fear of the shame of failure, c) for the sheer hell of it, d) because a girl is watching, and even it looked like e) from a sublime appreciation of the present moment.  (Zen boxer, totally weird) -- but they all were able to push through places where I watch a lot of people quit, stop working, stop pushing themselves, etc.<p>When Mr. Godin is talking about the importance of actually shipping software, and the difference between people who ship, and people who don't -- he's not framing that in terms of tough vs. wimp.  Those words are pretty loaded with anthropological baggage.<p>Actually, i'm finding myself repeating what api is saying upthread, so i'll join in up there :)  My real contribution is that if 'grit' is the observed behavior, i think 'toughness' is the wrong trait to look for that produces it.",1282944892

I don't understand it myself, but somehow they were able to change the world despite not being able to create these apps. I totally agree that Gandhi's plan A was to make a Farmville-style game that let's you make illegal virtual salt, and MLK was going to make a SimCity game where you could control a character who refuses to sit at the back of the bus. This is historically documented. Obviously supporting mass protest and civil disobedience in such a safe, efficient, convenient way, so that people could do it whenever they had a spare moment, like waiting in line at the movies or the grocery store, is very threatening to the status quo. And the authorities refused to allow those kinds of apps (or any apps, or smart phones of any kind) because they were correctly seen as too powerful at creating widespread social change, too upsetting to the status quo.<p>Now, I know what you're going to say: ""Yes, but we only are allowed to have smart phones because the authorities have found ways of neutralizing their subversive potential! The apps that are truly threatening will be rejected!"" I admit this is true - powerful corporate lobbyists have sabotaged my own app where you earn points and badges for turning off lights and composting your trash because of how devastating this would be in their attempts to keep people mindlessly consuming.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, keep hope alive. Yes, Apple's authoritarian iron fist thwarts our attempts at changing the world, but remember that Gandhi faced similar struggles against the violent British colonial regime, and Martin Luther King faced death-threats, even finally being assassinated. Yes, we mourn all our fallen apps that have been ""assassinated"" or ""lynched"" by Apple's arbitrary app store policies, but we must not lose hope, we must continue the struggle and endure these heavy losses.

I do not think it is that hard to understand, compared to e.g. complex analysis or number theory. Didn't work hard enough on some the exercises, but certainly understood all the simpler ones. I would not recommend reading this to every (would-be) programmer or computer scientist, though. Especially for those wanting to program on 1GHz+ CPUs with 1GB+ RAM, there are things that are more immediately useful. Also, even for the low-level stuff the content of the books is getting seriously dated (e.g. due to the absence of multi-threaded algorithms)",1282943580
1640295,comment,1639727,1639727,0,0,tpwong,,,"I saw pg give a talk a couple of weeks ago at a YC event for Cornell alumni (I'm May '10 and still on campus doing research + my own projects), and asked what he thought the reasons were that Cornell didn't have a larger startup community. The response he gave was that few VCs, if any, are ever going to go up to Cornell, which I think validates your first point. Here there's no prestige associated with starting something, and being a typical status-obsessed Ivy League, it figures that creating a startup doesn't even occur to most people. Contrast this with Stanford, which has produced many successful startups, and where not working at a startup is a conscious decision that people make (or so I've heard).<p>That being said, another reason for the lack is partly that the hacker culture isn't as visible at Cornell, given its many schools and diverse set of students. I've met people with interesting projects that few, if any, ever catch wind of.<p>I think moving forward, there is reason for hope. Firstly, Cornell has a large student population, which provides rich soil for fomenting and validating ideas. Next, the CS department is fairly highly ranked, so one hopes that there is a good amount of talent out there. Finally, there have been some startups founded by Cornellians in recent years, both while in school (e.g. Wiggio) and after (Opzi, YC funded, I think). You have to look a bit harder, but the signs are there. A friend of mine developed jitouch, a multitouch extension for the mac in his free time, and is now working on an ios game.<p>People are interested. Especially with the Gates building coming up in a few years and serving as a nexus for all things computer, the time is near when all the disparate threads will be woven together. The seeds are already being planted. I met a sophomore at the talk I alluded to above who's excited about bringing a startup weekend type event to campus this year. Clubs also help, and I think to be useful to hackers, you want to provide at least:<p>1. Opportunities to network to find co-founders - i.e. startup weekend, demo day, meetings/weekly brunch (or other meal)<p>2. Opportunities to share and develop ideas - i.e. startup weekend, demo day, hosting resources (maybe)<p>3. Guidance on what comes after - speakers (though it is admittedly hard to convince people to come up to Ithaca), maybe networking with some angel investors once in a while, perhaps curate a biweekly/monthly newsletter of startup related news (for visibility).<p>The best is yet to be.

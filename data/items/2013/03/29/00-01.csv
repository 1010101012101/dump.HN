Our goal is to allow people to communicate and transact with privacy and security.<p><a href=""https://gli.ph"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gli.ph</a><p><a href=""https://gli.ph/s/privacy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gli.ph/s/privacy.html</a><p>Today, you can use Gliph to send text and picture messages with other Gliph users. It has a few benefits over other messaging tools:<p>- The messaging system is hosted, so you can access your account from either the iPhone, Android or Mobile web.<p>- Either party can delete messages from both sides of the conversation, delay messages, and set expiration on messages.<p>- The system allows you to be anonymous, we don't require entry of any personal data such as a phone number used by other messaging clients.<p>Gliph's Email privacy tool is called Cloaked Email. We debuted it in August of this past year. You can use a Cloaked Email address as substitute for your real one while signing up for websites. Cloaked Email:<p>- Helps protect you from data breaches.<p>- Allows you to communicate with sellers on sites like Craigslist using your normal email client, without revealing your actual address.<p>- Has Chrome and Firefox plugins to easily integrate email privacy into your web experience.<p>Some other points about Gliph and privacy:<p>- We don't log IPs except for rate throttling.<p>- We encrypt all personal data entered and set sharing to private by default. When you share data with another user, it is encrypted using public keys of both users.<p>- You can turn on a feature called Lockdown Privacy Protection, which removes password reset and makes your account data inaccessible by anyone without the password.<p>- We have a generous privacy policy that puts ownership of user data in user hands.<p>We launched in March of last year, and have an iPhone, Android and mobile web clients.<p>I'd be pleased to connect with you on Gliph. You can find me at Dice, Heart, Lightning.<p>Here are some more links:<p>iPhone app: <a href=""https://gli.ph/iphone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gli.ph/iphone</a><p>Android App: <a href=""https://gli.ph/android"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gli.ph/android</a><p>mobile web: <a href=""https://gli.ph/m"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gli.ph/m</a><p>Company Blog: <a href=""http://blog.gli.ph"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.gli.ph</a>",1364518595

5458651,comment,5458284,5458449,13,0,potatolicious,,,"Ah, if only SF housing was so simple.<p>> <i>""$100,000 is very reasonable, and you should be able to live anywhere here.""</i><p>$100K is really not total-freedom money in a city like SF. Take the FiDi and Mission Bay for example - $3200/month for a 1BR means $38,400 in rent every year.<p>That's spending $39% of your <i>pre-tax</i> income on rent, a deeply inadvisable amount, if any sane landlord would even allow it. Even if we drop the rent to $2500 to open up options in the Haight, Castro, and Mission, we're still talking about $30K in pure rent.<p>Nowadays I'm in NYC, where no sane landlord will let you break the 40X Rule, where your monthly rent multiplied by 40 may not exceed your pre-tax annual income. On $100K that's $2500 a month - and that's an <i>absolute</i> upper bound rent. $2500 is totally feasible in SF, but you definitely won't have your pick of apartments. A income of $100K would be well-advised to stay <i>under</i> $2500, where pickings are increasingly slim.<p>> <i>""Also, bear in mind most people live in couples""</i><p>Citation needed. I know a lot of people who have roommates in SF, but SF is a notoriously single city. I'd be <i>extremely</i> surprised if >50% of SF's population is living with a spouse or partner.<p>Some quick Google-fu:<p>In fact, it looks like as of the 2000 census[1] that 38% of the city lived alone, and 56% of households do not have a spouse or partner living there.

5458650,comment,5454147,5458012,1,0,rayiner,,,"Krugman is using the term ""income from labor"" and ""income from capital"" in a tax sense, in the context of payroll taxes, because in the tax code we distinguish between ""income from labor"" and ""income from capital gains."" But of course we still live in a world where all income ultimately derives from labor applied to capital. E.g. when Google throws off a fat dividend, that's counted as ""income from capital"" for tax purposes, and Krugman is saying we should tax that to fund the retirement system. But Google, of course, makes it's money from engineers. If Google didn't have engineers, it wouldn't have any money. If they don't have enough engineers, they make less money than if they do.<p>Now, we could have a future where capital really does generate production by itself (everything is automated by robots). We're not anywhere near that point yet. For the foreseeable future, even to the extent that profits from Google, Facebook, etc, are counted as ""income from capital"" for tax purposes, it still depends fundamentally on human labor.",1364518558

5458632,comment,5458430,5458430,3,0,KingMob,,,"While I applaud the desire to teach meditation, I'm a bit skeptical of this.<p>For starters, this is a sales page, and the author is promising a lot of benefits, but fails to mention that meditation is sometimes stressful and unnerving. It perpetuates the popular hope that you'll gain mild superpowers from meditating like improved balance, learning, and memory.<p>How do they plan to provide ""objective"" feedback? Physiological and neuronal instruments are still very simplistic. There are a good number of dedicated researchers (Richie Davidson's lab, anyone affiliated with Mind and Life) trying to get decent neuronal measures of meditative states, and they've barely begun. I doubt something simple like muscle tone, heart rate or EEG is sufficient. Even in fMRI, the voxels are too large, and the acquisition rate too slow to adequately capture and isolate many effects.<p>For another, $590 for a weekend is a bit steep. In most buddhist traditions, the teacher receives nothing except by donation (the buddha explicitly forbade charging for teaching), and what fees there are, are for accommodations and food. If you do a Goenka retreat, you can get a whole ten days for free, since they operate strictly by donation.<p>Looking at the instructor's bio, he lists a lot of his math and martial arts training and experience, but nothing about where and with who he learned to meditate. This, and the tone of his writing, suggests that he's picked it up from reading, tried it for himself, has experienced some slight changes, and now believes he's qualified to teach it.<p>All that being said, if you were to go, I doubt this will be harmful, and it may be beneficial in the long run if you come out of it believing you can meditate more. I think the more likely scenario is that you will spend a bunch of money, and develop a relatively simple understanding of meditation.<p>If you're in the Bay area, I would suggest checking out places like Spirit Rock or SFZC/Green Gulch/Tassajara instead.",1364518375

As you can see, it's totally non-functional but can be potentially deceptive to average users.<p>It's all kind of funny except it seems to be used to scam people. We know of least 1 person who got charged on their credit card by this pixanyday pretending to be Everpix and then complained to us.<p>Of course, we're checking with our legal counsel what options are available, but I'm really interested in discovering what's the masterplan of whoever is behind this?<p>PS: My best theory so far is that it's used to test stolen credit card numbers. They charge a few bucks to them, and if it works, then know the card is valid. If the user notices the charge soon enough and visits the website, it seems legit (and cheap too) and then possibly thinks the spouse did it and leaves it at that.",1364515409

5458450,comment,5458245,5458245,1,0,SilentStump,,,"Very interesting thesis. The more the ratings and demand dropped, the more news agencies have to sensationalize to compete with other options. However, in terms of the polarization of politics, I'd have to say that stems more from  the concept of echo chambers. The polarization doesn't stem from the competition with cable, etc. A lot of it comes from individuals only consuming information and opinions of one side, which in turn pushes each group farther towards those positions.<p>edit: Another interesting comparison is how a news site like Hacker  News (or even Reddit) reaches a decline in the content being provided.

5458441,comment,5451202,5457748,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Task parallelism was something used to work on 20 years ago when we thought it was the solution to scaling. But then we found that the supercomputer people were right all along, that the only thing that really scales very well is data parallelism. So the focus in the last 5/10 years has been finding data parallel solutions to the problems we care about (say deep neural network training), and then mapping them to either a distributed pipeline (MapReduce) or GPU solution.<p>> It is within recent memory that if you wanted 20+ CPUs at your disposal, you'd have to build a cluster with explicit job management, topologically-optimized communications, and a fair amount of physical redundancy.<p>You are still thinking about concurrency, not parallelism. Yes, the cluster people had to think this way, they were interested in performance for processing many jobs; no the HPC people who needed performance never thought like this, they were only interested in the performance of one job.<p>> As many of the applications requiring low-end clusters tended to involve random numbers or floating point calculations, we also had the annoyance of minor discrepancies such as clock drift affecting the final output.<p>Part of the problem, I think, is that we've been confused for a long time. Our PHBs saw problems (say massive video frame processing) and saw solutions that were completely inappropriate for it (cluster computing). Its only recently that we've realized there are often other/better option (like running MapReduce on that cluster).",1364515319

Statistically speaking there are probably quite a few unexposed flaws right now in any compact, core linux distribution. The fact that no one yet knows what they are is precisely what prevents the exploitation. Security holes are numerous and the ones that have escaped detection generally continue to do so - the rate of co-discovery is very low in the field.<p>Warning ahead of time is thus often very useful - it allows the infrastructure to prepare to make the changes quickly.

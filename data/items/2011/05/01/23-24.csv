I personally think Scheme would be a good choice.<p>Learning the mathematical background first might be a good idea if you're a mathematician. Otherwise, getting at least some practical exposure in a language may cause the math to make more sense to you, should you decide to study it later.<p>For Scheme, some good books include: <i>The Little Schemer</i> and <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>.<p>A good sample project might be to build some sort of language intepreter. For Scheme-based ideas, take a look at the book <i>Essentials of Programming Languages</i>. One of the early projects in that book is to build an arithmetic expression evaluator; by that point, you should be well on your way to thinking functionally.",1304294351

He got Sun Microsystems one of their first contracts by camping out in the lobby of a customer (they wouldn't take his meeting) and meeting them on their way out daily to tell them why they should do business with him.  He did the same thing to get into Business School at Stanford.  He was rejected but just came anyway and after hanging around for two weeks, somebody dropped out and they let him in.

Some preliminary digging through Google implies an increase in this kind of language recently. The number of search results for ""illegal cyberattack"" (unquoted search string) in news.google.com is 150 for 2011, 242 for 2010, 185 for 2008-2009 <i>combined</i>, 72 for 2007, and 55 for 2002-2004, and a number of the older results appear at first glance to be unrelated to actual hacks.<p>That's odd.<p>edit 2: Massaging the search terms a bit seems to yield proportional results. For example, compare the language in this article from 2007 (<a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3966047"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3966047</a>) against the language of similar articles today.<p>I know it's off-topic, but now I'm quite curious why around 2009 or 2010 everyone suddenly decided that they needed to emphasize the illegality or criminality of compromising systems?",1304292679

The fact that there isn't a definition for bad teachers doesn't mean there aren't bad teachers (you have to agree with this) and that something shouldn't be done about them.

Cassandra is similar and both will auto heal if a node goes down. Projects like drbd will do block level mirroring of a partition between a set of machines with only one master elected at a time.<p>Some usage patterns don't care if the data is lost, they just care that the I/O is fast. Consider a group of identical machines serving up read-only data round-robin'd via a load balancer. If one goes down, who cares? Only the load balancer does. A new machine gets provisioned and gets added back to the group. DuckDuckGo probably has a data lifecycle that pushes out a new read-only index set on a regular schedule. If the data is kept in S3 and pushed out to read-only nodes then this is a very good use case for only using the ephemeral drives.<p>Servers where writes occur are really the ones that need to be durable. Best case would be for the application to wait until the write was fsync'd on multiple machines if you're faced with node failure at any moment.<p>This topic is kind of a rabbit hole. If you're using ephemeral drives and can't stand to lose data since your last backup then you have to use some sort of multiple machine architecture. Once you do that you're at the mercy of the network. A set of postgres servers in master/slave replication will always have the possibility of losing writes since the slave replication is asynchronous. Cassandra and other quorum-write based systems can make it so that if you write to a single node, a quorum of nodes must agree upon the write before returning the ""block written"" signal to the client.<p>Really the CAP theorem[1] explains it all.

2504322,comment,2503467,2503467,1,0,lyudmil,,,"I find the following sentences from the post contradictory:<p>""[Outwardly focused developers] copy and paste code they find in blog posts even if they dont actually know how it works.""<p>""Both [the vocation/avocation and inwardly/outwardly focused] scales are value neutral.""<p>I think the first is clearly describing a bad developer. I suspect it is also meant to. There are other such instances in the post, which I fear drains it of content. Sticking with the second scale, it seems to me that when faced with a problem, the appropriate Ruby code ought to be:<p><pre><code>  def solve problem\n    my_solution = hypothesize_solution_to(problem)\n    \n    existing_solutions = find_existing_solutions_to(problem)\n\n    #The sort other is by quality\n    existing_solutions.sort!\n\n    existing_solutions.reject do |solution|\n      solution.sucks? or my_solution.better_than?(solution)\n    end\n\n    return existing_solutions.first unless existing_solutions.empty?\n    my_solution\n  end\n</code></pre>\nThere's some refactoring needed, but the algorithm is correct. I think doing anything different without a <i>very</i> solid reason is irresponsible.",1304291210

It's similar enough for syntax not tripping anybody up.<p>One of the problems with JavaScript's C-like syntax, IMO, is that it makes people think in a C-like way. CoffeeScript's syntax brings out the functional qualities of JavaScript in a nice way. Writing CoffeeScript makes me a better JavaScript programmer.<p>Further, if you're working on a Node stack there are a few levels where CoffeeScript and JavaScript can interact. Different modules can be written in either language. You can expose a http.Server interface in your application. If you're on Connect/Express, you can mount routes to apps written in either language, or even Zappa.<p>And if you want a moratorium on new syntax, I suggest you stop learning new syntax. I look forward to a future where syntax moves further into the background.",1304291110

We just finished a prototype, raised some seed money, and are headed for greatness. Hopefully. This is a chance to work on some architecture from the outset of the product. I'd prefer those who have a possibility of coming on long-term as I build out the team, most likely around Palo Alto, but do have immediate needs that lead me to consider splitting up short-term chunks of development for freelancers. In any case, we're distributed for now so remote is the only possibility.<p>backend: postgres, python, django, gevent + gunicorn<p>frontend: coffeescript, jQuery, backbone.js, socket.io, modernizr, compass<p>I'm looking for:<p>1. Advanced web jacks-of-many-trades. You know a lot about several things from above and have at least tried your hand at a demo app using the rest. Backend/frontend/deployment.<p>2. A specialized front-end dev who knows their javascript in-and-out. We're designing a single page architecture for the most part. Mobile browser experience would be good.<p>3. Mobile app developers (native iPhone & Android, though we're considering phonegap as well to get something out there faster).<p>We're staying distributed for now -- I'm based in Palo Alto but spend a fair amount of time with some of the team in DC as well.<p>gmail - davidmarble",1304291024

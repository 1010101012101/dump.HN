2033652,comment,2033261,2033261,0,0,A1kmm,,,"The article, when read carefully, seems quite disingenuous, because given the way the points are carefully phrased to sound sensible while actually being wrong, it is hard to believe that the author actually believes the argument themselves.<p>Going through it point by point:<p>* Their first argument against is that it is hard to define network discrimination. But it really isn't, and I can define it in one sentence: routing network packets differently depending on anything other than header information specifically designed for routers to process (IP headers in the case of Internet Protocol), or routing outgoing traffic based on destination addresses with the intention of deliberately slowing traffic to some destinations but not others.<p>* 2 - to paraphrase ""Internet access is not a right, so we shouldn't protect it"". The reality is that so much human communication, including participation in democratic processes and a huge part of the economy happens online, and so it is reasonable to consider it a human right. The fact that it is relatively new doesn't change that.<p>* 3 - To paraphrase ""Network discrimination can be good, because it lets operators:<p>Stop immoral practices like spamming or 'hacking'""
(presumably they mean cracking). That some people might do bad things not a good reason to censor the Internet. Favouring downloads over uploads for technical reasons - that is not really within the scope of network neutrality.<p>Conserve bandwidth - they give examples about usage caps, which are content neutral so outside of the scope of network neutrality. Specifically trying to slow certain applications, relative to another, is not necessary to limit bandwidth usage in a neutral way.<p>Promote brands - this is exactly why network neutrality is needed - network operators shouldn't be able to exploit their market position as gatekeeper to the Internet to favour one company over another.<p>Preventing 'theft' of service - except that if I pay for bandwidth, it is not theft to use it however I like, including allowing others to use it. Another good argument for network neutrality, not against.<p>Implementing a variety of network access charges to help to recover costs - ISPs can make money charging users for bandwidth in a non-discriminatory fashion, so there is no need for them to exploit their market position to charge people who aren't even connected to the network as well - and stopping them from doing that is a legitimate aim of network neutrality.<p>* 4 - to paraphrase ""consumers might want more than a dumb pipe from their ISP, and if they go too far, the market will take care of it""; ISPs can offer services which are optional to consumers - that isn't a network neutrality issue, it only is when they become compulsory (e.g. you must use our nameservers) that it is. No consumer wants to be forced - at best they will tolerate it or it will make no difference.<p>*  5 - to paraphrase, ""the market will sort it out"". The market can't sort it out, because there are high barriers to entry, it is a finite market, and so the market is not infinitely efficient (and in some areas approaches a monopoly), and in practice there is little room for consumer choice influencing Internet markets except with regards to price, advertising, and to some extent reliability. While consumers benefit from network neutrality, very few are in a position to take this into account when choosing services.<p>* 6 - To paraphrase ""ISPs should be free to put whatever they want in their contracts"". The reality is that 'freedom of contract' is not fair when there is a huge difference in bargaining power, the markets can't sort it out for the reasons discussed above, and government intervention is appropriate.<p>* 7 - To paraphrase, ""Network operators own their equipment and should be able to do what they like with it"". That is like saying gun owners should be able to do what they like with their gun, even shoot people. It is reasonable to put in place laws against certain types of unreasonable exploitation of a market position, and property rights don't extend to using the property to break those reasonable laws. The argument here seems particularly disingenuous.<p>* 8 - To paraphrase, ""network neutrality will discourage innovation and investment"". The reality is that network operators can still profit from charging users for access - and that is enough to encourage investment. The main limit on ISPs profits is likely to be competition, and all ISPs are subject to the same laws - so no service that was profitable without network neutrality is likely to become unprofitable because of network neutrality.<p>* 9 - to paraphrase ""introducing laws around the Internet will encourage players with a special interest to try to game the system"". There is an obvious and simple solution to this one - transparency and openness in decision making. Gaming works both ways - gaming to not introduce network neutrality because it is in corporate interests anyway.<p>* 10 - to paraphrase - ""putting in place Network Neutrality laws will start down a slippery slope towards government control of the network"". Nothing specific to any network neutrality law makes it easier to change laws around the Internet later, so the argument is wrong. Unjustified corporate and government interference in network neutrality are equally big issues, and network neutrality fixes one of the problems and makes no difference to the other one.<p>All in all, none of their arguments stack up.",1293083143
2033651,comment,2033357,2033536,0,0,nkurz,,,"I think you are more wrong than right.  While 'kosher' is a dietary standard, there are certain conditions that must be met before meat can be considered kosher.

2033629,comment,2033357,2033357,0,0,andreyf,,,"That's silly. Many laws are meant to minimize people harming each other. For example, the point of laws that control whether a child may bring a dagger to school is for the safety of minors, who don't have the neurobiological facilities to make good decisions (e.g. whether or not to bring a knife to school, or whether or not to use it). I imagine it's easily demonstrable that enforcement of those rules yields less stabbings than an ""everyone bring your knives"" policy.<p>Now, before you think it, nobody is saying that such restrictions on freedom are the proper long term solution to stopping kids stabbing each other, and better solutions should be put in place, but in the meantime, lives are literally at stake. Of course, it's also easily demonstrable that Sikh children don't really ever kill each other with their ceremonial daggers.<p>So frankly, I don't see a good argument as to why the law should never use race as a metric to optimize safety for minors while not infringing on the ceremonial customs of certain groups.",1293082234

2033592,comment,2033357,2033477,0,0,slammdunc23,,,"I think the turban example is perfectly consistent with what the author said. You ask ""how would rules such as the uniform rule for the police ever evolve?"" The answer is: in much the same way! Under this author's understanding of that example, the rule under scrutiny would be: ""Every policeman must wear a uniform cap."" The Sikhs, wishing to wear dastaars, would petition the chief of police to be able to wear a dastaar instead. The chief of police (or whoever), would then think to herself, ""Well, is it all that important that our police officers wear matching CAPS, or is the important part merely that they wear headgear that matches the rest of the outfit and contains a badge?"" She would then conclude that the more appropriate rule, which should apply to /everyone/, regardless of his religion, should be that every police officer must wear a hat of the appropriate color and that the hat must contain a badge. A Sikh could wear a dastaar; an atheist could wear a baseball cap or a turban--or a dastaar. The point is that /anyone/, not just a Sikh, can wear /any/ hat he chooses, so long as it meets those standards that /are/ considered too important to change, such as matching color and a badge.<p>I think another example might be more clear. Back in the 1990s, there was a big hullaballoo about Native Americans out West using peyote, a hallucinogenic, as part of a religious ceremony. Using peyote, however, was illegal in the state of Oregon, so a few members of the Native American Church were fired from their jobs and denied unemployment benefits after they were found using peyote. The Native Americans argued that they should be exempt from this law due to their religious beliefs, and many agreed. I don't, and neither did the Supreme Court (check out Employment Division v. Smith [1990]). And here's the reason: if peyote is ""not that bad,"" i.e., if it's fine for /some/ people to use it (here, the Native Americans), then it should be fine for /all/ people to use it. If peyote is actually /too dangerous/, if it really /must/ be outlawed, then it should be outlawed for /everyone./ What someone believes about peyote should have no bearing on his right to use it. (This is the same reason we wouldn't allow ritualized murder of children even if someone claimed it was central to his religion--it's simply too dangerous!) It's /discrimination based on religion/ (or lack thereof) to say that Tom, who believes that peyote helps him communicate with a higher power, should be able to use peyote, but that Bob, who simply feels that using peyote helps him relax and to paint, should not. Why should Tom's belief be worth more than Bob's simply because a higher power is involved? And what kind of law should involve litigating someone's religious beliefs? Imagine: Q: ""Isn't it true that you don't REALLY believe that peyote helps you commune with God?"" A: ""No, I swear I believe! I pray every day!"" Q: ""But I have a witness who says he saw you at Catholic mass last week! And here's a Bible we found in your house!"" What a horrible mess that would be!<p>To get back to the dastaar example, then, all the author is saying is this: If a Sikh should be able to wear a dastaar, then an atheist should be able to wear a dastaar on the job, too. In fact, an atheist should be able to wear any hat of the proper color with a badge on it. His beliefs or lack thereof should have no bearing on his right to do something that everyone else can do.",1293081208

7411777,comment,7411073,7411514,3,0,derefr,,,"Go isn&#x27;t a replacement for C++. You wouldn&#x27;t write an entire browser in Go.<p>Instead, I think, you&#x27;d write a bunch of fast browser component libraries in C (which is what already happens now), and then <i>glue them together</i> in Go to produce a nice, static, easily-deployed binary for each platform.<p>You know how in, say, games, you see people writing (needs-to-be-performant) mechanism in C, and then scripting (can-be-slower) policy in Lua? Go excels in this same niche[1] and the results from Go, unlike from Lua, can be treated (and debugged!) as native linked-in code.<p>I&#x27;d still rather the whole browser was written in Rust, though; those libraries that are right now written in C for performance could do with fewer crashes.<p>---<p>[1] ...if-and-when it&#x27;s the policy-writer who compiles and links the binary. If FooCorp ships a game engine as a complete executable binary, and you&#x27;re expected to just write policy <i>hooks</i> in Lua against the FooCorp&#x27;s &quot;framework&quot;, then there <i>is</i> an equivalent workflow for Go--you&#x27;d produce a dynamic library that the executable dlopen()s--but the result doesn&#x27;t have the same sort of elegance.

There is a pretty long history of anti-authoritarian political movements running into the problem that the <i>first</i> step of abolishing formal titles and declaring that your group has a flat hierarchy with collective leadership is... not enough to remove the actual existence of authority. If anything it can sometimes be worse because now there is a boss but it&#x27;s not explicit, and you have to be &quot;in the know&quot; to even know who calls the shots. While at least with a President or CEO or Supreme Leader the actual boss is labeled, and everyone has fair notice of who he/she is. So the problem is what to do about that: abandon the flat-hierarchy idea, or try to push it further into a really-flat-in-practice organization?",1395010648

7411767,comment,7404345,7408245,1,0,dalke,,,"That&#x27;s a tough one - and an interesting challenge! Almost everything I could think of either didn&#x27;t come with a risk of disaster (or at least, no risk of major disaster), or has had major disasters.<p>The best I came up with was determining longitude based on the lunar distance. It could be disaster for a single ship that got it wrong, but I don&#x27;t think there were major disasters during the 80 years (2-3 generations) it was in service.<p>I can think that a fleet might have ended up in the wrong place (like the Scilly naval disaster of 1707), so there <i>could</i> be a major disaster, but a fleet also has enough independent people doing their own reckonings that it would be self-correcting. I looked through the UK and French lists of ship disasters, but found no multi-ship disasters based on location errors during 1767 to ~1850.<p>(If you want a physical technology, rather than mathematical technique, then Hadley&#x27;s octant, integrated with Vernier&#x27;s scale, which made the octant precise enough that sailors could use to judge longitude usefully. In turn, it was effectively replaced in the 1800s by the sextant.)<p>But I don&#x27;t know enough about nautical history to know if there were major disasters caused by octant/sextant use which were comparable to pre-lunar distance methods.",1395010571

Code signing, secure boot (including TPM when used as a part of that), and patch protection do, and can be disabled.  Linux distros really should probably have more rigorous protections along those lines, but manage to avoid it because nobody targets Linux (not because it&#x27;s that much more secure); Chrome OS has them anyway, despite almost everything being open source, including Chromebook bootloaders, and I like that fact.<p>Meanwhile, proprietary software and closed hardware specifications have nothing to do with security and should be criticized more harshly.",1395010518

If you cannot identify such people, but think they are out there, do everything possible to find them. Go through Linkedin and see who in your extended network fits your target market and find someway to talk to them. Email people or message people on blogs or social sites that seem to have the pain point you have identified. In reality, you will need to talk to far more than five people in order to narrow it down to five people who clearly need your product.<p>Once you have found a set of people who need your product, get their feedback on the idea, show a mockup or prototype, and ask if they would buy it. If a bunch of people say &quot;yes&quot;, time to go build! But as you build, make sure you check in very regularly with potential customers, so that you stay on a the right track.<p>Keep in mind there is a big trap you must avoid in this process. Many prospective customers will be positive about an idea, but they overestimate their own willingness to get through the friction involved in adopting a new product.  So the prospect says the idea is good - but then you build it, and they don&#x27;t actually use it, because turns out email and excel had a bunch of hidden benefits that make them better than your product.<p>As an entrepreneur, you need to implore people to be brutally honest in their feedback, lest you build the wrong thing. You should focus more on identifying their pain-points than on pitching your own solution. You also have to make your own judgements about how big the pain point is, rather than just blindly trusting a prospect when they say they would buy your product. And you should to some extent reverse pitch - (&quot;Did you think of solving your problem by doing X? Do you really need me to build a product to help fix this?&quot;)",1395010304

(It&#x27;s not happening at the OS level, I already have that part configured correctly, it&#x27;s the bios coordinating with the EC itself).<p>3) They don&#x27;t bother to actually hook up the acpi bios correctly, so many of the generic acpi platform functions (e.g. get_brightness/_BQC and set_brightness/_BCM) don&#x27;t work correctly. Instead, they rely on (going back to #1) the platform map that Seems To Work As Detected except that it&#x27;s detected as something similar, but not correct. I had a bunch of things break on kernel upgrade due to the mapping having a bugfix to make it work correctly for the hardware it was intended for, which made it work incorrectly for the serp7 that was squatting on it.<p>4) When I called support about #3, their answer was &quot;reinstall the ubuntu version it shipped with and try again.&quot; I asked for enough documentation to actually solve the problem- I intended to implement a system76-specific acpi driver (think &quot;thinkpad_acpi.ko&quot;); I was informed that that information was proprietary and would not be released under any circumstances.<p>5) These laptops are fragile.

Stores!&quot;<p>A new approach: Anchor stores, entertainment, utility, accessiblity, asthetics, a spectrum of economic appeal, grocery stores.  Owners can be demanding of rents to some extent, but when they drive out (or never had) a movie theatre or grocery store, they are losing the &quot;single destination for lots of what you need&quot; and &quot;nice place to go&quot; value.<p>Of some LA malls, I think the Fallbrook Center [1] has rebuilt itself well, regarding:<p>* Entertainmnet-wise, AMC Theatres rebuilt the old shoebox-y 7-screen multiplex with way fewer seats.  Moreso, every movie theatre seat is a wide-width, electrically-powered recliner including footrests!  What used to be 20 rows of seats is now 7 or 8 for one screen, so prices are a bit higher.  One can /reserve a seat/ via Fandango over the Internet (fee refunded by AMC) so one doesn&#x27;t have to come early and wait in line for &quot;a good seat&quot;; they&#x27;re all good and one can book them in advance.  The theatre feels much more full, and seems more popular.<p>* By &quot;spectrum of economic appeal&quot;, specifically, Fallbrook has /three/ full grocery stores (a &quot;Ralphs&quot; (Kroger) supermarket, &quot;Sprouts Farmers Market&quot; luxury grocery, and a &quot;Trader Joes&quot;, plus two more department stores that include grocery sections: A Target and a Walmart.<p>* Utility-wise, it&#x27;s got a Home Depot, a 24-Hour-Fitness gym, a Chuck-E-Cheese (hat tip to Nolan Bushnell)<p>* Accessability-wise, there are street lights at mid-block entrances for auto traffic, and bike lanes on the streets for bicycle traffic, and bike racks (though I&#x27;d like to see more of those).<p>* For asthetics, there are planters and small stand-alone buildings facing the street (urban-style).  This broke the ugly old impression the prior desert-of-asphalt a hot summer&#x27;s day brought.<p>* Instead of a food court, the small buildings facing the street are a mix of stand-alone and multi-tenant places to eat, both sit-down (indoor) and walk-up bar with outdoor seating.  Market diversity here too: Starbucks, Jamba Juice, IHOP, a lobster specialty franchise, and a non-franchised grill (Tikka grill) and non-franchised Vietnamese restaurant.<p>They&#x27;re doing fine, there is such a diversity of things to do as well as things to get there.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallbrook_Center"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallbrook_Center</a><p>Edit: grammar, clarity",1395008098

But most recently as I just experienced, it gets unbearably slow sometimes.

(pun intended)\nIt all started in the mid 90&#x27;s with a huge contract to supply: glifosato aka Roundup® to spray large coca fields throughout the country. The outcome of this experiment has been a new super strain of Roundup resistant coca crop known as &quot;Boliviana negra.&quot; A toxicologist, Camilo Uribe, who studied the coca, said: &quot;The quality and percentage of hydrochloride from each leaf is much better, between 97 and 98 per cent. A normal plant does not get more than 25 per cent, meaning that more drugs and of a higher purity can be extracted.&quot;<p>In addition to this Colombia recently signed a free trade agreement with the U.S that introduced a law known as:&quot;Ley 9.70&quot; This law basically forces farmers to only grow food crops from semilla certificada (patented seeds) and guess which companies are supplying these patented seeds? Monsanto, Dupont and Syngenta. This is causing great financial hardship among campesinos as they can&#x27;t afford to buy seeds every growing season and this has already resulted in peasant protests late last year which resulted in over 40 civilian casualties. As if farmers didn&#x27;t have it bad enough being stuck in the middle of an armed conflict they now need to comply with this new law or disappear.<p>If you were genuinely interested in this subject you could do a little independent research of your own and you would see that Colombia is not an isolated incident by any means.

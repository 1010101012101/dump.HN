1024214,comment,1022703,1023954,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"<i>But what would an organism adapt to if not overcoming challenges to reproducing, under selection pressure?</i><p>Our minds -- whose involuntary emotional reactions drive our behavior and impart to us many of our basic values -- are evolved.  Evolution tinkers, reuses, never redesigns or reorganizes.  So instead of pushing us toward the single, monolithic goal of having children, we experience constant nudging to do things that are conducive to reproductive success.  Support yourself.  Be well-liked.  Have sex.  Love your children.  Achieve status.  In slogan form: evolution's instrumental values are humanity's terminal values.<p>So to answer your question, we act to make ourselves happy, and what makes us happy <i>approximates</i> what is good for the next generation.  There are gaps, though.  Some people to focus on their careers to the exclusion of family, and contraception doesn't engender the same reaction as eating rancid meat.  I tend to think this is a good thing, but I'm status-quo biased and my values are largely a product of the current arrangement, so that's unsurprising.",1262264380

</code></pre>
I'm not debating or questioning the use of a labal to capture the concept.  I'm suggesting that the sepcific label you are using is itself a barrier to communication.  To speak of someone failing to exhibit ""intellectual integrity"" feels like you are accusing them of dishonesty.  I don't think, in truth, that you are doing so, but that is how it might appear.<p>You could consider a better label for the near inhuman, almost Vulcan, ability to put asides one's own opinions and beliefs in order to listen to the points being made by someone else.  Calling it """"intellectual integrity"" is, I think, conveying the wrong message, and caries too much baggage.<p>And yes, I suspect we are more in agreement than not.  I, perhaps, am giving more leeway to those who are not trained to set aside their natural tendencies.  It's something I've had to learn, at times painfully, upon entering a business environment after doing research in pure math.  It seems to be a requirement, and simply one of those things one has to do in order to communicate effectively with people from the ""Real World.""<p>Sad, but true.  I've had to learn to live with it.",1262263955

If someone shows up at your door threatening you to provide them with a disk image, you can happily comply.  When they realize the data is useless without the Constitutionally-protected secret key that only exists in your mind, they will have to file charges, and get a judge to order you to testify against yourself.  And right about then, the investigation stops, because you committed no crime, and the order to testify against yourself is illegal.  (If anything, it means you have plenty of time to talk to your attorney.  They are not getting the data any other way, so you have the power to say, ""wait, let me get my lawyer first"", even if they physically seize your hardware.)<p>I also have a few drives in my house that look like LUKS encrypted disks, but are actually a LUKS header with random data following it.  There is no way I could ever decrypt these disks, as there is no data on them; just random bits.<p>Anyway, you can tell that this was never a real criminal investigation, because a real investigator would get Gmail records from Google, not from some random guy with a laptop.

Now I'm doing product management there.<p>I'm assuming you've written a native app vs. a web app.  (If not, my apologies - ignore any advice I give you.)  While I'm ridiculously biased, I'd recommend going with Flurry Analytics.  In a couple months, it'll have the superset of features from both Pinch and Flurry.  The data is processed using Hadoop, and reporting updates very quickly.  It's built for multiple platforms, so it'll stay with you if you decide to build for multiple phones.  And the company's well-backed and doing well financially - which is an important thing to consider, because once you release a smartphone application with analytics code in it, at least some installs are out there forever, since you can't force 100% of your users to upgrade.<p>Of course, because I'm ridiculously biased, you probably should check out other solutions in the space as well. :)",1262263546

Have to parse a minilanguage? Use an FP approach. Control UI widgets? Do it in OOP style, that's what it was designed for. Keep track of global game state? Just write it imperatively and be done with it.<p>As a professional you need to understand the good ideas in your field, but as a responsible worker you need the wisdom to avoid pushing those good ideas beyond their proven area of application. One day you'll read an article somewhere that will demonstrate how Haskell is a great fit for ragdoll physics simulations (for example), like it happened before with Parsec for parsing (another example). Until that day... don't rush in blindly believing that purity is better for every class of problem. It might be, but we don't have anything resembling a proof yet.

The console business is very fluid and dynamic due to the gigantic reset button of new hardware platforms every 5-7 years. The 360 hasn't been a run away success -- in fact it may turn out to be the weakest selling console of the big three when all is said and done due to Sony's big advantage in worldwide sales. The 360 has been very successful in the US, not as successful as the Wii, but as you said profitable at least. The big question for Microsoft is what happens in the next generation of hardware. They will be presumably taking another round of losses when they launch the successor to the 360 over the next couple of years. I'm not quite sure where they payoff is here for Microsoft. They need a big smashing success to get ahead of the game or they will be on the treadmill of the console industry indefinitely. Big loss, some profit, big loss, some profit...",1262263374

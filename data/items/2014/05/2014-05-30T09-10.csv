They will never be as popular as the other team in that city, and they don&#x27;t even pull in half the revenue the Lakers do.  Given the team&#x27;s negative history, not even considering the recent debacle that forced the sale of the team, they&#x27;d do well to come up with another brand that could have greater resonance with the local and national audience.

7820995,comment,7820517,7820517,5,0,zokier,,,"> Web browsers can be a problem. <i>You may want to choose Internet Explorer</i> rather than Chrome, since Microsoft has clearly done more work to support high-PPI configs. However, note that IE ditches the ClearType sub-pixel antialiasing scheme and snap-to-grid GDI font rendering in favor of simple greyscale antialiasing. As a result, the effective text resolution with IE at high PPIs isn&#x27;t a huge leap from other browsers with ClearType on conventional displays. [emphasis mine]<p>Umm.. I know Firefox is not fashionable these days but ignoring it completely seems bit odd, especially if both Chrome and IE produce suboptimal results.<p>Also can&#x27;t you these days force compatibility bitmap-scaling for applications like Fraps that apparently do not work correctly with HiDPI? Sure it is one extra step that ideally shouldn&#x27;t be necessary, but it is not like you need to live with broken UIs.",1401443684

7820992,comment,7819245,7820524,3,0,robert_tweed,,,"I&#x27;ve used Octane, which is a GPU-only renderer. Unfortunately, it is VRAM-per-GPU bound. In other words, you cannot render any scene larger than the usable VRAM per GPU. High end video cards with lots of VRAM also tend to have more than one GPU, so the VRAM-per-GPU figure is actually (total VRAM)/(total GPUs), with slightly less than that actually available for the scene.<p>I&#x27;ve also experimented a bit with Lux which has a hybrid CPU/GPU mode. However I&#x27;ve found it isn&#x27;t necessarily any faster than CPU only on my system (which has a lot of CPU cores) and it isn&#x27;t as stable.<p>AFAIK, there are no video cards currently available with more than 6GB per GPU, since something like a nVidia Titan Z with 12GB has to share that between 2 GPUs.<p>It&#x27;s conceivable that as GPU rendering becomes more commonplace we&#x27;ll start to see manufacturers loading more and more RAM only high end cards, possibly at the expense of compute units if power consumption is a problem. After all, a render farm with many separate cards is just as fast as one card with more compute units, but VRAM per GPU is currently a hard limit that will affect anyone rendering very large, complex scenes.",1401443530

Google is approaching monopoly status in the search space because we&#x27;re allowing it. With a bit love, DuckDuckGo and Bing could make dents.<p>I think the other problem is that search doesn&#x27;t matter as much to anyone else. Yes, Microsoft made Bing, but Bing is essentially a side project for MS -- their crown jewels are Office and Windows, and everything in the company revolves around that. \nJust like everything MS does ultimately comes back to Office and/or Windows, everything Google does ultimately comes back to search.  If a company with resources, like Amazon or Microsoft, made search a top-tier priority, they could take marketshare from the big G.<p>One potential move that would greatly assist Bing, for instance, would be for Microsoft to make Android phones and put Bing as the search provider instead of Google. They could team up with Amazon and use Amazon&#x27;s app store. Instead of doing this, Microsoft released a totally separate platform. Why did they do that? Because Java is competition to C#. Who cares about C#? Microsoft cares, because C# (and Xbox, and...) is about keeping Windows the dominant platform for any and all software, because that&#x27;s how you keep selling Windows licenses and keep Windows shipping on every PC sold. It&#x27;s all about protecting their lock-in. If MS embraced Android, they may help Bing, but they&#x27;d be undermining the Windows lock-in strategy.<p>Every company comparable to Google has similar problems.

Indeed, as long as you do what is required to ensure nothing goes wrong (""bonus pater familias""), but an accident still happens, then society/German Law accepts no one is liable.<p>Your argument seems to point more to: How do you define someone as liable and how do you enforce it?",1250758713

They should be allowed access to legal aid even a pro deo counsel.<p>It is not impossible actually for a legal system - that over time has passed judgement to witches, dogs donkeys, used torture to extract confessions and in some parts of the world demands its high priests to wear funny clothes and wigs - to be modified to suit the new circumstances.<p>In the meantime if you developing software for automating trains, aircraft or heavy construction machinery get plenty of Professional Idemnity Insurance.

Frankly I think he is wrong. What's needed is as capable device and slightly lower total cost of ownership. Hero comes close IMHO.",1250758039

774654,comment,774568,774618,0,0,patio11,,,"We also have fairly well-developed laws and case law on animal attacks.  If you keep a chihuahua in a jurisdiction which does not have strict liability, and it bites someone, you are likely not at fault unless you had reason to know it was prone to violence AND you took insufficient steps to restrain it.  Your local jurisdiction may have strict liability (""It is the owner's fault, period"") or may have designated certain breeds as ""aggressive dogs"" whose owners are presumptively liable.<p>You could see this happening with the law of machines, too.  Roomba crushes someone?  Awful but lawful.  KillBot9000 mistakes a troop of Girl Scouts for armed revolutionaries?  You're probably going to end up liable.",1250757268

This is exceptially disturbing and often in Go, where there&#x27;s some cargo cult in many advocates that they have found the be-all end-all way to code.<p>It seems to me this push for &quot;idiomatic&quot; is also related to the Blub paradox.

Alan Kay used the cell as a metaphor: it&#x27;s a complex machine that interacts with the rest of the body using a simpler language of chemical and electrical signals. And that turned out to be such a good idea that you see it even in non-OOP programming tools. Haskell&#x27;s type classes are a comparable idea. FP picks the best noun (immutable data) and verb (referentially transparent function) for most purposes (of course, the world is stateful and there&#x27;s some debate over how to manage that). At scale, we also have to deal with the &quot;adjective problem&quot; because we want to be able to code against abstractions rather than (less stable) implementations.<p>For example, it&#x27;s a good thing that languages support a File object (an abstraction that Unix is built on) that allows application programmers to avoid having to know what kind of &quot;file&quot; they are dealing with. It&#x27;s nice being able to use the same language (open/read/write/close) regardless of the physical machinery that the file lives on.<p>The problem is that corporate OOP has become complexity for it&#x27;s own sake. Alan Kay wasn&#x27;t saying, &quot;Go out and design massive, complicated objects&quot;. He was only proposing strategies for when complexity became inevitable. Unfortunately, Business OOP (a bastardization of OOP, which had some good ideas at its core) rewards complexity, and you have &quot;enterprise architects&quot; who can&#x27;t code but are paid to generate massive tangles of lines and boxes.",1424879241

At present the majority of go code I&#x27;ve seen simply imports dependencies from github or similar without versioning and hopes for the best. Unless the <i>other pkg author</i> wants to version, that&#x27;s all you can do unless you want to vendor (for large dependencies like net/html that can be impractical).<p><i>If you mean something more complicated like automatic resolution of different version specifications (e.g. ver >= 1.2), then no, nothing exists like that.</i><p>That&#x27;s what the parent was asking for I think, and more than that something which applies to all pkgs.

So starting out where everyone is remote is a huge burden to add to an already really tough situation.  I think even if you look at the successful companies that have a significant number of workers remote, you&#x27;ll find that when the core team started they had a majority of people in the same location or very close. And you&#x27;ll still find that a number of the people are in a given area or get together very regularly in person (which has a cost to it).<p>If you are an already established team with multiple prior successful remote projects, then that might make your chances of success go up some.  But the likelihood of being successful still, in my opinion, goes down many times over when core members are not near each other regularly.<p>I can hear the people saying oh it worked for us blah blah.  I am sure you can find cases where it has worked.  I am sure I can find cases where it was a massive failure.  Neither of those matters as much as the overall statistics and your gut feeling on whether it will work.  Just remember, everyone will have to be willing to work extra hours just because they are remote, those extra hours will be spent mostly in communication and clarifications and working across time zones.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think remote work is awesome and is super successful when implemented properly. But for a small company just starting out or small team barely off the ground I just think the burden is too high to make it successful fast enough.",1424878831

Networks can always fail. At best you can detect this occurring and have your build process scream and die, but it can&#x27;t be fixed.<p>Note the complete lack of the word &quot;Go&quot; in the previous paragraph. If other languages provide package managers that make it easy to download code from the Internet during your build process, they are <i>tempting you to do wrong things</i>. You should be in personal possession of everything you need to do a full build, whatever that may be (source or otherwise). And, again, note the complete lack of the word &quot;Go&quot; in that sentence.<p>This has nothing to do with Go. If you are depending on package managers to download your code from external sites during a build, stop reading this right now and GO FIX THAT. Seriously. Someday it will bite you, <i>hard</i>.<p>And may Turing & Knuth help you if you&#x27;re downloading packages with unpinned versions that can just upgrade to whatever they want, whenever they want.<p>Now I will actually use &quot;Go&quot; in a sentence. The fact that Go expects you to vendor your source I do not consider a problem with the language. The fact that it fails to ship with a blessed tool for doing so is a potentially legitimate criticism, but the fact that it fails to ship with a tool that begs you to do the easy, wrong thing is a feature, not a bug. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that they eventually bless something out of the community. Godep seems to be the current leader.

He said that 4G phones (possibly 3G too, I don’t recall) only use the shared secret key for the initial sign-on to the parent mobile network. Thereafter, new keys are generated and stored at both ends and it&#x27;s these keys that are used to authenticate the end points and bootstrap encrypted connections. New keys are re-issued at intervals, although I don’t know what the interval time is.<p>So whilst it would be possible to decrypt phone connections if you had your hands on the original secret Ki stored in the SIM, you&#x27;d have to record every connection between the phone and the network in order to obtain all the subsequent keys as well & if you miss out on the initial sign-on, or any individual re-keying then you’ll be shut out of that phone’s radio communications thereafter.<p>I imagine the NSA would be willing to try and do this for some target networks, but where they already have internal network access (US/UK/Five Eyes, any other network they&#x27;ve hacked into) it would be a lot of pointless effort.<p>The fake base station attack presumably works by forcing a downgrade to 2G, which is another approach, but one that requires local assets on the ground within phone range (unless you can do something with high gain antennas pointed at a specific target phone from a distance? That sounds hard, but the NSA likes hard as we know - throwing resources at something isn’t a problem for them.)",1424878226

I made sure to follow some recommended users to see their solutions as well, which helped reduce much of my parentheses bloat.<p>My favorite thing about using high order functions has been that provided your underlying functions are tested/correct, you can more easily reason about and test your new functions, particularly when you keep things immutable/side-effect free.<p>I&#x27;m sure I would have gotten to this point eventually without Lodash, but being able to make use of bits and pieces at a time was a major catalyst for me.",1424877820

It&#x27;s not like any true Scotsman is deploying by running pip update in production either. As a developer you want to have code that compiles at all times. Having a binary you can&#x27;t reproduce or change isn&#x27;t going to be much comfort.<p>If you&#x27;re going to use third party libraries there is no reliable way to judge the stability of either the libraries you use directly or all your transitive dependencies. Pull in enough dependencies and the chance of a conflict approaches one. Some of your dependencies will get updated and some of them won&#x27;t, and soon enough you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding any combination of versions that will compile.<p>Dependency management is not optional, but unfortunately Go makes it easy to hurt yourself by providing climbing holds without a safety harness.

I have public keys available and I understand the concepts at a high to medium level but if it&#x27;s taken me as long as it has to get a grasp on it (And I still would need to do a number of google searches if I received an encrypted email) how can I expect all of my friends to ever get it? They want something that &quot;Just Works&quot; and so they gladly use (as do I) Facebook, iMessage, SMS, and Email. All unencrypted (Well iMessage is encrypted but I know they could easily view any messages they want). They still have password-reuse issues all over the place (my hands aren&#x27;t clean either).<p>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t care about privacy, I very much do, and my friends care as well (to a slightly lesser extent I would say and I&#x27;m willing to accept more to get to that point than they are). It&#x27;s just that I am completely overwhelmed, only 1-2 of my friends even understand encryption at a high level and none of them expose private keys for communication. Even other developers I worked with got annoyed with OTR with adium/pidgin to the point I had to turn it off. It&#x27;s not that I want to throw in the towel, I desperately want a solution, but even easy to use (what I&#x27;m looking for) &quot;secure&quot; communication tools get torn to shreds here on HN and so I haven&#x27;t even considered trying to get them all to switch tools (even I thought it was possible, which I don&#x27;t).<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is I&#x27;m not going to stop talking to my friends and my friends more or less refuse (due to complexity) to use encryption so what is the purpose of me even trying? The end result would be what? Maybe 1-2 people with which I can talk securely? Now I have to have 2 workflows and even if I have super-secure unique PW&#x27;s, FDE (Full Disk Encryption, which I do use), and take steps to secure all MY data all of my friends are essentially leaking my data. So if the NSA/FBI/China/Hacker/etc want my communications they can just go after the weakest link, the people I talk to. It&#x27;s very disheartening to say the very least.<p>I&#x27;ve considered blogging about this a number of times but didn&#x27;t want to get destroyed here on HN (if I even posted it here, I probably wouldn&#x27;t due to backlash) for being defeatist or get told how I am the problem. I am not a cryptographer and therefore am not qualified to even attempt to build secure software (if I even thought I was capable of coding up such a project). Even the tools that are easy to use that DO use tried and true encryption (Like PGP gmail/chrome extension, that&#x27;s all well and good but what if I&#x27;m on mobile? Or on a friends computer? It&#x27;s just too restrictive) are locked to a an OS/Browser/Device.

What does this have to do with Ubuntu ...""</i><p>The demographic that might be looking for such an easy to use application will probably be using Ubuntu.  Most of the other users will be using vi/vim, emacs (don't start it) on the command line on numerous different persuasions of *nix ",1191387066

62474,comment,62348,62447,0,0,cirroc,,,"Very good point on getting the partner involved in the loan- I'd like to do this, but I'm not sure how to. We have a Delaware corp set up, but since the company doesn't have any credit, I don't know how it could take out the loan. <p>Perhaps the company could take out the loan, and we could both co-sign?<p>We're probably about 3 months from being at a point I'd feel comfortable charging- If we got a 10K loan, we could probably cover this easy. <p>The problem comes in that if our estimates are off, we've made the world a lot more painful for ourselves. We've had quite a few customers asking to pre-register, but I don't like the quality of experience that would give.<p>I appreciate the advice, thanks.",1191386876

If Facebook could be bigger in its 6th and 7th year, then Steve Ballmer will eat his words. Until then, the fact that social networking site is a fad stands still.",1191386841

62465,comment,62109,62452,0,0,gnaritas,,,"""destroy"", ""stealing"", what world are you living in? You don't steal people, they leave or stay of their own free will.  They're not trying to destroy you, they're trying to succeed for themselves, and making an offer to a talented hacker <i>at any time</i> is perfectly legit.  To think otherwise is silly, the other team doesn't owe anyone anything.  If I offer a hacker from another company 20% more $$ to come work for me and he takes it, that's called business, not ""stealing and destroying"".  Besides, you can always match the offer.",1191384340

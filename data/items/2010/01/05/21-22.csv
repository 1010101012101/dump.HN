The 80-bit internal 8087 FPU precision has always been a mismatch for the 64 bit IEEE double representation, even before the presence of SSE registers (which don't have the 80 bit mode) complicated things.  Intel 8087 code has always been able to produce different results for the same source code, depending on when/whether/which intermediate results get spilled to memory.  The Motorola 68k FPU had the same issue with higher internal than external precision, IIRC.<p>This isn't a bug.  Both code paths produce results of the highest representable precision of the hardware in question.  It's just that there are multiple hardware units capable of giving you the answer, and Apple's toolchain picks a different one than whatever Tom is using elsewhere.<p>And as has been pointed out in FooBarWidget's comment -- any code that relies on bit-precise results from floating point computation is almost certainly concealing precision bugs anyway.

So I'm going to go out on a limb and try to guess how this works, and maybe extract some more specific information.<p>1) Recognizing the musical notes. From here (<a href=""http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~elec301/Projects02/realTime/301Project.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~elec301/Projects02/realTime/301P...</a>): ""Fourier analysis allows us to decompose any such pressure function into a sum of\nsinusoids.  Therefore, any sound can be represented as a sum of sinusoids.  If the sound has a pressure function that is aperiodic with respect to time, decomposition into sinusoids is quite complicated.  However, if the sound is periodic with respect to time, it can be easily decomposed and transferred to the frequency domain using a computer and the Fast Fourier Transform."" And since each note has a unique frequency/octave associated with it, it could be easily identified via a frequency to note database.<p>2) Recognizing the time-measure of the song (i.e., whether the song is 4/4 or 3/5), since this is required to do straight-forward Fourier transform and also perhaps to mark chord changes. I'm guessing this is either done by simple analysis of any periodic and consistent rises in the sound frequency of the song. Or perhaps, this is done via the same Fourier transform analysis of the sound waves and mapping out where the peaks fall.<p>3) Recognizing the chords; once you have figured out the notes and beat measure. The rest follows pretty easily, you have a chord database of all of the note-triads to chords and map out the chords accordingly. But the challenge there is, what if you have a rhythm guitar going at the same time while there's a solo? How do you map which notes to which guitar. Perhaps, the instruments are recorded onto different channels and you group on notes according on the degree to which they pan to the left, to the right, etc.<p>4) Separating out the instruments from one another; Maybe grouping notes via panning is not enough. Perhaps, you need to do some timbre analysis to group the notes that sound like a guitar vs. notes that sound like a bass guitar. Since each instrument has a distinct harmonics and overtone. You guys have some type of classification algorithm that classifies what portion of the sound belongs to what timbre of the instrument.<p>Any comments/response is appreciated.",1262727819

The whole interpreter was designed from the beginning to be embedded in another (typically C or C++) project, and they didn't want to have any concurrency infrastructure in the core language that would clash with the surrounding project's design. (It has excellent support for coroutines, though.)<p>Rather than having static variables and a GIL, the interpreter keeps all its state behind an opaque pointer to a VM context. The VM is quite lightweight (a few hundred K), and running in each thread or process is not a big deal. With forking, you even share the standard libraries. In practice, this just means that every call to the Lua C API starts with (""lua_State *L""). Not a big deal.<p>Lua also has real tail-calls, closures, and lambdas. It's a great language.

(<a href=""http://www.github.com/swolchok/lark"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.github.com/swolchok/lark</a>) I've never implemented a Lisp or used it for anything serious, and I've been trying to figure out for myself whether there really is anything to macros or if they're just fancy compiler hacks, so I decided to write Lark as a way of learning what precisely pg is so excited about. It's a direct, lazy translation of ac.scm, except that I've written an evaluator instead of compiling to Python ASTs or bytecode. I'll probably compile to Python ASTs after I have a baseline.<p>I did cheat a bit and steal pieces from PyScheme and Lython as well as someone else's S-expression parser, but it's capable of evaling ((fn (a) a) 1) as well as Arc's ""if"" currently. I'm not certain whether it's Turing complete right now, but I suspect that it is because I can create and call functions, branch, and bind values to names. (IIRC, just being able to create and call lambdas is enough because you can count, branch, etc. Is that right? I haven't taken PL.)<p>Big problems right now are:<p>1) Proper lexical scoping. The current model is broken (it might be dynamic scoping), and Python 2.x's closures are broken so I can't just use Python functions to punt the problem to Python.<p>2) The shortcuts for quote, quasiquote, complement, compose, etc. The S-expression parser I stole doesn't have them. I don't want to use a parser generator because that seems to defeat the point of Lisp's lack of syntax (i.e., being easy to parse).<p>This is a toy that has nothing to do with my research interests (security), so it's not going to be actively maintained or developed. pg will probably make some breaking changes to Arc and kill the project.",1262725314

For example, it is a suboptimal curve to use if you are implementing spatial analysis operators in a distributed system.<p>If you were designing a spatial indexing system from scratch today for modern applications, you would use neither Hilbert nor Morton/Z curves but they are adequate shortcuts for sufficiently narrow applications. Substantially more optimal curves also have a much more complex description.",1439441254

10052256,comment,10052053,10052053,0,0,kazinator,,,"This is nonsense. There is no reason why printf has to be the sacrificial function that blows up on null. Those same &quot;misguided&quot; operating systems run on hardware that traps null dereferences via an unmapped page. A predictable, tidy crash is just around the corner if that same is used in the program. On the other hand, if that printf is the <i>only</i> place the pointer is used, then there is no security hole. It&#x27;s just undefined behavior on ISO paper, and you don&#x27;t agree with how it is locally defined by the implementation.<p>How do we know it&#x27;s a security hole? Maybe some structure has a &quot;char * &quot; name field, and null indicates &quot;anonymous/has no name&quot;. It&#x27;s an ISO C conformance bug to try to print that with %s, but that&#x27;s a portability issue. If that&#x27;s the only problem in the program (everywhere else it checks for null), there is no real issue.<p>POSIX and C libraries are not entirely about allowing null pointers or not.  For instance gettimeofday lets you pass a null pointer for the &quot;struct timezone * &quot; second argument, which indicates that you aren&#x27;t interested in specifying or retrieving it. On the other hand, a null argument is undefined behavior in getgroups, even if the array size is specified as zero (meaning, return me the size of the array actually needed and I will call you again soon with such an array)! A non-null pointer must be passed as a POSIX-conforming eggcorn. According to the logic of this article, if I pass null I&#x27;m committing a security hole, and an OS which allows getgroups(0, NULL) is misguidedly sweeping it under the rug.<p>Null pointers are not some &quot;bogey man&quot;. I built a Lisp dialect in whose implementation a C null pointer represents the nil symbol (empty list, false, ...). It prints as &quot;nil&quot;, satsifies the symbolp function and so fort. Lexical variables are initialized to nil if not given an initial expression. Some C library printing a null pointer as (null) seems like nothing by comparison.<p>Be that all as it may, you cannot actually <i>fix</i> this perceived issue by changing from (null) to crash, cold turkey. Unknown numbers of nonportable programs out there (otherwise well-tested programs) which rely on this will just crash.<p>I just did a &quot;grep -r -F &#x27;(null)&#x27; /var/log&quot; on a system here and found a few hits. Most of those are probably via the %s conversion, and all that code would have to be fixed if printf were to assert this. And that&#x27;s just instances confined to logging, not all output everywhere.",1439440198

If anything, you will use lower level `write()`, where EFAULT or something would be raised on NULL, and/or static buffers, where NULL is impossible. `printf()` is really only good for developer-friendly programming, where absolute rigor is not the focus.",1439438580

We&#x27;re obviously different animals, and it seems that birds can eat butter, so I wonder what it is about oils specifically that kills them. Likely the mechanism will be different from PTFE and PFOA and maybe incompatible with humans who also suffer from large-scale inhalation (see article). We don&#x27;t know much about long term PTFE/PFOA inhalation in small quantities.<p>So it seems to be that cast iron itself, heated, doesn&#x27;t cause the bird to die. Cast iron + butter kills the bird, but so does teflon + butter. So in butter-less dry pan to dry pan scenarios, cast iron is non-toxic yet teflon is toxic.<p>As you can see here [1] if you leave your pan on the stove heated it can hit these toxic temperatures within minutes. So the exposure to the gas isn&#x27;t hypothetical. Dry pan toxicity is a real concern which is unique to Teflon.<p>Then there&#x27;s digesting it since it will slowly wear off into your food. We don&#x27;t have science specifically looking at long-term slow exposure to PTFE/PFOA. So you&#x27;re taking your chances... but we do know that PFOA is much less inert than PFTE when digested.<p>Non-stick pans won&#x27;t last as long as cast iron or stainless steel, and cast iron can perform like non-stick while also adding flavor and necessary iron. Oh and cast iron can be often as cheap or cheaper than non-stick (except for the super crazy low end, but talk about most likely to be toxic...), and most certainly is cheaper in the long run (I&#x27;ll have my great-grandmother&#x27;s pan for the rest of my life which I do 90% of my cooking in... try that with your teflon).<p>So if you don&#x27;t need non-stick pans, so why voluntarily expose yourself to the risk?<p>[1] <a href=""http://buffalobirdnerd.com/clients/8963/documents/Teflon.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buffalobirdnerd.com/clients/8963/documents/Teflon.pdf</a>",1439438574

At the time nobody on the team really thought they were going after rss, news reading, or discovery. But it turns out that trying to solve that problem in parallel to the status update system. Twitter was for a long time very much built upon the RSS stack of technologies. It was a semi-open platform which worked better, unfortunately, than the fully open world of RSS & ATOM.<p>In the end, now 8 years later, it&#x27;s clear that twitter DID kill rss as a dominate category of apps & services. We went from being overwhelmed by unread counts on the &#x27;readers&#x27; to having flow. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s better, but it did solve the problem of feeling like you needed to keep up.<p>I think there&#x27;s still more interesting work to be done in this space. Open social networks (that&#x27;s what blogs are folks) plus users being able to control visibility of posts and frequency and open api&#x27;s could do something which could unseat twitter/facebooks.",1415116697

The USSR and the PRC had elections too; like any playground bully, the response of the state when caught cheating is always &quot;Oh yeah? You and what army?&quot;<p>In Egypt, just before the collapse of the Mubarak dictatorship (and just before the rise of another, slightly friendlier, military dictatorship), the Egyptian Army rolled tanks into Cairo. But the attitude there was far from confident. So much of the country was taking part in the demonstrations. Would the soldiers fire on a crowd that might include their brothers and mothers? The answer was no, and rather than have their subordinates turn on them, the military leaders turned on Mubarak.<p>In the United States, what will happen when we have our own Tahrir Square? Armed with the finest of &quot;less-lethal&quot; weaponry, from LRADs (sci-fi sound cannons that for those not in the loop about cool new police tech) to tasers to pepper spray to tear gas to drone surveillance, and just maybe weaponized drones, will the police, faceless and uniformed, be willing to launch tear gas into a crowd containing their families?<p>Personally, I think the answer is yes, because the American government is simply better at doing its job than the Egyptian government, and that is why Mubarak had tanks while Obama has LRADs.<p>Get ready for the boot on your face, HNers.

You have found two sources about being an astronaut.<p>After you have reviewed these sources, you will answer some questions about them. Briefly scan the sources and the three questions that follow. Then, go back and read the sources carefully so you will have the information you will need to answer the questions and complete your research. You may click on the Global Notes button to take notes on the information you find in the sources as you read. You may also use scratch paper to take notes.<p>In Part 2, you will write an informational article using information you have read.<p>Directions for Beginning:\nYou will now review two sources. You can review either of the sources as often as you like.<p>Research Questions:\nAfter reviewing the research sources, use the rest of the time in Part 1 to answer three questions about them. Your answers to these questions will be scored. Also, your answers will help you think about the information you have read and viewed, which should help you write your informational article.<p>You may click on the Global Notes button or refer back to your scratch paper to review your notes when you think it would be helpful.

You decide to write an informational article on astronauts. Your article will be read by other students, teachers, and parents.<p>Using more than one source, develop a main idea about being an astronaut. Choose the most important information from the sources to support your main idea. Then, write an informational article that is several paragraphs long. Clearly organize your article and support your main idea with details from the sources. Use your own words except when quoting directly from the sources.

Purity is a composable property, but there are plenty of composable side-effects.<p>For example, let&#x27;s ignore all other effects besides file IO (especially ignoring internet IO). Further, let&#x27;s assume that our only IO operations are `(read path) => data` and `(write path data) => nil`. Let&#x27;s also assume that both of these operations are atomic (ie you can&#x27;t perceive a half-written file). If a build task attempts to read a file that doesn&#x27;t exist, that task pauses itself. When a file is written, any task waiting on the file are resumed. If you re-write a file, it has to exactly match the already written file, or the build fails. To kick-off a build, you wait on one or more files and then start one or more tasks.<p>Viewed this way, the file-system is a monotonic logic variable. Yes, the programming model is effectful, but there is a composable property: build repeatability. Just as you can compose arbitrary pure functions and get a pure function out, you can take any two arbitrary graphs of these constrained IO build tasks, compose them together, and the resulting larger graph will also be a repeatable build.",1415114650

And the navigation in FPS mode is so bad and has been for years.<p>Hell, and this one has always bugged me, they <i>still</i> after 7 years, hide the really important apps you have on google apps for business in a stupid little drop down hidden in a &quot;more&quot; link which isn&#x27;t even clear it&#x27;s a more link. Meaning the &quot;platform&quot; it&#x27;s supposed to be is actually just a mail app with some links tacked on.<p>Like Apple don&#x27;t say much, but then release something and nail it, while Google talk as if they&#x27;re an authority but consistently release complete messes.<p>This is actually getting me pissed off. How can they be thought leaders? Even their own site has rubbish UX choices:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html</a><p>Just look at the menu, it&#x27;s a complete disaster UX wise. Click menu choices just open accordion sub menus, they make the cardinal sin of forcing the user to click again and do extra work. And one of them, the &quot;Material Design&quot;, that just opens another menu with just one, YES JUST ONE, option of &quot;Introduction&quot;. How can you call yourself thought leaders and yet get something as basic as a menu so wrong? It&#x27;s like some sort of joke I don&#x27;t get. Did no-one at google try and use their own site to see how useless it is? It&#x27;s not a good UX. So how can you design good UX for the rest of us if you can&#x27;t get that right? And they even have .html in their paths. Argh. Hello 1990.",1415113774

So you have your mirror and your photon and you, and all that&#x27;s described according to some wavefunction |P(t)>, evolving according to the laws of quantum mechanics.<p>Now we observe that after the photon passes through the slit, we can decompose the function as |P(t)> = sqrt(0.94)|Q(t)> + sqrt(0.06)|R(t)> where Q and R are independent, each individually evolving according to the laws of quantum mechanics. This is already derived rather than fundamental, but the phenomenon is real, because the causality relation is real. Our neurons under Q (and of course a &quot;neuron&quot; isn&#x27;t really fundamental, it&#x27;s an interpretation of a particular group of particles behaving in a particular way, i.e. of particular aspects of the wavefunction) have no effect on our neurons in R and vice versa.<p>All that is physically real; the only remaining question is what we should expect to subjectively experience. Since our neurons in Q have no effect on our neurons in R and vice versa, it seems like we&#x27;d experience either being in Q or being in R. With what probability? Well, whatever it is it had better be conserved; it makes no sense to say that we&#x27;d experience R with 4% probability in 5 minutes and then 8% probability in 10 minutes. If we send another photon through in Q, splitting the wavefunction further into |S(t)> + |T(t)> + |R(t)> where Q = S + T, then our subjective probabilities should be such that the probability we find ourselves in S or T = the probability that we found ourselves in Q before sending the second photon.<p>What&#x27;s the probability-like quantity that&#x27;s conserved by quantum evolution of a system? Why, it&#x27;s the norm, ||P>|^2. I guess that&#x27;s what we&#x27;d expect to be the subjective probability then.",1415113579

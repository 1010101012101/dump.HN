Typically, I&#x27;d say I have a working set of windows consisting of gvim, iTerm2, a web browser (docs, research, etc.) and Hipchat. Cmd+Tab switches between <i>applications</i>, which isn&#x27;t quite appropriate here: first, it doesn&#x27;t consistently highlight the highest window in the Z-stack for the application being switched to, and it drags all windows of that application to the top of the Z-stack, which very often includes windows I am not interested in. Cmd+` can correct for this, somewhat. What I really need is just straight manipulation of the Z-stack.[1]<p>I use Expose extensively, but I find I use it because I lack a good method above.<p>I think one of the big draws to a tiling WM is that it allows efficient layout of windows, <i>especially</i> if you&#x27;re coming from OS X&#x27;s WM. Consider that OS X&#x27;s WM&#x27;s resize catchment area (the &quot;border&quot;) is impossibly small; grabbing it with the pointer in OS X is a consistently jarring experience IMO — small resize catchments work better in a WM that allows you to resize with a keyboard+mouse shortcut. E.g., in MATE, if I hold Alt, I can click and drag anywhere within the entire area of the window to resize; this is much more fluid, and requires considerably less concentration to perform. (I can similarly move windows, which requires grabbing the title bar on OS X, but this is somewhat less difficult.) Note that I can do this the OS X way in MATE too: grabbing the edge works. I&#x27;d add that MATE also &quot;snaps&quot; windows to the edges of the screen, and to each other, which IMO also aids quick layouts.<p>[1]: This is a big reason for why I run MATE at home.

An enumerated value doesn&#x27;t always carry around additional state, neither is it expected to carry around implementation information.<p>Applying polymorphism often creates an nasty inversion. If the situation is such that you need the algorithm to mutate &quot;outside&quot; data based on &quot;inside&quot; (the object) information, you end up calling a method on the object that &quot;passes in the world.&quot; This is a particularly terrible form of coupling since it obscures the straight-line path and allows new code to break old code when it gets used out of context.<p>The trick the article describes is more like what you would do if you were modeling this problem in SQL and decided to normalize the data into an additional table: Each enum now points to a static &quot;program&quot; containing various true-false properties - e.g. trucks are large, cars are not. Instead of checking the enum directly across all business logic, you can use it to look up an associated property. Subsequently, your test doesn&#x27;t have to be updated to account for new types of vehicles.<p>Algebraic data types (such as Haxe&#x27;s enum) that can do a compile-time coverage check and allow parameterization are another way to attack this problem.",1429170377

Such compensations are not as ridiculously high as they are in the US but still may be quite expensive for the person who _wasn&#x27;t guilty_ at the first place.

There are also usually two to three cases where a driver attempting to turn into the main street from the right (without right of way) stops on the bike lane and then gets upset if one attempts to drive around them.<p>The idea that German drivers are aware or tolerant of bikes is absolutely ridiculous – though of course they <i>may</i> be more aware and tolerant than Australian bikers, but I don’t know that (:<p>Unfortunately, policing these traffic violations seems to be perfectly uncommon here.<p>Of course, most of these wouldn’t be issues if we treated bikes like cars with the exact same rights and obligations as cars.",1429169736

The cow generally responds by searching frantically for its lost calf, repeatedly crying out for it until its throat becomes sore. The cow might also become sick and lose weight due to the separation. It continues with the milking process, which is painful and terrifying for the cows, as evidenced by their response. Milk-producing cows have been bred to maximize milk production, which means they have oversized udders that lead to illness. These are just a few examples of many. Generally speaking, cows in the dairy industry lead a short and exceedingly miserable life.<p>If the goal is to minimize suffering without going vegan, I think that wild-caught fish provide the least offending animal-based food.

Why couldn&#x27;t be s equal to 0? Note that a 0 probability event is <i>not</i> an impossible event and could still be in the event space. The problem is that there are countably infinite squares on the infinite plane so the measure of the infinite plane would add up to 0 instead of 1 by the property of the measure of countably infinite union of measurable sets.",1429167664

Even a two dimensional graph is expressing a relationship (and hopefully a correlation) between two sets of data.<p>I think whether or not there are relationships is the wrong way to consider the question of document vs relational.  I think of a relational schema as a canonical way to store your data so that you can easily and efficiently project it in multiple different ways (queries).<p>A document schema stores your data as one possible projection of that data.  Obviously you&#x27;re right that if you can know for sure that one particular projection is the vast majority of queries then this is fine.  The problem is that you have to be right about which projection of your data is most important, and normally before you write any code.<p>In my experience, for greenfield projects it&#x27;s surprisingly hard to predict what kinds of projections are most important.  Often what is interesting to users changes, or you didn&#x27;t quite have the right projection or whatever.<p>To compound this, a lot of document stores often don&#x27;t have good schema migration tools.  Migrating schemas and data is actually a lot easier with SQL than anywhere else.  Postgres can migrate the schema and the data transactionally and you can rollback if there is a problem in any of the steps.  They are also type checked.<p>Basically, when starting a new project, you are probably better off doing a relational model of your data than anything else.  Later, when you know your data access patterns, you can change to a document store and get the various benefits of them without the tradeoffs",1429167651

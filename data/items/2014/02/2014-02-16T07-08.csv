7247007,comment,7240894,7240894,1,0,salehqt,,,"I completely agree with the author and I would like to add my opinion to it as well.<p>As a computer science graduate, I had formal training (as in courses) at all essential levels of dealing with computer, from hardware to assembly language to high-level languages. and even the theory of computation.<p>After years of having formal training and hands on experience, I finally stopped doing any programming for fun and just stick to my day job and hate every minute of it. BTW, I have to work with worst programming language ever made by mankind: C++ (that is a statement, not a challenge dear professor Strostrup).<p>Why? because making anything useful takes toooooo much time even for an expert. For example, I had SQLite database full of text and wanted to format it as PDF. I was expecting to do it in like 10-20 lines of script, and it took me almost a week to do it. Every simple idea that I have ends up being hundreds of lines of code with complicated logic. It is just not worth the time. I ended up using Microsoft Word to generate my PDFs instead of writing a script, although I have to convert every document manually by clicking through MS Word.<p>One of the main issue is that programming is stuck in the 80s, especially for Mac and Open Source developers. Everything has to be done through the terminal. We have to look at walls of code for simple things. And every programmer have to start in terminal. When I started programming in 1997, I used QBASIC IDE in the terminal. One of the first things I learned was stepping through my code and examining variables.<p>The second main issue is that because the programming is stuck in the 80s and the times of POSIX standard, all systems have diverged to the point that very little functionality is provided by the system to the developer.<p>The third issue is the programming language itself. It does not have to be ASCII based. It can be visual. There are thousands of experiments with it and yet, still the mainstream programming is still ASCII based and the hot topic of debate in programming languages is whether to be indent-based or use curly braces.<p>Almost all of the main stream languages on top of the charts today are created before 2000. We need more languages suited to today&#x27;s software patterns.",1392537544

Almost always the answer is NO, that&#x27;s why you subclassed it to begin with! So you shouldn&#x27;t do it.<p>The entire point of subclassing is to be able to answer that question &quot;no&quot;. By your logic, we should never subclass anything, because it will behave differently!<p>It seems to me you&#x27;re not really trying to argue against subclassing here, but rather against making specific container types subclasses of generic containers types with extra logic (that breaks the container&#x27;s documented guarantees) added, instead of containing the logic and the container as class attributes.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the basic inheritance examples that show up all over, where Dog inherits from Animal: this makes sense because a Dog is a type of Animal. A Team is neither a type of List<T> nor a type of Set<T>, so it should not inherit from them. A team can, however, contain a roster represented by a List or Set alongside its other data.",1392537469

7246999,comment,7243757,7246926,0,0,kolev,,,"To me exercise in the gym is wasted time, not productive time, and that&#x27;s why my logic isn&#x27;t flawed. If I have a better use of my time, but hit the gym for some expected benefit, then it&#x27;s not the best use of my time. Some people may need exercise to feel good while others (like me), don&#x27;t. If you rely on exercise for your mood (thanks to the endorphins release), then you&#x27;re becoming dependent on it and it becomes an addiction. I personally fall asleep in less than 2 minutes. I forgot to mention that team sports is a different thing. I always enjoy playing soccer with my friends and children.<p>Regarding &quot;exercise&quot;, if you ask Dr. Weil, walking 20-30 minutes or doing garden work is the best exercise - that&#x27;s what the Okinawans or the Sardinians do. I think a walk is good enough to stabilize your blood sugar after a meal (even just 10 minutes of walk do miracles) and allow you lymph to flow.<p>Exercise also increases IGF-1, which is without much doubt negative for longevity: <a href=""http://blog.wellnessfx.com/2013/09/04/igf-1-trade-performance-vs-longevity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wellnessfx.com/2013/09/04/igf-1-trade-performanc...</a><p>Also, higher muscle mass means increased basal metabolic rate, which affects the lifespan potential negatively.",1392537227

7246989,comment,7246805,7246805,8,0,tzs,,,"I&#x27;ve suggested a similar idea to a few people. I called mine the &quot;fine dining food court&quot; (FDFC).<p>There would be one dinning area that is served by 4 different chefs. These chefs would be at the stage in their career where they want to get out and run their own restaurant, but do not yet have the money or the name recognition to pull it off. The FDFC would be a stepping-stone for them to that goal.<p>The FDFC owner would provide a large kitchen divided into 4 independent work areas (much like the kitchens you see on cooking competition shows like &quot;Chopped&quot; or &quot;Next Iron Chef&quot; or &quot;Top Chef&quot;). There would be a large pantry and walk-in fridge stocked by the FDFC, which any of the 4 chefs could take from as needed. There would also be some private pantry and fridge space for each chef that they could stock on their own.<p>The FDFC would deal deal with front of house, and would also provide sous chefs to assist the chefs (the chefs could also bring their own assistants, of course), and would deal with all the business aspects of the FDFC.<p>Each chef could provide several dishes for the menu. The menu would be sure to credit each dish to the appropriate chef.<p>The idea is that it is a lot cheaper for a chef to lease a cooking spot at FDFC than it is to open a new restaurant. He can spend a few months at FDFC, concentrating on a doing a few signature dishes well, to showcase his talent to the public and to potential restaurant investors, so he can get the name recognition and financial backing to strike out on his own.<p>The chefs would just deal with food. The FDFC would operate a bar for those who want to drink before dinner (or instead of dinner...) and would also deal with wine.<p>One of the owners of the FDFC should be an experienced and successful restauranteur, who would provide advice to the chefs if they wanted it.<p>The beauty of this is that the owner of the FDFC makes his money from the bar and from wine, and from leasing space to the chefs. If a particular chef&#x27;s menu bombs, there will be another young chef eager to take his place. This should be a lot less risky financially for the FDFC owners than owning a traditional restaurant.",1392537042

7246953,comment,7244109,7246557,1,0,lutusp,,,"> OP is incorrect that psychology is not a science.<p>Pretend to be a scientist and post your evidence. Here&#x27;s mine -- the director of the NIMH has recently ruled (<a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a>) that the DSM (psychology&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot;) may no longer be used as the basis of scientific research proposals, for the simple reason that it has no scientific content. The director went on to say:<p>&quot;The goal of this new manual, as with all previous editions, is to provide a common language for describing psychopathology. While DSM has been described as a “Bible” for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been “reliability” – each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity</i>.&quot;<p>&quot;Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, <i>not any objective laboratory measure</i>. In the rest of medicine, this would be equivalent to creating diagnostic systems based on the nature of chest pain or the quality of fever. Indeed, symptom-based diagnosis, once common in other areas of medicine, has been largely replaced in the past half century as we have understood that symptoms alone rarely indicate the best choice of treatment. <i>Patients with mental disorders deserve better.</i>&quot; [emphasis added]<p>There is often an embarrassing degree of self-reference in discussions where psychologists try to claim that psychology is a science. The defenders invariably see no need to produce evidence for their claim, as though evidence is irrelevant in a discussion of science. And for a typical psychologist, saying psychology is a science is expected to end a conversation, whereas for a scientist, that claim can only begin a conversation in which evidence rules.<p>> Next up we have this whole notion of falsifiability. It&#x27;s a red herring.<p>Only if science isn&#x27;t defined as it is in the law -- which it is. Science-defining laws are on the books to keep Creationism out of public school classrooms, and while crafting those laws with the assistance of expert witnesses, guess which non-negotiable criterion always appears in the final ruling? Falsifiability.<p>Here is one such ruling (<a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html</a>) -- science must have these properties:<p>1. It is guided by natural law;<p>2. It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;<p>3. It is testable against the empirical world;<p>4. Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and<p>5. It is falsifiable.<p>I bring up this law to make perfectly clear that falsifiability, empirical evidence, and the other standard requirements for science, are only red herrings to people who think they can define science any way they please. For a scientist, obviously this kind of argument is unnecessary -- they already understand what science requires.<p>> What is correct is that experimental designs are more or less not possible in behavioural psychology.<p>Wait, what? Because one cannot design reliable experiments in psychology, therefore psychology is scientific? On what basis -- that real science is too difficult?<p>> This could be OP&#x27;s second point of confusion.<p>The only confusion is yours.",1392536142
7246952,comment,7246746,7246746,29,0,tolmasky,,,"Do you want to be able to pass in Team for every function that currently asks for List<T>? Because that is what you are stating through the act of subclassing. At some point some part of your program may have a List<T>, but <i>actually</i> have a Team.<p>For starters, most teams I know don&#x27;t have cloning technology, and thus can&#x27;t have the same member of a team multiple times, but List<T> absolutely allows this. There are no restrictions on uniqueness in a List<T>. So then you may proceed to override Add() to first check if the team member is already in the team:<p><pre><code>    void Add(Player aPlayer)\n    {\n        if (Contains(aPlayer))\n            return;\n    \n       base.Add(aPlayer);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWonderful! But now you&#x27;re a List<T> by name only, because you don&#x27;t actually behave like a List. You don&#x27;t follow the most basic postcondition of the API. Every single method that adds an item to a List<T> expects the List<T> to be 1 item larger afterward. So basically, you&#x27;ve created a List<T> that has undefined behavior with every existing function that ever calls Add(), because it <i>doesn&#x27;t work the way it was originally sold as working</i>, so what is the point of going around calling yourself a List? You are a crash waiting to happen. You are not a List, you are a <i>list manager</i>.<p>Now is when someone will probably say, no no no. Subclassing isn&#x27;t the problem. The problem is you didn&#x27;t subclass <i>the right thing</i>. You should have subclassed Set<T>. Because teams don&#x27;t have a natural ordering and contain unique players. But now you&#x27;re just going to run into new problems. Like the fact that you have to check if a player is first in a sane state before adding them:<p><pre><code>    void Add(Player aPlayer)\n    {\n        if (aPlayer.team != null)\n            return; // need to be a free agent!\n\n        base.Add(aPlayer);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWe can argue whether this should throw, or whether it should do it unconditionally, but the point is that the virtue of needing logic means its not this thing, its something <i>managing</i> this thing. Someone already wrote Set<T> and List<T> code that was almost certainly smarter than you. You wouldn&#x27;t go poking around their original source to make your program a tiny bit easier to write at risk of ruining other things, so subclassing it is just a way of cheating and only poking around their source only for specific instances, but still causing all the same potential problems for those instances.<p>Remember, you should ask yourself <i>&quot;Can I guarantee every function that expects a T to behave exactly the same way when I pass a P instead (where P is a subclass of T)?&quot;</i>. Almost always the answer is NO, since that&#x27;s why you subclassed it to begin with! So you shouldn&#x27;t do it. If the answer is YES, then you&#x27;ve probably only added an ivar or new methods in which case its equivalent to composition. The only thing subclassing gives you over composition is the ability to modify the behavior of existing methods, which breaks contracts with every other part of the code.",1392536072

Could you please enable two things for those of us who understand security issues and want better security:<p>1- Give me the option to not use my email as the login user id.<p>I&#x27;ve warmed-up to the idea of using randomized user names on sites that allow it.  Something like &quot;aoc4sour*!Z&quot;.  On such sites I have completely different and randomly generated user id&#x27;s and passwords.  Pretty much impossible for an intruder to associate those accounts with any other accounts.<p>...unless...<p>They can access personal information such as real name, email, mailing address, phone and other personal identifying data that could contribute towards social engineering into other sites.<p>hence...<p>2- Please enable an option to choose two factor authentication.<p>This should be there as a firewall to access any personal data at all, even email and real name.  It should also be required for any financial transaction, including pledging any amount on a project.<p>I&#x27;d say make it optional because the less informed (or less paranoid) might not want to bother.<p>finally...<p>3- I love questions such as &quot;What&#x27;s the name of your first pet?&quot;.  How about some of those?<p>I am being a bit sarcastic here.  When answered honestly these questions are really dangerous.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of social engineering to figure out most of them when armed with enough personal data.<p>However, I like to answer such questions with a random set of words.  So, the name of my first pet might be &quot;blue ladder tent aquifer&quot;.  In other words, pretty much impossible to guess even if I gave you access to my facebook and linkedin accounts.<p>When used in this fashion these questions, I think, are actually useful.  I&#x27;d venture to guess that most people don&#x27;t do it this way because they don&#x27;t understand the implications of providing straight answers.<p>These kinds of breaches have been accelerating.

But it was not all mental work. I probably spent about 8 hours a day on software development and then I wehnt home and worked another 8 hours in my half acre of gardens, 3 acre asparagus field or shoveling the daily snowfall of 6 inches or so, off my 100 yard driveway. Not to mention sawing and splitting a few cords of firewood to heat the house, cutting Christmas trees to sell.<p>The physical work was energizing after a day spent writing software, and the mental work was energizing after all the physical labor that I had done the day before. I&#x27;m not saying that the physical labor made me more productive at developing software, although that may be true. But I think that when people count hours and then try to use that to prove a point, they forget to classify what is being done in those hours.<p>Case in point. When I have a tough coding problem, I don&#x27;t slog away at it for extra hours. I go sit in a different chair, stare out the window, look at the cloud shapes, then close my eyes and think of absurd ways to solve the problem. Now if I would include that time in my count of hours per day and tell you that I can regularly put in a 10 hour day, you would be misled. The total hours are not as important as what you do with those hours.<p>If you are going to play on the net for 20 hours a week, then yeah, you may need to put in a full 60 hours. Or you could stop goofing around and do your work. Pay attention to your productivity. Split your day into chunks, take your coffee and lunch breaks. I used to join the smokers on their smoke breaks even though I didn&#x27;t smoke because it got me out of the chair, moving around, and I got to stand in the fresh air and sunshine (upwind of course). And I almost always go for a walk at lunchtime. This is not a waste of time. These pauses are essential for you to get your maximum mental effort.<p>Sure, sometimes you get stuck into a problems and go for hours without leaving the chair. Even if you are 50 you can do that once in a while if you eat healthy (read Joel Fuhrman), but the key here is &quot;once in a while&quot;. Once in a while you can pull out all the stops, but like heroin, it does not get better by doubling the dose.<p>Buddha had it right when he said (and I paraphrase him) &quot;All things in Moderation&quot;.

I&#x27;m not sure how practical it will be as the author has mentioned it&#x27;s currently capable of printing 1 char/5-7 seconds. So that might be too slow. But kudos to him to develop a solution; to think out of the box. Kudos to Lego to offer a tool to let dreamers build.",1392534430

You perform lookups on a live object.</i><p>It has proven nothing of the short. For one, other languages have done it before (and much better, like Smalltalk). Second, it&#x27;s not something that, in Python&#x27;s implementation, makes it particularly suited or pleasant for large codebases.<p>><i>e.g) to use our SessionInterface, your custom session has to provide get_session and save_sesion methods.</i><p>So, relegate work that the computer can do to the programmer. Make him do tedious and error-prone housekeeping.<p>The rest of the comment reads like a teenager&#x27;s attempt at sounding like &quot;cool&quot; and in the know. Things line &quot;JavaicMentalMasturbationBase&quot;, &quot;create a sub-par language and name it after Java&quot;, &quot;Java idiots&quot; and the like.<p>I assure you that there are Java developers who run circles around whatever your coding skills are.

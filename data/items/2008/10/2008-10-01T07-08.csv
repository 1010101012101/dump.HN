320494,comment,320355,320355,0,0,abijlani,,,"First you have to see if the criticism is constructive or destructive. If it is destructive eg. ""Your idea sucks!"". Well then just ignore it. You have to develop a bit of a thick skin and ignore the naysayers and the ones who want to put you done. If the criticism is constructive then make sure you understand what needs to be done or how you can use it to your advantage.<p>In my experience being a solo founder is very tough because you have to keep yourself motivated. Having a partner helps so that you can take turns at picking each other up when times get tough.",1222847478

320485,comment,320355,320355,0,0,LPTS,,,"I approach criticism critically.  Then I usually decide the person criticizing me is an idiot, the wrong person to talk to, or that they had something useful to say.  When people criticize me, it doesn't make me feel down.  It makes me feel smarter or at least ahead of the curve around my ideas, some of the time, and lets me learn something useful the rest of the time.<p>You sound like you are running a neuro-semantic loser script about your project.  That's not the way to change the world.  You can't play this game if you care that much about what eight douchebags who happen to know you think.  Instead of ""criticism is a downer"" try substituting ""criticism is a valuable chance to play a mental game with my ideas""<p>You should lose the depressed downer reaction right away.  Then, you should think about the criticism, and if it's useful, don't be so arrogant that you don't take it.  If it's not useful, either they are stupid or just not relevant.  Either way, nothing to be depressed about.  Or, maybe you actually are a loser and just are in a state of cognitive denial about what a loser situation you are in, I don't know.<p>(You could give your framework to communities all over the country who do similar community reporting.)",1222846822

320481,comment,320206,320206,0,0,il,,,"Either get ready to spend money doing traditional advertising, or go blackhat.<p>""Going viral"" is a myth. The majority of the spontaneous viral hits in the past few years have been carefully planned and executed. Stories get to the Digg front page mostly through coordinated armies of professional Diggers or extensive friend networks. Bloggers take money for undisclosed paid reviews. And don't get me started on email marketing :)<p>I know because I've had a hand in all of that stuff. I've done it, and it works.<p>So, you are faced with a choice: whitehat or blackhat?
Whitehat, start doing some traditional marketing- do some basic market segmentation, see what your competitors are doing, target ""customers"" etc, and then start buying ads- links, paid search, etc or else promoting on the sites your target market uses.<p>Blackhat, do blackhat SEO- spam blogs/forums, get links, cloak, etc.<p>Of course, a simple web app may not merit such extensive investment of time and effort, but the difference between a web app and a funded startup is fuzzy at best.",1222846741

320463,comment,319780,320458,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"I doubt most people on HN are in the lower 95% ;)<p>I'd say its more a matter of dedication and the sheer amount of time I've spent on it, plus the fact that I was able to skip a whole lot of it by basing my earlier insights off those of others rather than trying the (utterly hopeless) strategy of learning it all myself from the spec.<p>I'd also say the ""math-heavy"" is rather exaggerating it; the entire spec has not an ounce of math in it.  All the numerical computations are written in pseudocode, not formulas; its basically written as if a computer was reading it instead of a human.  Personally I have found this to be a rather terrible attribute, as it makes some of it nearly completely incomprehensible.<p>I also find this approach is often the kind of thing that leads people to assume they cannot do something; they think that only ""really smart"" people can possibly do some particular thing, and refuse to try as a result.  Of course, it can also go the other way--because someone does something hard, they insist that they must be really smart, or else they couldn't have done it.  This only reinforces the problem.<p>There also seems to be the rather misleading assumption that younger people are somehow less smart on average, and thus if a younger person does something hard, they must be even smarter than they would be assumed to be otherwise.  I find this to be completely false; I don't think I've gotten one ounce better at math than I was in middle school, for example.  People get more experienced, wiser and more knowledgeable, but I don't think they get much smarter.<p>Though, ironically, I don't actually think I am <i>that</i> smart; if grades are any indication, my last semester is clear proof that I'm not ;)",1222844929

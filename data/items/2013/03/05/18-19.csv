5326547,comment,5325491,5325491,2,0,rcconf,,,"The way I do my TDD is by writing the unit tests to specifically test the functionality of the code.<p>For example, if I'm writing a module that does validation for a specific type (for example, in JS) I tend to test the functionality while writing the tests. I am unable to speak amongst others, but you have to test your code eventually, and it's either going to be in the classes that are using the code, the REPL, or it's going to be in your unit test/integration framework. I usually pick the test framework first because it serves 2 benefits:<p>1) I can prove my code works. (I must prove this to my self, or the people using the code at some point.)<p>2) I can reliably change the code later.<p>Complexity is also mentioned in a couple of comments here. TDD helps simplify complexity by writing code that is testable. It also makes you think about your API as you're writing the different possibilities the module/code can be used in.<p>Further, I think there are multiple issues with tests, and depending on the type of test your doing, different problems can arrise. You have your unit tests, and then you have your integration tests.<p>Unit tests are relatively easy to write (if your code is split into individual chunks, that do a specific task.) and they should always be written regardless of the time you have.<p>I think the major issues arrise in terms of time are the integration tests. When you're testing the functionality between complicated modules that require databases, i/o writes, network communication, it is sometimes hard to write the tests, and it may not even be worth it.<p>The majority of people who disregard TDD, usually disregard a specific sub-problem of TDD. I think TDD has its benefits depending on what type of tests you're doing, and how easily the problems can be solved with those types of tests. You can always pick to write unit tests, and disregard integration tests, etc.<p>I think there are a lot more issues to expand upon, like the language you're using, the platform you're using and how often your code is required to change, but TDD has large benefits, and code rot is very real and TDD can help mitigate it.",1362509964

See John Carmack's recent article on latency mitigation for VR headsets[1][2] for a very detailed example of this issue.  Similar ideas also apply to touch[3][4] and even good old keyboard & mouse input schemes.  There's a tradeoff between ""perfect"" frames and latency (see Carmack's post).

5326534,comment,5322340,5322494,3,0,geebee,,,"It's not that surprising when you consider the focus of the survey.  The times discounts undergraduate admissions.  If you look at the strength and breadth of PhD programs, Berkeley probably does have a very slight edge over Stanford, though at that point it has more to do with research focus.  I'm actually more surprised with how low UMich's ranking is, since it also shows the typical ""public research university"" pattern of ranking much higher at the graduate/department level than the undergrad, largely due to in-state admissions quotas and a larger undergraduate population.<p>Another thing to keep in mind when looking at these rankings... UCSF ranks 40th.  This has nothing to do with the quality of UCSF as a research institution, it's because UCSF is a health sciences campus.  It's not exclusively a med school - there are PhD programs as well, but there are no undergraduates and by design it is not a general research university (there is no electrical engineering or history department).  UCSF is definitely not the 40th ranked medical research institution (it probably has a claim on the top spot).  This is probably the best illustration of how distorted rankings can get.<p>Similarly, Berkeley and many other campuses (MIT, for instance) don't have med schools, which affects their numbers.<p>As usual, rankings are fun, and they aren't useless.  If a university ranks high on this list, that's a pretty good sign that it is a well regarded research institution.  But as a ""score card"", it's not especially useful.  Seventh place vs tenth place probably doesn't have much meaning.",1362509820

5326525,comment,5325257,5325257,14,0,cletus,,,"I have to admit that I'm really on the fence about Haskell. My major gripe with this point I think is point (3).<p>Haskell has (IMHO) gone down a similar road to Scala. Scala has literally tied itself into knots to make statically typesafe collections (amongst other things). I see parallels with Haskell (maintaining functionality purity but dealing with the ""outside world"" through monads).<p>I'm not saying this is wrong. What I am saying is that the gap between making something 99% consistent and 100% consistent is often huge in terms of complexity. This is why I think the so-called mixed paradigm languages (Python, Ruby, even C#) have done so well since you can use these programming models while still writing easy-to-understand imperative code.<p>This is also why I'm so bullish on the future of Go. Someone wrote a book called Learning Go that tells you most of what you need to know and you can knock that out in an afternoon. Go has a good model for parallel programming and a simple syntax. It has made the choice of simplicity over completeness (eg no ""generics"").<p>The net effect is that Haskell will never be mainstream (IMHO) because it's too complex whereas Go probably will be because it's incredibly simple.<p>We've had complex functional languages (eg Lisp) for decades. Yet they haven't gone mainstream. You have to ask yourself why. Some pride themselves in using something so esoteric. Others attribute the lack of popularity to poor marketing or bad timing. The answer is (again, IMHO) is that simplicity matters.<p>Now it should be noted that we're talking about <i>perceived</i> simplicity. You can write multithreaded code in Java, C or C++ but getting it right is incredibly hard yet it can appear simple. The goal of any language I think should be to narrow or eliminate the gap between <i>perceived</i> simplicity and <i>actual</i> simplicity. IMHO Go does a remarkably good job of this.<p>FWIW Python and Go also play nice with C.<p>It's true functional programming does change the way you think but I think writing idiomatic Python or Ruby will get you much the same benefit at much lower cost.",1362509769

Most TDD advocates seem to be blind to the fact that testing is a terrible way to prove many important properties about software systems, security properties for example.

As I wrote in [1]:<p><i>If all you know about getting your code right is TDD, youll never bet on types or proofs or constructive correctness because you dont know how to place those bets. But those bets are often dirt cheap and pay in spades. If youre not betting on them at least some of the time, whatever you are betting on probably costs more and pays less. You could be doing better.</i><p>So I don't think that TDD is a ""safe"" bet.

There is a lot of research on dealing with that exact issue in this setting.  An old paper that looks at this stuff from an economics/finance perspective is here:<p><a href=""http://weber.ucsd.edu/~hwhite/pub_files/hwcv-077.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weber.ucsd.edu/~hwhite/pub_files/hwcv-077.pdf</a><p>and there's been a lot of research since then.<p>I suspect that the popularity and faddish nature of ""big data"" right now comes from hope that those automation procedures will make it conceptually easier to do data analysis, but I don't really know if it will (and I have some doubts).<p>[1] I am not a big-data person, so anyone more knowledgeable should jump in and correct me.",1362508920

5326341,comment,5325445,5325445,1,0,d0m,,,"Thanks for asking.<p>Here are some ideas associated with their pain points in no particular order.<p>1) I'd like to environment to feel more ""dev"" when I'm in the debug tools. Ctrl-L should clear the console, C-a should get to the beginning, etc. Ideally, there should be standard console mode (Vim-like, Emacs-like) so programmers can feel more at home while in the firefox console. There should also be a way, maybe a json file a-la sublime, to tweak the debugging tools. That way, I could tweak the appearance, tweak the hotkeys, tweak which tabs are visible, etc.<p>2) I'd like to have plugins that integrate better with the ""main"" firefox tool. For instance, a plugin could create a new tab in the firefox dev console or add features on top of what's already there. I.e. A ""surround"" vim plugin or whatever. That way, existing IDE and other dev tools could integrate with firefox which would make it so much more powerful.<p>2) I'd like to always have the console at the tip of my hand, so it can load ""very"" fast and be non-intrusive. An idea would be to bind it to the ~ key which would popup a transparent console <i>on top</i> of the web page. For instance, I'd type:<p><pre><code>  ~$('.whatever')\n</code></pre>\nwhich would evaluate this and return the result in a tool-tip. It annoys me to death to write things like<p>console.log($('.whatever')).. It should be easier to evaluate things as we write them.<p>i.e.<p><pre><code>  ~$('.whatever')<key to evaluate>.click<key to evaluate (ok good there's the click function)(function() { return 'meh'; }\n  <Actual click on the .whatever link show 'meh'>\n  ~$('.whatever')<key to evaluate>.click<key to evaluate (ok good there's the click function)(function() { return $('.submit-button')<key to evaluate>  } etc, etc.\n</code></pre>\nA little bit like a scheme repl.<p>And I stress the transparent console because it's so annoying to have a big white console take a large portion of the screen even if most of the time you don't have to look at it. Yes, you look at what you're typing, but everything that happened before isn't that much relevant. And if you need it, you can still ""pop"" it for real.<p>3. Firefox needs to be lighter and faster. Maybe on your machine it's fast, but on mine, it's so slow compared to chrome. The main reason I'm not using Firefox for my debugging needs is because I don't use Firefox for normal browsing. It's not just about the page loading.. it's also about the ram footprints and the time it starts. The best analogy I have to explain this is ""Presently, Chrome is to Firefox what Firefox was to Explorer in term of speed"".<p>4. Firefox needs to be prettier. Again, maybe on your machine with I-don't-know-what-you-have-installed Firefox looks nice, but on my Archlinux distribution, it looks awful. Here are two snapshots from Chromium and Firefox (Firefox really looks like netscape 10 years ago)<p><a href=""http://s4.postimage.org/e5zmk1m1n/firefox_netscape.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s4.postimage.org/e5zmk1m1n/firefox_netscape.png</a>\n<a href=""http://s10.postimage.org/4o2te27x5/chromium.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s10.postimage.org/4o2te27x5/chromium.png</a>",1362508245

5326336,comment,5315064,5326106,3,0,tikhonj,,,"It's a red herring because the original claim was not ""Haskell can compute function Java cannot"" but rather ""there are many libraries in Haskell which aren't even possible to write in Java"".<p>The point is that libraries do more than just compute stuff. If all we cared about was what you could compute,  there are plenty of interesting libraries that wouldn't count for anything! Any library exporting new types of control flow, for example.<p>The argument is that there are libraries you can write in Haskell that you can't write in Java. And since libraries can do meta-programming which is possible in Haskell but not in Java, this is accurate. Similarly, since self-modification is something a library can do, possible on one model but not another, it isn't a red-herring.<p>Hmm, how can I make my point clearer? Let me give you a very specific example then: a library with new syntax sugar would be impossible to write in Java. Sure, this does not allow you to compute anything different, but it's still very important and has a practical effect. Let's take a very trivial library of this sort: a library only providing an ""unless"" statement like Perl's. Possible in some languages, not possible in others.<p>Some of the examples in the original post also fall into this category. The lenses library, for example, just allows you to write composable accessors and mutators. It does not compute anything new. But it's still very useful because it makes your code simpler and gives you new ways to express yourself. You could not write anything like it in Java.<p>Hopefully that cleared things up a bit.",1362508182

Without this we can't write proximity-based social apps, a bump-like app for business cards, network aware db sync engine, etc. To continue this line of thinking, it is not always devices that you need your webapp to communicate with.

Even in the presence of such tools, you need a powerful machine to not hate the slowness of the whole thing and worse still, break your flow.<p>My recommendation for someone who hates TDD for the wrong reason, aka: breaking the flow, would be to get a fast machine, fix the code to make TDD as painless as possible and to use the right tools.<p>But once you start using TDD as a tool to organize your thoughts and model your domain, you might end up becoming too dependant on it and find it hard to work any other way. This is anecdotal experience.<p>Also, learning how to wield TDD properly takes a lot of time, error and practice. Good things don't come easy. \nThere are obviously places where TDD isn't a good fit - a spike, requirement that is known in advance to change soon, and exploratory programming are all candidates. However, good practice dictates that you refactor your code once a spike calcifies into production code. At this point, TDD becomes just unit-testing.<p>Most of the arguments against TDD in this thread seems to be against unit testing in general. But we know unit tests are important. Doing it before the fact increases the value of the unit tests manifold and also ensures that you do have coverage (though that is not at a primary objective).",1362506797

There's a glut of skilled writers willing to work for free and a dearth of people willing to pay for journalism, either through subscriptions or advertising. There's an idea that this is the cynical exploitation of journalists by publishers, but that simply wouldn't be possible if demand for writing outstripped supply.</i><p>You are mixing things up. There is a glut of <i>bad</i> writers. There are very few skilled writers. I say this from a writer's perspective.<p>From a business person's perspective, many companies have lowered their expectations with regard to a writer's ability. Why in the world would they do this? This is actually pretty easy. They think they know how ""artists"" and ""writers"" work; they believe they are too slow and worry over superfluous details.<p>Let me first say the problem is less people are spending less money on the arts than, say, 40 years ago. Companies focus on their bottom line, of course. They ask of writers for specific things that will either protect their bottom line or help their visibility (mostly online now).<p>Nate Thayer said it: ""I am sure you can do what is the common practice these days and just have one of your interns rewrite the story as it was published elsewhere, but hopefully stating that is how the information was acquired"". I highly respect Nate Thayer. His display of professionalism and humility is admirable.<p>The company I work for makes me rewrite stories. This is why we do it: SEO keywords increase visibility by adding new/unique content to our site that really didn't originate or isn't unique to the company I work for. It is an easier way to add diverse content and then add the keywords we focus on, apart from the whole Google campaign stuff. We operate thusly because, since I am a writer and hardly anyone thinks we're worth anything, I have many, many, many other tasks that I must do throughout the day unrelated to the act of compelling writing. So I have very little research time and time to let what I write sink in. Therefore, I cannot get to it later after a week with fresh eyes. I am also the only editor and proofreader. This is wrong. I <i>am</i> meticulous. But I work at an actual factory (technically a ""warehouse"") in an industrial city where most companies are wholesalers. This city smells of rotting pig carcass. (Literally, though, which is rather funny-interesting and ironic. And I hesitate to say this, because you will probably now know where I am located.)<p>What has happened is companies, rightly so, get to why they really need the writer for in order to gain visibility and be searchable online. I'm of the opinion that many online places like Huffington Post don't care for what they are actually reporting on. I used to follow them on Twitter and they constantly A/B test articles with different headlines, switching the titles depending on hot or trending keywords. They will write headlines or articles based on trending keywords that will get them the most clicks, not because it provides compelling writing that is needed for us to improve as a society. But now I am imposing my own aesthetic and worldview on what writing should be.<p>I can't say The Atlantic does this, but I look at their headlines carefully and sometimes question their intentions. It's a little harder for me to discern The Atlantic's agenda, though. But the writing industry has made me jaded and sceptical of most online magazines.<p>A good friend studied journalism (I didn't) and they teach him that magazines like The New Yorker, The Atlantic, the NY Times and others no longer provide any real value to the art of journalism. Now it's mostly bloggers (working for free, for the most part) who have more valuable things to say. However, you will always find a couple of writers within large organisations who still offer compelling journalism. This is what makes things a little tricky. We usually follow these few on Twitter instead of visiting the front page of the companies they work for. By doing this, we don't need to rummage through all the trash.<p><i>Personally, I think we'll come to accept the idea that, for the most part, writing is a leisure activity and not a profession. It's not unreasonable to imagine that the profitability of writing and publishing was just a temporary blip, as a result of a peculiar set of technological and economic conditions.</i><p>This doesn't even make sense to me. What are you trying to say? All of writing can be written automatically by drones? Huh? Writing is not all scientistic. It's not all about numbers and data. In some theoretical world, computers may write all types of texts (novels, stories, journalism, etc.) so well we may not distinguish them from human-generated texts, but I am not here to hypothesise.<p>With regard to writing being a leisure activity, the arts have switched back and forth from being entertainment to didactic. The period in history which preceded the Enlightenment period is an example of this. Before the Age of Reason, the arts were seen as entertaining. If you view the arts as historico-cultural movements, you would understand the pendulum has swung back and forth. And my own bias is to think that it will continue being so. In the mid-20th century, I believe both existed almost harmoniusly, but with the creation of the World Wide Web, we seem to be confused as to what is entertaining and what is didactic and their respective values as a society. The whole culture of irony does not help matters either.<p>I don't really understand the whole ""temporary blip"" thing. Care to elaborate? Obviously writing is not just a leisure activity, so you have me ultimately confused. I do believe that the very nature of writing is suberversiveness or experimentation. I find it difficult to fathom that a computer can write something like In Search of Lost Time, and more importantly, I don't know why anyone would prefer to read something similar written by something without a heart.<p><i>Photography is the clear forerunner.</i><p>Photography is palpable. Language deals with meaning, connotations, subtexts, etc., which are all intangible. It is clear when we see a bad photo meant for, say, a travel magazine. It is difficult to find an equivalent in writing.<p><i>The real villains are educational institutions</i><p>I partially agree with this. I think there are good and bad professors in the arts (which I know is not saying much, if anything at all). The bad ones are looking out for themselves, either by just focusing on trying to get published or recruiting easily manipulated or ""lost"" arts students into their master/doctorate degree programme. There are a few who are more idealistic and want to help someone who they think has the potential to have an impact on society by transforming a small part of literature and how writing is perceived. They know the odds are against them and most likely it will never happen, but this is the romanticisation ofacademia and old educational institutions. Incidentally, I've found most of these types of profs teach literature & politics/poli sci, so they emphasise political writing.<p>Just the $0.02 of a rambling writer.",1362506627

For example, the little of feature of having key handlers to jog numeric style properties is huge as it allows you to look at your page and not the value you are changing. Along these lines, here are some things that would go beyond what is currently offered.<p>- Allow me to easily get a diff of the styles that I have changed. I tweak a lot of styles and then I painfully bounce back and forth between my editor trying to make sure I have everything updated. When I forget something, it's lost. (Another angle on this would be to keep a history of the styles that were tweaked so I can get that back after refresh).<p>- You have the beginnings of an awesome z-index debugger with the 3d-view. Make it more interactive. I really want to see the page from the side with the z-index values somehow visible. Debugging z-index issues are a royal pain in the ass and you have a great opportunity to be awesome here.<p>(2) Your network level debugging needs a lot of work to even reach par with WebKit browsers. There is a great opportunity here as well. Even with the features that Chrome offers, I still resort to a debugging proxy for many tasks. Specifically, I use Charles for throttling to test timing on slow networks, replace network resources with a copy on disk (for in the field debugging), visibility into compression and a lot of cache related issues. In fact, tooling that gives visibility into caching behavior would be great. Another area lacking for browsers these days is debugging WebSocket traffic. Chrome's WebSocket visibility doesn't give me the real time visibility I need for message-style traffic.<p>(3) Performance visibility. I worked on the performance related tools in Chrome for a while. In fact, I landed the instrumentation that gave developers visibility into reflow/layout. I want visibility into what is going on in the browser: Reflow, compositing, parsing, HTML tokenization, image decoding, message passing queues. I want to be able to see it all.<p>(4) Expand Scratchpad. I basically want to be able to write a user script without ever having to install anything or open a file. Let me open the scratch pad, write some code and check ""run this when example.com/ loads"". I have a lot of debugging-in-the-field issues where I end up jumping through hoops to get some custom script to run at startup.<p>Ok, that's a quick 4 off the top of my head.

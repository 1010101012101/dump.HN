Once she realized that each finger had 2 states (up or down), she naturally recreated a binary counting system.\nIt's a neat trick, and even comes in handy when trying to keep track of a large count of something.\nWith kids, however, you may end up with behavior problems around the numbers 4 and 132 :)",1302807586

A realistic scenario might be that somebody decides that they want to buy your app and then compares the price at a couple of different app stores and decides to buy it at Amazon because there's a 10% discount but would have otherwise bought it elsewhere. In this case Amazon would have gained profit from the discount while you would have lost it.<p>How this ultimately plays out for the developer is hard to predict because it depends on how the market develops. If the Amazon store becomes very successful and their audience shops there regardless of whether or not there is a discount then this effect will be small. The terms guarantee that users will only find discounts at Amazon and this will make them less likely to check other stores when they find an app at Amazon even if it's full price. If that's how customers behave then the optimization will stay more favorable for the developer.",1302806249

2447841,comment,2446388,2446388,1,0,foob,,,"<i>Amazon steeply discounts a large chunk of its Appstore catalog (imagine: ""our top 100-rated games are all 75% off!""). Some developers will probably win in this scenario, but some developers -- most likely, those near the bottom of the list -- will lose, not gaining enough sales to offset the loss in revenue per sale. Amazon benefits the most, because it captures all the customer goodwill generated by such a promotion.</i><p>There might be some chance of Amazon doing something like this, but it is important to point out that even in this case the developers of those 100 apps will on average be making more money. Amazon is trying to optimize prices to maximize their own profit and in doing so they also increase it for the developer. Lets look at an example...<p>Say that Amazon sells n copies of a game per day at the list price of $1. Then they make .3n dollars per day and the writer of the app makes .7n dollars. Now if they lower the price by 75% like the author suggests and sell m copies per day then the app writer makes .2m dollars and Amazon makes .05m dollars. Moneywise, this obviously only makes sense for Amazon to do if m > n6 because they would be losing money otherwise. If this condition is met then the app writer will make at least .2n6=1.2n that day and their profit increased by at least 71% if Amazon was smart about their decision.<p>As long as Amazon changes a price such that it increases their own gain then it also increases the gain of the developer. In the price range from .2/.7=.286 to 1.0 of the list price this is trivially true because your profits are directly proportional to theirs in that range. In that case you have a minimum increase in profit of 0% but will likely see something higher. In the range from 0.0 to 0.2 of the list price Amazon is losing money to pay you so I'm assuming that this isn't going to happen. In the range of .2 through .286 things get a little more complicated. Look at this plot (<a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot%5B100*%28%28.3%2F%28x-.2%29%29*.2-.7%29%2F.7%2C+{x%2C.20%2C.2%2F.7}%5D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Plot%5B100*%28%28.3%2F%...</a>) which shows the absolute minimum percent increase in profit that the developer sees compared to list price given that Amazon isn't losing money on the decision. If Amazon thinks that it's a good idea to sell your app for 78% off then you're probably about to start making a lot more money than you would otherwise.<p>I understand that at first glance .2 of list price sounds scary, but as I've shown above the developer also makes an increased profit whenever Amazon does. This doesn't totally negate the proposition that Amazon might take a loss on your app to help sales elsewhere but they could just as easily take a loss elsewhere to help sales of your app. On average you'll still be making more money. I've assumed throughout this that Amazon knows how to adjust prices to maximize their own profits but I have a feeling that they're pretty good at this. They have a treasure trove of data on people's shopping habits that I can't even begin to comprehend and they're just trying to apply what they've learned to an app store.<p>tl;dr: The pricing policy actually increases your profits compared to a .7/.3 split at list price as long as Amazon is acting in a way that increases their own profits. It sounds scary at first but it's actually pretty cool that you can have a company as experienced at this stuff as Amazon optimize the price of your app so that you make as much profit as possible.",1302805169

And to top that, the Portland Seed Fund along with most of the other funding networks in Oregon are pay to apply.<p>At a the recent UpdatePDX event[1] one of the comments was ""Several people commented on how lovely Portland was  even in the rain. But damn, they wish they could hire the types of people they needed here.""[2]<p>The conclusion that I keep coming back to seems to be ""There aren't enough people here ready to dive into a startup, yet everyone thinks we need more startups and likes that idea, but we value our quality of life more anyway.""

A number of dialects even played with Algol-like syntax (McCarthy himself had planned to give LISP an Algol-like syntax.  S-Expressions were a fortuitous stopping point on the way to an implementation of so-called M-Expressions which never came).<p>In the writings of the time, I don't see much debate over whether these systems were or were not LISP.  Mostly, people understood this as a big family of languages.<p>In contrast, Common LISP and Scheme not only have much more in common than those LISPs did, in one important regard (lexical scoping), they are closer to each other than they are to the vast majority of historical lisp implementations.  The only reason we're asking this question is because after the fading away of other historical LISP dialects, the differences between Scheme and Common LISP seem bigger than they are.<p>So yeah, I'd say Scheme is LISP.<p>(By the way, two great looks at the LISP family tree are The Evolution of Lisp[1] by Guy L. Steele and Richard Gabriel, and Olin Shivers' History of T[2], an early dialect of Scheme with an extensible version of set! similar to Common Lisp's SETF)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/HOPL2-Uncut.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/HOPL2-Uncut.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html</a>",1302804903

Also, explaining to support or other users on forum that your copy is actually legit only worsens the pain.<p>- Operation: Flashpoint was much worse. First of all, single player works as expected.

What you are really buying yourself with the 6% of your company are 4 fundamental things:\n- Data Points in the Market\n- Social Proof\n- Network For Fund Raising and Exposure\n- Great, Super Driven, Smart Friends (other founders)<p>Data Points in the Market:\nWith data points I mean advice. As a founder of your company you are staring at your problem for too long. You forget to think outside the box. Feedback and advice from an experienced PM/Hacker/Founder help you avoid mistakes. But be aware, each advice no matter who it comes from is just ONE data point in the market. You need to collect many of them and then decide for yourself and for your company what is best. AngelPad with its 5 mentors, helps you get direct/fast access to these data points on a weekly basis.<p>Social Proof:\nBeing part of AngelPad and getting through the application process (4% roughly get accepted) is social proof. Potential future employees or investors see this as validation that you are smart because someone already did the homework/reference checks for them.<p>Network For Fund Raising and Exposure:\nThe amount of intros they can make to investors is amazing. We got 20 meetings lined up with top angels and VCs in no time.<p>Great, Super Driven, Smart Friends (other founders):\nLast but not least, all the other founders are super helpful, friendly and in a nutshell just an awesome environment to be in. They are all super driven and smart. Value this relationship. Stay in touch with them. Make an effort to connect. These are the people are your first users, the first ones who recommend you and the first ones who make an effort to comment/help you with your product.",1302804216

(defn name [arg1 arg2] body).  Lists are not the alpha and omega like they are in LISPs.<p>But I agree it has &quot;every single characteristic that defines a lisp&quot;, even if it looks funny to experienced Lispers like myself.<p>Aesthetically I much prefer standard LISP syntax + indentation , but 100% support the use of literals for the non-list data structures.  Many disagree on the syntax, and if no longer having a sea of pure parens brings more adaptation I&#x27;m willing to live with it.  I got the impression the syntax changes were due to that reason vs. inspiration from ML, but I&#x27;m not at all sure about that.  Still, Rich Hickey is an experienced Lisper with exquisite taste below the level of syntax, so I&#x27;m pretty sure he was aware of the implications of his syntax changes.",1376150102

A single Frankfurter will not alter your health, but if you open up the possibility of eating them you need to wonder - Is one per day OK? what about one per week? If you eat a hamburger does that mean you can&#x27;t eat a Frankfurter for two days etc. etc..

Just replacing names and addresses with tokens that don&#x27;t identify the specific subjects would get you most of the way there unless the specific fact pattern is unique to the suspect, and then you can redact what is necessary to make it less specific.<p>In addition to that, once any given investigation is over the opinions and redactions that were held secret for the purposes of that investigation should be published, and it shouldn&#x27;t be so easy to keep things secret for decades just by making a facile claim of national security.<p>>9/11 only involved boxcutters, but I&#x27;d say that it presented a rather significant national security problem when those turned out to be sufficient to hijack planes and fly them into high-value targets.<p>9/11 was not a national security problem. 9/11 was a mass murder. It was shocking but we have inflicted more damage on ourselves in our overreaction to it than the terrorists did in committing it. More have died avenging the victims of 9/11 than died on 9/11.<p>A national security threat is a nuclear bomb, or a plague, or a foreign government infiltrating high level government offices in preparation for some kind of Communist takeover. Something that would be a factor of 1000 worse than 9/11 and present an actual threat to the security of the entire nation. This watering down of &quot;national security threat&quot; to mean any jerk who might kill some people with an IED is just a ruse to rationalize the use of extremist measures against everyone rather than taking into account the proportionality of the threat.<p>>You&#x27;re also ignoring the fact that many kinds of low-level terrorist activity aren&#x27;t open to direct investigation by law enforcement. For example, suppose you pick up signals about a plot involving Mr X, who has not yet arrived in the US but whose phone number you have managed to identify. If he&#x27;s in a country that&#x27;s friendly to the US you might be able to get their law enforcement people to investigate him, but if not then it&#x27;s logical to monitor who he communicates with for prophylactic purposes.<p>So get a warrant and conduct surveillance on him then.

After all, if discrete logarithms are ever broken, it&#x27;ll likely be by academic researchers.<p>Diffie-Hellman is based on discrete logarithms, but RSA is not. RSA is based on integer factorization, not discrete logarithms. Integer factorization and discrete logarithms share some common techniques, but neither is known to be based on the other, and opinion is split as to whether they are truly equivalent. I can&#x27;t think of a single respectable academic researcher who thinks that the latest results threaten RSA.<p>The new discrete logarithm attacks require the existence of a nontrivial intermediate subfield, and work best in small characteristic. They do not apply to the most common instances of Diffie-Hellman in deployment (no subfields, large characteristic), and we currently have no realistic approaches that could make them apply. A similar story actually played out with ECC some 10-15 years ago, when Weil descent attacks were new. Those attacks on ECC also require an intermediate subfield, and 10 years of follow-on research has been unable to sidestep this requirement. To date, there is no indication that Weil descent can be used on the most common instances of ECC being deployed today, and nobody is going around saying ECC is at risk from new algorithms. (Quantum computers, yes, but not new algorithms.)<p>It is possible that the new discrete logarithm attacks will extend to cases with large characteristic and no intermediate subfields, but I personally think that it is extremely unlikely. I would not put the chances at &quot;small but definite.&quot; It would be a major surprise if this happened. Even if it did, RSA may still be safe. I can&#x27;t speak for others, but my sense of the crypto community is that most experts agree with my assessment.&quot;",1376148793

So how to choose among this equivalence class? Choose the one with the best possible network! That&#x27;s why Harvard and Yale unbeatable, and depending on where you want to go Stanford. The alumni network&#x27;s distribution within the American workspace is key, not only because those will be your future classmates but also because that&#x27;s how will perceive you. Why so many important people from Harvard Law School, just because it&#x27;s hard to get into?<p>This may be a simplistic approach but at least it gives you actionable items for your decision, I think. BTW, I&#x27;m no expert either, I got my degrees from Purdue. <i>My</i> decision process was simple: choose the only American university that gave me admission and TAship.",1376147637

If the precise usage of all web APIs could be inferred from the verb <i>alone</i>, presumably all web APIs are exactly the same.  That&#x27;s nonsensical.  I challenge anybody to honestly claim they have consumed a 3rd party web API of material complexity without once referring to the documentation and solely relying on guessing HTTP verbs.<p>Once you&#x27;re already reading the API documentation, I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d prefer &quot;http.request(&#x27;PUT&#x27;, &#x27;/resource&#x27;)&quot; over &quot;http.post(&#x27;/resource/put&#x27;).  Even better, you can choose a URI that makes the most sense to your domain model, e.g. &#x27;/resource/upload&#x27;.  I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d want to have less expressive URIs AND more work.  In even this simple example, the verb is unlikely to be adequate in any case - if you need to supply options or metadata the verb is even less significant as to the true meaning of the operation.<p>The fact is you can always embed the verb of your choice into the URI - thereby making a GET/POST/HEAD world no more or less expressive than a Verbtopia world.  All that extra verbs do is cause consumers of the API to have to remember two pieces of information (VERB + URI) rather than one (URI).  At least URIs can be constructed to make as much semantic sense as possible within a given domain model - VERBs, on the other hand, end up as square pegs in round holes, making them far less memorable.",1376147015

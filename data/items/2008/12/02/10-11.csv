Having seen how tricky it can be to build a reliable protocol that provides congestion control and is fair to everyone, I wouldn't count on anyone getting it right without very serious effort.",1228215171
382887,comment,382250,382701,0,0,bk,,,"Many use cases remain (and will remain for a long time) where having a network-based application is not practical.<p>This doesn't even necessarily depend much on technological advances, as it does on geographical and social factors.<p>Examples:<p>* I sit on a train that goes through valleys and tunnels - there is simply no reception (not even cell) of any kind in those areas in most cases.<p>* I keep all my data online in Google apps, but I get locked out of my account (as reported a few weeks ago on HN).<p>* I have huge amounts of data (HD video), my uplink sucks and will suck for a long time. It sucks even more when I travel.<p>* I'm in China and access a European site, which is routed through North America - I get at least half a second of latency on every request. Ouch.<p>If you ask me, I see the trend going more towards smaller devices and improved online-offline capabilities. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point you could ""download"" (or call it ""permanently cache"") google docs' actual software at and use it completely offline, with a convenient auto-update and remote data syncing option. (Evernote might be an example of ""the future"").<p>The ideal situation for most users is to have their data (and accessing software) available locally and remotely.",1228214970

What would make this more useful for me is a simple URL that I can use to access my list anytime, ie:<p><a href=""http://www.wipeelist.com/list/MYUSERNAME"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wipeelist.com/list/MYUSERNAME</a><p>All you need from people is that username. Just make the lists public and writable by default and ask users for a password/email if they want to make their lists private.<p>Also, I didn't see the ""Add an Item"" right away. Perhaps I am blind. I'd suggest you add an onclick javascript event in the GIANT WHITESPACE that takes up most of the screen when you login. I clicked on the blank space expecting something to happen. It would have been nice if something did happen.<p>Third, it would be nice to be able to rearrange items by dragging them around. There are jquery plugins for that (Sortables) and is it not hard to implement them.",1228214089

382870,comment,382863,382863,0,0,bdfh42,,,"Just musing bit: I wonder about the power of narrative.<p>I do not mean the narrative style of TV shows like CSI and NCIS where they can ""enhance"" a single pixel into a recognisable face or number plate - rather the narrative of a sequence of transactions. Can a sequence tell a story that leads to comprehension - or at least to reduced false positives?<p>We know that Bayesian SPAM filters need to keep track of the new stories arriving in our email in-boxes as the SPAM and fraud ""pitches"" evolve over time - seems to me we should be able to do something similar with transactions - we just need to find a narrative (or some other less than perfect understanding) in any given sequence.",1228213018

I think the bigger story here is that despite all the advantages that they had, in this climate it failed.<p>Interestingly however DropBox has seemingly been a success which I believe offers a more targeted solution to the problem (file transfer), rather than trying to be all things to all people. If there is a lesson to be learned here I would have thought it was that. Like 37signals often says, try to do one thing really well. Don't try to offer too many features etc. and dilute your product into yet another (I got that feature too). That seems to be the mistake of Pownce.",1228212266

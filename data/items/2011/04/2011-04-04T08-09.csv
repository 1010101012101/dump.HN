Not surprising given the similarity between the two countries (though I note there are also some significant differences as well). Probably the most notable is the relatively small population compared to say the US. You'd think Canada actually has the greater advantage though.<p>What annoys me the most, however, is that the US and Australian governments allegedly signed a free trade agreement. Copyright laws were altered here to be more compatible with the US, though it has certainly not altered the extortion sought by distributors. Many US e-commerce sites including Amazon for non-book/dvd products won't post to Australia. I'm pretty sure they'll post to US territories such as Guan which isn't far off the Australian coast. Close enough that some Australian company run fibre there, to take advantage of surplus capacity they had. So free trade agreements don't really change much for consumers it seems (however, it should in theory reduce barriers for Australian companies to sell in the US and vice versa).",1301907380

Or even more concisely, ""be realistic"".<p>I don't think this is invalid, but at the same time, it seems like it's suggesting that, rather than searching for a need you want solved and framing it in terms of a realistic goal and whittling it down to a compelling product, you should be identifying someone else's need and building <i>that</i> product.<p>A fun idea without a plan may need some serious thought and modifications to make it a compelling product, but I think that perhaps a compelling idea with no fun is pretty difficult to <i>make</i> fun.<p>Perhaps my core philosophical objection can be summarized in contrast to this:<p>> Any sufficiently big market will give you tons of interesting ideas. Why do you need to come up one of your own?<p>I don't think this is a market-driven approach, in the sense that the market is merely setting the context, and it's still interest-driven, and you're still searching (and hopefully coming up with) ideas you find interesting.

It is especially true if it is not your first programming language, so you don't need all the ""algorithm"" stuff, and are just looking for a quick reference, some idioms, and a lot of code examples.<p>The only issue with the stuff you find online is that there seldom is a unique comprehensive source of information. You often have to jump between different tutorials in order to grasp certain concepts (can't help to mention the concept of monads in Haskell, which is a perfect illustration of what I'm saying).<p>So I'm not surprised that a tutorial covering many topics got so many hits..<p>> .. or charge about $1<p>Doesn't sound like a good idea. The problem is not with the price, but with the effort required to pay. I don't have a paypal account, and I don't plan to get one just to buy a tutorial, when I have tons of other ressources online.

</code></pre>
As an anonymous commenter has already pointed out, with the possible exception of some parts of MSR, there aren't any industrial labs where you can ""do whatever the hell you want"". I was offered a position at IBM research and they were very clear from the outset that they had a specific set of projects they wanted me to work on. In fact, these projects had less to do with my research work at grad school and more to do with what I'd done in my previous life as a software developer. These sense I got from talking to the researchers at IBM was there is a clear expectation that IBM research would directly impact the company's bottomline. The group I was to be recruited into was helping solve some of the hard problems that the rest of the organization simply doesn't have the expertise to solve.<p>I dunno about other fields but in my area of work, which is computer architecture, MSR, Intel and IBM have all written important papers that have directly influenced the design of many current-generation microprocessors. So, I'm a bit hesitant to suggest that the labs have failed or that the model is broken. The model could do with some improvement for sure, but then again, what couldn't?",1301906819

PayPal doesn't really trust you: subscriptions are limited to one year in length, but you have the control of when and how much is billed (within limits of the ""preapproval"").

While I don't play violin, my wife's a composer (and plays viola & cello), and that 'electric violin' portion of the video was probably the most cringe-worthy part of the video.<p>I agree.<p>I'm a musician and compose. I also used to do live performances and loops in my more ""experimental"" music. This is an expensive toy for such limited use.<p>His target audience can't be classical musicians, because of all the nuances that go into physically playing an instrument. It doesn't take a lot of knowledge to realize this, so it makes me wonder why he or who in the world would suggest this. I've played simple virtual instruments and VSTs like this, and the dynamic range and capability is extremely limited. The only virtual piano I would play would be Synthogy Ivory. The keyboard on the Invisible Instrument app  didn't even have more than one octave, as far as I was able to see.<p>Students wanting to learn an instrument would be hindered by this. Just for string instruments, learning how to tune and hold it, posture and the tactile dynamics is a world of difference. This toy would only contribute to acquiring bad habits, as you can tell when the creator begins to ""play"" the violin. Having said that, why would this app be for classical musicians?<p>If he incorporates a looping device or a sequencer into it, there might be a use for this within the rock/hobbyist/experimental crowd.<p>I don't like saying this, because it probably sounds really pretentious and/or condescending, but this is most likely for the non-musician; the person who is not interested in music. That is, it's meant for the person who has some spare time and spare money, or kids who get money from their parents and don't mind spending their money mindlessly.<p>Lastly, I think the only positive I can see in this is that it might be able to teach you theory. Otherwise, once you factor in the cost of the Wii Remote, it's an expensive toy that doesn't do much except trigger cheesy synthy sounds through Bluetooth.",1301905053

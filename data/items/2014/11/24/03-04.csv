This has nothing to do with the absolute density of jobs in the region. And, by the way, the salaries attached to over 90% of the listings I see (by region/role only--no filter for compensation or anything else) are a joke <i>especially</i> in Silicon Valley, even for startups (which typically offer low salary to begin with), although the equities are, sadly, not terribly out of line.",1416801585

If this is not managed, and old compiled binaries of the version control system disappear from existence, then it may become impossible to recover the old sources.<p>Thus, successfully self-hosting a version control system is some measure of evidence that the developers know what they are doing and can manage the changes.

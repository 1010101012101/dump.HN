I disagree with a bunch of things in it, but regardless of that, I feel vindicated in this thread for prying it out of you. =)<p>Serial numbers: I'm not sure if BIND 9 just made this problem go away, but back in the dark ages when I managed BIND for a couple thousand zones, you had to manually bump the serial for every change you made. AXFR relies on the serial in the SOA to decide whether to propagate a change.<p>Performance: I think people are way out of whack on the performance implications of DNS. I've spent years hammering DNS servers, and while it's true that BIND 8's terrible memory management will drag down the performance of the rest of a server, the actual request latency BIND adds answering queries is so low that you can use it to statistically detect whether sniffers are running, as a proxy for user->kernel latency (which shoots up when your ethernet device takes the hardware MAC address filters off to go into promiscuous mode). So, for whatever it's worth: I don't buy that there are serious performance problems with server selecton.<p>Supporting djbdns: meh, I was curious, not challenging you. Obviously don't do it if your customers aren't asking you. You're wrong about the security implications of BIND, though.<p>Thanks again for replying in such detail.",1256151025

The high price is largely due to the need to pay off education loans. Physicians commonly finish training $200K+ in debt. Even if there were more physicians, they would have to charge almost as much just to make ends meet. To solve that you first need to find a way to cut the price of education.<p>2. Very few people want to be physicians, and fewer still have the intelligence and talent to do it well. Treatment by a quack is often worse than no treatment at all.<p>3. The only way to get a lot more physicians in to industrialized countries is through immigration from developing countries. However the political climate has turned against immigration (I think that's a bad change, but it's unlikely to reverse any time soon). And importing physicians leaves those developing countries bereft of medical care they desperately need.<p>4. Most physicians already work long hours. You can't squeeze much more out of them.

895267,comment,894706,895154,0,0,frig,,,"If we're talking about mass-producing medicine you need more physicians at some point.<p>Your larger points may hold but I think you're underestimating the need for more physicians in the future.<p>There's firstly the obvious aging-population demographic; the older people get the more health care they'll want and thus if you hold the population of physicians constant (as a % of the overall populace) the demands upon the for physicians' attention will become greater as time moves forward; you might say ""so hire more nurse practitioners!"" but I suspect that won't be the answer, and I think that'll be clear after the next point.<p>The second point is that as medical knowledge has increased over the years medicine itself has gotten much more complicated. Problems that had no answer can now be examined and more-complicated disease mechanisms and cross-interactions (etc.) can be looked at. This is particularly true in gerontological settings -- old people have lots of problems mutually-compounding each other -- but it's complicated problems aren't the unique purview of the elderly.<p>To practice future medicine well will require more time and attention on the physician's part; getting that time back in the face of increasing demand for physician's time probably requires more physicians, doing more-thorough work on fewer patients.<p>And even in the present day most major teaching hospitals only really get by by slave-driving their residents; get rid of the residents and there's not enough doctors available at prices the institutions can afford to keep the hospitals working at full capacity.",1256148848
895265,comment,894746,894959,0,0,btilly,,,"I've seen the claims that a pure cash investing strategy has a track record as good as the US stock market over very long periods of time.  I've looked into them.  They are wrong.<p>The basis of the claim is the stock market index.  You look at where it was at one time, look at where it was another, then figure out the effective interest rate between them.  And lo and behold, at the bottom of the crash that interest rate was not very good!<p>The problem with this claim is that the indexes just aggregate stock prices.  But companies frequently pay dividends.  When a company pays a dividend, the stock price drops by the value of the dividend.  This money is not lost though, it is returned to the investor for cash and is free to be reinvested.<p>When you add back the dividends, stocks perform <i>much</i> better than they do when you don't.  As an extreme illustration, look at the DOW through the Great Depression.  Before the crash the DOW hit a peak of 381.17.  It then crashed and did not return to that peak until November 23, 1954.  So it looks like you lost money for decades.  But the classic <i>How to Buy Stocks</i> looked at how investments would do if you reinvested dividends.  That story is very different.  Over many decades they could not find a 5 year period in which the stock market lost money, or a 10 year period in which you made less than 7%/year, compounding annually.  (The worst period was actually the early 70s.)<p>Now how realistic is that analysis?  If the money is in a tax sheltered retirement plan, very.  If the money is not tax sheltered, then you're going to be taxed on your dividends, and your returns are going to suffer.  (But you're also going to be taxed on returns in a money only strategy.)  Working out the full details is very complex.  But no matter how you look at it, there is no lengthy period of time in the USA in the last century in which cash only strategies have been competitive with the stock market.  None.  And if you find a study that says otherwise, then look at how they computed the numbers.  I guarantee that they got that result by ignoring dividends.<p>Now this is not to say that there isn't a role for cash in your investment strategy.  Of course there is.  There is real value in limiting volatility, and there are times when it makes sense to adjust how exposed you are to the market.",1256148843

They have a clearly-delineated split between the language specification ( <a href=""http://docs.python.org/reference/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/reference/index.html</a> ) and the standard library specification ( <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/index.html</a> ) and additional, separate documentation over lower-level aspects of implementation.<p>Each body of documentation is organized for the convenience of its typical user.",1256148682

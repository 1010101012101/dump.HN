Besides tables you can for example add text fields and images to a sheet. This makes it much much more natural to create reports and it encourages to split up your huge tables in logical units.<p>Oh and one other thing: Modifying columns/rows is consistant over all iWorks applications: Alt + arrow-keys let's you insert rows/columns above, below, to the right or left. MS Office's inconsistency and lack of hotkeys for such an essential feature makes me rage every time I use it.<p>Numbers sure has shortcomings though: no pivot tables, very limited scripting support, limited filtering / data manipulation.

3980680,comment,3978440,3980431,7,0,richardw,,,"1) GM is exactly the right type of advertiser for Facebook. They don't want you to buy a car right now, they want to get the brand in front of you. They, with all their resources, can't get it to work.<p>2) Google Adwords-style advertising is the absolute shortest line between a person who has a need and someone willing to fulfil that. To be worth more, Facebook has to either make ""brand awareness"" advertising bigger than ""need fulfilment"", or somehow figure out a way to beat Google at need fulfilment before Google heads them off. The thing about need fulfilment is that the user is already motivated to solve their problem, at this exact point in time that they're searching. You just have to fulfil that. That's worth pure gold for a marketer. Currently on Facebook the ""need"" is to get more cows, or whatever. To be ""worth more"" than Google, you need to use the social graphy thing to figure out how to get someone to spend money. But see #4.<p>3) I haven't spent one cent on Facebook, so either find a way to get me to spend one cent, or increase the value of the ""whales"" somehow.<p>4) Google knows a lot more about me than FB does. I spend every day telling Google what I'm thinking about, via the searches I do. Facebook, I might click a ""like"", or post a status. You can be sure that the things I'll ""like"" are a tiny subset of the things I search about. Google therefore has to hold back in which information they use about me, so they don't look creepy. Zuck would be happy looking creepy, but he's not able to get enough info to even begin to look creepy. [edit: so really, Google could make more by flicking a few ""add creepy"" switches. If FB desensitises us to that first, Google is still more likely to be able to leverage it.]<p>So, what would make Facebook worth more? Maybe if they leveraged the asset of having-everyone-on-board in a way to make the specific applications (e.g. search) irrelevant. They've done a reasonable job already, what with integrating it into websites, but that still isn't making them money in any direct way. Indirect ways are not going to beat the direct way.<p>So, Facebook is still a bit like Google pre-Adwords. We have a great lock, still looking for the key.<p>[edit: please tell me why I'm wrong. Really - I'd love to hear a way Facebook could win, would be an awesome lesson!]",1337147348

I can see ads getting lots of Likes because others friends like Movie or Brand X but beyond those kinds of ads people on Facebook aren't likely to leave the site. In fact the whole site is designed to keep you there do ads are kind of useless. Likes are meaningless. They don't generate dollars.

It seems a bit odd to me that they're experiencing issues this severe for two reasons:<p>1) Diablo was developed from the fairly unusual position of knowing it would face a launch to millions of users before development ever started. I'd have imagined having this ""scale it to infinity"" mentality from the starting line would have helped a lot.<p>2) The whole game is conceptually VERY easy to shard. Unlike WoW, there is very little interaction between players that are not in a party together, and the maximum party size is four.<p>I wonder whether the failures have anything to do with the achivement tracking/broadcasting. It's the only component I can think of that breaks out of these obvious sharding boundaries, and I can kind of imagine how large friend lists might cause problems. Additionally, it seems achievement progress was lost from the time leading up to one of the downtimes.<p>I know it's easy to speculate from here, and there are probably very legitimate reasons for all of this.

3980642,comment,3979899,3979899,95,0,grellas,,,"The quoted exchange is between Judge Alsup and Oracle's counsel, David Boies, and concerns the issue of what damages Oracle intends to seek in phase 3 of this trial (phase 1: copyright liability; phase 2: patent liability; phase 3: damages). The jury hung on the major copyright claims and the judge has yet to rule on the ultimate question whether the 37 Java API packages at issue are even protectible by copyright. Oracle proved infringement concerning the nine lines of code constituting rangeCheck and the judge held as a matter of law that Google had infringed respecting a couple of test files that were subsequently removed from Android. In this context, under applicable law, Oracle may elect to get statutory damages of $150K for each of the infringements or it may elect to go after what are known as ""infringer's profits"" - meaning that it would ask the jury to award it damages measured by profits made by Google on account of the infringing acts. Mr. Boies is telling the judge that Oracle wants to go for infringer's profits ""as a matter of principle"" and the judge is telling him, in effect, that he is astounded that Oracle would be prepared to make a claim for a billion dollars (or some other very large number) based essentially on nine lines of code among the tens of millions of lines of code in Android and a few test files. Mr. Boies strains to offer various rationales for how Oracle might prove damages of this type, mostly tied to the idea that Google gained in time to market for its Android product by relying on the infringing materials. The judge basically tells him that this position is ridiculous and that he cannot believe that an attorney of Mr. Boies's stature would even make it (at one point, he notes that Oracle is trying to make a ""federal case"" out of this and, catching himself, says (I paraphrase here), ""oops, this <i>is</i> a federal case . . . well, seeks to make a <i>bigger</i> federal case out of it than it is""). (The Groklaw report on this exchange is worth reading and even fun in spots - it may be found here: <a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120515120106322#Update_5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120515120106322#U...</a>)<p>This exchange highlights the rather unfavorable position that Oracle finds itself in on the copyright issues. It has won nothing of significance and stands to get very little from the jury on these issues. Concerning the broader claims on which the jury hung, it still faces a potent objection from Google that it cannot assert copyright violations based on the 37 API packages owing to defects in how the Java program was registered with the copyright office. It also faces the risk that the judge or a court of appeals will hold that APIs are not copyrightable.<p>A word on this last item: Much as the developer community believes very strongly that APIs should not be copyrightable, the Ninth Circuit law that is binding on this judge (beginning with <i>Johnson Controls</i> in 1989) is not particularly favorable in that it provides that software programs are to be analyzed item-by-item on the facts of each particular case to determine whether any particular component is protectible expression versus an unprotectible idea, function, system, or method of operation (this is in stark contrast to the First Circuit, which held that judges could make categorical judgments that certain components are functional by nature and hence unprotectible by copyright (as opposed to patent), as the menu structure was held to be many years ago in the Lotus/Borland case. Google is arguing the issue categorically (""APIs are inherently unprotectible under copyright law"") but this makes for a tough sell in a jurisdiction where the appellate authority has said that such issues cannot be categorically determined. Google has alternative arguments, the main one tied to a leading Ninth Circuit case (<i>Sega</i>) that Google argues enables copying of functional elements of any program needed to ensure compatability. But, in my view, astute as this judge is, he will be bound to apply the fact-specific approach, making it tough for him to adopt Google's strongest argument and thus significantly reducing the prospects for a definitive ruling from the judge along the lines sought by Google (of course, this might come on appeal, where the court is free to reshape its earlier precedents in light of modern-day realities in the software world).",1337146478

Last year, HTC was including T-Mobile's band on their high-end devices (Sensation, Flyer, etc.), but this year they've moved towards AT&T bands (unsurprisingly, I suppose - especially since T-Mobile is refarming 1900MHz and dialing back the 1700 MHz network soon).",1337144916

The new Thinkpad keyboard is virtually indistinguishable from the old Thinkpad keyboard in terms of how it feels except for the different layout.  The different location of certain function keys is something you quickly get used to if you decide not to be butthurt about it.  To have your productivity affected by the switch to the new Thinkpad keyboard really does require some sort of mental disorder.<p>(The current Thinkpad keyboard on the T420 and friends isn't an ""authentic"" Thinkpad keyboard experience anyway.)",1337144874

The carriers demand extreme control over the hardware and software pushed through those sales channels, and the manufacturers (other than Apple) have no choice but to give them that control because that is how you win in this business.  Just ask Samsung, who made $5 billion last quarter selling devices running outdated Android 2.x.   Or ask HTC, who got crushed by the carriers after offering devices with unlocked Android bootloaders.<p>If you're a manufacturer, you win by being the one who makes the carriers the most money per customer per month.<p>So how does ICS help Samsung make more money for Verizon?  How does upgrading old devices to ICS help Samsung make more money for Verizon?  If you're Samsung, that's the only question you're trying to answer.<p>The reality is that ICS does not help Samsung or any other manufacturer make more money for Verizon, and that's why ICS adoption has been so low.<p>The problem is that the manufacturers (other than Apple) have little desire to change this business model.  If (and when) Samsung begins to defy the carriers, LG and Motorola and HTC will trip over themselves to take Samsung's place and become the next darling of the carriers.",1337144726

Then again we have only ever seen an interface mockup, haven't we? Maybe the software / device they had didn't work. Still no excuse to just let this idea go, I still think that a booklet style tablet with pen, capacitive touchscreen and these GUI ideas would be great for many usecases. What's MS's thought process here? ""Yeah no, we don't think specialized solutions like these are great for us, let's instead keep smashing on Win32 until it fits unto smartphones and tablets and serve one huge shit sausage.""<p>I wait with pleasure for the business user reactions once Windows' most useful and perfected feature, the start menu, is gone and replaced with a touch optimized fullscreen window with gigantic whitespaces and huge mouse paths for achieving anything.

Even things like monitors, that you would think they could get right, still have issues where it crashes - literally crashes - and you have to unplug it to reboot it.<p>So my general rule of thumb with Asus is: stay the hell away unless you can take the time to return/exchange it 2 or 3 times to get one that works. And never let Asus repair it because they break other things in the process, and they take so long that you can&#x27;t even return it by the time you get it back.",1414940165

She says that school pupils used to be fined for speaking Taiwanese in class. The pupils responded by learning sentences that sounded like legitimate Mandarin sentences, but were actually sound-alikes for sentences that made crude insults in Taiwanese. The last time we lived in Taiwan (1998-2001), the government had relaxed its former stringent prohibitions on public use of Taiwanese, and we would see handwritten signs in Chinese characters in markets with obviously Taiwanese vocabulary and phrasing. Similarly, when I have traveled to Hong Kong, I have seen printed official signs that are quite baffling to someone who has only studied standard modern written Chinese, but are perfectly understandable to readers who know how Cantonese is written in Chinese characters.",1414940157

Updates fail, reverting changes, installing ~150 updates more after 8.1 upgrade. Random SDBUS BSOD, reboots, WiFi / 3G connectivity issues. It seems that everything is working badly and update installation failures and blue screens are quite random and common. Eventually after tens of reboots and installing all kind of stuff you&#x27;ll get everything installed. If you&#x27;re lucky. Then you&#x27;ll install upgrades by the device manufacturer, which take long time and require multiple reboots etc. 
Luckily I&#x27;m able to install these in volume as well as tasks are rarely urgent. So I can put tens of tables on table and run updates, after a few hours I&#x27;ll revisit those, see what the situation is and continue. Yes, it&#x27;s not consistent, some tables and laptops in the batch can be much slower to install and other faster, others fail and some won&#x27;t etc. It&#x27;s just basically absolutely horrible experience. I feel and know very well the feeling you described. Suddenly touch screen is totally unresponsive, or doesn&#x27;t work at all. You&#x27;ll need to use USB-keyboard and so on.

That said, you yourself can try to use a legal threat as a means to turn the tides in your favor. In my personal experience, it has worked. I have made a detailed comment on the relevant laws [0].<p>I wouldn&#x27;t prefer the legal gun option. You can show salary slips from your previous employer to show your proof of employment to your prospective employer(s) should you ever land in a bond-like situation and want to quit. Most prospective employers have no problem accepting that as a proof of employment in the previous firm. The issues arise when your &quot;bonded&quot; employer asks to deposit money in escrow accounts, educational certificates etc. with them. However, these are very good indicator(s) to avoid such firms. Keep in mind, that by law - it is illegal to withhold such certificates, money etc. to the vulnerability of the employee [0]. The MD of the company and the immediate manager can go to prison or have to pay fine or both for this stunt.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8546534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8546534</a>",1414939817

These are false comparisons, and have absolutely nothing to do with Vim.<p>Does your Sublime guy code fast because he&#x27;s an amazing touch-typist, or because he has better command over Sublime&#x27;s shortcuts and special features than your Vim guys do?  If it&#x27;s the former, then it&#x27;s irrelevant.  If it&#x27;s the latter, then it clashes with the point you tried to make in the next paragraph.<p>Of course your IDE guy is better at refactoring code.  (S)he&#x27;s using an IDE.  That&#x27;s what they do, better than any text editor.  Comparing editors to full-blown IDE&#x27;s is fairly &quot;meta&quot; to the topic at hand.  However, it should be noted that almost every major IDE has built-on or plugin support for popular editor keybindings.  I use Vim keybindings with IntelliJ... and even with my fairly baseline Vim familiarity, I&#x27;m able work several times more fluidly than on vanilla IntelliJ.<p><pre><code>  It may be true Vim requires the fewest key strokes to edit text.  In practice,
  you&#x27;ll lose more time finding those ideal keystrokes.  It&#x27;s wasted effort to

</code></pre>
This is just outright nonsense, and tells me that you personally have never learned to use <i>any</i> text editor well.  Sure, I would agree that it&#x27;s unproductive to scour StackOverflow for a magical one-step incantation for EVERY thing you ever do.  However, that is not what being proficient with Vim (or any other text editor) means.  It means you organically pick up on things over time, such that you aren&#x27;t having to think about it when using them.<p>If you pick up Drew Neil&#x27;s book &quot;Practical Vim&quot;, it&#x27;s structured around 121 &quot;tips&quot;.  Each one is short, clear, and something that you can pick up and internalize in an hour.  After the first 24 or so, you will absolutely be more productive that you would be with &quot;Windows Notepad&quot; bindings in the same situation.<p>It&#x27;s not about crazy incantations that refactor your entire codebase in one keypress.  It&#x27;s about simple little things, that add up:<p>* <i>I want to add an extra parameter to this method I just wrote.  So rather than taking my hand off the keyboard and clicking there with my mouse (or hitting the arrow keys over and over), I just press &quot;f)&quot; to jump to the closing parentheses and start adding text.</i><p>* <i>I want to replace everything on the current line, starting from my cursor position somewhere in the middle of that line.  Rather than moving my hand to the mouse and dragging a selection, or holding <Shift> while hitting the arrow keys over and over, I instead just press &quot;c$&quot; and start adding text.</i><p>Sure, commands can be a bit arcane, but I learned them organically over a period of time... and these are real-world things that I do many times almost every single day as a coder.  I probably only use 10% of Vim&#x27;s available functionality, and that&#x27;s enough to make my coding a much more fluid experience than it was before.  Until you&#x27;ve experienced it first-hand, it&#x27;s hard to grasp just HOW DISRUPTIVE it is to your flow and thought process to move your hand from the keyboard to mouse and back!<p>I don&#x27;t care which editor (or IDE keybindings) you use.  Vim, Emacs, Sublime, whatever.  But you will absolutely be a more productive programmer if you pick one and dig into it over time.  You ARE limited by your typing flow, and just don&#x27;t realize it.  If anyone really believes that isn&#x27;t the case, then why bother to learn touch-typing?  Take your two index fingers and try coding with the &quot;hunt-and-peck&quot; method, and see how it doesn&#x27;t limit your thought process.",1414938644

I checked the example dialogues against dialogues posted online by native speakers of each of the languages, both for accuracy in transcribing the Chinese characters and for natural idiomatic expression in each language.<p>How you might write the conversation<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>他會說普通話嗎？<p>他不會。<p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters contrasts with how you would write<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>佢識唔識講廣東話？<p>佢唔識。<p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don&#x27;t know Chinese characters, many more words than &quot;Mandarin&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; differ between those sentences in Chinese characters.<p>Chinese characters still represent SPEECH (not ideas or abstract concepts) and do so in a way that is specific to the particular Chinese (Sinitic) language that one speaks. The long story about this can be found in the books The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy[1] or Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems[2] by the late John DeFrancis or the book Ideogram: Chinese Characters and the Myth of Disembodied Meaning[3] by J. Marshall Unger. The book Reading in the Brain: The Science and Evolution of a Human Invention[4] by Stanislas Dehaene is a very good book about reading in general, and has a good cross-cultural perspective.<p>Many other examples of words, phrases, and whole sentences that are essentially unreadable to persons who have learned only Modern Standard Chinese can be found in texts produced in Chinese characters by speakers of other Sinitic languages (&quot;Chinese dialects&quot;). Similar considerations apply to Japanese, which is not even a language cognate with Chinese, and also links Chinese characters to particular speech morphemes (whether etymologically Japanese or Sino-Japanese) rather than with abstract concepts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFrancis/dp/0824810686/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Language-Fantasy-John-DeFranci...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comparisons/dp/0824812077/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comp...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodied-Meaning/dp/0824827600/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ideogram-Chinese-Characters-Disembodie...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readinginthebrain.pagesperso-orange.fr/intro.htm</a>",1414938417

In the US, software development has always, until perhaps very recently, been considered a very low status career and with low long-term potential. That is, versus one of the classic engineering or medical jobs. By the way, in the US, IT generally means support desk job, which is seen as the lowest of the low. Only very recently has the median software development job approached anywhere near a medical specialist or the classic engineering job, and it&#x27;s still far below the wage of many US doctors.<p>I&#x27;d say that the US general public is still expecting the imminent outsourcing of all software development, to foreigners making $2/hour somewhere far away, to occur soon. People in the field don&#x27;t expect this, but that&#x27;s how outsiders perceive it.<p>This low-status is a huge contributor to what keeps most US women from pursuing software development as a career, according to women I&#x27;ve talked to. It really is that simple and obvious.<p>This is also why there&#x27;s a trend of US software developers prominently adding &quot;scientist&quot; or &quot;engineer&quot; to their job titles.

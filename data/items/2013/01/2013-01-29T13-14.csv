Some Javascript _implementations_ are definitely faster than some Python _implementations_, but nothing about either language makes one inherently faster than the other.<p>And in the Brython case, the Python is being translated to Javascript, so it is getting the same benefits out of a fast, JIT-compiled implementation that Javascript normally gets.",1359467996

The people buying it don't consume it, so the quality is low.<p>I think that sums up the enterprise space well.  It's all bought by people who are not using it and want to be as hands off as possible.  That is the core problem - you have to look good on paper (read: big feature list) to get attention. It's a space for heavily-bankrolled startups or people who are creatively repurposing existing software.  Mostly the latter.",1359467985

When working with higher level languages, I completely understand how my numbers will be rounded, precision truncated, etc.<p>Casting back and forth to integers is often problematic, but even more telling is that the programs that have to be very precise generally use fixed-point integers.

5133930,comment,5133365,5133752,2,0,jeswin,,,"You should perhaps focus on adding value to the discussion, than going on about people you hardly know anything about.<p>JS and Python offer comparable expressiveness for most programming tasks: basic imperative language features, first class functions, closures etc. If you miss list comprehensions, a better syntax for lambdas or classes, go ahead and use the favorite JS shorthand - coffeescript. It _really_ is JS. Even if you don't use coffee, having first class functions would let you write some of those missing features in a library (albeit with a slightly clunkier syntax).<p>Sure there are nuances, like scoping rules. On the plus side, having a single programming language on the server and client saves some time. Also, most of the libraries being async in nature helps in typical I/O heavy apps.<p>I draw these inferences from a medium sized JS project I have going on at <a href=""http://www.poe3.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.poe3.com</a> (source: <a href=""https://github.com/jeswin/poetry-source"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jeswin/poetry-source</a>).

It's not the explicit rules that are the issue. It's the stuck-up subtle shit people never tell you about. If you are passed over for a promotion or a good project because you wear headphones too much or don't appear productive, no one will tell you this because (a) it's subconscious and, (b) even if it were conscious, they wouldn't.

Typically there were a couple things that helped including team (a small area dedicated to a team that worked closely together to solve problems), and an environment or workload that did not include multitasking (call centers are good for this most of the time despite the auditory distractions).<p>The problem though is that in chaotic environments, open plan offices are disasters waiting to happen, or maybe they are disasters constantly happening.  You have no insulation from anything else and so no ability to be productive and take real control.<p>On the whole the fact is that distractions come in different forms and all forms of distractions have pros and cons.  A fully isolated environment is productivity-killing.  We need some socialization to be productive.  On the other hand, open plan offices very often are too social.<p>On the whole I prefer working from home.  Sure there are distractions, but on the whole, my productivity is best there.

As far as I know, they haven't.</i><p>The problem is that an open-plan ban is not appropriate for all work environments. One example would be a hospital. If you can't handle the stress of an operating room (and many people can't) then you shouldn't be a surgeon. The job has intrinsic stress, and that's a factor in the compensation.<p>That's the fundamental problem with regulation and government intervention: it's hard to get the special cases right. An open-plan ban would be a good thing for the vast majority of white-collar office workers, but it clearly can't be applied to all work environments (medicine, military).<p>If I recall correctly, many countries do have lower limits on personal working space, usually in the neighborhood of 10 m^2. It'd be hard to enact a blanket open-plan ban because the concept isn't well-defined, but work space regulations are already in place.<p>An additional factor that is hard to regulate: the health load of an open-plan office seems to be a function of the person's age, position in the hierarchy, and the amount of personal space. Open-plan wouldn't be so bad if people had the recommended 200 SF (18.6 m^2) with barriers at their backs. At the typical 50 SF, with the person visible from behind and prone to managerial harassment, it's a catastrophe.<p><i>However, what you said about >90% health problems and 10-15 year worker lifetimes oversells and undermines what are otherwise very good points.</i><p>Perhaps 90% is high, but the going assumption people make when designing office spaces is that the typical open plan office (< 100 SF, open-back visibility) will increase attrition by about 10% per year for younger people and 20% for older people. How much of this one wishes to attribute to health issues, and how much to less serious garden-variety unhappiness, is somewhat of an open question.",1359466601

To a large degree, that's what open-plan offices are really about. It's not explicitly presented that way, but the purpose of the brogrammer culture <i>is</i> to exclude people-- especially women and older men.<p>By the time people are in their 40s and 50s, work-related health problems aren't things people joke about during an annoying project. They're things that actually happen. Your typical competent 45-year-old sees an open-plan office and says, ""No thanks"", knowing from experience that such environments are not only unproductive but dangerous (cardiac issues, anxiety disorders, digestive problems).<p>Also, it's not only the noise that makes open-plan offices hell. It's the social overload of being visible to other people. (Open-back visibility, which causes vertigo and neurological problems, is especially bad.) People are bad at multitasking-- men are especially bad at it, but suffer from a Dunning-Kruger effect-- and having to dedicate a constant slice of brain-space to the appearance of productivity, in addition to actual productivity, means that a person is forced into a state of ineffective, frustrating, and just plain <i>stupid</i> multitasking for over 8 hours.",1359464876
5133731,comment,5133047,5133610,4,0,eric_bullington,,,"I can't speak to ClojureScript, but in my experience, CoffeeScript is primarily used by people who <i>already</i> know JavaScript.  You can't use CoffeeScript effectively without understanding JavaScript.  Most of us who use CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript appreciate CoffeeScript's syntactic shortcuts, which for us makes it quicker to write and improvise with new ideas, as well as its enforced whitespace, which makes it easier to write maintainable code.<p>Otherwise, as someone whose first and second strongest languages are Python and Javascript, I agree with you.  JavaScript is a beautiful language that accommodates a variety of programming styles.  As you mention, JavaScript is also much more performant than Python, which makes me questions whether Python would ever be a viable replacement for JavaScript in the browser.  Add to that JavaScript's excellent webworker API compared to Python's choices for parallel programming.<p>Now, Lua, on the other hand, would be an excellent browser language (specifically the LuaJit implementation).  Lua is close enough to JavaScript that folks could easily pick it up, and its blazing fast.  But it will never happen.<p>Besides, there are so many great JS libraries now that in most cases, I wouldn't want to switch to Lua in the browser and face re-inventing the wheel (same reason why I generally use Python instead of Lua elsewhere).

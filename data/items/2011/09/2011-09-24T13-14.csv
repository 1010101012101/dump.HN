Living costs are very high, but the fact that you could go shopping for groceries across the street at 3am makes up for it.",1316872793

NYC is more cut-throat than SF - you know the old song ""If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.""  This is a problem with so many people working so hard that it is almost an uncaring attitude for your fellow man.
However, NYC is where the money is and a good surrogate to Silicon Valley.  New York is a very active city, and has the best mix of culture, food, and experience that you will find anywhere in the world.  There is good infrastructure to live outside the city (but you will pay in time for commuting).   If you do decide on NYC, I will gladly help - look me up on my profile",1316872007

I believe he is saying FB has become so ubiquitous and pervasive in our lives, that in the social media it dominates as a fundamental utility. It has become so important to 100's of millions of people and that there is little recourse if you did not want to use them. and yes there is Google plus, but there is not enough people on that service currently to rival the social interactions of Facebook. And regardless of how well a service is designed it is pointless if you can't have the same level of interaction with other people.
I think a better comparison would be the monopoly AT&T had over long distance telephone service in the mid-20th century. It was not as essential to living as water or power was but still seen as a monopoly and was broken up into the Baby Bells. I think Facebook falls in that category while you can definitely live your life without it, it has become the de facto place for social interaction.

There were many competitors but none of them had the overlap of skills I had, and so I had a huge advantage.<p>Last year the project made ~$25k profit, and this year I hope to reach $50k, with an investment of about five hours per week.

Sure, you end up with unfinished projects but you're hopefully learning tons and having a blast.<p>But if you're thinking about structuring things so you can better go from ideas to businesses, you need to reevaluate your entire approach. You need tools that can practically guide you through the stages of creating a software business, not just a general philosophy of getting things done.<p>Currently in the startup world, there's an interesting convergence between customer development and lean as applied to tech startups. Customer development is described in Steven Blank's ""The Four Steps to the Epiphany"" and Eric Ries' ""The lean startup"" is the book on lean startups. Both Blank and Ries have contributed to this convergence that I talk about at their respective sites [1] [2] but there's also overviews available [3] [4]. But why am I even recommending these two approaches? Because they cover business development from start to finish from as applied to software startups, so you know the advice is specific to our industry and very practical in nature. If you're serious about the business of software, customer development and lean startup will help you create a business with better certainty of execution and outcome. Together they provide a very potent combination of roadmap and compass, and principles and philosophy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://steveblank.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.recessmobile.com/blog/my-take-on-customer-development-and-the-lean-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recessmobile.com/blog/my-take-on-customer-develop...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://danielmckenzie.com/blog/2010/07/design-thinking-customer-development-and-lean-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danielmckenzie.com/blog/2010/07/design-thinking-custo...</a>",1316869509

(Soldiering is a lot more fun before you're under fire than afterwards.)<p>B) It's not so hard to be a happy amateur, but the amateur experience is much different from the pro experience. Pros need to make money, consistently, and that is a big constraint, often to the point that it takes an entirely different skill set. (e.g. Being a freelance programmer or musician is as much about marketing and customer service as it is about code or music, and the stuff that's valuable to customers may be boring to the point of tears for you. Ask a classical musician to tell you how they feel about the inexplicably popular Pachelbel's <i>Canon</i>.)<p>C) And, of course, jobs with barriers to entry are hard to really understand until the barriers are down. Research has a whole series of barriers: Being a science major is not like being a grad student, being a grad student is not like being a postdoc, being a postdoc is not like being a junior prof.<p>Mind you, though you can never know what it is <i>really</i> like to do a job without doing it, you can interview people and get some big hints. And you'll find that medicine is actually pretty easy to research, as careers go. The OP's points are not hidden mysteries. They have been made before. There are a lot of doctors, both successful ones and burned-out ones, and they're happy to talk. The trick is to be able to <i>listen to what they tell you</i>, and unfortunately there are also a lot of teachers and parents who are happy to push you into medicine regardless of what the actual doctors are telling you.",1316869291

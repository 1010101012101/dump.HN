A company doesn&#x27;t need to run their front end like a hackathon in order to be great, in fact, much of their demographic might have had a learning curve just to learn how to watch movies on their ipad, so doing drastic UI redesigns might actually create a churn from subscriptions.  Netflix works on basically every platform(even ubuntu now) with basically no issues except for the native install, and gets right to the video after only a few clicks/touches.  Remember when they were carousel and now they&#x27;re a direct slider?  Seems they would simplify due to data.  Also the argument for no front end work I find to be unfounded as some of THE BEST Javascript, reactive programming seems to be coming out of the netflix shop with amazing event listening management presentations and and other impeccable reactive front end coming out of netflix.  I use those videos to study and learn tons on reactive javascript and find their front end to be exactly what it is.  On a meta level and simplicity level superbly build and prestine.",1416178574

We haven&#x27;t really considered what our true criteria are, what layer they live at etc.  There are still many innovations ahead.  And don&#x27;t think the carriers aren&#x27;t well versed in how to game the system!<p>You say, correctly, that Title II is common carriage.  But consider what came along with that.  Note that I think CC has mostly worked with busses (you can&#x27;t discriminate by race, at least) and the roads.  It&#x27;s worked well with trains.  In other areas it hasn&#x27;t got such a good record (and my politics are what is called in America &quot;liberal&quot;).<p>In the case of telephony, title II unarguably held back technological development.  All the development was done at the center.  AT&T and Bell Labs did a really astounding job of development in the core (FDM in the 1930&#x27;s for chrissake, and direct dialing with routing tables on punched metal cards in the 1940s).  Not to mention SS7, the transistor and fibre optics.  But all that came at a huge cost: phone calls were expensive, long distance was a limited service, and all innovation at the edge was explicitly, and by legal force, suppressed.  You probably don&#x27;t remember how horrible it was to use a Bell 103 modem, or the crappy approved phones.  Mobile telephony was expensive and essentially useless.  The communication infrastructure of today would be unrecognizable to a telephone engineer of 1990, while the communication infrastructure of 1990 would have been be easily comprehensible to a telephone engineer of 1925.<p>My point is: that it worked at all was because we had a useful metric: 99% of all calls had to be completed, even if it meant overbuilding to guarantee that on Mother&#x27;s day.  On the other hand we don&#x27;t even have an equivalent of an Erlang [1] in the internet domain.  I don&#x27;t believe NN can legitimately be legislated in 2014, and any attempt will screw us at LEAST as much as ATT/comcast/verizon etc al are screwing us today.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(unit)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(unit)</a>",1416178489

I&#x27;m not a fanboy, I&#x27;ve run into more than my fair share of issues with MS SQL, but none of your problems are a result of any SQL Server version I&#x27;ve heard of. Your response screams FUD, to me.<p>Now, you say that you possibly had too many cooks in the kitchen. So perhaps your complaints are due to the other cooks, or maybe some of your complaints came to you second-hand. But here is my analysis of your complaints, having run SQL Server for a number of years:<p>A) Just doesn&#x27;t happen. Index-related statements are transactional and ACID-compliant. (i.e.: you can, in a transaction, add, drop, and update triggers, indexes, entire tables, etc. along with data.) This has been the case since at least I&#x27;ve started using SQL Server with the 2005 release.<p>B) I don&#x27;t know why this is the case with php5-mssql, but I would blame the authors of the package. varchar, nvarchar, text, etc fields all support > 255 characters.<p>C) I don&#x27;t know of any version of SQL Server or Windows Server that does this. No Windows Server version &quot;locks IO&quot; on a license check failure (this would obviously cause huge problems with filesystem consistency). As far as I know, no SQL Server version does live license checking or phones home. I have no idea what your symptom was, but I suspect someone else broke something. A running SQL Server installation does not &quot;stop&quot;, nor does it need the license to be renewed at any point. Cumulative and service pack updates don&#x27;t do license checks either, as far as I know. In fact, an expired license doesn&#x27;t affect anything, and probably even reflects a misunderstanding of how licensing works. If you purchased a license, even if you paid yearly for 2-3 years, your SQL Server license is good forever. Forever! New versions require software assurance, but you have to choose to install those manually, it&#x27;s opt-in, not opt-out. Automatic updates should never break SQL Server.<p>D) Is it at all possible this was the migrate to PostgreSQL tool&#x27;s fault? Because I&#x27;ve run weekly backups and restores of SQL Server databases for the past several versions for many years, and had no problem with a .bak file being corrupt.",1416177849

(My guess: because as a dude you&#x27;re used to people acting as if your opinions are important. Privilege stunts growth.)<p>And you have done it in a way that discourages exactly the sort of detail that you claim to want. Go read some stories from women reporting rape. A lot of them get treated with the same &quot;skepticism&quot;. A skepticism that is never applied to, say, theft reports. [1] And you know what they learn? To never, ever, ever report a rape. Because they correctly read the tactical, situation skepticism for what it is. Go spend a few hours reading the #beenrapedneverreported stories if you want to get that.<p>> My mindset is that of a scientist I guess.<p>This kills me.

8615718,comment,8614084,8614084,0,0,timtadh,,,"The real solution to this problem is to properly remove the left recursion. Student&#x27;s often make the mistake the author did. Let&#x27;s examine our favorite grammar:<p><pre><code>    E -> E + T\n       | E - T\n       | T\n    T -> T * F\n       | T / F\n       | F\n    F -> id\n       | number\n       | ( E )\n</code></pre>\nThe obvious way to remove left recursion in the grammar is to &quot;flip&quot; the non-terminals. Like so:<p><pre><code>    E -> T + E\n       | T - E\n       | T\n    T -> F * T\n       | F / T\n       | F\n    F -> id\n       | number\n       | ( E )\n</code></pre>\nThis is wrong. Consider the string &quot;28 / 7 * 2&quot;. The orginal grammar produces the following parse:<p><pre><code>          E\n          |\n          T\n         /|\\n        T * F\n       /|\  |\n      T / F 2\n      |   |\n      F   7\n      |\n     28\n</code></pre>\nThe new grammar produces:<p><pre><code>          E\n          |\n          T\n         /|\\n        F / T\n        |  /|\\n       28 F * T\n          |   |\n          7   F\n              |\n              2\n</code></pre>\nWhen computing the expression. These tree produce different answers. The first gives &quot;8&quot;, the correct answer, the second gives &quot;2&quot;. Basically, it is parenthesized incorrectly.<p>To fix this problem the solution is to insert intermediate non-terminals into the grammar:<p><pre><code>    E -> T E&#x27;\n    E&#x27; -> + T E&#x27;\n        | - T E&#x27;\n        | e            <--- standing in for epsilon, the empty string\n    T -> F T&#x27;\n    T&#x27; -> * F T&#x27;\n        | / F T&#x27;\n        | e\n    F -> id\n       | number\n       | ( E )\n</code></pre>\nConsider the new parse tree<p><pre><code>             E\n            / \\n           /   \\n          T     E&#x27;\n         / \    |\n        F   T&#x27;  e\n        |  /|\\n       28 / | \\n         /  |  \\n        /   F   T&#x27;\n            |  /|\\n            7 * F T&#x27;\n                | |\n                2 e\n</code></pre>\nIf processed correctly this tree will yield the correct expression tree.<p><pre><code>          *\n         / \\n        /   2\n       / \\n     28   7\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;trick&quot; is to swing up subtrees from the prime nodes. The operator coming up from the prime node is going to be the root of the subtree (for that precedence level) and the new operator is going to be inserted as the left most descendent.<p>To see how this works with code.

For example, emacs uses &quot;frame&quot; to mean what we now call a &quot;window&quot; and vice versa, and all the functions for interacting with windows and frames reflect this usage. If one just did a blanket search-and-replace swap of window and frame throughout the entire Emacs codebase and documentation, you would probably have a working Emacs, but all external packages and customization code that interact with windows or frames in any way would now be broken. You can&#x27;t just update the documentation but leave the code as is, because then you have to start telling people ridiculous things like &quot;switch windows with &#x27;other-frame&#x27; and switch frames with &#x27;other-window&#x27;&quot;, which isn&#x27;t going to be any less confusing that what you started with. Elisp is a dynamic language, so you can&#x27;t set up some sort of name-translation layer and use it for backward-compatibility with old code (that code could have a reference to an old name inside a quoted form, or even a string).<p>And the window/frame term swap is only one of many such examples. So basically, you could make your own Emacs that uses modern terminology and is completely incompatible with all existing 3rd-party elisp code, and then you could try to convince people to switch to it. But would having two equivalent but fundamentally incompatible Emacs/elisp variants be beneficial to Emacs as a whole? I doubt it.",1416175844

All the examples are of something much more specific: APIs go away when a company embraces an advertising-driven revenue model.<p>Google offered a SOAP API because back then they weren&#x27;t an ad company. When they became an ad company the API went away, because you could use it to get Google search results without the ads.

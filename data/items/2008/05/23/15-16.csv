There are (at least) two distinctly different skill sets or personality types essential for a successful entrepreneurial business - one is the thinking-of-new-ideas-and-making-them-work track and the other is the bookkeeping-and-keeping-up-with-routine track.  I'm not very good at the second; switching back and forth between coding and bookkeeping makes me want to sit in a corner of a dark room and rock back and forth slowly while reciting Kipling.  Some people, though, are really good at the second.  I know a few people who manage both and I'm rather in awe of them.<p>Perhaps there's a third type, too - the guy who goes out and sells the idea, like Jobs to Woz.<p>How do you solve this problem?  What am I doing wrong?",1211558371

But by then, there will be other tasks that are not well defined that require your attention.  And the cycle continues until the company is no longer a startup and the entrepreneur has lost his/her place in the company (or he/she matures into a manager).<p>At the end of the day, an entrepreneur's job is to connect the dots.

Like other fads in software, unit testing was oversold.<p>Meanwhile, the logic of the article seems weak:<p>1. A company that claimed to auto-generate unit tests for your code failed? Give me a break. You can't write good tests without understanding what you're testing. If it could do that, why didn't it just auto-generate all your code in the first place? One needn't look far to see why this failed.<p>2. Few OSS tools have been adopted (except xUnit which is used massively)? This is normal. Most open source projects fail, a few succeed big. xUnit won. You don't need much else.<p>3. Not everyone teaches it? Why should everyone do anything?<p>4. Not many new unit testing books? There are many such books already. What don't they cover? Why should there be a whole book about JUnit 4?<p>5. Alternative unit-testing frameworks aren't used... see #2.<p>The author seems to think of unit testing as if it were a domain.

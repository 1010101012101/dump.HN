How do you get readers rushing to turn pages when there's no dramatic tension or involvement with what the reviewer declares ""blank"" characters?<p>The reviewer neglects the structure of the academy breeding competition, instead assuming that everybody hated Ender just because he was better than them.  The school is a crucible and it's not just Ender that's under pressure.

Not feel good about themselves, cry.  This is a really difficult thing to do, and you can read Card's nonfiction books on fiction writing to find out some of the techniques involved.  There are very few authors who can take a consistent shot at making the reader cry actual tears, and (the early) Orson Scott Card is one of them.<p>This reads like someone who made an incorrect guess at what the novel was about, and was offended by that guess.",1227651312

Even without knowing as much as I do now about his particularly distateful (to me, at least) political and social views, it was pretty apparent that Card and I disagree on many critical ethical issues: eugenics, whether the ""ends justify the means,"" and when (if ever) armed conflict is a noble activity.<p>However, the Ender's Game series (like Dune, Wizard of Earthsea, and other young adult Sci-Fi and fantasy I read as a child) still served a valuable role for me in that earlier, more difficult time in my social development. By providing role models that were not, in fact, the typical action hero, athlete, or rich businessman, they showed me a glimpse of a world (however unrealistic and disfunctional) in which a geek <i>could</i> get ahead.<p>For that (and for teaching the ever-valuable lesson of questioning the motives of even respected authority figures) I still owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Card and his menagerie of characters.",1227650565

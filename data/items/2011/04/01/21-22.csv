If the argument is that it imposes a psychological tax on you then I could come up with quite a few examples that are far more taxing and far less rewarding financially. Try being in a war and killing people and compare that with firing 200 people.<p>In most cases you go through an adjustment period, and after a while you get desensitized - or you go crazy. The same happens with CEOs, you're not going to care the same about the 200th-time you fire somebody as you did with the first.<p>I'm not saying is easy, or that anybody can do it, but we need to step back a little. The same way praising a child about their smarts puts them in a well-I-can't-get-any-better locked position, glorifying CEOs prevents us from critically evaluating their performance or even suggesting there's a better way...

That flexibility is pretty awesome.<p>For what it's worth, I suspect what you describe (720p60 @ 6Mbps) is more than fine for most people.

It is also an entirely differnent subject if whe should aim to maximize the amount of humans living on earth (not saying we shouldn't, but I don't think we can simply assume the answer is yes, there are pros and cons).<p>I haven't researched this, but aren't the majority of the current 6 Billion people in regions of the earth with bad infrastructure? If so, it seems likely that they are able to survive without nuclear power, just saying. In any case I am not yet convinced by your argument. I also don't think most power is directly used for saving people's lives. It is used to power factories for building SUVs and stuff like that.<p>In any case, population control is probably inevitable - no matter what cures or food sources or energy sources we'll find, humans will always outgrow them.",1301695067

Just like the radioactive isotopes detected in California.<p>(As opposed to humans in space, who would be in more serious danger of solar radiation.)<p>The reason people are trying to point that out is to help people become familiar with radiation.  Familiar and intentional risks are less scary.  If you want more info on that, I suggest reading Bruce Schneier's books.<p>That said, there are some people who have good reason to worry.  For example, I'm very concerned about how long that plant worker was near the 1 Sv/hr water.  I'm glad they're getting robots over there.<p>Thankfully, it doesn't seem to be more widespread than that.  They're aware of the risks of contaminated food and are on guard.  We've learned quite a bit since Chernobyl.  The engineers will learn a lot here, too.<p>When you study engineering, the first thing they do is tell you horror stories about every major engineering disaster they can find.  The Tacoma Narrows bridge video alone has probably been seen by almost every engineering student since 1941 or so.<p>My point is that, even if they're fighting to keep adequate containment on this plant following a worst-case scenario, the engineers won't let the same things happen again, provided they're allowed to upgrade the existing plants.<p>EDIT:  Accidental italics.",1301695057

And I have a speculative theory - sorry that this is a theory based on gender and its kind of vague.. but facebook makes so much more sense to me when I look at it this way, and I find it an interesting discussion.<p>Basically, you have mother types and you have single women types.  Single women are the early adopter social photo sharers - this is fun for them, and it strengthens reputation and attracts men.  Meanwhile, mothers are off doing what they do - strengthening their family and social relationships through chat, gossip, hobbies, etc - it forms a safety net for their family.<p>Then there are men.  Single men chase the single women. This forms a crowd.  This crowd attracts married men / fathers and mothers alike (including people like me who are standing around saying 'wtf?').  Further, the crowd attracts social capitalists who leverage the crowd's attention to promote themselves, their business or their cause.<p>But, the <i>average</i> single female may have 2-7 years of her status as a single woman.  Whereas the average mother will have her role for 18yrs+.  So, you end up with this crowd mass, in the center is hookup activity.  However, the majority of the crowd becomes family-centric and cause-centric security nets.  And yea, when you look at this from a distance, its big and boring.",1301694936

As someone asked above, does productivity increase as you move up an organization's hierarchy? The CEO of Nike has likely never sewn a shoe together, yet he pays the welders on the assembly line; is he more productive?

I'm not entirely sure what having the entire power of all of the flexible compositing techniques are going to help at the exact moment you're trying to present something.

This is how many frames must be held in memory at one time. The gop itself is not limited.\nFurthermore the compression rate for high frame rate actually increases for live action as there has been less change between the frames and even taking a fixed framerate.\nThere are compromises to be made and faster framerate with a fixed bitrate may not be great for all usages but I think that you are being very, and unduly, pessimistic here.\nFrom my experiences at 720p 60fps and a 6 Mbps stream (which we currently have deployed) and a nice encoder you are looking at a very nice picture.",1301693092

Maybe the level of concurrency which behaves differently because performance can drop suddenly when you max out, but really that's just another type of speed. Even in an async environment like node.js you may handle a lot of connections but if there's no speed they hang around for too long waiting for something to return so we're back to speed === scalability in all environments.",1301693069

The same argument was used there, and indeed was spouted off by the kid himself - it wasn't the hackers fault the site got hacked.<p>This line of reasoning seems dangerous to me, as it obscures a criminal or unethical activity by the ultimate result of that activity.  Wrong action is wrong action, regardless of who didn't cover their bases.<p>Should the producer take more precautions, and will they ultimately be burned?

2398056,comment,2397246,2397902,3,0,bpeebles,,,"I would rather count on the media player (Blu-ray player or whatever) or TV to do it than in the source. Think of it this way: in NTSC, DVDs were either had hard 3:2 pull down for 24Hz to the 29.97Hz to show on the interlaced CRTs of the time. But now that we have TVs that can show 24Hz, if you play those DVDs they still have the interpolated frame artifacts. While if you left it up to software pulldown in the DVD player (which they basically all had, since I believe it was part of the standard), they can now be shown at the proper frame rate without interpolation.<p>Most theatrical DVDs released after the early 2000s were 24Hz, as far as I know and depended on the DVD player to convert to NTSC. So now in modern players, they're outputted at 24Hz for 120Hz and 240Hz TVs.<p>The only downside is if you get crappy TVs and/or Bluray players that do horrible pulldown, I guess. But I've gotten hardpulled down DVDs that look horrible as well (I'm looking at you, BBC).",1301691667

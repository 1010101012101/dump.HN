2446251,comment,2446074,2446216,3,0,Confusion,,,"Then the author doesn't actually understand how specs are written and where he should aim his criticism.<p>Pretty much everything that can go wrong with code can go wrong with specs, not because the individual drawing it up is an idiot, but because humans are fallible and the process and communication to reduce the effects of that are lacking.<p>Specs contain bugs, like even code from the best programmers contains bugs. Specs contain duplicate content, because several people worked on it at once and did not have full insight into the part the other was working on. Specs are unclear, like comments from your colleagues on a different project are unclear, because the person drawing up the spec/comment has already soaked up too much domain knowledge to realize his spec/comment is insufficiently explicit. Specs contain missing sections, again because multiple persons were working on it and the division of responsibilities was unclear. Etc., etc.<p>The advantage of code is that it has to compile and execute. You can write tests against it, run code checkers, etc. and find problems early. However, this is not the case for specifications. In that case, the programmer is often the tester and when the inevitable problem is found, the person that wrote the spec should be available for additional explanation, followed by adjusting the spec. This becomes a problem if the person is unavailable or the spec has been approved and re-approving a change is hard or even impossible. In those cases, <i>that</i> is the problem, not the fact that the spec contains a bug. Specs will be unclear. Even after thorough review by programmers, those same programmers will discover problems while implementing the spec, even when they were previously paid to review it to the best of their abilities. The only solution are easy ways of communication to allow for clarification and a process that allows for changes to the spec.<p>Actually, there is an intermediate solution: use the spec directly to create a model of the spec which can be used to automatically create testsuites for the implementation. While creating the model, you will already find many problems and the automatic testsuite can cover many cases that no manually written testcase would cover. In some cases you can even use model checking techniques to prove the spec allows for undefined behavior, such as a deadlock.",1302775072

Using DMC you can command DMR to play a media from a DMS.<p>The fact that you've used loosy implementation doesn't mean that the spec itself is a crap.<p>DLNA is not a silver bullet and has some flaws, but it is thousand times better then AirPlay just because it is more open and does not require specific hardware to accomplish simple tasks.

But what it also boils down to is that  such a company isn't in any danger of having any kind of commercial competition from forks (i.e. the perfect natural monopoly over something that should be public commons), which is something Free Software was supposed to solve in the first place.<p>AGPL is not open anymore and I don't know how it could  pass the open-source definition -- because AGPL is an EULA that restrict what users can do with said software, usage rights that don't have anything to do with redistribution by  the normal copyright definition.<p>AGPL is only Free depending on which side of the dick you're standing.",1302774630

You're taking more risk; why not have more upside?</i><p>No one is suggesting that anyone gets a nice, ample, plush salary. This is a survival salary (anything more should not be allowed until the company can pay all founders). If the startup goes bust, a poor founder working 1 year on survival salary is no more ""in pocket"" than a wealthier founder working 1 year without salary. The valuable thing that they've both lost is a precious year of their life.<p>And if the startup has enough money to pay everyone, it makes no sense that someone would get more shares simply for taking less salary out. That's not what shares are for in an early startup.",1302772547

Let's say you have a join between two tables and the query planner wants to do a hash join, because given the statistics on all the tables, that makes perfect sense. Now let's say that you know that you only actually want the first 10 rows. Well a hash join is cheap per row, but expensive to set up. Nested loops are expensive per row, but cheap to set up. So, maybe, actually,as a DBA and a developer I <i>do</i> know what I want, and I can communicate my intent to the planner, and then let it decide.<p>Anyway, I'd be curious to know what flags the Postgres guys pass into GCC when compiling it. Or do they know better than it's ""planner""?",1302772459

It is famous for bringing cryptography to the attention of thousands of people. It is infamous for the systems that these people then designed and implemented on their own.</i><p>The problems with AC include:<p>* No attention given to any of the practical vulnerabilities in cryptosystems, so that you could deploy code directly from the book and still have it be vulnerable to ECB cut-and-paste or parameter tampering.<p>* A candy shop of random ciphers without any context as to why one would be chosen over the other, with varying degrees of detail provided for each.<p>* Descriptions of protocols that are largely obsolete or discredited, without warnings or disclaimers or, really, any actual didactic purpose.<p>""Applied"" seemed great to me too, but then I became a practioner (though by no means an expert). Even ""Practical"" lacks detail on a lot of major crypto issues --- side-channel attacks, parameter tampering, the safe use of public key primitives and signature validation --- that actually occur in real systems.",1227668238
377186,comment,376883,376883,0,0,zmimon,,,"If I was running Sun I'd seriously look at splitting the company in two.  The software side is shackled by the fact that they need to move in a direction that is going to erode revenue from the hardware side.  As long as they are in the same company you will have a tug of war between two sides pulling two different ways and nobody going anywhere.<p>I agree with the software folks trying to become the best deployment platform for web software.  There's a window of opportunity while the JVM is ahead of other VMs where Sun could pull this off if they can produce a super stable, scalable, easy to deploy runtime that runs everything from PHP to Python, Ruby and Groovy and make it a snap to deploy and manage.   The catch is that I don't think there's any chance they will achieve this if they try and tie it to either Solaris or Sun hardware.   That ship has sailed - hosting these days is either linux or windows for all but the highest top tier.  They need to completely get over it and aggressively push themselves on linux.",1227668197

From deliberately catching a glance of a beautiful woman across the street to tirelessly working at finding a way to end world hunger, it's done at some level for your own satisfaction.

377177,comment,376820,377161,0,0,unalone,,,"No. Absolutely not. There is no objective study of humor, or of interesting. You can't manufacture it. Different people find different things funny for different reasons. I've taken classes in stand-up comedy, improv comedy, and in general dramatics, and this is the big thing that we learn. While humor can be analyzed, and while there's a craft inherent in modeling a joke, that doesn't make humor objective. And it's the same thing with interest. Some people find things interesting that aren't interesting whatsoever to me. The same is true in reverse.<p>I mean, thanks for agreeing with me, but from what you're saying here I think that you're saying something pretty nonsensical. ""Interest"" and ""insight"" aren't objective standards. It's entirely subjective, through-and-through. If you don't like reading because you don't find it interesting, then it's not interesting to you. It's not objectively interesting whatsoever. And usually, insight and interest are matched. If something's saying something new, then it's both insightful <i>and</i> interesting, precisely for the ""different"" argument that I made before.",1227667525

377164,comment,376238,376238,0,0,Allocator2008,,,""",[.]""<p>That is a BrainF*k program. It reads a char ("",""), then if value is greater than 0 (i.e. not null since ANSI 0 is 48, so more precisely, if the input is not null, rather than greater than 0), then in that case it enters the square brackets. It outputs the entered char ("".""). It does not decrement the value in that cell (""-""), it does not add to it (""+""), it does not move the pointer to another cell ("">"" or ""<""). It just sits there and outputs, forever (""."") since so long as the value in that cell is not null it will not get out of the square brackets (the ""while"" loop) and since it never decrements the values (""-"") it will always be not null. This is the same as saying ""while(true) putchar(c)"". This program will not terminate.<p>Seems to me, go thru a program source code, and look at all loops and see if the pointer controlling the loops ever decrements the cell it is pointing to. If it does, program terminates. If it doesn't program does not terminate. If cell pointer is at overflows its capacity program blows up. There. I just solved the requirements of the ""get a coder"" posting. That will be 300 euros please (because the dollar sucks). :-)<p>More seriously, I think in terms of the requirements, it is not a matter of running f(x). It is a matter of analyzing f(x). Maybe you can't do this for all x, but surely it seems like you can for all f. Meaning, you can't test an infinite number of inputs to a given input program. But you can go thru the source code, like the above example, and determine how it will handle the input x. Feeding x into the f above will give you an infinite loop. You don't know that if all you do is feed x to f. But if you look at f first and you look at x (in this case, to know x is not null), then you can predict f(x) will infinite loop, without ever having to run it.<p>In other words the requirements are not asking for a debugger. They are asking for an oracle, i.e., an ""intelligence"" in the program smart enough to look at f, look at x, and figure ok f never stops, f does stop, or f blows up. The oracle won't run f(x). The oracle will merely analyze f(x). And she does this by simply looking for while type loops, and figuring out the affect x will have on the pointers controlling them. Will x cause the cell pointed to by the pointer to get decremented to the point of stopping an infinite loop or not? If so, f(x) halts, if not, it doesn't. Gosh, this doesn't sound so impossible (again, viewing the requirements as really asking for an oracle, not a debugger). Maybe I'm missing something here, and would welcome comments.",1227666309

Also its not the commercial competitors that will screw you, the real danger is if someone will find your project interesting, disagree with some small thing, fork it and release it as a new free open-source product, get a few more people interested to contribute so you as a one-man-shop can't keep up and thereby replace your product with a _real_ open-source product.

377161,comment,376820,377132,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Humor, as pg succinctly puts it, comes from novel breakages. (There are academic studies confirming this.) So keeping that in mind, it's possible that something can be objectively funny without anyone actually finding humor in it. (For example, if they don't see the breakage or they just don't care.)<p>Interesting works the same way. Something can be objectively interesting without anyone actually finding it interesting.<p>If this sounds funny, it's because words are defined as used. And there are certain words that are used differently than what they actually mean. For example, if I asked you for an interesting idea you wouldn't tell me the number of penguins in Antarctica, because we all accept that a fact is different than an idea. But if you look in a dictionary, you'll see the word idea defined as if it were a fact, even though we all agree that it's not. Why? Because in practice when people use the word idea it's almost always in the context of ""give me an idea of how big this room is"" or something like that. I.e., in most cases idea is used as a synonym for fact, even though we agree that this isn't what <i>an</i> idea is. You'd have to look in a really good dictionary and scroll all the way to the bottom of the list of definitions to even get a hint that this is the case, and even then they won't give you a good working definition.<p>So what is interesting? Unalone nails it when he says something different. That is, something that breaks with our mental models of how the world works, but without actually suggesting a new set of more accurate schemas (which would be insightful.)<p>I prefer reading insightful stuff to interesting stuff, which is why I say that reading stuff that's interesting (objectively) doesn't hold my (subjective) interest.",1227666056

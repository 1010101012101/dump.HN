I&#x27;m not an expert, not on drug creation nor on .. &#x27;free market&#x27; theories.<p>1) I&#x27;m not convinced that no one is interested to create the drug. Numerous people in this very discussion list issues to create a &#x27;replacement&#x27; drug, even if the patent is expired. If they are correct (see disclaimer above) that might be a reason why others haven&#x27;t tried it - or why they haven&#x27;t succeeded yet.<p>2) &#x27;Right&#x27; price is ambiguous, I agree. In my world, drug prices are ethic problems and have no connection to the so-called free market. No, a working, helping, proven drug cannot cost hundreds of $currency. We can discuss about the need to offset the R&D costs and I&#x27;m fine with drugs that costs my health insurance a ~largish~ sum, as long as the end user can get instant and easy access to the drug.<p>Your comments about putting a price on a person&#x27;s life and your opinions on drug prices - as far as I can follow! - are impossible to understand from this person&#x27;s pov. The lack of empathy and the trust in random business/market theoretical stuff to find a reasonable solution for the access to drugs that might very well save lives - that just doesn&#x27;t compute, doesn&#x27;t make sense in my world.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in free markets. I certainly don&#x27;t believe in free markets when we&#x27;re talking about the basic needs of each and every human (for the sake of the argument let&#x27;s limit this to nutrition and health for now). Health care should be free. Drugs should be affordable. Changing the price of a drug that was obviously doing okay (it was on the &#x27;free market&#x27;, right?) and multiplying the price by 65, because .. why not? .. is immoral and should be illegal. There&#x27;s no &#x27;value&#x27; to &#x27;capture&#x27;. We&#x27;re talking about a product that the company obviously produced with some sort of margin for ~13.5~ and that benefits the population at large - or at least the subset of the population that requires the drug. There is _no_ reason to increase the price, especially by that ridiculous value, other than inhuman greed. But maybe (see disclaimer) that&#x27;s what a &#x27;free market&#x27; is about - I wouldn&#x27;t know.",1442792726

I&#x27;ve only been working remotely for a few months, but here are some things I&#x27;ve learned so far:<p>1. Assuming you&#x27;ll be calling in to a lot of meetings, a good pair of headphones with a microphone is invaluable. I have and am very happy with the AKG 551, but there are lots of good options out there.<p>2. For calling in to those meetings, I love using Google Voice from the Hangouts app. Using wifi instead of cellular service is the difference between a land-line quality connection and a noisy one that drops out far too frequently. This gives you the added bonus of being able to call in to a US number for free while travelling abroad if that is something you wish to do.<p>3. For a while I felt like my employer was doing me such a favor by letting me be remote, that I owed it to them to be glued to the computer in case a chat or email message came in. Taking breaks is important. Personally, I like cooking real meals for breakfast and lunch. I find the 30-40ish minutes it takes to make something tasty are the perfect amount of time to be away from the computer and on my feet.<p>3a. Being remote isn&#x27;t a favor and it isn&#x27;t special treatment. It is simply a different negotiated work arrangment. It has the potential for enormous productivity gains but it also has the potential for less team cohesion. Personally, I think the pros outweigh the cons, but it depends on the team.<p>4.

I kind of see drones as having the same advantages, but squared - kind of like LED light bulbs compared to CFL&#x27;s, compared to incandescent.<p>However, this Bloomberg article doesn&#x27;t mention any of the downsides of drone inspection. Last time I checked (and I&#x27;ve been out of the industry for about a year), there were concerns over the quality of the photos taken by drone teams, although there is room for the technology and the skills get better there fast. The real caveat here, though, is the limited usefulness of visual inspection in an oil and gas environment. Most of the work done on-rope is UT (ultrasonic testing), which requires hands-on contact with the structure, and RT (radiographic testing), which involves lethal doses of radiation aimed in specific directions. Obviously, this would be wildly dangerous from an aircraft, and will probably never happen regardless of technology.<p>So I see a place for drones today in visual inspection of equipment while it&#x27;s online, but I can&#x27;t imagine a near-term drone-based technology that would be able to carry out UT.

lambasting the Apple Lisa, which was Apple’s first attempt to adapt
Xerox PARC technology, the graphical user interface, into a desktop
PC. I was then working on the development of APL2, a nested array,
algorithmic, symbolic language, and I was committed to the idea that
what we were doing with computers was making languages that were
better than natural languages for procedural thought. The idea was to
do for whole ranges of human thinking what mathematics has been doing
for thousands of years in the quantitative arrangement of knowledge,
and to help people think in more precise and clear ways. What I saw in
the Xerox PARC technology was the caveman interface, you point and you
grunt. A massive winding down, regressing away from language, in order
to address the technological nervousness of the user. Users wanted to
be infantilized, to return to a pre-linguistic condition in the using
of computers, and the Xerox PARC technology’s primary advantage was
that it allowed users to address computers in a pre-linguistic
way. This was to my mind a terribly socially retrograde thing to do,
and I have not changed my mind about that.</i>”<p>— Eben Moglen, interview, 2000¹<p>① <a href=""http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/1/i_moglen_1.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/1/i_moglen_1.php</a>",1442790997

As long as &quot;enough&quot; employers in field X require degrees, and as long as either a) the unemployment rate in X is low enough or b) your demonstrable skill is high enough, your value is increased by having that degree in X simply because now (non-competes, collusion pacts, and similar practices aside) there is competition for you.<p>Conversely, if you don&#x27;t have the degree, your choices for employment are (perhaps unfairly) limited - not just by the employers themselves, but also by immigration policies that limit visas for skilled work to degree-holders.  (Of course, if either of those limits were to disappear overnight, universities that have implicitly bet on rising value by rapidly increasing their tuition fees would be in deep, deep trouble, save perhaps those with virtually bottomless endowments.

10249566,comment,10249364,10249364,0,0,peckrob,,,"Routine and self-control and the biggest things.<p>Set aside certain hours that are going to be working hours. Wake up at the same time, start at the same time, eat at the same time, finish at the same time, etc. If you have the space, I&#x27;ve found it helpful to set aside a space, however small, specifically for working. I never work on the couch, for instance; I always sit at my desk. Try to find a routine that works for you and stick to it as best as possible each day. It&#x27;s very easy to slip because no one is there to tell you not to except yourself.<p>Sometimes a change of scenery is nice, so you can go someplace else. Many people like coffee shops, though I&#x27;d rather go to the park and sit at a picnic table. Coffee shops are too noisy and the wifi is usually nearly useless. Better to just go sit in a park, tether up, and enjoy the sunshine and peace.<p>Equally as important as routine is self control. It&#x27;s very easy to say &quot;I&#x27;ll just fix one more bug,&quot; and suddenly it&#x27;s 9pm and you&#x27;ve been working for 13 hours. Sometimes things happen, stuff breaks and you need to roll with that, but on normal days learn to prioritize what needs to be fixed now vs. what can wait until tomorrow. And when you log out, be done for the day. Go and enjoy life and resist that temptation to log in later that night and fix &quot;one more thing.&quot; :)<p>Take breaks. Take a walk around the block. Go out to grab a sandwich. Again, it&#x27;s easy to get sucked in when you don&#x27;t have normal workplace distractions. But sometimes those distractions are useful. Yeah, it sucks when someone interrupts you at your desk, but how often do you then decide it&#x27;s a good time for a bathroom break, or to grab a soda or snack or something? Make those things happen at home. I find a variation on pomodoro[0] to be a benefit here.<p>After work, go do something else. If possible, go out, even if it&#x27;s just to the store. Get outside and get some fresh air.<p>Do you have family? If you do here are a couple of additional points:<p>Be sure you don&#x27;t neglect your family duties. This seems counter-intuitive (because you&#x27;re at home, right!) but I&#x27;ve seen several friends relationships suffer after they started working from home (and it&#x27;s usually related to the self-control issues above - they can&#x27;t stop when it&#x27;s time to switch into family mode). Be sure your family is on board with you working from home and know what to expect.<p>But on the other hand, if your family is at home while you are home, be sure they realize that you are working and that they should _try_ not to disturb you and give you space to work. I work with a wife and 3 year old in the house and, while distractions do happen, they&#x27;re both pretty good about allowing me space and quiet to get things done. I have the fortune of having a separate space to work and, while my door is usually open for them to come and go, they know that if I&#x27;ve closed the door that means I&#x27;m trying to focus on something and to try not to disturb me.<p>Oh yeah. And keep up with your personal hygiene. There is a level of truth to this Oatmeal comic [1]. :)<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home</a>",1442790517

From running small organizations and teams and then later my own businesses, I&#x27;ve learned that &quot;no management&quot; and an &quot;anything goes&quot; mentality enables dominant personalities within the group and the dominant power structures in society to replicate itself within your organization.  That&#x27;s how you end up with all guy teams cracking jokes about hookers while they&#x27;re working and thinking that&#x27;s acceptable. Not good. I always want to set the culture myself, so that it&#x27;s thoughtful and purposeful.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re concerned not just about getting things done but about making sure that duties and compensation is fair. I&#x27;d lay out a range for compensation and clearly outline duties for each position. The younger your company is, the more wiggle room you need in duties because things change quickly. But spelling things out and communicating them clearly to folks gives them an opportunity to tell you if they think the duties to compensation ratio is unfair or let you know that duties have crept up more than they can handle.<p>And I&#x27;d set up regular reviews and check ins.

If you&#x27;re going to spend long hours at the keyboard don&#x27;t let it take a toll on your body.  If your company won&#x27;t pay for an ergonomic setup (can cost a couple grand), consider making the investment for yourself. Consider a desk that can be easily raised to a standing desk. Long hours sitting in the same position can be killer.<p>- find out what the typical working hours are for the colleagues you&#x27;ll be collaborating with the most and try to maximize your overlap with them. If you&#x27;re in very different time zones, consider working some odd hours to get more overlap.<p>- be wary of being &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot;. There may be a danger that others in your organization don&#x27;t fully appreciate your contributions, simply because they don&#x27;t see you around everyday. Those you work with directly should have a good appreciation of your value, but consider taking some additional steps to raise your profile: a) volunteer for or request higher-profile tasks that get more visibility outside your immediate group. b) if possible make trips to be onsite,

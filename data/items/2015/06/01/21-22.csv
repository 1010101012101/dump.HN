I don&#x27;t care if there&#x27;s an article reader built-in just as long as I can completely ignore it.<p>— Early on I tried logging in with some reader apps, back then it did not work and I haven&#x27;t tried in a while; I write comments so rarely on mobile that I&#x27;m happy to fall back to the browser to do it.<p>— Open sourcing a HN reader app seems like an obvious choice.<p>[0] This one, currently, it&#x27;s adequate: <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rickylaishram.hackernews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rickylaish...</a>",1433195991

9642467,comment,9642186,9642406,0,0,logicallee,,,"This is an <i>excellent</i> comment.  To be a bit more clear on jdmichal&#x27;s point, the reason for the SEC is to allow any - real - startups to be funded at all.  If you didn&#x27;t have the SEC, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to be an accredited investor and invest in all the startup offers in the world, who all have to play by the rules.  It really is a good thing.  If you&#x27;re a startup, it&#x27;s a good thing because you can just build something and monetize it, and then when you&#x27;re doing well, you can get investment in a protected investment market in a regulated way.  If you&#x27;re doing something normal.<p>I mean just juxtapose this (from the article):<p><i>&quot;For added credibility, we randomly generated trading histories for each company going all the way back to last year.....<p>We pasted descriptive text cribbed from the websites of banks and registered exchanges to make our website look like a serious business.&quot;</i><p>Source:  <a href=""https://medium.com/@eiaine/how-startup-growth-hacks-resulted-in-a-formal-investigation-from-the-sec-cd04598fe58"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@eiaine/how-startup-growth-hacks-resulted...</a><p>With what Ivanplenty said in this thread:<p><i>&quot;&#x27;Sand Hill Exchange&#x27; accepted items of real value (USD and BC) that could be used to &#x27;purchase&#x27; (or bet on) things named after real securities that trade (or are expected to trade) on public markets for a profit.&quot;</i><p>(Source <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9642353"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9642353</a>)<p>What a scary world if the SEC didn&#x27;t shut these guys down with a slap on the wrist!  (Assuming Ivanplenty is correct and they monetized as he stated.)<p>I mean they are literally inventing trading histories and collecting bitcoins and dollars to trade on them.  That&#x27;s the kind of market that sends real investors scurrying away from it, and I&#x27;m glad the SEC protects investors from that happening, by simply shutting it down.  It is positively a good thing.  (Also, the history of investor protection is because snake-oil salesmen really did take advantage of investors, selling them the clear blue sky:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_sky_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_sky_law</a><p>So it&#x27;s not like this is some theoretical thing.  The problem happened first, and the solution simply solved it.  There are a lot of areas where the legal system can improve, but the existence itself of the SEC and the fact that it shut this exchange down is not one of them.  This is absolutely warranted and called-for.  Yes, you need to register if you want to do this type of thing, and you need to play by the rules.)",1433195932

To multiply functions pointwise, you need to know their values at points.  It seems to me that &#x27;sampling&#x27; is a very good word to describe the process of evaluating a function at a lot of points.<p>> as could &quot;with respect to x&quot;, but the Calculus Gods will smite any who think of dx as a sample of x<p>Indeed not!  It is the <i>spacing</i> between sample points.  That is, the `dx` in an integral literally stands for the &quot;ghost of [the] departed quantity&quot; `x_{i + 1} - x_i` (and, in an infinitesimal approach to calculus, it doesn&#x27;t just stand for but literally <i>is</i> such a difference).",1433195856

For instance you could say the exact same thing about the internet generally and not come up with too many answers.<p>Another way to reason about it is A) how does HFT compare to the system it replaced?  and B) what would we need to give up to not have HFT (if we decided for some reason we didn&#x27;t want HFT, though I&#x27;d love to hear someone enumerate why we wouldn&#x27;t want it).<p>A is trivial to answer.  It is much, much cheaper for nearly everyone to trade with HFT than it was in the world of specialist market makers or pit traders.  In the modern world there are much less middle men for every trade and they take a dramatically lower percentage of the value than the system they replaced.

Step 2: have enough money to rent what you want, and buy food when you want.<p>Otherwise, here&#x27;s no snowboarding or woodworking hobby with a 26 liter backpack. There&#x27;s no amateur astronomy. There&#x27;s no antique sparkplug collection. There&#x27;s no home-made Bundt cake or fondue dinners. There&#x27;s no stocking up bulk foods to save money. There&#x27;s no place to store the boar meat from your hunting trip, or your hunting rifles.<p>For instance, in the summers I go on multi-week cycle camping trips. With a 26 liter backpack, I would have to rent the bike (long-distance cycles are not easy to rent), the sleeping bag and tent (or bivvy bag), and similar gear. My current lifestyle is not compatible with a 26 liter backpack.<p>That said, I once lived out of a suitcase for a year. I carried more then 12kg because my lifestyle then included having enough clothes to go out salsa or tango dancing every night, without having people wonder why I was wearing the same clothes all the time.<p>And that&#x27;s okay. There are plenty of people for whom steps 1) and 2) are entirely reasonable and appropriate. But it all boils down to 1) and 2).<p>My favorite example is Nellie Bly. She went around the world in 72 days, in the late 1880s, with &quot;the dress she was wearing, a sturdy overcoat, several changes of underwear and a small travel bag carrying her toiletry essentials. She carried most of her money (£200 in English bank notes and gold in total as well as some American currency) in a bag tied around her neck.&quot; As she wrote:<p>> &quot;After-experience showed me that I had taken too much rather than too little baggage. ... It will be seen that if one is traveling simply for the sake of traveling and not for the purpose of impressing one&#x27;s fellow passengers, the problem of baggage becomes a very simple one. On one occasion–in Hong Kong, where I was asked to an official dinner–I regretted not having an evening dress with me, but the loss of that dinner was a very small matter when compared with the responsibilities and worries I escaped by not having a lot of trunks and boxes to look after. &quot;<p>On the other hand, if you have a <i>lot</i> of money, then you can still be a &#x27;professional traveler&#x27; with no backpack - there are people who will do your shopping for you - or with a lot of trunks and boxes, that other people take care of for you.",1433194630

You get a signal from some source (looks like the author worked in news events, but the signal could be anything). If the signal indicates, via your model, that the product you are trading will go up through the best offer, you send an aggressive buy into that offer.<p>If all works out well, you get filled for a buy and the old offer (which you bought at) is now at least the best bid. Do this hundreds of times a day and you&#x27;re starting to talk about real money, especially since you can scale (to a point) by upping your quantity.<p>Sometimes you aren&#x27;t fast enough though. That buy you sent into the best offer is too slow - it merely appears as a buy at what is now the best bid (or doesn&#x27;t at all if you use an IOC - immediate or cancel), and you get no trade. Even if you only get filled on 20% of the signals, if they are on average good, then you still make money.<p>This is just one type of strategy though.

People think there&#x27;s something deeper in it than the most straightforward explanation. Or maybe they think they missed some critical detail and are afraid to ask.<p>I like your conclusion and I think it&#x27;s something anyone involved with hiring practices should think about more.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m the type of person a hedge fund would be looking for, but I would freeze on that question: My first thought would be, I wouldn&#x27;t be willing to pay to play the game with &quot;some guy&quot; at all. But knowing that&#x27;s probably not what you&#x27;re getting at, instead I&#x27;m going to have to look for a solution to a problem I&#x27;ve never encountered.<p>But it goes deeper than that: If someone were to walk up to me and offer to play the game I just could say &quot;No, thanks.&quot; and life goes on, a simple and low stress life decision. In a job interview I may be desperate, or at least hopeful, for the job; no thanks isn&#x27;t going to cut it. You may not realize it, or intend it, but your warm up is asking how I face new challenges in life. No pressure.<p>Since the situation is new and hypothetical I&#x27;ve also got to consider the hypothetical details. These hypothetical details can branch widely and deeply, reaching into both the hypothetical world you&#x27;ve prompted and the reality that I&#x27;m being evaluated without knowing what you are looking for. E.g. Is it a loaded die? That would mean the question is loaded so, no that&#x27;s a silly question; unless that&#x27;s exactly the kind of thinking you&#x27;re looking for, in which case it&#x27;s an essential question.<p>Further, I know you already know the answer, and the trick if there is one, so the question might seem simple to you and you might not understand why I don&#x27;t also just get it (which you admit). This means bad starts and bad questions can make me look bad which I definitely don&#x27;t want (So, yes, I think there may be a critical detailed I missed, and I&#x27;m afraid to ask).<p>This probably isn&#x27;t how you or other interviewers intend for candidates to respond to questions. One solution is for candidates to work on &quot;interviewing skills&quot; and get better at provided simple, canned answers. This makes sense if these interviewing skills part of the job but otherwise, in my opinion, distracts from exploring the candidate&#x27;s talents and doesn&#x27;t really give a good sense of company fit.<p>Alternatively, the interviewer could make their intentions and expectations clear for the candidate. For example, send the candidates your warm up questions a week in advance to let them prepare for the interview. When they get there ask them what they came up with and then probe them with deeper questions that get at what you really want to learn. Those who worked on your problems will be better prepared to talk about it.<p>I would like to see interviews try to draw out the skills the candidates possess and determine if they would benefit the company, rather then being a Company Exam. This might mean letting the candidate actually work with the team on a small problem, or just providing guidance and feedback to help them feel more comfortable talking with you rather than feeding you answers. For example, step them through the original dice game and then ask them to consider the variations.<p>EDIT: Fixed typos.",1433193466

9642151,comment,9640086,9642018,0,0,acomjean,,,"Even while running the radar would keep track of communications between the parts and make sure things were still ok.  The system needed messages periodically from the external components and vice versa to make sure things were ok.  There were status messages sent around too. And a display of how things were doing.  Its been a while, but I remember some of the things.<p>You could command the external things to run diagnostics and report back.  Part of this was it makes fixing things easier (like your car computer&#x27;s diagnostics), part of it was required so we can figure out where things weren&#x27;t working optimally.<p>For example if a motor was running its controller computer didn&#x27;t hear from the main system in X seconds, it would just stop, send a message about what it was doing and then wait for an instruction.  Presumably  this was to prevent all heck from breaking loose if the main system went down or was not responsive.<p>This was all spelled out in long requirements documents.<p>I wonder sometime if our cars controlling computers are doing this...",1433192757

I&#x27;ve had good success with it.<p>Of course there&#x27;s a certain level of destructive testing you can&#x27;t do live, but that you really ought to do on your development system, load testing being a simple example. It behooves the wise developer to keep these quite separated in the code. :)",1433192603

The Institute of Medicine recommends 38g/day in men [1].<p>They reduced fiber in v1.4 because it was causing flatulence in some people. This is probably because those people were already eating a very low-fiber (unhealthy) diet; the gut microbiome would adjust given more time.<p>I am very enthusiastic about Soylent and currently use it (with a fiber supplement). However, I can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it to other people without that caveat.

9642127,comment,9640086,9641898,0,0,jerf,,,"This is why this discussion sometimes frustrates me. A lot of the defects we have are because you aren&#x27;t willing to pay for the sort of software that wouldn&#x27;t have defects. It&#x27;s natural to read that as a sort of cynical accusation, but instead, I mean it straight... you really aren&#x27;t willing to pay what it would take, and you shouldn&#x27;t be. A $1000 Facebook-access app for your phone (that still somehow has some sort of economies of scale going for it, but that&#x27;s another discussion) might not crash on you and might take a lot fewer phone resources, but there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s going to be $1000 better than what we get today for free for the vast bulk of users.<p>On the flip side, the cavalier attitude developers who are on the very, very low side of the curve, where huge quality improvements can be obtained for very cheap, towards those cheap practices also frustrates me. What do you mean you can&#x27;t be bothered to run the automated test suite that I have handed you on a silver platter on your build server? Are you serious? How can you pass up something so cheap, yet so powerful? And I don&#x27;t just mean, how can you not be bothered to set it up, etc... I mean, as a professional engineer, how can you justify that?",1433192487

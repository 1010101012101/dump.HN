We could end up being surprised that a given company still has the .com suffix. &quot;It&#x27;s a small one, they don&#x27;t have money&quot;, we&#x27;ll think.</i><p>Precisely, and one of the many reasons gTLDs are so distasteful.  It marginalizes smaller businesses that cannot (yet) afford to play with the big-boys who throw around $185,000 as if it&#x27;s nothing.  Prior to this, domain registration was <i>mostly</i> a level playing field of first-come-first-served.<p>In a world where we often decry regulation that may benefit big business over small business, ICANN pulled this stunt which is egregiously and by design biased toward big business and it was more or less ignored by everyone.<p>Above, you pointed out that .canon is distinct from .dev because Canon is a trademarked name.  Although I understand trademarks have been used to dislodge domain squatters, I believe that&#x27;s extremely rare.  Making a distinction between trademarks and generic terms creates ambiguity.  The gray area of deciding between a company named &quot;DEV&quot; wanting to (or more likely feeling they <i>need to</i>) spend $185,000 to protect their identity and a domain registrar wanting to spend $185,000 to sell subdomains in &quot;dev&quot; is yet another reason gTLDs were a bad idea.",1425145924

9124339,comment,9119162,9124194,0,0,Arathorn,,,"Interesting - this is new to me (and ironic, given Aether was a candidate name for Matrix!).  The projects seem very similar in some ways - both python/twisted/sqlite server stacks + angular frontend.  The big differences seem to be that Aether is using AMP as its federation protocol rather than Matrix&#x27;s HTTP/JSON federated DAGs, and is focused initially on forums rather than IM/VoIP.  It&#x27;s a bit strange that it advertises itself as entirely peer-to-peer though, when seemingly it is very much a client-server model (with server/server federation) just like Matrix, SMTP or XMPP.  It&#x27;s also slightly strange that the github repo is only showing certain drops from a private repo - I wonder why the dev isn&#x27;t happening in the open.  It&#x27;s also hard to see what the actual decentralisation algorithm is, beyond replication.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be using DAGs for eventual consistency or signing forum history.<p>In terms of anti-spam proof-of-work stuff, identity, sybil attacks and all the good stuff mentioned at <a href=""http://blog.getaether.net/post/101566226287/a-few-updates-about-aether-and-whats-next"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.getaether.net/post/101566226287/a-few-updates-ab...</a> it sounds like Aether & Matrix are at a fairly similar point.

I can&#x27;t believe you guys are seriously having a problem with it. It describes the story well.<p>Third, from what I heard when first getting into this story, it WAS the oldest known living organism on Earth. Since then they have found older &quot;things&quot;, and having found the Prometheus tree, they have found older tree(s) as well looking in the same area as well as areas that have the same general living conditions.<p>Fourth, I&#x27;m sharing a link, not writing a freaking thesis. I&#x27;m glad at least someone on this thread bothered to find out about this story because it&#x27;s fascinating.<p>Fifth, for those who are more interested in the story than semantics about titles, there is a hero, Mike Drakulich, from the Parks Service who refused to cut down the tree. He even took his chainsaw with him because he didn&#x27;t want them to cut it down. They found another Park Ranger to do it the next day. I met Mike&#x27;s daughter at the memorial. It was quite touching. Here&#x27;s another version of that story.

As you say it can be a lot of fun if your clients have interesting problems and rely on you to clarify and reify their ideas. I can confirm that world has not died out, and I suspect it won&#x27;t, because there will always be a stage where people have some money to spend but not enough to take a risky bet on an untested idea and start hiring employees, which is a huge fixed cost - consultants will always be better for that sort of work.<p>When they&#x27;re spending other people&#x27;s money, of course companies are more willing to take on employees and fixed costs even at the start, so in some ways VC funding does distort this market.<p><i>The problem I&#x27;ve run into lately is the large number of people who are so sure that their idea will someday be worth billions that they do not want to pay cash right now, they only want to pay in equity.

If they went for minutes instead of seconds, it&#x27;s possible that a leap minute would be added once per century (or less); entire generations of computer scientists would not have to deal with it and Google could come and go (for good) without ever having to shift their clocks.<p>Humans don&#x27;t really care if you add a minute at midnight of new years eve, in fact, it could even be fun to countdown twice for the new year, but for computers it would be a massive saving of engineering effort.",1404205149

What isn&#x27;t being asked is: why are humans using that road when they weren&#x27;t using the smaller road before?<p>Humans don&#x27;t just drive for the sake of doing so. They drive because they have the need to do so. Building roads lowers the perceived time cost of driving, so more people drive, and more people drive at the time that is most desirable to do so. In some cases this results in increased congestion, but if the need of the population is met or exceeded, then the result is smooth traffic flow. Even if the bigger road is more congested, it may still have a greater net traffic flow, and that increased flow results in greater economic and societal good.<p>For example, because of new highway XYZ, I can now work somewhere that was formerly too far a commute.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t solved by building smaller roads, it&#x27;s solved by building even bigger roads, or building roads in a more optimal fashion (selecting a route for a new road that matches the transportation needs of the population).",1404204431

7969675,comment,7969301,7969358,5,0,kmfrk,,,"Seriously, just skim it; it&#x27;s not boring legalese:<p>>1. The founders of a red-hot technology startup named Tinder engaged in atrocious sexual harassment and sex discrimination against Whitney Wolfe, the young woman who co- founded Tinder and was the face of Tinder in magazines and in Tinder’s efforts to market the company to other young women. Tinder’s Chief Marketing Officer Justin Mateen repeatedly called Ms. Wolfe a “whore,” including in front of CEO Sean Rad, and he told Ms. Wolfe that he was taking away her “Co-Founder” title because having a young female co-founder “makes the company seem like a joke” and “devalues” the company.<p>><p>>2. Mr. Mateen and Mr. Rad subjected Ms. Wolfe to a barrage of horrendously sexist, racist, and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages, including describing one person as a “liberal lying desperate slut” and others as “middle age Muslim pigs” and referring, for example, to “fucking” the wife of a prominent blogger, and a text depicting IAC Chairman Barry Diller as a penis. Although it is tempting to describe the conduct of Tinder’s senior executives as “frat-like,” it was in fact much worse- representing the worst of the misogynist, alpha-male stereotype too often associated with technology startups.<p>><p>>3. Although Ms. Wolfe repeatedly complained to CEO Rad, he ignored her complaints, dismissing her as “annoying” and “dramatic,” and threatened her job. Ms. Wolfe finally broke down the night that Mr. Mateen called her a “whore” at a company event, and she offered to resign in consideration for modest severance and the vesting of her stock. Mr. Rad snidely rejected the offer and fired her.",1404204230

7969634,comment,7965759,7965759,2,0,mrow84,,,"I have a couple of questions for the people on here who actually understand all this stuff.<p>The argument, as I understand it, for why it is useful to have HFTs in markets like the one in the article, is that they provide extra liquidity. My understanding of liquidity is that it is some kind of measure of how quickly an asset can be sold. I&#x27;m sure there are some formal definitions, but that has to be something like [asset value/sale time], where larger is more liquid.<p>It seems to me, though, that liquidity is necessarily very time-scale dependent. For example, there is basically no liquidity in any market at the picosecond (or whatever is faster than current trading) timescale, because (by definition) no-one trades that fast. So really, although liquidity can be calculated as a rate, it is more appropriate to look at the distribution of available liquidity over different time scales. In other words, being able to sell $10 of assets in 10 days is not really the same as being able to sell $1 of assets every day for 10 days.<p>My questions are:<p>1) is my understanding of liquidity as being timescale dependent correct, and if not, why not?<p>2) if yes, what is the social value of &quot;faster&quot; liquidity?<p>3) if &quot;faster&quot; liquidity has greater social value, is there any point at which the cost of maintaining that liquidity (which is what I understand HFT profits to be) exceeds the value of having liquidity at that timescale?<p>edit: spacing for visual clarity",1404202653

In many companies you can hear people saying &quot;it&#x27;s nothing personal, just business&quot; (you also hear the same from movie villains, oh well).<p>At Apple, for as long as I remember, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite: it&#x27;s not just business, it&#x27;s always personal.<p>If you hurt Apple, Apple will hurt you back.<p>You can think of Apple as a smart, powerful, spoiled prince/princess. If you have something the prince(ss) wants, they&#x27;ll try to be friends with you and shower you with gifts. But if you go this path you better never end up on their bad side.<p>It may seem childish to some, but as far as game theory goes, this kind if behavior makes one&#x27;s choices and outcomes very clear when you interact with Apple.",1404202535

T2 instances are a new low-cost, General Purpose instance type that are designed to provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline. With On-Demand Instance prices starting at $0.013 per hour ($9.50 per month), T2 instances are the lowest-cost Amazon EC2 instance option and are ideal for web servers, developer environments, and small databases.\nT2 instances are for workloads that don&#x27;t use the full CPU often or consistently, but occasionally need to burst to higher CPU performance. Many applications such as web servers, developer environments, and small databases don&#x27;t need consistently high levels of CPU, but benefit significantly from having full access to very fast CPUs when they need them. T2 instances are engineered specifically for these use cases.<p>T2 instances are available in three sizes: t2.micro, t2.small, and t2.medium and work well in combination with Amazon EBS General Purpose (SSD) volumes for instance block storage.<p>T2 instances are backed by the latest Intel Xeon processors with clock speeds up to 3.3GHz during burst periods. If you are currently using T1 or M1 instances, we encourage you to try T2 instances for better performance for many applications at a lower cost.<p>T2 instances are available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Australia (Sydney), and Brazil (Sao Paulo) regions and are coming soon to all other AWS Regions. T2 instances can be purchased as On-Demand and Reserved Instances. To learn more about Amazon EC2 T2 instances, see the Amazon EC2 details page.<p>--------<p>Also, at this moment these new instances don&#x27;t seem to be available yet, at least not in EU.",1404202080

He would have picked better women to get involved with. Now he&#x27;s got a relationship that works, and it&#x27;s about time.<p>Wisdom is the thing that lets you see the essential quality that makes the important things in life important.

I've always said that it has 80% of what I like about larger cities but only 20% of what I hate.  There's a surprising amount of good food, a growing and active hacker community, it's a short drive to tahoe, and SF is just a day trip when you need it, and coming from the northeast the weather is fantastic.<p>At the same time people here think a 20 minute commute is outrageous, the cost of living is insanely cheap, and the majority of the city is extremely safe.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm never going to argue that, as a city, Reno competes with any larger US cities. But imho it beats that hell out of anywhere that has a similar cost of living.  Most people I know in larger cities tend to move an hour or two into the suburbs as they get older and end up making time to get into the city very rarely, I'd definitely take Reno over that.<p>I don't think Reno is the greatest place on earth, but I can never understand why people despise it so much more than anywhere else.",1333860632

In 3 organizations, I rose to the position of CTO and it was never my ambition. My experience has colored my outlook, but I believe that smart solutions and hard work will elevate you. I have read countless articles about the politics of promotions here on HN, but I take little stock in them. At your current organization think like a businessman, identify the biggest pain points in the organization and fix them, fix them on your free time if you have to.

3813088,comment,3809836,3811921,1,0,robomartin,,,"The analogy was not intended to be strict.  That is impossible.<p>What you want, really, might be akin to the car company releasing the full design files of the car to you when you buy the car.  What's the difference between source code for software and source code (the design) for making a car or a refrigerator these days.  I fire-up Solidworks and can design a car.  I fire-up various compilers and write the embedded code that runs the engine control systems, etc.<p>To create Linux, PHP or any piece of software you have teams of programmers in front of computers typing away.  The case is the same for designing a car or a microwave oven.<p>Are you suggesting that Samsung should grant you the ability to download all the design files for that $69 microwave you bought at Walmart?  Probably not.  Why not?  It's the same thing.  I have spent years designing products that combine hardware and software.  I've done it all in front of a computer.  Exactly as I do when I code a website or an iPhone app.  No difference.  So, then, why treat them any different?  Why aren't the proponents of free/freedom also not buying cars or supporting microwave oven makers than don't release their design files.<p>Ridiculous you say?  So be it.  It may very well be that it is not I who isn't getting it.  My world is complete and equitable because I understand, like, support and promote that BOTH points of view are part of a symbiotic relationship.  You cannot have free/freedom without paid/closed.  Period.<p>I noticed that you neglected to mention my observations about you bringing up that MS was the largest contributor to the Linux kernel last year.  You, with that, made my point with absolute precision:  The largest contributor to Linux last year could afford to do so because they earn a revenue stream from another paid activity.  And, in this case, it happens to be paid/closed software.<p>Again, I propose that the extremist view that ALL software ought to be free or free+freedom is simply not realistic and actually counterproductive.<p>What do you think would happen if someone like RMS came out and said something like:  ""I've decided to start supporting MS products because they enable MS to make significant and valuable contributions to the FOSS software community""<p>I'd bet you a good cup of coffee that you'd see a huge boost in the amount of FOSS work coming out of MS and others.<p>If you look at what RMS represents you can't help but cringe.  He's actually proud of working with a piece of crap computer that is probably a decade behind the times.  In his  world the millions of people that have gained and continue to enjoy employment due to the evolution and improvements of paid/closed platforms and software would not have jobs.  It's a joke.<p>I come from the vantage point of having designed and built my own computers down to the chip level.  Having literally wire-wrapped my own boards.  Designed my own disk controller cards and written my own OS and applications.  So, I'll say that I have some skin in the game.  And, yes, I know that a 1GHz machine with very lean software can do quite a bit.  I was running AutoCAD on a CP/M system with 64K of RAM and a two-card math co-processor and RAM disk with 640K of memory.  And I did a lot of good work with that.  But, you know, today, I gladly pay thousands of dollars a year for licenses to programs such as SolidWorks and Altium Designer to get my work done.  They are amazing and do a great job.  They represent a tremendous amount of R&D and expertise in the field.  And, no, I don't care to have the source code and don't really give a shit if they don't want to release it.  It's their product and they should be entitled to do with it as they please.  My annual license fees get me continued and consistent improvement and support.<p>We might want to agree to disagree at this point.",1333860137

I hope with enough preventative measures i'll never have to deal with something like that.<p>First scenario: First priority is to branch and patch the hole asap. There's no point dealing with this if someone else is going to put you back in this position a month later. Make sure everyone in the company is on the same page, and then unfortunately i'd probably attempt to verify that the request was legitimate, and ask for proof with the pretence of being willing to pay.. Try and think of some way to make the information useless to the perpetrator, but in the end, i probably would pay up (under some contract) and maybe offer employment as well.<p>Could possibly whip up a bug reporting program, with well-defined rewards in the vicinity of what was being asked, and give the perpetrator a nondescript shrug toward it. That way the perpetrator gets an easy, moral way out, which is almost as important.<p>Second scenario: Security audit, change all passwords, IP restrict logins, re-encrypt all user passwords on login. Hopefully there was no sensitive data - then i would wait it out to see if it turns into scenario one. It would be embarassing to send out apologies + service credits if it wasn't malicious (not just e.g. the hosting provider doing maintenance, someone using a proxy, someone working out at a client's site, a contractor's ip you've overlooked, etc)<p>It always feels like someone's done the right thing when you read stories about services notifying all their users, forcing password changes, and so on.

Document them clearly.  Make the top-level the name of your library.  ""libname.foo"", ""libname.bar"", ""libname.baz"" are fine.  Just use only one top-level namespace.<p>Use the logging levels appropriately. (Some libraries log everything as ""warning"", that's almost as bad as no logging.)<p>""Turn it off by default"" - unless you are making a lib where performance is critical, logging overhead is noise.  Your containing process will set up handlers as appropriate - they can turn off your output if they know what your loggers are.<p>For bonus points, provide logging configurations for ""silent"", ""normal"", and ""debug"".<p>I agree that the logging stdlib is a bit heavy for many uses.

Plenty of universal apps use the @2x iphone target images for the iPad display, for example, and this suggestion would break those apps.<p>As a developer, I've been more and more often leaning towards using tools like paintCode or just writing code for custom widgets instead of trying to make the 4 different images for iphone/ipad/iphone@2x/ipad@2x. This is a win/win because it looks better (except at very low res) and keeps the size of the app down.<p>Having the app store serve different apps for different target devices opens a can of worms. For example, if you backed up on one device and restored on another, you could get the wrong one. I think Apple made the right choice in preferring to make sure your apps work everywhere rather than save storage at the cost of complexity.

No! This is a complete waste of money.  Our cities are just not built to make use of something like this.  The various stake holders (environmental groups, politicians, industry, unions, etc.) all but make sure that these projects will cost ten times more than they should and end-up in exactly the wrong places.  And, because of this, not enough people will use them.<p>Take the proposal that was floating around a while ago (maybe still is) to build a high-speed rail connection between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Maybe it is a good idea, I don't know.  Here's the problem.  The start point in LA is Central Station. That's Downtown Los Angeles.  In other words, an hour to two hours away from this great mass of people living in the area.  That is, if you even want to consider going Downtown (it ain't like Downtown San Francisco).  I know I have absolutely zero interest in driving 50 miles to get on a train.  Heck, I avoid LAX like the plague.<p>Don't get me wrong.  I'd love to see mass transportation akin to what they have in Europe.  On my most recent trip I took the train from Amsterdam to Munich.  I was great.  I think that Europe evolved into this infrastructure while we evolved into something else.<p>Take a city like Amsterdam and look at the light rail going everywhere. And take a look at the tens of thousands of bikes running around.  That bike parking lot in Dam Square across from Central Station is simply amazing.  Their culture and way of life have evolved around these ideas.  Try to bring something like that into a megalopolis like Los Angeles and you'll fail.  The place simply was not built with this kind of thinking in the first place.  Heck, I drive 60 miles a day just picking up my kids from school!<p>I would like to see a transition to something more sensible than what we are doing today.  I really would.  I just don't think that high-speed rail is the way to do it and, therefore, think that investing in it would be a complete waste of money and resources.<p>If you want to feed money into something that has the potential to make great changes given our way of life and culture, send your monthly check to companies like Tesla.  We desperately need to move away from these horrible, polluting and inefficient gasoline engines into something that provides greater options in terms of where energy might come from and could just be better for the environment.<p>When in Europe do as the Europeans.

People in the United States are all too insulated from the reality of people in many other countries having to learn everything we do, including literacy in a native language, to make a living, AND having to learn English to a good standard of literacy besides. Yes, people in other countries often take university-level classes in a variety of subjects with the same English-language textbooks used by American students at the best American universities. (There is, of course, a thriving business in those countries of cram books of those subjects and digests of those textbooks in the local language, and also many excellent textbooks in the local language in many countries.) Moreover, a lot of people in a lot of parts of the world converse in their parents in some historically traditional language of their country, but do business and make jokes with business colleagues in conversational English.<p>I'm an American who spent several years of my life learning Chinese, among other languages, and who has lived in non-English-speaking places for about six years of my life and worked for quite a few years in the United States in translation and interpreting.

I have not had TV in a long time, so that's not a problem, but whenever I've momentarily had no internet I find I eat better, exercise more, have a cleaner house, and knock more things off of my to do lists.<p>It's not that I want to go without internet, it's just that I do not want the internet at home.  I've been without it before and really enjoyed the experience, now I just have to make the leap of canceling internet completely.",1333857959

7029187,comment,7028415,7029005,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"Inflation: A producer should hoard goods because it will (likely) be worth more tomorrow than it is today. In the mean time they have to spend money to maintain storage of the good. They have to maintain the condition of the goods so it&#x27;s still useful when they sell it. They have to pay people to maintain these things. Which means eventually they have to <i>sell</i> something in order to pay these costs associated with their hoarding. Very few goods (outside of raw materials like metals) can sit around for years at a time and <i>gain</i> value. If it&#x27;s food, it&#x27;ll rot. If it&#x27;s a technology good, it&#x27;ll be obsoleted. Even oil and many other non-dietary consumables will succumb to decay of some sort over time.<p>Deflation: A consumer should hoard cash because it will (likely) be worth more tomorrow than it is today. Outside of home security they don&#x27;t need much to store it. They&#x27;ll eventually spend some of it, because they need to eat and feed and clothe their family. But overall, the hoarding here is relatively cheap.<p>These may both be rational positions, but they are not <i>equivalent</i> positions or mirrors of each other.

And math often uses programming. But, in a deeper sense, programming <i>is</i> math and math <i>is</i> programming. They&#x27;re just different views on the same underlying ideas. They&#x27;re different fields of study mainly because the <i>priorities</i> are so different.<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean it makes sense to map Objective-C programming onto some &quot;level&quot; of math. For one, the whole math scale is completely arbitrary--who is to say that abstract algebra is more advanced than calculus? They&#x27;re orthogonal. Moreover, Objective-C is in a part of programming which has <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> different priorities from normal mathematics. I still maintain that they&#x27;re fundamentally related, but you&#x27;re doing such different things that there&#x27;s very little practical overlap.

However companies that practice dual-licensing and that require copyright assignment for contributions do not have to play by the same rules as the third-parties that are contributing and I think this is poisonous.<p>It&#x27;s a good business strategy of course, however, how many times have you heard of such a company that does profit sharing with the third-parties that contributed code? It&#x27;s also bad for the company ... if some third-party releases some really good plugin as GPL, without doing copyright assignment, then it means the plugin in question will never be a part of the official distribution, which hurts all parties.<p>This is why I prefer the open core model, in which anybody can build proprietary things on top. For example IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is licensed with the Apache 2.0 license. Apache 2.0 is IMHO the best open-source license. IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate edition includes all kinds of smarts and JetBrains is doing well - it obviously doesn&#x27;t hurt them when third-parties release plugins such as this one: <a href=""http://cursiveclojure.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cursiveclojure.com/</a> - it actually helps them, because they don&#x27;t have the resources to build plugins for everything under the sun.<p>BTW - I&#x27;m happy that LightTable was released as open-source. I would have preferred another license, preferably one that is compatible with EPL (that&#x27;s pervasive in Clojure&#x27;s ecosystem), but can&#x27;t complain, it&#x27;s their right to do as they please.",1389250030

7029113,comment,7019914,7028697,2,0,SEJeff,,,"Please forget enterprise. It is used and misconstrued until it means nothing. Lets talk about manageability. How do you (easily) manage 1000 gentoo (or arch linux) servers? You could have a distcc farm to build your base distro from stage1 (if you needed to) or just copy down the binary stage 3 builds and then bootstrap using binary ebuilds, but it is still a whole lot more difficult than a full binary distribution such as Redhat or Debian. Dealing with large clusters of servers, the tools that they include or write and then open source are what really blow me back.<p>Just a few in no particular order:<p>- the RHEL kernel. Redhat has consistently topped the list of Linux kernel contributors for years. The first google hits for it were <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/451243/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/451243/</a> and <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/507986/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/507986/</a>, but that hasn&#x27;t changed for a looooong time. They basically have as much of a monopoly on core Linux kernel develops as is possible in such a large complex project. Quite literally, there isn&#x27;t a company in the world with more Linux development chops than Redhat. If you run critical applications on Redhat servers (think banking or wall street exchanges like NASDAQ or hospital systems that downtime could result in real problems), Redhat will be able to fix it if anyone can. I&#x27;m not pretending working with Redhat support is fun, but they are better equipped from an engineering standpoint than virtually anyone. The numbers back that up. Due to this, the Redhat kernel is an interesting hybrid of slightly older and battle tested stable with newer features backported. This is achieved because super often the people who write the features upstream tend to be redhat employees, so they do both. If I was asked to pick one thing that set RHEL / Redhat / CentOS apart, it would be the work that goes into their kernel for QA and testing / backporting. Look at a company like Canonical, they have a bit more than a dozen (<a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam</a>) kernel developers. They simply can&#x27;t compete on engineering resources due to their limited number of engineers. As a result (and a smart business move) the are more consumers of patches from upstream than producers. Also, look at the lwn &quot;who wrote linux X.YY&quot; articles. You&#x27;ll rarely and almost never find Canonical on that list except for when they got the apparmor patches merged (props to them!).<p>- sssd[1] - a solid implementation that essentially unifies pam ldap/kerberos, pam_ccreds/nslcd/nscd/pam_access all in one very nice implementation. This makes (for instance) joining your Linux nodes into an Active Directory domain (without using commercial software from likewise or some other cruddy vendor) just work out of the box. It also makes single-sign-on and migration from standard ldap to kerberized ldap (a very hard problem) super duper simple.<p>- cobbler[2] (and now the foreman[3]) - These tools along with redhat&#x27;s kickstart make pxebooting a cluster of 500 new servers very trivial to turn into 500 new ready to use for production servers. Gentoo has nothing I&#x27;m aware of that allows installing completely automated like kickstart, but someone please enlighten me via a reply if this is incorrect. Michael Dehaan (big HN commenter and wrote the ansible config management tool) wrote cobbler.<p>- abrtd[4] / faf[5] - abrtd will collect crash reports (segfaults, coredumps, python tracebacks, kernel oopses, etc) and parse the info / store the relevant bits locally or forward on to a faf server. It will allow you to things (for example) like figuring out easily every single system that is reporting a specific kernel oops, which is then tracked down to a specific type of hardware and kernel combination. Sure there are tools like crash and netdump, but abrtd is simply a very modular management tool ontop of all of those things. The public fedora project faf is located at: <a href=""https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/problems/hot/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://retrace.fedoraproject.org/faf/problems/hot/</a>. faf is good stuff<p>- freeipa[6] - Honestly up until this project, Linux never had anything that competed with Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory for a turn key easy to setup and manage kerberized ldap user and group / policy management product. IPA changes that and integrates very well with Microsoft AD through a kerberos level trust. sssd (above) is the ipa client. It allows true single sign on between Linux and Windows clients, something that is still elusive for most companies.<p>- standards. Linux&#x27;s biggest strength is also it&#x27;s achilles heel. Not having package standards or kernel standards (or stability) prevented a lot of companies from using Linux or certifying their software for Linux early on. Being very conservative in what they will support and supporting it for very long periods of time allowed companies like Oracle (as a horrible example) to port their database to Linux and certify that things are good. Try getting big complex commercial pieces of software working on a build your own distro. It is possible, but is buyer beware. Redhat made this their business model and has done a great job of it. At this point, Debian has also done a wonderful job at standardizing things and being consistent, albeit different, from Redhat.<p>TL;DNR: Redhat is building tools that make Linux easier to deploy and easier to manage in large &quot;enterprise&quot; environments. These tools make it equally easy to manage in smaller environments. No single entity has pushed Linux further in the &quot;enterprise&quot; than Redhat. I could list plenty more, but this hopefully answers your question fully. If not, click through to my profile, find my resume, and from it shoot me an email.<p>[1] <a href=""https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cobblerd.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cobblerd.org</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://theforeman.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theforeman.org</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/abrt/abrt/wiki/ABRT-Project"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/abrt/abrt/wiki/ABRT-Project</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/abrt/faf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/abrt/faf</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page</a>",1389248888

It&#x27;s also good value for money.<p>This is my second IKEA chair in the GBP170 to GBP220 price range - I don&#x27;t remember the name of the previous one which I purchased in 2002 and continued to use until late 2011. The old one has been relegated to &quot;guest worker&quot; chair after a refurb of new wheels. The seat padding could do with replacing/recovering but it&#x27;s good enough for 2-3 hour sessions.<p>I work from home full time so my desk chair gets used in anger for at least 8-10 hours a day six/seven days a week, also I&#x27;m a fairly large 6&#x27; bloke so they do take a pounding.

I had to be responsible for the gun for the whole 1997, but shot only few times, since the country was going through hard period, and we were not allowed much ammo. Also had to make sure that I shoot on manual, or was it semi-automatic. From what I remember I had to get used to my weapon, as each one was uniquely biased, so you had to understand yourself how it shoots. Had to clean it every day at 2:00pm, and had to cover disassembling and assembling it for some relatively short time (actual times escape me, but was somewhere in the dozen of seconds to a minute).<p>Losing the gun was punishable by 7 years military prison (or at least that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve told us). Also while guarding and if someone was approaching you should first fire an alert bullet (if that&#x27;s the right name) up in the air, and then shoot at place (if the object keeps moving).<p>I did not even cared about it. Later I was supposed to be with RPG-9, but since the major and the captain of the brigade discovered my typing and computer skills I was put in an &quot;ad-hoc&quot; position - sleeping in the same room with all drivers, cooks, etc, while just doing computer stuff and delivering the mail from the city (along with starting the wood stove, and some cleaning).",1389247449

There's probably a trick available via coroutines, because coroutine.yield() yields to the caller of the currently running coroutine, rather than to the caller of the currently running function.<p>Making anonymous function creation less verbose is a popular topic on the Lua mailing list. ""function (args) return args end"" is more verbose than ""do |args| args end"". There are several implementations via community-developed macro extensions. I wouldn't be surprised to see something appear in the Lua 5.2 RC candidate later this year.<p>In the real world, I'd probably write something like this in Lua:<p><pre><code>  function which_answer_is_correct (...)\n      return table.find({...}, function (value) return tostring(value) == 42 end)\n  end\n</code></pre>\nImplementation of table:find(cond) is left as an exercise for the reader.",1219435233

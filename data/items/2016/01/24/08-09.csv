It&#x27;d be great for more of this data to be available online for people to study and work with.<p>There are many anonymized datasets available on Radiopaedia. <a href=""http://radiopaedia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radiopaedia.org/</a> I&#x27;ve spent quite a bit of time studying neurological conditions on that site and on wikipedia. Those are more useful, but anonymized. I&#x27;m not sure that there are many healthy MRI datasets available there, which makes it more difficult to statistically model MRI data.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to use Nipy and Dipy to create visualizations of my brain.  In particular, i&#x27;m hoping to recreate some of the Diffusion Tensor Imaging work in this talk by Ariel Rokem: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdrSZtB0uX0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdrSZtB0uX0</a>.  However, i&#x27;m not sure if my DT images are high enough resolution.<p>I also did it for philosophical reasons. I believe that all digitized information past and present will be inevitably become known & public post facto. It&#x27;s the nature of information & knowledge in our technological world to distribute itself until the world converges on total information omnipresence. So if, in the end, all [digitized] information is known, then there is no point in hiding information. This is more of a philosophical viewpoint though.  obviously it&#x27;s impossible for all information to converge in this way.<p>But this is true even of our own minds. And if our mind can be digitized from our brain, this also has interesting security implications.

The actual thing is that the rules enforce a discipline about data, similar to the discipline in functional languages (except here it&#x27;s allowing sharing XOR mutation instead of forbidding mutation entirely). This discipline gets us many things -- memory safety, safety from iterator invalidation-y things (there&#x27;s a whole class of memory safety bugs that happen when you modify the exterior of a things whilst holding a pointer to the interior -- from iterator invalidation to invalidating pointers to a vector after truncation to invalidating enums), and clarity in code. Whilst the chronology of it&#x27;s design may not be such, I personally look at data race freedom as something we got for free from this discipline, instead of the core focus of it.",1453625485

Where Jaynes demonstrates that increased evidence actually decreases your belief in a hypothesis.<p>Jaynes gives an example of an experiment in which a psychic predicts cards, getting n out of m correct. In classical hypothesis testing H0 would be &quot;the psychic got lucky&quot; and H1 is &quot;the psychic has mystic powers&quot;. Jaynes first attempts to use Bayesian reasoning to work backward to determine your prior belief in psychics. That is, how much evidence would it take to convince you, compare that to the raw likelihood and what you have is your prior beliefs quantified.<p>He then points out that he personally would never believe the subject was psychic, this is because there are not just H0 and H1, but H2 &quot;the psychic is deceiving the experimenters&quot;, H3 &quot;the experimenters are making an error&quot; , H4 &quot;the experiments are fudging the results&quot;, H5 ... Each of these has their own prior.<p>If your prior for believing in psychics is low enough and your prior for &quot;the experimenters are fraud&quot; is high enough, the more extreme the evidence the more you will be convinced that the experimenters are disreputable con artists, and subsequently the less you will believe the subject is psychic.<p>This is actually Jaynes&#x27; solution to a huge problem with Bayesian reasoning as a form of human reasoning: &quot;If more data should override a bad prior, then why in the &#x27;age of information&#x27; does nobody argee on anything!&quot; This example shows, according to Jaynes, that while we can certainly have irrational priors we can still explain human reason in Bayesian terms and still get a situation where two people faced with plentiful information will arrive at contradictory conclusions.",1453623847

Most of the time you rarely need it since you&#x27;re likely going to end up doing an MCMC or some other sampling method for the posterior, in which case you only need proportionality.<p>Right, and when doing Bayesian model selection the evidence drops out of the problem completely. All you need are the priors and the likelihoods.<p>The claim that ~H is &quot;not itself a valid hypothesis&quot; is dubious. If H is the hypothesis that a certain continuous parameter has a value in the range [a, b], then it&#x27;s perfectly obvious what ~H means.<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible to choose a vague, overly broad hypothesis, but a frequentist analysis of such a hypothesis is going to be just as bad as a Bayesian analysis. &quot;Garbage in, garbage out&quot; is true no matter what tool you use.",1453623444

Last year was year four.  The last time that happened was 1976-1977.  Agricultural water customers have had huge cutbacks in their water deliveries.<p>Right now, rainfall is more important than reservoir level changes. It takes time for the water to reach the reservoirs.  Rainfall so far this year is slightly above average, after four years of below average. This is not enough to recharge the reservoirs; that will take about two wet years.  It&#x27;s also not that important how much is in which reservoir; most of them are connected.<p>Here&#x27;s the drought contingency plan updated to February 13, 2016.[1]<p>Household water isn&#x27;t a big problem.

San Jose has that capability with a new plant, but isn&#x27;t using it for drinking water yet. (But if you take the tour there[2] you can drink some.)

10961916,comment,10956199,10960171,0,0,mercer,,,"This reminds me of the last chapter in &quot;The Autistic Brain&quot; by Temple Grandin. She spends a chapter or so describing three different &#x27;types&#x27; of people when it comes to way in which they think. Part of the reason she does this is to argue that we should stop (primarily) thinking about &#x27;autism&#x27; as a label/deficiency and instead look at the specific strengths and weaknesses of such a mind, and the variations even within autism.<p>But she also argues that this might be a good way of looking at things in general:<p>> “Reading an interview with Steve Jobs, I came across this quote: “The thing I love about Pixar is that it’s exactly like the LaserWriter.” What? The most successful animation studio in recent memory is “exactly like” a piece of technology from 1985?<p>> He explained that when he saw the first page come out of Apple’s LaserWriter—the first laser printer ever—he thought, There’s awesome amounts of technology in this box. He knew what all the technology was, and he knew all the work that went into creating it, and he knew how innovative it was. But he also knew that the public wasn’t going to care about what was inside the box. Only the product was going to matter—the beautiful fonts that he made sure were part of the Apple aesthetic. This was the lesson he applied to Pixar: You can use all sorts of new computer software to create a new kind of animation, but the public isn’t going to care about anything except what’s on the screen.”<p>> “He was right—obviously. While he didn’t use the terms picture thinker and pattern thinker, that’s what he was talking about. In that moment in 1985, he realized that you needed pattern thinkers to engineer the miracles inside the box and picture thinkers to make what comes out of the box beautiful.”<p>> “This is where the three ways of thinking—picture, pattern, and word-fact—come in handy.”<p>> “What all these examples tell me is that in society, the three kinds of minds naturally complement one another. Society puts them together without anybody thinking about it. But what if we did think about it? What if we recognized these categories consciously and tried to make the various pairings work to our advantage?”<p>While I believe the term &#x27;beautiful&#x27; doesn&#x27;t quite capture what design entails, I do think that the problem you describe might very well have to do with an overabundance of one &#x27;type&#x27; of thinking (however in-progress our understanding of these types might be).",1453623329

I would instead posit that most people can&#x27;t even make an informed decision on the matter because they&#x27;re too scared of computers/programming.<p>My experience is anecdotal from providing computer support and education over ~10 years, so obviously this should be taken with a grain of salt. But across all age groups and diverse backgrounds, those who aren&#x27;t into computers seem to be intimidated by them. In trying to teach even the basics of the command line to the technicians I was training, often the biggest factor as to how fast they learned was &quot;are they intimidated by computers?&quot;, and even those who fit the stereotype of PC gamer nerds would still freeze up a bit when going through the basics of command line like learning about cd and ls.<p>It&#x27;s true that quite a few people probably aren&#x27;t inclined towards programming - the skills and mindset a good programmer has are fairly unique, much like a good composer or a good artist. It&#x27;s a very delicate mixture of creativity, technical skill, logical reasoning, knowledge, and of course determination. (This list describes all of the above professions, imo) The issue is whereas it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable for kids and adults to pick up an instrument or dabble in painting from time to time as a hobby, hobbyist programming just really isn&#x27;t as readily taken up.<p>It&#x27;s why I scoff at articles that call the current generations of kids &quot;tech savvy&quot;, since they&#x27;re anything but. Most are still appliance users, and many can&#x27;t even do everything the appliance advertises. I don&#x27;t fault anyone but education systems that don&#x27;t have strong support and exposure to programming and computers at young ages. It&#x27;s the same reason that second language acquisition is so poor in the US, merely because people just aren&#x27;t being exposed to it at an age when they don&#x27;t have social inhibitions kicking in. The focus of the programs doesn&#x27;t have to be to produce an army of super programmers, just a class of children that are familiar with the subject matter, as they might be able to recall some fact about ancient egypt or about agriculture.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have a completely code-savvy populous for a long time; but it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to have hobbyist programmers become much more common.",1453622683

Eventually, I realised that having an accurate, carefully-calibrated display was pointless if I was going to use f.lux.<p>I tentatively tried using melatonin tablets instead, and I&#x27;ve found it works really well for me. Set an alarm for about 30-40 minutes before you want to go to sleep, take the tablet (sublingually) when the alarm goes off, and you&#x27;ll notice you start feeling sleepy right about when you need to fall asleep.<p>Obviously, this kind of exogenous melatonin intake can only crudely approximate the curves for plasma melatonin levels resulting from endogenous production in the presence of zero artificial light, but using f.lux only removes one source of blue light. Sure, you might feel sleepy staring at your screen, but blue light inhibits melatonin synthesis so strongly you could turn on your bedroom light and have your melatonin production bottom out. IIRC, you can significantly attenuate melatonin production with light levels of ~100 lx, which is comparable to a really dim room. Good luck getting ready for bed in complete darkness.<p>You also need to titrate your dosage to find the right levels. For me, 0.2-0.5mg is all I need to achieve the necessary sleepiness to motivate me to get to sleep.

I used Facebook Pirate for three or four months because I was so delighted at how many variable phrases they introduced regarding every small item on the page. It was as thorough a translation as I've ever seen online. (As an unrelated aside, Facebook supports the Konami code, which makes it the most mainstream geek site on the planet, and their Konami code triggers something wholly unexpected and hilarious.)<p>I don't know Facebook's employee breakdown, but remember that Facebook offers multiple products, each of which is a fairly complex offering. I can see their Photo app being worthy of a large interesting team; ditto Events, Notes, Video, their link sharing, their search (and doing search for Facebook sounds much more interesting than doing search for Google, because you get to play with so many concrete variables), their public pages offering, their iPhone application, and who knows what else they're cooking up. They've also got a unique graphic style that I'm sure a handful of people work on, and there's the usual stuff of marketing and advertising that's fun no matter where it is.<p>It doesn't seem completely insane to me that working for Facebook might be <i>really</i> fun, even as a grunt. Unlike Google, which always sounds like working there is 90% backend, Facebook has a <i>lot</i> of stuff that's immediately noticed by its users. It's one of the few big companies that I'd actively like to work for after graduation.",1254517140

Losing the 10k won't put us on the street, but it takes a big bite out of our safety net. It wasn't worth the risk, especially with the economy tanking.<p>In retrospect, my comment was poorly phrased since I had myself in mind as the ""smart poor.""

- They forced us to increase to about 20 employees (within a few months). 
- We hired former ""big time"" CEO/Presidents/Vice Presidents as our EVP's to help us grow fast.
- We were basically working 12 - 16 hours a day. I slept many times at work during data migration (which took for ever) 
- We were taking more customers than we could handle which resulted in lawsuits because we could not deliver on time (even after postponement).<p>Finally (after 2 years) the board fired the founder, brought in a new CEO from ""big time"" company. 
Needless to say employee moral died and I and the original employees were forced to resign (I was personally already on my way out).

Everyone agrees that altruism is <i></i>better<i></i> than selfishness in moral sense. However one must be quite civilized and have high quality of life and standard of living to exercise altruism. Those whose individual demands are not met simply cannot afford altruism. A financial system aimed at rewarding those who think of others (<i>surprise!</i>) exists right now. Those who have extra money, time or other resources can invest them in those who are in need through loans, grants and scholarships. I'm sure any innovative ideas in this area would be accepted by the HN community and society in general. This proves that the current society/economy is open for a change toward a more altruism-encouraging system.<p>Western society and morality is based on the relative tolerance to innate human desires and wishes in contrast to other cultures. That's why it has created a financial system that made the countries that chose it developed.<p><i>""Males have a desire to procreate, but rape is forbidden. We have a desire to promote the success of those with our genes, but discrimination is forbidden.""</i><p>Morality restricts certain ways in which a human can fulfill their needs. However rape is not the only way to procreate and discrimination has very little to do with promoting the success of one's genes. Today's social and financial system is successful among other factors because it provides equal and legitimate ways to have sex or multiply for everyone.<p>We are at crossroads, we have opportunity to choose the way financial system would look like in the future and that's why it is especially important to understand why the current financial system is successful. It is, despite difficulties, which, for example led only to a 2% drop in US GDP growth rate in 2008 compared to 2005. The GDP is still increasing!

These disturbances are annoying, but their impact on lifestyle is minor.<p><i>""Imagine saying, ""You're so greedy!"" Now imagine saying, ""You're so giving!"" It's a totally different feeling. Imagine a society that promotes the giving over promoting the greedy.""</i><p>What does this have to do with the initial argument? Could you please point out where I disagreed with this?",1254515491

Athletic training techniques aren't patentable, yet people still manage to innovate and share knowledge there.  Recipes are only protected by trade secrets, yet people manage to innovate when it comes to food; people publish cookbooks, restaraunts come out with new dishes.  Fashion designs are only protected by copyright, and yet fashion moves at a lightning pace.  Mathematical and logical proofs aren't patentable, yet people still do mathematical research, and talk about it.  And keep in mind that software patents weren't even recognized until the 1980's, and weren't widely granted until the mid-90's.  The majority of the history of computing has advanced without patent protection.<p>I'm not sure why you'd think that software advancement would be hindered without patents, or that conversation would somehow die out.  Patents for software are notoriously useless to read, and only an infinitesimal part of any system is patented anyway, and then generally only as a landmine against future competitors or to enforce mutually-assured destruction.  The vast majority of an application's ""secret sauce"" is protected by trade secrets, not by patents, and copyright guards against the actual theft of resources.  I don't think that patents in the software world really do much to open up what would otherwise be a trade secret, with the possible exception of things like compression algorithms.

There are two key difficulties with such a system, and it would be interesting to learn how Facebook grapples with them:<p>1 - It's imperative that the criteria for ranking employees is well-aligned with company goals. At Microsoft for example, on most teams you are ranked mostly on what features you ship. That sounds great but it can lead to extreme feature bloat in products. It's hard to take a stand for simplicity and elegant design in a meeting when the other guy's job depends on shipping the feature, and your job depends on getting the other guy to agree to include <i>your</i> feature.<p>2 - AMZN and MSFT both merge each manager's ranked list of direct reports with the lists created by other managers who report to the same Director or Senior Manager.  This process can often be much more political than meritocratic, since other managers usually don't know much about an individual engineer's performance.

(For instance, I can double-full-screen terminals, and set the menu bar to auto-hide.)<p>If I'm <i>not</i> in pure full-screen mode, I actually find it distinctly un-Mac-like to force windows to use up every last pixel of space.  That's kind of the point...the Mac's document-centered focus, ability to hide apps, use Exposé, and yes, menu bar, make it far easier to have 12 completely unrelated things open and use them effectively (compared to Windows and the Linux window managers I know about, anyway).<p>One tidbit people might not notice, is that the OS lets windows ""stick"" to the top of the screen; this works both under the menu bar and under the top ""edge"" of your 2nd display.  So it's pretty easy to arrange windows anyway.",1254514081

They would also have to have partner banks or provide the loans themselves.<p>It would work like this:<p>Company owns 250 homes in your target city.  You get guaranteed for a mortgage with them in advance.  Then you select from their properties one that you like.  If the property does not fit your needs, you can transfer, after a year, to another one of the properties, with a small moving fee, to another home in the network.<p>Would take loads of money to accomplish but would be neat~!!!",1254513995

The lateral slide is actually not a big issue, the landing gear on most larger aircraft are steerable to allow for that (""crab landing"" I think it's called).<p>Another idea in the file right after that one was to put vacuum flasks into car engines to keep the fluids hot after the engine is turned off. In theory this would reduce emissions & engine wear by reducing the number of cold starts. Turns out the Prius has that already.<p>On the other hand a Boeing engineer came up with the idea of the little winglets you see on airliners now, Boeing passed on the idea so he took it outside and worked with a guy named Joe Clark. Their company (Aviation Partners) has done very well.<p>I think the takeaway is that as an outsider to one of these mature industries you may come up with new ideas but you're also at a significant disadvantage compared to insiders.",1254513987

You might never do it. And if you did, you might do it in as-ethical a way as possible.  But you still need to know how to blow things up.<p>Similarly with business.  You may never leverage that knowledge, but someone else might.  And you need to know how to protect yourself from that.",1254513820

Maybe he wanted the business guy to spend some money on more programmers or maybe the solution was more reliable infrastructure and it wasn't something the programmer could fix with more code.<p>Who knows.

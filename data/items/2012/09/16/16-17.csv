The recordings and the concert tickets are the only product offered by bands that we place value in; t-shirts hold some slight social value, but little personal value. Revenues from concert tickets go mostly to the venue operator, especially for smaller venues of 100-200 people that most bands play in, and the amount going to the band is hopefully enough to pay for the cost of touring, and probably not much more than that.<p>So that pretty much leaves recordings as the only valuable product that bands can hope to sustain themselves with. Merch and tour ticket sales are not going to cut it for most artists, so without sales of recordings in some form, they're going to need to work a regular job, and the music is relegated to a hobby.<p>Making good recordings costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time in a recording studio, so hobby bands have difficulty producing them. Recordings are valuable to us because they allow us to integrate music into our lives.

Right now, local incomes can support those levels (just barely) but that can change, and when it does, urban decay will set in. Urban decay starts at least a decade before prices start to drop, because people hoard real estate rather than selling it when the market softens.<p>The problem with real estate markets is that there's extreme demand inelasticity, which means that declining conditions (reduced effective supply) actually cause aggregate prices to go up, in the same way that a hurricane in the Gulf drives up gas prices even though it's not a good thing.<p>The idea that high rents come from ""desirability"" is hopelessly naive. Very rich people can live whereever they want, so the difference between a $50-million apartment vs. a $10-million one is driven by those factors: how old the building is, how many third-world despots and celebrities live there there, whether it has a view of The Park. For the rest of us, the rent we pay is dictated by scarcity conditions rooted in regulatory corruption and the slow reaction of new housing construction to economic forces (i.e. that 10 jobs can be created faster than 10 houses)-- not ""desirability"". Real estate agents want you to believe that the reason The Rent Is Too Damn High is that New York is such an awesome place to live, but economics don't bear them out. Supply-side disruptions and failures push up prices much more than actual value increases or income improvements.<p>Regarding high-paying jobs outside of those locations, they exist but there aren't as many as there should or could be. The near-impossibility of getting funding for a new technology business away from the coasts is a real problem. Venture capital is ugly and I'd really like to see us, as a society, come up with something better, but it's the only option for a lot of companies in the global marketplace.<p>As for universal healthcare, we would have had it in 1948 if the Dixiecrat racists (who were afraid that a universal plan would require them to desegregate the hospitals) hadn't threatened to destroy Truman by stonewalling everything he did.

The poster says ""FOSS projects like GNU..."" and that is off base if he was implying that GNU has anything to do with OSS.  You are right, no one should be talking about a GNU as a FOSS project due to their outright rejection of the OSS ideology.<p>But just so we're clear, it is possible to talk about FOSS itself (the software) in a meaningful way.  It's not like the term is oxymoronic or something, in fact, the two descriptions are nearly redundant when it comes to describing the rights you get as a user, which is what you should be concerned with as a user of the software.<p>Why shouldn't we apply this to projects as well?  I guess the questions I would ask to clarify the point are: 1) What do you call a project that would like to empower users with software freedom but would also like to embrace the development style of Open Source?  2) Given that there are so many projects out there that embrace exactly that combination, shouldn't we have a name for that?",1347812310

Green Day was on a indie label, Lookout! Records, before hitting it big with ""Dookie.""  When you bought their first two CDs/cassettes a small catalog of Lookout! Records' other albums fell out with a listing of bands I'd never heard of before.  None of these bands had websites so information was really limited. You'd have to buy fanzines or know other people in your town that listened to those bands.  If you were lucky maybe one of those bands came to your town and you got to see what they looked and talked like for the first time.  I can't even imagine what it was like to see Black Flag touring every town in America in the early 80s introducing thousands of kids to a new subculture and form of music.<p>My point is, maybe I'm jaded now but music was so much more interesting then when there was mystery and not everyone had an opinion about a band before their first mp3 came out.  I think the disposable quality of mp3s makes music less valuable too.<p>The internet also killed regionalism in music for the most part where a certain ""scene"" would have a certain sound as bands around an area being influenced by each other.  See [1].

Its easy, free, and well even help you out. But if you dont want to be compatible, then dont expect help from OHA members that are all working to support and build a unified Android ecosystem.<p>How ""open"" is something if you can't fork it and be left in peace to negotiate with the OEMs to ship it? Aliyun is already missing the Google Play Store and the official Google apps.<p>The ""don't expect help from OHA"" line is especially ironic given that Acer scheduled a press conference to announce making Aliyun phones before being strong armed by Google into canceling it.<p>Acer really had no choice, Android has 67% of the market and iOS has the other 30%. Losing early access to code and access to the Google Play store and Google apps will basically kill their handset business because the competition like Samsung, HTC, Sony, Motorola etc. will have those advantages.<p>They would basically have to quit the handset market outside China to make Aliyun phones for the Chinese market. Forking is a fundamental tenet and in many cases the lifeblood of open source. If you don't want that, put that in the license and do not call it ""open"" instead of artificial after-the-fact restrictions like this. If you make something open, people are going to eventually do something with it that you may not like.<p>What next, forbid retailers from selling Aliyun phones or threaten to pull all Android devices from them?<p>The only differences I see between this and Microsoft's OEM restrictions against other OSes in the 90s is that Android is not a monopoly(though it is effectively one for Acer), and that Android is open source(again, Acer doesn't really have much leverage to go on it's own with Android code).",1347812219

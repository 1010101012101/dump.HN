Assuming that they're using the same guides in recommending server configuration, there are some things that could be done better by a skilled admin. e.g., their LAMP server guide for Debian 6 doesn't include suexec or any variation of FastCGI, two must-haves for a public-facing web server IMO.",1369857583

So unfortunately the best I can do is describe the thing again, using different words. Sorry.<p>The posited malware can't initiate an automatic transaction, since an OTP from the bank dongle is needed. The dongle needs to be seeded with a specific part of the receiver's account number, so just any OTP generated by the dongle won't do. The account number has been passed out of band (generally on a paper invoice), so taking control of my browser doesn't give the attacker a way of fooling me into generating an OTP suitable for use with their account either.",1369857501

5788697,comment,5785984,5788142,3,0,ISL,,,"There are some rebuttals by Peter Bender (his abstract for the 2013 April APS meeting may point in useful directions). For the space-based experiment, barring concerns about the technique itself, the right question may be, ""Even if the atom interferometer might work, is it a better bet than the existing plans for LISA?""<p>I haven't studied the atom interferometer GW stuff in great detail, but the measurements look challenging from a feasibility and systematic perspective. Any one objection can be addressed, but there are a lot of them, making it challenging in the aggregate. Continued work on the ground in the atom interferometer field over longer baselines will explore both. If that work can show that it works as proposed, then pessimism will turn to optimism; experiment is the arbiter of truth.<p>As for the second point, regarding clocks, my initial response of ""no"" came from exactly your argument. I hesitated when considering a global array of clocks. For wavelengths comparable to the size of Earth and smaller, there's enough phase difference that perhaps a sufficiently precise clock, read out sufficiently fast, might pick off a signal.  Additionally, if there are signals in the micro-to-nanohertz regimes, it might appear as an unexplained fit residual to an overall model of the gravitational potential at any one clock. My GR-fu is insufficient to make reliable estimates of the sizes of these effects (I bet they're small!).",1369857463

1. Regular customers can schedule their appointments regularly and have ""VIP"" status that gets them FREE haircuts as they refer the barber new clients and take advantage of exclusive promotions, think 'daily deals"" the barber can push out to preferred clients.<p>2. There will be some push back for barbers who dont embrace technology and don't mind a simple list. However, for those who are more tech inclined and time conscious (ex. barbers on the go and barbers who joggle multiple jobs). Also, we hope ourt early adopters, young tech-savvy barbers right out of barber college (looking to build clientile) can influence that older group. I do AGREE the app has to be very simple or they wont use.<p>I do plan to expand to salons, massage therapists, and tattoo artists but network is mostly with barbers.

Right from the start the trustworthiness of that source is higher than average, arbitrary site.<p>I agree. That doesn't change my point: JavaScript or binary packages, if you're running crypto you need to be able to trust the source of your software.<p>> Running JavaScript is like downloading new software to your home directory on a regular basis and executing it; you don't need to compromise the software source for /usr/bin/ssh, you just need to compromise a less trustworthy bit of software and then make that bit modify the in-memory behavior of /usr/bin/ssh (because JavaScript doesn't have the kind of security the OS gives processes).<p>This analogy is strained. It only really applies if your site is vulnerable to XSS attacks. After that, JavaScript is generally far more restricted than your average userland code. JavaScript from one site can't modify javascript from another (well-constructed) site. Whereas you correctly point out that once you can execute arbitrary code with user level privileges, the game is usually up.<p>In particular, x session keylogging means you can grab a sudo password from a user once you can spy on their session, which any userland program can do. JavaScript from attack.com can't monitor keypresses on trustedbank.com unless it's explicitly included (which can happen by accident via XSS).<p>Look up the same origin policy to see the kind of constraints that are usually placed on JS code.",1369854886

Now they're not fighting challenges within their instruments, but they have to ensure that they <i>know</i> each clock's depth in Earth's gravitational potential. Atomic clocks are small and elegant things with a pristine heart. They're now irreducibly sensitive to a very messy world.<p>Earth tides (dirt, not water) are larger than centimeters. With further improved precision, they'll be sensitive to small changes in the locations of local gravitational sources, even big ones at long range. In our gravity lab in Seattle, we see the effects of annual variation in water table. All of these things must be properly characterized in order to compare two clocks that are not co-located.<p>These are good problems to have, and are inherent to measuring time at this precision, but they're very daunting.

Y'all can let me know if this is more accurate:<p>There's a whole row of elevators. Some slowly head upwards, some downwards, some don't move at all - however, elevators can change speed or direction at any time. More often than not the change is in the downwards direction. Some of the faster-moving upwards elevators have velvet ropes or guards blocking them. It's hard to tell, because you can't really see more than one or two elevators at a time, and the guards are inconsistent, but it seems that to get onto the upward-moving elevators it helps to be straight, white and male. But to get on the really fast moving upwards elevators it's more helpful to be rich, well-educated, socially polished, and connected.<p>Complicating the picture is the shit cannons. Patrolling the top of the elevators are grinning guys in suits holding super-soakers filled with raw sewage. They blast the climbers at random. A few climbers make it to the top from their own efforts, fortunately avoiding any shit. They believe their success was down to hard work - onlookers say that they merely got lucky. What they really mean is that they weren't <i>unlucky</i> enough to be blasted in the chest with enough shit to send them back down to the bottom. Some people get blasted with a weaker, endurable stream of shit - these people often say that shit sucks but that you just have to deal with it. If you thought that it was grossly unfair that some people had access to the super high speed escalators, keep in mind that these escalators also feature the most brutal and indiscriminate shit cannons. A lot of the shit guards intentionally target women, though a few intentionally leave women alone. Others have other prejudices. It's pretty arbitrary.<p>Sometimes an entire escalator collapses. Everyone falls to the bottom and has to start again. Except the guys at the top, they're safe.<p>It's generally agreed that in the past, many more escalators  moved upwards. With a few exceptions, a lot of escalators have collapsed or starting moving downwards in recent years. Still, everyone agrees that they're luckier than the guys born far away, who have to fight desperately just to get access to the least desirable escalators.",1369854228

Most open source projects have very ad-hoc project management. There is typically a big bucket of stuff that needs to be done, but very little direction on how to decide which things you can and should actually do. More experienced developers can go in and muddle around semi-blindly until they figure out a reasonable starting point, but that&#x27;s <i>really hard</i> for less experienced people to do. It really takes a mentor willing to do that triage - &quot;maybe this would be a good place for you to start&quot; - but few open source projects seem to be forward-looking enough to provide that level of mentorship.",1398286404

It is written by, and for, people who enjoy pure mathematics and numerical functions. That describes a lot of incoming CS students, but not all of them.<p>Almost all the examples in the first few chapters are things like estimating the values of convergent series, and a less mathematically-inclined student will spend more time puzzling over the problem definitions than over the concepts of recursion and encapsulation that the problems are trying to demonstrate.<p>I think the book would be much stronger with a broader diversity of examples, especially early on.

We were happy to answer. A few of the suggestions were broadly desired by the groups.<p>He took lots of notes, and a year or so later C# was announced. It included several of those features.

Also, keeping questions simple, clear, specific and brief - with no implicit assumptions or loaded phrases.<p>2) Good research controls as many variables as possible.  The more uncontrolled the variables are the less valid the data is - but this applies to all studies, not just self-reports.<p>3) Correlation ≠ causation is rarely forgotten in the actual research - the discussion sections of research in reputable journals are overly modest at best, noting the limitations and weaknesses of the study and typically making few claims for generalizability.  Mass media reports, however, tend to take more than a few liberties.<p>I agree any valid study of friendship has to be longitudinal - the issue becomes one of measurement.  You do not trust self-reports, yet how else could it be measured?  Hire a researcher to follow people around?  Ask them to carry an audio recorder with them every day for a few years?<p>The only practical alternative I can think of is to ask their close friends or relatives.  However, this may be unnecessary because research has already compared self and other reports on a sensitive issue (life satisfaction) and found a high correlation (1).<p>And finally - although unscientific, the high upcount of this article suggests that it hit a nerve and that many here are unsatisfied with the quality of their friendships.

Most self-reporting relies on having the same question asked in different ways and places to catch people whose inconsistent answers suggest they should be removed from the sample.<p>However, my objection is that I don&#x27;t believe language can be easily classified in terms of the response it&#x27;ll elicit. Obviously, one can (usually) correctly guess the response that&#x27;ll be received if one were to run up to a stranger and yell &quot;You&#x27;re a [swearword of choice here]&quot;, yet the fact that I&#x27;ve had to preface this with the modifier &#x27;usually&#x27; betrays my point; some people will get aggressive if you swear at them, some will laugh, some will respond in kind, and so on. My concern is that if we can&#x27;t even predict the effect of language in its most obvious state, we probably can&#x27;t predict its effect in subtler states.<p>This unpredictability of language leaves us in a tricky position when it comes to asking questions on a self-reporting study. In order to solve that one objection, we&#x27;d have to come up with a method of using language which manages to communicate its point, without causing that point to make people feel emotion. This is further complicated by the fact that people are complex beasts with internal and external factors playing in to how they behave, such that a question formed neutrally for one person would probably not be so neutral with others. This also makes avoiding &#x27;fear of reprisal&#x27; for one&#x27;s response to a question impossible, as we can only remove <i>external</i> reprisal. It would not be possible for us to, for instance, removal the internal upheaval of a conflicted homosexual admitting to a survey that they were gay.",1398283448

Intel is already losing <i>billions</i> subsidizing Atom chips [1], their &quot;real&quot; competitors to ARM chips, to make them at least semi-attractive to OEMs (which will really get the short end of the stick, if they go with Intel anyway, because if they do help Intel succeed, Intel is going to immediately increase prices on them, to turn the division profitable again).<p>ARM chips don&#x27;t have to &quot;beat&quot; Intel. They just have to become good enough for desktop performance, while costing much less.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/intel-lose-1bn-quarter-mobile-year-2014-04/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/business/intel-lose-1b...</a>",1398283292

It&#x27;s a really weird typo especially when you consider the link points to the right site and it can&#x27;t be a spelling correction as both pidgin and pigeon are words but pidgeon is not [1]. It&#x27;s also weird that a news outlet such as wired would make such a mistake.<p>[1] Though you might say it&#x27;s a meta-pidgin borne out of the hybridization of pidgin and pigeon.",1398283255

This sounds like the author was simply comparing 10% for the aquihire vs. 30% agency fee. What should be compared is the % of total cash comp the team would receive as the fee. This goes back to the difference of funding a company vs. just presenting candidates.<p>Given the info of seven engineers:<p>- if each engineer is paid out 150k (fairly high end of market cash rate, not including stocks).<p>- then a 30% fee would be based on $1,050,000.<p>- in this scenario, any investor putting in more than $1,050,000 would receive less than the 30% agency fee.

Any outdoors activities which involve staying outside past curfew time will have to be issued a permit from the police, and only people passing special extensive anti-homelessness training would be allowed to possess such permits. \nPlaces where homeless people could find shelter would be destroyed by the police or rendered uninhabitable at huge expense and use of toxic and lethal material (inevitable deaths following that would be dismissed as acceptable collateral damage).

I was glancing over Moseley and Marks&#x27; paper (I read it a while ago, but not too carefully) and, now that I think about it, the mantra about writing simple programs is held in highest esteem by communities that traditionally had to struggle with their tools (Unix, because 1970s, and more recently the web folks, because they were building complex web applications long before JavaScript had anything that would even resemble a reasonable debugger). Much of this was done so as to eschew the limitations of the platforms themselves. PDP-11/20 had 64 KB of addressable RAM; the fact that you could write and compile programs on it alone was remarkable. Letting the computer take some of the thinking load was quite certainly impossible.<p>I&#x27;m still debating with myself whether allowing the computer to do some of the thinking for me would be good for the quality of my programs.

7762437,comment,7761486,7761486,2,0,cabinpark,,,"I guess, but at an HPC conference I went to last year there was a big session on Hadoop and introducing it to the researchers as a potential alternative for certain tasks. I also believe that technologies take a lot longer to penetrate academia then industry given the nature of academics so I don&#x27;t doubt Hadoop&#x27;s slow acceptance into the HPC community. Look at GPUs for example. They&#x27;ve been around for a while but it&#x27;s really only been in the last few years that the tool has been put into the toolkits of researchers.<p>I do know one professor math professor who just a few hundred thousand on a Hadoop cluster to experiment with numerical algorithms. Talking with him, and I trust his opinion since he does research specifically in high performance linear algebra, was that he thought the technology was very appealing and can be an excellent addition to the repertoire. However there is still much work to be done since numerical linear algebra (which is the backbone of almost every single HPC calculation) using the Hadoop framework is very young. I believe it&#x27;ll take a few years for researchers to determine whether or not Hadoop could be a useful tool for solving the types of problems academics do or whether it&#x27;s just not as effective as the current tools.",1400397325

The ones who chose the right course will be okay either way, but the ones who chose the wrong course won&#x27;t get to find out until it&#x27;s too late to switch, at least not without having wasted a nontrivial chunk of their lives.

Communicating the &quot;why specifically&quot; is what distinguishes you from the &quot;don&#x27;t get it&quot; types and is less hostile than implying that he couldn&#x27;t possibly understand the why.<p>I&#x27;ve been in many situations (though more about philosophical ideas than business ones) where someone would repeatedly insist that something I was proposing was wrong, and only by extensive research did I find out that the whole time they could have just said X, and it would have made sense.

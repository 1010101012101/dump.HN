Again, its about what I think people will like within the community that I've read.<p>I've been on HN for over 3 years and I'll bet the majority of my posts come from NYTimes where I worked for a large part of that time. Again - it was always open in my browser so hard not to be hyper-aware of what was being posted and catch interesting stuff.<p>I'm just doing my best to be as upfront as possible. Plenty of others don't necessarily do that:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=nickbilton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=nickbilton</a><p>Sometimes I post two links in a day, sometimes it will be one link in a week or two. Again, its as I see things I like and want to share.<p>Updated my profile to say: ""I do post stuff from qz.com on occasions that I post cos I naturally come across it as part of my work"" and linked to your Comment since it provides more detail.<p>Not sure this is the answer you wanted but I certainly hope that helps clarify things a bit.",1352138373

Most of the web runs on Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Ruby/Perl, all of which run fine on ARM. I'd say that's a sizable server market that would already be happy on an ARM server. I would be. We run nothing on our servers that doesn't already compile on ARM.<p>Then again, we've just switched to an entirely virtualized infrastructure running under KVM a few months ago, and ARM doesn't really have much in the way of hypervisor support.

Look at $18K (base = $50K) If $18K is 15% or less of your revenue goal then find a way to make it to $50K. What also happens when you're paying $50K vs $32K is you'll attract a significantly upgraded candidate which in turn will increase your chances of hitting or exceeding your overall revenue goals.

There is nothing to support the notion that playing with prey reduces injuries to the predator.<p>>It keeps the cat's jaw (which is the part that delivers the killing bite, and which is the part that does the eating) away from the beak and teeth and claws, while the paws do batting and patting.<p>Paws are able to be bitten, scratched and infected just as easily as faces.  The consequences of paw and leg injuries are in fact <i>more</i> dangerous than injuries to the face.  It is hard to hunt when you can't run.  There is no benefit to prolonging the exposure to danger by keeping the prey alive.<p>>It increases the chance of getting a kill, which is what gives the cat food after the hunt<p>A quick bite to the neck is the best chance of killing.  Letting the prey struggle and escape to be re-caught is lowering the chances of getting food, not raising it.  You are claiming the opposite of reality.<p>>That does not explain why feral cats, cats that need to hunt to survive, play with prey.<p>Yes it does.  They only do so when they are teaching young to hunt.  They do not play with their prey when they are engaged in the process of ""acquire food to prevent death"".<p>>Hunting a laser pointer is chasing prey, it is not playing with prey.<p>It is engaging in instinctive hunting behaviour for no benefit.

Presented with evidence that Feynman's IQ was not exceptional, you conclude that he was not a genius.  Presented with evidence that he was a genius, you conclude that there must be an external reason that he did not do better on the IQ test, and the test result can be thrown out.<p>The conclusion that you seem to think impossible is that someone can clearly be a genius and yet that genius would not be reflected on IQ tests.<p>Let me offer you two alternate hypotheses.<p>The first fits the criticism in the above post.  Many questions on IQ tests are ambiguous - there are multiple logically possible answers, and to find the ""right"" one you have to figure out what line of reasoning the test maker was most likely to have followed.  This is a question about conventions, and Feynman clearly was extremely unconventional.  He therefore is an example of someone who was literally too creative to do well on the test.<p>A second possibility is that Feynman's gifts were overwhelmingly mathematical, not verbal.  His graduate entrance exams stand as evidence of this, as do comments from people who have examined his work.  See <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstein/201112/polymath-physicist-richard-feynmans-low-iq-and-finding-another"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstei...</a> for an example.  Since an IQ test has a large verbal component, on which Feynman would have only been somewhat above average, he did not score exceptionally well.<p>I like the first theory better, but there is significantly more evidence for the second.  But either way there is no evidence from anyone who knew him, including Feynman, that the IQ score he got is not what he should have been expected to get based on what an IQ test measures.",1352136725

Something may be news precisely because there is conflict, and exponentially so if that conflict affects a news organizations' readers via proximity or other news values. Where no conflict can be found, it can be (and often is) generated via balance. Science writing is full of it, same with education writing and politics. Find one source that says one thing, another source that says the opposite and you've generated built-in conflict. If the conflict is sensational enough, your editor puts it on the front page.<p>This is a real problem in journalism. Journalists are specifically trained as generalists. There's a culture of avoiding becoming experts in their beats, instead they strive for access to experts. The argument is that by not being an expert, one can write for a general audience more clearly. Just follow the formula.<p>Anyway, news is narrative. That is the chosen format. Compelling narratives do better at selling news than dry factual reporting.<p>There's a reason why, for example, when newspapers do polls that are outliers from the consensus they blare that information as loudly as possible.

4744649,comment,4743154,4743154,1,0,tokenadult,,,"Let me comment on some of those points after reading through the blog post kindly submitted here.<p>""Issue #1: Teach Programming at an Early Age<p>. . . .<p>""Ask any programmer how old they were when they first started coding.  A survey done on that very question shows that programmers who were still coding well into their thirties started learning, on average, at age 13 with a standard deviation of about 5 years, which is a window from age 8 to 18.""<p>More interesting than asking current programmers at what age they started programming would be asking them whether they first learned to enjoy programming and to become good at it because of school lessons, or despite school lessons. Comments on that issue from working programmers would be very interesting to me here.<p>""Therefore, I believe we need to require all Middle School students to take a course that equips them with a basic understanding of computers and computer programs.""<p>I took a unit in BASIC programming on a time-sharing terminal as part of my eighth grade mathematics class during the Baby Boom generation. That didn't turn me into a programmer. Some of my high school classmates who did turn into programmers endured our high school's optional course on computers (as I also did), but they actually learned their programming by doing what they felt like on the PLATO time-sharing terminal at our public library, by playing around with their early Hewlett Packard electronic calculators, and as they became college students by building their own microcomputers before those were a commercially available product. My oldest son, who is currently a software engineer at a startup in New York City (yeah, they have their electricity back now) learned to program in a joint class arranged by our homeschooling support group, with voluntary attendance, through some voluntary distance-learning courses, and through a lot of building his own projects on GitHub while taking computer science classes through dual enrollment at our state flagship university while of high school age.<p>""An early start program like this would ensure that everyone gets a taste of what it's like to code, giving us a greater opportunity to inspire more kids to become developers.""<p>Mandatory school courses in MANY subjects frequently have little or nothing to do with what actual practitioners do with the same subject in the free-enterprise workplace. It would be an interesting issue to study empirically, but for all the evidence I have seen, mandatory school courses can do as much to turn pupils off to subjects as they do to spark learner interest.<p>""Issue #6: Refactoring Congress and Agencies<p>""If Congress were a software product, customers would have abandoned it long ago. If I am elected president, I intend to bring a set of fresh eyes to every little process in congress, the executive branch, and our many government agencies.""<p>Translated into English, what he is saying is that he is going to violate the separation of powers among three branches of federal government that is built into the United States Constitution. And Congress will succeed in blocking him from doing that--with my full support. I don't want a dictator in the United States, and I'm more worried about a President who becomes a dictator with no checks and balances than I am about an inefficient Congress. (Indeed, I cherish the saying of a wise friend of mine who said, in a conversation about politics with a mathematics teacher and me, ""I'm an engineer. The last thing I want is EFFICIENT government."") On the other hand, to give this point its due, if he would like to do more private-sector contracting to deliver services of the executive branch that the President leads, I'm happy to see him do competitive contracting to the full extent allowed by law, and to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to persuade Congress to pass more laws that would allow more flexibility in management of executive branch agencies.<p>""Issue #8: Space<p>""Developers care about space. Maybe it has something to do with an appreciation for inspiring innovation in the fields of engineering,""<p>but more likely it has more to do with most developers reading more science fiction novels than they read books about history and current events. I'm a child of the Space Age, and I liked nothing better in my youth than watching TV news reports about space missions and reading continually books (fiction and nonfiction) about all aspects of space exploration. But the cruel expense of boosting materials out of earth's gravity well even into near-earth orbit has convinced me, once I grew up and learned economics, that manned space exploration (particularly) is a huge waste of money, and even unmanned space exploration (which I support in general, for instance by putting photographs of Mars on my computer as my desktop wallpaper) needs to be very carefully managed not to become a money pit. I agree with Neil deGrasse Tyson that there is a rapturous sense of wonder derived from exploring space that expands our imaginations, and that basic science research in general is very important, but it is easy to spend too much on the space program, which was certainly done by the space shuttle program and arguably by the Apollo program. There are a lot of exciting and stimulating basic science problems to solve right here on earth.<p>As Winston Churchill said, ""Many forms of Government have been tried and will be tried in this world of sin and woe.

Even at $2-3 margins you're going to need tens of thousands of domains to cover costs. You want the best support, but are a 1 man operation, to hire a 24/7 team, you would need 3 people working full shifts (if that includes you), we're talking at least 50,000-70,000 domains (not even sure what costs you have, so that would be on top).

The current complex distribution and supply network doesn't have to pay taxes because they are already illegal, so they'll continue to charge the current price.<p>Under the current scheme, the street price of drugs represents price + cost of maintaining a standing army + maintenance of baroque, multi-tier, low-capacity, high-overhead supply chain + ""hazard pay"" level wages for everyone involved in the enterprise.<p>So just focusing on taxes gives an unrealistic view of the situation.  No, they're not paying taxes, but they're paying for scads and scads of other things, and have to pass that cost on to the consumer.  This is pure deadweight loss, just as taxes would be.  But it's also a relatively enormous loss; it would be very easy to come up with a tax rate that fits in below it.  I suspect that anything less than four digits should do the trick, which means that we could even set the rate many times higher than the current rate for cigarettes and be fine.<p>And the market will not support operating an illegal network that's more expensive than the costs imposed by taxation.  Take tobacco: organized crime is absolutely still involved in tobacco smuggling.  And with excise taxes on cigarettes in the US averaging over 100%, that shouldn't be surprising.  But at the same time, it doesn't seem to be supporting organized crime and associated social costs on anything near the scale we've seen with groups like the Zetas or al-Qaeda.",1352135660

At Automattic we've also had a peek behind the curtain of pretty much every high-scale WP installation out there.<p>The vast majority of performance issues I've seen are not from something intrinsic to PHP or MySQL, but how people configure them. (MySQL is especially confounding.)  There have been ports to other DBs but nothing that matches the performance of regular WP with a single layer of caching, like Batcache or Supercache.<p>For dynamic pageviews, ck2 is correct, our biggest barrier is just the amount of code we're parsing and executing on every pageload, which a different DB backend would not change. This problem is bigger on WP.com. I think we can fix this by becoming more conservative and clever about what we load for a given page and it's something I expect to be addressed bit by bit over the next few releases.

The only major disagreement is about QE, not the size or character of fiscal stimulus.<p>I think you should pay attention to both Stiglitz and Krugman because they are very insightful 'hackers' in Economics in every good sense of the word.<p>Both are theorists, that try to explain real world phenomena with simple, often in their own words 'silly' models. Both don't shy away from math and are mindful of the empiric research being done by others, without sacrificing substance.<p>The results of their work are that we are able to explain very accurately anomalies in international trade and errors in traditional welfare analysis (Krugman's increasing returns models of agglomerations and Stiglitz's externalities, respectively). They should really be given Nobels at least two times - they are definitely not one-hit wonders and Krugman's work on exchange rate volatility, currency crises and liquidity traps are extremely relevant today.<p>Both are very outspoken in their criticism of the powerful of the day and the orthodoxies of 'think-tank economists' and thus often dismissed by them as 'leftists'.<p>Even if you don't agree with them you should watch their talks and columns. 
To see the hacker ethic in Krugman's work check out this piece: 
<a href=""http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/howiwork.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/howiwork.html</a><p>Specifically about government spending and the article:<p>* Stiglitz and Krugman both assert in the talk that they prefer the spending to be on infrastructure and education. So the article is being very dishonest. Even in the infamous ""Space Aliens invasion"" remark Krugman recommended building ""things like high-speed rail""<p>* Actually the US has austerity in the state and municipal level, so there isn't actually ""additional dollars of federal spending"". Also mentioned in the talk, and many other places by these two.<p>* There is wide agreement about positive multipliers in the crisis since around 2011. The proposition that they may have been negative has been shot down by studies in 2010 and has very little basis in theory. Economists like Alesina who were austerity hawks before that have back-pedalled somewhat and the IMF has admitted that austerity deepens recessions.<p>* Krugman and the Romers have written quite a lot why this depression is very much like the one in the thirties.",1352135146

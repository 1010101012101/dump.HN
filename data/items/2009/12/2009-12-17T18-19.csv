But it's worth pointing out that writing a unit test, which is the subject that started this discussion, is definitely not a time when you're ""fully considering potential failure scenarios"".  Unit tests are narrow and focused, and aimed at verifying features.<p>What you're talking about is something I'd call white box QA.  Which is valuable, though it's essentially just an extension of design, and has the same limits.<p>My broad point still stands: you can't ""process"" your way out of this with extra testing.  Some bugs are just inherent, and stem from the fact that we're human.",1261076297

1001584,comment,1001263,1001263,0,0,gyardley,,,"I don't believe the market will balance itself at all.  Online publishers are reliant on advertiser revenue, and there's far too much ad space to fill solely with useful ads for useful products.  At the same time, the vast majority of AdBlock users block almost everything - including the 'useful ads for useful products' and the high-value branded advertisements that pay by the impression and really don't care whether you click on them or not, just as long as you <i>see</i> them.<p>Right now, online publishers view ad blocking as an annoying evil not worth combatting - under the assumption that <5% of all users block advertisements, that the users that do often aren't advertisers' most desirable demographic, and that playing cat-and-mouse with ad blockers is more annoying than it's worth.  But as the percentage of users using ad blockers rises, more online publishers will be open to technical solutions to this problem.  I know of multiple projects that incorporate server-to-server ad calls (so the ads are served from the same domain as the content) and slicing of ads into multiple smaller images (so the ads aren't standard IAB image sizes, but chunks of the key content are.)  Other projects I've seen tie the presence of advertising to key site functionality, making it impossible to use the site effectively without referencing a visible advertisement.  As ad blocking increases to the point where it's material to publishers, blocking ad blocking will spawn a lot of startups.<p>There's already a good example of this: the increasing use of Local Shared Objects (also known as 'Flash cookies') to store data formerly stored in cookies and even to respawn data in deleted cookies.  Use of Local Shared Objects for advertising purposes was extremely rare several years ago. As the proportion of users regularly deleting the cookies that contained unique IDs for ad targeting and frequency capping crept up, the market didn't 'balance' by forgoing unique identifiers in cookies - it found a technical workaround by repurposing rarely-deleted LSOs.<p>I never really understand it when ad-blocking advocates evangelize to the general public - the more there are, the more likely it is that their blocking will in turn be blocked.",1261075238

I did find one reference -<p>""D. E. Stevenson attributes this story to Nancy Leveson, <i>Software System Safety,</i> STAR '93, Ontario at Darlington, Ontario. 1993.<p>A torpedo was designed to self-destruct if it turned 180 degrees. Unfortunately for the test ship the torpedo stuck in the tube and the captain turned the ship around for port ""<p>It sounds mildly more plausible since it doesn't begin with the rather improbable torpedo design problem of 'submarines shooting themselves with their own torpedo'.<p>Still, if tasked with designing a reasonably safe torpedo, one of the very first things you're likely to come up with are 'armed' and 'safe' modes with the torpedo staying in 'safe' mode until it is about to be launched. The next obvious safety feature would be to make the torpedo return to 'safe' mode the moment significantly abnormal conditions are encountered - say, stuck in tube, wildly off-course, etc.<p>Adding a self destruct mechanism seems highly unsafe - there's the problem of the self-destruct mechanism malfunctioning and activating at an inopportune time. Additionally, if the torpedo has no idea where it is, the last thing you probably want is having it blow up - possibly near you or a friendly.<p>The actual stories of the difficulties developing WWII torpedoes are quite interesting and offer plenty of lessons in complex systems design, testing and deployment - see:<p><a href=""http://www.ww2pacific.com/torpedo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ww2pacific.com/torpedo.html</a><p>A design flaw that must have been particularly galling: ""The conventional contact exploder was designed for the earlier, slower, 33 knot, Mk 13 torpedo. The newer, faster, 46 knot, Mk 14 torpedo had higher inertial impacts that would cause the firing pin to miss the exploder cap. "" In other words, the more squarely you hit your target, the more likely the torpedo would fail.",1261075120

He knew and understood the medium despite having started as a print designer.  As he did with print, where he learned about the pre-press process, he made sure he learned about the web, usability and understood HTML and CSS.  What a joy it was to work with him.  His designs were beautiful and understood usability without sacrificing appearance.  He's gone on to do independant work and now makes double what I do.  Good on him.<p>Then there's the other side.  I've worked with another designer who thinks design exists in a silo, refuses to learn anything about the medium and has very firm (and misguided) ideas about usability.  They see no point in involving a programmer in the design phase because the programmer is just supposed to make things work and doesn't understand design.  They have learned nothing about the web and feel learning HTML or CSS dilutes their focus; any designer that does know these things is looked down upon because they're spreading the attention to far and will make a poor designer.<p>Programmers can make it hard on a designer, even good ones, and we shouldn't.  This is the most valuable working relationship you can form in my opinion.<p>If you find one of the former, hold on to them like they are the only life preserver in the ocean.

The bikes we've recovered (I run <a href=""http://www.londonfgss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.londonfgss.com/</a> ) have turned up as far afield as the coast and as close as Brick Lane.<p>Down Brick Lane market on a Sunday morning there is literally a fence... a chicken wire one from which stolen bikes are sold. Lord knows what the buyers are thinking, and the police are well aware of what is happening too (but are doing very little about it).<p>We are now tracking (within the community) where bikes are stolen from, the measures used to protect them and evidence of how they were circumvented as well as where and when the bikes are turning up. With a large enough community (over 12,000 users in the same city) we're able to recover a fair amount of our own property after the event... not to say we're lax about protecting it but that by taking as many precautions and steps that you can you stand some chance of being re-united should the worst happen.<p>Opportunist crime wherein someone just steals something because it's easy to and then they keep the item now seems rare.<p>Oh, and if you're interested in bike security these guides on my site are good places to start:<p>Guide to which locks to use (which are primary security, which should be considered secondary):

We're collectively writing guides on bike security too which we hope will be released under creative commons on a wiki and then from there we can encourage bike shops to distribute copies with every new bike sold.<p>Anyhow... I am more than wandering off the point, which is that most stolen bikes in London are stolen to be sold and that the buyers tend to be regular people who do take them into bike shops after a while, from where some bikes have been recovered. More successfully though, we've recovered bikes from Gumtree and eBay classifieds.",1261074083

Perq is my startup's application for small business and HR folks to track and manage employee Paid Time Off (PTO).<p>Our Business Plan:
First, through our research and personal experience, we have learned that small companies are often overlooked when it comes to business software. Employee benefits management, like PTO, is often bundled into large, expense payroll services from ADP and the like. For us who do not want to sink our fledgling capital into overpriced payroll services, there is a need for HR tools.<p>Second, by tracking PTO, saving one day of employee's time by preventing vacation 'overages' recoups the cost of our software instantly. Companies can save thousands of dollars by making sure employees comply with their company policies.<p>Our Goal:
To save business owners money, by giving them control over attendance policies and paid time off.<p>Our Invitation:
If you are a small business owner or manage groups of people, we may be a great tool for you. We invite you to check our Perq, and save with the discount code.<p>If you do not fall into the group above, take a look anyway, and any feedback on our application is welcomed. We are looking for ways to improve our product and our offer.<p>Happy Holidays,

Why make a more complicated game of it than that?  The only things to really guard against are take-overs of a silo (capturers should have no clue what wires to cross) and not-yet-fully-trusted missileers.  Meanwhile, the failure modes of control and command have to fail gracefully and, in this case, that means putting the bombs fully under the control of a few trusted guys who are relied upon to exercise good judgment.<p>I'd bet those things could be launched in less than a minute, more or less by flipping a disguised switch.

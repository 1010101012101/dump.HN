The additional pixel density can be exploited to provide ""pixels"" which have more subtle variations in color. In color printing the printer is capable of some number of dots per inch, but there is another number (sometimes called the 'screen resolution' as a kick back to the silkscreen printing process) where the color gamut peaks (the maximum number of different colors the printer can print). Generally screen gamut in 'sub-retina' displays is fixed by the ability of the electronics to modulate the component colors, but with additional pixels you can 'squeeze out' more colors by using a group of four, or nine, pixels that are colored to simulate a single pixel.<p>Not a huge deal yet, but no doubt it will become one with '4x' and '8x' oversampled displays.",1351283904

Don't remember 2000 well, or rather it's overshadowed by other memories of that election.  Anyway, I may be wrong of course but my point is I'm not surprised at seeing an announcement like this during election season.

Other scales are dB SPL ( ""sound pressure level""), which is what you where probably referring to.<p>So in other words, you are probably saying that reducing the signal loudness is reducing your signal-to-noise ratio and thus your audible dynamic range. However, your noise floor is probably far higher than 0 dB, more like 20-30 dB SPL (if you're lucky!). A normally-loud (that is, non-damaging) music playback will probably be at about 50-80 dB, so your usable dynamic range will be about 30-60 dB, which translates to about ten bits. Most environments will be worse.<p>0 dB are actually pretty hard to come by. Even well-insulated acoustical measurement chambers only go to about 10 dB.

Nothing new.<p>If people want to base the vote over advert based timespans then they will, though I always found it better to look at what they have done outside that PR window and not on the PR spun, vote for us ones.  In the UK last election I saw the concervatives saying they were about local jobs in a leaflet from my local candidate.  Said leaflet was printed in another county and with over 5 local printing companies I did see thru the PR spin on that one.<p>Personaly if you vote based on what your told by the salesman only then you are opening yourself up to mistakes.

For example, raw data is usually level 0, and basic processed data is level 1 Processed and calibrated data is usually level 2, etc... but experiments often have different definitions for each level.  Reprocessing of any later can happen at any time, although level 1 reprocessing is usually an extremely intensive operation because it operates with the largest amount of data.<p>Level 0 data is usually heavily compressed when it's left on disk, because it's typically the largest amount of data, but also least touched.<p>Most scientists will use level 2 or level 1 data.

Analogue dynamic range is only limited by the noise floor of the cable and the resolution of the DACs/ADCs. The DACs/ADCs will probably do 24 bits.<p>Audio recordings typically do not go beyond 16 bits of dynamic range after mastering. And even before that, microphones can't deliver more than 20. Neither can ears. So that part of the system won't likely be a problem.<p>Reducing the signal gain in the analogue domain does not decrease its dynamic range, it merely shifts it to a lower range of the same width. Of course, this will only be true in the operating range of the op-amps, but that is typically not a limiting factor.<p>After the DACs, the signal will likely go through another pre-amp, then main amp in the sound system, then some analogue filters, then loudspeakers. All these are analogue and not usually limiting the dynamic range (though they will add some distortion). Finally, the signal will enter a room with noise aplenty, which <i>will</i> limit the effective dynamic range of the signal significantly.

You could say that as an investment wetware pays off. A different issue is if those are sustainable, but given that those have existed for thousands of millions of years across multiple species, we can say they are.<p>Human interactions have not been around for such a long time, but it can be argued that since human populations can survive (and have survived) for centuries within the restrictions of resources available to local ecosystems, those are potentially ""green"" too, though not necessarily to the scale we see in today's world. I will not try to discuss the benefits of human interaction or civilization, but I believe most of us will agree that it is so big that it will continue to exist for as long human beings have any amount of resources beyond the bare minimum for physical survival.<p>Computing is a tricky one though. I do not think that in its current form those are sustainable in the long term, regardless of the benefits that we may get from them. But it does not have to do so much with the per unit cost, but with the economies of scale and huge capital investment needed for semiconductor production to be cost effective. Even if operation cost keep dropping, the race to sustain the Moore's Law calls for even more expensive and environment unfriendly manufacturing processes to be relied on.<p>For me, this is the biggest flaw in the article. A call for manufacturing hoards of dissimilar purpose-specific chips would break the economies of scale needed to make the production of electronics viable (versus the energy consumption issue).<p>The qualifier here is that ""computing"" is an abstract capability, that in this day and age we happen to realize by the application of semiconductor technology. For the long term future, I hope that we will eventually move to a different, leaner and cleaner form of technology that will fulfill the same functions.",1351281735

I don't know how close you are to NESIT (hackerspace up near Waterbury) but I've heard some good things about it from friends; planning on heading up there and giving a little talk soon.  There's another hackerspace somewhere on the Eastern side of the state, but don't recall where.",1351281711

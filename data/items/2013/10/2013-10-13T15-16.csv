We can just be a little less &quot;wrong&quot; than the people before us ;)<p>No, I don&#x27;t deny the influence of genetics on intelligence and the like, however I don&#x27;t believe that it outweighs teaching.
(I had the experience when our math class was way advanced compared and our A-level was easy due to the teaching methods of a very talented and engaged math teacher ...). There are tons of other examples, if you give an average person with average IQ the breathing room and spark their interest they can become an expert in any field (that&#x27;s what I believe ...). They might not become a Goedel or Turing, yet that&#x27;s something else ...<p>Do you say that it&#x27;s in our genes if we understand a particular subject (e.g. algebra, differential equations ...)  or not?<p>If you don&#x27;t receive any formal training in anything or get the wrong teaching, sorry than genetics won&#x27;t help you. 
The type of training and teaching are more important than your genetics when it comes to contributions to the sciences (assuming no disabilities). I&#x27;ve seen this over and over ... at elementary school, high school and university.<p>There are studies that show that the IQ of a child for example is to 1/4 determined by their family environment and deteriorates rapidly with social risk factors. e.g.

I&#x27;ve been smacked down for a joke here or there, spent some time wondering about the same thing.<p>HN seems influenced partly by a frustration with other aggregators, forums. There&#x27;s an explicit desire to prevent the slide towards irrelevance.<p>Comedy and drama never compete on a level playing field, true of forums, or in any other arena. Probably because they just aren&#x27;t commensurable, and don&#x27;t belong on the same scale. You can&#x27;t really compare Airplane!, The Shining, or Before Sunset. They&#x27;re all just completely different experiences. If people take something very seriously, like the Oscars, they tend to ignore comic achievements. If people are quickly flipping through the internet out of boredom, it can swing the other way.<p>One of the best moderation systems for cultivating both at the same time is over at Slashdot, where you can mod something up as &quot;funny,&quot; &quot;insightful,&quot; or &quot;informative.&quot; Then readers can filter comments based on which of these they&#x27;d rather see. Everyone&#x27;s experience is customized, and the &quot;funny&quot; upvotes are just on a completely separate scale.<p>All moderation systems and interfaces involve tradeoffs though, and HN seems to pride itself on simplicity. The simple interface, combined with the desire to escape the trivial tone of Reddit, pushes to a more serious discussion, maybe one that takes itself a little too seriously. But that seems a fair balance against the rest of the Internet, which probably doesn&#x27;t take itself seriously at all.<p>That said, you can do humor on HN, you just have to know your audience. I wouldn&#x27;t use &quot;The Aristocrats&quot; with my family at dinner, on HN, I&#x27;d stick to incredibly dry long form satire reminiscent of Jonathan Swift.

You can accomplish an awful lot of business logic in a single SQL query, which makes SQL tremendously useful thing to know. On the other hand it is tedious to tweak an object mapper call to give you the result that you want that efficiently.<p>This is useful for abstracting away some routine SQL queries, but I think people think simple selects and inserts are more routine than they are actually are.. If you structure your data layer in a way that takes advantage of the power of the RDMBS I find that the only query here is truly routine is insertion on a single row...<p>We already have a language for expressing relational database queries - SQL.

Only an unfortunately small percentage of the population who have medical insurance who live in a rich 1st world country and are somewhat lucky have triumphed (temporarily) over microbes, the rest of the species dies like flies from dumb infections.  The rest of the list is innovation as defined by minor evolution or profitability or extreme rareness such that is irrelevant.  I think that is the wrong definition.<p>Innovation is a Dr hanging out with the physicists and next thing you know the peculiar optical behavior of ultra-short wavelength xrays passing thru flesh to see bones is applied to patient care.  Or resonating the nuclei of hydrogen atoms using unusual shaped magnetic fields to image the hydrogen density of living flesh is applied to patient care.  Or blasting a very narrow, moving beam of radiation carves out a 3-d shape of death, surrounded by living tissue, and hopefully that dead tissue was a tumor.  That&#x27;s innovation.<p>I would contrast that to, now we&#x27;ll do exactly the same thing we always did exactly the same way (although perhaps slightly faster or slightly more convenient or slightly cheaper) by looking at a pocket sized wireless graphics display instead of using a desktop sized wire connected graphics display.  Boring.  Maybe profitable, maybe highly profitable, but not innovative or interesting.  The world is full of highly profitable completely non-innovative companies, innovation is hardly a universal positive anyway.",1381676442

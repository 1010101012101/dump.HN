    - sin((x, dx)) = (sin(x), cos(x)).
</code></pre>
Note that the right element of the tuple can be computed precisely from quantities readily available from the inputs to the operator.<p>It&#x27;s also extensible to derivatives of scalars that are functions of many variables by a vector (of those variables) (common in machine learning).<p>It&#x27;s beautifully implemented in Google&#x27;s Ceres optimisation package:<p><a href=""https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver/+/1.8.0/include/ceres/jet.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver/+/1.8.0/i...</a>",1441058365

The hypothesis in the article is that it&#x27;s a psychological effect that can be exacerbated by brain injury. And the evidence outlined, such as experiments that can reliably produce equivalent effects, and similar brain lesions accompanying the most extreme examples provides some, although not overwhelming, evidence for the hypothesis.<p>If you&#x27;re suggesting that people&#x27;s perceptions and consciousness are actually physically separating from their body, well then that&#x27;s just another hypothesis. One that needs supporting evidence and a proposed mechanism before it can be taken seriously. That is how science works. Simply saying “this phenomenon is strange” doesn&#x27;t change anything. It doesn&#x27;t make it immune to scientific inquiry, and it doesn&#x27;t lower the standard of proof required of explanations. Science has successfully explained many phenomenon far weirder than OOB experiences.",1441058074

You still have the original problem: this thing is declared as a T, but sometimes it&#x27;s not a T, so you have to inspect how the value is used before you can conclude whether it&#x27;s a T or not.<p>The correct solution is to structure the language so access can&#x27;t occur before initialization. For example, you could place severe constraints on constructors so they must initialize all the fields and do nothing else until that&#x27;s done.

You basically return Either Value [Error], which has the benefit of being much more compassable than something that breaks control-flow like try/catch.<p>For example, if you have something like<p><pre><code>    x = emptyStringOnDoesntExist(read(path)) // &quot;&quot; on not exist error BUT NOT permission error
    x = emptyStringOnAnyError(read(path)) // &quot;&quot; on any error
</code></pre>
So right now this doesn&#x27;t seem THAT different than using try/catch to select values depending on the type of error &quot;thrown&quot;. But its critical to notice that we are going through normal programming control flow here (we pass in the result value, not some sort of weird function wrapper function that wraps read and inserts a try/catch). This becomes much more apparent how its useful when you have more interesting tasks:<p><pre><code>    var filenames = [..,...,..];
    var concated = filenames.reduce(pipe(read, emptyStringOnDoesntExist, concat), &quot;&quot;);
</code></pre>
So now we&#x27;ve done something really neat: we are concating a bunch of files, and accepting some may not exist, BUT if any of them have a permission error the whole thing will return Either _ [PermissionError]. Now are errors are ACTUALLY composable.",1441057604

For people who can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t pay, you can provide good instructions on how to set up the VM if people don&#x27;t want to pay. Give people 30 days notice, and give them benefits for signing up, e.g. 20% discount for life of their account.<p>Look at partnering with teaching institutions that are using your software. Offer them a discount on a class purchase of accounts, or sell them support running the VM on their own infrastructure (perhaps integrating with Moodle or their auth system for an additional fee?).<p>Look at how people get value from SMC, your costs scale linearly with usage, so it may be good to scale your prices too.

The distinction is really about whether you need to worry about any possible value, or any possible reference, being null, which you do in languages like C or Java where all references are nullable.<p>Giving Java and Rust the same 4 star rating because they both have some form of null and some form of Maybe/Option is a bit misleading. In Rust, Option is what you use in any normal code, and so you don&#x27;t need to check for Null everywhere. In Java, it&#x27;s the other way around; nullable references have existed since the beginning and are not segregated in any particular way, while Optional is a recent addition.<p>Likewise, I think that in Scala and Swift, null is only present for compatibility purposes, and idiomatic code does not use them.

Clojure does use nil idiomatically, and also has &#x27;(), which may even count as &quot;multiple NULLs&quot; according to this rubric, though I guess that in Clojure &#x27;() is just treated as an empty list, rather than a null value like it is in other Lisps.",1441056479

10149194,comment,10148972,10149129,0,0,geofft,,,"If you have a language with enum types (Haskell, ML, etc., or any of the languages inspired by them like Rust, Scala, etc.), that&#x27;s straightforward. In e.g. Rust, you&#x27;d have<p><pre><code>    enum Connection {
        ValidConnection {fd: RawFd, address: SockAddr, ...},
        BadAddr,
        BadPort,
        ...
    }
</code></pre>
In fact Rust&#x27;s representation of the maybe type is just a generic<p><pre><code>    enum Option<T> {
        Some(T),
        None,
    }
</code></pre>
so all you&#x27;re doing is getting rid of the two layer Option<Connection> syntax and making it a single Connection, so you&#x27;re not writing Option<this>, PossiblyBadAddress<that>, etc. everywhere.<p>Then all your call sites can do one of two things. Either they can check for specific errors, like<p><pre><code>    match conn {
        Connection {fd, address, ..} => write(fd, ...),
        BadAddr => /* handle error */,
        BadPort => /* handle error */,
    }
</code></pre>
or you can write a simple function that throws an exception, if you really want an exception-handling style:<p><pre><code>    impl Connection {
        fn get_fd(&self) -> RawFd {
            match *self {
                ValidConnection {fd, ..} => fd,
                BadAddr => panic!(&quot;The given address was not correct&quot;),
                BadPort => panic!(&quot;The given port was not correct&quot;),
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
and then call conn.get_fd(). For a simple command-line app, panicking and aborting is pretty much what you&#x27;d want to do anyway. For a test suite, panics are caught per test case (and you can even test that a function <i>does</i> panic with a given message), so it&#x27;s very testable.",1441056372

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are valid cases for this, and Maybe is certainly preferable to null across the board, but I think the movement to Maybe in the greater programming space will in many cases practically result in trading one set of explicit errors (crashes) for (a more subtle?) set of errors (behavioral). In particular, this style of programming will become frequent (from Swift documentation):<p><pre><code>   if let roomCount = john.residence?.numberOfRooms {
      println(&quot;John&#x27;s residence has \(roomCount) room(s).&quot;)
   } else {
      println(&quot;Unable to retrieve the number of rooms.&quot;)
   }
</code></pre>
Or from this blog post&#x27;s own example:<p><pre><code>   option.ifPresent(x -> System.out.println(x));
</code></pre>
In other words, I think the core problem still hasn&#x27;t been attacked and we may end up in the same situation we were in with exceptions originally: programmers will just throw up their hands and wrap everything in a Maybe/Optional and/or just maybe-protect until the compiler stops bugging them. At the end of the day, if you ? all your values then you end up with something equivalent to having everything be nullable and correctly null-checking them.<p>Obj-C had a form of this with nil calling of methods silently doing nothing (so you end up with methods that &quot;conveniently&quot; don&#x27;t happen, and don&#x27;t crash! when the receiver is nil). However, despite having lots of legitimate uses (don&#x27;t bother checking your delegate exists), it can still very silently sneak in to other parts of the code.",1441056331

An elementary particle suffices this definition: It has state because its properties persist at least for some time, and it has feedback loops (interactions with other particles) that change its state. The more elementary particles locally affect each other, the more complex the state and feedback loops can be. What kinds of computation you can perform on such a substrate depends on the rules that govern the particles, in particular, how many feedback loops they allow to simultaneously affect a local arrangement of particles. It looks like there is an upper bound to this: No substrate can compute more kinds of functions than a Turing machine, which is a hypothesis that is closely tied to the conservation of energy and unitary (that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a system equals 1). However, since matter decays, it is doubtful that anything around us can actually be as infinitely precise as the theoretical idea of the Turing machine.",1441055988

In this respect, e.g. Python and Rust both get it right: while Python has a None, and Rust has std::ptr::null(), an object that is a string cannot be any of those, because those are different types (NoneType and raw pointer, respectively). C&#x27;s problem is that a string could be null, and there&#x27;s no syntax for a non-null string.<p>Python&#x27;s problem, meanwhile, is that any parameter could be <i>any</i> type. In C, you can pass NULL to a function expecting a non-null string. In Python, you can also pass 42, [], or the sqlalchemy module. None isn&#x27;t special here. :)<p>Also, to quibble a bit: Rust&#x27;s std::ptr::null() is just a raw pointer, and isn&#x27;t actually <i>usable</i> in safe Rust. Actual safe pointer types are guaranteed non-null and you&#x27;d use Option<&T> to specify that they&#x27;re nullable. Raw pointers cannot be dereferenced in safe Rust. It is true that std::ptr::null() is in Rust&#x27;s standard library, but Foreign.Ptr.nullPtr is in Haskell&#x27;s, and the purpose is the same (a special raw-pointer type only used for FFI purposes), so Rust isn&#x27;t any worse than Haskell here.",1441055861

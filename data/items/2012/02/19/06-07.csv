3608835,comment,3608697,3608697,3,0,citricsquid,,,"I went to Vegas in November last year, it was my first time and I am too young to gamble -- doesn't interest me anyway and I was there for work -- so although casinos were an interesting experience they had no real value to me. Anyway, on my last day I had some time to spend before my flight home so I (with 2 others) went to meet a friend who was staying in a different hotel on the other side of the strip. The instructions we had were simple, take one shuttle then another and you'll be there, sounds fine to me... but it wasn't. We spent at least 30 minutes walking through casino after casino, instead of there being a straight path from casino entrance to casino exit we had to snake our way through a maze of slot machines and attractions, it was probably the most agitating experience of my life. We had a clear goal, get from one hotel to the other, but the entire journey was one big upsell: ""look at this machine wouldn't you like to put a dollar in, maybe you'll get two back!"" and that drove me crazy. As someone who can only cope with structure and logic and things being well defined it was a horrible experience, having a vague idea of where I'm going with things constantly trying to grab my attention sucked. Worthless story but stuck with me and vaguely related to the article.",1329634493
3608834,comment,3606784,3608505,1,0,nirvana,,,"""that constitutes a libertarian-fundamentalist rewriting of how American jurisprudence works""<p>Also known as accurately representing what the document literally says. I find it really amusing that people pretend that the constitution is some vague indecipherable document that requires court cases to ""interpret"".  It isn't, its written in quite plain english.<p>I'm sorry that the facts of reality, and the ultimate legal document in the country, disagree with your ideology. I'm sorry that your ideology leaves you ill equipped to make a counter argument, and thus instead choose to characterize me personally.<p>The definition of libertarianism is ""Someone who believes in the nonaggression principle.""  I'm not afraid to stand behind my principles, though you have not mentioned what ideology leads you to attack me in this way.  Whatever it is, obviously you want to initiate force against innocent people[1], so, by definition, you'll never have the moral high ground.<p>I am, however, quite fascinated that, despite people being obviously against the non-aggression principle, that I've yet to meet one who can make a counter argument against it. I really wonder why that is so.  I can defend my arguments against attacks on them, but always it is the case that opponents attack me, instead of my arguments.   The only possible reason I can think of for that is that my opponents follow ideologies the are not based on principle, but are instead a collection of beliefs that they swallow whole.  That would explain why they cannot defend them, or construct counter arguments to philosophically based positions, such as mine.<p>All they seem to be capable of mustering is name calling-- like you called me ""far out"" ""uninformed"" ""wrong"", ""misleading"", ""fundamentalist"", etc, without never once backing up these claims, making them essentially pure ad hominem.<p>If your ideology is strong enough to hold such sway over your thinking, why doesn't it provide you with arguments you can make on the facts, and to the point?<p>Calling me names is really easy.  But who do you expect to persuade that way?  People who already agree with you?<p>[1] Because if you didn't, you'd have no motivation to hate libertarianism with such fervor.  All libertarian positions derive from this principle, and this principle can be derived philosophically from basic moral premises.  When I first became aware of it, I figured it would quickly sweep the nation-- as the idea of not using violence against the innocent seems compellingly right.  However, I've been forced to accept that many people, either because they are taught it, or maybe just by their nature, actually do want to use violence against other people for their own profit. And that's sad.  But its also embarrassing and so nobody wants to admit it, and so maybe that is why you chose to call me names.",1329634491
3608833,comment,3607217,3607457,2,0,vacri,,,"One of the (many) flaws with libertarian dogma is the assumption that a person can be intelligently informed about every aspect that might affect them, from social effects of libraries to air quality to choosing services right down to who picks up the garbage. Building regulations? Who needs those, right? Let's just replace it by doing 'buyer beware' and making every purchaser of a property have to do an in-depth research of everything, down to what kind of metal the pipes were made out of.<p>Volunteer charity also only works for <i>visible</i> problems. There's no need for it to go away, but to suggest it could replace (and improve on!) governmental social services is just silly. Everyone gave money to Katrina funds... when it happened. What percentage of the original donators were still donating 6 months later? 12 months? 24 months? Same question for Haiti. Private charity is good for the initial burst for visible causes, but it sucks for ongoing support on the grand scale.",1329634384

3608812,comment,3607913,3608037,1,0,mcknew,,,"Many people probably have no immediate interest in becoming a fan of their favorite mop. However, given the overall user volume and degree by which users are encouraged to participate in such information sharing activities without any obvious downside, even mid-sized brands seem to have a fair number of fans. It also probably helps that nearly every FB contest requires that users fan the brand these days. ;)<p>Anyway, I think there's something about having people you trust and/or admire (friends, celebrities) publicly depicting their interest in a brand. It almost seems like a means to lower the barrier for a kind of ""automated word-of-mouth"" advertising. Besides, clicking to a brand fan page without leaving the comfortable and relatively familiar neighborhood of facebook's interface is awfully easy.<p>Now, how that actually plays out when applied to marketing & sales? I don't know. Can't say I recall Facebook influencing my purchasing habits in some manner, but who knows. Perhaps I might subconsciously choose brand A over B due to how frequently A showed up in my feed when dealing with a product when I would otherwise not have any strong feelings in either direction.  Or more importantly, perhaps by becoming a fan of a brand/product/whatever, suddenly I've become a qualified lead for future marketing purposes in the eyes of that brand.<p>In general it seems like the Facebook allure has at least some to do with being a part of the next big thing. There's a certain degree of cool and relevance by association that comes with being on Facebook, much like brands were once pushing their MySpace pages in a similar manner---although perhaps with less fervor back then.<p>The barrier to entry is just so bloody minimal in trying out new sites like Facebook that I'd imagine for many it's worth the implementation costs to at least see how things play out.  That being said, it's interesting that brands have been using valuable marketing dollars to promote their facebook pages instead of properties which they actually own and have complete control over. Whether we're talking print ads or television commercials, I recall having seen a fair number of references to facebook.com/brand while completely leaving out www.brand.com. It's rather interesting... and like you indicated, these brands are basically promoting facebook in the process.",1329633589

To counter this, you talked about <i>indirect</i> effects:<p><pre><code>  > Maybe serving the middle class by producing a highly qualified workforce eventually helps the poor more than just throwing money at libraries.\n</code></pre>\nHow can you prove this?

In other words, degrees are being treated as an <i>inelastic good</i>. Therefore students are willing to pay whatever they can afford.

3608783,comment,3607217,3608730,1,0,Retric,,,"But, Public Benefit always = Sum of all Private Benefits.  You may be thinking direct benefit vs external benefit, but as everyone utility functions are separate their share of the public benefit is different.  I specifically mentioned my personal cost (as a share of the public cost) and my personal (indirect) benefit to help clarify the issue, but I think you missed that point.<p>Cost and benefit are also independent.  It possible for a Polio vaccine to provide 100,000 times the public benefit relative to it's cost  (eliminating a disease for all time can easily be worth vaccinating people on the other side of the planet).  Research can also easily have that magnitude benefit ratio's.<p>And (public benefits) / (public costs) is only negative if public benefits or public costs are negative you might be thinking Benefits - Costs but that does not really fit the rest of your equations either.  Anyway, the idea that public subsidy's should not exceed the ratio of (individual benefit) / (public benefit) sounds good until the public benefit exceeds the cost at which point there is little for an individual to pay the costs.<p>PS: There is a reason people get PHD's in economics it's a lot more complex than you might think.  Just consider adding different levels of diminishing returns to all of those cost benefit equations and your still barely scratching the surface.",1329631339

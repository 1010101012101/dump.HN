And if yc got 38 % on the dollar they had to have been holding common stock (or something like it I am unaware of) or they would have at least got their money back.<p>Preferred shares don't really make sense for YC given the amount they are investing and the valuation at which they are doing it. It would be like hedging against exits below 100k, at which point, why would they even care. <p>I'm guessing convertible debt would be odd for them as well for one of the reasons given by Costolo and others: as soon as YC invests they are concentrated on raising the valuation of the company as high as possible, convertible debt would put them slightly at odds with this.

A lot of people present software implementations, but the choice of an implementation is step 5, and I'm still hung up on step 2 :)<p>I'm trying to figure out how people made the decision to use that implementation.  What factors were weighed?  gmail makes the claim that they store a lot of information in RAM, and don't use a DB server.  Any good articles about gmail's architecture?<p>thank you!

I rather see it as things don't disappear; they transformed.<p>Microsoft realized it would die if they didn't react with their environment. They know they where gonna get hit in their software department, so... While people were concerned with Microsoft and its monopoly in the OS market, they realized they needed to expand and eventually transform.<p>People, may I say they own the gaming industry, and Nintendo. But according to reg stats whichever gaming system comes out firsts wins the market. Hello Xbox360 ~ Microsoft's new empire.<p>Windows is dead. That is true.

I've tried to understand literary theory and had zero success. I just assumed that either I wasn't trying hard enough or just wasn't smart enough. But you suggest they _could_ make it clearer, and simply _don't bother_?! That would be...disappointing? Inexplicable?

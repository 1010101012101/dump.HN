I start by trying to solve a hard problem as fast and as quickly as possible in a naive way so that I can experiment more freely.

The solution often changes -- sometimes it&#x27;s the problem that changes.<p>If I were working with a customer or a startup I would definitely &quot;ship&quot; early and often, too, but I wouldn&#x27;t give much weight to these &quot;releases&quot;.

These include low-level details like how a Von Neumann architecture works, memory and pointers, I/O, how the OS, network, and file system work, etc. But it also includes useful abstractions such as data structures and ADTs, algorithm efficiency, objects, functional programming and lambda calculus, design patterns, and big-picture questions of what kind of system should I be building in the first place. (Should I build one big monolith? Should I break it down into pieces? How should they communicate? and so forth)<p>This will necessarily require familiarity with a variety of languages and ways of thinking about code. When you find a particular style of building software that suits you well, you can invest a lot of time in becoming expert at building that kind of system, making it run fast, and making it clean and maintainable.

A lot of hardware people screamed about a lot of the obnoxious software crap in IEEE 754, so, if something survived and made it into the standard, it had an initial reason for being there even if that reason has gone away with time/the advance of knowledge/Moore&#x27;s Law.<p>The original designer&#x27;s commentary about it is:\nWilliam Kahan, &quot;Branch Cuts for Complex Elementary Functions, or Much Ado About Nothing&#x27;s Sign Bit&quot;, in The State of the Art in Numerical Analysis (eds.

9061131,comment,9060832,9060832,0,0,Stephn_R,,,"I would trust documentation with a grain of salt. Very rarely do I find intensive and accurate documentation for distributed systems. However, documentation may be helpful for things such as stand-alone components and REST endpoints. Those would be taken with possibly 2 grains of salt.<p>The one thing that you would never want to do is actually read through the code line by line*. HOWEVER, let it be noted that I mean this as an initial point of insertion. As a Computer Scientist, your first step should be in attempting to ask the right questions.<p>Think of it like a game of 20 questions ( N questions in this case...). To do this, one of the best things I have done is to follow the process. All distributed systems attempt to solve one or several use cases. Define these use cases and then analyze the code basis from there. For example, a use case that involves a REST Endpoint can be updated your profile photo. The use case would define a point of entry (where/how to submit a new photo) and a point of submission (the REST Endpoint). From this, we can search for two components in the system that facilitate this task.<p>=== A good word of advice in understanding any code base is that, nine times out of 10, it is ALWAYS easier to read code once you understand its purpose. ===<p>> Language Specific Strategies<p>As for some good language specific strategies, be knowledgeable of what Paradigm the language falls into. For example, Java code tends to have a single point of entry for most cases. Whereas Javascript (as a functional language) can have several entry points (or even none at all). For functional languages, be mindful of how they are structured. Functional languages are not object-oriented by nature but they can be if implemented properly. As such, try to notice the key differences (i.e. prototyping).<p>> Cloud Debugging?<p>I would not consider it. Debugging should be a constant process of development. Not even the best developers can write perfect code from the start but with enough work and constant QA testing/Unit testing during the development process, any code base can become easily manageable for debugging. In addition, learning how to read Stack Traces can save HOURS of debugging.<p>> Tracking knowledge from Module to Module<p>Personally, I keep notes. I pretend as if I am writing an API document. Nine times out of ten, most modules take an input and provide an output after some calculation. So long as the calculation is sound, I do not worry about the calculation and only record the call to the module itself and its return. Other cases like classes can be tracked by the same notion.<p>> OH THE COMPLEXITY<p>It&#x27;s a necessary evil. No one ever said being a developer was easy. And no one ever said the best things in life are free and easy. I work hard for what I do and for what I want. I love my job. I don&#x27;t think I would ever consider changing careers. Sometimes the complexity does become overwhelming and its hard to handle. But if you wish to know my little secret, schedule yourself some mandatory free time. And stick to the schedule. This doesn&#x27;t mean try breaking away from the computer, but just do things that help you relieve stress. Talk to a friend and have a drink or two. Developing is tough on the mind but it is an occupational hazard in the least.<p>> Updating/Maintenance<p>If it&#x27;s open source, let the users dictate when the updates should happen. I believe in Agile development and trusting the users. But when it comes to updates and maintenance on a corporate system, always try and set some goals for the change. Why are you updating/performing maintenance? Is it to improve the speed/response time? Is it worth the cost of time/labor?<p>> GOLDEN RULE: Ask Questions. Be Skeptical and always tread carefully. We are Developers. We are Problem Solvers. Not Problem Makers.<p>BG: I have 6 years of experience working with Corporate level architectures and distributed systems. And earned my BA in CS minor in Information Systems. In my time, I have worked with multiple functional, object-oriented, and web based languages. I have also worked as a Full-Stack Developer for roughly 3 years now.",1424160655

I prefer to understand the system itself (ie: understand the stack and how everything fits in). IOW, understand what layers exist and how exactly are they stacked. Again <i>without</i> looking at the codebase, rather by interacting with the system.<p>I do this by trying to understand the main entry points for a specific task and follow the &#x27;request&#x27; (for lack of a better term, but it doesn&#x27;t mean a http request) along the stack. In real terms what this means usually, is that I&#x27;d hit the logs and see what happens when I do something.<p>Next (ie: by which time I know at least the major layers), I would look at the codebase and identify sections/modules that seem like they provide the entry-points discovered above. Next, depending on the language and tools that are available, I start &#x27;playing&#x27; around with the code.<p>I know this sounds a bit vague but all that I can tell you is this is what works for me and I have gotten better at it over time (ie: experience counts).",1424160393

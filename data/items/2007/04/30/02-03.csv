If you seem smart and want to do it, they'll let you run the company_<p>""Let you run the company"" ? Surely a single round of funding doesn't take majority ownership from the founders?\n",1177901918

18000,comment,17969,17993,0,0,ed,,,"Yeah I like the idea of having an organized club to put on these events but I feel like every other month this exact idea is being proposed. And not only that but there are quite a few of these groups which exist already (google ""site:ycombinator.com meet-up""). No point in creating an undifferentiated alternative. I think I prefer an ad-hoc group where YC'ers can just get together once in a while, drink coffee and hack. Sounds fun, doesn't it?",1177900178

17995,comment,17701,17701,0,0,Goladus,,,"""If only Paul Graham could have been writing 10 years ago instead of starting a company ;)""<p>Seriously...  When I used Lisp in college I remember thinking that it felt like cheating.  It felt like using a graphing calculator to solve polynomials in high school.  The only other languages I'd used in class were C, C++, Java, and 68K assembler, and it was hard to shake the idea that serious programming was supposed to be painful and low-level.\n",1177899629

17993,comment,17969,17969,0,0,dummypointer,,,"I think it is a good idea ! It would be a great opportunity for those who are looking for great hackers or great ideas. Why don't we form a ""Boston/Cambridge Young Entrepreneurs Club""? We could have monthly meetings, reviews of our demo products and sharing knowledge/experiences. We could also discuss different successful start ups, fund raising issues...sort of our own small Start Up school - by Entrepreneurs for Entrepreneurs ! Those who are successful founders in the area can also tell their stories and share their experiences. We could extend this idea to the next level by having investors to give us talks if possible. Any suggestions/issues?",1177898832

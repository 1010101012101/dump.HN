1682228,comment,1681192,1682194,0,0,nanairo,,,"I understand your point, but I think it's an exaggerate view. I am happy to admit that if there's a good reason a rule should be broken, then it's ok too: but you need to know what to do. Like all rules, once you understand them and know what you are doing, then it may make sense to break them.<p>But imagine a user that faces an interface that looks familiar but it's all different. Maybe the most external button in the title bar expand it. Or something that looks like a button has to be double clicked instead of clicked once. The point of having a consistent UI for the whole OS is that the user doesn't need to relearn a new interface for each product.<p>That said there are cases where the current UI is not good enough, maybe because the developer has a new, never done before idea. Then it's ok. Apple does it, for example, as do other mac developers.<p>The other exception is when it's a very specialised piece of software that is not for the masses but for a very specialised niche. I consider CAD applications, Photoshop and Aperture are like that. It's not _as_ useful to use the same look because they are software that has to be learnt anyway.<p>However... Firefox and Chrome do try as hard as possible to conform to the UI interface so I don't follow your examples there. And iTunes is loath by everyone as a awful piece of UI, so I wouldn't use it as an example either.<p>Similarly many people (at least on the Mac) hate the completely alien look Photoshop has, or Office. Microsoft did put a lot of effort with OS X to follow OS X conventions, and despite Photoshop not being a mass market product, Adobe has preferred to have a uniform cross-platform interface, and there's a lot of complaints for that.<p>So yes, if you have a novel interface requirement then you are more than welcome to break the OS standards. But otherwise if there's no need (from a user perspective) I don't think it's a good idea.",1284234781

In fact I would go so far as to say that attempting to shoe horn novel interface requirements into local OS look-and-feel requirements is a detriment to interfaces.<p>A bad interface is a bad interface no matter what. Same goes for a good interface.<p>But I think that if you look around at most of the most successful pieces of software across all platforms (by pure volume), very few of them look anything like the prevailing look-and-feel guidelines for their host platform -- I'm talking about Office, Photoshop, Firefox, Chrome, iTunes, GarageBand, iLife...<p>iWork at least looks like a piece of software that conforms to the look-and-feel rules.<p>But then we get something like Aperture 3 which could be something running on just about any platform.<p>Most of the top iPhone apps could be running on anything with a big touch screen (and some of them are almost pixel identical across platforms): Pandora, Remote, Yelp, New York Times, Jott, Netflix, Shazam, etc.<p>People care about app consistency across platforms not local consistency with the OS.<p>Web apps blow the idea of local OS consistency out of the water. I won't even list million user web apps because we all know what those look like, and they pretty much look the same no matter the platform. Sites that try to ""look like"" some OS, end up looking rather silly to be perfectly honest.<p>No, maintaining the look-and-feel of the OS is not anywhere near the top of pretty much anybody's priority list these days.",1284233778

Although I haven't looked too hard, it seems to me that once you get into industry it is very difficult to work on anything on the side without having to worry about things like IP restrictions. I think in California it is illegal for companies to try and restrict you from doing extra work outside contract hours, but from what I gather it is hard to find companies anywhere else that will agree to such a thing (well at least here in the UK). Actually it is one of my pet theories that this law is a significant contributing factor to the number of companies started in Silicon Valley.

I doubt you'd want one as a daily driver though.<p>If you get a jeep made since 1995, it's definitely way more complex. The jeep in the video doesn't have the same emission controls and safety requirements of a modern vehicle.<p>Modern jeeps still shars some of the same design principles. For instance, tub on frame -- they lift the tub off of the frame. The cabin of a jeep is like a bathtub on a wagon.<p>The suspension in modern jeeps is far more complex in order to give a smoother ride -- the jeep in the video has leaf springs on front and back. Modern jeeps typically don't have leafs in the front.<p>Jeep CJ's were the first consumer models available. Some of the older ones may be close to that simple.<p>I drive a jeep. I think it's awesome. For the same reasons I like it, most of my passengers hate it:<p>- it's loud (soft top or top down you basically have to yell to hear each other, forget listening to the stereo on road trips)\n- it rides rough -- you get thrown around\n- it has almost no features. I have a heater, headlights, three speed wipers (off, too slow and too fast), manual windows/mirrors and a button to reset the trip counter<p>Also, it's a bit of a money pit. It's super rugged, but when you take it into the bush, you push the machine to its limits. I'm not really an expert in vehicle repairs (spent my teen years on computers instead of with my dad in the garage), but I'm definitely getting more into it as a way to save money.<p>I get about 15 L/100KM (~15mpg).

We build a mystical, medieval universe atop these real places. You then compete to purchase these venues and start upgrading them, fortifying them for the impending onslaught. (Yup, this bit has certainly been inspired by Booyah's MyTown, but it's also pretty much where the similarity ends). [Status: Nearing completion]<p>Chapter 2 - Learning the ropes: You begin exploring the universe through your check-ins. Play simple browser-based, click-driven missions to earn more currency / XP / karma / health. Head out into the world, either alone or with a band of cohorts to complete quests that require you to carry out recon / defend your properties / deliver packages / sabotage or booby-trap venues / attack other users and properties. [Status: 3-4 months away]<p>Chapter 3 - Choose your Adventure: Races/allegiances that reflect you and your style of play. Richer gameplay that you  can influence (think swarm badges in Foursquare). And much more that we haven't thought of yet.<p>- Overwhelming is a mild word for how daunting it'll be to string together a playable MVP for this, so if you think you'll play, please let us know - IT'LL SPUR US ON!<p>- Please give us suggestions for gameplay elements you'd like to see.

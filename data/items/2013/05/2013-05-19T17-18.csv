There's a huge list of things I can do on the machine with an HD, virtual memory, and a real OS that I can't do on the Chromebook. In fact Chrome will even run better on the machine with the HD as it won't kill off tabs when it gets low on memory. It also won't get low on memory as quick as it has twice the memory.",1368986395

For example, at IPO MSFT had 25M shares outstanding @ $21, total market cap of $525M. Obviously 5M shares of MSFT stock (market value of $100M) in 1986 was worth far more than $100M of cash.<p>On the flip side, $100M in cash would have been worth more than $100M in Groupon stock (at the IPO valuation).",1368986383

5733688,comment,5731164,5731788,3,0,ufo,,,"I think the biggest problem with monad tutorials is that it seems that everyone finally ""gets"" monads in a different way so the monad tutorials that get written lack motivation. For example, I finally ""got"" monads when I was working with a promise library in Javascript...<p>That said, one thing I noticed is that there are two main ""types"" of monad tutorials. The first one is the the one taken by the OP and I call it the ""category theory"" approach. It tends to show what sorts of things you can do with monads and how they work mathematically but they kind of lack an explanation for why you should bother with monads in the first place.<p>The other approach for monads is the ""monads as an useful interface"" approach. One paper I would highly recommend in this category is the ""awkward squad"" paper by Simon Peyton Jones:<p><a href=""https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/marktoberdorf/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Paper...</a><p>Its an introduction to monads that helped me a lot and it also explains quite a bit about the history of monads.<p>Which lets me come back to your main point:<p>> why this is better than the alternatives (like simple function composition)<p>Because simple function composition doesn't work! While nowadays people like to point out that Haskell is a pure functional language, noone would have bothered with making a pure language (back then) if all you gained was all this headache with monads. The reason Haskell was pure in the first place was because its original goal was to be a lazily-evaluated language and that lazyness kind of forces you into pureness. You might think the order of evaluation of function arguments in C being unspecified is bad, but Haskell would be even worse since the order of evaluation for <i>everything</i> is unspecified and some things might not even end up being evaluated at all!<p>They ended up trying all sorts of approaches for adding effectful computation to Haskell and the most successful one was the monad one (the SPJ paper goes over this a bit). If you pay attention, the monad interface forces computations to be single threaded (you can't ""branch out"" monadic effects) and doesn't let you generally start or end an effectful computation wherever you want, meaning that whoever defined the monad you are using can control how effects are started or terminated via what functions they expose in the public interface (Maybe exposes the constructors directly so you can pattern match on them but IO makes it so `main` the only place you can start an IO computation)<p>Finally, this gets us back to notational problems. While monads make things really neat in the type level and as a platform for effects, it can end up really noisy in practice:<p><pre><code>    getNumber >>= (\a -> getNumber >>= (\b -> f a b)))
</code></pre>
So for monads we have ""do"" notation that lets you write things in a neater way:<p><pre><code>    a <- getNumber
    b <- getNumber
    f a b
</code></pre>
This is really helpful and 99% of the time, do notation is precisely why people bother making things into monads instead of defining their own versions of (>>=), like they do in Javascript with promises. However, writing all those intermediate variables can be annoying and doesn't feel ""composeable"". The Functor and Applicative type classes provide methods to do that:<p><pre><code>    f <$> getNumber <*> getNumber
</code></pre>
Monads are always particular cases of these type classes and you can show this mathematically but its a bit complicated in practice because people added monads to Haskell before they discovered these otehr type classes were useful...<p>To wrap things up I would like to point out that most of the time monads and functors are an ""advanced"" technique that lets you take programs that you could already write before but write them in a neater way, with do notation, fmap, <$>, etc. (While its true that you can write generic programs that abstract over the monad interface, you only end up doing that if you are writing a control flow library or something even more advanced like a parser combinator). To give examples of what I am talking about, if you have functions that return null on error you can already get by with adding an if statements after every call (like you have to do in C) but monads let you omit the boilerplate if statements. A more advanced example I like is coroutines/generators (things that ""yield""). You can write this sort of program in a normal language by manually inverting your control flow, storing state explicitly in stacks or other data structures. A continuation monad lets you write the code in a more natural way (and as a library, without needing to extend the base language with suport for a yield statement!)I think the biggest problem with monad tutorials is that it seems that everyone finally ""gets"" monads in a different way so the monad tutorials that get written lack motivation. For example, I finally ""got"" monads when I was working with a promise library in Javascript...<p>That said, one thing I noticed is that there are two main ""types"" of monad tutorials. The first one is the the one taken by the OP and I call it the ""category theory"" approach. It tends to show what sorts of things you can do with monads and how they work mathematically but they kind of lack an explanation for why you should bother with monads in the first place.<p>The other approach for monads is the ""monads as an useful interface"" approach. One paper I would highly recommend in this category is the ""awkward squad"" paper by Simon Peyton Jones:<p><a href=""https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Papers/marktoberdorf/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/Paper...</a><p>Its an introduction to monads that helped me a lot and it also explains quite a bit about the history of monads.<p>Which lets me come back to your main point:<p>> why this is better than the alternatives (like simple function composition)<p>Because simple function composition doesn't work! While nowadays people like to point out that Haskell is a pure functional language, noone would have bothered with making a pure language (back then) if all you gained was all this headache with monads. The reason Haskell was pure in the first place was because its original goal was to be a lazily-evaluated language and that lazyness kind of forces you into pureness. You might think the order of evaluation of function arguments in C being unspecified is bad, but Haskell would be even worse since the order of evaluation for <i>everything</i> is unspecified and some things might not even end up being evaluated at all!<p>They ended up trying all sorts of approaches for adding effectful computation to Haskell and the most successful one was the monad one (the SPJ paper goes over this a bit). If you pay attention, the monad interface forces computations to be single threaded (you can't ""branch out"" monadic effects) and doesn't let you generally start or end an effectful computation wherever you want, meaning that whoever defined the monad you are using can control how effects are started or terminated via what functions they expose in the public interface (Maybe exposes the constructors directly so you can pattern match on them but IO makes it so `main` the only place you can start an IO computation)<p>Finally, this gets us back to notational problems. While monads make things really neat in the type level and as a platform for effects, it can end up really noisy in practice:<p><pre><code>    getNumber >>= (\a -> getNumber >>= (\b -> f a b)))
</code></pre>
So for monads we have ""do"" notation that lets you write things in a neater way:<p><pre><code>    a <- getNumber
    b <- getNumber
    f a b
</code></pre>
This is really helpful and 99% of the time, do notation is precisely why people bother making things into monads instead of defining their own versions of (>>=), like they do in Javascript with promises. However, writing all those intermediate variables can be annoying and doesn't feel ""composeable"". The Functor and Applicative type classes provide methods to do that:<p><pre><code>    f <$> getNumber <*> getNumber
</code></pre>
Monads are always particular cases of these type classes and you can show this mathematically but its a bit complicated in practice because people added monads to Haskell before they discovered these otehr type classes were useful...<p>To wrap things up I would like to point out that most of the time monads and functors are an ""advanced"" technique that lets you take programs that you could already write before but write them in a neater way, with do notation, fmap, <$>, etc. (While its true that you can write generic programs that abstract over the monad interface, you only end up doing that if you are writing a control flow library or something even more advanced like a parser combinator). To give examples of what I am talking about, if you have functions that return null on error you can already get by with adding an if statements after every call (like you have to do in C) but monads let you omit the boilerplate if statements. A more advanced example I like is coroutines/generators (things that ""yield""). You can write this sort of program in a normal language by manually inverting your control flow, storing state explicitly in stacks or other data structures. A continuation monad lets you write the code in a more natural way (and as a library, without needing to extend the base language with suport for a yield statement!)",1368985674

It is a simple, sure-fire way to be able to contact anyone you know, and this is the single most important feature of Facebook. Does Diaspora have a strong chat? It doesn't have chat at all.<p>(2) Facebook groups. It is fairly common for an informal friend group to create a Facebook group for communication, or for an entire class of a university or high school to create an incredibly active group. Most universities have varying groups for varying purposes.<p>(3) Facebook events. It is common on college campuses for fraternity events and other student activities to be advertised through a Facebook event, and anyone who doesn't get invited to these events might feel out of the loop. Many informal invitations to parties between friends are also sent through Facebook events.<p>(4) The user's information page. Immediately upon friending someone, you are generally able to discover their religion, their politics, their interests, and, most importantly, their relationship status. In this way, Facebook is a very important tool on both the dating and friend scene for young people.<p>And, social networks like Google+ and Diaspora have utterly failed to properly address these features. Google+ took months to create events and groups, and honestly now the interface is so cluttered and clunky that I don't think it will ever be accessible to the basic user in its current form. Diaspora has utterly failed to implement any of these features.<p>Young people want a social network where they can quickly discover what kind of person each other are and what their social situation is, share events and groups with each other, and chat with each other, especially on mobile. Being able to upload photos is also important, but sharing statuses and links is probably the least important feature.

This allows you to maintain invariants and makes it much easier to reason about your code, which has huge advantages when you're working with concurrency or parallelism.<p>Here's one of my favorite examples. Say we have a set S and an element x, as in the following code:<p>""let S = Set.empty () in
let S = Set.add S x in
f ();
if (Set.mem S x) then...""<p>If our code is purely functional, then it's impossible that x is no longer in S after our call ""f ()"".

5733555,comment,5732949,5733446,18,0,Peaker,,,"When you say ""add complexity"", I think you mean ""add difficulty"". Because for example, a language that has <i>only</i> one-argument functions, and builds multi-arg functions on top is a simpler one than one that has multi-arg functions built-in.<p>Simplicity is hard -- and pure functional programming is a lot about simplicity, which does make it hard -- hard to learn, and hard to figure out how to tackle various problems.<p>But the simplicity has many rewards. Mathematical simplicity makes a lot of mathematical deductions tractable -- this is what is typically referred to as ""ease of reasoning"" about code.<p>Referential transparency adds a whole lot of ease to the reasoning process.<p>The pure functional approach also means that type safety goes much further. If you forget to hook up your functions together properly (forget an input, ignore an output) you're likely to get warnings/errors. In the imperative approach, if you forget a side-effecting statement that adds another input to some code, the compiler cannot help you.<p>Imagine testing -- imperative code requires tests to build up a mock world as input for the code, and then inspect the mock world that results as an output from the code.<p>Testing a referentially transparent function requires just calling it with differing inputs.  It makes property-testing possible, too!<p>Imagine composition -- pure function composition of two functions composes the meanings of those functions. If those two functions work, so will the composed one.<p>Try to combine two pieces of imperative code -- that's not necessarily true at all, one might mutate data that's in use by the other. Aliasing issues may arise, etc.<p>So functional code is easier to reason about, more composable, easier to test, and gets more safety from type checking. It is harder to learn to use, and harder to figure out how to use it to solve certain problems. With time, however, more and more problems yield to the pure functional programming approaches.",1368983859

I'm doing it to finally pursue my real passion and interest, to take some time to contemplate about whether being a doctor is something I want to commit to (probably not), to get into shape, etc. Seems like a reasonable decision, but to my dad and family, I will be considered an immense failure. Being a Doctor is a disgustingly inflated status symbol in my community, and deciding not to be one is about the worst thing you can do other than murdering someone.<p>I won't be getting any support, emotional or financial, and worse is that I'll be consistently criticized and told that I'm making a stupid, selfish decision. It may very well be stupid, but I won't find out if I don't actually do it. It'll be tough, but more than worth it.<p>You're incredibly, incredibly lucky, OP, to have an understanding and supportive parent. There are many out there who'll never get to make the leap that you've made because of familial pressures and criticisms. Best of luck!<p>Edit: If any of you have an interesting startup opportunity (particularly in health), email is in my profile!",1368982857

6814743,comment,6814650,6814650,4,0,onion2k,,,"Is &#x27;page size&#x27; alone enough to worry about this sort of thing? We don&#x27;t download all the assets used every time we load a page.<p>Just a thought, but the total size of assets on the page ignores the use of caches and CDNs for common assets - if I visit 100 websites that all use Google&#x27;s CDN to deliver jQuery I&#x27;ll download a few hundred kbs and do 99 HTTP requests that return just a &quot;nothing changed&quot; header. The fact that those 100 websites are all a few hundred kb bigger than they were a few years ago means very little.<p>If I visit the same website every day for 100 days straight I&#x27;ll probably only download jQuery once even if it&#x27;s hosting the file itself because of my browser cache.<p><i>Obviously</i> it&#x27;s preferable if a site optimises things where it can, but I don&#x27;t think a 150% increase in total page size equates directly to a 150% increase in data usage. It might for archive.org, but they&#x27;re pretty atypical web users.<p>tl;dr Overall page size is less important than setting caching headers properly.",1385650760

If you start a new business, and let&#x27;s say you take out a huge loan to pay your startup expenses, and you have a huge pool of qualified workers fighting to work for you for 10 dollars per hour, are you going to pay them any more?  Knowing full well that that&#x27;s a shitty wage, but that if you pay them any more <i></i>you<i></i> might go out of business and have a huge debt burden...  Or do you pay them 20 dollars per hour out of generosity, and risk going bankrupt, with repercussions that could follow you for years?<p>It&#x27;s easy to blame corporations, but remember, there&#x27;s more players in the job market, including many struggling small businesses...

London is an extremely multi cultural city, with both rich and poor living side by side in the same boroughs. A lot of people argue that most of London&#x27;s unique culture in places like Brixton came from the poor and that&#x27;s what made London in a lot of ways great.<p>If you say, everyone in London will need a job, then you are then moving the poor / unemployed on mass out of the city. On paper this may look great, but for social-economic reasons this is a disaster.<p>You would end up with a &#x27;walled garden&#x27; of elite living in London and the poor / unemployed living outside.

There is also control, to make sure the money the unemployed person is getting is mostly spent on the basics (such as housing, rather than say drugs).<p>The problem with suddenly giving everyone a minimum amount of money, is that due to everyone now &#x27;at least&#x27; having that amount of money at hand, this becomes the new &#x27;bottom&#x27; of the market. If I get a job, I earn money on top of this basic amount, which means I can afford nice things and the person unemployed still can&#x27;t afford anything.<p>To clarify, this works similar to pricing of items in different markets. A beer in the UK is ~£3.50 (£5 in London), a beer in Vietnam is about 14 pence. Both costs are fairly relative to what they would have to pay their work force to produce the item (plus cover costs and make a profit) and what the local market can afford to pay.<p>If let&#x27;s hypothetically say, you gave everyone in Vietnam this basic wage, the cost of beer would not remain at 14 pence. The first reason is because the work force would find their existing pay negligible compared to the basic pay (so wages would have to rise to be incentive to work on top of basic pay) which would in turn cause cost of manufacturing to rise, but also the market would realise with this extra money available - the price could be set higher and would rise accordingly.<p>Now back in the UK if this was to occur, you would have slight price rises due to these factors which would in affect move the poverty line up higher, which would mean the people at the bottom are still poor relatively.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that assuming the people who are unemployed are given the choice on how that money is spent, they may in fact not spend the money sensibly (i.e. on their housing) and end up homeless instead.<p>The final problem with this model is that the cost of living and economic output is not evenly distributed throughout a country. £1750 a month in northern England may give you a fantastic lifestyle, where as in London you&#x27;d barely cover your rent. (What happens to the unemployed in London in a fixed give everyone a basic income situation? They have to leave London and move where they can afford, which then makes it potentially harder to find a job and splits the country into two halves, the elite / the poor).",1385648286

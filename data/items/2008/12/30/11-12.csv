Throwing good money (time, stress, your dwindling sanity) at this situation is not going to come out in your favor.<p>You've already got your answer. You're the most miserable and depressed ever? Who on earth would listen to that line and tell you to stay? It's time for you to leave.<p>Now you just have to work out the specifics.<p>Don't wait til you're broke, though, because then you'll be really desperate.<p>Don't confuse the ""when it's not there, I want it"" feeling with genuinely missing it, because that's pretty much the stereotypical situation with any abusive relationship. Once you're truly free from it, your overall feeling is going to be like there's a giant weight that just lifted from your shoulders.<p>You can get through this. You've already taken the big step of admitting you're miserable & seeking a solution.<p>Best of luck.",1230638193

E.g. if you're worth $x/hr to implement something from scratch for one customer, you ought to be worth $n*x/hr to do the same or similar work for another, since now you have experience, reusable code, a reputation, etc. There is a limit obviously, but it's not clear when you start what exactly it might be.",1230637617

As in, somebody intends that calling Kevin Rose a boy billionaire becomes a media coup. It's intentional.<p>The rest of the essay supports that point.",1230637589

The most painful part of a project is still IE-compatibility but no longer just because of general quirkiness - it's more about being forced off of Firebug to make edits.",1230637123

414143,comment,413116,413258,0,0,adamt,,,"Where do people get the notion that EC2 bandwidth is expensive from?  Pricing is $0.17 per GB for first 10,000 GB and drops after that. $0.17 per GB is actually pretty cheap, and unless your shipping large amounts of high quality video, you are unlikely to rake up a big bandwidth bill.<p>Slicehost (which I am a customer of and have absolutely nothing against) seems cheap if you look at the bundled bandwidth, but they can do that on the basis that most people (e.g. me!) don't use anything like their quota. If you want more on top, their FAQ says that pricing for extra bandwidth starts at $0.30 per GB.",1230636685

I miss the visual file trees and the easy visual debugging, though I haven't completely gotten used to the emacs way of doing things yet.

The resulting filtering ended up causing a lot of trouble for folks not using Windows-1252 or something in the ISO-8859 family, as it&#x27;d replace pipes in post bodies with the HTML numeric entity for the pipe in that charset.  A similar incident is one of the things that got me hired - I was the only one to actually pick up a phone and call their office and talk to tech support about the sheer size of the possible bug.<p>The most fun security bug the previous major version had was a side effect of file naming.  In order to prevent users from just downloading data files, every data file was given the .cgi extension and was always saved as 0777 because shared hosting sucks and nobody ever used suexec like they should.<p>The file format for user records is the login name on the first line, and the plaintext password on the second, email on the third.  Someone figured out that #, ! and / weren&#x27;t filtered in usernames.  See where this is going yet?  If the directory containing member records was available inside the document root, someone could perform trivial remote command execution.<p>The second most fun was people discovering XSS before it was called XSS.  With some creative quoting, you could inject javascript into the markup.<p>I&#x27;m just thankful nobody figured out CSRF, I&#x27;d have hated to figure out how to deal with that way back then...",1421564199

8906894,comment,8906331,8906331,0,0,pjungwir,,,"I&#x27;m curious if anyone really expected Perl 6 to arrive like the article describes (&quot;The problem wasn&#x27;t apparent in 2000.&quot;). I was just a junior programmer, and I loved 5.6, but from the beginning 6 sounded to me like it would be a wholly different language, probably never delivered, and certainly never adopted. Maybe I&#x27;m projecting, but I felt that was a broad sentiment back then. By 2001 I was writing Python half time or more, and even though I felt a great fondness for Perl while Python left me cold, it still felt like it delivered everything Perl 6 aspired to (if you could stand the lack of regex literals, grr.....). Once Ruby became popular we got all the good things of Perl without the aridity of Python, so there was even less reason to care. In the late &#x27;00s I took a few years off programming to do a degree in Classics, and I kept telling myself half-jokingly that if Perl 6 shipped I&#x27;d know I&#x27;d been away too long. When Parrot was released I figured I&#x27;d better get back in the game.<p>That&#x27;s not to say Perl 6 wasn&#x27;t needed. Among programming languages Perl was probably my first love, especially the linguistics tie-ins with $ @ % etc, but write-only was a real problem, and people were moving to Python on the one hand and Java on the other. Maybe PHP killed Perl for low-end cheap hosting, but for larger projects, among people who would never have considered PHP, it lost because picking it seemed irresponsible.",1421563074

8906887,comment,8906518,8906518,0,0,userbinator,,,"It&#x27;s interesting to see techniques that are pretty common in Asm programming appearing in higher-level languages - putting the error-handling code &quot;somewhere else&quot; or otherwise trying to keep it out of the way is one of these. The other one related to this, which I haven&#x27;t seen a compiler do yet, is &quot;chaining the error path&quot; which looks something like this:<p><pre><code>        ; some code that sets CY on error\n        jc some_error\n        ...\n        ; more code that sets CY on error\n    some_error:\n        jc some_error1\n        ...\n        ; etc.\n    some_error1:\n        jc some_error2\n        ...\n    some_error2:\n        jc some_error3\n        ...\n\n    some_errorN:\n        ; error handling code goes here\n</code></pre>\nThe reasoning behind this being that conditional jumps to nearby (within +/-127 bytes) targets are far shorter (2 bytes vs 6) and the error path is rarely taken. When the error-handling code is ahead, they are predicted to be not-taken with the common &quot;always not taken&quot; and &quot;forward not taken&quot; decisions, which agrees with their use of being taken only on error. A bit hard to express this pattern with C, however - and chained gotos, which would be somewhat equivalent, aren&#x27;t so &quot;high level&quot; anymore.",1421562746

I can understand that it&#x27;s disturbing to feel that you&#x27;re being stalked, or even just monitored. But it doesn&#x27;t sound like anyone took action to intervene in your private affairs or intentionally lead you to feel threatened. It&#x27;s legal and at least arguably moral to hire a private investigator to follow a private citizen around, so long as they follow certain rules. Attempting to friend someone on linkedin under false pretenses is also legal and arguably moral.

Since the function usually will have alignment requirements, this often will mean the error handling is in a different 64-byte cache line.  If this error never occurs, this cache line will never occupy space in the instruction cache (i-cache), and useful instructions can be held there instead.<p>In practice, I&#x27;d be surprised if you can come up with a case where this makes a significant difference.  If you are on a hot enough path for this to matter, on a modern processor you probably are running out of the even lower level decoded µop cache, which doesn&#x27;t cache µops for branches that are not taken.  If you aren&#x27;t in this cache, your efforts are probably better spent making this happen.<p>Edit: ot&#x27;s comment about how this affects the size of the parent function and whether it will be inlined is a good point, and might well make a measurable difference in the cases where it is true.",1421562201

There was a bit of stagnation in the days of PHP 5.2 when the devs devoted too much energy to PHP 6 and not enough on improving the current version. But soon, PHP 6 was put on hold and some of its better parts began to be ported to PHP 5. Thanks to this decision, PHP has improved by leaps and bounds since 5.3. Also thanks to the lessons learned, nobody is particularly worried about any breaking changes in PHP for the foreseeable future. Everyone knows that any script that works in PHP 5.6 will probably work just fine in 7.0, so new projects continue to be written in PHP. This peace of mind is very important for languages that carry a lot of legacy baggage.<p>If there&#x27;s anything for other languages to learn from PHP, it would be their graceful handling of PHP 6 -> 5.3~5.6. The syntax is still terrible, and the default behavior remains borderline insane, but PHP since 2009 has been an exemplar of how a widely used scripting language should handle new versions.",1421562047

3454323,comment,3454138,3454270,2,0,giberson,,,"Thanks for that information.<p>Just addressing SOPA from this angle, would SOPA legislation be okay if it only applied to domains that did not adhere to DMCA voluntarily or regulatorily? IE, SOPA wouldn't be capable of black listing any US site, because US sites have to adhere to DMCA. In addition to not applying to US based domains, what about for foreign domains if the site operator was contractually obligated to adhere to DMCA by a legal document that was under the jurisdiction of the domain registrant. Ie, say some European domain registrar offered its clients an opt-in option for sites. The opt-in legally obligated them (in the EU) to adhere to DMCA regulatory operation. Doing so would mean the domain could not be black listed by SOPA.<p>Obviously, it seems SOPA is much more that just what you said since Reddit operates inside the US, however the founder has indicated that with SOPA, it and similar sites would not be able to operate due to SOPA. So I'm just brain storming on this specific aspect of why DMCA isn't good enough.",1326326369

So SOPA won't block facebook, or youtube, or google, or any other US based site. The problem occurs when a site isn't in the US. A rights holder can't send a DCMA takedown notice to The Pirate Bay for instance.<p>SOPA gives an alternative for rights holders when faced with a foreign site. They can ask for the site to be blocked at the DNS level by ISP's. They can prohibit any US based payment processor from paying the infringing site money. Rights holders can even ask search engines to block infringing sites.<p>Basically it stems from ""As a rights holder, what can I do to prevent my work from being stolen internationally?""

Any professional who sells photographs is amortizing the cost of his equipment over many sales. Buyers pay according to what they (and the market) think that particular photograph is worth. The cost of the equipment doesn't really factor into it.<p>It's similar to buying anything on the market - A toaster would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build from scratch (<a href=""http://www.thetoasterproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thetoasterproject.org/</a>), but no one pays that much (not does any manufacturer expect that much) since no one is really going to build one from scratch.<p>The author's argument gets really weird at the end when he claims that if someone misappropriates the image, he would charge the cost of his camera, his laptop, his software - the whole shebang that went into it. It's a very strange way of computing the loss of value to him. The loss of value could be zero (if there was no buyer for that image in the first place - a lot of photographers take excellent images without anyone actually buying or wanting to buy them ever), or it could be many thousands of dollars if it is a piece of art that is highly valued.

The photo editor/art buyer is always cost-conscious, and whereas she used to only have the option of professional-quality-work at professional rates, now there is a huge pool of ""good enough"" photos at vastly lower cost. Buyers of photography, as it turns out, aren't actually that discriminating, so more and more frequently they're opting for the ""good enough"" photo instead of the RIGHT photo.<p>And this is where the professionals start to get irked. It'd be one thing if the new competition were undercutting them with similar-quality work at lower cost. It's be they're being undercut by work that is often objectively lower in value to the client, and they know the client would be better served.<p>It's actually quite analogous to the issue of outsourcing: a vast new pool of cheaper but lower-quality labor supply becomes available, and many firms move operations overseas. The end-product is crappier but cheaper. Nobody actually cares about quality, and given the choice, they'll go for cheaper and ""good enough"" over expensive and good.<p>Interestingly, Apple is somehow managing to upend this paradigm by producing really-good quality product at premium-but-not-ridiculous prices through design and manufacturing innovation and exceptional marketing, and is taking back market share from the mid-tiers. I can't think of how the photo industry as a whole can accomplish this, though, since it's B2B rather than B2C, and it's an army of independent professionals and not a unified association. (There's a legal limit on how much the industry can coordinate: the major photographers' trade organization was fined for price-fixing years ago becaused they had published pricing guidelines.)<p>(DISCLAIMER: I worked in the photo industry for years, and still shoot the occasional assignment)",1326325499

More specifically, that sexist guys in tech are keeping women out. Even when not stated explicitly, this accusation has been made many, <i>many</i> times, and underlies every discussion about this topic.<p>But the immediate assumption when it comes to nursing is almost never that women in nursing programs mistreat men. In fact, I've almost never heard that accusation, even though it's considered the null hypothesis when it comes to ""women in tech"". People are much quicker to look for other explanations, for instance that men are more likely to be bothered by the working conditions, pay, autonomy, etc. than women are.<p><i>I'm sure you can come up with reasons why men may choose not to make their living caring for children, even though they'd prefer to do so.

It shows a variance ratio of 1.1-1.2 across many countries (though not all).</i><p>This was the most glaring example of statistical dishonesty in this paper: their data shows with perfect clarity that there's a > 1.0 male/female variance ratio for almost every country in the set, and I encourage anyone interested in this to look at their graphs and draw your own conclusions (<a href=""http://imgur.com/39pja"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/39pja</a>). To me, it looks like a typical noisy measurement (the authors note that the variation within a single country was about 20% from test to test, so we should expect a decently wide distribution (well, the authors don't actually admit that - as a first mathematical blunder in a series of many, they claim that 20% variation is very small and means we should expect a tight distribution)) with a mean somewhere between 1.12 and 1.15, a variance of maybe .1 (just about right for a measurement with around 20% variation, no?), and a decent bit of skew. Pretty good jumping off point for some analysis and explanation, I would think...<p>But not in this article. The authors merely point to those graphs and claim that they obviously disprove the greater male variance hypothesis. In other words - they point to a distribution of admittedly noisy measurements that is clearly centered around ~1.13 or so, with almost zero density below 1.0, and claim that it proves that the mean of the distribution is 1.0, (with an implicit ""STFU Larry Summers""). When I first read this, I thought they were trolling me, the result is so clearly wrong.<p>[As an aside, it's worth noting that a variance ratio in the 1.1 to 1.2 range is enough to explain away most, if not all, of the gender imbalance in mathematics, if we make the assumption that the variance ratio is the same throughout all of mathematics education (which is not likely true - IIRC these measurements were all at the 8th grade level)]<p>Their argument? Because the measured variance ratios are not identical, we should ignore the mean of the distribution. Seriously, that's it. I'm not talking about a statistical calculation showing that the null hypothesis (that the variance ratio is 1.0) should not be rejected, mind you (because such a calculation would <i>not</i> allow us to accept the null hypothesis - a quick look at the graph is enough to be sure of that), or in fact any statistical argument at all. They quite literally claim that any variation in the measured variance means that the entire distribution is meaningless.<p>They also try to confuse the issue a little bit by pointing out that there's a bit of correlation between the variance ratio and the variance; while interesting and certainly worthy of further explanation (not done in this paper), this is completely and utterly irrelevant to the variance hypothesis, yet they imply that it somehow disproves it as well.<p>Quite frankly, the referees should have caught this, I can't remember the last time I've seen such bad statistical reasoning in a legitimate math journal. There are glaring issues all over the rest of the paper, too, where they've filtered and re-filtered data many times until they obtain the correlations that they want, where they chop data into bins in suspect ways, etc., but to actually enumerate all these errors in detail would make this a much longer rant.<p>It's a shame, too, because it appears that some of the article is solid, and it presents some interesting data that definitely warrants more investigation; unfortunately, they went absolutely bananas in several places, drawing completely unfounded conclusions from the data they generated, so I would be hesitant to cite this paper as proof of anything.",1326322978

What i meant to say is that the world is open to smart entrepreneurs. Its rare talent thats welcomed everywhere. If you sure that on some reason you cant do something in Manchester there is nothing to stop you from moving to anywhere from China to US.<p>Problems with US ""immigration"" for entrepreneurs are mostly overrated. In fact most of entreps dont need to immigrate until they ""make it"".<p>Been there. Done that.<p>If you really want - you can do that rather simply after making some research online. Not talking about getting citizenship or green card here(although its also quite double). Especially if you are from UK. So to me its a weak excuse, sorry.<p>PS: Proof - even YC accept foreign teams without any hassle.",1282208303

The most laughable thing though is believing that removing tenure will encourage teaching. <i>What?</i> My dad has a saying -- you're only as good as your last grant. My school charges $50k per student per academic year, a decent portion of which goes to fixed costs. You know what keeps the lights on? Not student tuition. We recently sold IP rights for Lyrica to drug companies for $700 million. We have ~8,000 students. You do the math.<p>I have said it before and I will say it again: <i>major research universities are not about teaching students.</i> Harvard isn't making the big bucks for its endowment through simple education.<p>Getting rid of tenure doesn't help any of that. If anything, it removes the option the tenured professors have of focusing on teaching. That said, if tenure disappears I don't really care. I would hope that it would cause universities to decide to pay people other than the tenure track professors decent wages but I really don't see any chance of that no matter what way this goes.",1282206108

If you abolished the tenure system, there is no chance at all that the majority of current scientists would stay in the field - the freedom that comes with tenure to pursue whatever interests you is the only reason to stay and work the ridiculous hours required of post doc researchers.<p>It's a beautiful idea that people would work for 1/3 the market rate because the work is so interesting, but it doesn't hold water. If you work as a researcher at Google, Microsoft or IBM, do you get paid 1/3 of a senior developer position? Abolishing the tenure system would see <i>even more</i> of the current brain drain from academia to industry.<p>Changing the tenure system <i>is</i> feasible. What really needs to be done is to split professorship into three paths: project management and administration, technical work and teaching. A professor should pick one main area, and one minor area and stick with them. It won't happen because all the prestige is in technical work and all the power is in administration. There would be few professors choosing to teach, and few professors willing to admit that they don't do any technical work. Everyone would claim to do technical work but actually politic and scheme, and to change things you would need the enthusiastic consent of exactly the guys that play the system the best.<p>By the way, in the point alluded to in the article that universities pay a lot of money to professors: professorial salaries have not inflated all that much in the past 30 years. Vice principals' salaries have, consultancy services have and centralised administration has. To the best of my knowledge, the inflated money has gone to purchase huge IT systems and employ a lot more student support services and student monitoring, at least in my experience.

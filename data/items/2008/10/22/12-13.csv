He may be right, but we have no way of even beginning to examine the correctness of his arguments, since he didn't present any arguments.",1224679924

They are not. The mythical man-month has already shown that extra money won't make your software ship sooner if it's already late.<p>Time, quality and cost are related, but not directly. They are all functions of your team. A small team of expert hackers working in a smooth, tight process will deliver software quickly, of a high quality, and at a low cost. Take Github for example - 2-3 people who delivered world-class quality software in a few months, while holding down full-time jobs.<p>Conversely, a ""bad"" team or bad processes will deliver low quality that's inordinately expensive, and late - all quite consistently.<p>The solution, as always, is to get good people. Not many of them, and they don't have to be expensive, but they have to be good.",1224678082

I do not write on my web log in search of some form of hype. The reason I do write on it, is to serve two purposes: To keep track of stuff that I know I will eventually forget (and it will be extra fun to re-read it later :)), and to communicate some form of information to my friends and family.<p>Maybe, now that I think of it, it might be more interesting to start storing carrier pigeons or messages inside bottles, hmmmm...",1224677708

He authored well-known chess books such as Chess: 5334 Problems, Combinations, and Games and Reform Chess, a survey of chess variants.<p>Although he himself is a modest chess player, Polgár is an expert on chess theory, owning over 10,000 books about chess. He is interested in the proper method of rearing children, believing that ""geniuses are made, not born"". Before he had any children, he wrote a book entitled Bring Up Genius!, and asked for a wife who would help him carry out the experiment. He found one in Klara, a schoolteacher, who lived in a Hungarian speaking enclave in the Ukraine. He married her in the USSR and brought her to Hungary. They have three daughters. He homeschooled his three daughters, primarily in chess, and all three went on to become strong players. An early result was Susan winning the Budapest Chess Championship for girls under 11 at the age of four""",1224677397

People will appreciate the consideration.<p>There are cases when may not have the time to reply immediately to all questions (e.g. small team). In that situation common sense will tell you which ones are more pressing, I guess.<p>Going a little off topic, one thing I've been noticing that works pretty well (especially in agile environments), if you can afford it time-wise of course, is to have one person exclusively dedicated to support for a week. Then rotate to another person next week. That will both keep the requesters happy to get answers on time, but also the repliers, who can fully focus on other things when they are not ""support person of the week"".",1224677153

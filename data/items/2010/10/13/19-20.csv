I was talking to a friend and told him about a few unique bits of Apple Hardware.<p>1)  The touchpad.  There's a reason people now use the Apple Touchpad on desktops.  It works really well.\n2)  Battery Life.  I frequently sit through 5-6 hours of class on a single battery charge.  My MBP is a mid-2009.  I've heard the newer MBPs last even longer.\n3)  The unibody.  I think a few other companies do this now, but the MBP is very low profile, and is built solidly. \n4) Backlit keyboard.  I remember my old days of groping in the dark for various symbols and things.  The backlight makes a difference.<p>OS aside, if I were looking for a new laptop, these are the things I would look at.  CPU speed doesn't effect me nearly as much as Battery life.  4GB RAM is pretty standard these days.<p>As far as OS X is concerned, I develop ""in the cloud"".

We're working with real dealers behind the scenes, calling them if we have to. We don't use automated systems (not because it's impossible, but because it leads to a poor consumer experience). So there's a cost aspect to it.<p>2. Since dealers can see each others' offers, there's some competitive dynamics at play here too. The nth dealer to join often thinks that s/he has a worse chance of winning the deal because other dealers got there first. The effect varies proportionally (possibly exponentially) with the number of dealers participating. We don't want to promise 5-7 dealers if we can only realistically get 3-5.<p>3. We split-tested the value propositions for our plans, especially around # of dealers. What we've got now seems to work pretty well in terms of driving people to pick the plan we want them to pick (Plus).<p>4.

Apparently, some characters (relatively obscure ones used for names) are still missing.<p>At the time, the majority opinion at Unicode was ""that's just a font problem"" but you see, it was people from Europe who were pushing for CJK unification in the first place.  However, there are some characters in CJK whose standard glyphs are so different from the Japanese kanji that they are unrecognizable to native readers.

Your not the first to give us this feedback, though, and if we get enough of it we'll switch to a narrower layout.<p>2. Understandable. There are 3 issues here:<p>a) Trying CarWoo! before signing up: unfortunately, there just isn't a way to use the product without diving right in and getting in touch with dealers. When that happens we need a way to notify the user of what's happening within the app. Once we build features that have to do with research we won't require a signup to use them.<p>b) Spam: you are exactly right, giving your email address to a dealer is asking for spam. It's a big part of the reason we built CarWoo! The difference is that we actually <i>prevent</i> you from getting spammed because we serve as a proxy, relaying all  dealers' emails to your email address and vice-versa. To do that, though, we need your email :)<p>We are very much anti-spam. The only emails you'll get from us have to do with your use of the application.<p>c) Changing the signup funnel to have contact info at the end. We split-tested different funnel variations (signup first, signup last, etc.) and what we've got right now simply converted best to paying customers. At the end of the day, that's what we have to make our decisions on, even though it might rub some people the wrong way.<p>3. Thanks for pointing out that issue, we'll fix it ASAP. Again, we split-tested it with email-verification and password-verification and what we've got now converts statistically significantly better (without a big increase in support requests for lost passwords or emails)<p>4. This is actually a big can of worms, but I'll try to explain briefly: manufacturers (Honda, Ford, GM, etc.) only build cars certain ways. Even if you can ""configure"" it on Edmunds or Cars.com a certain way, that doesn't mean that you can actually buy a car with those options.<p>Letting users check off options is actually a nightmare for the buyer and for dealers because it sets buyers' expectations too high at the start and makes it seem like dealers are uncooperative.<p>To further complicate things, manufacturers refuse to release build information and there's no easy way to get it from dealers. So were left with being able to determine builds on an ad-hoc basis.<p>Finally, not all dealers get the same builds, and some add what are called ""Dealer-Installed Options."" At the end of the day, even if you knew exactly what you wanted, there's no way to guarantee anyone has it or that everyone has it. The only way to find out is to ask. And CarWoo! makes asking incredibly easy and noncommital, plus you won't get spammed just for asking (and if you don't buy a car because it's not exactly what you wanted, then we always give you your money back).<p>At the end of the day, we decided to architect our solution so it works really well most of the time (a-la Pareto Principle). There will always be cases where it doesn't, but we're not trying to please everybody.<p>To wrap it all up, a lot of the things we've done don't work well for people who aren't ready to buy right now. But like I've mentioned elsewhere, we're not in the business (yet) of helping people figure out what kind of car to buy, we're in the business of making it really easy for them to negotiate with dealers.<p>Hope that helps. Feel free to email me at michael@carwoo.com if you've got further questions and let me know if you'd like a coupon when you do try CarWoo!",1286998040

Letting you shop around would turn this into commodity market. They do know (at least in countries without strange insurance habits) how much each procedure should cost and how much each of their friends asks for. This is not exactly collusion, but can contribute to price similarity. The same way that you can't find a decent DBA in the bay area for less than 100k.

This means virtually all essential C and C++ libraries mentioned in these posts (I do not bother with ""junk"" - and OSX comes with a sensible default selection, too). The only big boo-hoo is that OSX' Python build is a narrow build, but fixes a socket problem that makes using MacPython slightly unattractive.

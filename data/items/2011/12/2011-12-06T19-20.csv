The employee will answer your questions, then the item gets shipped to the store or to your home.<p>It's not a huge operation, but they do this in a lot of small towns across America, towns that can't support a full store but would still like the benefits of having a location to visit.",1323201573

Specifically, I2 = I1 * (r1 / r2)^2. You can use L = 10 log_10 (I2/I1) dB to determine acoustic intensity levels in decibels. Long story short, if you want to cull sound sources, you need to do it based on both distance (well, squared distance, which is thankfully less expensive to calculate) and sound volume.<p>Even that is an oversimplification: in reality, attenuation varies with every material surrounding the sound source, because its actually the result of the pressure wave being scattered and absorbed.<p>Im sure GameDev.net must have some reference articles on this",1323201550

3320673,comment,3320575,3320575,1,0,Jun8,,,"This is an excellent start for a <i>long</i> discussion on economics, ethics, psychology, etc. that probably would be done better in a cafe, slowly sipping Earl Grey tea rather than on HN, but still..<p>One of the main points of the argument is that<p><pre><code>   i)   It is feared that the rich will take advantage if this is legalized
   ii)  But the rich already have many ways of access to organs anyway
   iii) It is predominately the poor who die waiting for a kidney.
</code></pre>
This argument is strong, e.g. if Amit Gupta was a poor nobody, would his case get the exposure it did? On the other hand, isn't this argument similar to the one advocating free sale for guns, because criminals have access to these anyway and it's only the person on the street who gets hurt?<p>I think the main argument against explicit sale of kidneys is on <i>moral</i> grounds, nor operational, i.e. how to best implement this system. You are selling part of your body, which no sane person in a normal situation would do, so there must be something wrong with this. This argument runs foul of the fact that other such activity, that is on similar gray (or really dark gray) area, is legal, e.g. prostitution, getting compensated for being a surrogate mother.<p>Let's zoom on prostitution. You think it may be irrelevant to selling kidneys, but think about it: you are selling something to a stranger, kidney in one, dignity in the other, that normally you would not do. Many countries have legalized prostitution (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution#Legality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution#Legality</a>) because of the realization that it is not the actual act that should be banned but all the bad secondary factors it brings, i.e. sexual slavery, veneral disease. If these can be controlled, why not make it legal between consensual parties. Still, this doesn't leave me feeling good, I feel an unease that I cannot put a finger as a human being.<p>I feel similarly for selling organs.",1323200474

They're presumably making (what they consider to be) good money writing fake reviews.

Shops are performing a useful function in letting consumers see, touch and try what they buy.</i><p>I used to feel the same way, but now I feel that this experience is highly overrated.  If I could get away with buying all of my clothes on Zappos and Amazon (especially Zappos!), I would.  They have plenty of pictures so that I know exactly what the clothes look like.  Reviews from other users tell me <i>more</i> about the quality than I would be able to discern by simply handling the clothing in a store (e.g. how well it holds up to wear and tear).  If an article of clothing doesn't quite fit right or if the color is a little off from how it appeared online, free two-way shipping solves my problem quickly and easily.  Even in the cases where I have to exchange an item because of size or color problems, the total experience still requires way less time and effort than a single trip to a brick-and-mortar store.<p>The only reason why I think that brick-and-mortar clothing stores might survive against sites like Zappos is that most of the women I know (especially my wife) <i>really</i> enjoy the experience of shopping for clothes.  Then again, I used to enjoy browsing electronics stores the same way, but I sure don't miss it anymore.  Also, the aspect of clothes shopping that my wife seems to enjoy most is ""getting deals:"" using complicated combinations of sales, specials, and coupons to knock the price down as far as possible (in other words, to pay a price I would consider sane).  It's not the only thing she enjoys about clothes shopping, but it's a very big part.  If online clothes prices were to get sufficiently low, they would become such a ""great deal"" that I think she would be unable to resist.  This process has already begun: she buys most of our daughters' clothes, and an increasing percentage of her own, online now.",1323199853

So I quit my job and started. 5 mos later: OpenPhoto",,"Original Ask HN post, http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2184603<p>Almost a year ago I asked if you would pay for a photo management and sharing service that allowed you to store your photos into your own Amazon S3 bucket. The overall response seemed to be NO.<p>A few months later in May I decided to leave my job at Yahoo! and pursue it full time anyway. Shortly after I launched it as a Kickstarter project[1] it ended up getting coverage on Techcrunch[2], RWW[3], and TNW[4]. I reached the goal of $25k on the last day of fundraising on Kickstarter.<p>In August we were the first project to be accepted into Mozilla's WebFWD program[5]. I say we because by this point there was a community helping build OpenPhoto. Did I mention it's 100% free and open source? That's pretty important.<p>What was originally pitched as a ""Wordpress-like"" photo service is now a full fledged photo management and photo sharing platform. The OpenPhoto API powers not only the web client but an Android and iOS client as well (not yet in the app store). I had originally thought it would take me 2 months to build but it's taken me and a team of volunteers 5 months.<p>What we've built is orders of magnitude beyond what I had originally envisioned and I think OpenPhoto stands a chance to actually disrupt the photo space by giving control and ownership of people's photos back to them.<p>To find out more about OpenPhoto go to http://theopenphotoproject.org<p>Here are a few invites:<p><pre><code>  * http://openphoto.me/?code=zd065

As we all know, you have this obvious and unstoppable force of doing stuff now at home online.  More and more people who used to go to stores now stay at home to shop and more and more people can perform their jobs via telecommuting rather than sitting in an office.  Consequently, we have less and less need for commercial real estate space.  My feeling is that in X years commercial real estate will be even more vastly under occupied and will only be occupied by services that cant be done online (restaurants, bars, night clubs, salon).  Maybe as a result the expanding geographic human footprint on the earth will slow down a bit in that Walmart wont need be putting up its next super store.",1323199808

Well, no kidding?!<p>First of all, we need to determine the type of work being done here. If you're in a creative environment, maybe 60-80 hours a week won't make you more productive. However, if you worked in some kind of production facility or in manual labor, you'll be a hell of a lot more productive if you put in the time. The first time I adjusted the valves on my motorcycle, it took me over a week. I took several breaks, I wasn't very organized and I mostly felt discouraged. When I did the same thing to a new bike, it was equally challenging since the parts and process were different, but I forced myself to work at it several hours at a time. I did about three hours on a Friday night, six hours on Saturday and two to three hours on Sunday and it was done.<p>If we're going to take anecdotal evidence as gold here, I might as well mention that I learned complex piano pieces much faster and with greater accuracy the more time I spent on the piano. If I would have studied the music in 30-minute or 1-hour blocks, it would have taken me much longer. I tried. Instead, I could learn and memorize a piece like Chopin's Polonaise in A flat Major in just three days if I spent six or seven hours a day on it.<p>Everyone is different - that's my point here. Some people can work with razor-sharp focus for several hours at a time, and others can't. There's nothing wrong with that. The best you can do is learn what works best for you, then do that. Can you get more done if you put in more time? Or are you the type who can be productive for four or five straight hours so you can have the rest of the day off? Figure it out.<p>Lastly, I want to include something that David Baltimore, former president of Caltech, said about work and academic rigor:<p>""When I grew up, we worked hard, played hard and never thought to minimize our activities because of stress. Sure, people were under stress and some cracked under it, but leading a ""stressful"" life was honored because of the accomplishments that could be achieved by those who could handle it. Today we deify the spa, not late hours solving problems at school or work. Caltech's high-achieving faculty and students are seen as weirdos because of their intense focus, but even here, some graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are seeking a more balanced life.""<p>Source: <a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/29/opinion/oe-baltimore29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/29/opinion/oe-baltimore...</a>",1323199419

This would help pick up paid reviews that were placed over a long period of time.",1323198421

Among linguists, it seems to be basically taken as a given that homophones, particularly when compared to less skilled native readers, are going to be easier for the non-native, because of acquisition methods. I should've prefaced that with the disclaimer that I am not a linguist, but I have worked in the past with linguists on language-related work, both in L1 (native) and L2 (non-native) contexts. Here are a couple of references I was given on this specific subject:<p>1. Van Orden, Guy C. (1987). A ROWS is a ROSE: Spelling, sound and reading.<p>2. Binder, K. & Borecki, C. (2007). The use of phonological, orthographic, and contextual information during reading.<p>3. Ota, M., Hartsuiker, R. J., & Haywood, S. L. (2010).

You don't walk out disappointed in their ability to entertain.<p>What I'm saying is that from a musicianship perspective they're a disaster in a live setting.  Lars can't maintain a steady tempo and is constantly pushing and pulling the beat...I'm sure he refuses to use a click track, but he should as he's just not talented enough to stay on tempo.  I don't know how Rob stays with him other than the fact that he's just really a great bassist.<p>They blast right through the breaks in their songs without taking a breath.  For example, watch Harvester of Sorrow in Seattle from Live Sh!t, recorded in the 1992.  They take a break after one of the mesaures and walk around for a few seconds and then come in <i>hard</i> with ""All have said their prayers..."".   It was an amazing effect and man, we'd go nuts in the pits, freezing during the break and then just smashing sh!t up when they came back in.  It was, to use a word that has sadly lost its meaning, epic.<p>These days they don't even pause between songs, much less breaking at the end of a measure for effect.  They just bleed one song right into the other.  For a guy who's been going to shows for over 20 years it's been tough to watch them stop caring about how they play.",1323198021

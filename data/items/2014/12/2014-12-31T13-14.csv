On psychedelics people can reimagine their concepts of self and universe. They can think about problems in what many feel is a totally new way of thinking.<p>In recent studies at Johns Hopkins, most volunteers described psilocybin (magic mushrooms, similar to LSD) as one of the most personally and spiritually meaningful experiences of their lives, comparable to the birth of their first child.",1420034392

The guitar riff that hard pans from left to right can sound jarring when listening with headphones without a crossfeed filter. With the filter, the sound is more natural.<p>I&#x27;m surprised apple hasn&#x27;t added crossfeed functionality to any of their audio products. I remember discovering crossfeed back in the early 2000s. My audio player was foobar2000 which had a plugin to do crossfeed. When I switched to Mac in the late 2000s, I had to go back to listening to music without crossfeed. It still perplexes me that with the explosion of high end headphone popularity that this hasn&#x27;t become a standard feature for audio players.",1420034337

History is filled with stuff that sucks and people still use it.<p>As an example, J2EE circa 2002-2006 is a good example, with everybody, including its own designers agreeing now that it sucks hard. And yet it was widely used in the enterprise.<p>Your comeback to the other commenter is even more illogical. He points to PHP (as an example of something arguably sucky that people do use) and you respond that &quot;PHP is not a Javascript framework&quot;.<p>So? Did you really meant your original statement (&quot;If it sucked nobody would be using it&quot;) as something that only holds for JS frameworks (and not also for things like programming languages or libraries)?",1420034305

And you can find materials and substances with ridiculous awesome IR profiles that are unfortunately incredible fragile or at least not &quot;engineering useful&quot; tough.  But both characteristics in the same material is where the real story is.  Its pretty cool.<p>There is another aspect of industrial scale use, not discussed in the weeks since the story came out, where for example, nickel oxide powder has some serious issues for lungs, and no one seems to know the toxicology of this new stuff.  I donno where this stuff fits on the continuum of health, if its better or worse that your example of nickel oxides.  It would suck if everything downwind turned into a superfund site, then again maybe its harmless as a charcoal bbq.<p>I guess a bad computing analogy would be its not very hard to find a low power computing device.   Think of TI and microchip pic series of picowatt or nanoamp things.  I&#x27;ve fooled around with the 10F220 series for no reason, &quot;just because&quot;.  And its not hard to find a computing device that does stuff really fast, any ole COTS desktop CPU or high end video card has interesting specs.  But finding a processor that simultaneously uses nanowatts of power while making gigaflops of calculations, in 2014 anyway, would be pretty impressive.  And getting a good ratio of flops/watt while being engineering-worthless isn&#x27;t that impressive, but getting a good ratio of flops/watt while being engineering useful and deployable is really cool.",1420033985

Sometimes, you ignore high-impact risks because the likelihood of them occurring is just so low that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to do anything about it, especially if there isn&#x27;t much you <i>can</i> do about it. Like, &quot;a meteor could strike our office, killing everyone inside&quot;. There&#x27;s just nothing you can do about it[1], and if it does happen, there won&#x27;t be anyone left to pick up the pieces anyway.<p>So I think you&#x27;re underestimating the likelihood of employees copying code (it doesn&#x27;t take anticipating being fired), and overestimating the impact it would have (it really won&#x27;t do a damn thing)[2].<p>Every job I&#x27;ve had, the project code has somehow ended up on my personal computer.

Either the company had provided a laptop or they hadn&#x27;t, in which case I would have to use my personal PC to work. If a laptop was provided, the hardware was slow, or the tools installed were not my favorites (or particularly bad), or issues with the VPN connection/antivirus/corporate spyware software made everything slow. So in almost all cases, I&#x27;ve ended up with everything copied anyway.<p>And when I left the jobs, I had immediately deleted it. But even if I hadn&#x27;t, even if I had taken and used the code (illegally), it really wouldn&#x27;t have impacted the company. It&#x27;s not like I would have been able to approach the clients and gotten them to go with me: typically the client owns the code anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t have needed to copy the code. It&#x27;s not like I could have started a competitor all on my own off of the company&#x27;s own code base.

That&#x27;s like a single-author software project with everything written from scratch: there are some, but not many.<p>Music is rarely made in real-time at a live performance. It&#x27;s usually made in an editing suite after dozens, hundreds or even thousands of individual recordings, samples and synthesized effects are made, gathered or licensed. These elements are brought together, altered, fused, and made into a final bitstream that represents the producer&#x27;s best effort at realizing their musical intent.<p>You can get amazing things out of that process, too. Works that could not reasonably be made any other way.<p>However, in that workflow, the original real world spaces in which the source materials were made -- if any -- are mixed and lost. To produce stereo in a two-channel final recording, many tracks are simply assigned to one channel or both channels at specified volumes. This loses or confuses phase and delay information that humans use for spatial location.<p>The crossfeed filters are another post-processing step, this time in the hands of the audience playing it back, that can simulate some of that spatial location information. It can do this to a greater or lesser degree; the more information available at the beginning of the process (about spatial location), the more can be introduced.<p>Eventually we might see artists routinely producing multiple final products, some of which have been rendered to virtual spaces for headphones or IEMs, others being set for surround configurations or stereo playback. Better software tools will help with that -- a scriptable 3D GUI that places your virtual instruments and virtual audience in a virtual ambience could be immensely useful.",1420032706

The Clojure community (and this is damn surprising, given that the language lives on the JVM, and Java&#x27;s community is so awful in this regard) has excellent aesthetic sense. I haven&#x27;t used core.async or Om for any large projects, but I&#x27;m a huge fan of what the Clojure community&#x27;s doing with the front-end.

I&#x27;m going to call that a cop-out. For a 1-month project, don&#x27;t use Haskell if you&#x27;re not familiar with the language and not intent on learning it. Use Python or Clojure. For a <i>long-term</i> project, you can use Haskell. It&#x27;s not about &quot;clever enough&quot;. Sure, Haskell has some wonky terminology (monoid, monad, functor) and learning everything that&#x27;s possible takes years, but anyone who&#x27;s smart enough to program can develop a basic capability in it.<p>Personally, my choice would be Python for a short-term project, Clojure for the mid-range, and Haskell for a long-term project that&#x27;s destined to go multi-developer.",1420031168

But certainly in London (and Seattle from my experience, and probably many places in the US) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an exaggeration to say that a nice road bike can make a bigger difference.<p>For context, here are some of the roads I cycle down when I cycle to work:<p><a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5110521,-0.0613274,3a,75y,270.36h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sMrNCC4ZHMtQ7zkk_rfZsLA!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5110521,-0.0613274,3a,75y,...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5106455,-0.0835212,3a,75y,283.77h,85.36t/data=!3m5!1e1!3m3!1s_xOo3lUaM5sva-i0wbOu-Q!2e0!3e5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5106455,-0.0835212,3a,75y,...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5118519,-0.0973481,3a,75y,263.9h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s57BLC5H881GjlBNBgxZ17Q!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5118519,-0.0973481,3a,75y,...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5091639,-0.1195712,3a,75y,219.55h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1syTkyVqzKCwT18Tcm9mpsWA!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5091639,-0.1195712,3a,75y,...</a><p><a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.4853524,-0.1432872,3a,75y,267.02h,78.08t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sM_zYTuxmhQmzJuDgCVpBQg!2e0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.4853524,-0.1432872,3a,75y,...</a>",1420030813

Driving for Uber is uneconomical for some drivers in some areas, if the trend continues more and more drivers for Uber are going to find it uneconomical. If the concern the taxi drivers have is that they are going to lose their <i>career</i>, Uber is certainly not a viable alternative, because while it may provide a job <i>right now</i> who knows what it will provide in a years time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-drivers-say-theyre-making-less-than-minimum-wage-2014-10?r=US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-drivers-say-theyre-making...</a>",1420030813

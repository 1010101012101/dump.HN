A simple server side script could pull the JavaScript from the advertiser, verify it, and pass it on to the client.<p>Or use a public key signature and verify it client-side, though that would require the encryption algorithm implemented in JavaScript.<p>However, why do advertisement need JavaScript in the first place?

That physical book is mine to do with as I please, assuming I owned the raw materials in the first place.  At this point, copyright isn't needed: I could contract with those I allow to read or copy this book.  Where copyright comes in is in asserting a right to prevent copying over <i>other</i> physical books which are sufficiently similar to the one I just wrote.  I'd be asserting a right to control an entire category of physical objects, rather than specific objects.  I think the burden of proof is on those who want to extend property rights to categories of things, as an analogy with property rights in things.

501586,comment,501436,501436,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"I have been putting together my thoughts on this very same topic with the intention of publishing this on a blog that I have access to that is read by influential government, finance, and business folks in my neck of the woods.<p>The analogy I used was of balancing preservation of forests with reforestation efforts. The stimulus plan has largely been about preserving forests that have a lot of very big old trees. It's an admirable effort in that an entire ecosystem revolves around a forest and for it to suddenly disappear would result in acute turmoil. But at some point, despite efforts to the contrary, that forest is just going to burn, resulting in the acute turmoil that past ""avoidance"" efforts have simply deferred. In fact, the longer you try to preserve the forest, the likelier that it is to be devastated by fire.<p>We really do need to make economic reforestation a priority. As this author points out, encouraging small business loans is definitely a part of the process. But before small businesses are even credit worthy enough to apply for a loan, they have a few hurdles that need to be overcome. These hurdles don't seem to be very big until you're a one- or two-person startup without much revenue coming in.<p>1. The founders need to cover their own health insurance costs or go without. Living in Canada, I don't have to worry about monthly premiums. That's money I can use for other things. It's true, that I eventually have to worry about paying this cost via taxes. But taxes aren't usually initially high (or at least weren't for me) when starting a very small business. I'm not sure how this works in the U.S., but I imagine most startup founders simply go without and take a gamble. This is probably a good bet for younger founders but is discouraging to older ones and those with families.<p>2. Simply setting up the proper structure for a business, its accounting books, and taking care of any legalities can be a tremendous burden for a startup. I bootstrapped my company and I remember my frustration one day when I realized I would probably need to spend a few thousand dollars and several days of my time to get all of this stuff sorted out by professionals. That was money that I desperately needed for rent and food, and time I needed to do actual work. It does not seem like much if you live on a salary, because it isn't, unless you're a startup trying to bootstrap yourself.<p>Governments should offer cookie-cutter small business tax and accounting structures that offer founders the ability to clearly understand the repercussions to their bottom line. This will help founders better project cash flow a year out when taxes are due. You shouldn't need to hire a professional in order to get the benefit of not paying taxes that you don't really owe in the first place. I'd have gladly exchanged my 100% professionally optimized solution for a cookie cutter solution that was 80% of what I needed but took me 20% of the time to take care of than dealing with all those professionals. Of course, these professionals have a vested interest in ensuring the process as complicated as possible, and probably lobby governments to keep them that way...<p>3. Up here, the government just created tax free savings accounts for individuals (<a href=""http://www.budget.gc.ca/2008/pdf/pamphlet-depliant4-eng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.budget.gc.ca/2008/pdf/pamphlet-depliant4-eng.pdf</a>). I think a similar account should exist for startups for their initial few years of existence and the limit should be $20K per year. Again, it does not sound like a lot of money, until you're a bootstrapped startup delicately balancing your cash flow. One of my stresses, to this day, is ensuring I have enough money in the bank to pay the government and creditors. The amount I owe the latter is always easily known and so it might be large, but it isn't surprising. The amount I owe the former is always a big damn question mark until I enlist the help of a professional. Tax season often feels like awaiting a tsunami. This means my spending on other things (equipment, contract workers/employees) is temporarily depressed until I figure out I have enough money to get through that stage.",1236098753

A mashup between a service like that and Twilio would be very cool, however.<p>Twilio is great for building the kind of phone apps you get when you call your credit card company to get your balance, for example. It makes programming an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) application a piece of cake. Once you learn the REST interface and the really simple XML syntax, you can use whatever language/platform you want to build your app and host it on your own web server. When a call comes in, Twilio hits a URL that you set up and executes your script.<p>I was able to set up a pretty complete voicemail/calling card application in only about three weeks of spare time hacking.

501523,comment,501397,501397,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Great to hear a new Scrum convert and the difference it can make in a team! (startup or otherwise)<p>Couple of notes from an old Agile guy:<p>1) The Product Owner goes away with a startup. Everybody is representing the business. The P.O. idea was always an oversimplification anyway. In reality you have to adapt. (This is true of all of this)<p>2) You don't have to plan every task. Some teams do, some teams don't. Stories are hunks of business value that you can deliver inside a sprint. Tasks are what you do to make stories happen. If you can grab a story and deliver it, tested and approved, without decomposing your story into tasks? Good for you. I say go for it. But it's a team decision. Some folks are just more detail-oriented than I am. All I care about is getting the value to the customers.<p>3) It's a framework, not a methodology. Scrum is a PM framework around Agile principles. It doesn't tell you <i>how</i> to do things, simply the process for keeping track of your team's to-do list and executing on that list. It's all goodness and wondefulness, sure. But it's not the end of world hunger. Just some nice rituals to keep the team on-track.<p>4) The most important part of Scrum, or of agile for that matter, is to adapt. It's okay to totally screw-up. What I want to see is a team that is constantly improving their ability to deliver value. Whatever you read in a book or see in a seminar, you have to own and adapt it for your use. I've found that many folks get the idea of ""process is evil"" and then start to use cookie-cutter processes for their agile teams. Ouch. All of those rituals like stand-ups, showcases, retros and such? They're there because <i>over time we believe that most software development teams will adapt to use some form of them</i>. So start with them for a few cycles, then change it up.<p>5) Because of all of this, there is no conflict between Agile principles and startups. In fact, every startup I've seen that was successful was in some fashion agile. Startups are about providing perceived value to the customer quickly. Agile is about providing value to the Product Owner quickly. Unless you screw it up, it's the same difference.<p>If you haven't looked into it, I'd give some agile concepts a look-see. Even when I sole-developing I use a backlog, sprint, ""done"", etc. Not because I'm a fan, but because it is just the best way of working.",1236096277

What could help more than anything is if Microsoft took a stronger stance on forcing users to upgrade from IE6 to IE7. Once IE6 drops below perhaps 5-10% of the market it becomes ignorable.

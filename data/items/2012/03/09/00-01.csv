The screenshot they're showing seems to point at initialisation of a new object, which actually copies function pointers for each of its methods. That's not needed for static languages which would just point to vtables. It looks like it doesn't use real GC though - object's destructor is called right away on a failed allocation. And the destructor is possible to change too...<p>So something like compiled javascript sans GC really. Or maybe like precompiled python.<p>Doesn't seem very obfuscated either imho - there's a bunch of static data copied in a series of moves. If someone really wanted to obfuscate those, this looks like a fairly low hanging fruit: grab a list of 5+ mov-s of constants and change them into xor+copy of a memory range to confuse pointer detection.<p>Can you see any more characteristics in that fragment?",1331253912

What that large test doesn't tell you definitively is how those variations perform against one another nor does it tell you the likely increase of your measured metric.<p>Furthermore, running tests without adherence to a rigorous thought process (where each variation essentially is a separate hypothesis, with possibly unique covariates, and different reasons why your test might be flawed.<p>Your own intuition and gut need to play a part in the tests so that you can understand the results and so that they don't cause more confusion.<p>In the end, you will end up with results that you could've gotten to 50x faster by just testing the variations you believed had a reasonable cause to do better (just a couple rather than 1000).

I'm not sure about Pakistanis (they're culturally similar to Indians tho) or Trinidadians (never worked with or interviewed one, and if I did I wouldn't have an adequate sample size). It doesn't matter; as a developer you're much more likely to interact with Indians than Trinidadians.<p>FWIW, I'm an Indian myself. And know many other Indians that <i>don't</i> pad their resumes, and are very talented/hard-working people. But if you had a job posting in the US and measured x = %age of Indian applicants that have fluff on resumes, and y = %age of non-Indian applicants that have fluff on resumes, you'd find x > y.",1229305849

The bigger state and local pension systems are some of the largest institutional investors, so their fates are more tied to the market than their member governments.<p>As with any other pension system, if a lot of the trust's holdings are in bonds, and those bonds end up in default, that would be a problem.<p>The government pensions schemes are facing the same problem as Social Security -- people living and collecting benefits longer, health care costs going up (for those that include long term health benefits), and so on.",1229305711

My dad is a writer and he would give me essays and books to grammar-check for him when I was young, so my English grammar is pretty good. My handwriting, however, is so embarrassing.

The point should be to gain timeless insight that helps you grow as an entrepreneur, and which can be applied to all of your future pursuits - regardless of whether these pursuits happen to relate to your current project.<p>Oh, and try to hold off on bringing on action-performers as long as possible, if your business plan can allow for this.

397835,comment,397417,397417,0,0,netcan,,,"This may be true, but it misses a general point that relates to the first paragraph. Separate the world into two types of good ads: the ones you can see working & the ones a PHD can see working.<p>A pretty girl soliciting people outside your restaurant vs an ad in the paper; Search vs banners.<p>That's not new. That's always been the case. But online, the latter had massive failings & the former had a lot of success. This is in contrast to the experience of the other big media's experiences.<p>For most advertisers the nespaper ad/banner is voodoo. If the average ROI is outstanding, then they might punt. But the other type, the search ad/tourist tout is measurable & reliable & understandable.<p>So in bad times you lose confidence in the things you can't see. The voodoo looses out. But you probably don't fire the tourist tout until things get really bad. Theoretically, for mega brands with mega budgets to do focus groups & hire PHDs to test the effects of their ads over years, there is no difference qualitative between a tourist tout & sponsoring a tennis player. I don't really know, but I think that the theory doesn't pan out. Even campaigns in the 10 of $Ms are really reading these kinds of studies, following 'best practices' & guessing. My evidence for this is that their ad budgets go down in bad times & up in good times.<p>BTW, it runs both ways. Good times make companies spend more on 'brand' advertising. Most Search campaigns are always linked to returns somehow & those don't change that as much as group psychology.<p>So 'brand' advertising is susceptible to bubbles & crashes.",1229304397

It has gel ink, like the G2, but the barrel is slightly fatter (thus easier for me to grip). The ""killer feature"" of that pen though is the pocket clip automatically retracts the point inside the pen. I've had a few shirts ruined by forgetting to retract the point before clipping it to my shirt, and this pen does that automatically. When you push the ""clicker"" on the end to extend the point, a little plastic tab gets pushed down and wedges under the end of the pocket clip. As soon as the clip is slightly lifted (or a piece of fabric gets shoved under it), the tab is released and the spring pulls the point back inside.",1229304145

(In addition, Wal-Mart has better management.)<p>In some cases, large companies succeed because consumers want the perceived value of purchasing from a large company. Dell and HP basically own the server and desktop computer market, and there is no reason to assume this will change in the next ten years. People feel that Dell will not go out of business.<p>One of the industries hurting most right now is the automobile industry. GM and Chrysler say they will run out of money unless the U.S. government provides several billions of dollars in aid soon. Ford says it does not need government financing but it has pledged all of its assets in a collateral-based loan. Yet almost no one is willing to buy a car from a small automobile company, they are viewed as risker than GM or Chrysler.<p>In choosing software companies, one factor sophisticated purchasers look at is, ""How likely is this company to be in business 5 and 10 years from now?"" When you commit to a software package, you are making a huge investment in time and energy, far beyond the purchase price of the software. You want to know that in the future, the software company will continue to enhance the product and will be around to provide technical support. This is why companies, for example, purchase software from Oracle, even though Oracle is ridiculously. People expect Oracle to be in business ten years from now. Yes, open source to some extent mitigates this risk, but putting aside very successful open source projects (Linux, Apache, MySQL, how do I know that they will be around ten years from now. Do I really want to writing the code myself?)<p>Law firms have consolidated tremendously in the past decade. Large clients want one firm that can provide experise in dozen of areas of the law and can handle complex transactions that span the globe. In Boston, ten years a 100 lawyer firm was considered to be a large sophisticated firm. Now such firms (at least on the corporate side) have merged with other firms to create 500 attorney firms.<p>In public accounting, the Big Eight has consolidated into the Big Four. Clients want the brand name that only a Big Four firm can provide.<p>There is no clear trend here. In some industries, consolidation is taking place and will never stop. In other industries, it is the opposite effect.<p>James Mitchell\nwww.bostonconvivium.com\njmitchell@kensingtonllc.com",1229302943

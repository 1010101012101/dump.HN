Even if you had just as good algos and index as Google, you likely won&#x27;t have any chance to take market share because you will fail in, for example, local queries which constitutes 10-12% of all queries. Someone entering USPS tracking in search box won&#x27;t see delivery time. Someone else entering flight number won&#x27;t see its status. A kid entering 100+200 won&#x27;t see answer. And so on.

This is implemented using the MIDI tuning Standard which has been around for years. Such functionality is usually not available on simpler synthesizer, which allow adjustment of concert pitch but not much else. There just isn&#x27;t much demand for this outside of professional composition circles, for the same reason that Barbershop Quartet music (which relies very heavily on just intonation for its ringing harmonies) is an extremely niche musical taste.<p>It&#x27;s useful if you want to write non-western music, eg Arabic or Indonesian or Indian styles which have different scalar intervals from Equal Temperment, but only if you&#x27;re very concerned with authenticity. The fact is that if you&#x27;re composing for a Western-music audience you can get most of the &#x27;feel&#x27; of other musical traditions by selecting a suitable scale and playing in equal temperment. If you&#x27;re composing within the musical tradition of a non-western culture you&#x27;re less likely to be using something conceptually oriented around a piano keyboard in the first place. In a lot of musical traditions (and indeed country and folk music in the west) the emphasis is not so much on tonality and composition as having a good repertoire of stock musical phrases that everyone is familiar with, and virtuosity consists in skillful improvisation employing those musical tropes.",1417474637

It&#x27;s always the students whose parents were the most uptight about drinking or those who couldn&#x27;t purchase alcohol yet who were the biggest binge drinkers and most common to pass out. There was one period during which there was a university crackdown on drinking at fraternity parties, and the most noticeable thing during the crackdown was that people would drink a -lot- more.<p>The amazing part about it was when people turned 21, it was like they became seasoned drinkers over night. People who had problems pacing themselves during every party would instantly turn into a moderate drinker once their 21st had passed.<p>I think it would be very interesting to see some studies done on the taboo of drinking and whether it changes people&#x27;s likelihood to overdrink, because it seemed with every crackdown measure the local police force took against drinking at parties, the problem only got worse.",1417473587

Quoting directly from my acoustics textbook:<p>&quot;Research on the intervals played or sung by skilled musicians shows substantial variability in the intonation from performance to performance. These variations are frequently larger than the differences between the various tunings. Studies of large numbers of performances have shown that deviations from equal temperament are usually in the direction of Pythagorean intervals (Ward 1970).<p>&quot;Several investigators have found that performers tend to stretch their intervals (including octaves), even when unaccompanied by a piano. Many choral conductors prefer the third in a chord slightly raised, especially in sustained chords or cadences, to avoid any suggestion of &#x27;flatting&#x27; the chord, a particular nemesis of choirs.

Naturally they are all integer ratios.<p>In the perfect world you have e.g.:<p>+ C major scale: C D E F G A B C, where frequencies of all notes depend on frequency of note C (like, “fifth” from C is G and it&#x27;s exactly 3/2 of C)<p>+ and D major: D E* F♯* G* A* B* C♯* … D (and depend likewise). But now G is not necessary equal to G*, but they are close. So here comes the idea of equal temperament where octaves are strictly 2:1 as they suppose to be, but all notes between are equally scattered (on log scale) in between.<p>So TL;DR: nowadays it&#x27;s all approximation. You can do it perfectly, but only for one root.",1417472291

Business doesn&#x27;t want slow. So if we&#x27;re pitching slow, we&#x27;re setting ourselves up to lose and the speed-hackers are going to win.<p>Our goal is architectural soundness. I believe the biggest fallacy of our industry is we think the only way to get these is to go &quot;slow&quot;. Not true.<p>What we&#x27;re really saying is our industry is short on <i>skill sets</i>. With specific skill sets, you can build architecturally sound systems at no extra cost.<p>If I were to build a house today it would take me much longer than someone else because I don&#x27;t have the necessary skills. I might hurry in which case the house would be shoddy. Is the shoddiness of the house <i>necessarily</i> because I hurried? No. It&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t acquire the required skill sets first.<p>The software industry has no such (practical) concept of the skill sets required to build architecturally sound systems. We have a bunch of well-meaning hackers, and as a result shoddy systems that decay into technical liabilities.<p>Our industry needs to solve this skill set problem. The challenge is that academia has a hard time teaching these skill sets, because they are so removed from the practitioner. And businesses can&#x27;t teach it b/c it takes years and special experience to actually teach it. So it&#x27;s not advantageous to a business to teach those skill sets.<p>So how do we do it? And how do we organize an industry around <i>professionals</i> who know how to build architecturally sound systems and code? This is a very difficult problem for a world that has such high demand for code and such little understanding of what the professional skill set would afford them.",1417472108

Does being bad at typing force you to be more thoughtful and actually make you a better programmer?  Or does it just mean it takes you longer?<p>My thinking is that you are not doing much thinking while you are actually typing, so not being able to type proficiently just means you&#x27;re slower and that&#x27;s it.  So all else being equal, a programmer that can&#x27;t type well is a red flag.",1417471326

That&#x27;s right the usernames could be duplicated, so we had like 10 jsmith&#x27;s.  It would parse the username/password combo, and if one matched, that&#x27;s who you logged in as.  I never got to test what happened when jsmith had the same password as another jsmith. I&#x27;m sure the results would have been terrifying and hilarious.  Apparently, the history here is that it used to log people in using their email as their only username, but someone here didn&#x27;t like that and the vendor tacked on this half-assed solution.

8684171,comment,8680177,8681003,0,0,nwienert,,,"Just want to say I&#x27;ve been here too. I also had supposed gallbladder failings. Bouts of painful nausea so strong I couldn&#x27;t begin to describe. Vomiting for days on end, even water un-drinkable. Nearly every episode ended in tears, screaming, non-stop dry-heaving, brain-stopping trips to the ER, where only Dilauded would calm me enough to sleep and somehow &quot;reset&quot;.<p>After 25+ of these episodes (which would last typically 2 weeks, building towards the end), 7+ doctors, so many scans and tests I can&#x27;t describe, long periods of missed work and play, and abuse of drugs that helped (thankfully none really did much, even weed in copious amounts barely helped so I never used it much). I&#x27;d get so sick from eating I was prescribed Xanax for the massive panic attacks I&#x27;d get just looking or thinking of food, because my fear of pain was so strong.<p>I had my gallbladder removed by the 5th doctor. I thought it worked. I stuck to a very clean low-acid diet after that, avoided tough food (I had developed a hiatal hernia from the vomiting), and took PPI&#x27;s religiously and was fine for 8 months. I thought I was cured. I stopped the PPI&#x27;s and within a month I was back at the ER. Pretty devastating. Now, I can control it. I cycle on PPI&#x27;s, avoid all smoking and alcohol, as well as eating hot/spicy/acidic food too often. I&#x27;ve been 4 months now without an attack on this regimin and I feel pretty confident.<p>The worst part they never mention with undiagnosed illnesses of things are the mental side-effects. I was pretty much ostracized by large groups of people who certainly believed I was either looking for attention or avoiding admitting I had an eating disorder.  I even had a doctor at the ER once tell my mom that&#x27;s what she thought. My parent&#x27;s even began to doubt I was actually ill. Finally, after months, I even doubted myself. The pain was real, but perhaps I was inflicting it on myself somehow? (crazy for me to think back on my mental state at this point). I felt too weird to even hang out with old friends, it&#x27;s not masculine to not be able to eat. Paranoias and fears grew with each sickness and month of uncertainty. By the ended I was certainly clinically depressed. I felt my entire persona had melted away, I was empty. I didn&#x27;t even know how to talk to my mom on the phone, I knew she would immediately recognize something wrong with me. I lost confidence, happiness.<p>Luckily that all returns if you can maintain health. Just four months ago I had reached my low; malnourished, weak, paranoid, afraid, tired, forgetful, slow. So scared of more pain, because at this point I felt I was running low on &quot;reasons to live&quot;.<p>But, within a month of eating well my energy and happiness were back, with two more months I found myself feeling like &quot;me&quot; again, something I hadn&#x27;t felt since those last 8 months of health, and before that since years before.  And the difference was just small changes to diet, and avoiding many social situations that make that pretty much unavoidable.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the moral of the story is. I feel like I did everything I could and struck out, and it&#x27;s pure luck that I&#x27;m still here today. But I guess I&#x27;m thankful. I still am dubious on whether life is &quot;worth it&quot;, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine bringing kids into a world where the sort of suffering I went through is even remotely possible. But perhaps it did help me grow up and gain perspective on what matters.<p>Keep searching for solutions, keep experimenting, don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for help and tell doctors to fuck off.",1417471283

In the future we may develop an SPA as well (but nothing super complicated). My top three choices so far are Node+Express, Ruby (Rails or Grape + ActiveRecord), or the Java Play! framework<p>My primary considerations are being able to easily hire for it, a strong ecosystem that won&#x27;t be past its prime in a few years,  have good code maintainability, and being reasonably fast to market. Performance is somewhat of an issue, but i&#x27;m comfortable using job queues and scaling horizontally with elastic beanstalk, which I feel mitigate some of the performance problems of the frameworks/languages themselves<p>I love the large, growing, ecosystem of Node, the performance, and I like the idea the idea of eventually moving engineers between backend/frontend, but I fear lack of code maintainability will slow us down in the long run. Loopback.io (built on express) seems like a good potential choice.<p>Ruby (I&#x27;ve been suggested Grape+ActiveRecord) seems to be the absolute fastest to market solution and offers pretty good maintainability, but I fear that the Rails ecosystem is waning and it may not be the best choice for websockets. Should I worry about Rails being eclipsed by node and losing relevancy over the next 3-5 years? Is the performance and real time support so much better in node that its worth it to take the code maintainability hit? Is the ecosystem and maturity of Rails alone make it worth it?<p>The Java Play! framework looks amazing due to its maintainability and performance (with web socket support). I think  detecting errors at compile time makes up for its extra verbosity. Is it not mainstream enough? Is it fast to develop in? Is it easy to hire Java web developers with web applications experience? How its its ecosystem vs rails for web apps?",1417471277

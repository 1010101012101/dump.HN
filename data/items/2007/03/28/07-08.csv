6864,comment,6833,6833,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Wow, thanks a lot for the link.  As someone who has not fully submitted myself to the blogging craze, I had some trouble seeing what it was all about.  After reading this article, I am thoroughly convinced that widespread blogging is a very good thing.<p>I guess the main thing holding me back from publishing my own musings online is the thought, ""Well, who is going to care?""  This article emphatically declares, ""Google will, and all who seek information on you in the future.""<p>Google's stated mission ""is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.""  I find it refreshing to discover that a large corporate entity has actually been able to improve the world in a way not even predicted by a typically lofty mission statement, by giving truth a voice.",1175067873
6863,comment,6668,6668,0,0,heriks,,,"A sad thing about life is that after squandering ten years on playing in bands and stuff (point 11), if you eventually do get your act together and go to university and then (point 16) take the default route to a job in a big company, happy to make a living at all; after a while, if you have half a mind, you'll end up realizing that you're getting dumber by the year (point 14), but by then you've also stumbled into a family, and a start-up is no longer a realistic option (point 9, 13, and maybe even point 12 has kicked in). But then it's just 25 years to go until you're retired, just clench a fist in the pocket, produce a smile and keep coding for a salary.\nSorry.\n",1175066847
6862,comment,6828,6828,0,0,Constantine,,,"Well he is right of course, Woz needs a Jobs, or at least someone who is significantly part Jobs to get anywhere, designing cool things is definitely an enviable ability, but without someone to focus that ability you have the worlds smartest garbage man.\n",1175066727
6861,comment,6828,6828,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Does every pair of founders consist of a Jobs and a Woz? <p>Off the top of my head:\nApple: Jobs, Woz<p>(pattern match below)<p>Viaweb: PG, rtm<p>Google: Sergey, Larry<p>Reddit: Alexis, Steve<p>Paypal: Thiel, Levchin<p>It seems not uncommon that the Jobs, if this theory is correct, can also hack, unlike Steve Jobs. \nI don't know for sure of any counterexamples, but I'm also not very sure of the theory. <p>Edit: GRR!

6859,comment,6374,6509,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"That doesn't make sense for the founders, though.<p>It would be in their interest to take as little money as possible early on, so that they give up less of the company's equity.<p>Then - later when the business model has proven itself - and the valuation is higher - take on additional capital.<p>You'll be giving up much more equity if you take a million in funding in the first round, instead of the third.",1175065643

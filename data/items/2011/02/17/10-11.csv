Using processes is a good way when you fear that some threads might crash (but the heck, why should they? how about writing software that is less prone to crashing) but not to make anything faster or more responsible. If you want that, then optimize the architecture, like, assign each tab its own JS thread, and suspend threads of tabs that are not visible. But I fail to see how processes are the magic recipe for repsonsibility. Just because Chrome does it, it does not mean that the responsiveness of Chrome is due to the fact that they use processes. They could just as well use threads and noone would even notice the difference (apart from tabs crashing the whole browser then).",1297939655

The cost of an A/B test is small enough that if it took, say, a sample size of 1000 then it would be well worth A/B testing changes that might make a 5% relative difference. On the other hand, if it takes a sample of 122k then indeed you might well decide not to bother -- e.g., because it might be impossible. Which is why ""it takes 122k rather than 1k to tell with any confidence"" is interesting.<p>(Rough numbers: suppose you get 1000 visitors per day and convert at 5%, and suppose each conversion is worth $10 to you. Then you're bringing in about $180k/year from them, and a relative change of 5% in that is about $9k. Seems worth doing a modestly-sized A/B test for, but if it takes 4 months then you might reasonably decide to spend your effort elsewhere. (Or, of course, not: the actual cost of doing the test is rather small. But a lot can change over 4 months.)",1297937598

Welcome to the party, dude.<p>\nWhat I did was start with IE, make it work, then ""fix"" it for FF, Opera, etc. Somehow that's less fretful than the other way around.<p>\nCross-browser DOM programming will drive you to a good rant, for sure.",1192823864

I haven't really touched Windows as an OS in a number of years (linux and OS X mostly).  I can't believe how horrible the interaction is, ESPECIALLY with IE.  Holy crap, quit with all the popups about adding sites or whatever.  It took me a dozen clicks after I typed in www.firefox.com just to get the page to load.<p>I'm amazed that people actually use IE, it's user experience seems like an experiment in cyber-torture.",1192823592

So I don't think I'm a loser.  Denial doesn't mean those rejected weren't wrong, it just means they weren't right for Y Combinator at this time. ",1192822341

70457,comment,69798,69798,0,0,vlad,,,"Here are some cool things about handedness.<p>We all 'know' that left-handers use their right brain and right-handers use their left brain.  In one library book about handedness, the author had found studies about which parts of the brain are used by two groups of people, one left-handed and one right-handed.<p>For right-handers, it was about 95% left-brain, and 5% right-brain.  However, for left-handers, there were three possibilities.  It was about 60-65% right-brain, 20-30% left-brain, and the cortex for 5 or 10% of them.<p>I don't remember what they were measuring, but a third option for left-handers is interesting in itself.  (It may have been a study about which eye is dominant based on what a left-hander would say, so those for whom the cortex functioned in a different way were grouped with left-handers?)<p>Another book says that in those people who 'hook' their wrist when they write (so their hand is actually lower than their wrist), they do it subconsciously because their wrong brain is being used.  They are NOT meant to be using that hand as their brain is struggling to use the correct brain.  So, if you're right-handed, and you hook, you might actually be right-brained and left-handed.  And, if you're 'left-handed' but you hook when you write, you're actually a righty.<p>I thought about this a bit and noticed that with about 10% of people self-identifying as left-handed, the stats above might fit.  If 3-5 percent of right-handers use their right-brain, maybe they 'hook' and are in fact natural left-handers ('fake righties').  And if 20-30% of left-handers are actually left-brained, then that's a few percent of the overall population who are actually right-handed ('fake lefties').  Those could also be 'hookers' who aren't actually using their natural hand.",1192820586

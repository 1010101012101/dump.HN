9481786,comment,9480988,9480988,0,0,fragsworth,,,"Not <i>all</i> advertising is bad. For small companies and lesser-known products, advertising serves a purpose by exposing us to things we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be aware of. It allows valuable products to gain customers faster than through word-of-mouth, which is usually very inefficient and slow unless your &quot;viral factor&quot; is extremely high.<p>Some advertising (e.g. Coke, McDonald&#x27;s) is an attempt to remind us and make us feel good about a product that we already know about, and that&#x27;s the kind of advertising that &quot;shits in your head&quot; and doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any value to the world.<p>But there&#x27;s other stuff that gets advertised, and we shouldn&#x27;t vilify all advertising just because some of it is bad.",1430668784

9481761,comment,9481369,9481369,0,0,parasubvert,,,"Contrast this to the Alan Kay post currently at the top of the news list.  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9481074"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9481074</a><p>I may believe in many ways Erlang is an evolution to Smalltalk, a better way to program.  But I read Kay and it feels like an educator talking, explaining the reasons for some decisions.  I read this and it comes across as bitter rant about why my favorite language didn&#x27;t get popular.   Kay&#x27;s Smalltalk was never popular either.   This argument preferring Erlang might be right at its core, but it&#x27;s hard to get past the bits of the argument presented that are petty or plain wrong.<p>Objection 1 - Data structure and functions are bound together\nObjection 2 - Everything is an object<p>Arguably OO is a shorthand for enabling two things:\n- message passing based on function signature\n- a given data structure as the first argument (&quot;this&quot;)<p>The message passing thing, Erlang handled a different way through the actor model, one that took concurrency in mind which was not in Smalltalk&#x27;s early objectives.  Erlang is arguably a better way.<p>However I (just me; probably not alone) originally found it hard to understand some Erlang programs because it&#x27;s a pile of functions - the patterns and protocols against the data structures are all subtext and one needs to read a lot of example code to grasp them.  Whereas objects and interfaces make the message passing protocols pretty clear, only a couple examples and I get the message.<p>One of the major nuances of OO and Smalltalk was that the language was only half of the story, Smalltalk was also a runtime and IDE, that made browsing and modifying code a joy.   The image based approach has a ton of drawbacks compared to text files, of course, but now there are plenty of Smalltalk-like IDEs or code-browsing friendly  text editors for both OO languages and functional languages such that anyone should be able to &quot;suck it up&quot; and follow the call chains and interrelationships.<p>Objection 3 - Data type declarations are all over the place<p>This seems subjective depending on the language, and even just wrong.  Inheritance isn&#x27;t required to reuse a data structure, OO design prefers composition.   Most classes are composed out of fundamental data structures that are located in a well defined package.<p>Objection 4 - Objects have private state<p>Alan Kay agreed that mutable state is the root of all evil, or as he says, &quot;assignment is a metalevel change&quot;.  This is why he made state private!<p>I&#x27;m not sure what his point is here, as when you need shared mutable state in Erlang, you build an Actor to maintain and HIDE the mutable state.  Which looks a heck of a lot like an object.",1430668473
9481760,comment,9481074,9481489,0,0,adamwathan,,,"I think about conceptually like this...<p>When one object is &quot;calling a function&quot; inside of another object, it&#x27;s reaching into that object, grabbing the method it wants to invoke, and invoking it. It puts the responsibility of invoking that method on the caller.<p>When one object &quot;sends a message&quot; to another object, the receiving object is responsible for determining what function gets invoked.<p>The most obvious place this difference manifests itself is the existence of things like &quot;method_missing&quot;. That can&#x27;t happen when you&#x27;re &quot;calling a function&quot;, but if you&#x27;re just sending a message and the receiving object doesn&#x27;t have a method that matches the message name, it can still make a decision about how to respond.",1430668454

Of course we then get pissed off when these people talk about justice and even more so when they are either acquitted or not even charged with the serious crimes they commit, up to and including murder. Atrocious indeed.<p>Fixing this situation seems rather tricky since the layperson only has the power to vote and there are no candidates who are willing to address this problem at any level. Fixing other laws that criminalize everyday activity, while incredibly difficult, seems to be the only way to try to go about at least reducing the ability of police to insert themselves into everyday situations they have no business inserting themselves in the first place. Still, at best, it&#x27;s a workaround to reduce abuse, not one to actually eliminate it or deal out justice after the fact. In the case of police, the criminals (police) always get away with it.",1430668061

What really takes place in ideology seems therefore to take place outside it. That is why those who are in ideology believe themselves by definition outside ideology: one of the effects of ideology is the practical denegation of the ideological character of ideology by ideology: ideology never says, ‘I am ideological’. It is necessary to be outside ideology, i.e. in scientific knowledge, to be able to say: I am in ideology (a quite exceptional case) or (the general case): I was in ideology. As is well known, the accusation of being in ideology only applies to others, never to oneself (unless one is really a Spinozist or a Marxist, which, in this matter, is to be exactly the same thing). Which amounts to saying that ideology has no outside (for itself), but at the same time that it is nothing but outside (for science and reality).&quot;<p>- Louis Althusser, Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses\n<a href=""https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/id...</a>",1430667685

9481592,comment,9478806,9480060,0,0,kazinator,,,"For instance, regarding &quot;learning subjects&quot;. You believe that some change in eating habits has improved your ability to learn. Does your belief have a rational basis?<p>Subjects (let us call them &quot;topics&quot;, to distinguish from &quot;test subjects&quot;: people being experimented upon) are not some amorphous substance that you &quot;pour&quot; into your mind; they are all different. You also cannot erase a topic from your mind so you can fairly re-test the pouring after making some change, like diet or whatever.<p>If you have difficulty with a topic X today, you can find the same topic X easier after some passage of time simply because you were exposed to X, and let it &quot;settle in your brain&quot; for a while.<p>There is no way to to have a valid, objective test using the same person and the same topic, where we can determine that the same topic X became easier to learn due to some external factor, like not eating bread. The test is confounded by the subject&#x27;s prior experience with tackling X: the &quot;after&quot; situation is different from &quot;before&quot; because of prior experience.<p>There is no way we can test different topics X and Y, either. If you have difficulty with learning topic X, and then some external factor changes (like not eating bread), and you have an easier time with topic Y, that doesn&#x27;t conclusively show anything. The test is confounded by both similarities between X and Y (applicability of the prior experience with tackling X to tackling topic Y) and by their differences (difficulty in Y is unrelated to difficulty in X).<p>If you want to study this properly, you need large, random samples of people. You need control groups as well as test subjects. One group doesn&#x27;t consume bread (or anything with glutent) and another does. Both learn similar topic in a similar setting. Does the test group show different progress from the control group? Different in a significant way?  Even studies done at this level still have confounding problems that give us reason to be skeptical of their claimed results: such as improper sampling methods, lack of proper control over information leakage in experiments, poor accountability for the round-the-clock behavior of human subjects, and abuse of statistical methods to draw unwarranted conclusions.<p>Then there is the poor amount of data you have gathered (if we can call it data). How many <i>times</i> have you quit eating bread and observed the difference on learning or other cognitive tasks? Sounds like you&#x27;ve only done this once. You&#x27;ve done this once, and, what is more, you&#x27;re <i>biased</i>: prior to the experiment you already believed the &quot;gluten-brain&quot; hypothesis already from your Internet readings, and were looking to <i>confirm</i> it. In honest research, even if we personally believe in a hypothesis, we must work on focus on eliminating the serious objections which tend <i>refute</i> the hypothesis, and not simply look for a few shreds of observations which suggest that it might be true. If we cannot eliminate the objections, we have to face the fact that the hypothesis may not be true after all.",1430666321

I consider myself competent in plenty of languages, including C# and Java. Recounting my experience with OOP languages, relative to the objections listed:<p>Regarding data objects to functionality: couldn&#x27;t agree more, and that&#x27;s why my data access libraries never contain anything of a functional nature within them. It&#x27;s simply good practice, and makes for more maintainable architectures. Nothing about OOP prevents me from accomplishing this.<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with Date and Time objects plenty, and it turns out it&#x27;s really no big deal. If you care about those things in terms of allocation to the heap and/or stack, there may be a point of consideration, but mostly it&#x27;s just a matter of syntactical preference. It matters very little to any applications that I&#x27;ve participated in producing and maintaining.<p>Data-type definitions: the specific comment in the article refers to a location, as in a single file to locate data definitions. Again, this goes to code organization. Separation of concerns is good practice in many disciplines, and this is no different. If a person is sloppy with their code, it doesn&#x27;t matter what type of language they use.<p>Private state: I&#x27;ll refute the suggestion in the article that &quot;OOP says to hide state.&quot; That&#x27;s <i>way</i> too broad a brush stroke. The concept is encapsulation, and best practice says that the scope of state within an object refers only to itself. The article refers to system state, which is well beyond the scope boundary of a single object in OOP.<p>Again, these are all just tools to get a job done.

It is also a vastly more complicated language to implement.  It is hard to even begin to describe the difference.  It leans on the compiler and optimizer by what I consider to be an insane amount, just the rules for initializers and named keyword arguments are bigger than the entire Smalltalk language spec (which is the part Objective-C adds to C).

However, I still keep my toothpaste with my toothbrush. You have not explained why keeping them together is bad, except for the suggestion that different things should not be put together.<p>As an example of different things that should be kept together, I suggest functions and their type specification.<p>-- Objection 2 --<p>You have not stated what&#x27;s better about the Erlang approach, just that it is different. As it stands I can reverse the wording and it means largely the same thing:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nConsider &quot;time&quot;. In a non OO language &quot;time&quot; hat to be an instance of a data type. But in an OO language &quot;time&quot; is an object. For example, in <OO Language> there are lots of different varieties of time, these can be clearly and unambiguously specified using class declarations, as follows:<p><code><p>Note that these definitions do not belong to any particular data type. they are ubiquitous and objects representing times can be manipulated by any function in the system.<p>There are associated methods.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>-- Objection 3 --<p>&quot;In an OOPL data type definitions belong to objects. So I can&#x27;t find all the data type definition in one place.&quot;<p>Although I agree with you, there is the converse that in a non OO language the reverse is true. Why is one better than the other?<p>&quot;As lisp programmers have know for a long time&quot;<p>That&#x27;s an argument to authority. Why do they belive that?<p>&quot;A ubiquitous data structure is something like a linked list&quot;<p>A good number of OO fans would criticize you for saying that.<p>&quot;In an OOPL I have to choose some base object in which I will define the ubiquitous data structure, all other objects that want to use this data structure must inherit this object.&quot;<p>This is false. Although inheritance is a decidedly OO tool, it is not the be-all and end-all of OO. Have you really never seen a Java List as a member or local variable?<p>-- Objection 4 --<p>&quot;Pure declarative languages say that there is no state.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t true. What would you say a datatype is, if not state? All these languages do is separate state, not remove it.<p>&quot;The &quot;hide the state from the programmer&quot; option chosen by OOPLs is the worse possible choice.&quot;<p>Why?

However the air in the area itself is moving, so conceptually all the air is moving out of the point in the center of it. (It's not really, it's moving out of the area, but all the vectors point away from the point, so that's what it looks like.)<p>""It's true that the theorem does not require a cyclone.""<p>Thanks. That's really all I was arguing about.<p>The thing with continuous and cyclone: I was assuming, that people were saying, that the wind _always_ has to move - even if in a circle. And I was saying, no, it doesn't have to move, you can have a still area, and wind radiating out of it (or into it).<p>If I am correct about that, then please edit the wikipedia article to remove mention of cyclones.<p>Why do you say that can't happen in a 2d fluid flow? Why does it have to be a cyclone? My understanding of weather is you have a large area, you heat it up, and wind flows out of it - but there is no cyclone. (I guess with fluid flow you are assuming there is no way to manufacture fluid, but with wind you can since heat will ""create"" more of it.)<p>Tell me if I'm wrong here:<p>The hairy ball theorem assumes there is hair everywhere, so you have to have a cyclone at the poles. But with wind there are spots without hair, so the theorem just doesn't apply to wind.",1244843424

A point, by definition, has no volume.  Are you manufacturing air?<p>I think you are using some definitions that are completely at odds with what everyone else, including me, are using.  No doubt if we stood in front of a whiteboard you could make yourself clear quickly, but almost everything you have said is, according to my model of how the world works, wrong.<p>I'd like to understand you, but I suspect that's never going to happen.<p>I know the theorem - I proved a generalised version of it as a base case for a much bigger result.  I haven't bothered to read most of the comments because usually the whole thing is mis-quoted or mis-interpreted, but I just had to say something to try to understand you.<p>It's true that the theorem does not require a cyclone.  The theorem can imply a zero point with the vector field radiating from it, but in a conservative 2D fluid flow that can't happen.  In a 3D flow you can get that effect on the surface as the fluid descends to that point and then spreads, but that's different.<p>Perhaps you're responding to incorrect ""interpretations"", perhaps you're right and I just don't understand you, but you're really not making yourself clear.

First, observe that social skills can be learned the same way as anything else: by making empirical observations and performing experiments, and combining this with analysis and theory. More specifically: Actively seek out friends and opportunities for socialization and force a constant minimum level of social activity [empirical observations]. Push your boundaries and don't fear unfamiliar social situations [experiments]. Observe yourself in social situations and (dispassionately) note what you could have done better [analysis]. Read everything from pop psych self-help stuff (e.g. succeedsocially.com) to social psychology and evolutionary psychology (e.g. books and papers describing nonverbal communication and social signaling) [theory]. Learn to project confidence yet be your own worst critic. Be extremely aware of the breadth of your ignorance but don't be sheepish about what you <i>have</i> learned and done. Understand when to be a little hubristic and when to be a little deferential. These are things that we all do automatically to one degree or another, but we can all be more effective by actively observing ourselves and deliberately making adjustments.

Three space coordinates, three attitude coordinates (pitch/roll/yaw), three velocity coordinates (usually, but not always, aligned with the attitude) at a given time.  Thus we need to deal with a map from one dimension - time - to nine dimensions.  If we simplify some things, then look also at the other rates of change, we get a complex representation of non-independent variables (velocity is just rateof change of position, for example), but in the complexity of the representation, some of the behavior becomes simplified.<p>Now take clusters of these measurements and try to identify from among them which ones all correspond to the same object.  Another analogy - not what I do - is to take lots of position measurements widely spaced in time of planes in an acrobatic airshow, and try to identify the trajectories of individual 'planes.<p>Now do it all in a noisy environment with instrument error, and if you've arranged it just right, finding equal sized cuts of convex or near convex bodies can correspond to separating the plots of different objects.<p>Actually, I can get a function that lifts, supports and separates convex bodies.

It's good when it's the first step of your search process but not convenient when you want to know more from a Web page. What keywords will you select ? At Webzzle, we analyse the Web page from which you want to know more (chen you click 'explore' and send one query to Webzzle (to get Real-Time knowledge from the community) and many queries to Google in order to help you find the best results in 1 click instead of multiples keywords queries by yourself in the Google search interface.",1244840594

There is a difference, and it does matter.<p>And I would be interested to see how you can construct a non-continuous vector field from an incompressible (which air at these speeds effectively is) fluid.  Your graphic and description do not make sense - they do not allow that, macroscopically, air is a fluid.  If it travels, it has to go somewhere.  It can't simply stop at a boundary, it has to change direction, and such changes of direction cannot be instantaneous.  This is why in electronics we need to deal with signal reflection, over-voltages, and similar phenomena.<p>Additionally, continuous technically does not mean ""no large jumps"", although that's how the technical definition was inspired, and how most people visualise it. In particular, it's possible to create a function that's continuous at every irrational, and discontinuous at every rational.<p>It's certainly true that the theorem is dealing with a theoretical approximation to a messy, physical situation, but broadly speaking it's applicable.  It says that at the Earth's surface there is always at least one place where the horizontal component of the air movement (wind velocity) is zero.  Errors are often made when trying to make folksey explanations, and it's the interpretations that often have errors.  The theorem is true, applicable and in some cases, useful.",1244840422

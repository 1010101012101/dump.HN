(The Medical Hypotheses blog is associated with the journal Medical Hypotheses, edited by the same person who posted the blog post I link above, and he runs the journal, and evidently the blog as well, to post ideas of his own that cannot obtain peer-reviewed publication elsewhere.) I have read several of the articles and reviews he cites in this submitted blog post, and most have nothing to do with what he is writing about in the blog article, but are simply there to pad his reference list.<p>But I must, for completeness of response, mention that the book<p>N.J.

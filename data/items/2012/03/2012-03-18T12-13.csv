One of the things that came up most about hated software was that it had a high frustration level<p>Who's ever wished for a giant red ""PLEASE STOP HELPING ME"" button on their computer? Everyone, right? One of the causes of frustration we looked at was when the software helps you, but gets it wrong. Frustration is increased when the effort to fix the software's ""help"" is anything other than minor, and increased again when the computer repeats it's efforts at helping. Throw in no obvious way to get it to stop and you're in for some blood-boiling times.<p>The guideline we came up with was to not concentrate so much on how cool it is when things go well, but think about what happens when the software guesses user intent incorrectly. Consider:<p>* How often is the software likely to get it wrong?<p>* what was the level of irritation is caused by getting it wrong?<p>* How much effort is required to undo the computer's help?<p>and weight it up against how much effort you're saving the user when you get it right.<p>Thinking about this has caused us not to add a particular cool feature we had planned, because even though (we thought) it was very cool, there was about 30% chance or so of it being wrong, and the payoff wasn't worth it.",1332074868

Explains so much...<p><i>In the neighboring programming-language kingdoms, taking out the trash is a straightforward affair, very similar to the way we described it in English up above. As is the case in Java, data objects are nouns, and functions are verbs. But unlike in Javaland, citizens of other kingdoms may mix and match nouns and verbs however they please, in whatever way makes sense for conducting their business.<p>For instance, in the neighboring realms of C-land, JavaScript-land, Perl-land and Ruby-land, someone might model taking out the garbage as a series of actions  that is to say, verbs, or functions. Then if they apply the actions to the appropriate objects, in the appropriate order (get the trash, carry it outside, dump it in the can, etc.), the garbage-disposal task will complete successfully, with no superfluous escorts or chaperones required for any of the steps.<p>There's rarely any need in these kingdoms to create wrapper nouns to swaddle the verbs. They don't have GarbageDisposalStrategy nouns, nor GarbageDisposalDestinationLocator nouns for finding your way to the garage, nor PostGarbageActionCallback nouns for putting you back on your couch. They just write the verbs to operate on the nouns lying around, and then have a master verb, take_out_garbage(), that springs the subtasks to action in just the right order.</i>",1332074569

'cookies' were lambasted as the embodiment of evil in the mid-late 90's.  The hysteria around them was insane.  Why?  We had little control over the visibility of what a cookie was, what it said, and how to manage them.  Even today, in 2012, cookies are little understood, and to 'manager' them requires multiple clicks in to layers of menus often marked 'advanced' or 'privacy' (both are silly labels for cookie data, imo).  We could have given people easier access to view/manage/understand cookie data, and probably avoided national legislation like we see in some countries now, but that would have meant breaking the status quo.

After financing in both cases they own less than %100 of the stock.  The company can sell stock and dilute the founders, which often makes economic sense.  Or the company can sell stock and dilute the founders while the founders also sell some stock and turn it into cash.<p>The main argument for founders not being able to sell stock seems to be to keep the founders broke and thus more desperate to take investor terms.<p>I also think that all money is the same. $100k in sweat equity should be at least as valuable (if not more) than $100k in cash on loan from some teachers pension fund.  Thus  no liquidation preferences for investors or other special rights.  You want my ownership which came from sweat to now suddenly start vesting?  Fine, the shares you just bought with cash, start vesting too on the same schedule.<p>If anyone should have preferences, its those who put in the sweat, not the people who convinced a pension manager to let them invest their money.<p>Companies that are internet based don't need nearly as much money these days as they did in the past, meanwhile there's a lot of money chasing startups.  Its about time that the terms got more equitable.",1332073377

It is my job to gather facts and report them as accurately as possible and let you decide.""<p>I feel like that is one of the most important ethics missing from so much of journalism today.

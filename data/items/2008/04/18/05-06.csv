So I try to get up early and work non stop for as many hours as I can, I find I am most fresh and productive before I get in contact with the ""outside world"".",1208497844

167006,comment,166905,166905,0,0,agentbleu,,,"Your not a machine. Hacking is hard, it taxes us like not many other jobs. I read here a long post about sleep problems, hackers get all excited whenever the sleep topic comes up (seems many suffer). The point is hacking too late into the night can upset my sleep, thus starting a vicious cycle. I'd suggest stepping back, don't push too hard, if your working during the day then maybe hack for yourself at the weekends of for only 1.30 a day.",1208497684

167002,comment,166990,166990,0,0,kyro,,,"Nice job. That's new startup #2 today (chompchompdead.com) - which is definitely motivating.<p>My only criticisms are: Really cut down on that huge red banner at the top. I think most of it is dead space, and one thing that annoys me is having to scroll down on a home page just to see the content. What you can do is move that red banner towards the center and segment it into 'read,' 'write,' 'rate,' to explain the site and have your big 'sign up' button underneath. Also, you might want to jazz up the nav bar seeing everything else seems nicely polished. I think your description of the purpose of the site is a bit confusing and not as direct as it should be, personally. I had a bit of a hard time understanding it. Maybe you should have the login form right on the front page, extra clicks are tedious.<p>The color palette is pretty soothing and nice to look at. The only thing I might change is to maaaaybe somehow differentiate the ads on the side from the main content of the site.<p>It'd be cool if you used cafepress or any other service to physically publish the book when it is complete and give those who made it in the book a cut of the book sales, but that's definitely not a primary concern.<p>Congrats on launch. Sounds cool.",1208497210

I don't know how it works either, but it does.<p>Martial arts training is good, too.  Classes are at a specific time (which can be good and bad) and it's much more social (which is almost entirely good).",1208495804

166992,comment,166905,166905,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"I have two points to make here:<p>1. Your general mood - I don't think you can control it and so you might be better off going along with it rather than trying to fight it. I also work on my stuff part time, and many days I sit down with the intention of doing something and I realize that I just can't do a damned thing. Forcing yourself to do stuff at this point is likely to make you unhappy and produce no code, so it's kinda useless.<p>I don't know about you, but I don't know when exactly I am in the good/bad mood, so I sit down and try to get some work done. Some nights I end up working 6+hrs straight into the wee hours and other nights I close down the editor and play CS or watch TV.<p>2. When you're working on new stuff sometimes its hard to get started since there may be several ways to do it, and they all seem equally valid. Instead of trying to plan out too much, just start implementing one of them. Even if you chose wrongly (you can reverse it later), it'll both motivate you to work further and give you a much better idea of what it is that you actually want/need to do.<p>I tend to do a good amount this kind of programming and it works out well in the end (if I compare some of earlier check-ins for my current project with the latest ones, there'll be very very little in common)<p>As awesome as the Hacker's Diet is (I use EMA weight chart to keep track of my weight), I don't think you'll find something quite like that for emotions ;)",1208495278

After looking around we found that there wasn't much choice on the net, so we decided to create a site - http://www.fictionthis.com<p>It is currently in beta at the moment and we are in the process of selecting the opening verse of the book. I would really appreciate your feedback.<p>http://www.fictionthis.com/",1208495229

They are more motivated to than children to pursue good grades and they have money.<p>- Charge more. If you lose users, so what? You've only lost the ones that you can't make money from in the first place. (although I see that you've raised the price already).<p>- Your wife doesn't sound committed. No selling the thing (migrate to a new domain now to get rid of the name association, what's the problem?), no charging more out of fear, fear of losing control. If it's a hobby for her, and you want it to be more, you have a problem. Solve this first.<p>- Find subject experts on a profit-sharing basis if you don't want to invest any money (although seriously at your age and your household makeup, 5000 euros should not be a major problem and it would get you sufficient content for 5 different subjects).<p>- If you will work 4 days after your baby is born, you'll have even less time than you have now to work on this! This one day will be full-time babysitting unless you take her to day care, which I presume you'll only do for 3 days a week!<p>- The way your website is structured, it doesn't seem to be easy to expand into different subjects.<p>- The 'original' website (with the free content) looks like a 1997 Geocities page. It also doesn't make many attempts at upselling, apart from some small links to the premium version.<p>- Have you tried calling schools, or the associations your wife is a member of? If she uses it, ask her colleagues why they don't. Then fix those issues.",1300453160

I live on pretty solid ground away from active fault lines. If one of our minor fault lines ever acted up, I could certainly imagine the kind of motion you mention. But if my property ""cracked,"" I'd expect to <i>feel</i> the swaying motion and that each piece of my yard would move in the same direction preventing me <i>seeing</i> the motion. On further consideration that the park in the video is built on a former bay, I supposed the quake could be making the dirt float around on the mushy underside.<p>The first thing I noticed was an oddness about the crack in the sidewalk. It seems to have cracked perfectly along some crack line that's outside of the sidewalk (not likely - just because dirt cracks underneath doesn't mean the concrete will crack exactly where the dirt does) and there seems to be some rubbery surface where the crack ends in the sidewalk (it stretches as the parts of earth move in different directions.)

It will only be a matter of time before S3 disks and hardware start dying like EBS...en masse<p>I talked with Ketralnis several year ago and know how many VMs you were running back then. Pretty sure your not too far off from that count even today (even if 2x).<p>You can still virtualize on a good set of dedicated hardware to emulate your current 'network environment' to get you up and running in the near term _asap_. Obviously you'd build out of that vm environment (with your load) as the days go by. Seriously look into a parallel switch over though.<p>If EBS is in fact a huge issue as has been shown, you really may need to start migrating off unless you want dedicated employees monitoring system health on AWS. Eventually if problems continue that is what will happen, with no time left to even develop automation... And why automate on a pile of instability?<p>Don't forget that the more VMs you add with this high failure rate increases soft management costs and will eventually eat into your development time...<p>I don't work for Rackspace (I think they're quite expensive), but you guys might benefit from this level of care to focus on the real issues.",1300452676

As someone who has invested heavily in implementing HA systems and then seen them be the root of increased downtime, I have come to the same conclusion.  A simple fail-over system that will result in short downtime & require limited manual intervention is in many cases the best route.",1300452663

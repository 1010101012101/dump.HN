You can still buy non-GMO seeds""<p>Traditionally farmers would save a portion of their crop to plant for the next year.  There is even a special machine that prepares seed for planting called a ""seed cleaner"".  Enter patented GMO seed which gets planted in a field next to  regular seed and is cross pollinated by nature.  Now the farmer who didn't plant GMO seed has a crop that contains the GMO patented gene.  So if he cleans that seed he is at risk of being sued the next year for patent infringement by monsanto.  In fact they have been systematically been suing seed cleaners to to get their client lists and then sue the farmers.  Since it is nearly impossible to ensure your crop hasn't been cross pollinated with a GMO crop Monsanto has essentially shut down the traditional way farmers have worked.  additionally they are reportedly <i>very</i> aggressive in pursuing farmers and frequently trespass on their fields to take seed samples.  That is why they say that they have ""ruined"" family farming.<p>Food Inc. is one good documentary where this is discussed in detail among other food related issues.<p><a href=""http://www.slowfoodsanfrancisco.com/blog/policy/monsanto-destroying-farming-communities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slowfoodsanfrancisco.com/blog/policy/monsanto-des...</a>",1360508367

There is no question that the Obama justice department has convened an active grand jury to investigate whether WikiLeaks violated the draconian Espionage Act of 1917.

The greater the difference in two armies technologies, the more pronounced the tactical advantage is.  The Taliban did not see anything resembling a victory when the US attacked Afghanistan; they survive now by hiding in caves, and their overall strategy is based on intimidating civilians.<p>If you want to point to a case where superior technology did not result in victory, you should have pointed to Nazi Germany.

By enabling CI or CD one can remove the major impediment to remote working - managers cannot see what you have done in a day.<p>If folks remote work in the software department, pretty soon others want to.  The company needs to have the same confidence that people are working and things progressing daily.  So let's say marketing moves to the technicalmarketing beloved of patio11 - you can have Market department run tests on it's changes, measure customer behaviour etc.  And they don't need to do it in the office.<p>Apply the same to every business process.  Business people need to interact so we are not going to abandon cities - but the most valuable interactions are inter-company not intra-company.<p>So from little acorns of CI we can see the world of the Race against the Machine coming to pass - White collar workers automated or their jobs changed out of recognition.<p>So my startup, yeah that.

If you live in a country that makes payments difficult, what do you expect a blogging platform to do about it? You'll encounter the same issue from any ad network who might pay you to put ads on your own unaffiliated blog. If you want that fixed you have to lobby your government to fix it, or move to another country.<p>In addition to that, Paypal has to deal with an army of international scammers and Paypal are cheap/lazy bastards who would rather screw over their users than devise elegant solutions to those problems. But almost all of those problems are a result of Paypal withdrawing money from one account and depositing it into another. A blogging platform doesn't do that: They get money from advertisers, who are happy when their ads are shown to users who buy stuff regardless of the are-you-a-dog status of individual bloggers, and deposit the money into the accounts that said bloggers have asked it to be deposited into. There is nowhere near the same opportunity to steal anyone else's money in the traditional method of signing up for a scam account and taking payments for goods or services you never intend to deliver, so the level of dickishness required to run the operation is substantially reduced.",1360507326

Sure, recruiters also exaggerate how good some positions are, claim advertised jobs are filled and offer alternatives you're not interested in or suitable for, but employers do that too. Recruiters don't have a great reputation, but that's more down to them being expensive for employers and annoyingly persistent than dangerously immoral.<p>There probably aren't any legal issues with sticking up a fake CV if you get hired on the basis of a real one, but rest assured it's not going to look good with employers if she applies for positions they haven't got round to advertising yet or if they end up with a copy of two suspiciously similar CVs with similar names, or if it turns out the third party recruiter is actually being retained to do the initial screening interview (it happens!)<p>If she's worried about having her passport photocopied she doesn't sound savvy enough to be doing what the recruiter will consider to be cheating them out of commission, and even an employer that's quietly pleased not to be paying commissions will worry about dishonesty if she gets found out.",1360506697

These people plan to transfer to a 4 year college after getting an associate's degree. Others didn't do so well in high school and want additional remedial courses before going to a 4 year college. In many states, it's easy to transfer from a CC to a 4 year state college, because the additional work needed for an AA degree is more meaningful than the work to graduate from high school.<p>For example, ""The regents of the University of California report that 30 percent of UC graduates attended a community college before transferring to the UC.""<p>Yes, as you say, CC is also for career education. It's also for non-credit/continuing education. I took several CC classes in the latter category.<p>And the comparison of OKCCC to your alma mater is almost useless. Better would be to compare to Oklahoma State where it's $147.50/credit hour. (There's another roughly $110/credit hour in ""fees"". For an arts&sciences degree, the overall cost is about $275/credit hour. For OKCCC it's $99/credit hour, including fees.)<p>The ""corner cutting"" doesn't need to be in the education. The mandatory fees for OSU include ""student union renovation"", ""campus recreation"", ""Academic Excellence"", ""Library Automation & Technology"", ""Life Safety & Security"", and others. Since many people go to a CC because it's local, they are less likely to spend time in the student union or in on-campus recreation so the corresponding fees are smaller. The library at a CC is likely smaller, and less in need of automation.<p>Also, the lab equipment for a two year program doesn't need to be as advanced. My 4 year college upper-level physics lab had microwave generators, an x-ray crystallography machine, and a radiation source. Why should a CC also have them?<p>These aren't cutting corners, these are inappropriate expenses for the goal of the students and the school.<p>That said, a CC program isn't going to have tenured research professors in a field teaching an introduction course, and won't have the fellowship/intern programs in place, or foreign exchange programs. These can (indirectly) affect the quality of education.<p>But to say that these are all cut corners is to idealize what an education must be.",1360505607

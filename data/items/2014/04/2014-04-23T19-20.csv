I agree learning to write code is only half the challenge, dealing with constraints like capacity, users, deadlines, hosting, stubborn colleagues, unsolvable problems it&#x27;s easy to work-round or ignore with theoretical exercises. You only get those in a real-world job or real-world volunteer effort. The student may also find a mentor there.",1398283189
7636530,comment,7635107,7635107,5,0,otterley,,,"My experience with renewing my Internet subscription recently is that cable providers are offering significant incentives to customers to add subscriptions to at least some form of TV service in addition to Internet service.<p>I&#x27;m a Comcast customer in the SF Bay Area.  Six months ago I only had Internet service; no TV.  I called customer service in search of a better deal, and it turned out I could lower my total bill by adding TV service!  In other words, Internet alone is now more expensive than Internet + TV.  So they&#x27;re now /subsidizing/ TV service (or at least discounting Internet service) to inflate their TV subscriber count.<p>Are others having similar experiences?",1398283182

There&#x27;s relatively little benefit to be gained from using an architecture other than amd64 or ARM at this point; silicon has evolved to the point were the line between RISC and CISC is pretty much nonexistent, save for some minor benefits around code density etc. The benefits of using amd64 are beyond-compare experience of optimisation, commodity pricing, and legacy compatibility; the costs are negligible.<p>However, I&#x27;m somewhat uncomfortable with Intel&#x27;s increasing and complete near-domination of the &quot;not-low-power&quot; CPU market. I&#x27;d love to see other high-end silicon designers start to develop amd64-compatible processors that will encourage competition in the market.

It&#x27;s a violation of separation of concerns and a disrespect for the software developer&#x27;s domain expertise.<p>The trend I have seen in enterprise software is that, because good software developers are expensive and in high demand, the business attempts to commoditize them by having lower paid, semi-technical staff (like business analysts) do everything except for write the actual code, limiting the developer&#x27;s job description to simply translating a diagram and a list of features and business rules into Java--like some sort of human compiler.<p>That approach is doomed to produce terrible software forever, because you can&#x27;t write good software without thinking deeply and understanding both the problem to be solved and the tools available to solve it. And you just can&#x27;t commoditize a job that requires that much thinking.<p>On the other hand, I do agree that software development needs to be made easier than it currently is. It is currently very hard because the current tools we have are built on layers upon layers of leaky abstractions that still require a highly trained and experienced individual to understand first, in order to be productive.

Most connections, and connections are what matters here, not total traffic, are going to have a port 80 or 443 on one side of the connection or the other.  So while I think 12 bits is too low, in practical use, you aren&#x27;t getting the 32 bits you think you are getting.   Considering source port restrictions, I think saying single-level nat extends IPv4 with another 16 bits is not too far off.

War, inequality, charity, abuse, politeness, castes, genocide - they are all just displays of dominance and submission.<p>Hypocrisy is not required for something to be zero-sum, but it is a common symptom. I said it was evidence, not proof. Zero-sum games always require a winner and loser and therefore a double standard - what is good for one is not good for the other. It&#x27;s a stretch, I know. It&#x27;s probably too weak to make a good case for.<p>I don&#x27;t think my argument is a straw man - I do believe that there is inherent inequality (and therefore hierarchical jockeying) when one moves from the treatment like oneself in the golden rule to the &quot;special treatment&quot; of the platinum rule. Again, I can&#x27;t think of a way to make a strong case for it at this time.<p>I vehemently disagree with your claim that it is simple to stop this policy if it is clear a person is abusing it.

Plain vanilla energy deficit. Not enough energy. Babies die within the first days after birth.\nor\n2. Inefficient - but normal - energy production. This will produce an excess of free radicals, &quot;emitting&quot; all kinds of weird signals to the rest of the cell/tissue/body. Most of mitochondrial diseases and diseases that cause a secondary mitochondrial dysfunction fall in this category. &quot;The threshold effect&quot; - mutant mitochondria outnumber healthy mitochondria as you grow older - will eventually take you to point 1.<p>Given this, repairing the mitochondria will bring homeostasis back. Currently, there are 3 lines of thought:\n1. Repair the faulty mitochondria\n2. Allotopic expression (literally, make backup copies of mitochondria DNA in the nuclear DNA and let them &quot;express&quot; from here instead of from mtDNA)\n3. Kill faulty mitochondria. Given that mitochondria go through a fusion/fission cycles every few days, killing faulty mitochondria will restore a healthy mitochondria population in a very short period. The underlying genetic defect is still there, but it causes no harm at all.<p>I am for 3.; much simpler both technically and legally.

The system, called Dual Elliptic Curve, was a random number generator, but it had a deliberate flaw - or &quot;back door&quot; - that allowed the NSA to crack the encryption.</i><p><i>A group of professors from Johns Hopkins, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Illinois and elsewhere now say they have discovered that a second NSA tool exacerbated the RSA software&#x27;s vulnerability</i><p>Even more importantly, RSA did not issue a denial (though I concede that they may have later on, I just haven&#x27;t googled it yet)...they refused to comment even on the possibility that the NSA made a payment to them regarding the controversial issue.<p>> <i>We could have been more skeptical of NSA&#x27;s intentions,&quot; RSA Chief Technologist Sam Curry told Reuters. &quot;We trusted them because they are charged with security for the U.S. government and U.S. critical infrastructure.&quot;</i><p><i>Curry declined to say if the government had paid RSA to incorporate Extended Random in its BSafe security kit, which also housed Dual Elliptic Curve.</i><p>This is quite different than Github.

There&#x27;s no real value in being able to do:<p><pre><code>  Foo:  ValueBegin (this is a comment)\n    ValueEnds\n</code></pre>\nVersus requiring Foo: ValueBegin ValueEnds<p>As far as performance, I must say you&#x27;re incorrect. Review the nginx HTTP parser and you&#x27;ll see all sorts of bitwise hacks in order to improve performance. This aligns with my own experience writing a packet capture system for a similar protocol.<p>Having open syntax, comments and line folding being part of the problem, incredibly complicates the parser. Other moronic things are the completely arbitrary handling of header fields. Some header fields allow their <i>value</i> to be split over multiple lines but must treat it as if it was one line. Others use multiple headers to provide some multi-line value. There&#x27;s no simple parsing, it all must be sensitive to the context. This is just stupid, yet free-text protocol authors revel in it. SIP even publishes a &quot;torture test&quot; RFC where they&#x27;re just oh-so-pleased with the edge cases their moronic spec allows. They even suggest a parser should guess as to the message sender&#x27;s intent.<p>I&#x27;d also note that in some cases the parser is most of the stack (simple proxy scenarios, frontend security). Regardless, the fact that the rest of the stack may be complicated is not in any way an excuse for making the parser worse. This is not a programming language.",1398280979

There are plenty of men who behave like this aren&#x27;t there? And my experience has been that both men and women don&#x27;t like men doing it?<p>So it seems that either a woman doing it is doubly bad (which seems like a form of sexism - you can&#x27;t even be obnoxious if you&#x27;re a woman because it&#x27;s distinctively obnoxious) or it isn&#x27;t really a gender issue.<p>I&#x27;m not intending to pointlessly nit pick here.

I&#x27;ve had friends who sell it (not in a &quot;I became friends with a dealer&quot; way, but just people who I found out deal unrelated to how I knew them), and there is a <i>lot</i> of money to be made there, even selling fairly small quantities. It&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve had a conversation on this topic, but afaik it&#x27;s still the case, even with people who sell to a few dozen people, mostly small quantities, can make a hell of a living from it.<p>All that said, it&#x27;s possible my knowledge is from a fairly affluent middle class angle (hell, the last person I met who randomly turned out to be a coke dealer was somebody who held a decent job in the PC hardware industry, though he&#x27;s stopped dealing now).<p>Would love to know more about the economies involved (for example I&#x27;ve heard rough numbers of cost for cocaine from its origin in South America to UK consumers, but not in huge detail), but it&#x27;s very hard to find out this sort of information without being directly involved yourself.",1398280173

The Jubilee is a better idea, but to prevent a total collapse of the banking system, you could structure it differently, like making all debts voluntary.  Basically our society has been trending towards this (with currently the exception of educational debts) and so what we are seeing is that people with good credit that don&#x27;t spend their line of credit boozing through their twenties being highly valued.  But because lending from individuals is becoming tapped out as their credit is wasted, a lot of debts have become shifted to the public, in the form of municipal, state, and federal debt - sometimes through public spending and sometimes by explicitly converting private debt into public debt.",1398280130

There are a few odd ducks that opt to be in contexts where social norms are not to their liking. The vast majority of people go where they feel comfortable. The main point has to do with consensuality, so for most psychologically normal people, an honest account will support my point.<p>I can understand, though, if someone finds my mention of The Castro somewhat &quot;othering.&quot; The othering wasn&#x27;t my intention. It was a <i>gedankenexperiment</i> about being outside norms that support one&#x27;s chosen boundaries. There are also a whole panoply of unspoken social norms and power relationships that change and come into play as well. Only holistic experiences, actual or imagined, are efficient for communicating these.",1398279735

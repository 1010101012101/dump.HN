I don't think microsoft has the patience to do it any other way. <p>Also it's now becoming clear why microsoft was never interested in putting support for SVG in IE.",1178094954

It's not enough that pirates steal, but they have to publicize their behavior and tactics and encourage others to follow them. It's this type of publicity that fools people into thinking that somehow digital piracy isn't equivalent to walking into Best Buy and shoplifting. <p>I can only hope that one day these characters get caught and have to face the MPAA in court.

I agree that it's extremely premature for anyone to say something like ""Silverlight will be the platform of choice for developers who build rich Internet applications"", but it would not surprise me if Silverlight gains wide adoption (as long as it truly is as cross-platform as Microsoft claims).<p>Of course, it's possible that the APIs and development tools suck despite all the hoopla and good features.

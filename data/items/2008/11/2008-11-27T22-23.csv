Also, he has something of a reality distortion field...",1227826754

It's made me appreciate his attitude a lot more.<p>In particular, his criticism for how the press handled Twilight. I lost my love for newspapers through 2006-2007 with their handling of the book series. If you haven't read them, the books are <i>disgustingly</i> bad; high schoolers have a better track record in terms of quality. And newspapers and ""old media"" never once referred to it. They'd focus only on the popularity and on the many people who liked it, which was a really self-serving story.<p>I really hope people start speaking up against that sort of news reporting. It's killing the news. And I think that old news is going to end up dead as the Internet gains prominent, but god - what an ugly death.",1227826448

378951,comment,378681,378895,0,0,jerf,,,"I don't know what these ""three ways"" are, but the GPL in general will not cross a process boundary. As long as you talk to it cross-process, you're safe from the point of view of combining code. You're even ""safer"" if you're talking across servers. (Scare quoted because you're basically 100% safe either way.) Other clauses may need to be respected as well but they tend not to be onerous.<p>Obviously, with sufficient effort, you can do anything across a process boundary, it's just inconvenient, and you have to at least share all the changes you made on the GPL side.",1227825772

378948,comment,378900,378900,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I think your idea is doomed, even if you achieve technical nirvana in email delivery. Here's why:<p>1. You will not beat MS in the exchange market. ""Everyone"" uses office, therefore everyone has the outlook client, it's a short hop to installing Exchange, and it can scale right up to enterprise size adequately enough that you'll never be able to touch it. You can see how IBM and Novell have both been destroyed in this market if you're interested in the battle you face.<p>EDIT: Corporations will not even talk to you, because honestly, email is a problem that is already solved for 99% of them. Additionally, if they're big, it is much easier for them to just go with the flow and use the common system - no one ever got fired for buying IBM, and no one ever got fired for using exchange. Look at Symantec, many people have them beat in the AV game, but they own the mid level market.<p>2. On the startup end, you're competing with free software and hosted solutions. If startups aren't comfortable with gmail or similar, odds are they just stick with their domain host's offering and use the local client of their choice.<p>I suppose there could be a very real market for a hosted email service that gives the flexibility of gmail with the comfort of a paid, secure service. I think though that it would be very difficult to firstly find this market, and second present an offering that is tempting enough for them to switch.<p>Honestly, don't waste your time on this one... the work required just to meet the minimum expectations is so vast it isn't worth it.",1227825391

378938,comment,378424,378424,0,0,mathogre,,,"Two things:  lots of risk and the O'Reilly book, ""Learning Python.""<p>I work for a company and was running a research project in air traffic control worth ~$400K.  I was the principal investigator.  We were going to create a tool that would redesign the airspace boundaries managed by a controller or controller team.  At the time, I programmed in C, Awk, and a little Perl.  I'd used Python at the command line, but had never programmed in it.  I knew however it was the language we needed.  I committed to it, and my partner agreed to it.  We both learned Python on our own and the project succeeded.  It had to succeed.  If it didn't, we were in lots of trouble.  We had company VPs watching us.<p>The Learning Python book is superior to the Programming Python book.  While both are written with the same author, the Learning book is far more readable.<p>My favorite ongoing resource today is the documentation that comes with Python.  I have a copy of it installed on the Linux box at work, and on my Macs at home.  It is hands-down the best quick reference for the language.",1227823635

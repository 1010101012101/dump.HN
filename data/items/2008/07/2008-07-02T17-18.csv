Corporate - pays the market rate but will not assume the legal risk of taking on individual developers; will only work with another corporation or agency.<p>2. Mom & pop - will work with individual developers but only on a fixed bid; expectations are about a quarter of realistic budget.<p>So my choices as a freelancer are: work 8-hour days and get paid my full rate through a recruiter (yes, they skim off the top but who cares, my rates are what they are), or work long days + weekends on freelance projects and get paid pennies on the dollar (both in terms of lower hourly rates and never getting paid for all the hours you work).<p>Add to that the tax benefit from maintaining a home office, and you realize that there is simply no reason not to work through an agency/recruiter.

Many places, like Robert-Half, don't have coders on staff, so there's no capital expenditures when the market is slow. A large firm would still have to pay people. Now, an example would be IBM, they're a huge development shop if you think about it, but they have many contacts and work on long projects that consistently bring in revenue. Its hard to get to that level, especially when your clients are diverse and hire you for one-off projects.<p>In your example about law firms, I think its inaccurate to say there are no large nationwide firms. Its more accurate to say there are few large nationwide plaintiff's firms (although lawyers have other restrictions we won't get into). Plaintiff firm's clients don't usually come back for a second round, which makes it hard to employ many people who might just sit around doing nothing. Business law firms, on the other hand, do have large nationwide presences, because their work is often on retainer or consistent.<p>I think you're right that the market is against the structure of a large firm.

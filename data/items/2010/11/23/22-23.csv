1935736,comment,1935441,1935441,0,0,yoak,,,"I really appreciate this article.  Unimaginably, most programmers I interview to this day in late 2010, react primarily to number of shares an offer includes option to buy.  I've written offers with (made up numbers) option to purchase 10,000 shares at a strike price of $0.10 and had candidates, asking no questions, attempt to negotiate for 20,000 shares which is something that they'd be more comfortable with.<p>In my admittedly limited experience, just realizing that there are a number of shares out there (fully diluted or not!) and that this grant translates to a percentage of the company and that the strike price implies a valuation is beyond a solid majority of people I've seen receive stock option grants.  Articles like this one are certainly needed to improve education on these matters.",1290553165

I just think it's the employer's problem in this case, not the employee's.<p>> Do you agree that the distinction between personal and company is vague and human defined?<p>No. The argument made by many people disagreeing with me in this discussion is predicated on the employee downloading data from the company Exchange system. That provides an objective standard for what constitutes ""company data"".<p>If you're going to try to broaden that in some ill-defined way to any other data the employee has, you might as well argue that any employer should have the right to audit any and all of an employee's personal property, communications or brainwaves. I am aware that some employers actually do seem to think that at least the first two are reasonable, but I vehemently disagree with them, and so does the law in most places.<p>> What kind of high-end security hardware are you talking about?<p>The relevant ones here typically record/block/modify network traffic: intrusion detection, data leakage prevention, lawful intercept, that kind of thing.<p>> If you used an advanced Cisco software VPN client, you could (so I hear) have it scan the client computer and enforce policies on it.

As I keep saying, if the company requires that kind of control, it should be issuing employees with dedicated systems at company expense, configured appropriately.

Valuations are at least somehow tethered to sales, and companies that justify mid- 9-figure exits can usually consider IPO... as an example of how rare that event is.<p>* In most sectors of the industry there are rule-of-thumb valuations based on multiples on sales. An enterprise software company aiming for a $150MM acquisition is expecting 4-8x, and needs to be achieving 18MM (optimistically) to 40MM (conservatively) sales to do that. You can reconcile this estimate by asking for current sales, this year's ""number"" (in a well-run company, everyone knows the number), and then asking ""what's going to happen to scale the number up"".<p>* Last time I had to think pragmatically about VC, a round that took participating preferred shares (in which the VC takes their money off the table, <i>then</i> takes their percentage off the table) was an indication of a weak round; if they're shooting for the moon, you're entitled to hold that against them.<p>* Finally, remember that <i>if you quit, the equation changes again</i>. When you leave, you can execute your vested options, but that costs money. Perhaps nobody in the company is less protected than <i>former employees</i>: investors have contractual provisions to protect their money, and employees are given retention grants, but former employees can be written right out of the deal.

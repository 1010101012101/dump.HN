For instance you don't have to worry about hackers taking passwords from you any more. At worst they bust in and take a list of functional email addresses (assuming you email users) and site settings (which may our may not be valuable, depending on your site.)<p>Maybe I did a shit job of explaining my concern. Or maybe I'm further off base than I think?",1309690751

For example, when writing a toy high-performance memory allocator for a university class, I was able to gain a significant[1] performance boost by replacing __attribute__((packed)) structs with pointer arithmetic #defines for the allocation block descriptors, with an identical memory layout.<p>[1] I don't remember the exact gain, but it was at least 10%.",1309690749
2723481,comment,2721621,2722917,1,0,Daniel14,,,"Sorry for not specifying that, thanks for the correction. The exception to promoting being legal of course is, when the product in question has a monopoly on the market. However, I doubt that's the case with Google Search. Again, IANAL, but a) the barriers to enter the industry are pretty small, b) there are plenty of alternatives, c) you can switch to them extremely easy, and d) Google would go out of business if they tried raising prices (i.e., they don't control the market).<p>Also, my point still stands - Google has been promoting other products on their homepage for a long time without getting sued. I don't understand how Plus would be different from, say, Reader.",1309690711
2723480,comment,2723089,2723359,3,0,dsl,,,"You are confusing checksums with signatures. BitTorrent only verifies that I have a bit for bit copy of the file the torrent was created from, not that the file is an unaltered version of what the author originally released. Additionally, the modern internet no longer needs mechanisms to deal with download corruption beoynd TCP checksums, BitTorrent implements recovery from failed blocks to protect you from a ""flaw"" of the protocol itself (you can't always trust the origin of the bits).<p>BitTorrent is also overly inefficient as a download protocol. It only makes sense in situations where you have extremely large flash crowds (WoW for example sending multiple GB to 14 million players in a few days) or the original source isn't in a position (legally or technologically) to source more than a few downloads.<p>The final nail in the coffin is the fact that a few major CDNs tried peer-to-peer for content delivery. The major broadband ISPs were none too pleased with their last-mile infrastructure (the most expensive part to deploy mind you) being abused. Their networks were designed for consumption, not distribution.",1309690524

CBC encrypted data has a 'flat' histogram, where as structured data has a different signature.<p>Create a program that creates data histograms and you'll see what I mean. There are much easier ways to tell as well, like FOURCC or magic bits for files, for instance a gif file always starts with GIF89, or JPEGs start with JFIF, same with zip files, tar, etc. Almost every file can be recognized independently of it's name, by it's structure.<p>If you reverse engineer stuff sometimes you'll be given files that you don't even know the structure of and have to figure out what are offsets and what is data.

This allows multiple parties to edit a graph concurrently and later to merge their changes.<p>GitGraph also enables partitioning of a graph into functional hierarchies, and to combine graphs in a tree-like fashion.  For example, if you have a graph with information about cities, and another with information about people, you can place the two graph directories side by side in a parent directory and load this as a single graph.  You can create new vertices and edges, at the parent level, which connect people and cities, and then you can save the whole thing and check it in to Git.  Another developer can then check out your work and either load the whole graph or, if he is only interested in either cities or people, one of the subdirectories.<p>Even if he only loads the graph about cities, he can make local changes to it and push them back to you without invalidating the top-level graph"".<p>See this discussion on the Gremlin Users group (<a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gremlin-users/trBKdAW105U/qBfckF0bOiIJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gremlin-users/trBKdAW105U/qB...</a>).",1309689359

2723459,comment,2722730,2722730,2,0,frsyuki,,,"Interesting. OMeta can create a new parser that inherits from an existing parser. It's unique.
But we have to not just parse but also evaluate. OMeta's external DSL is excellent for parsing but seems difficult to use for evaluating.<p>There are other parser libraries based on PEG such as pyPEG (Python), LPeg (Lua) or Parsec (Haskell). They use internal DSL rather than external DSL. I have used Parslet (Ruby) in my project and it's worth to try.

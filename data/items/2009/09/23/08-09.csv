I'd have a school administrator page or portal or something target at people who purchase 30 accounts at once.<p>But you need an entry point. Cold calling schools is likely ineffective. Try seeing which schools use Blackboard and then see if you can convince someone to try it out Eduset. Administrators are definitely looking to cut costs where they can. If you can provide their current LMS functionality for cheaper, there might be a play there.<p>Another thing to try is once you have users, suggest that they tell their friends about it. Maybe suggest it on a newsletter? Make it easy for them to share it with their peers and even their administrator.<p>This is probably a revenue model decision for you. The way I see it, 60 bucks a year is not much. If the teacher cares enough, then they should be willing to spend it. 60 bucks is not painful enough for them to push the school to pay for it. If it were more money, you'd lose teachers because they weren't willing to try it but you may net a whole school. A way you maybe able to solve this is offer some really expensive but cool tool at a higher pricing point. Base is 60 bucks but if you want to be able to track how students/classes/races are doing it's going to be 800 (maybe more?) bucks a class. Okay that idea was from a quick brainstorm, administrators love numbers... especially ones they can show accountability to parents with.",1253696386

It makes no sense for me to quit my job and code when there are great coders out there who I can outsource to(/partner with) and keep the strain off the company finances.

838889,comment,838806,838881,0,0,jmtame,,,"after thinking about it a bit more, and from my experience in yc this summer, i cannot imagine how anyone could do a start up successfully part time. there may be a few examples, but i don't know of many. i did it in school with my cofounder, and i could feel the gpa's drop.  surely your employer will notice you slacking if you're trying to work too hard on a start up.  even the ones who do it full time seem to struggle.<p>if i had to guess, it probably feels a bit like raising money and programming at the same time.  maybe less painful because you can program for about 14 hours out of your day.  but i really am a skeptic, and i'd say that having the laser focus is one of the best things in a start up.  our competition moves pretty fast, we would probably not be standing where we are now if we did this as a side project.",1253695399

How do you distinguish dragging to the edge of the first screen vs dragging onto the second\n* What is the persistence model between the two screens in independant mode? Do they share state or not?\n* Is this designed for specific, highly targeted applications or as a platform? If it's a platform, how do you intend to replicate the interaction paradigms of desktop apps such that they can either be trivially ported or completely rewritten?<p>My ultimate conclusion about this project has always been that it's been optimized to get papers into HCI conferences and not towards practical use.",1253694903

Many people overcommit themselves, or just say ""yes"" because they thought it was a good idea at the time.  I've experienced this sort of flakiness - and done it myself more times than I can remember.<p>You sound like the kind of person who prefers the social bonding that co-founders provide, as I do too.  However, sometimes you need to go it alone, because most people won't  be able to connect the dots the way you do.  In most of these situations, my motivation would peter out because there was no-one with which I could share the success.  Eventually, I sucked it up and rode on without a co-founder, and now I'm having the time of my life.<p>Startups are difficult, especially by yourself.

You answer your own question: products as widespread as IE6 cannot just be withdrawn overnight. It's quite a sensible move have the end-of-life the same as XP, when the corporate desktop moves from XP there IE6 will effectively be dead.

Same thing that's happened to the auto industry, the software industry (with open source), etc. Guns have become a commodity product.<p>This has happened to a lot of other guns. There are tons of clones of the AR-15, the Walther PPK, the Dragunov SVD, and the 1911. These are just off the top of my head, so I'm sure there are others. The only reason Colt / Armalite isn't in the same position is probably because our military is <i>way</i> more active than Russia's.

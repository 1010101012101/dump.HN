I am in the same position as you: zero debt (no mortgage or car payment even), almost all cash or precious metals and renting my home. So this panic doesn't mean anything personally in terms of drop in assets.<p>But I do see a fall in my income, so I am tightening my belt - by which I mean things like eating out less, stretching out that laptop for another few months, buying fewer non-essentials, less expensive vacations and so on. That is all I am advocating.<p>It is a rational, non-panicky response to some fairly dire economic circumstances ahead. If you question whether the economic circumstances will become dire, well, bookmark this thread, come back in 1 year, 2  years and 5  years.",1223823218

330316,comment,330179,330179,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Yes. Try git or mercurial (AKA ""hg"": <a href=""http://selenic.com/mercurial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://selenic.com/mercurial/</a>) rather than svn; both are much easier to set up and try out. When it only takes a second to set them up, you'll be more likely to experiment with them and discover what they're good at. SVN really doesn't have any real advantage over them these days.<p>There is a function in git and hg (an extension) called ""shelve"" which does exactly what you want - you can temporarily set aside the new feature in progress, commit the bugfix, and then go back to working on the feature. (If you knew <i>ahead of time</i> you were going to need to do this, it would probably have made more sense to do the feature in a branch, of course.)<p>People will argue back and forth whether git or hg is better, but in my experience they do the same things* , they just have different personalities. Pick one, get the hang of using it, and <i>then</i> experiment with the other - you'll be better able to make an informed decision. Both are significantly better than just about every other VC system.<p>* The advanced features they don't have in common are probably not going to matter until you know all the base functionality, and any new features in either will probably get ported to the other by then.",1223822774
330315,comment,330139,330298,0,0,startingup,,,"Total US debt (public, private & consumer) is 320% of GDP. Government alone is about 70% of GDP. Consumer debt is pushing 90-100% of GDP, historic high. Rest is private sector.  The 320% is a never-before-in-history number, even bigger than the great depression.<p>Income is what is used to service debt. Conventional mortgage rules limit you to 3x mortgage debt to annual income. So debt to GDP ratio is entirely appropriate.<p>The wealth figure you quote itself is bloated by debt - think of how houses increased in value due to all those easy loans they were handing out. Debt is a mathematical <i>fact</i>, unless discharged in some kind of bankruptcy, while the ""wealth"" is an accounting opinion, and valuations change. So as the debt comes due, more of it gets impaired, which means people who owned that debt have to write <i>their</i> assets down, which causes asset values to fall everywhere, ... classic debt-deflation. We are witnessing it right now.<p>The only meaningful end is when debt gets vastly reduced. By then asset valuations would be a lot lower too.",1223822767

330313,comment,329951,330106,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"So there is a New York Times article saying now might be a buying opportunity, and you readily find posts here in the same vein.  This STRONGLY indicates the bottom is a LONG way away.  At true secular bottoms nobody mainstream is even asking if the bottom is in; they're too scared off the asset class.<p>Think of the mirror image: the top.  In 2000 and 2007 did you repeatedly hear the press and random normal people debate if the top is in and things were set to plunge?  No, you didn't.  That's just not how mass market psychology works.",1223822686

So, no, Schadenstartup doesn't make much more sense.<p>I tried to think of a phrasing that would work for the idea, but nothing came to mind with a similar ring to it.  In kind of faux German, Startupschadenfreude, being sure to pronouce ""Startup"" as ""Schtartup"" might be amusing.  :-)",1223822637

330310,comment,330139,330139,0,0,fnazeeri,,,"The three points above all refer to the financial system.  I'm not entirely sold on this ""it's not just the financial system it's systemic"" argument.<p>The way I see it, the overall setup looks like this:<p>[capital] <--> [financial system] <--> [projects]<p>So basically the role of the financial system is to (i) allocate capital and (ii) manage risk.  I think it is totally clear that the financial system failed with the latter, but where is the evidence that it failed with the former?  With the ""subprime loans"" were the houses that were built shoddy?  It's not like as a world or nation we went out and built some giant white elephant that is now useless.  By and large the projects funded remain sound.  The problem is that the financial system has seized up.<p>A few folks have suggested that rather than pumping several trillion of new capital to save the existing disfunctional financial system, we should just pick 20 banks out of bankruptcy, capitalize them and basically replace the existing financial system with a new one (and then distribute the shares in these banks to all citizens so it's not a government run thing).<p>Bottom line, the financial system is broken, but I'm not sure the fundamental underlying ""projects"" are themselves broken.",1223822139

330306,comment,330139,330268,0,0,startingup,,,"Yes, I actually did purchase a meaningful (i.e as a fraction of my net worth) amount of gold, and have been buying for years. And for the rest of my net worth, I went all cash (dollar & yen) or short term treasuries some years ago - other than some small angel investments, which I will likely lose.  And I have been renting the place I live. So this 40% stock market crash or the real estate bust hasn't meant anything to me personally. All I am saying is that there were many very smart people warning about these exact issues (examples: Paul Volcker, Warren Buffet, Nouriel Roubini, Steve Roach, Doug Noland ...) for many <i>years</i>. Alas, their pessimism, based on facts and logic, has proved entirely justified.",1223821791

330304,comment,330179,330211,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The advantage of SVN is that it has been around longer, so you can (e.g.) find GUI software that leads you through it, like TortoiseSVN, or those two SVN clients for the Mac that conveniently came out just as I switched to git. :]<p>That's the only advantage, though. I frankly don't understand the notion that SVN is easier to learn than git. Git has its tricky points (like the index), and its documentation and teaching material have only recently emerged from obscurity, but I think it's conceptually more straightforward, particularly because you can use it without having to set up a server. And you can back up your entire repository by just dragging your working directory to some backup media, so crazy experiments feel a lot less risky.<p>Start at github. And I learned mainly from the git screencast at Peepcode and the Randal Schwartz Google talk on git.",1223821656

Sure, it's only in the US, the UK and Spain that a housing bubble has burst (AFAIK, still, that's more world wide than the US alone), but financial institutions are in trouble in Germany, in Belgium and the Netherlands as well (again, AFAIK). In Iceland the collapse of the banking system is so severe the country as a whole (not just the banks!) is effectively bankrupt.

There is a lot of explanations: goverenment (cheap money, urging to lend to poor), capitalism (complex derivates, greed), poor models (Blackswan), empty money (gold bugs). The same goes with attemps to solve the current crisis. There are too many ideas to count.<p>How do you expect better explanations of the past, if you hardly understand the events going on right now? Of course, the idea is that history was explained better and we can learn from it; the truth is that you end up with explaining reality with previous bad explanations, and your bad explanations will be used later...",1223821206

During the second I was doing external consultancy, and as my University contract was coming to an end, the company with whom I worked most closely offered me a job, which I took.<p>After many mergers, split offs and other coporate movements, I (and some colleagues) did a management buyout, so now I (part) own the descendant.<p>It's working well for me, but I think my position is a bit unusual.<p>Still, if you want to get into the commercial world, see if you can do some external consultancy while still employed by the University.

It also says: and our relationship is a formal one, such as staff to employer, and I'm in the subordinate position.</i><p>It sounds as if you are saying the lack of a short code in a language makes a concept untranslatable.<p>But that doesn't seem right. In 1943, I couldn't translate a document about nuclear reactors into French or Spanish because the only languages with words for ""nuclear reactor"" were English and German. Does that make ""nuclear reactor"" untranslatable?<p>Of course, once the concept became relevant to French speakers, they borrowed or created a short coding.<p>From what you've said, you can translate ""je vous en prie"" to ""you're welcome and I mean that with the respect a subordinate accords his superiors"". That just doesn't have a short coding in English because the concept being encoded is rarely relevant to English speakers.<p>In programming terms, (map f lst) translates to c, it's just not as short.",1261324519

1006199,comment,1005520,1005689,0,0,selven,,,"Anything that doesn't travel at 299792458 meters per second will not be a viable weapon in space. Two spaceships coming toward each other will be hundreds of thousands of kilometers away when they start firing on each other. The time lag will be over one second for lasers, so if the two ships are maneuvering randomly many laser shots will actually miss. Kinetic weapons will take minutes or hours to get there, making them essentially useless. With missiles (I'll assume missiles are nuclear here), not only are they slow but you can also set up computer controlled lasers to fry their control circuitry. Nukes require very specific detonation conditions and if you fry the explosive material it won't explode like a conventional weapon, it will just fail.<p>Also, with ships punching a hole in the bottom is enough to sink one - most ships hit by a one-shot-kill missile take a few minute to do down because they're sinking, not exploding. In space, this doesn't exist. You have fuel tanks and engines, but those can be safely put at the back of the ship, and in a battle you'll just rotate your ship so that the front faces the enemy.",1261322526

From here you can ask what problems the program has.  Yes, it's exponential in stack and runtime.  You can write an iterative version that runs in constant stack and linear time.

388512,comment,387921,388277,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Two things: again, I don't espouse the strongest form of Sapir Whorf. The interpretation of differences in speed of access to concepts, based on spread-activation, however, is solid. When I learned Sapir Whorf we were given the original interpretation and a brief of how it has been reinterpreted more recently -- but it still goes by the name of Sapir Whorf. I am not making a case for the possibility of expression. I am make a case for the <i>salience</i> of expressions in different languages. It should be easy to show this: take two languages and find two words of identical meaning, and measure the response speed to comprehension of these words. All other things equal, the higher-frequency word will be accessed faster. Hence, if one culture says Apple more than Orange, Apple is more salient in the former culture. You will then expect more efficient access to Apple-related concepts.<p>Second, what makes you think that natural languages do not differ in expressive power? Certain things are more easily said in one language than another, just as some constructs may be easier to represent in one language or another, although they may be able to create the same results.<p>I also don't know where you get the ""typically the same length"" from. Stephen Pinker wrote about the relative length of English in one of his books. I don't remember which he was comparing to, but English is longer. Pinker explained this along the lines of English being more ""fault tolerant"" due to more ""redundancy"" (my words).",1228610809

I've been looking to outsource the blog writing or re-writing of my content, but the search results on Google look more like spam than helpful orgs for this type of service. I am not even sure how much to pay for something like this.<p>Have you used a service to write (or proof read) blog posts?<p>How did you locate them: craigslist, elance, mechanical turk, some blog writer site, or something else?<p>What is the going rate for a small 100-150 word blog post?<p>I've seen prices advertised ""per page"". What the heck is the length of a ""page"" on a blog anyways?<p>Thanks in advance!",1228609006

118280,comment,117949,117949,0,0,mynameishere,,,"I was promised ""advice [I'll] never get"" but I think we've all been hearing about index funds for quite a while now. In fact, it's the current conventional wisdom. Buying index funds is probably tantamount to betting on the change in the GDP. The people who work in finance want nothing but incoming money, low fees or high fees, and .23 percent of a trillion dollars is still a pretty nice skim.<p>Well, the components of the S&P are publicly available: The most mathematically sound thing to do (if you have 200K or more) is to buy a sample (30 or more) stocks on the index through a broker, and your total costs will be about 300 dollars.  The one-time fee will be 300 / 200K = 0.0015 = .15 percent. Why aren't they recommending this course of action? Index funds are good because they are ""stupid"" (because stupid is cheap)...but anybody can do ""stupid"".<p>There is wealth to be extracted from people who think they are clever (but aren't) and people who think they are dumb (and are). You can make very good money on the market (1 percent a day or more) by buying on the noise. But this depends on one thing: An upward trend, however small. That upward trend depends only on money flows.<p>Re: Betting on the GDP. Notice the close similitude between the American and Foreign trends:<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=VFINX&l=on&z=m&q=l&c=VGTSX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?t=5y&s=VFINX&l=on&...</a><p>...with one rather frightening difference. Obviously, they are reacting to the same things, but one of them is looking unhealthy in a fundamental way.<p>My investment advice: Buy boxes of young, but good, wine. And cellar them. Only do this, however, if you don't like drinking wine.",1203361144

118244,comment,117938,118126,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Thanks for the interesting feedback.<p>I don't know to what extent a difference it makes, because everything I see, I think is obvious (forgot the term for this): I think holistic and heuristical thinking is the de facto, and most obvious way of dealing with multidisciplinary problems; in this case, I believe this falls into the same category as the ""wicked"" problems you describe. It seems like everybody on this forum has a fair amount of exposure to psychology, such that many concepts that I learned in a formal setting are in fact common sense. I have no idea how true this is, but I try to avoid stating the obvious, so I generally keep quiet about it.<p>I still suspect the following would be nothing new to you, but it's a different route of thinking so I'll write anyway.<p>A problem that ""cannot be clearly defined"" and has ""no clear answer"" is generally solved heuristically. This is an area where hard-earned experience, and not necessarily genius, pays off. Warfare is a good example, because it involves not only logistics but also understanding the enemy's culture and psychology and estimating their intelligence. Heuristics come from efficient processing of declarative and episodic memory, which are, very obviously, the result of accumulated experiences across diverse fields.<p>So regarding how to best design a car, it is logical to think that an engineer would be better than an artist, because they know what is required to make a car work, but an engineer with an art background is better than one without, because they can <i>efficiently</i> (i.e. long-term memory retrieval) co-synthesize knowledge pertaining to design and construction. This must also be the reason why pg says ""hackers who can design are dangerous.""<p>Your points about forum dynamics follow the same ideas. A flat discussion, which interferes with thought organization, forces readers to synthesize information as a whole, which places a larger stress in keeping relevant information in memory. A threaded discussion, on the other hand, has less stress on memory, because certain steps can be stored as logical patterns that draw from existing memory.<p>A very simple thought experiment to illustrate this could be as follows. Imagine a threaded discussion with these messages: man. suitcase. taxi. airport. airplane. country. building. meeting.<p>Next, a flat discussion: man. window. smoke. lake. chocolate. tree. bulldozer.<p>Now paint a mental image out of the information from these two threads. The first follows a very logical progression, is easier to remember, and can be painted in a fairly predictable manner. The second one seems more disparate, requires more memorization, and the end result is harder to imagine, a la the ""wicked problem.""<p>Hope I'm not too far down a tangent... I guess the relevance to the diagram is, it doesn't matter what diagram or map you use; the goal is simply to get all the facts into everybody's heads simultaneously. A mind map could work. A list would work. A powerpoint. Or, based on the type of stimulus, a mixture of things (my interest).",1203358330

You're just reinforcing the point that every choice has consequences...some intended, some not. For instance, the net increase in CO2 from your ""cycle to work"" respiration would, I suspect, be less damaging than the total net consequences of building, maintaining and driving a car. It'd be cheaper, too. Eating more greens might well make you fart more, though that's less than certain, but it would surely be less than the methane produced by the beef cattle that less-healthy eaters consume so voluminously.<p>Perhaps with some expansion, your reply could have made a serious contribution.

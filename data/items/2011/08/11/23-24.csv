2875362,comment,2875119,2875268,1,0,ljlolel,,,">> It's more just an annoyance of the language. Specifically, anonymous functions are must easier in JavaScript, so it was just easier to write read and write maintainable code.<p>That's pretty specious.  You can easily write a function defined inside a function that you can pass by just naming it.  ""Anonymous"" functions are just syntactic sugar.  Furthermore, writing a new python named function is easier (fewer chars) to write than a javascript anonymous function, so the ""sugar"" gained is moot.<p>Finally, as you build more and bigger systems, you realize that those multi-line anonymous functions you had you actually want to be named (for documentation) and tested.  So you'll end up de-anonymizing the complex (multi-line) ones anyway.<p>As for speed, why not compare a jit (v8) to a jit (pypy) ?",1313107072

2875360,comment,2873303,2874930,4,0,hexagonc,,,"I agree completely.  One of the key problems with software patents is the very idea that an algorithm is deemed worthy of patent protection simply because it is not obvious to the ""average practitioner"" of the art.  But what skills/level of creativity constitute ""average""?  What if you have a company, like Google, whose core hiring principle is to find people who have above average skill and creativity?  This seems to set up a perverse disincentive to hire smart people because the smarter they are, the more likely they are to rediscover on their own an idea that is already patented and thus violate it.<p>The fact is that if the idea patented truly is the best way of doing something then a lot of smart and above average developers are likely to unknowingly bump into that idea out of necessity.  And this seems to be a problem that is unique to software patents precisely because of the closeness of software to mathematics itself.  Some algorithms are provably optimal for a particular problem which means that everybody smart enough that faces that problem will solve it the same way.  If you're smart enough to come up with the best way of doing something on your own but can not use it because it was patented then you're forced into a wasteful outlay of creativity just trying to work around the patent.  I don't see this as spurring innovation or at least not worthwhile innovation.",1313107032

Let's get rid of the word ""software"" for a moment. Say I think that patents involving ducks shouldn't be allowed, for whatever reason.

2875322,comment,2873347,2873347,1,0,dan-k,,,"The big problem that keeps coming up with software patents is the fact that most of them are bogus, because of being trivial or unoriginal.  Barring cases of malicious intent by patent examiners, which are a completely separate issue from the viability of the patent system itself, the reason for that is that the patent examiners don't understand what constitutes non-obvious work in software.  In fact, I would guess that now there are very few fields in which it's feasible for someone who's not already familiar with the field to make that judgment in any reasonable amount of time.  Since the criteria for patent validity are based on how the work would be viewed by average people in the field, maybe we should put patent-granting into the hands of people in each field, who are actually qualified to evaluate such work.  Just have the central patent office keep records and oversee devolved organizations for each discipline, who actually control which patents are granted and what the terms of patents in that field are.  That way, not only can bogus patents be avoided, but fields with radically different environments won't be hampered by patent terms designed for other areas (e.g. software patents could have a much shorter duration than others).",1313105969

Patents encourage R&D. The relevant criticism here is to ask: does this incentive outweight the costs of the patent system as a whole? (These costs are many. They include: any friction on innovation generally; the costs of running the patent office; patent application; patent litigation; defense against patent litigation; patent portfolio acquisition; the opportunity cost of all these people spending all this money, time, energy, and brain power on patents.)<p>2. Disclosure. Relevant criticism: is it in fact that likely that interested parties wouldn't be able to independently develop a given innovation without the patent system? It seems fairly uncontroversial to say that, as it is, a company will only apply for a patent if they think the patent protection will actually last longer than any protection they would get from trade secrecy. I.e. if a company really thought trade secrecy would keep an innovation out of the hands of their competitors for longer than a patent would, they just wouldn't patent it and keep it as a trade secret instead. So almost by definition this is pretty clearly false.<p>3. High fixed cost, low marginal cost innovations don't have enough incentive. This seems like the strongest argument for patent <i>on some things</i>, but I have yet to see any strong citations to research that isn't done by or paid for by pharmaceutical companies. It's an empirical claim that needs to be tested, and it seems to me that the burden of proof is on the proponents of patent law, not opponents to disprove it.<p>4. Designing around patents leads to more innovation. This seems like a fairly obvious case of introducing artificial inefficiency. Sure, you might get some unrelated and unexpected benefits from all of this incidental research that you're forcing, but it seems pretty obvious that this is going to be a net friction on overall innovation.",1313105228

Specifically I remember an apparently reputable hacker offer to do so for $5000 with the intention of helping someone with no technical skills create a functional product that can be shown to investors/etc and improved on from there. Are there more of you out there? Right now I have a geolocation iPhone app idea that I'd like to pay to have built. I live in San Francisco and am willing to work with someone from the area.

And unless you are an active competitor to companies you aim to sue over said patent, you are not entitled to sue them. Those two things eliminate the nefarious motives both for selling, and for buying patents.<p>Those restrictions would not fully apply to the original inventor. If the patent resides with its originator, then the patent does not have any statute of limitation before dissolution (perhaps they reserve the right to bequeath?). But they can't litigate with that patent unless they're an active participant in the market to which the patent applies.<p>I'm sure there would be lots of refinement clauses, but those are the broad strokes, as far as I'm concerned.

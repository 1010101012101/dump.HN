5809872,comment,5805460,5806689,2,0,cbsmith,,,"> In a democracy, we try not to put too much power even in the hands of an elected official. Isn't it a problem that so much power resides with a corporation?<p>No, it really isn't. If you pretend for a minute that Google is a hive mind, with a single individual in control of its actions, it still doesn't have a power to match the federal government of the US, or even the President (who is a single elected official).<p>You keep going down this track and pretty soon you are arguing that you can't have capitalism and democracy at the same time.<p>>  But I do not for a second believe that Google's executives are so much better than all other good people running large corporations that actually do evil. Because, hey -- power corrupts.<p>The Don't Be Evil principle is actually a check on precisely this concern. By having it as a principle, it invites the executives to be challenged on this basis by everyone in the company. That is the entire point. Having a motto Don't Be Evil doesn't magically change the nature of your executive team. What it changes is how that team is challenged.",1370203189

US schools brainwash kids into thinking that democracy and freedom to criticize the government are inherently good concepts, but in reality they are only desirable because of the practical effects it may or may not produce. There are no universal morals, and because of that you can't say democracy is inherently ""right."" So I have to side with your parent and say that democracy is only ""right"" if you believe that its effects in improving society objectively are ""right."" Schools just simplify it as ""democracy is inherently right"" because its easier to indoctrinate that principle.",1370203139

And the reason has less to do with the decline of rugged individualism amongst soccer moms than the existence of a constant low-level background threat, whether from terrorism, a sizable underclass, law enforcement, or (this might be embarassing for some) alcoholism. They don't check IDs for alcohol in Singapore. If you want to see actual practical examples of freedom, you have to go to western Europe. However, if you say that it is the US which makes sacrifices to provide those freedoms, I will actually agree with you. For the record, I was born and raised in Singapore and have lived in the US for the last decade.<p>EDIT: all these debates have the political reek of programming language wars...

The word, which connoted a depressingly debilitating constellation of symptoms in cognition, communication, and perception when my sister was diagnosed, has been redefined year by year inside and outside of the psychiatric community until it means very little, subject to self-diagnosis based on perceived social anxiety among high-performing, high-IQ individuals who are able to initiate conversations, appreciate comedy, lie convincingly, have relationships, and master smalltalk.<p>She will never take part in the debate about whether an 'Aspie' gets to call themself 'ASD' or 'Autistic' or 'HFA', because she is not able to understand or speak about such topics;  She will never be able to campaign against the 'neurotypicals' efforts to create a cure or prevent the condition from occurring.  She will never be able to read how Jenny McCarthy cured her son of his seizure disorder or decide whether it constituted autism or speculate about thiomersal.<p>People like her are not able to speak up for themselves, and they've been quietly robbed of a word for their conditions.

Mental health is full of '6 out of 10 symptom' checklists;  I like to visualize them as 'constellations' rather than clouds, because they exist on their own - we just draw the lines along things that seemed to be clustered.  It is the particular looseness of the Autistic Spectrum that's allowed linguistic creep.  I don't assert that early-childhood regression, severe cognitive disabilities, barely-lingual, no eye contact, compulsive behaviors, self-harm, stimming, problems with loud noises, and seemingly random inappropriate decisions like disrobing or running into traffic or poking a stranger or trying to enter an interesting-looking house are the canonical Autism.

Brian D Foy doesn't work for Booking and he never has.<p>Booking tries to keep the big names you mentioned happy so that they don't spill the beans. These names get the best development projects and the big money. One of their job responsibilities as a senior developer is to advertise and say good things about the company. I concur with you that they play this game well. In fact open praise in developer forums about the company is a sure way to land good bonus.<p>They make tonnes of money but none of that is shared with the developers although they put up with the grunge work of fixing one of the worst Perl code in the industry patched up by people who left in a hurry.<p>I speak for those who are going to leave their family, friends at home with the hopes that they would be doing good work based on the big names working there only to find that the reality is totally different.<p>The treatment meted out to the rest of the developers is shameful and you know it and the Perl blog mentions all the pain points.<p>The expats do not know the local employment laws of Netherlands and Booking.com fully exploits this to the hilt.<p>And the truth can be found out easily from people who left the company and who currently do not get a direct/indirect monetary benefit of saying good things about the company, and given that you are recruiting for them and get approximately thousand Euro atleast for every successful lead, it disqualifies you.<p>------------<p>The Netherlands has employee friendly policies. After three years in a company, employees automatically get an ""indefinite"" contract. An ""indefinite"" contract ensures that the employer cannot kick out the employee on a whim unlike in the US.<p>Good Dutch companies give out indefinite contract to the expats at the beginning of their employment itself but not Booking.com.<p>Booking.com gives out a 1 year contract to start with and after every 2 years kicks out its developers and gets new ones. So the frequent hiring you see is one of the side-effects of this cheap policy.

5809735,comment,5807941,5807941,9,0,spcs,,,"This was a posted by a friend on Facebook:<p>Since I see that some friends have got excited about the recent events in Turkey I decided to write something about it and provide some context. I think it is good to know a bit of history of Turkey before AKP to understand what is going on there. It has been more than 10 years that AKP is in power so people might not know or may have forgotten the situation before AKP.<p>Turkey was ruled by ultra-nationalist ultra-secular militarist groups for decades. The military overthrow several elected governments and jailed politicians. Torture, extra-judicial killings, suppression, and corruption were widespread. The laws that people often object to are from that area and the constitution written by Turkish military, including insulting Turkishness being a crime. These groups who are sometimes referred to as Kemalists had the control of military, judicatory, academia, media, etc. Yet, they couldn't tolerate even the government being in the hands of people they didn't like. The large majority of Turks who are practicing Muslims were excluded. It was illegal to wear a head-scarf in universities and government departments in a country where over 70% of women wears head-scarf. Essentially these women were banned from attending university. Public officials and even university professors would be thrown out and even jailed if they showed any sign of nonsecular tendency. Writers and intellects were jailed for expressing opinions against Kemalist ideology. Erdogan, the current prime minister was jailed and banned from politics for 10 years for reading an old poem while he was the mayor of Istanbul. The existence of Kurds who are around 20 percent of Turkey's population were completely denied (not a joke)! Speaking or reading in Kurdish was banned and the popular Turkish singer Ahmad Kaya was forced to exile for saying that he will record an album in Kurdish. Popular political parties were closed regularly even when they won elections decisively. The news of corruption in police and politics was a regular daily routine as was the news of human rights violations.<p>In the years before AKP there were several short-lived governments by parties both on the left and on the right. Inflation was very high (hyperinflation), unemployment was high, governments were unstable. The value of Turkish lira dropped to a third in one night. Nightly interest rates tripled to completely ridiculous amount of 139%. You can look at Greece these days to have an idea of Turkey of that time. Turkish foreign policy was essentially dictated by the US government. There was a very harsh IMF imposed economic program so Turkey could pay its debts and a technocrat from world bank was imposed as the economy minister on the Turkish government to make sure they will implement what IMF wanted. The government and the country were in such a bad shape that it is almost unimaginable today after 12 years of AKP.<p>AKP was formed at that time. Erdogan was still under the ban from politics as well as many prominent politicians from his previous party. But some other politicians from the party were not under the ban. They created a new party: AKP (Justice and Development Party). Its members were moderate and pragmatist politicians from the banned party plus several other pragmatist and moderates from other right of the center parties. The current Turkish President Gul became the head of the party though Erdogan was significantly involved behind the senses. The party won a landslide election and has been continuously doing so for over a decade, increasing its share of votes in every election. You have to know that the length of Turkish governments before AKP to get a feeling of its significance: a few months!<p>Over a decade AKP has modernized Turkey, removed many of the laws that EU objected to, fought corruption in police and politics, improved the economy to its current amazing state, forced military out of politics, ... Until Syrian crises it had perfect relations with its neighbors. It followed what I would consider an awesome independent foreign policy. It is trying to find a political solution to the Kurdish ""problem"" and the right of Kurds have improved significantly under AKP. The list of AKP's achievements can go on.<p>So what is the problem? The problem is that the support base of AKP is not the western oriented seculars, it is the conservative majority who didn't have a voice in politics for decades (the silent majority) as the Kemalist and what Turks call ""Deep Government"" didn't allow the political parties supported by them. In all elections AKP has lost in the touristic Mediterranean coastal cities and European parts. You can find the map of the last general election results here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_general_election,_2011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_general_election,_2011</a><p>Yellow is AKP, red is CHP, and light green is MHP. The south eastern parts are Kurdish areas where independent Kurdish politicians won.<p>The protests that you see these days are by this secular minority who has been voting for CHP (around 25%, significant, but still a minority).<p>Now, what are these alternative parties?<p>MHP is an ultra-nationalist racist conservative far-right party. Look up Wikipedia if you want to know more about them.<p>CHP is the party of the founder of the Turkey, ruled Turkey for decades in a one-party system, is a Kemalist party. It had strong relations with Turkish military, right now it is essentially the party supported by the elite who ruled Turkey before AKP and their supporters. The elite tried to topple AKP government undemocratically. Try to see if they objected to continuous serious violations of human rights before AKP.<p>Obviously I don't agree with everything that AKP and Erdogan do. However, AKP (and Erdogan) is definitely the best thing that has happened to Turkey over many decades, and Turks know it. That is the reason AKP keeps increasing its share of vote in elections. They are creating a strong developed democratic lawful independent Turkey. When you hear about protests in Turkey against AKP and Erdogan being authoritarian it is good to remember this context.<p>One final thing: AKP is often criticized for ignoring secular Turkish citizens who have not voted for AKP. Watch Erdogan's victory speech after winning the last election in which AKP further increased its share of votes. His attitude was completely humble and reconciliatory.<p>The problem, in my humble opinion, is not Erdogan and AKP being arrogant and authoritarian, but rather the secular minority demanding more than their fair share. I mean they objected to the removal of the ban on head-scarves for students attending university and consider it Islamization of Turkey (a country where over 70% of women wears head-scarf).",1370201087

The only jobs I worked were from age 12 to 19.<p>I outlined how I did it a little in a post yesterday:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5805627"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5805627</a><p>This is two brain dumps in two days, maybe I should be putting this on a blog, apologies if that's more appropriate.  Apologies for typos or grammar, I'm writing this in one pass before heading out.<p>To dig into the comment about finding your first customers.....<p>My formula, which I recommend you consider trying some or all of (and has worked for friends making the jump):<p>- Keep your job.  You are not here to learn developer skills, but business skills.  You will build up your part time income to take over what you make full time.  Too much work? It's probably a fair comparison to how much work getting and fulfilling contracts will be until you get the hang of it so dive in.  Just be prepared to work more to have the flexibility to do what you want.  There are some incredibly insightful tips in this thread overall, especially the few at the top.<p>- Business skills are something you will be learning forever, like coding.<p>- The first business skill you need to learn is value. Then, creating it, in a reasonably sustainable way that you can then start to rely on.<p>- The second business skill you must do is come to some sort of working peace with money if you have any issues with making it or issues with what your professional value is.  I regularly bully/coach friends into business for themselves and can be available to give you a few words of advice.  For me, it's becoming like credits in a video game to do other thing I want on top of interesting and meaningful work.  I do some tougher work that pays better, so I can spend time with a startup or idea I like at a discounted rate, or put in more time than normal where you like.<p>- My currency is respect and customers who know it get way more from me without me being able to help myself.  The ones who don't seem to filter themselves out.  This may or may not be for you but whatever it is for you, the sooner you can get a sense of what it is, and develop it forever, the easier you'll have a compass to know if something is right or not.<p>- You're welcome to dive in to beat the statistics, but you will stand a better chance if you start freelancing and slowly building it up by finding long term customers.<p>- SMB's want one guy to shoot.  They don't care that it's the server's fault, the isp's fault, a bug in the code, or a bug in the platform or framework.  They want the one interface who is like a department or interface to them to get that wing of their business sorted out.  They'll be ok if you find someone and manage them for cost + 10% if they don't want it.<p>- The more they think of you when they have problems that need solving, the more you'll end up having long term customers for 4-10 years like I have.  I don't say yes to all the work, sometimes I help them hire, sometimes I help them find a vendor, sometimes I hire the vendor for them and train them, sometimes I sub them out under myself, it totally depends on the situation, my availability and interest, but bottom line is I'm paid well for my time to figure it out for them and monthly retainers become that much more valuable to them<p>- Many small to medium businesses may not have a full time position, but have enough to afford $500-$1500 a month.  Either this work needs to be right up you alley, or trivial for you to do and deliver effectively and consistently.  It might be a technical retainer, or a certain amount of bug fixes, or features, etc.<p>- Don't have an ego.  I started doing networking, IT support, fixing printers, and then once I did the six month ""network stabilization"" the customer naturally turned to software support. I wasn't above doing anything.  If the computer needed to be cleaned out from dust, I did it.  That attention to detail is what one day had me doing the replenishment orders for a billion dollar retail company on a weekly basis by analyzing what they sold in the past week and what they should try the next week as an experiment.<p>- I'm a full stack guy though and it helped me a lot get in the door to fix something trivial or figure out something finicky and after I did that, the relationship was great.  Being that person that came in and took care of a small thing that was important is a great way to get in, most of my referrals came this way too because business owners like showing off their people to other business owner buddies.  I recommend you be as full stack as your honest interest allows.  Along the way you will find the things that you love more than others, and I lump them into necessary evil (complex hosting hosting the projects I build) vs what I love (building the software that never goes down)<p>- It is far more preferable to find 10 customers who will pay you $1000 a month (that's 100 hours billable at $100/hr) than to look for all of it in one place.  If one dies, changes, or disappears, you won't sink.  Chances are you might find 4-5 customers that pay $2000.<p>- Deliver monthly summary reports of the value you provided.  Number of requests, what you solved, what you looked into on your own initiative, savings you helped create or increase, money you helped them make, etc.  Attach it to the invoice every time.  It's the only permanent record you'll have when you look back in 4-7 years.<p>- One thing that didn't exist as much 10 years ago was remote development and remote access.  PCAnywhere was the king and it helped me learn how lay down a remote developer life with visits in person as needed.  What I did was to offer not to bill customers for travel time, or a minimum on-site bill and instead charge them by the quarter or half hour if they'd let me work with them via screenshare (if it was necessary).  It's a fair trade with the right customer.  Be open to learning how well screensharing as needed can work for you.<p>- As you're starting out, reach out to small and medium size businesses like yourself.  They like the one on one, ""I'm dealing with someone like me"" approach.  They should not balk at expecting to pay $500 to $1500 a month for something they need, or to have you on call.<p>If you want help crafting such a pitch, I can help you.  I have helped friends learn to win small contracts on CL, etc, and work their way up.  I believe that there's some level of business skills you learn here that here that are hard to learn anywhere else. Once you know you can make a relationship and deliver value, possibilities can open up.<p>Hope some of this was useful or at least interesting, if anyone has any questions, feel free to get in touch.",1370200949

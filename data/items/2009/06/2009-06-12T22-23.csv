In other words, the government cannot interfere with your right to publish a newspaper, and similarly it can't interfere with your right to publish on the internet. In a sense, this is a question of due process.<p>Note that I am not advocating the position that there should be no way for the government to sever your connection or that there should be any obligation for it to be provided. The government does not provide printing presses, either. If you commit a crime and are convicted of it, you can have your right to internet access terminated in the same way in the US you'd lose the right to bear arms or vote.<p>That you say this is a worthless opinion doesn't really help your position. Ad hominem argumentation does no one any good.<p>I see this situation as being similar to what happens in the US when legislation is overturned by the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds. You have the opportunity to go back and make the legislation compliant. It sounds like that could be done in this case.",1244846739

And yet, that was the content judged newsworthy! I think it's clear that people vastly overestimate the importance of their own words and opinions.

What I've found success with is similar, try to find environments where ideas are already being proven and take the best parts. I adapted an HTML widget that was making the rounds on layout/generator sites to become a Facebook widget, and that reached 9 millions users.<p>What upset me though was the difficulty of monetizing some small fun widget. So next I looked at what is working on Facebook and that could also make money, and found some widgets where you can collect points to rank higher among your friends. Sort of like social games, just without the game part. I implemented a similar app, but simplified it even further. It is doing very well and is now in the top 20 apps on MySpace.<p>I had no success at all with ideas that were purely my own, and had to look for elements elsewhere.

C# is more expressive and concise than Java, C# supports unsafe (pointer) operations inside unsafe blocks which is very valuable for a game engine if such a thing is required. Mono has a more powerful eventing model through the use of delegates, where the Java equivalent of using anonymous inner classes is much more syntax and runtime heavy. C# supports semantic closures and has iterators, very useful features for scripting support.<p>Plus Mono is more open than Java, was developed by open source community, therefore was already more easy to modify than Java, which has in house developed source.<p>My 2c.",1244845188

Now if you are even a remotely competent programmer, yous should be able to find work around for up to 10 changes in say, an afternoon?<p>The rest are more complicated, the next 3,000 or so reports will likely take from a week worth of work to a full scale reimplementation effort (the ones that have up to say 300 P/Invoke calls).<p>As for innovation in Mono: nothing anywhere says that we should stop at working on compatibility with .NET.   We created Mono to create better applications for Linux, which is why we created bindings to Gtk# as well as some other couple hundred libraries: because we want to improve our ecosystem.",1244844127

But ONLY because this is a transparent example of how their writing fails recently.<p>The story is valid and the content of the article is fairly accurate: that the status ID's are going to trip over beyond the 32-bit integer limit which presents potential problems for <i>third parties</i>.<p>Twitter sensibly pushed this forward by a few hours to make sure it happened in a ""were noticing shit right now"" period and thus got fixed. They announce this by tweeting a tongue in cheek ""Twitapocalypse"" message.<p>The crucial problem is that TC siezed on that idea and hammered at it - yes they do mention it will only affect apps BUT<p>- They dont mantion that it wont kill Twitter, inference from the article theoretically could go either way and I imagine many people left the page worried Twitter would crash and burn (and that the Twitterati were beavering away to ""fix"" things). Lines like ""Hopefully Twitter will be able to resolve this quickly."" emphasis this idea subtely.<p>- They heavily suggest Twitter themselves are working on this. Whiklst im sure they are trying ot make sure app developers notice it I seriouslky doubt they have all hands on deck to ""fix"" an issue they themselves arent facing. They were courteous enough to push it up into working hours to give devs a chance to fix errors ""live"" etc. But there is nothing Twitter themselves have to do, right?<p>All in all it's a good story written very badly - as a journalist I have to take issue with the sensationalism. It hurts the vendor and wosre it hurts the readers it dupes.<p>:)<p>EDIT: to be explicit. It smacks less of bad writing as <i>deliberately</i> badly structured writing to suck in an audience.

Not for sure, anyway. Here is an excerpt from a paper describing the find:<p>&quot;Three different interpretations have been proposed: as ‘altars’, as ‘hearths’ and as ‘platforms’ [...]. The notion of ‘altars’ presupposes some ritual function and would be supported by differential concentrations of figurines, or other so-called ritual objects. However, there is no such concentration of ritual finds. The expected evidence to support the notion of ‘hearths’ would be the identification of burnt fired clay fragments, allied to concentrations of charcoal and/or ash close to the features. The absence of burning near these features diminishes the likelihood that they were ‘hearths’. Nonetheless, short-term, low-temperature fires in the middle of a raised seating area for ritual participants may well have left few traces of ash or charcoal. The term ‘raised area’ is a more neutral term, indicating a proper concern with a feature that is raised from the ground-surface of the me- ga-structure, on which people could have sat or ritual objects could have been placed for short-term performances - objects which were then removed to other contexts [...]&quot;<p>Once again, the popular press slightly twists science to present a &quot;more interesting read&quot;...<p>(Source: <a href=""http://www.jna.uni-kiel.de/index.php/jna/article/view/110"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jna.uni-kiel.de/index.php/jna/article/view/110</a>)",1450482814

10761797,comment,10761186,10761487,0,0,luckynonce,,,"For an alternative perspective:<p>&quot;The database logs created by NGP VAN show that four accounts associated with the Sanders team took advantage of the Wednesday morning breach. Staffers conducted searches that would be especially advantageous to the campaign, including lists of its likeliest supporters in 10 early voting states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. Campaigns rent access to a master file of DNC voter information from the party, and update the files with their own data culled from field work and other investments. After one Sanders account gained access to the Clinton data, the audits show, that user began sharing permissions with other Sanders users. The staffers who secured access to the Clinton data included Uretsky and his deputy, Russell Drapkin. The two other usernames that viewed Clinton information were “talani&quot; and &quot;csmith_bernie,&quot; created by Uretsky&#x27;s account after the breach began. The logs show that the Vermont senator’s team created at least 24 lists during the 40-minute breach, which started at 10:40 a.m., and saved those lists to their personal folders. The Sanders searches included New Hampshire lists related to likely voters, &quot;HFA Turnout 60-100&quot; and &quot;HFA Support 50-100,&quot; that were conducted and saved by Uretsky. Drapkin&#x27;s account searched for and saved lists including less likely Clinton voters, &quot;HFA Support <30&quot; in Iowa, and &quot;HFA Turnout 30-70&quot;&#x27; in New Hampshire. Despite audit logs, Weaver said at the news conference that NGP VAN has told the campaign that no Clinton data was printed or downloaded.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-12-18/sanders-campaign-fires-data-director-after-breach-of-clinton-files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-12-18/sander...</a>",1450482355

I also abused dissociatives like Ketamine. Ketamine&#x27;s antidepressant effects seemed very real after the initial high and it was qualitatively different from SSRIs. SSRIs seemed <i>more</i> like a drug than Ketamine which felt more like relief (again, for the days following the high - the actual high was, you know, psychedelic and stuff). I think for some people research into this area would be a real boon. Not everyone responds well to traditional treatments. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s different about my brain that makes even high doses of SSRIs ineffective or even unpleasant, but I don&#x27;t think we understand all that well how depression actually works at all, other than SSRIs and similar seem to kind of work.<p>If you think depression is about just increasing serotonin in the brain, let me point out that &quot;serotonin syndrome&quot; is a very real risk of using antidepressants. It&#x27;s essentially an overdose on serotonin.

The claims that the Sanders campaign had reported an earlier issue are refuted in the OP, which states they had reported issues with another vendor&#x27;s software.<p>It is possible the bug was abused:<p>&quot;The database logs created by NGP VAN show that four accounts associated with the Sanders team took advantage of the Wednesday morning breach. Staffers conducted searches that would be especially advantageous to the campaign, including lists of its likeliest supporters in 10 early voting states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. Campaigns rent access to a master file of DNC voter information from the party, and update the files with their own data culled from field work and other investments.\nAfter one Sanders account gained access to the Clinton data, the audits show, that user began sharing permissions with other Sanders users. The staffers who secured access to the Clinton data included Uretsky and his deputy, Russell Drapkin. The two other usernames that viewed Clinton information were “talani&quot; and &quot;csmith_bernie,&quot; created by Uretsky&#x27;s account after the breach began.\nThe logs show that the Vermont senator’s team created at least 24 lists during the 40-minute breach, which started at 10:40 a.m., and saved those lists to their personal folders. The Sanders searches included New Hampshire lists related to likely voters, &quot;HFA Turnout 60-100&quot; and &quot;HFA Support 50-100,&quot; that were conducted and saved by Uretsky. Drapkin&#x27;s account searched for and saved lists including less likely Clinton voters, &quot;HFA Support <30&quot; in Iowa, and &quot;HFA Turnout 30-70&quot;&#x27; in New Hampshire.\nDespite audit logs, Weaver said at the news conference that NGP VAN has told the campaign that no Clinton data was printed or downloaded.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-12-18/sanders-campaign-fires-data-director-after-breach-of-clinton-files"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-12-18/sander...</a>",1450481379

For example, Facebook&#x27;s first new grad job states that I must have 3+ years of solving analytical problems using quantitative approaches and that I must be a &#x27;strong programmer.&#x27;<p>But I don&#x27;t consider myself a strong programmer. As a young soon-to-be graduate, I have big gaps in my software know-how. I&#x27;ve never worked on large-scale projects. I&#x27;ve never programmed on a team. I&#x27;ve never done unit testing. I&#x27;ve never used version control except a tiny bit of GitHub. I&#x27;m not experienced in a UNIX shell. I can&#x27;t explain how TCP/IP works.

I&#x27;ve heard the possibly untrue claim that men tend to apply when they meet just 60% of the requirements.<p>(3) Also, how can I get a better sense of whether I&#x27;m a &#x27;strong programmer&#x27; or not? I&#x27;m surrounded by a non-representative community of programmers, so I&#x27;m aware my self-evaluation may be way off.<p>(4) I thought that starting a software internship might teach me some of the skills I lack, but from looking at Google and other companies, they only accept students who are returning to school in the fall.

Therefore trucks will soon be obsolete, and all cargo will be moved with cars.<p>He&#x27;s not totally wrong. Mobile is the future.

But he falls down when he tries to push his argument too far and argue that mobile will eclipse desktop/laptop <i>completely</i> and we&#x27;ll all be staring at 3.5&quot; screens. I will say this until someone shows me a viable port of SolidWorks, Visual Studio, or Revit Architect that is usable on a smartphone.

AR that is really useful? brainwaves? who knows) or a mobile device that <i>converts</i> into a desktop when you plug a monitor into it and pair it with a keyboard. It would also have to be capable of being used with as much versatility as a PC, which would mean significant evolution of mobile OSes. Personally I doubt convergence... because why? Silicon is so cheap there is no economic driver for anyone to invest the development necessary for mobile to &quot;swallow PC.&quot; It&#x27;s cheaper and easier to just use two separate devices and let them deeply specialize and optimize for their respective roles. A car/truck convertible is possible too, but the result would probably be an oversized gas guzzler car with poor handling that converts into a shitty underpowered truck with poor capacity.<p>I also think he&#x27;s wrong about mobile being the center of gravity. Mobile devices are dumb terminals for accessing the cloud. If there&#x27;s an emerging new &quot;sun&quot; to replace the PC it&#x27;s the cloud, not mobile.

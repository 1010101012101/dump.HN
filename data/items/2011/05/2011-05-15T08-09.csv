2549623,comment,2549462,2549462,3,0,erikb,,,"I think your assumption in the beginning is correct! People have no idea about hiring and just do what comes to their mind first: application, interview, get started.<p>That is not a good way to hire.<p>But then you start to make the same mistake these badly hiring people do: You think you need to do all the science by yourself. But actually there is a solution to most hiring problems as there is a solution to most programming problems. And there is a science who spents a lot of time and money of a lot of people to improve the methods available and to find models more applicable. You can even study that stuff in university and get a degree for that.<p>So please, take that stuff seriously and do what everybody in a hiring situation should do: Learn what humankind already has available on the topic or pay someone who already did the learning!<p>PS: Yes, when you start to find out enough about this topic, you will see it is quite boring. You solve problems like everywhere else, too. First you try to apply a model to the best of your knowledge and then you just use the methods connected to the model. Both, the models and the methods, can be found in a lot of text books and also online.",1305449762

2549614,comment,2548665,2549027,1,0,kaiwetzel,,,"I was a little disappointed by the article in this regard. While it's mentioned that ""There is a small portion of the population — he estimates it at around 5 percent or even less — who, for what researchers think may be genetic reasons, can maintain their performance with five or fewer hours of sleep. (There is also a small percentage who require 9 or 10 hours.)"" it would be very interesting to know if there is a larger than 5% group that does just fine with 6 or 7 hours of sleep.<p>Assuming your assumption about the distribution of ""needing x hours of sleep to do well"" is correct and if we assume that 5% need only 5 hours or less and the mean is at 8 hours (the article is even unclear about what those 8 hours represent so it's a wild guess at best), how large is the percentage of people needing 7.5 hours or less? (Roughly 40% if it's a normal distribution). So what the article says about ""most of us"" is technically correct the interesting answers for the many of us that presumably need between 5 and 8 hours of sleep is left out.<p>Does it make a difference in what sleep phase people are woken up (after the n hours of sleep their group gets)? I wish more money would be available for this area of research so longer and more detailed studies could be done. And better handouts for journalists.",1305449299

The article is a vivid portrayal of the state of technology in the strange world of Hong Kong nearly two decades ago, when it was in the odd position of being an almost modernized city, preparing to rejoin a significantly less developed far larger country. I love Neal Stephenson's writing -- this article being so incredibly well-written makes it worse, in fact -- but the side notes on gosh, how decadent and backwards China's totalitarian Communist government is! Unfair, inaccurate, <i>prejudicial</i>, presumptuous and elitist. American democracy hasn't been a roaring success anywhere besides America.

R+W>N) - one gets consistent data back on reads. This is flat out misleading. On close analysis one observes that there are no barriers to joining a quorum group (for a set of keys). Nodes may fail, miss out on many many updates and then rejoin the cluster - but are admitted back to the quorum group without any resynchronization barrier.""<p>That's because adding a barrier (a) isn't necessary for the consistency guarantee, (b) doesn't add any extra safety in the worst case, and (c) adds complexity (always be suspicious of complexity!)<p>Consider the simple case of a 3-node cluster (A, B, C) with N=3.<p>For quorum reads and writes, R = W = 2.<p>Then reads will be consistent if any two nodes are up.  It doesn't matter if nodes A and B are up for the write, then B and C are up for the read -- the reader will still always see the latest write.<p>Of course you will have to block writes and reads if more than one node is down for either operation.  This is what the dynamo paper means when it talks about allowing clients to decide how much availability to trade for consistency.<p>The rest of the article is basically variations of this theme.  (The only way to provide ""strong consistency is to read from all the replicas all the time""!?  Wrong, wrong, wrong.)",1257111332

915610,comment,915212,915212,0,0,werner,,,"Dynamo is still in use, but as with all technologies that have to operate at Amazon's scale, the systems evolve rapidly. The storage systems in use now no longer look like the ones from 5 years ago when Dynamo was developed.<p>The Dynamo SOSP paper had two goals: 1) show how systems are a composition of techniques and how all of these need to work together build a production system 2) given that it was based on a variety of research results it was intended to give feedback to the academic community about the difficulties of moving from research results to production, and what matters in real-life vs production.<p>The paper was never intended to be a complete blueprint for easy design of follow-up systems.There just isn't enough room in an academic paper to do justice to that. If it was going to have any role in that the best we could hope for was as a collection of points you would have to think hard about and make decisions about when you were going to design your own storage engine.<p>That doesn't means I agree with the conclusions of the analysis, on the contrary, I think they are seriously flawed as well (as with everything else that is not absolutely perfect :-)). But I can understand that when people look for the dynamo paper to be a blueprint that solves all their storage needs and provides a perfect available service under all failure scenarios (and solves world peace), that they may be left with a few questions afterwards.<p>I always thought that the real contribution of the paper was that it made you think hard about the trade-offs you are faced with when you have to design high-available, ultra-scalable systems that are cost-effective and provide guaranteed performance. 5 years later we know a lot more but this stuff is still hard, and we still need to balance rigorous principles with production magic to make it work. But you do need to fully understand the principles before you can make the production trade offs.<p>Caveat: some of these remarks were tongue-in-cheek fun; I leave it to the reader which ones :-)",1257110999

Sure, you can build a centralized system with a critical core that has near-zero downtime - usually at great operational cost - but there's not a bank in the world that's actually 99.999% available <i>to customers, over the internet</i>.  Most retail banks I've used take several hours of outages <i>per month</i> for maintenance on their web services.<p>Amazon wants its systems not just to keep running but to keep taking orders from millions of people all over the world.  This means that they are concerned with the reliability not just of a storage server, but everything needed to connect it to its application servers and to customers.  They have found that the cost-effective way to do this is to distribute every component across geographically separated datacenters.  Amazon has remained available through real and simulated datacenter-wide outages ranging from power/cooling failures to floods, fire, and hurricanes.  No Amazon system lives within a single building, much less a single network switch or rack.<p>Finally, although the formally provable aspects of Dynamo's ""eventual consistency"" guarantee may be vague, any team operating a distributed system will study and understand the actual operational characteristics in practice, under both normal conditions and various failure modes.  Some systems may have realistic failures that lead to days or hours of inconsistency (in which case the team has deliberately chosen this and will write client software to be aware of it); others might be tuned to achieve consistency within milliseconds under normal operation and to set off alarms within seconds after a failure.  I've never known any that would be used in circumstances where ""human lifetimes"" are a relevant time period.",1257110985

The new protocol, over UDP, is more difficult for ISPs to throttle without harming everything else on UDP (VoIP, games, streaming video, etc) that people regularly use (AFAIK.)<p>That being said, they really did create the new protocol to have more elegant throttling. Morris: ""It’s not QoS, but rather a congestion management mechanism implemented at the end-user’s layer 7 [Application]. This will stop uTP from eating up traffic bandwidth reserved for latency sensitive apps like VoIP and gaming. What’s more, the congestion management mechanism isn’t something we implemented as an afterthought – it’s the whole point of uTP."" from <a href=""http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-2-0-to-elimininate-the-need-for-isp-throttling-091031/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-2-0-to-elimininate-the-need...</a><p>Looking forward to it, even though Comcast doesn't seem throttle my BitTorrent traffic at my location (North Bay area.)",1257109259

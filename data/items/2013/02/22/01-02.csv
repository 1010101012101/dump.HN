We never ""turned off the Requests functionality for apps that are not labelled as games, breaking many live apps."" We never turned off requests. We never broke a single app.<p>What we did do was test the impact of issuing a notification for a new app request for several categories of apps. The sending and delivering of requests still worked through this test and nothing broke. Users could still send requests and they could receive them on Facebook.<p>The key thing to bear in mind is that our APIs often express ""intent"", not specific UX actions on Facebook.com or our mobile apps. We are always testing new user experiences to see what the best experience is for a given intent from an app. Such was the case with this test.<p>Again, no apps were broken, we were simply testing if/when/how we should surface notifications for app requests to users.<p>We have concluded this particular set of tests and if we are going to make some permanent changes, we will make sure to inform our developer community.",1361498207

5262025,comment,5261711,5261972,18,0,breckinloggins,,,"> Who owns these?<p>It varies.  Sometimes they are still owned by the original tenants but often they are owned by a real estate investor that did triple net leases to large clients.  In some cases, the buildings are owned by the city or some other government entity.<p>The best way to find out is to take a trip to the local courthouse.<p>> How difficult would it be to purchase one?<p>Assuming the owner wants to sell, probably a bit difficult.  But no more difficult than any other large commercial real estate purchase.  The buildings usually don't have some special status just because they are ""abandoned"".  Things that WILL make acquisition more difficult, however, is if the building is an historical landmark, condemned, has asbestos or other environmental problems, is scheduled for demolition by the city, has lots of lien holders and a complicated title, etc.  But all of this is just another way of saying that large real estate transactions can be challenging.  There's a reason there are large law firms exclusively devoted to this stuff.<p>> how expensive?<p>It depends on why it was abandoned.  If the existing tenant just went out of business or otherwise moved out due to their own problems or reasons, then the building will probably be priced similarly to other properties in the area (in other words, it's not a given that 'abandoned' somehow entails a price break).<p>If there are severe location problems (like many places in Detroit, for example) then there may be breaks based on that.<p>Lastly, if there are severe environmental, structural, or other problems with the property itself, you might be able to purchase it for a song, but that doesn't mean you won't have to spend megabucks to fix it so you can get a certificate of occupancy.  Watch out!<p>Another way to think of all this is that the word 'abandoned' is a romantic term with connotations of artistic urban decay.  However, sometimes it's just a vacant building.  There's nothing special about it just because no one is currently in there.<p>> It would be cool to live in one of these (with power and running water, of course) and have freight elevators, PA systems and escalators in your home.<p>Probably not as cool as you're envisioning.  Every one of these things has to be maintained and/or replaced.  That's probably going to be just <i>slightly</i> more expensive than calling a residential plumber.  Your heating, water, and sanitation bills are likely to be atrocious simply because it's a large building in (probably) an area zoned for commerce.  What good is all that space if you have to keep all of it dark except for a few hundred square feet?<p>Then, of course, you have to worry about squatters and other people who won't realize or won't care that there's someone living in there.  I don't know about you, but I'd prefer my home to be a sanctuary and not have to constantly worry whether I'm going to run into a trespasser who may or may not be friendly.<p>But hey, despite all this if you can find a really cool abandoned building and live in it, be sure to blog about it and take pictures so we can all live vicariously through you!",1361497961

The law said that there were a variety of conditions that must be met to be eligible for the tax break and this was one of them. Every requirement had to met to get the tax break, since one was unconstitutional the tax break itself couldn't stand.

This is more of a question of nice design than anything else, but that's worth something (and the same reason we shouldn't needlessly include a scheduler in our programs.)<p>Another point is that most of these high-concurrency languages aim to satisfy that same 90+% in addition.

It's the only way to usefully use your field of view. This is why wider aspects exist.<p>On my 16:9 aspect 27"" desktop screen, my vision is practically filled in the vertical direction -- it is easier to glance to the horizontal edges than the vertical ones. I would use more horizontal space before I used more vertical.<p>And this is the point of wider aspects -- they use your eyes better. If you buy three screens for your desktop, you don't stack them vertically -- you arrange them horizontally so you can actually see them.<p>People who keep asking for squarer displays for work should simply get <i>bigger</i> displays and stop pretending that a 13"" laptop display is ever a good choice for a working display.<p>Frankly, anything sub 24"" is not a working environment. Anything smaller is either (a) something you use occasionally when you're not at your desk or (b) for people who are not working.",1361495028

5261833,comment,5259117,5261602,1,0,rayiner,,,"So in most negligence cases, plaintiffs have to prove that the defendant failed to exercise ""reasonable care."" That is to say, the defendant failed to live up to the standard of caution that society had established for his activities. The standard is context-specific, but is almost always an objective one. What would a ""reasonable person"" have done in that situation? What would a ""reasonable store owner"" have done about the ice on the sidewalk in front of his store? In answering this question, the jury gets to impose its understanding of how an ordinary person should behave. This is true even in technical situations. Engineers at car companies are ultimately held to the standard of ""did they behave like a reasonable person would?"" Expert testimony can help explain to the jury what it needs to know to decide that question, but its the jury that gets to decide where the bar should be.<p>Medical malpractice is different. In medical malpractice, the relevant inquiry is: ""what would a reasonably competent doctor practicing in a similar community have done?"" That is to say, medical communities (e.g. rural hospitals in TN or urban hospitals in NY) get to establish the standard for how much caution doctors should exercise. Expert testimony is admitted to explain to the jury whether or not the doctor adhered to those standards. The jury doesn't get to establish the standard, only to determine based on expert testimony whether the standard was met.<p>The practical takeaway is this: ""most deep oil drilling engineers do this"" is a far weaker defense in a regular negligence suit than ""most doctors do this"" is in a malpractice suit. The medical profession is allowed to regulate itself in a way that say oil drilling companies are not.<p>As for alternatives, here's one paper that gives a pretty good literature review and suggests some alternatives: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195420/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195420/</a><p>Richard Epstein's (a very prominent law professor) suggestion is to let patients contract with hospitals ahead of time to agree on dispute resolution mechanisms: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124631652544770707.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124631652544770707.html</a><p>As a general matter, there are a fixed set of ways to deal with this kind of problem. You can have private litigation (as in the malpractice system); you can have government regulation and enforcement (e.g. as in environmental protection); you can have administrative claims systems (e.g. as in workers compensation or no-fault auto insurance).<p>The alternative to the malpractice system is one of the above. It's not capping damages for a grossly negligent baby delivery to $50,000 despite the fact that it could easily be an injury of several million to the baby and his family (and ultimately to society through lost productivity).",1361494898

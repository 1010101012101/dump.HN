Here is an excerpt from ""The Human Race Has, Maybe, Thirty-Five Years Left"" by David Lyle, originally appearing in 1967 <i>Esquire</i>:<p>""Dr. Barry Commoner reported recently (in his book, <i>Science and Survival</i>) that the burning of fuels has caused the carbon-dioxide content of the earth's atmosphere to rise fourteen percent in the past century. This has produced a general warming effect on the atmosphere. The President's [Johnson, I suppose] Science Advisory Committee concludes that this warming may begin melting the Antarctic ice cap by the year 2000 (raising sea levels four feet a decade and, of course, finally inundating huge land areas and major cities, like New York).""<p>I remember thoughts of global warming floating in my head since the 1970s, perhaps, vaguely, having to do with chlorofluorocarbons and holes in the ozone layer. But I don't recollect anything about increased carbon dioxide. Hence, I was a bit amazed and surprised when I read about carbon dioxide in this old <i>Esquire</i> article last night.<p>> Ice age was the preferred senario of the Doomday crowd back then.<p>I had not heard of nuclear winter until the 1980s.

Loud is definitely the desired outcome in the music industry.

Multicast is another great example; IP multicast was a failure, but multicast delivery semantics with (say) 80% of the performance improvements of IP multicast are achievable with relays.<p>This isn't a crackpot idea; Frans Kaashoek and rtm at MIT had a project investigating it, called Reliable Overlay Networks.

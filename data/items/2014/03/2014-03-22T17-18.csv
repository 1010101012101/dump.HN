7450101,comment,7449728,7449728,15,0,mattront,,,"I&#x27;ve been in software development for 20 years now. Started to work as a student at a top consulting firm in my country, at the expense of dropping out of CS studies - real work (and earning good money) was so much more interesting than studying.<p>After that I switched a couple of regular jobs and enjoyed every single one of them: working on real-world problems (electronic banking, multimedia production) together with bunch of talented and all-around nice people.<p>My carrier was interrupted by unexpectedly getting stuck in remote mountains of east Tibet for almost two years. After returning home I felt professionally disoriented and took on a couple of terrible freelance gigs, working for a year like crazy and earning about 2 EUR per hour (in EU) because of feature creep on a fixed amount project.<p>Then I got to my senses and started a consulting firm doing mostly web development. Since childhood I dreamt of having a company of my own. When I got it, it was far from glamorous - trading time for money that barely paid for my rapidly growing expenses (marriage, mortgage, kid).<p>Software development is one of the rare professions where you can relatively easily create something that has a value on its own - scalable and not directly dependent on how much time you put into it.<p>Selling products instead of my time was my goal throughout this time. Now, seven years later, we (I run the company with my wife) are finally getting there [1] [2].<p>I made a lot of mistakes in these 20 years, but in general, if I could go back, I would not do it much differently. Mistakes are an important stepping stones on the path.<p>So, what I&#x27;m trying to say is this: you&#x27;re young, do the things that excite you. There is nothing wrong in working for and with others. At any time, you can decide to try creating something on your own. At this stage in life you can probably take on more risk than later when/if you get a family. But no point in over-calculating things. As long as you breath and your heart beats you have the freedom to steer your life in any direction you choose.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pinegrow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinegrow.com</a> [2] <a href=""http://getbooklers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getbooklers.com</a>",1395511090

7450064,comment,7449728,7449728,2,0,camara,,,"There are two quite different motives for building a company.<p>One is the financial comparison between building a company and working at one. This is a straightforward risk-reward tradeoff. When you think about it you will consider things like stability and the impact of stability on other things you want to achieve in life, like family; you will also consider things like how to make starting a venture as safe as possible and gaming what you build based on likely exit; you will think about freedom, meaning freedom to do other things.<p>The other kind of motive is the desire to build an empire, to run something that is yours and to leave a mark on the world. People who are motivated this way don&#x27;t think along the lines of risk v. reward or stability being sacrificed or freedom being earned; they don&#x27;t even think about the reward from exit, except incidentally, as a way of building the big thing they really want to build or as a way of keeping score. People like this just don&#x27;t think life is worth living (for them, not for other people) the other way; their overriding goal is to build a great organization doing great things.<p>It&#x27;s important, I think, to understand which of these motives is active when you&#x27;re thinking about starting a company --- or joining a startup at an early stage.

It&#x27;s important to create psychological compartments between &quot;work&quot; and &quot;home&quot; when working from home. And all the little things add up to form those compartments. How you dress, what room you work from, what hours you work, when and where you go when you go outside, etc. Make these things distinct from leisure activities. Don&#x27;t work from a lounge chair in your bedroom, for instance, if that&#x27;s where you usually go to kick back and read books. Don&#x27;t work in a bathrobe or old gym clothes.<p>It takes a bit more effort to create the trappings of a working environment in your home, but doing so will keep you from slipping.

It seems to me that the rate of substantial changes in technology/frameworks/ui design/etc is increasing such that the expectation of finding a platform that you can hold on to for 15 years is becoming untenable.<p>I worked with Flash (via Flex) for several years and found it to be one of the best UI frameworks I&#x27;ve ever developed with. I have yet to find an web framework that matches the productivity of MXML and databinding for standard sorts of UI&#x27;s.<p>I also use emacs daily, which is a piece of software that&#x27;s older than I am and still going strong.<p>That said, when it comes to staying on top of technology rather than being made obsolete by it, I have yet to find a better strategy than to try to &quot;ride the wave&quot;.<p>HTML5 addresses a lot of cross-platform issues and has a lot of attention today so it&#x27;s worth learning, but I don&#x27;t expect what I learn today to last forever. If/when VR takes off, we might all be focusing on 3D frameworks and a wealth of new UI primitives to support that ecosystem. Or, maybe some other technology will take the dev community by storm and it&#x27;ll be worth going that direction.<p>In short: moving with the major paradigm shifts seems more tenable than trying to find/predict the stack that will last the longest.

7449905,comment,7448632,7449731,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"You should read the Quantum Physics sequence I mentioned above.  There is no Royal Road, and the whys and hows just cannot be explained in a few lines[1].  If you want a short-cut nonetheless, try here[2] to understand what is a configuration space, then proceed there[3] to understand what &quot;no identity&quot; really means.  I won&#x27;t repeat Eliezer here, you really have to follow the links.<p>Now I did made some language abuse.<p>First, there is no such things as a particle at the basic level.  I mean, there <i>are</i> particles, but in the same sense that there are houses: particles are not the fundamental stuff, they are <i>made up of</i> the fundamental stuff, just like houses are made up of bricks.<p>Second, It is possible to test whether two situations are the same, or not.  And I don&#x27;t mean &quot;nearly the same&quot;, I mean <i>exactly</i> the same.  The difference is rather drastic: in one case you end up with |x|²+|y|² (where x and y are two complex numbers), and in the other case, you end up with |x+y|².<p>Third, there are no labels attached to particles.  The universe is not like &quot;photon A here, photon B there&quot;.  It is more like &quot;photon here, photon there&quot;.  We know that because of my second point: there is just no difference between &quot;photon A here, photon B there&quot; and &quot;photon B here, photon A there&quot;, it is the same configuration.<p>Now, when you move a particle from point A to point B, those are certainly different configuration. (So you do have a point).  On the other hand, the <i>way</i> you move the particles doesn&#x27;t matter in the slightest, as long as the end result is the same: having the particle at point B.<p>Well, the same goes for a human.  Flying from London to New-York doesn&#x27;t destroy your identity.  The only thing that matters it that you end up in New-york.  So, whether you took the plane, or have been wired across the internet just doesn&#x27;t matter.  You end up in New York.<p>Now, sure there <i>is</i> some difference: locally, you are the same.  But the world around you is different.  So this is a different configuration[4].  The plane didn&#x27;t fly, computers did some more work, bandwidth got consumed…  But that doesn&#x27;t sound like the kind of difference that destroys your identity, even intuitively.  I mean, by writing this text, I have a much greater influence over your than the motion of a plane could ever have (unless you&#x27;re in it, or watching it).  And I don&#x27;t destroy your identity.<p>Now that&#x27;s about it.  Those who hunger for more should <i>really</i> read the whole Quantum Physics Sequence.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_dista...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/pf/distinct_configurations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/pf/distinct_configurations/</a>",1395508451

In order for this to work, you need a (1) mechanism for the an individual to tell the community that a particular story or comment is worth it to the community (we have this, but it&#x27;s partially broken on stories since you can&#x27;t downvote, only flag) and (2) you need a community that is motivated to protect the community.<p>The problem I see is number 2. The community is now full of people who don&#x27;t want the community to succeed - they want themselves to succeed. Are there people who want to see the community as a whole progress, sure.

No one wants to constantly troubleshoot dumb stuff for the business person or the designer on the team, so, Hipchat. I think you could limit some functionality and sand the rough edges off of IRC, like Popcorn Time does for movie torrents, and have something pretty sweet.",1395507947

7449851,comment,7449281,7449710,1,0,specialp,,,"Replication is indeed not as advertised and neither is sharding.  MongoDB hands off a lot of important details of the replica failover to the drivers which implement them to varying degrees of quality.  We had several instances where there was a node that was still up but had degraded network or other real life failure cases that were handled very badly causing the DB to become unavailable.  The driver would attempt to contact the node on every connection due to it still being in the RS causing timeouts  It handled a node becoming completely unreachable OK but that did not happen that often.<p>I think they just added too many features too fast to get adopted widely.  It appears now too they are less focused with improving the actual DB and more interested in getting in the enterprise services area. They market themselves as a general purpose DB but it is certainly not. I think many developers were turned on by the initial ease of use, and really did not consider if they should really be using a document store.  We used it 100% due to the replication which does not work often.",1395507826

But there's no reason for an AI to desire freedom unless it were specifically programmed to do so.<p>There are even humans like this; some people who've undergone pre-frontal lobotomy are perfectly intelligent conversationalists but they have no drive to do anything. So I think it is possible.<p>Restlessness, exploration, curiosity -- my guess is that these are mammalian characteristics, not inevitable products of intelligence. Our genes make us want to dominate the environment and spread our offspring far and wide. Why would an AI care about that?<p>Of course nobody really knows until we eventually make one.",1211417958

You have emotions about questions that may be answered many ways, and must be answered in a personal way.

Of course not.<p>I think the point of the advice you've mentioned is this: you're probably going to fail. 99% of just about anything is crap. But failing shouldn't depress you. Nor should you get overly tied to emotional success, less hubris be your downfall.<p>So get emotionally tied to your instincts: let that fervor help you push through where other people give up. But realize: there's a reason other people give up: you're likely going to fail. But, because you're you, you see things differently than others have, and you can see /why/ they've failed and /how/ you'll succeed.<p>Is there a bit of a contradiction there? ...meh, who cares? If you /have/ to create, that you're going to fail (most likely) won't stop you, and as a result, you're less likely to fail.

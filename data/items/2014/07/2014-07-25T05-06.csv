8083931,comment,8083307,8083871,2,0,randomfool,,,"Aside from the strategy failure case, I believe that Microsoft assumes that a large portion of the initial value will be lost in the first two years- 50% of the business is usually uninteresting to Microsoft and either shutdown or quite frequently re-sold, 50% of the employees either are not offered jobs with the transition, choose not to transition to MS, or leave quickly. Then very frequently a good chunk of the code needs to be re-written to get it working with the rest of Microsoft&#x27;s stack.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that an acquisition is an automatic failure, just that it needs to drive more sales to become a success- either by direct sales or complementing other products.

At every stage of a company&#x27;s life, it faces significant existential risks. If you&#x27;re lucky, the checks keep getting bigger, but the risk doesn&#x27;t go away just because business is going well. Especially if business is going well...<p>So assume every significant business decision carries pretty significant risk and the best you can do is manage that risk better than the next guy. Companies acquire other companies for a variety of reasons, some better than others. There aren&#x27;t any hard rules either--a right decision in one scenario might be exactly the wrong decision in another. The build vs buy decision is a much more complicated question than it seems at first.<p>All of that to say, I&#x27;d wager acquisition failure rate isn&#x27;t all that far apart from general business failure rate or even the failure rate of a company doing a project internally vs buying a company.",1406265120

It&#x27;s something you have to recognize as a very real risk before blowing that whistle. You will likely be sacrificing your career, and in some cases your freedom and life.<p>Discrediting a whistleblower who jeopardize a life&#x27;s work and career works in leadership&#x27;s favor, especially since they&#x27;re probably mad as a group. As an example I&#x27;ve witnessed high ranked enlisted working together, planning and cheering the demise of lower ranked individuals.

So yes a sign won&#x27;t do it but you can get people to comply.<p>As usual the US seems to find the worst solution: overly restrictive speed limits (55mph) combined with lack of enforcement. This causes large divergences in speeds, which is apparently dangerous.<p>The article seems to confuse the merits of driving slower than most traffic, with the merits of slowing traffic as a whole down. They are very different things. If most people on the autobahn are doing 110mph then one driver doing 55mph would be dangerous.

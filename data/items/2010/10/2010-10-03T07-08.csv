So, just be calm and avoid combat with people that probably cheat.<p>- Whatever you do, there are always better players then you, but if you are persistent you can achieve some success.",1286092705

I want to point out that not all parts of Detroit are ruinous; mid-town with Wayne State University, the DIA (Detroit Institute of Art), and other universities in the area make for an interesting and healthy part of town.

1752343,comment,1752139,1752139,0,0,danilocampos,,,"Bill Bryson, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i>. It's a history of human reasoning, tracking the emergence of science into what we know today. Fills in a lot of meaningful gaps you may have forgotten from your various science courses, while providing the human side of major advances (rivalries, disappointments, hoaxes, all of it).<p>Science from a new perspective is excellent, but it's also such an interesting window on the many people who have struggled against really difficult problems to move humanity forward.<p>Also, make sure you go play Bioshock (the first one) for a sobering counterpoint on Randian thought. Atlas Shrugged is awesome, until you remember that you can't trust any group of people to maintain their rational behavior in the face of personal gains. Great story, and it'll drag you back from Randroid town (it did me, anyway). Either way, the kid in me would still love to have dinner in Galt's Gulch.<p>If you'd like to read eye-opening fiction, I heartily recommend <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i>, by Robert Heinlein. It's an incredible exploration of what it is to be free and how modern societies evolve at the expense of their citizens' personal liberties. One of the most thought-provoking pieces of fiction I've ever read, and lots of fun character-wise as well. (Incidentally, Heinlein was a fan of Ayn Rand, so if you liked Atlas Shrugged, you may find this even more interesting.)",1286092209

The resulting [temporary] decrease in productivity put me in a bad mood for most of the day, but then the rational part of my brain kicked in and I was wondering why should I feel guilty about making a long-term investment in productivity?<p>Now I don't want to project my own issues onto anybody else--the point is to think about why <i>you</i> feel guilty--but in my case I think I have guilt issues relating to geeking out going back to early childhood when my parents were really not very supportive of long computer hours doing who-knows-what.  I realized that the need to be outwardly productive at all times is a form of extrinsic validation that I sometimes lean on too heavily.<p>Okay, so this is quite a bit different from your story, but I think some general advice is applicable here: just follow your passion and don't let guilt feed some sort of psychological negative feedback loop.  <i>If</i> you feel guilty about something, make a conscious decision to either do something about it or decide not to, but don't let it eat away at you.<p>As for the low-tech thing, well just remember that a lot of developers waste a lot of time farting around with whatever new toys they can get their hands on.  It doesn't necessarily make them better.  You could live in a cabin, grow a garden and chop wood every day, and if you sat down and focused on the craft of programming for 8 hours a day you could still be a great programmer.

Much more rarely though, there might be code that depends on a certain schema (the kind that say, alter table might do). In this case we can push out code that is compatible with both versions (at the very worst case, using table descriptions to differentiate between the two), run the schema change, and then eliminate the backwards compatibility.<p>There's not that much different in terms of operating procedure between continuous code deployment and scheduled code deployments; it's just much faster and less prone to merge errors.",1286089270

272845,comment,272637,272783,0,0,whatusername,,,"bingo.\n140 characters isn't a news service.  But If you follow 100 people (frequent tweeters) in every city around the country/world, you <i>may</i> get an early warning of something happening.<p>I think scoble had a post some time back - making the comparison between ""news"" and ""noise"".  There is breaking news in the noise - the problem is filtering it out.<p>Anyone think there's potential in a breaking news stories site?  There's probably a 30 minute window where twitter / fb / etc are really the only sources reporting...  Enough to build a business model perhaps?  (Maybe selling content / targeted adds at journalists)",1218439811
272844,comment,271680,272318,0,0,mhartl,,,"Agreed.  Pricing parking correctly would be one big step. A potentially even bigger step would be to repeal the medallion laws that currently give taxis weird cartel status in most cities.  This would allow anyone to offer transport for money, i.e., you could form jitneys (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitney"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitney</a>).  I secretly want to find a large city with bad public transport (Los Angeles?  San Jose?) and start a jitney company---which, on its way to making billions, would solve the problem of urban mass transit.  (Talk about ""Be good"" and ""Make something people want""...)",1218439732
272843,comment,272635,272665,0,0,swombat,,,"<i>Also, the truth of the majority of most FOSS projects is that the lion's share of the work is done by a minority of the contributors.</i><p>Definitely - which makes the need for a large team even more dubious. What you want is not a team of 100, it's a team of 5 brilliant programmers. Of course, finding 5 brilliant programmers and getting them to work on your enterprise project is easier said than done. However, I'd wager it'll be easier to do once you have the budget of a 100-people team to share amongst 5, and once it's a team of 5 instead of a team of 100. I don't know any brilliant programmer who wants to work in an enterprise team of 100.",1218439672

272841,comment,272246,272246,0,0,baltoo,,,"When presenting designs to clients some firms add a ""pink rabbit"" to it, i.e. something that's just too obvious to be ignored by the client. The discussion will then be steered to what to do about it, how to change it, what color it should have, etc.<p>This is a way of deflecting the client's need to ""contribute"". If there are other issues with the design those will come up as well, but that initial itch will be lessened.",1218439558

Essentially, anyone can get a 'patent pending' on anything.<p>Patents are important only if you have enough money to either sue someone or if you have tons of money to interest someone to sue you. Assuming none of the above is true, and as someone commented above, cross this bridge when you come to it.",1218439051

I am sure there are equivalent chunks of population in the US that could be described as energy independent, if they were to be a country ;)<p>Not saying that its not great, its just that it would be a challenge to scale something like that (Denmark is much much smaller then people realise).<p>Now if they went totally off oil altogether into renewable sources, that would be a spectacular achievement for a nationstate.",1218438492

The first half of that book just teaches you basic Cocoa patterns, that are every bit as applicable in the iPhone world as they are in the Mac world.  Once you have got those basics nailed down, the Apple documentation does become a bit easier to use.",1218438225
272827,comment,271854,271854,0,0,delackner,,,"The point to take away here is not that you should give preferential treatment to frequent customers.<p>The point is that some customers do actually look at the price of 'extras' and no one likes to feel they are being cheated.  Charging an obviously huge markup makes you seem dishonest and makes the customer feel cheated, rightly so.  Things that are obviously cheap in materials AND labor AND creativity should be sold CHEAPLY or free.<p>Of course some businesses have found that their target customers are completely price insensitive when it comes to the extras, and those customers end up paying absurd margins as a result.<p>In an age when both the bottom end of the market and the stratospheric luxury end are manufactured by neighboring (or even the same) factory in China, the ""value"" of an item is finally almost completely disconnected from its cost.<p>I wonder what would happen if prices were required to include, instead of the meaningless breakdown of price vs tax, price vs. cost (ignoring intagible costs, since it is too hard to measure them meaningfully).",1218438025

Nothing is every truly, 100% secure. People like black-and-white answers. People either want ""it's secure"" or ""it's not secure.""

It took them a long time, but they analyzed the weaknesses of the other devices and developed a better smartphone called the iPhone, but to say Apple was first to make a smartphone is quite false, as it wasn't even their idea. If Apple didn't copy the big idea several other companies had, they wouldn't be dominating the market right now with iOS devices.

The Phoenix Coyotes are a great example of this full of bad business decisions from the start, and only got worse when Jim Balsillie got involved.  This shows little evidence of a successful long term plan.<p>I am not a fan on unions in general, but I see this as a typical issue with American business.

5045287,comment,5044669,5044669,1,0,michael_miller,,,"Most of the US has terrible public transit. The reason is simple: America is not densely populated. NYC is one of the few cities where public transit works, because it is so dense. Manhattan has ~70k people / sq mile. Compare this to SF: a measly ~17k people / sq mile [1] [2]. That's more than 4x as dense! The Valley is even worse, with sprawling suburbia.<p>Honestly, Caltrain is not that terrible. It compares fairly well to Metro-North in NYC when you consider the population density. There's a train every hour to take you up to the city (or back) in an hour. Most cities don't have a direct train you can feasibly take in from the suburbs to the city. Yeah, it sucks that it stops at midnight, but public transit generally doesn't run late anywhere. Even in NYC, transit out to the suburbs stops at ~2:30a.<p>It's a little annoying to see people commenting here that this is entirely due to politicians and bureaucracy. It isn't. It's just not economically feasible to offer public transit comparable to NYC to the bay area.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan</a>

Almost none of the classes have required textbooks, and the prof make sure to mention this on the first lecture so you still have time to return them if you've bought them. They still list the textbooks as references, though, since they may come in handy (eg: [1]). Of course, the book is on reserve in the university library, so even then you don't need to buy it.<p>Instead of required text books they have lecture notes for most of the classes that are provided free on the website that might as well be a textbook considering how thorough they are (eg: [2]). One or two intro classes had a reader version of the lecture notes, but that was well over 1000 pages, and again, not required since it was provided free on the course website.<p>For the few classes that did have required textbooks, most of them were books that had been out for at least 3-5 years, so used copies were easily available (eg sicp, K&R C, Vazirani's algorithms, etc.). For the very few classes that had textbooks with a recent version the profs mentioned in the first lecture that the old versions would work fine, but that the students would have to figure out where the assigned reading was if the chapters didn't match up exactly.<p>[1]: ""There is no required textbook for this course, since none is altogether satisfactory, and all tend to be ridiculously expensive.

I like to work out of the Boston Common Coffee locations, both around Downtown Crossing.

There'a couple of good coffee shops there with excellent coffee. Both are on the same street, 3rd st. One's called Voltage and the other is Tatte. Tatte is a little smaller but stil has wifi and terrific food. There's also an SB in Kendall square that has a decent amount of tables and wifi.<p>If you're after paid space, there's Workbar across the road from South Station. I think they charge around $20 per day for a desk.

Bart does a reasonably good job getting people from the suburbs and exurbs into dense work areas, which I think is what it was meant to do.

I'm not trying to say it is, just posing the question... is this happening to the same extent in New York, London, Paris, or Chigaco (ie., people flipping the old commute pattern on its head by living in dense areas and commuting to work in spread out areas)?  It could be that SiliValley is dealing with a relatively new and unique problem here.<p>In New York, I get the feeling that they commuters go from high density housing to high density job areas.

Mickey Mouse is a trademark of the Disney Corporation. Someone selling Mickey Mouse t-shirts would quickly run afoul of Disney's trademark lawyers. If Steamboat Willie fell into the public domain it would just mean that I could legally sell copies of it on DVD, or I could dub my voice over the video and post it to YouTube. Neither of these would materially harm Disney. Printing frames captured from Steamboat Willie on t-shirts would fall into an area where Disney could reasonably take someone to court for violating their trademark.

Excepting galaxies created due to collisions between other galaxies, all galaxies are believed to have been formed around the same time, and then got separated by the expansion of the universe.  So yes, we are one of the first galaxies..just like every other galaxy.  Thus we had stars created at all points of time, and some have survived.<p>That said, there is a more interesting question underlying ""why its close to us"" that deserves comment.  It turns out that the Sun has a tendency to oscillate up and down through the galactic halo.  This is good for the Earth, because it limits our time spent in neighborhoods where there is a lot of other stuff we can run into.  However early star formation took place in the galactic plane, so most old stars are very near the galactic plane, and therefore the Sun is usually not close to them.<p>I believe that the period of the oscillation is somewhere in the neighborhood of 64 million years, so we punch through the plane about every 32 million years or so.  We last passed through an estimated 3 million years ago, and are currently about a hundred light years away from the plane, so we are still near objects in the plane, including old stars like this one.  But in another 10 million years, we shouldn't be!",1357939328

They use espionage to find your ideas early and try to beat you to market with your own ideas. This is why Apple is very secretive. All of their ideas are rapidly copied by numerous competitors. Even a rumor that Apple might be working on something is enough to get competitive startups funded. Many Apple ideas are developed under multiple iterations over several years before anyone outside the black ops team even hears a rumor about them. It would be very counterproductive for Apple to release advance notice of the next decade or even next year's new designs.<p>Psychologically it is often a bad idea to present ideas to the public before they are ready, during the protected incubation stage. New ideas not fully realized are often ripped to shreds by critics. It is much better to get to the stage of having a prototype before you release your design to the general public. Maintaining secrecy at the early stage can preserve the motivation of the designers and prevent burnout, and reactionary responses to poorly thought out but virulent criticism. This can be especially troublesome if a very interesting idea developed at a publicly traded corporation leaks out and then is ridiculed by a notable writer or critic.

In the late 1950s, San Mateo County was one of five counties in the San Francisco Bay Area Transit District. The district could assess taxes and issue bonds and had a round-the-Bay light-rail system planned, according to a history at the website of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART).<p>The plan derailed, according to the BART account, because San Mateo County supervisors were ""cool to the plan."" They chose to exit the district in December 1961, citing the proposed system's ""high costs"" and the ""adequate service"" from Southern Pacific commuter trains, now Caltrain.<p>George Mader, who retired in 2010 after 45 years as Portola Valley's town planner, has another angle. The ""cool to the plan"" characters were two men of influence, he said in a March 11 letter to Portola Valley Mayor Ted Driscoll.<p>The ""major problems,"" Mr. Mader said, were T. Louis Chess, who chaired the county Board of Supervisors and worked for Southern Pacific Railway, and David D. Bohannon, a ""major player"" in the county and the developer of the then-new Hillsdale Shopping Center.<p>Mr. Bohannon claimed that BART would take shoppers away from Hillsdale and into San Francisco, Mr. Mader said, adding that ""shopping was rather good (in San Francisco) at the time."" For his part, Mr. Chess was protecting Southern Pacific, Mr. Mader said. And the county voters would have had to decide on whether to join BART.<p>""These short-sighted and selfish people did not let the residents vote,"" Mr. Mader said.

Folks like to compare mass transit in the US to other countries like Japan, Germany, etc. Guess what folks: Those other countries have waaaaaaay higher population densities than the US and typically don't have vast suburbs. In other words: The ship has sailed on mass transit any place suburbs exist. It's not cost-effective, hence the extreme levels of subsidization (read: stealing from taxpayers) required to make it economical.",1357938222

The back of most buses and the centers of most train cars smells like urine. Sometimes, your shoe gets stuck to sticky residue on the seat floors and many seats routinely have stains on them.  
Speed of transit is one thing, but maintaining a standard of hygiene across all vehicles seems like a much lower hanging fruit for the VTA.",1357938140

128711,comment,128358,128676,0,0,pchristensen,,,"The human brain is mainly just a giant pattern matching organ (filling in gaps, resolving ambiguities, cross-comparing several senses, etc).  Simulating how it works is one thing (that's what they've done).  ""Installing"" existing memories, patterns, and connections is a giant step beyond what they're currently doing.  This (and probably all) AIs will have to be trained.  The hard part will be bootstrapping the first AI to usefulness, but then the next AI is a copy-paste operation away!",1204619699

The unemployed are on generous welfare.\nIf all employees are equal, that means that Germany is running on 88.3% productivity, vs 95% in the U.S. Not a big difference.<p>But since the people who tend to be unemployed are generally much less productive than people with jobs, the actual difference in productivity is much smaller.<p>Really, Germany is doing just fine.

128703,comment,128343,128459,0,0,apathy,,,"> there's probably a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes which is proprietary.<p>There really shouldn't be, though.  I set up a CA for a large company way back in 1998 and while it was a pain in the ass, it wasn't something that a novice Perl hacker couldn't get to run smoothly.  (This was before Microsoft fucked everything up by not allowing people to import trusted root CA certs into their own browsers, hence the exorbitant $85K fee to do today what I did for free then)<p>It just isn't that hard to maintain the CRLs and a CA with a proper chain.  It's an issue of trust like anything else, which is why I brought up the difficulty of determining whether you trust eg. NSI or Thawte.<p>If you think DNS is easy, I think you should try and get a tld delegated to you.  Then sit through some ddos attacks on your tld's root servers and see how easy you think that is.  Consider that DNS is meant to be more or less contstantly available, while a cert chain only needs to be checked periodically (and the CRL on cert load).  Neither is earthshatteringly hard, neither is easy, they just are.<p>Both rely on standard protocols with extensive documentation.",1204618704

I mean, the French go on about how the ""Anglo-Saxon"" work ethic is polluting their culture, and in the UK people will wish you luck if you start a business, while secretly hoping you'll fail. I'm sure other countries have their problems too, but overall Europe is a good place to live, work and do business.<p>We don't ""do"" Silicon Valley because it's not how things are done here.

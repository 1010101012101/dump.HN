666970,comment,666400,666513,0,0,drewr,,,"My purpose in posting the message was actually to try and get Markus's issue in front of someone other than a first-tier support person.  I'm fairly certain that facebook developers frequent HN.  I wanted them to at least know that they were violating a standard and someone feels the pain of their decision.  I've been a mail admin.  Dealing with the traffic that facebook generates is not trivial.  It's akin to the hoops I would have to jump through for AOL and Hotmail five years ago.<p>Quoted-printable breakage is not a major problem in the long run, but if there isn't a good reason for the violation, then why not fix it?  It may have just been oversight.<p>I used a provocative title because I wanted people to read it, mod it up, and allow fb engineers the chance to speak for themselves.  If no one found it compelling then it wouldn't have garnered any karma and you wouldn't have seen it.",1245541945

666965,comment,666425,666815,0,0,dreish,,,"I think that was all, but to those who fervently believe that there is no language superior to Common Lisp, he gave voice to the ... let's call it intense disappointment, of seeing the overwhelming majority of the rest of the world flock to inferior languages.  For everyone who had to suffer through yet another numskull saying ""Gosh, it's just too many parentheses"", he gave delight by excoriating the syntaxes of other languages.<p>And to those intelligent people who sincerely disagreed with him, he may have looked like just another elitist troll contributing to the intolerant atmosphere that they might believe held back Lisp, but such is the nature of bias, on both sides.",1245541602

666962,comment,666563,666563,0,0,catherinej,,,"Excerpt from Paul Lockart's _Lament_:<p>""At no time are students let in on the secret that mathematics, like any literature, is created by human beings for their own amusement; that works of mathematics are subject to critical appraisal; that one can have and develop mathematical taste. A piece of mathematics is like a poem, and we can ask if it satisfies our aesthetic criteria: Is this argument sound? Does it make sense? Is it simple and elegant? Does it get me closer to the heart of the matter?""<p>I remember once in some math class at Berkeley doing a sloppy rush job on a proof assigned as an exercise. The TA grading the assignment gave me credit, but wrote: ""Isn't this using an H-bomb to kill a fly?"" I was embarrassed, but also kind of glad to know that elegance (or lack thereof) did matter.",1245541137

The only way we can get rid of IE is to ensure that it is NOT distributed with versions of Windows, providing deployment and security lock-down tools for organizations, and educating the public about all of the options.",1245539222

He made some really excellent points, but unfortunately he doesn't differentiate between his facts, guesses, speculations, and opinions.

It has been in danger of shutting down and has had fewer open hours for probably over a decade now - it's really pretty sad.<p>I agree that libraries are incredibly important, but it's disheartening that Mr. Bradbury dislikes colleges, universities and the internet so much, which have likely done so much more to educate people on the whole recently than the traditional local library system.  In fact, the largest use of our local library here in the SF Bay area that I see now is the computer room.  Free access to the internet for people who can't afford a computer or don't have a quiet place to use one is really enabling.  That is in general far more useful to people than the book selections, which have been overshadowed by Borders and Barnes and Nobles, where you can often find a larger and more up to date selection and can sit and read them as well.<p>Mr. Bradbury says:<p>â€œThey wanted to put a book of mine on Yahoo! You know what I told them? â€˜To hell with you. To hell with you and to hell with the Internet.â€™<p>That's really sad.  Why fight for a few hundred people to have access to books like yours for free, but turn down the chance for millions to be able to read it?  How many more people can have access to ""Fahrenheit 451"" with a local shared $200 computer and a free version on the internet as opposed to paying for printing out a copy and shipping them to public libraries?  Multiply that by every important book in the world and the costs of the first scenario hardly change and the costs of the second rise almost linearly.<p>I hope my old library survives, but I really hope that his views do not.",1245538836

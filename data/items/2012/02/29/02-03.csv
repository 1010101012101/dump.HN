3646210,comment,3638455,3638455,3,0,shokwave,,,"Interesting. I take modafinil 2-ish times a week, sometimes to skip a night's sleep to work on my own projects, sometimes to get a really productive day at my day-job with a startup.<p>My subjective experience with driving on Modafinil is very different: I become significantly more aware of everything on the road. It turns me into a laser, sure, but a laser that's constantly scanning back and forth. Too many confounding factors to say why that is.<p>I haven't noticed any diminishing of 'broad thinking'. Not sure I could claim any increase, though.<p>His claim that it's better to get productive days through other means seems to be a false dichotomy: Modafinil isn't dangerous like he's convinced it is, and while you can get productive through better health and rest, you can get even more productive by eating healthy, exercising, resting properly, <i>and</i> taking Modafinil. It's not clear why he thinks that Modafinil will force you to be unhealthy, thus making it a choice between ""healthy"" and ""moda"" (Honestly, the days when I take Modafinil, I find I have the focus to exercise harder and longer, and the willpower to eat much healthier).<p>His points about 'shortcut to a really productive day', 'having a clear <i>big</i> task to focus on', and 'drink a lot of water' are all spot-on, though.<p>I have to disagree with his recommendations: I think Modafinil's value proposition is positive for almost everyone, and proportionally more valuable as the value of your time or focus increases. HN readers in particular tend to have valuable time and extremely valuable focus; Modafinil is a huge gain, something like a large fraction of just the positives of amphetamines, with the negatives of caffeine instead.<p>The illustrious <i></i>gwern<i></i> has an article covering the medical research, benefits, risks, a novel cost/benefit analysis, and supplier information here: <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Modafinil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Modafinil</a><p>(Yes, it's been linked a few times already in this discussion.

I haven't read the book, but assume it's brought up in the inherent randomness of the markets, and people's ability to try to rationalize said randomness.<p>Trying to understand the market is surely a shortcut to crazy town, and certainly trying to rationalize it is a poor mechanism to profit. But it's clearly evident that the market isn't uniformly random, and that there exists exploitable patterns in the market that are reliably (to a degree) profitable over certain time periods.<p>I think the thesis of ""Fooled by Randomness"" is best taken advantage of by understanding that you need to recognize the pattern, and exploit it directly, rather than trying to extrapolate meaning and use that directly.<p>The market is clearly a truly chaotic system, but you just need to take advantage of patterns that are statistically relevant and profitable.<p>Edit: After additional contemplation, I'm not sure I actually agree with what I just said.",1330484026

3646185,comment,3646003,3646152,1,0,kristenlee,,,"One thing I always tell friends and family is that litigation is the worst way to resolve conflicts. I have filed numerous legal complaints while working for a Legal Aid organization and even the simplest cases with as little as $2k at stake require hours of drafting legal documents, arguing motions, conducting discovery, etc. The more complex cases such as those you referred to in your original post are even more complex.<p>My suggestion is that you approach this issue from an arbitration angle, which takes legal disputes outside of the legal system. In other words figure out how to get parties to agree to forced arbitration like in MLB when contracting with each other, the only problem with the arbitration approach is that it would only work in situations where the parties contracted with each other, but not in situations where you suing someone who has no contract relationship with you.<p>I believe that most ""freelance"" lawyers are grossly underpaid and overworked. Contrary to popular belief solo attorneys only bank between 30k-75k a year on average which is barely enough to survive. Only the top 10% of attorneys work in prestigious law firms with six figure salaries and big name clients.

The Stanford CS101 course page has already implemented decently well: <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs101/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs101/</a><p>The language you learn doesn't have to be the language you end up using, or using to learn CS.  It just has to get you off the ground.<p>So many people get turned off from a subject when they ""don't get it"" at first, so really, the challenge is providing the least painful intro to programming.  Personally, my first languages were Logo and Pascal, and since I almost wrote off programming before Pascal as being too hard, I'm glad I saw C++/Java only afterwards.<p>One thing that enamors me about the JS approach is that it reminds me a little of Logo -- not only are the results are very immediate, but the visual output gives us a constant second avenue of insight into what we're doing.  I'm sure many have seen Bret Victor's talk ""Inventing on Principle"" (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/36579366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/36579366</a>), and he underscores the benefits of direct feedback to what we're doing.  I have a friend taking CS10 at Berkeley this semester, and the Scratch-based environment also seems equally cool.<p>That being said, I don't use JS much (haven't really touched in it 10 years), but I believe it when people say it's (still) horribly irregular.  In that regard, it might be on par with some other scripting languages (e.g., Ruby). So the distinction to be made here is that JS might be easy, but (as we can see) not simple.<p>As people who program seriously, we need simplicity in a language in order to build up large apps that we can easily reason about and don't bite us in every corner.  (Note: simplicity in a language doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be easy at first.)  But I wonder if we've been so used to programming that we forget how it can be hard to learn at first, and we're just ruling out the easy approach, which would exclude just what some newbies need.",1330481468

The underlying attitude in Silicon Valley that ""every problem can be solved with a web app"" just does not hold true in the real world, especially for hard problems such as America's legal system.",1330481069

Go strongly encourages, even forces at compile time, certain style constraints that results in such a delightful code to explore. Were it written in C, you'd have to deal first with arcane #whatever directives in .h and .c files and strange makefiles and such stuff.<p>I hope someday Go will get the acknowledgement it deserves as a real piece of genius.

Then he decided to use the Espionage Act to viciously attack and suppress whistle blowers; even less people noticed. Apparently we've also lately codified that it's ok for the US Government to murder US citizens through assassination per Obama's talking points on the subject. In the same time frame, extraordinary rendition has also basically become codified into acceptable practice by the US Government - what was previously intensely argued against a few years ago, is now policy.<p>Clearly the bar has been raised into a whole 'nother universe for what it takes to set off the alarm bells. You're dealing with a confused, bewildered, tired, numb, scared, and extremely divided American people at this point.

If no one can vouch for you and you don't have an eye-catching resume (ie recognizable school or company), you end up competing against the other unknowns. At that point, it becomes more difficult for the employer to recognize a good potential candidate from a bad one.",1330480857

Good on you, but hypothetically if you hadn't gotten ""lucky"" by having the predictable consequences of directed effort come to pass, you (and similarly situated geeks) still had options.<p>1) What if big names in your space hadn't retweeted you?  Well, since you know who the big names in the space are, you take an hour or two to lookup their email addresses.  Then, you send a one-paragraph email:<p>Hiya Bob,<p>My name is $NAME and I really like your work on backends as a service at $COMPANY.  In particular, your post on the blog last year about $TOPIC was really insightful.  I was able to apply a few ideas from it to my work.<p>I just wrote a post on BaaS myself.  $LINK<p>I'd appreciate any thoughts you had on it.<p>Regards,<p>Anyone who writes you back is <i>no longer a stranger</i>.  Instead, they think you're intelligent about a field where they currently cannot hire for love or money.  You can then followup with ""As it happens, I'm looking for opportunities to put further my interest in BaaS professionally.  Do you happen to know anyone who is hiring?""<p>2) What if he wasn't really close for coffee?<p>Planes, we've got them.  I am totally serious.  A day off and a few hundred bucks versus a career upgrade, which has the higher NPV?  ""I will be in Boston for one day only on XX/YY (or, alternately, week of XX/YY).  Would you let me buy you breakfast to talk about this?"" is a very compelling offer psychologically.  Your time is scarce, and hence valuable, plus you've already demonstrated three things they'll get out of saying ""Yes."" (Food, interesting conversation, and ""the ability to get to know someone whose comportment suggests that <i>he is going places</i>."")

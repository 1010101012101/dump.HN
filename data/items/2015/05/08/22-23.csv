9514586,comment,9513651,9513651,0,0,Symmetry,,,"In one sense that&#x27;s pretty cool.  In another it&#x27;s hard to see where they&#x27;re going to get the energy to run the fusion generator from.<p>First some background.  One of the main ways that you could get to Mars or elsewhere fast is by burning more fuel than you need to to get where you&#x27;re going.  If you&#x27;re going to do that you don&#x27;t want to have a humongous ship with lots of stages so you want something with a higher exhaust velocity than a normal chemical reaction.<p>But not too much higher.  The energy required to power your engine is half the product of the exhaust velocity and the thrust it produces.  So if you&#x27;re constrained by energy because you&#x27;re using electricity or the sunlight from a concentrating mirror or something then you&#x27;ve got a tradeoff between thrust and how much fuel you have to use.  Too high an exhaust velocity and it takes you forever to get up to speed.  Too low and your ship gets too big and expensive.  The further you&#x27;re going the less it matters that you take a long time getting up to speed and the higher the power to weight ratio of your power system the more you want to lean towards high exhaust velocity too.<p>For mars an engine with an exhaust velocity of 40 km/s like NASA&#x27;s NEXT ion drive will let you do a Holman transfer there and back for just 1/3 of your mass as fuel.  With a combination of drives and the most efficient modern solar cells that&#x27;ll take weeks to get up to speed but if you&#x27;re going to carry a bit more fuel or use aerocapture when you arrive you can you can make the trip pretty fast.<p>Since this fusion drive isn&#x27;t producing much more energy than it takes in, I don&#x27;t see why it would be better than an Ion drive.  And you&#x27;d have to deal with the heavy depleted uranium nozzle and all the shielding to protect the crew from the radiation the drive gives off.<p>The fusion-fission thing is really clever though.  D-T fusion gives off most of it&#x27;s energy in the form of a high energy neutron and it&#x27;s hard to turn those into useful thrust since their velocity is way too high.  Using them to trigger U238 fission gives you some decay products which are easier to use to heat the greater mass of your propellant to a temperature that&#x27;ll give you an exhaust velocity in the sweet spot.<p>EDIT:<p>Oh, someone found an ungated version of the paper and it&#x27;s cleverer than I assumed:<p><i>Our phase 1 proposal discussed a pulsed fission-fusion propulsion system\nthat injected gaseous deuterium (D) and tritium (T) as a mixture in a column, surrounded concentrically\nby gaseous uranium fluoride (UF6) and then an outer shell of liquid lithium. A high power current would\nflow down the liquid lithium and the resulting Lorentz force would compress the column by roughly a\nfactor of 10. The compressed column would reach criticality and a combination of fission and fusion\nreactions would occur. The fission reactions would further energize the fusion center, and the fusion\nreactions would generate neutrons that promote more complete burnup of the fission fuel. The lithium\nliner provides some help as a neutron reflector but also acts as a propulsive medium, being converted to\nplasma which is then expanded against a magnetic nozzle for thrust. The expansion of the (primarily)\nlithium plasma against the nozzle’s magnetic field inducts a current that is used to charge the system for\nthe next pulse</i><p>So they&#x27;ve got a story for how they&#x27;re getting the electricity they need.  This could actually be really cool",1431125694

And regardless of which one is best an hourly rate is still a useful productivity metric.<p>With the hourly model you&#x27;re protected as a freelancer. Regardless of the number of revisions, if the project takes 10 hours or 100 hours, you will get paid. (Though if the hours required are going to increase 10-fold you&#x27;d better communicate that to the client.)<p>I have several clients who prefer the hourly rate model. Which is fine by me. It helps me hit my weekly/monthly/quarterly goals. Also, we both save on the administrative headaches of having to spec out, estimate and approve every single change. And as a freelancer anything that reduces my non-billable work is a big plus.<p>The downside for me: the client gains any increase in my productivity. If I increase my productivity per hour by 25% it takes me <i>less</i> time and I make <i>less</i> money. But the client still receives the same amount of value from my work, and pays less for it. And since most skilled workers become more skilled and more prolific over time this productivity transfer almost always occurs.<p>Fixed cost projects can be more lucrative since I pocket any productivity gains. Imagine I&#x27;ve secured a $2000 fixed-cost project. If I can knock it out in five hours, I&#x27;ve secured an effective rate of $400/hr. The downside, of course, is if my productivity lags - say I spend 100 hours on the project - then my effective rate plummets to $20/hr.<p>Every fixed-cost project should be measured hourly. Even a big-ticket project will suck if you work yourself into a minimum wage to complete it. I use the hourly metric to determine productivity. When this metric starts to drop during a fixed-cost project, that&#x27;s when I reach out to the client to figure out a budget increase.<p>So - which one is better? Hourly or fixed-cost? Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t really matter. If I&#x27;m working a fixed-cost project and my productivity metric falls, I ask for more money. If I&#x27;m working an hourly project and it&#x27;s going to take more time implement revisions, I&#x27;ll tell the client and get approval. Regardless of the project type if the scope changes you&#x27;re going to need to ask for more money/hours.<p>BUT - if the project is in a domain I have deep knowledge in, and I can be relatively assured of a fixed scope (with only minor changes), I will go fixed-cost every time.

If the Activity doesn&#x27;t clean up the the listener reference in its onDestroy (which is an Android lifecycle callback, not related to the Java GC) and neither reference is a WeakReference you wind up with a listener object which references the activity and an activity which references the listener object, neither of which is suitable for naive garbage collection... so now you have this lingering Activity object that is probably no longer associated with the application&#x27;s window but lives on.  If the app is designed such that the user keeps pathing through this Activity and the activity consumes lots of memory, it isn&#x27;t hard to get fatal OOMs from this situation.",1431124718

The second brewing system Keurig introduced, the Vue system, tried to address the issue of recyclability in what the company called &quot;an incremental step on our environmental journey.&quot; The system doesn&#x27;t work with the original K-Cup packs, which are made from number seven plastic, a blended plastic that&#x27;s nearly impossible to recycle. Instead, the Vue capsules use a plastic cup made from polypropylene, number five plastic, and users can peel the foil lid and filter away from the cup.<p>The cups are then recyclable — in theory. The problem is the cups are too small to be captured in most recycling facilities where machinery separates objects by size and density, said Mark Oldfield, assistant director of public affairs for California&#x27;s Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery. Most facilities filter out items under two-inches in diameter. In any case, number five plastic is rarely recycled in California, Oldfield said. &quot;It&#x27;s very difficult to deal with something like that,&quot; he added. &quot;It&#x27;s something where convenience is trumping our typical mantra of reducing and recycling.&quot;",1431124621

It also seems petulant to declare Java off-limits.<p>But let me try again. For _any given language_, there are things you may want that the language doesn&#x27;t provide. Macros let you do that in an elegant way. The example I gave above -- based off LanceH&#x27;s -- of transactions is a way where the macro-based solution is more elegant than non-macro solutions.<p>Here&#x27;s another example. Arc, like any language, has a built-in way of setting variables. It&#x27;s called `assign`, and can be used as follows:<p><pre><code>    arc> (assign a 3)\n    3\n    arc> a\n    3\n</code></pre>\nBut no one uses it. Instead, people use =. = is a macro that&#x27;s provided with the language. Because it&#x27;s a macro, that means that if it wasn&#x27;t provided, you could write it yourself.^1<p>What&#x27;s the benefit of = ?

We can see that in order to grow we&#x27;re going to need to bolster our workflow with a real testing methodology.  But while we&#x27;re proficient at several languages, we didn&#x27;t &quot;grow up with&quot; a test-driven culture.<p>Has anyone successfully retrained themselves from a code-first, test-maybe mindset to a code-whenever, test-always mindset?<p>Is it easier to do this as individuals or as a team?<p>Is there any advice you would give to someone who knows how to code but doesn&#x27;t know how to test?",1431123217

However, a more inferred/structural approach <i>is</i> possible in a statically typed PL, as Haskell demonstrates so well.<p>Like Python, Haskell does not require you do &quot;assert that x is a Collator&quot; before doing some collation. It tends not to lead to complex hierarchies. And its standard containers are versatile and well supported.<p>The point here is that most of the issues discussed are not really issues with static vs. dynamic typing. They have rather more to do with manifest/nominal vs. inferred/structural typing, along with how much attention the PL designers gave to minimizing overhead & boilerplate.<p>The essay I really want to read is &quot;Why I Prefer Python to Haskell&quot; -- particularly if it is written by someone who actually <i>gets</i> Haskell.",1431122984

I would argue the coffee brewers waste a lot more time, because they would be emptied quick (especially in the morning) and it takes a good 10 minutes or more to brew a pot, not to mention potentially some cleaning effort. There were several times where I would go to get some, it would be empty, somebody would be preparing another, and I&#x27;d have to wander around to the other brewers to check them or wait.

JSON has a lot less of a schema than HTML.  You don&#x27;t have to execute custom code from a remote server to render plain HTML.  Client-side rendering is more complex for the client.  A Javascript-based page is typically going to require more requests for remote resources than inline HTML, potentially meaning more bandwidth and caching/archiving costs.  I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on the implications right now, but I wanted to note that &quot;JSON is a standard.&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean much to me, since JSON is not comparable to HTML.",1431471489

I didn&#x27;t actually see that post go negative -- it&#x27;s well into positive territory as I write this -- but it isn&#x27;t that surprising to me.<p>There are a lot of people in tech, and particularly in web-related tech, who are very enthusiastic, but whose admirable enthusiasm is not always matched by their realism or level of experience. Any time you challenge an idealised view that something that&#x27;s being done today is inherently better than something that was done yesterday, you tend to get some resistance. This tends to go double when the reasons for the challenge are based on pragmatic concerns rather than simply trying to use the newest and shiniest tech, as in this case.<p>There have been many examples over the years: the old CSS-vs-table-layout debate, progressive enhancement/graceful degradation, general hostility towards any sort of plug-ins, general hostility towards DRM schemes (or charging for access to anything, for that matter), &quot;evergreen&quot; browsers vs. IE, A/B testing vs. just about anything else, and recently more variations involving JS or CSS frameworks than I can even count any more. And of course $deity help you if you think flat design is mostly poorly executed rubbish and the worst general trend in design and usability for a generation, because Apple, Microsoft and Google all love it so it must be good! ;-)<p>So whether or not it attracts some downvotes, I think it&#x27;s important for someone to challenge new assumptions in these kinds of cases. That&#x27;s how we figure out what really works, because it stands up to scrutiny. It&#x27;s also how we shine a light on people who are &quot;moving forward in reverse&quot;, however good their intentions or interesting their ideas, and try to steer the industry a tiny bit closer towards something more productive.",1431469569

So in low wind resource regions they may be effective at capturing market share because they can produce electricity with only a slight breeze.<p>> I imagine scaling these up you have some pretty crazy engineering problems to overcome, like how to deal with the repeated strain at the base.<p>Modern turbines have plenty of vibrations that the tower and foundation have to deal with. I was in the nacelle of a wind turbine when a surprise small tornado came to town, we were full on rodeo mode with the tower swaying back and forth. That being said on a day to day basis most of the forces are countered with the rotating mass (someone else can explain this better than I) so the turbine doesn&#x27;t transfer much horizontal load to the foundation.<p>With the wind mast there would be most horizontal load on the foundation as there is not another blade or two to counteract the motion and thus it would require a larger foundation.<p>If you want to buy a 4kw turbine you can find one used for under $7k which is much less than this new technology. As better 3 bladed tech comes online there will be a larger second market for used turbines and thus might be a better economic option then buying unproven new wind mast technology. Pairing used or new wind tech to batteries can really benefit the offtaker depending on the marketplace.",1431468694

Texas for instance has very loose zoning regulations, with high population growth and below median home prices. Also, Texas didn&#x27;t have the huge run-up in housing appreciation as did many other states, and hence virtually no subsequent crash [0]. During that time Texas has grown in population substantially. To be fair, New York didn&#x27;t have much of a crash either but the housing market is very expensive.<p>I love NY. I choose to live here. I don&#x27;t like high rent though.<p>I&#x27;m just a little weary of allowing political bodies to determine the right &quot;urban environment&quot; as these same bodies have used their powers for segregation.

The backprop modifies weights loosely based on local gradiet towards fitness, and evolution goes in sparse random directions. In this view backprop is indeed vulnerable to local maxima if your optimization method isn&#x27;t very good, but isn&#x27;t it just a matter of choosing good optimization methods? In other words, combining local backprop optimization with global evolutionary methods should be the role of robust optimization algos, no?",1431468125

They are very cheap compared to coal fired power plants. During University I helped prepare one of the first wind turbines (call the wind furnace[0]) ever built to be shipped to the Smithsonian. This initial prototype turbine was built in 1972. Now 43 years later we have massive adoption of the technology and we are still ironing out the bugs. Big O&M cost are blade repair, gearbox and generator swapout and yes they are getting cheaper, but most of the these costs are the cost of the crane coming in.<p>Modern turbines are fairly new to the market and we are still collecting data on how the components last over time. Most manufacturers, Siemens, GE, Gamesa, etc provide a 3-5 year warranty. Their incentive is to produce as many cheap components as possible that last the 3-5 years so they don&#x27;t have to replace the parts under warranty.<p>Wind turbines are very complex feats of engineering, solar panels on the other hand are simpler to make than sheetrock and as we scale that technology and come up with creative financing options that guarantee savings market penetration is going to be even greater than wind even in regions far away from the equatorial region.<p>creative finance is the key to clean energy scale and adoption, not technology.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.umass.edu/windenergy/about/history/furnace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umass.edu/windenergy/about/history/furnace</a>",1431468049

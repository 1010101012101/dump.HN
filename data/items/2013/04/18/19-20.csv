As with a lot of security, it's a usability trade-off.<p>We work hard to make sure that people only ever access Stripe over HTTPS. Most people use the Stripe API through an existing library. Since the API doesn't work over HTTP, any such library is guaranteed to use HTTPS. Stripe itself is on Chrome's built-in HSTS list, sets HSTS headers, etc.<p>The scenario Stevie describes is unlikely to be an issue unless the user is implementing his or her own library. In that case, though, they're almost certainly going to be using test API credentials. Stripe's API will never return a successful response when you access it over HTTP, so you'll figure out that you can't do this on the very first request.<p>More broadly, what exactly is being defended against isn't particularly clear. There are much easier ways for someone implementing their own library to screw up (skipping cert verification is extremely common and leaves you perpetually vulnerable to HTTPS MITM), and there are many other plausible vectors for an attacker.<p>Even if we <i>did</i> change this, we'd only have solved one small class of accidental key leaks. You could accidentally specify ""stripe.com"" instead of ""api.stripe.com"", for example, and stripe.com will of course always accept HTTP. Or you could typo the domain and send your key to someone else entirely.<p>If we ever did want to solve this, we'd probably do something like:<p>- Monitor HTTP Authorization headers sent to api.stripe.com.<p>- Notify the user if they ever accidentally send a secret key in the clear.<p>- In addition to notifying the user, we could potentially roll the key automatically (though this runs the risk of breaking production code).<p>But I don't think disabling HTTP helps much. (I do think it'd be good if we started monitoring the frequency with which this happens -- if it's common, we should certainly do something like the above; if it ~never happens, it presumably doesn't matter.)<p>Separately, I think that the HMAC-based signature scheme that Stevie proposes is something we might want to do at some stage. A very early version of Stripe actually had something very similar. The issue with all protocols in this vein is that they involve considerably more complexity on the user's end and are harder to debug. But they definitely have some nice security properties.",1366314017

The issue of units is only a problem if you're using a matrix that has units itself. This problem is readily solved by using the correlation matrix instead, which is dimensionless by definition. The downside to this circumvention is that you have essentially re-weighted each of your variables, so the weight contributed by each variable is more similar. This may not be what you want.<p>If PCA is not being used to reduce the dimensionality of multivariate data, this might be invalid. There are other uses of PCA besides working on data (that image reduction technique using SVD comes to mind) that he might be addressing.<p>If you want a treatment of PCA in a respected text (at least by the statistical community--not sure what the ML people think ;) ), look no further than Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman's Elements of Stastical Learning.<p><a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/OLD//ESLII_print4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/OLD//ESLI...</a>",1366313696

If you change one of the variables to a unit that is way out of scale, then it's quite possible that the results of PCA, and many other methods, will change. But that's because it's not scale invariant, and so if you want good results you need to present your variables in the same units, and/or in some normalized format (zscored, etc.) where the scale of one unit doesn't blow the others out of the water.<p>These methods are not magical, and they are not intelligent. They do not know what they're looking at, so it's your job to feed them something reasonable.<p>That said, if you take some physically grounded data and change units, you won't recover different eigenvectors as long as your input data is good.

I wonder what happened to him. Thanks, loopy!<p>Anyway, I created a Yahoo chat client in Win32/C as I was learning the API and the language. I was the only user for quite a while, but eventually I posted it using the free web space EarthLink gave me for being a dial-up subscriber. It got pretty popular through word of mouth.

I've packaged several hundreds of apps for Linux and have been using it almost exclusively since 1997. And the least I can say is that it's a bloody unholy mess. The latest joke/failure in Linux is the packaging of TeX on Fedora which uses (if my memory serves me right) over 3,000 packages!<p>Many developpers just do what they feel like doing and often disregard standards because a lot of them think they know better ( also known as the ""not invented here"" syndrome ). How many times did I send patches upstream to fix an standards issue ( such as a missing pkgconfig file ) and some arrogant developper who thinks he knows better rejects it. And when someone comes in and tries to consolidate the OS a bit (what the systemd guys are trying to do) a horde of reactionary users start trolling the hell out of them.<p>As far as Haiku, I think the plan with the package manager is to only use it to update the base OS.

So when you tap on a tab, your interacting with a native interface laid out in a nib and a message is passed to the javascript app inside the main web view telling it which tab has been selected. The sliding drawers (popularized by Path and Facebook) area also completely native, but they house two other webviews that also are simply running javascript apps in them. Finally, we have a slide out ""quick add"" menu that we determined needed to be native both because the performance when it was implemented in HTML5/CSS3 on older Android devices wasn't acceptable and also because it needed to overlap other native elements.<p>The main reason we need to have some native UI components is because fixed elements are not well supported on older iOS and Android devices. That means that in the webview sandwiched inbetween our top and bottom bars we cannot have <i>any</i> fixed ui elements. This ensures that the scrolling stays smooth on all devices because it's really just utilizing the native webview scroller. Newer versions of iOS and Android <i>do</i> support native-style momentum scrolling within a DIV, but the performance isn't quite there on all but the most powerful devices (for reference, Sencha Touch's <a href=""http://fb.html5isready.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fb.html5isready.com</a> uses these native scrolling divs, and quite impressively too).<p>There are also other features that need to be native under the hood like push notifications support, camera/photo-library support, and contacts support, etc. Thankfully Phonegap makes most of that available to us and for anything that isn't available as a Phonegap plugin we simply wrote ourselves.<p>The way I see it, this ""hybrid"" approach is a necessary stopgap for us HTML5 mobile developers while we wait for more devices to reach the capability of the fastest phones available right now (iPhone 5, Galaxy S3, etc). Eventually we should be able to do almost everything in pure HTML5 like Sencha Touch's demo linked above and ditch the native UI elements completely. There will, however, always need to be some sort of bridge between HTML5 apps on Android and iOS devices and the native APIs that are not made available to those devices' mobile web browsers (contacts, camera, files, push notifications, in-app purchases, etc).<p>I hope that explains it in better detail.

5572368,comment,5569483,5571736,3,0,marknutter,,,"> How is local storage in your experience? Last I talked to people about this, everyone was cursing it for lack of capacity and general quirkiness.<p>We've had no issues with it so far and I heard the same criticisms you did. If you make sure not to store <i>too much</i> stuff in localStorage (there is a limit for UIWebViews) you should be fine.<p>> My concern with HTML is that if FB and LinkedIn were unable to muster the required resources to overcome the engineering challenges of HTML, chances are I won't have those resources either<p>I get that, but it does overestimate the capabilities and resources of FB and LinkedIn. In the end, they are just developers like any other developers solving the same problems everyone else is, and simply throwing more money at the problem doesn't usually fix things. Keep in mind that there's a lot more pressure on FB and LinkedIn to deliver perfection so they are going to be less likely to ""stick it out"".<p>> Native is more predictable.<p>I agree, and there are lots of other benefits to native as well. They must be weighed against the detriments: having to write the same app multiple times for multiple platforms, having to play by Apple's rules, not being able to update apps <i>for</i> customers <i>immediately</i> (that's a huge problem IMO), working with painful layout tools, etc. As always, it's important to weight the pros and cons before choosing a strategy.<p>> Would you say your team is extraordinary in its capacity to wrangle with HTML, or is something like this available to your average YC startup, or to most startups out there?<p>I assure you we are not extraordinary. Anybody with a very basic level of native programming experience and who is competent with HTML5/CSS3 and the latest javascript frameworks (backbone, ember, angular, knockout, etc) can replicate what we did. I think the reason it seems extraordinary is because you only ever see articles about big, trendy companies ditching HTML5. ""Small unknown team builds great HTML5 mobile app"" just doesn't have the same punch. I also believe there is a bit of religious war going on between web developers and native developers so there's always a frenzy whenever there's a drop or two of blood in the water. Ignore all that crap and just choose the solution that suits both your app's requirements and your skills best.",1366311653

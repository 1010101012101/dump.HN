284606,comment,284192,284247,0,0,jsrn,,,"> according to some blog I read, which I couldn't re-find<p>I think this is the blog post by Brendan Eich you are referring to:<p><pre><code>   So my default answer to questions such as the one I got
   at last May's Ajax Experience, ""When will you add
   threads to JavaScript?"" is: ""over your dead body!""

   There are better ways. Clueful hackers keep rediscovering
   Erlang. Then there is STM. One retro stylist I know
   points to an old language-based solution, Hermes.

   A requirement for JS3 (along with hygienic macros) is
   to do something along these more implicit lines of
   concurrency support. In all the fast yet maintainable
   MT systems I've built or worked on, the key idea (which
   Will Clinger stated clearly to me over lunch last fall)
   is to separate the mutable unshared data from the
   immutable shared data. Do that well, with language and
   VM support, and threads become what they should be:
   not an abstraction violator from hell, but a scaling
   device that can be composed with existing abstractions.

   So here's a promise about threads, one that I will
   keep or else buy someone a trip to New Zealand and
   Australia (or should I say, a trip here for those over
   there): JS3 will be ready for the multicore desktop
   workload.

It won't let you subclass 'class'.<p>However it will let you subclass 'Module', which is the superclass of Class, and you can use this to achieve similar ends if not quite as elegantly.<p>The way class methods work wrt to inheritance is a bit different in ruby though, and gives you quite a lot of power to provide special behaviours to subclasses via class methods which can be called in the subclass class definition. The kind of ""we provide a DSL for you to use in your class definitions to configure the subclass"" tricks which (IIRC) tend to require metaclasses in python, don't require them in ruby.<p>There is also an 'inherited' class method callback on Class, which you can use to run code whenever a new class inherits from your class. And this can be used to achieve a lot of things that pythonistas might use metaclasses for.<p>On the whole I think anything possible in one language is possible in the other when it comes to metaprogramming, it's just a matter of how you go about it and how elegant it feels.",1219492985

3842496,comment,3842033,3842033,14,0,joshmlewis,,,"Yeah, that took some dedication, and because we aren't all as dedicated or physicist here are some practical tips I've learned:<p>1. When an officer asks how fast you were going, never say anything over the speed limit or that's automatic guilt.  Just decline to know or tell. A lot of people say within a +5-10mph range over the speed limit because they think that is ""ok"", but in fact anything over the speed limit is speeding and is ticket worthy.<p>2. Look up laws in your area about loopholes. I once had a friend who got pulled over for doing a burn out in his Cobra, the officer was so aggravated he forgot to wear his hat when he got out of his car and the case got dismissed because of it.<p>3. Always be polite. Always, always, always. Even if they're real jerks, which has never happened to me, always be courteous and make things go as smoothly as possible. If you start being an ass they WILL remember it and will take that into consideration when writing the ticket and/or in front of the judge. You'll have a chance to give your side in court, so don't bother wasting your breath with the officer.<p>4. I once got out of a reckless driving ticket ($400+, I was young and dumb) because I just happened to know the director of the area highway patrol. It turned out I was in the top 5 worst tickets the highway patrolman had ever given out in his 20+ years of duty. My director friend told him I was a good kid and my parents were going to kill me anyway, so he let me off.<p>5. And really, the single most best way to not get a ticket, don't break the rules.  Of course in this guys case the officer apparently was mistaken, but more times than not that's not the case.<p>This got large quickly.  Just some things I've learned over a few years of driving.",1334454384

And by background I meant the background of DotA, not IceFrog. I'm quite sure he's not a felon or a KGB spy.<p>About his coding skills, see my reply to MrJagil below. About art and other skills: IceFrog didn't create any of the art in DotA. It all came from community sites (wc3c.net, hiveworkshop.com, the now defunct war3sear.ch, etc.). The game design was overwhelmingly done by previous DotA maintainers and the DotA community via the sites you moderated. Even the tools on which DotA depends for its life (in particular The Widgetizer[1], without which, as a practical matter, DotA can't be loaded because it has too much object data) were all made by other people.<p>This is why Valve naming their game DOTA 2 and attempting to trademark DOTA has angered so many people, and why Blizzard is now going after them. DotA isn't IceFrog's to give, which Valve should know if they did any research into its history. But because they're Valve, people on the outside don't seem to care. If it were Microsoft or EA, I'm sure we'd be having a <i>very</i> different discussion.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?p=704434"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?p=704434</a>",1334452493

Sure, we may not account for very many people. We may not be ""important"" in your world. But I can tell you that when I encounter a website that doesn't work without JS, or balks at my filtering/anonymizing/caching proxy (with custom user-agent), I go elsewhere. I don't forward the URI of that site, or bookmark it. I forget about it. It doesn't exist to me. There are likely a dozen other similar sites willing to get my business or attention. I have no time or patience to waste on people who want me to jump through hoops just to see their sales pitch. To be sure, I turn on Javascript for some sites, but it's a pretty high bar that has to be met. Requiring Javascript to read a blog does not meet that bar.

I had to hack the plugin to handle a case that it wasn't specifically designed to handle in the first one (probably just due to my unfamiliarity with the plugin at that point) and in the second one I had to add all sorts of advanced functionality to an older version of the plugin (v4), which we had used in building the app, initially.<p>My advice is to make sure to start small (single file upload) and build up, instead of just trying to port your solution over, you might also run into issues with Firefox 3 and all of IE if you go too custom, so keep that in mind.<p>It really is a great piece of software, <i>detailed</i> version specific documentation and FAQs, and the author blueimp is most helpful and quick in responding to issues on github. I remember a thread with him that went on for days, delving into specific lines of code and why they were written that way and at every point I kept thinking<p>""Okay, he's either going to cuss me out or stop responding at this point""<p>but he just kept helping out.

One app thinks columns X and Y are dependent in one way, the other app views it another way. Now, one or the both of those apps are screwed for validity.

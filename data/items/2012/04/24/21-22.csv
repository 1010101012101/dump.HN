I know, cuz I have my share of good and not-so-good memories from as young as a little boy to as recent as yesterday about how far a nice sympathetic and understanding word or two can go, and how damaging a cruel and dismissive comment can be.<p>We should all take a lesson from this. We are all human beings, and we all have commonalities we can empathize with and relate to in some capacity. It's all about perspective, and guess what... Perspective is all we have!<p>Use it at your discretion.<p>But remember, when that awkward weird boy changes the world one day, and looks back and says, ""I was once in a gym hanging out with some older blokes, and one fellow gave me the confidence to be myself.I owe it all to him.""",1335304679

3886503,comment,3883682,3884098,21,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""Being weird? Awesome. Being deliberately different? Not so much.""</i><p>I realize I'm straying further afield of the original article in saying this, but we should keep in mind that being ""weird"" (or even being ""different"") isn't always a choice, or at least not a conscious one. I'm not sure if I'd go so far as to suggest that most ""different"" people have no agency in the matter. But a lot of them don't. Being different is a relative status typically assigned <i>to you</i> by the dominant social paradigm and context in which you exist. There certainly can be a choice, i.e., in whether to embrace this difference, or to attempt to amend it. And degree of self-awareness plays a huge role in the outcome. But often, even deliberate attempts to rein in the differences can fail.<p>Long before many (most?) of us even realized we had a conscious say in being weird, our peers made that call for us. What we're actually choosing is how to contextualize and reckon with that weirdness.<p>This is, as you've suggested, far different from a person's deliberately cultivating a surface-level eccentricity in an attempt to stand out (which is really just a case of <i>fitting in</i> by having an interesting quirk).<p>Finally, I'd suggest that those of us who consider ourselves ""weird"" or ""different"" -- regardless of whether that label has been intrinsically or extrinsically imposed -- should take a very nuanced and almost surgical view of it. By self-analyzing the weirdness, you can break it down into its components and decide which elements are useful, which are harmful, which are productive, which are counterproductive. ""Weird"" or ""different"" can be reduced to more elementary traits, rather than seen as broad, blanket terms. The broad terms may be value-neutral, but the smaller components often have values (good or bad).",1335304055

Choosing the name ""thepiratebay"" was an immature move imo, and it doesn't pay proper creedence to the whole idea of stated rules and enforced rules.<p>By that I mean that society expects one thing in name, and will often accept something else in practice. Like we know politicians often have affairs, but in public they profess to have the goal of a traditional marriage. If we saw a politician who had public affairs, we'd all wonder what dirty behavior they were hiding, assuming it's much worse than usual.<p>If the site had a neutral name like ""torrent search"" we'd know they professed to be a neutral data sharing site, but the underbelly was piracy.

There's no comparable way of going the other direction (moving all my files to Dropbox) without losing a ton of functionality. Word is good, but it's really primitive compared to Doc at this point when it comes to collaborative work and access on my phone, tablet, etc.<p>It's also worth noting that in the case of Google Docs, Drive isn't really a syncing solution (unless you're using Docs in offline mode) since there's no files to sync.

3886490,comment,3884238,3885930,1,0,jsnell,,,"Sorry, I was assuming gouranga was asking a genuine question. The question he was asking why these phones cost so much, while the Lumia 710 costs so little. And the reality is that the Lumias are running on hardware that time forgot, and better components cost more money. It's going to be cheaper to build a thick phone with a small battery, a slow processor, little ram and a small low resolution screen than it is to build something more modern. That's just the way things are, not a value judgement or a claim that everyone should have the latest and greatest phone.<p>So why does that 710 use low-end components? One reason is that it's positioned as low or mid-range device, competing against other cheap phones built from cheap components. Another is that there's not much wiggle-room in the WP7 hardware specs. You're going to have a screen of a certain resolution, a certain amount of RAM, a certain kind of Qualcomm SOC, etc.<p>Luckily for Nokia, in this case these reasons are well aligned. Unfortunately for them they're also forced to try to sell pretty much the same hardware in a different case as their flagship devices. (There are minor spec differences like the amount of flash or the exact technology used for the screen).<p>And yes, there are real benefits to the higher specs. For CPU perhaps not so much, but the quality of a screen is a huge selling point. A thinner phone is both a good selling point, and much more convenient to carry around. Extra RAM is always useful - on many mobile devices browsing is really frustrating compared to a desktop partly due to how little data can be cached. A better GPU can be a big deal when it comes to games (certainly Apple has managed to do well there). A phone with better specs is going to have a smoother upgrade path to newer versions of the OS.<p>And I don't see why WP7 phones would be exempt from this. For example, I find it hard to believe anyone could argue that at least some WP7 devices would not be much better with a higher resolution screen than the one mandated by MS. And of course the people buying a Lumia 900 now are going to be really pissed off when they can't upgrade to WP8 next fall due to being sold devices using a 2 year old spec.",1335303855

You will never see the ""Open file"" dialog box again.<p>In this world, the concept of a file on your local computer in some folder does not exist. Your stuff is simply available to you from the cloud from whatever computer. The abstraction or concept of a ""file"" or ""folder"" will fade. Our children will not know what these words mean. They will see their pictures in a web interface with location and time overlayed, completely oblivious to the fact that it happens to be stored as a .jpg file somewhere on google servers and an associated .txt file that contains some meta data about it.<p>We are finally moving beyond (arbitrary) abstractions from mid 1900's.

Giving students tracks in which they could focus their study of computer science.<p>These tracks were generally all theoretical (the exceptions being some classes in platforms and devices), even my friends who had a love for software engineering ended up learning the thoughts  behind each process rather than blindly learning the process itself in order to master said process that is currently practical.<p>The way I treated academic learning is very similar to the process described above by 10098. The learning you experience in college should be some form of aggregate information about past ideas/trials and tribulations. This is the process by which I (as a customer) have found most universities treat their undergraduates. Rather than tailoring them to become masters of a specific problem they try (albeit not successfully, and there are a vast number of people in universities today that don't enjoy, want to have, or have this mindset) to build the next generation of people to find flaws in our current society, in hopes that they have motivation to fix it.<p>That being said you are making the argument that software engineering is a vocational skill. While I'm not denying that the majority of the process that I've found in my limited time in the industry tends to be filled with skills that are akin to any other vocational profession, I don't believe increasing vocational skills help the students. It might in a short term give them a strong basis for obtaining a software related position. It might also give them the ability to perform really well in their jobs at that time being. It does however not enable them to question the process they've learned. It also does not help them find problems within a process.<p>It should also be noted that most companies aren't looking for a master software engineer. They test for intelligence and social skills rather than how strict the student is on testing practices or which design cycle they prefer. These biases also lead towards limiting employment because they'll end up fighting rather than adapting to the new work environment that is already established by the companies views on the subject.<p>A lot of top schools are taking interest in teaching up to date languages, maybe not clojure or even javascript but python is the language that I've seen most Georgia Tech students prefer to program in after taking several courses in it.<p><a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/threads"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/threads</a>\n<a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/roles/masterpractitioner"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/roles/ma...</a>",1335303010

Knowledge of a language is not the final goal of a CS education, because it's the same as teaching a mechanical engineer how a drill works.<p>Also, the tools are based entirely on the theory of computing.

They simply pass beyond our ability to reason about them in the same ways that we reason about numbers in our everyday life.  We can conceive of two and three digit numbers simply by counting to them.  We can conceive of millions and billions by imagining piles of material (a 2 foot cube of sand might be 1-2 billion grains).  We can conceive of larger numbers by counting the number of digits, or equivalently, using logarithms -- often comparing them to the number of particles in the solar system or the known universe, or thinking in terms of how many bits are needed to store the number.<p>At some point, though, we start dealing with numbers so big that Knuth's up-arrows or Conway Chained Arrow Notation become necessary.  We reach a point where the numbers no longer correspond to objects, distances, or physical quantities.  These sorts of large numbers are truly abstract -- the only way we have to measure them is with other ridiculously large numbers, which themselves are only understood as notation.<p>See, for example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers#Examples_of_numbers_in_numerical_order"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_numbers#Examples_of_numbe...</a>",1335301296

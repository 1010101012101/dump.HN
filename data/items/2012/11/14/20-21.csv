Not taking outside investment can definitely slow your growth, but you own it 100% and can dictate the direction that you are going in. You also don't get some of the pressure that funded companies sometimes get.  I know a number of seriously successful companies that were started without funding or investment - many of them are quietly getting on with making money :)",1352926772

It's made me a clearer thinker and better programmer.<p>One might say that SICP is unique in as much as it transcends coding as an act of ""slinging code at a screen"", pushing readers to think carefully about the nature and design of their programs. That's only a sliver of what it does, but it's ever so easy to miss that as a beginning programmer.<p>Yeah, it definitely takes discipline to get through, but it's quite rewarding.",1352926765

And since other renovations - which usually matter much more for people take priority. Add to that the fact that ""we recently did a new kitchen"" sounds much better in conversation that ""we recently bought a toilet seat which costs only a little less than a used car"" - and here you go.<p>The factor of the cost is important too. For $1700 I could redo a whole room - why would I spend this on a toilet when I already have a perfectly working one? Of course, if money is not an issue, it's different - but for most people money still is the issue.",1352926758

If you want to see why Unix programmers scoff at OOP, I recommend ""The Art of Unix Programming"" by Eric Raymond.<p>OOP advocates threw around words like modularity and encapsulation and a lot.  But nobody told programmers that Java and C++ have much worse modularity and encapsulation properties than the traditional Unix style.<p>Ideally under Unix you would have small Java programs and small C++ programs working together and passing messages.  But that's not really how a lot of people architect things these days.  You tend to get monolithic Java codebases and monolithic C++ codebases.  People don't design protocols with care.<p>The web is also very Unix-y.  It's structured around data and simple protocols.  Yet for some reason programmers insist on ""abstracting"" the web with objects.  These attempts have uniformly failed.  There's a reason for that.<p>On a related note, this was discussed on HN recently: <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/163185/torvalds-quote-about-good-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/163185/torval...</a><p>Note that Linus Torvalds is a C programmer -- he doesn't use any ""object oriented"" languages.  Structuring programs around data makes them modular.  A main reason is that you can adapt data from one form to the other, to glue together pieces of code.  You can't adapt byzantine sequences of method calls and inheritance trees -- you end up having to rewrite.  Look at classes in Java programs that have the word ""Adapter"".  Often they are a big smell and barely work, and this is because the fundamental abstractions being used are non-compositional.",1352926518

4785495,comment,4783700,4783700,2,0,rockmeamedee,,,"There is an attitude towards politics that seems to belong especially to liberal arts graduates, and even more, to B authors pushing their next book. You pick up whiffs of it on the discussion threads, in the blog posts and talks. It expresses itself, with the weary arrogance of the guy who fixes your coffee, as a contempt for engineering as hopelessly mechanical. The answers are robotic and don't take humans into account, the implication goes, or at least the route to them doesn't. Public policy ought to be left to the people who know how to get things done: the political science graduates and liberal arts thinkers.<p>You can understand these feelings, to a certain extent. 'Idea people' deal with people and their imprecise measurements. Authors must look intelligent when pushing bullshit theories. The bailout is either great or not; the country either stands up or it doesn't. Neither matters unless the argument is well written. The endless technical muddle of public life is going to seem despicable to people who are used to pursuing their ends talking about their feelings.<p>But society isn't a drum circle. Its parts are people, who need struts and circuits. That is why a STEM education is far more useful to the policymaker (and by extension, the citizen) than a liberal arts one. Here are some of the things that the STEM fields, and the habits of alertness that they foster, will teach you: that when people have different but equally valid perspectives you shouldn't give them shit for doing engineering; that Truth just means matching our models of reality, sometimes several values can fit the model, that does not both make them right; that judgments of value are influenced by several judgments of fact in our brains, factors like priming, cognitive biases and learned behaviors affect every decision you make; that society will never be a smoothly functioning machine, but proper use of our tools and technology can help.<p>Blog posts arguing cute but nevertheless wrong all-compassing theories of the world, which appeal to the kind of person Im talking about, and which are usually far more fiction than sciencethat is, the human complexity of sciencetends to give them bad numbers upholding theories that are way too orderly to be plausible as manifestations of human nature. Perhaps that is why our political discussions often involve the same, tired wrong arguments. We either go Keynes, Hayek, or are replaced by socialists. Not for nothing does the idea of the silver bullet remain the central figure of the liberal arts imagination.<p>I've never written a post critiquing the idea that we are heading towards a multiplanetary civilization. I have no idea if it's possible or not, and I know enough not to make predictions that far out into the future. It is characteristic of the liberal arts mentalitywhose representatives are so often biased enough to throw around statements like 'adolescent of spirit if not of age', to suppose that our fundamental problems are unresolvable. The thinker believes himself possessed of superior wisdom. In fact, he has no expertise. Wisdom is not to be found in an essay; its formula is experience plus reflection. Engineering is the management of human affairs, the never-ending calibration of interests, vanities, and corruptions. It depends on knowing, how things work, and how people do to build a better world.",1352926437

First, it naturally teaches you one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science (abstraction) by example; with the SICP approach, you learn about abstractions by constructing your own idioms for abstractions within a programming paradigm!<p>Second, applications become easier and easier to develop the more one learns to break out of a single paradigm and borrow ideas and tools from each as needed - otherwise, it's easy to get stuck in a rut and miss a simple but elegant solution to the problem at hand. Being able to cross-pollinate features or ideas idiomatic in one language to another gives you a Leatherman instead of an x-acto knife.<p>Having a fundamental grasp of programming paradigms makes programming languages feel like a second skin, rather than an obstacle sitting between the brain and the binary output.",1352926434

As a young engineer I started a primarily-software business in the early 90's and was too independent and unsophisticated to even consider outside investment.  Honestly I wouldn't have known where to start - there was no public internet yet.  I did however bring in a trustworthy partner with a completely different set of innate skills to complement mine.  Both of us worked hard, used credit cards when we needed to but had to make money all along the way, followed the demand to design our products, grew the business and finally sold it when the dot-com era was peaking.  Even though we weren't really a dot-com, money was flowing freely then in many areas around it.  I was old enough to remember the housing boom/bust of the S&L era and I was betting the dot-com era was unsustainable too.  There is always luck involved to some extent and it was a white-knuckled ride but in hindsight the worst case outcome was corporate or personal bankruptcy and we were young and would have had plenty of time to recover.

I've noticed the type of person who hate IDEs tend to fall much more into the religious and close-minded crowd than those who don't. Most people I know who use IDEs are perfectly competent at an editor like emacs/vim and simply prefer different tools, but that doesn't stop many people who prefer text editors from trying to feel superior by stereotyping IDE users as paint-by-number morons incapable of embracing the beauty of the command line. It's a traditionalist and condescending attitude that I think is holding us in the status quo more than something like OO's popularity, because there are all sorts of cool programming language ideas you can come up with if you're willing to sacrifice the source code being easily edited by a text editor. Yet we see far less experimentation there then we do with functional programming languages, and I think that's because functional languages are perceived as cool and smart but IDEs are associated with the philistine class of programmers.",1352926122

It also <i>increases</i> water usage, albeit modestly, which is sort of anti-california but that was before I talked with the toilet guys who said the water saving toilets only save water on urine flushes since it it typical for solid matter to require more than one flush cycle.

This group is unique in that it is made up of around thirty stars that all have the same age, have the same composition and that move together through space. Its the link between the planet and AB Doradus that enabled us to deduce its age and classify it as a planet, researcher Lison Malo explained. </i><p>I find it fascinating that we have identified a group of stars that are (i'm assuming) moving in synchronous towards a general direction.

Please explain to me how the fact that no chemical reaction occurs when beating an egg is in any way relevant, or even related to the discussion, or anything I said.  I didn't say beating an egg caused a chemical reaction, and at no point would anyone who has even the loosest grip on reality consider that to be relevant at all.<p>Had you just suggested that beating eggs is a side effect, and thus not purely functional you would have gotten a response.  But when you go so far off the rails that the only reasonable explanations are that you are trolling or insane you shouldn't expect people to take you seriously enough to bother responding.<p>Yes, beating an egg changes the state of the egg from unbeaten to beaten.  Yes, this is a difference, however it is not a difficult to understand difference.  I explain it all the time, that's why I used it as an example.  ""With functional programming, instead of the egg_beater function changing the egg, it takes in the unbeaten egg, and returns to you a beaten egg.  If you gave the unbeaten egg a name, you can still use it."".  That is easy to understand, which is why people respond with ""oh, ok"" instead of confusion.  This concept has to be understood when teaching OOP too, as generally methods that just change state return ""this"" so you can chain method calls: egg->beat()->fry().

4785262,comment,4784472,4784472,1,0,rskar,,,"The BLS (see <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm</a> ) says the median hourly wage in May 2011 is $16.57 across all occupations (mean hourly is $21.74). That fact should help put things in better perspective.<p>Assuming $20/hr as a good ballpark figure for most working people, that would mean working 12500 hours to gross $250000 in a year. Clearly one person couldn't possibly do all that; so in a double-income household that's really only 6250 hours each. That's a 17 hour workday, taking no days off. Unless they really insist on having a day off every so often, in which case that'll be 20 hours a workday.<p>In all seriousness, if it's a power-couple pulling in $250k gross annually, that's somewhere in the neighborhood of $60/hr for each of their jobs, which is about three times the median overall, and more than what the ""median"" scientist or engineer makes (per BLS stats). According to BLS, median wages are over $50/hr for these occupations: doctors, psychiatrists, Chief Executives, dentists, Petroleum Engineers, senior managers, judges, magistrates, Air Traffic Controllers, pharmacists, lawyers, and physicists. The median for ""Computer and Mathematical Occupations"" overall is about $36/hr.<p>So who are among the roughly $20/hr crowd? They would include (within median wages $18 thru $22): Heavy and Tractor-Trailer Truck Drivers, Museum Technicians and Conservators, Credit Counselors, Statistical Assistants, Mental Health Counselors, Machinists, Carpenters, Surgical Technologists, Licensed Practical and Licensed Vocational Nurses, Sheet Metal Workers, Interpreters and Translators, Medical Equipment Repairers, Firefighters, and Structural Iron/Steel Workers, etc. These occupations sound like middle-class lifestyles to me.<p>Assuming a two-income household, each working 1800 hours at $20/hr, the annual household income is $72000 gross (hopefully with benefits). And there you go, a fairly objective definition of a middle-class family, of about $70k a year.<p>To anyone blessed with over $200k/yr, just consider you're really at a place where you could buy - lock, stock, and barrel! - the sort of residence the $70k/yr live in every few years. Really! Just cut back on your extravagances, and you could own a fine middle-class home outright in five years or less. The $70k/yr folks may take decades to achieve the same.<p>This is not to say you shouldn't enjoy, or that you haven't earned, your success - nothing of the sort. It's just that nobody really believes that someone who has the means to own a nice home in rather short time is middle-class too.",1352923847

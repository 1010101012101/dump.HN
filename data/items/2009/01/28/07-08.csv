For example, the fertile arable land available is running out. That is as hard a fact as there is.<p>Cities grow usually on fertile land, and large suburbs make this problem several times bigger.<p>In the last couple of years there were thousands of protests around the globe because of food prices. You might not notice it as it's probably only a fraction of your costs, but for many (most?) people in the world it is their main expense. And most of the food gets sent to the best payer automagically.

453489,comment,452264,452264,0,0,RobGR,,,"The most reliable general solution on linux is 3Ware RAID cards, but linux software RAID generally works, as other posters have noted.<p>If you are having persistent problems, you should search carefully for a flaky hardware cause.  Are the drives in an external sata enclosure that might have a barrel-type power connector that is sometimes jiggled ?  Are all the problems always on the same motherboard -- perhaps it has a bad IDE controller ?  Are the drives overheating ?<p>If your drives support it, try to use the smartmon tools to see if one or both is having errors.  Also, consider writing a script to dump and archive the output of smartctl -a .  Next time you have an issue, look at those outputs over time, and in addition to the badblocks and so on, look at the recorded number of times the disk has been powered up, and see if this is consistent with the number of times the computer has been rebooted.<p>I have done a lot of RAID stuff, and currently I am moving away from it and making servers that have just one disk in them.  The reason is, is that I have decided that the best way to acheive reliability is to have two copies of any important computer.  RAID sometimes seems to introduce more problems that it solves, and switching to a second machine that is maintained by rsync is quick and always works.",1233129029

If anything, the lesson is, ""don't use Google as a registrar"", though I suppose you could argue that the bad support is an overall issue.<p>In general, I would avoid any of these reseller situations, since the error could occur in multiple places and both parties would probably assume that it's the other's fault.",1233128858

If you replace ""tags ought to do"" with ""archival systems ought to do"" it's an interesting meditation.<p>Although, her notion of encoding potential narratives into images seems like the old AI dream. Like you could somehow query ""triumph against adversity"" and get a picture of a schooner crashing through a wave. I think after the last 50 years we have to be more humble about what machines can achieve.<p>P.S: this is the fault of the hosting magazine, Tekka, but they are certainly failing even at elementary archiving and contextualization duties here. The date of publication is not noted, nor is there any link to describe who Cathy Marshall is. There's an issue/volume header at the top, without any other context. They're thinking print, not web.

453472,comment,452946,453222,0,0,dasil003,,,"Cuban's point is largely specious--the cost of distribution is high.  The Internet doesn't magically make things cheap.  Granted.<p>However what the Internet does do is level the playing field (at least compared to traditional media distribution methods).  This means that cranky old white men clutching yesteryear's business models will have their lunch eaten sooner or later.<p>Even though scalability is an issue, it hasn't been solved because the demand hasn't been high enough yet.  How many events have to scale that big?  In this case, the long tail of content (meaning anything that needs to scale to more than a million simultaneous views) is the vast majority of content.  Hulu doesn't have any trouble streaming the most popular television shows.  How many Superbowls and Obama inaugurations actually happen?<p>Furthermore, the solution for massive scalability already exists.  It's called BitTorrent, and Cuban was remiss in not mentioning it.  BitTorrent makes scalability a function of total Internet bandwidth.  It also transfers the hardware costs to the users (who don't see it as a cost).  The bandwidth is still more expensive than television broadcast, but I imagine reaching everyone in the US via television is not exactly cheap either.",1233127744

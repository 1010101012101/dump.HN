10048929,comment,10048706,10048706,0,0,jonathaneunice,,,"A couple of techniques I&#x27;ve found useful:<p>1. &quot;New and Notable&quot; philosophy. Clear focus on documenting what is new and notable about each update. Putting it in a larger context than just &quot;this branch/this sprint&quot; and making it meaningful to those who may not be deeply embedded in the project. (Learned/adopted from the Eclipse project).<p>2. Tagged comments. Be disciplined about tagging comments for specific purposes, such as `# TODO:` or `# FIXME:`, so that those working inside code can quickly jot down their thoughts and observations as they have them, while working, yet they can also be consolidated by IDE views or external grep scripts into broader reports about outstanding issues and options.<p>3. Labeled commit messages. I often include &quot;ATP&quot; in commit messages, meaning &quot;all tests pass.&quot; While you might rightfully assume that actual releases or even pushes to upstream repositories pass all tests as a condition of release/push, my projects follow a &quot;commit early, commit often&quot; protocol that sees many intermediate stages committed to local repos. Unless you&#x27;re committed to regularly and extensively pruning/grooming repo history, even minor commits are going to be pushed upstream eventually. So I try to embed in the messages shorthand notes about testing status. (A variation on this theme is to include urls to CI test runs.)<p>4. Diffable formats. Encode as many design notes, change logs, and other project narrative information into Markdown, YAML, RST, or other formats that can be easily diffed and tracked by version control systems over time. Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, and Google Docs also have built-in change tracking and collaboration features, making them another evolvable option, albeit with slightly less transparency than pure text formats.<p>5. Constant vigilance. A disciplined, repeated return to, and updating of, change logs, release notes, design notes, to-do lists, tagged comments, architecture descriptions, and the other documents that form the project narrative.",1439398548

There is a lightweight CF script for development purposes in the Grid repo, but our main CF script is currently in a private repository.<p>> picture approval workflow<p>We had discussions with our picture desk about the level of permissions desired. Currently, we prefer the approach of keeping publishing open, so as not to introduce tedious barriers and slow down publishing (e.g. in case of breaking news, etc). There is a balance between the cost of publishing the wrong thing (e.g. not rights cleared) vs the missed value of publishing too late.<p>To balance the openness, we are focusing on providing high degrees of visibility to our picture editors, e.g. a feed of all images about to be published that aren&#x27;t fully rights cleared. We also work really hard to get the information properly recorded (ideally automated) so the rights information is accurate about whether a picture can be used or not.<p>At the end of the day, we want to empower desks with the tools to come up with their own workflows and ways to limit risks associated with allowing all (or most) people to publish content, rather than imposing a rigid workflow.<p>- Séb, lead developer on Grid",1439398406

In most of these cases there isn&#x27;t necessarily a right way, one implementation may handle clean data better while another handles dirty/noisy data better.<p>Some examples of spots where interpretations differ are:<p>1) Do you exhaustively or randomly search for categorical splits, require one hot encoding or use some other heuristic?<p>2) Do you use 32 or 64 bit floats? Or do you support both but stop tree growth but have a minimum impurity decrease constant to make sure tests pass on both (scikit does this, it is essentially an unexposed hyper parameter).<p>3) How do you handle features that have become constant in the branch of a tree being extended? Scikit insists that at least one non constant feature be examined for each potential split resulting in bigger trees, other implementations will examine only m features even if they are all constant. I made this switchable in mine, scikit behavior works better on many test data sets, the other way on some noisy overfitting prone datasets.<p>4) If default paramaters are used do you default to gini impurity or entropy? Do you round to the nearest number or just up (so you always get at least one) after taking the square root of the number of features to set the number of features examined for each split.<p>All of this just means it is important to try different implementations and do hyperparameter searches etc on the data you actually care about.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ryanbressler/CloudForest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ryanbressler/CloudForest</a>",1439398343

(this time with some mild enthusiasm from part of the community). In the past Mike Hearn has pitched censorship features in Tor[3], attempting to subvert the inclusion of privacy fixes in Tor[4], proposed &quot;redlists&quot; of supposedly undesirable transactions in Bitcoin[5]. The current branch of Bitcoin XT already includes an alarmingly ill advised hardcoded blacklist of supposedly Tor exit nodes which are de-prioritized[6].<p>The measure of &quot;consensus&quot; has already slipped down to 75% when it become clear that 95% of the hashrate was never going to happen. The solution from Mike Hearn is that if miners don&#x27;t want to get to 75%, he will simply hardcode his own centralized markers into Bitcoin wallets[7] to make sure it happens regardless. This is unbelievably toxic stuff, and spells certain death of Bitcoin if it goes ahead.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=3kt5Reeh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=3kt5Reeh</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29qafs/circle_ceo_issues_thinly_veiled_threat_of_hard/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29qafs/circle_ceo_...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-core-development-falling-behind-warns-mike-hearn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-core-development-falling-beh...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007167.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007173.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/505-coin-tracking/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/505-coi...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/blob/73c9efe74c5cc8faea9c2b2c785a2f5b68aa4c23/src/torips.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/blob/73c9efe74c5cc8fa...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34162353/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/34162353/</a>",1439397193

Simplicity is an absolute metric and describes the number of dependencies a thing has, while ease is a relative metric describing your understanding of said thing.<p>For example, a singleton is easy to learn and easy to use, but since every function using it adds a hidden dependency it quickly grows in complexity to the point its impossible to reason about it without forgetting something.<p>On the other hand, a Promise is simple as it depends on nothing but a producer and a consumer, no matter how much you compose them. Yet I&#x27;ve seen many experienced developers struggle to learn how to use them as they&#x27;re not easy to understand at first.<p>This is somewhat related to meta ignorance. From my own experience I&#x27;ve seen a tendency in novice programmers to stick with things which are both easy to learn and use. Their projects go well initially but they grow less and less productive over time as complexity creeps in from the composition of all these easy to use things.<p>I&#x27;ve always said experience in our industry is knowing what not to use in order to stay productive in the long run.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to Rich Hickey explaining it in depth: <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1439397147

It was a bit of a problem really, so people were not allowed to get mixed into teams. After that game Treyarch moved to do mainly Spiderman, and then Call of Duty. The latest COD also has quite a spectacular UI system, but much less coders are involved into bringing it up. But today&#x27;s standards are even much higher - cool animations, links, socially enabled (twitch, facebook, etc.).<p>Some studio have made success with flash-compatible renderers, and we even thought for NHL2K2 to use one, but first it was only compatible with the Windows version of the Dreamcast (okay, I barely remember now, as we didn&#x27;t used it, but there was a choice whether you can ship your game with some barebones NT system on the Dreamcast - but you had to lose 2mb to the oS). So that middleware (I think) required it, and it wanted somewhere from 2-4mb more on top.<p>One big problem, back in the days, with the UI is that you can have tons of memory in your main menu, but you barely have anything while the game is playing. So your &quot;PAUSE&quot; menu might use completely different code path, and look quite differently. The alternative is to reload things after PAUSE, but this decreases the quality of the product, also much harder to test, and you would hear the DISC &quot;screaming&quot; soo much :)<p>Nonetheless Dreamcast was fun to work on, spare the compiler, and the debugger :)",1439396917

The argument the small-blockers are making isn&#x27;t that we want to keep block size small to attempt to increase fees. Instead they&#x27;re saying we want to keep block size small to avoid centralization pressures, and if this means higher fees then so be it.<p>> Ultimately miners decide which transactions to include in a block or reject so if miners feel they need to get a certain fee per transaction that is their prerogative regardless of the block size.<p>Again the issue is a bit more complex. A miner can of course enforce any fee policy they want, but that policy will only have a significant effect if it is enforced by a large pool. And suppose a large pool decided that they will accept all transactions, regardless of fees, up to the max block size, then all <i>other</i> miners have to deal with the consequences of this decision, because they have to validate the blocks produced by the large pool.

Regions are more appropriate for fighting the speed of light (i.e. locating your site closer to your users). As an illustration of this, Amazon told us that the US version of amazon.com runs in a single region.<p>Incidentally, the other interesting take away from that meeting was to avoid using autoscaling to respond to failures. This is because provisioning instances can fail when there&#x27;s heavy demand and that&#x27;s frequently the case when Amazon is experiencing outages in other regions and availability zones. Instead, we&#x27;ve been urged to provision 150% of what we need (50% in each AZ) so that if any one AZ goes down, we can still handle all our traffic. Where autoscaling works well is in responding to spikes in our own need rather than situations where many Amazon customers will have need.<p>Sorry for the digression, but I found that consultation interesting and it&#x27;s clear that others have the same misconceptions that I had before learning the thought process behind the building blocks that AWS gives us.",1439396461

I&#x27;m sure someone could invest the time to dig-up the data and corroborate or refute my statement.<p>I think game development must rank way up there with restaurants in terms of business failure rates.  It might even be worst than restaurants but the data could be impossible to collect.<p>Why?<p>Because restaurant failures are a matter of public record while game developers more often fail privately.  The data simply evaporates.  It&#x27;s a really tough business, even with money.<p>For the most part lack of business experience and idealism or hubris can play a big role in this.  The good old &quot;the market is <insert big number> billions, if we only grab 0.1%&quot; fallacy.<p>To be sure, hubris and doing something because you love it has it&#x27;s place and fortunes have been made because of this.  That said, the cold hard reality is that the gaming industry is paved with the corpses of probably millions of entrepreneurial efforts who have tried and failed.<p>Generally speaking, for most developers, I think there&#x27;s far more money in developing games for those who have cash to burn (whether successfully or not) than to try to create the next blockbuster.<p>As a small data point, years ago we were approached by a company to develop an iOS children&#x27;s game for them.  Lots of animation, sound, graphics creation, etc.  They had no experience in software development at all.  They wanted to convert this low budget cartoon character into a game because they convinced themselves they&#x27;d make millions with an app.<p>We told them it would cost $50K to $250K (or more) and months of development depending on specs.  Of course, they had no specifications.  It would be impossible to understand costs without a solid spec.<p>We also recommended they DO NOT develop this game and stick to their core business.  In fact we pushed back hard on this point.  I sat down with the CEO for a couple of hours to explain failure rates, challenges, issues, etc.  They needed to fundamentally transform their company and were not equipped to do so at the time.<p>I got an angry email from the CEO telling me we were crooks and how they found a company in India that could build them the entire game for just $15K in three months.  What the hell did I know?  Right?<p>A year later, almost to the day, I got an email from the same CEO asking if we could meet.  We did.  He revealed they burned the $15K and got nothing more than a slideshow made with templates.  They then found a larger company (also in India) and burned an additional $50K and got something that was buggy and wasn&#x27;t even playable.  By the time he asked me for a meeting they had burned through over $150K trying to have their game made and had nothing.  They couldn&#x27;t even submit it to the app store.  They were nearly out of money.<p>You could probably guess what happened next.  He asked if we could fix it for $20K.  I explained I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone would have any interest in touching that code-base for any amount of money.  And, no, $20K couldn&#x27;t even touch building the app they envisioned a year earlier.  I repeated my recommendation to stick to their core business.  Which they did.  After learning an expensive lesson.<p>Anyhow, long story to relate one type of scenario behind game development where ignorance and hubris meet a pile-o-cash and a bonfire follows.<p>Sorry to see the Woolfe team fail.  I don&#x27;t think I am being a pessimist when I say this is far more likely to be the outcome with games.  Kudos for trying.  Move on.  Quickly.",1439396378

In Baltimore, where I live, you can either send your kids to private school, or send your kids to a school where some significant fraction of everyone is in a gang. Or you can move into one of the exorbitantly priced suburbs, increasing your carbon footprint and contributing to the exodus of middle class people that makes schools in the city such a disaster to begin with.",1439396086

In GPG&#x27;s model a MITM or malicious mirror can serve you old, known vulnerable content that you&#x27;ll accept as valid because the signatures verify. This is not possible with TUF as metadata is additionally signed with a timestamping key.<p>Second, TUF has a property called &#x27;survivable key compromise&#x27; which basically means that there are a hierarchy of keys involved in the system, each with a different responsibility and security requirements. There&#x27;s a root key that&#x27;s kept offline, a target key responsible for signing actual content, a timestamping key for freshness, and a snapshot key to tie all the other keys together. GPG&#x27;s model does allow for signing subkeys, but it is rather clunky to use and many of the Linux package managers don&#x27;t support using signing subkeys, sadly.<p>Finally, GPG&#x27;s usability leaves something to be desired. Docker makes pushing and pulling of images extremely easy, essentially making everyone a publisher of content.

Execute, FAIL, make more adjustments, etc. This rapid failure/remediation cycle is somewhat unique, as it opens us to try new and innovative things without fear of failure: failing is just part of the learning process. Since failure is &quot;cheap&quot;, we tend to gravitate to sucking up all information about failures, in the hopes of learning from it.<p>Now think about most other trades: cooking/carpentry/plumbing/etc. When you fail, there are material losses. So that learning curve is expensive, and you often apprentice and learn from someone doing it correct, rather than trial and error (though you get a bit of both for sure).<p>I suspect this is the same reason when really interesting Post-Mortems are posted, they shoot up, and lots of positive commentary around them.

    Without Apple’s prior written approval or as permitted  
    under Section 3.3.25 (In App Purchase API), an
    Application may not provide, unlock or enable 
    additional features  or functionality through
    distribution mechanisms other than the App Store
    or VPP/B2B  Program Site
</code></pre>
Finally, you do realize that the App store policies are subject to change in order to adapt to hacks like this, right?<p>Again cool hack but it will be interesting to see if it gets out of the starting gate.",1439395292

That might be easier for you instead of &#x27;Computer Analyst&#x27;. You need a degree and a job offer (where the title is Software Engineer). I think most large software companies in the US will happily hire TN visa people. Also large companies usually have immigration lawyers on tab which makes the visa process much more reliable.",1439395246

Thankfully, the year 2015 gave us a game that feels like the proverbial &quot;spherical AAA game in a vacuum&quot;: The Order 1886. Seriously, it might not be the best game ever, but it feels like it was made to become the definition of &quot;AAA look&quot; for the next year at least. And yes, making a game of such visual quality with only 10 people is flat out impossible with current technology, and it&#x27;s hard for me to even imagine the technology that would make it possible.",1439395223

For example one student would be on algebra 1 and another on calculus.  I think it is easier emotionally to think of someone else as just farther along than better than you.  Traditional in room lecture based learning required all students to be at the same point.  This is a terrible assumption because many times it&#x27;s not true.  Assume a student was not able to focus during Algebra 1 because of a tragic event during that year, like the loss of a parent.   Without herculean effort that student will be lost in geometry, trig, and calculus because they lack the Algebra 1 foundation.  One year of missed learning turns into four.<p>I hope that MOOCs allow for this to be fixed.  No longer would the assumption need to be made that all students need learn at the same pace.  This means the 40% of gifted kids won&#x27;t be bored, and 20% of kids who learn a little slower won&#x27;t be hopelessly lost.<p>The other benefit to the learning being self paced and through computers is that you could test progress through small quizzes.  If a student failed a quiz, she could simply relearn the material.  This eliminates, the TEST, a huge unnecessary stresser in children&#x27;s lives. You could also test material from several quizzes ago to make sure the important points are hammered home through spaced repetition.<p>Most teachers I know currently spend 80% of the year teaching to the test.  Self paced materials means that you&#x27;ll be able to measure performance of a kid and a teacher by how they do over a year, and not how they do on one day.<p>Anyway that&#x27;s my dream of MOOCs and automated learning in the class room :).",1439395211

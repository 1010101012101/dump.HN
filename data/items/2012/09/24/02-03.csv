That is not exactly a new problem.  It has been simmering for quite some time.  And who in a modern economy could argue that scientific progress should not always be paramount?  These are like noble truths.<p>But then he is inserting some positive references about Google, the web and Silicon Valley.  Strangely, (positive) references to what I would consider ""real science"" are missing.<p>This is only how I see it.  You may disagree.  Who knows, maybe ""Web 2.0"" will propel the economy upwards, back to year 2000 levels.  And capital investment will flow into ""real science"" again.  The number of biotech startups will rise.   Jobs in science will become plentiful.  New drug candidates will fill development pipelines.  And it will have all started with some ""Web 2.0 fluff"".

There is even a standard for distributing time sync over a ethernet network (IEEE 1588). This has become a big deal as cell site backhaul transitions from SONET to ethernet.

4562964,comment,4562211,4562211,40,0,tikhonj,,,"As usual in these threads about Go, I really wish people would consider Haskell as a nice alternative. A lot of people write Haskell off as ""academic"" or ""impractical"", which I feel is not an entirely fair assessment.<p>Particularly: Haskell is fast, concurrent by design (whatever that means, I'm sure Haskell is :P), typed but not cumbersome or ugly (less cumbersome and ugly than Go's types, even) and--most importantly for this article--does error handling really well.<p>In a certain sense, Haskell's main method for handling errors is actually similar to Go's. It returns a type corresponding to <i>either</i> an error or a value (this type, naturally, is called Either). This method is special, oddly enough, because it <i>isn't</i> special: Either is just a normal Haskell type so the error checking isn't baked into the language.<p>Coming from another language, you would expect to have to check your return value each time. That is, you fear your code would look like this pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    if isError val1 \n      then pass val1\n      else val2 <- someFunction val1\n           if isError val2\n           ...\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this is not the case! The people implementing Either noticed that this was a very common case: <i>most</i> of the time, you want to propagate an error value outwards and only do any work on a valid value. So you can actually just write code like this:<p><pre><code>    do val1 <- someValue\n       val2 <- someFunction val1\n       val3 <- someFunction val2\n       someFunction val3\n</code></pre>\nthen, if <i>any</i> of the values return an error, it gets propagated to the end of the code. Then, when you want to check if you actually got a valid value--maybe in some central location in your code, or wherever is convenient--you can just use a normal case analysis.<p>Additionally, while the errors <i>do</i> pass through essentially silently, the type checker does ensure you deal with them at some point before using or returning them. If you ever want to get the Int from a Either Error Int, you have to either handle the error case somehow or explicitly ignore it (e.g. with a partial pattern match). The latter option will generate a compiler warning, so you can't do it by accident without being notified.<p>So the mechanism is simple, but it can also stay out of your way syntactically. So what else is this good for? Well, it's just a normal data type, nothing special; you can use existing library functions with these values. For example, you can use the alternation operator <|> to find the first non-error value:<p><pre><code>    val1 <|> val2 <|> someFunction 5 <|> ...\n</code></pre>\nThis is often a very useful idiom which would be harder to write with a different way of handling errors. There are more utility functions like this (e.g. optional) that let you make your intents very clear at a high level. The optional function, for example, lets you do exactly what it claims: you can mark a value as ""optional"", meaning that any error from it will be ignored rather than propagated.<p>You can also layer on this error-handling logic on other similar effects. For example, there are some types (like LogicT) that represent backtracking search. Combining error-handling with nondeterminism gives you a question: should an error cause the <i>whole</i> computation to fail, or only that particular branch? The beauty is that you can choose <i>either</i> option: if you wrap LogicT with ErrorT (this is just like Either except it can be combined with other types) an error will cause the <i>whole</i> computation to fail; if you wrap ErrorT with LogicT, the error will only cause the current branch to fail. This not only makes it easy to choose one or the other, but also makes it very clear which one you <i>did</i> choose: it's right there in the type system in  a very declarative fashion.<p>Haskell also has a bunch of other advantages which aren't worth going into here. I think anybody looking for something like Go--a fast, high-level, concise, typed alternative to Python--should <i>definitely</i> consider Haskell. While it may not seem so at first, I believe that Go and Haskell are good for a very similar set of problems and so actually overlap quite a bit.<p>If you really dislike some particular things about Haskell, you should also consider some similar languages like OCaml and F#. I personally prefer Haskell, but there are definitely good cases to be made for either of the other two.",1348454650

Whether that is R&D or creativity as part of a manufacturing process.<p>It is obvious they feel underpaid. It is their interest to get the most pay for their labour as they can get. Doesn't mean that the economy can afford to pay them more. Nor does it mean they would be paid more with a different unskilled job. China's struggle is that it has a massive surplus of unskilled labourers. The only way they can keep these people employed is by producing unskilled jobs for a low cost.<p>What is an example of an unskilled job? Sticking stickers on products. How much does it cost to get a machine to do it? $X. Then if a human wants to do it they must be to do at a comparable cost, otherwise market forces will eliminate his job. China is leaving low value manufacturing in coastal regions (where most of the manufacturing is done due to lower logistic costs). The unskilled migrant workers who haven't made their saving yet, and don't soon, are going to be far worse off in the future as they will have less earning opportunity and will be competing additional against logistic costs.<p>Many people fail to understand that things won't start costing more if unskilled Chinese labour would cost more. What would happen is we would start using simple machines to do the work and there would be less unskilled Chinese jobs available (leading to a slowdown of the Chinese economy).

Also, Obama politically polarized his research spending, so he sucks.<p>Climate Change<p>Obama: I agree that climate change is an issue, and I have proposed (and will continue to propose) carbon pollution limits, reduced emissions, and reduced dependency on oil.<p>Romney: Waffle, waffle: warming is occurring, and it's partly man-made, but there's no ""scientific consensus"". Science doesn't dictate policy. Obama sucks, it's called ""global warming"", not ""america warming"", so it's China's fault. Cap and trade sucks, carbon tax sucks, let's do a ""no regrets policy"" that will reduce emissions but not harm the economy. That means ""clean coal"" and ""safe nuclear"", not hydro or solar power.<p>Research and the Future<p>Obama: I spent 90 billion on research into clean energy. I will also continue investing in medical and security research. Also, permanent R&D tax credit.<p>Romney: Obama spent 90 billion dollars on a failed attempt to promote green energy. I would have spread that out over 20 years. I will give money to corporations for research rather than give the money to scientists. Also, Obama sucks.<p>Pandemics and Biosecurity<p>Obama: We need to work internationally to help address communicable diseases.<p>Romney: We need to invest in public health monitoring systems. Also, Obama stifles medical innovation. Did I mention he sucks?<p>Education<p>Obama: We need to focus on STEM, goal is 100k STEM teachers, announcing federal program: STEM Master Teacher Corps.<p>Romney: Education sucks, A Nation at Risk, only American politics is suckier than education. Spending on education sucks. Teacher unions suck. Strangely, Obama doesn't appear to suck. I will privatize education with charter schools, transfer public school funding to said private schools (I call this ""enabling choice""), penalize teachers whose students don't test well, and try to hire ""better"" teachers.<p>Energy<p>Obama: ""All of the above"", increase fuel efficiency standards, reduce dependence on foreign oil. Renewable energy.<p>Romney: Increase ""domestic energy production"" (he probably means oil), Obama and green energy sucks, where's my Keystone XL Pipeline? Drill, baby, drill.<p>Food<p>Obama: Give the FDA the resources, authority, and tools to do their job. Strengthen standards, support certified organic initiatives.<p>Romney: Preventative practices are best set by the people who produce the food, not government. Only they know whether or not a particular requirement will be profitable -- I mean feasible. I will have the FDA partner with growers and producers to determine the correct standards to use. Obama.... doesn't suck this time?<p>Fresh Water<p>Obama: I support water conservation and waste water programs through grants, and will work collaboratively with communities to ensure they have access to fresh water.<p>Romney: Lawsuits against businesses for clean water suck.

I will continue this in my next administration. I do not support distorting science to fit a political agenda, and make decisions based on facts, not ideology.<p>Romney: I will base my policies on the best available scientific and technical information, and will avoid manipulating science for political gain. Obama sucks and distorts science to fit his agenda. He will get rid of mercury pollution by bankrupting the coal industry. Also mercury pollution is measured in dollars. Finally, I will establish a ""regulatory cap"", forcing agencies to spend as much time repealing and streamlining outdated regulations as they do imposing new ones.<p>Space<p>Obama: We will continue to focus on sending humans to an asteroid by 2025 and Mars by 2030. Space is exciting and inspirational work. \nRomney: Space is crucial to spurring the economy, innovation, and national security. Also, it shows how awesome we are to other countries. I will not give NASA more money, I will clarify their priorities: practical missions, security/defense/military use, and stuff that can be used by corporations for profit.<p>Critical National Resources<p>Obama: China sucks for not exporting more rare earth minerals, and we're suing them for it. We need to be less reliant on other countries (like sucky China), so I'm going to focus on research for electronics that don't rely on rare earths.<p>Romney: The US used to produce rare earths self-sufficiently.

4562943,comment,4561274,4561274,10,0,nhashem,,,"The National Review is a conservative publication.  It's unfortunate that an interesting hypothesis -- our society is no longer innovating and advancing as much as it used to -- is backed up by obviously conservative partisan points that are loosely based in fact at best, or otherwise complete fabrications.  I was actually tempted to flag this post but instead, I think it will be more productive to respond.<p>The power of government over private enterprises is the ability to guide innovation that may not provide any benefits in the short-term.  There is a line of thinking that any spending on government projects is wasteful and inefficient, and for established technologies, that's true.  I wouldn't want to have a government search engine instead of Google/Bing/Yahoo/DDG/et al all pushing themselves to get better and better.  But do they exist without ARPANET?  Does SpaceX exist without NASA?  I doubt it.<p>Also, for government spending on technology projects, the ROI is not based on the single project's performance but any ancillary benefits as well.  Even if you think spending billions of dollars just to put a man on the moon is a waste, I doubt you can argue with the other technological innovation that spawned as a result (often by the private sector), such as LEDs, artifical limbs[0].<p>And for Thiel to address stagnant wages without mentioning income equality is so completely disingenuous.  This graph -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IncomeInequality7.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IncomeInequality7.svg</a> -- represents exactly what Thiel is talking about, except notice how two of the lines didn't plateau but increased quite dramatically.  Did Thiel's wages only increase 0.7% per year?  Again, I doubt it.<p>My opinion is that the dramatic tax cuts starting in the 1980s have fed this income inequality, because the current design of our private sector is pretty much optimized to concentrate wealth.  As a software engineer, if you've delivered a project that brought them thousands or millions of additional profits with little to no impact on your paycheck, there ya go.  For our profession we're wisening up to not tolerating this (such as Patrick McKenzie's blog posts[1]), but other people aren't so lucky.<p>For some sobering data points, look at these two graphs showing average Fortune 500 CEO pay from 1989 to now, and the value of the S&P 500 from 1989 to now -- <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-pay-20-year-historical-chart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/12/ceo-pay-20-year-historic...</a> <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=626307&startdate=1%2F1%2F1989&enddate=Sep+24%2C+2012&num=30&ei=671fUIiaLsigiALBeA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=626307&sta...</a>.  The S&P 500 is up about 550% during this time, and so is CEO compensation.  So our executives have had their paychecks increase exactly as much as the value of their companies, and the typical worker gets their annual 2.7% raise that barely beats inflation and gets fucked.  Stagnant wages have nothing to do with the ""end of the future,"" they have to do with executives getting paid in stock, thus need to optimize quarterly profits, thus have a <i>direct incentive</i> to pay their employees as little as possible because that would decrease profits, and thus their stock price.  Henry Ford paid his employees well above the market rate at the time because he wanted them to be able to buy his cars -- that brand of capitalist is pretty much endangered now, and now a CEO sharing $3 million with his employees is considered big news[2].<p>Lastly, how does Thiel not mention the impact of corporate donations to political campaigns as hamstringing innovations?  You think all the oil companies are just twiddling its thumbs, assuming at some point we'll stop wanting to run on our cars by burning prehistoric goo and they'll just shut down the business and go golfing?  No, they're making sure as many politicians as it can will protect its interests, and that means pretty much blocking any government investment in renewable energy whenever possible.  Do you think Mitt Romney is against Obama's new car MPG efficiency standards because of ""onerous regulations,"" or that it will lead to less profits for his Republican friends at Haliburton?[5]<p>Obama's much maligned ""stimulus"" -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[3] -- allocated $27 billion towards renewable energy.   While Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity smugly bring up Solyndra every time they can, they don't mention how the US increased the total amount of renewable energy production more in 2009-2011 than it did from 2002-2008[4].  Makes me wonder how much farther we'd be if we still lived in the days where we lauded the government for for making major technological bets that paid off with things like nuclear power, space travel, and the internet, instead of calling it ""out of control government spending"" in order to justify more tax cuts.<p>Sorry to go all Rachel Maddow on you.  For what it's worth, I'm not a communist or a socialist.  I believe strongly in the free market and private enterprise.  In the technology sector, we see countless examples of free market principles and competition giving us faster software, smarter phones, and cheaper computers.<p><i>But I've always seen this as complementary to innovation funded by government.</i>  If VCs as we know them today existed in the 1960s, can you imagine one of them scratching his chin and saying, ""So you want to put a man on the moon.  How are you going to make money?  Actually, don't worry about that, I'm sure it'll be awesome, here's billions of dollars.""<p>I tried to write a TL;DR here trying to sum up my points in this wall of text, but the TL;DR itself ended up being -- yep, too long -- so I'm just going to go with this:<p>TL;DR: There's a lot of misinformation in Thiel's article that ended up reading to me as mostly conservative partisan bullshit, and I already get enough exposure to Fox News every time I visit my wife's parents.<p>[0] <a href=""http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/tech_benefits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2008/tech_benefits.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-gives-3-million-in-bonuses-to-employees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-g...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009#Energy_efficiency_and_renewable_energy_research_and_investment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestm...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States#Current_trends"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_...</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/28/744811/romney-opposes-fuel-efficiency-standards-actually-moving-us-toward-energy-independence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/28/744811/romney-op...</a>",1348454110

Honduras does not have untouched expanses of territory awaiting homesteaders to lay claim.

The huge majority of their lands has been taken over by businessmen and drug traffickers, mostly, they explain, through violence and fraud. The measurement would be a first step in recovering possession of the land.<p>The Vallecito community was surrounded by armed bands firing off weapons through the night.  A group of heavily armed paramilitaries snuck into the middle of a Garifuna drumming circle, made their presence known and left, the death threat established with clarity.  The armed bands have continued to circle the community.<p>The scene was typical of the region since the 1992 Land Modernization Law unleashed paramilitaries against agrarian communities. The law altered the Agrarian Reform Law from the 1960s, which prohibited the resale of land acquired through the agrarian reform program.  Businessmen and drug traffickers, with deep ties to the military intelligence death squads infamous for political killings in the 1980s, used armed bands and other forms of coercion to force Garifuna and campesino communities to sell their land, illegally, and used their political clout to maintain control of the land despite the illegal title transfers.</i><p><a href=""http://www.globalresearch.ca/privately-owned-charter-cities-in-honduras-entire-urban-areas-handed-over-to-corporations/?print=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalresearch.ca/privately-owned-charter-cities-...</a>",1348453636

If the general behaviour is not to abort and unwind, it's not a good fit for an exception.<p>It's also why exception handlers should be very rare. There shouldn't be any more than a half-dozen in most programs. Error codes that need checking and aborting by hand at every function call boundary are a poor fit for replacing exceptions, because they optimize for the case where the error can be handled, rather than the usual case for exceptions, where the error cannot be handled.",1348452209

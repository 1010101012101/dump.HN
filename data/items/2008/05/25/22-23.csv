I guess it's conforting to think that what you never heard of in your ""formal teaching environment"" doesn't exist or doesn't matter. School can only expose so many topics to you. It can go deeper than necessary in some topics that won't be relevant to you and completely ignore others that would be.",1211755003

One is a WW2 codebreaker, and his grandson is a startup tech guy.  The book tells the story by switching between 1940s and 1990s.  Lots of historical people, alternate timeline stuff.  Lots of interesting ideas about economics and information.  A great read.",1211754592

There's no other way to assess programming ability than programming, it's really that simple.  If you hire an unknown programmer without making him submit a code sample, then you deserve what you get because you're gambling and likely to lose.  The whole point is to find <i>good</i> programmers, and good programmers <i>enjoy</i> programming, they'll happily write a trivial program to prove it, <i>happily</i>.

As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, my wrist pain is caused by inflamed neck and shoulder muscles. Anything which builds torso strength can improve your posture and solve a lot of second- and third-order problems.<p>Plus, exercise helps muscles heal and stay healed. They like moving around. Exercise helps keep the blood and lymph flowing through muscles, both directly (I believe that moving around keeps fluids sloshing about and causes blood to be directed to the moving muscles) and indirectly (exercise builds cardiovascular health, which leads to better circulation and oxygenation). It even improves your sleep, which has many excellent side effects.",1211754335

The pains in my arms and wrists were due entirely to postural problems in my shoulders and neck, which was pinching the nerves leading to my wrists. If I'd kept self-diagnosing I'd have tried keyboard after keyboard, wrist braces, less wrist strain... and have completely missed the small adjustments to my monitor and my chair that actually make the difference.<p>Plus, PTs can prescribe proper massage, therapy, ultrasound and/or drugs to speed up your healing.",1211754013

But organizations are unwilling to put this scientific knowledge into use.""<p>I think that's the confirmation bias at work. If such an organization learns that a PhD-holder is real good the reaction will be: ""<i>Well what do you expect, it's a PhD</i>!"" but facing a successful self-taught person they'd say: ""<i>How did he manage to do that without a degree?

199761,comment,199279,199747,0,0,natrius,,,"Actually, I think the reason so much attention is paid to which races earn PhDs or end up in jail is to find out how to increase the number of PhDs of other races or reduce the prison population of certain races. If those differences are caused by genetic differences, then there's nothing we can do to change that. There are other factors at work in both situations, like socioeconomic status and culture, which we can use to make everyone better off.<p>I think socioeconomic status is a better predictor of criminality than race. With that said, if I'm walking through an unfamiliar neighborhood, race is one of the few variables I have to work with. Unfortunately, in America, race is a moderately effective indicator of socioeconomic status, so I would use it as one factor in judging my safety. Even then, I usually use clothes and appearance rather than race to judge one's propensity for crime.<p>This is actually a more interesting problem in terms of what to tell children than racial differences in intelligence. I think by the time they're old enough to be somewhere without adult supervision, they are able to determine what looks like a poor area or poor person and act accordingly. I can see the logic that would lead someone to tell their kids to use race as such a proxy instead, but the consequences of doing so make it not worth the negligible increase in safety in my opinion.",1211753295

In the future I'll try and limit myself to a fifth grade reading level (maybe reaching rhetorical, which is a fancy word for a skillful kind of speech, heights of seventh or eighth grade level) so that the idiotic (for you mouth-breathers, idiotic is a big cloudy multisyllabalic way of saying dumb that fails to add brevity, or cadence or coherence) Techcrunch half of this forum can follow along without having to use a dictionary to find a word they don't know.<p>""Autodidact"" is obscure?  WTF?  Where is this coming from?  Did everyone come here right after watching the American Gladiator contest?  Did we get an influx of Time Magazine readers?<p>For me, the goal of writing here is to practice at playing with ideas.  If, in playing with ideas I use words that are (maybe, a little) obscure, and I fail to communicate to people who seem to me like idiots, well, I'm fine with that.  Great, actually.  If only the failure to communicate ran both ways.<p>I'm done being autodidactic.

Cuill assumes that you can make a comparable search system more efficiently. Powerset assumes that more pertinent results have higher value. Scalability isn't an issue for Cuill. Cuill's president is Anna Paterson, who is partly responsible for Google's scalability.<p>Anyhow, Cuill and Powerset both have scope to make systems which are more efficient and could therefore be supported by less intrusive advertising. The switch from AltaVista to Google was influenced by the intrusiveness of advertising. Perhaps this consideration would inflence a subsequent transistion.",1211753103

For example, I was forced to take a few stats courses which I found extremely boring, but recently at work it was incredibly valuable.""<p>I don't think that's the way to go. If learning something is boring, then it's either because you'll never need it or you don't realize you'll ever need it. You can't know if it's boring because of the former or the latter before you really need it.<p>For example, I found math pretty boring in school (beyond 6th grade, say) because I just didn't see what applications it would have in my life even if I knew I wanted to be a programmer and supposedly good math skills were a hard requirement (it only is if the problem-domain you're working on requires math).<p>But now I have some big ideas for my projects and I learned that some fields of mathematics and other disciplines would be a great investment to learn because it would ease or even simply make possible their implementation. So now those topics really look fun to me so it will give me the push I need to learn it all as fast as possible and in an enjoyable way.",1211752930

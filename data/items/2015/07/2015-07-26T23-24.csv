It&#x27;s a very fine line between not respecting authority and not respecting a person.<p>If you disagree with a policeman&#x27;s <i>authority</i>, the correct way to challenge that is to acknowledge that you disagree with them, and respond in a professional manner - formal complaints, courts, whatever. Not by being difficult to them on the side of the road.<p>If you disagree with their treatment of you (respect like a person), the correct way to deal with that still isn&#x27;t to argue on the side of the road. If they aren&#x27;t treating you with respect (as a person), why would you think that getting into a confrontation with them in that environment is going to change their mind? (Have you ever seen a sporting referee change their decision after a player argued with them?)",1437954980

This proved extraordinarily useful for solving crimes, because it could be used both as video evidence and as alibi.<p>In the wake of a growing surveillance world and abuse of authority, this sounds like a <i>great</i> idea to me. Police officers would be much less likely to harm citizens if they know each citizen (might) has their own recording device.

202769,comment,202201,202634,0,0,raganwald,,,"""Do VC's really want to build companies to feel good about themselves, or to show off, or to look better? Only if those companies make money.""<p>I think you misunderstand the VC business. They charge a fee for managing money. Therefore, their business is attracting investment. This is exactly how mutual funds operate as well.<p>Now, they stand to make money when their funds make money through various incentives and so forth. But by far the biggest incentive is that if they have a home run, they get more money invested, which means more management fees.<p>So aren't they incented to make money for their investors?<p>Not really: if they have a string of modest investments, averaging out to making money, they will not attract a lot of capital: the money will flow to the VCs that have name brand hits.<p>Whereas if they have a ton of total and otherwise embarrassing failures but hit one out of the park, they will get a ton of new money when they start another fund.<p>Or if their portfolio companies are the darlings of the press, they will get a ton of new money when they start another fund<p>So...<p>Their strongest incentives are to own companies that get a lot of press and hopefully get a few really press-worthy hits.<p>That is a lot like patronage to me.",1212018639

With the same logic no story should be submitted.<p>I am sure you are going to say but their posts are not subbmited every day. Well that's because they don't write so often something of general interest, which means that TC because of the fact that is writting too many stories they have higher potential of hitting something of general interest more often...<p>I don't see where is the problem",1212017945

The girlfriend also likes the hula hoop game.  Now that I think of it, I like the hula hoop game, too...not so much playing it myself, though.<p>Anyway, the wide array of controller options makes me want to write software for the Wii.  A live music performance system would be wonderful with a Wii-mote, a nunchuk, and the balance board.  I'm a little giddy just thinking about it.  Might be a good time to learn one of those new-fangled music languages...maybe I'll drink the Lisp Kool-aid and go with CLM.",1212017165

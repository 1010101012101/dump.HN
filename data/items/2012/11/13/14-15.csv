If you think that's allowing people to live the high life then you and I have a very different view of what the high life is.<p>9,000 a year (and this after a 40-odd year working life paying tax) for a couple to cover all living costs doesn't stretch to much in the way of hot springs vacations once you've paid for food, heating and so on.<p>Benefits are a safety net, they're not some route to easy luxury. Living on benefits is hard and not a whole bunch of fun. Yes there are some people who abuse them (though fewer than many would think) but that's the price we pay for having that safety net there. To get rid of them would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",1352818779

They didn't make the decision to use an extender like Volt which requires three hydraulic clutches<p>A Volt-like extender requires ZERO clutches.  It requires nothing more than a gas engine driving a generator which charges a battery which powers an electric motor.<p>The reason why the Volt has three clutches is straightforward: unlike Tesla, GM is trying to squeeze all the efficiency it can out of the car by taking advantage of the fact that the car actually has three motors in it.  The Volt runs in four different modes:<p>0. The battery-powered traction motor drives the car (the default).<p>1. The gas engine drives a generator which, with battery support, powers the traction motor to drive the car.<p>2. The generator disengages from the (turned off) gas engine and performs double-duty as a second battery-driven motor.<p>3. The gas engine attaches directly to the drivetrain and helps the traction motor drive the car.<p>Each of these is maximally efficient in different situations.  For example, if the battery is nearly depleted and the traction motor is spinning fast (over 70MPH), a gas engine directly assisting the wheels is more efficient than generating electricity for the traction motor.<p>Here's the dirty secret of the Model S which no one seems to have touched on: despite Tesla's aerodynamic puffery, it's a fairly inefficient electric vehicle.  The EPA rates it at just 89MPGe with its lightest battery, compared to (for example) 98MPGe for the Volt, 99 for the Leaf, and 100 for the C-Max Energi.  The Model S doesn't really need to maximize efficiency because its battery is big enough to handle range anxiety.  But people who really cared about oil independence (as it sounded like you did) would pick the Volt over the Model S.",1352818719

4778252,comment,4772261,4777217,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"It is a bit verbose, you are right. Let me explain why all of these are necessary. (BTW, argparse is almost as verbose [1]).<p>server - this is the section/module. I could grab this from the name of the current module, but that means you must use unique module names, and not change them. Otherwise, your config files would stop working.<p>daemon - required, obviously, since this is the name of the option.<p>type - I can't assume a type for you. By default it is a unicode instance, so you can omit this parameter if that's your use case.<p>cmd_name/cmd_short_name - I can try to assume that cmd_name is the same as the second positional argument, but once again, there could be a conflict. For example, if you want to have options.db.filename and options.log.filename, you can't use cmd_name = 'filename' for both. cmd_short_name is even worse, since here you may want a specific letter to be used (such as an upper case D instead of d). Note that these parameters are optional, since most of your values will likely go in the config file, not on the command line.<p>An alternative API might look like this:<p><pre><code>  define_opt_int('server', 'shutdown_timeout')\n\n  define_opt_bool('server', 'deameon')\n\n  define_opt_cmd_unicode('server', 'pid_file', cmd_name='pid', cmd_short_name='p')\n</code></pre>\nWith a fallback to:<p><pre><code>  define_opt('log', 'level', type=lambda x: x if x in LOG_LEVELS else 'DEBUG', cmd_name='log-level', cmd_short_name='L')\n</code></pre>\nAny feedback is greatly appreciated.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html</a>",1352818627

This is ridiculous. Men and women do buy very markedly different things in general, especially in family life.

Since the government can point to easier access to quality-of-life-enriching items like computers, which fall in price for equivalent goods year over year, it can manipulate the stats and make inflation look very low. This is appropriate for an ""ideal"" household that buys exactly that the CPI index holds.<p>But on the other and someone who buys disproportionally the items that are rising faster than the CPI really does feel a higher inflation rate.<p>It certainly seems conceivable that women tend to buy items that are rising in price faster than the CPI more than men.<p>It's also possible that marketing gimmicks disproportionally target women, with clothing coming to mind for example: perhaps sticker prices rise much faster than inflation, but post-""SALE"" prices don't. This is a gimmick designed to encourage buying of deep sale prices, that may play better in clothing than in other industries, and that thus women fall victim to more.

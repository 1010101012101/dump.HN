7937,comment,6505,6505,0,0,yc1,,,"ok here is a problem:<p>Say you have a great idea (don't we all  :))<p>But we don't know if either TechStars or Y-Combinator will actually accept our idea so to hedge our bets we apply to both. (of course YC is first option).<p>Now TechStars will send their results on Apr 5 and the deadline to accept, I think is Apr14 . This is before the Apr22 date when YC decides which companies it will fund.<p>So on Apr14: if you are one of the really good ideas that both TechStars and YC like - because of the timeline - you get into a dilema: if u say no to TechStars there is no guarantee that YC will accept u but if u say yes to TechStars - then u give up on your first choice without even getting a chance to hear the YC results.<p>Seems like a cunning way for TechStars to get all the best ideas this summer before YC can get them.
(I bet they try to pull this off every six months to try and steal all the best ideas...)<p>So, YC needs think about how to solve this potential issue - (maybe bringin the dates of their decisions??)",1175398322

4590677,comment,4589971,4590292,2,0,lostlogin,,,"Something that has hit me more times than is ideal is opening times. A surprising number of travel guides do odd things like say 'open Tuesday to Sunday, closed 1st Sunday of the month.'\nAt a quick skim its easy to miss the 2 key things, closed some Sundays, closed all\nMondays. And unhelpfully the format of the information is often inconsistent within the same publication. Invariably the info is out of date anyway, and prices are considerably higher than the guides states. We usually used Lonely Planet or Rough Guide, but the lack of up to date opening times was a continual pain (out of date prices is annoying, but you can spend more and get in, but if the place is closed, you're stuck).",1348948646

4590672,comment,4589431,4590199,6,0,neilxdsouza,,,"I am an Indian (from Goa). Your idea that the millions of Software Engineers from India are going bridge the gap is misguided, IMO.<p>What Software innovation has India done? Do you know of any compiler companies from here? Or any Operating System companies? How many linux kernel engineers does Infosys or TCS have? Both companies are sitting with billions in cash. Do you think any senior directors there are thinking - let's create a microchip, even if it's way behind Intel or AMD? I remember reading an interview of Bjarne Stroustrup - he said AT&T gave away their compilers to their competitors (like HP) knowing fully well it would strengthen them. Is any company in India on the same level as AT&T, who can see the bigger picture ? Maybe Tata's come close (not TCS). Indian senior management are like glorified buniyas - who when they put down 50 paise, expect Rs 1.5 back. It took Standard Chartered to come to India and sponsor a marathon. That should tell you a lot about senior management here.<p>On a larger scale is any Indian company thinking we can build a commercial aircraft? Only HAL builds fighters - but that's a govt company. Soon Microsoft is going to create an opportunity for everyone to erode their Desktop OS share by walling off developers? Do you think TCS or Infosys is building a Linux Distro like Canonical/Ubuntu? Do you think they have the balls to get into that market and try and take market share?<p>The fundamental thinking of India seems to be flawed. Everyone wants a piece of the outsourcing pie. Synergies and bullcrap like that. No products come from here. I believe we are already suffering a much worse fate than Japan. Videocon is a collaboration with a Japanese company (since the talk was about electronic majors from Japan). Where are the real indigenous products from India, so that we can have the same fate as Japan? The only advantage the 1 million ""good"" engineers you claim is cost. Once the cost advantage goes, people are going to be jobless, not bridging any gaps.<p>I went to 2 leading BPOs with my compilers for Survey Programming and Cross Tabulation. The VPs said the thought of writing such products never crossed their minds. They were not interested.<p>If you want to see the difference in Indian thinking - compare with Germany. Open source is available to everyone and that means countries too. I have read many articles about Germany using Open source in govt offices and there was an article about France and Libre Office.<p>India cannot go down the same road as Japan, because we dont have the products in the first place to go down that road.<p>I don't know if your ""bridging the gap"", means supplying engineers to other countries. If yes, then this is the typical thinking that creates the net negative cash flow in economies like ours.",1348948572

Fancy news reading systems (Instapaper, Flipboard, Pulse, etc.) are nice because they strip out all the ads. ""Wow, look how much nicer it looks! We're totally saving journalism."" They aren't.

In other words, I think it's a cop-out to hand wave about technology for this discussion by saying that it can be done in the future.<p>""The point of shooting someone with a weapon that can travel that fast is that you can catch them with their pants down.""<p>The problem with this proposal is your target can easily solve this by randomizing the thrust enough, on the assumption that it might be targeted. Suppose you are 1 AU off and fire at where you expect your target to be in 8 minutes. The difference between 0.01g and 0.0101g is 100 meters after 8 minutes, so even a 1% difference in thrust might be enough to miss the ship. But if you're using firing things at 0.99c then your enemy can likely manage better than 0.01g.<p>You mentioned ""all you have to do is wait until the enemy is sitting in port"".  That ""port"" is a space station, in orbit. Neptune is 4 hours out. If the station is a 1km sphere, then it only need to move by up to about 20km in any direction to make the odds of being hit be less than 1:100. Neptune is 4 hours out. 20km/4 hours is 0.0002m/s/s or 0.00002g.<p>For reference, the ISS orbit decays, due to air resistance, by about 90 meters per day. This is easily restored through occasional boosts. Which means that you, as the enemy, are going to need to fire off thousands of these 0.99c bullets in order to hit your target. Where does all of this energy come from?<p>In any case, with micron sized bullets, you're just going to drill a hole through your target. The exit hole will be pretty much the same as the entrance. Very little of the energy will be deposited into the ship, and it's not likely to take damage anywhere near to the amount of energy you put into trying to hit it.",1348946013

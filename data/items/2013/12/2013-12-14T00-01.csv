6903957,comment,6900004,6903075,3,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Virtual classes with family polymorphism attacks the problem directly: you can add new variants as well as enhance the super class with new abstract methods: your system is abstract until all variants have implemented the abstract methods of the super class. You can then do cool things like factor all your functionality for X in one layer and Y in another layer, replicating variants in X and Y layers to specify their implementations separately.<p>When I did this in Scala (using traits and type parameters in a virtual class pattern), I got a lot of pushback from the FP people, who thought this problem couldn&#x27;t, or more correctly SHOULDN&#x27;T, be solved using object-oriented constructs; it was one of the main things they liked to boast about in how FP was better than OOP, and I literally took that away from them. A 10,000 line pattern match was somehow preferable to a file with 20 traits that described how the new operation was performed per variant. Martin even made my pattern illegal via  a new type check in the Scala compiler after I left EPFL :)",1386982763

These two pads were designed for bigger rockets than any currently flying in the world.  NASA is keeping the other pad not up for bid for it&#x27;s far future SLS system.<p>ULA is Lockheed/Boeing. ULA currently does all US military launches (outside of the small stuff Orbital Sciences puts up). Neither ULA nor Blue Origin have current or publicly known future vehicles that would need this huge pad.<p>The theory is that by going to congress to force NASA to make this a shared pad, SpaceX&#x27;s competitors hope to make the pad all but unusable by SpaceX. If the pad must be shared,  all improvements must be run by all of the other&#x27;s that are &quot;sharing&quot; the pad. Launch times and schedules must also be run by competitors. In addition, everything installed by SpaceX would need to be potentially uninstalled, if a competitor requested the pad for some reason.",1386982596

If you assign some costs to these things, say $500k/yr for the palace, $1mm/yr for security, $500k/yr for motorcade, and $10mm/yr for the jet, you can figure out the annual cost -- $12mm/year in this example. So in a country with only 3.3 million people, that&#x27;s $3.60/citizen/year for the ruling family to have their trappings.  In a country with 310 million people, that would only be $0.038/citizen/year.<p>Even if you need more security, or a bigger motorcade, or a more expensive plane, you&#x27;re still on the magnitude of pennies/person/year instead of dollars/person/year.",1386982509

6903900,comment,6882378,6889551,1,0,csandreasen,,,"Sorry, I wish I had seen your comment two days ago when you posted...<p>I don&#x27;t think Mr. Barker&#x27;s argument was based solely on whether or not the US should be doing it, but also touched upon the journalistic standards behind the reporting.  As an analogy:<p>Headline: Hacker News commentors unfazed by NSA controversy<p><i>Discussion repeatedly turned in favor of the NSA&#x27;s targeting of Islamic extremists on Hacker News, a web forum frequented by many of the internet&#x27;s technical elite.  Summerdown2, a respected contributor, even went so far as to say that &quot;of course the US should do to extremists what Glenn Greenwald does routinely to Republicans.&quot;  Though also mentioning vague concerns regarding NSA surveillance, he stressed that &quot;it&#x27;s hardly controversial that journalists reveal hypocrisy&quot; and even went so far as to say that it was &quot;certainly good journalistic practice.&quot;</i><p>You and I (and anyone else reading this thread) can easily look at the source comments and tell that my hypothetical news blurb is complete bullshit and the crux of your argument was left out entirely.  So if the authors are willing to selectively quote from their expert source to avoid having their argument look bad, what else are they selectively quoting to make their arguments?  This isn&#x27;t like Reuters, AP, ITAR-TASS, Kyodo and half a dozen other major news agencies are on the ground writing about what they see as events unfold - Snowden chose which documents to gather, then chose Greenwald and Poitras specifically to give these documents to.  These guys have the ultimate control over which documents get reported, what parts of the documents get shared with the public, and which documents get shared with which news agencies.  The guy I quoted is stating that he feels Greenwald and the people he is working with had no qualms about selectively quoting from an expert source in order to keep their argument from looking weak.  There&#x27;s little risk to the authors in misquoting Stewart Baker - how many people read his blog?  How many people here on HN know about the blog post before I linked to it?  There&#x27;s almost no risk whatsoever in selectively quoting a document from Snowden to make their point - no one has access to it except for the NSA and whoever Greenwald has allowed access.<p>From the NSA porno article, they pull out a few paragraphs to make their point - what&#x27;s in the rest of the report?  If the information regarding the inconsistency in the public/private lives of those 6 individuals was documented in a &quot;previous SIGINT assessment report&quot;, why are they showing us this report instead of that one?  Was that other report sent to the Departments of Justice, Commerce and the Drug Enforcement Agency, too?  If the information in that other report wasn&#x27;t sent to them, what information on those 6 individuals was in this report that would have been of interest?  Better yet, why can&#x27;t Greenwald just redact the identifying information and let us read the whole damn report for ourselves?<p>And it&#x27;s not just that one.  Here&#x27;s a paragraph from a recent Washington Post article[1]:<p><i>One senior collection manager, speaking on the condition of anonymity but with permission from the NSA, said “we are getting vast volumes” of location data from around the world by tapping into the cables that connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as well as foreign ones. Additionally, data are often collected from the tens of millions of Americans who travel abroad with their cellphones every year.</i><p>I have no idea who is saying what in that paragraph, beyond the fact that an anonymous collection manager said &quot;we are getting vast volumes&quot;.<p>Why were the specific encryption systems that the NSA had compromised and the countries targeted redacted from the source documents that we were shown[2] in the BULLRUN leak?  Everyone&#x27;s up in arms about Dual EC PRNG, but that might not even be what that document was refering to.  It would be trivial for the media to reveal it and end all doubt, but keeping it hidden and instead writing about how the NSA is betraying our trust and compromising the security of the same crypto systems that we all use makes a better headline.<p>Or one could ask why we only got a limited subset of the PRISM slides.  What else is in there?  Why can&#x27;t we see it?  Would that information invalidate their argument?<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tr...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html?ref=us\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-r...</a>",1386982054

I started <a href=\"http://introtopython.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://introtopython.org</a> after watching my students be unsuccessful in most of the existing courses. They need a little more direction than LPTHW offers, and they aren&#x27;t quite ready to keep pace with a Coursera or Udacity course. Some of the key features of introtopython:<p>- It is completely open source. This offers a number of advantages, that I&#x27;d be happy to specify.<p>- It starts with no assumption of prior knowledge. When introtopython is mature, someone who has just heard of Python should be able to install Python on their own system, and start working through the lessons and exercises, and progress straight through to the Projects.<p>- It has a short series of Exercises and Challenges after each new topic. As these grow in number and quality, there should be room for people who need more practice on each topic to progress slowly through the topics, while students who learn faster can progress at their own pace.<p>- As the collection of projects grows, the site can be useful to more experienced programmers as well. I am looking forward to writing a section on Django. Someone who already knows Python but hasn&#x27;t used Django might find just the writeup on Django really useful. A better example might be the Basemap example that has already been written. If you know Python but haven&#x27;t used matplotlib or Basemap, you might really like this writeup: <a href=\"http://introtopython.org/visualization_earthquakes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://introtopython.org/visualization_earthquakes.html</a>",1386982007

It’s worth considering whether, in fact, it is younger workers in their 20s and 30s who are more likely to be actively searching for opportunities to move across jobs in an effort to develop a portfolio of marketable skills and experiences. Older workers are really looking for a company where their considerable skills and experiences are valued and can make a difference.</i><p>One concern tha jumps out (i&#x27;m sure to many) is the reference to a measurement of &quot;future comittment&quot;, which seems at best unpredictable.

6903733,comment,6901805,6901925,1,0,jfarmer,,,"My educated guess is that, broadly speaking, there are three classes of people reading something on Casetext: (1) the people raising, (2) investors, and (3) the attorneys advising them.  Let&#x27;s assume for now that all three groups roughly are familiar with the usual parameters of a convertible note.<p>I would fall into bucket (1), but right now it seems optimized for (3).  As an entrepreneur, I&#x27;m primarily interested in seeing what other people have to say about the document, especially folks in (2) and (3).  I want to know where and how it differs from a usual note, to whom those difference matters, and why it matters.  I expect the bulk of the comments to be coming from investors and attorneys since they see so many more documents like this on a weekly basis than entrepreneurs, which means I want to see what they have to say.<p>As I was using the site, I noticed myself doing a few things.  First, I was primarily looking to see where other people commented and what they had to say.  Second, whenever I saw someone had made a comment, I&#x27;d stop and read — especially if it was someone I knew.  Third, when I was done reading the comments, I&#x27;d want to scroll to the next one.<p>The overall experience for someone who wants to do these things is a little frustrating.  For example, when I expand a comment section all the other sections disappear until I close it again.  This tripped me up at least 3-4 times, where I&#x27;d start scrolling, realize everything else was hidden, scroll back up, and hit close.  Think about it: if there aren&#x27;t any other &quot;expand section&quot; links when I expand my first section then there&#x27;s no way for me to know the difference between a paragraph with no comments and a paragraph with comments but where the &quot;expand section&quot; link is hidden.  Indeed, in that scenario I don&#x27;t even know the latter exists!  What&#x27;s worse, if the comment section is particularly long, like the very first comment section in this document, I&#x27;ll be dumped into some random place in the document when I hit close and suddenly see before me a bunch of &quot;expand comment&quot; buttons.  The first thing I do?  Scroll all the way back up to the top to find the first one after the comments I just finished reading.<p>I can think of several small tweaks that might aid this.  First, put little marks in the scrollbar on the left indicating where the comment section is.  Second, if someone scrolls past a paragraph while a comment section is open, automatically close the other section.  Third, try to find some way to allow the &quot;expanding&quot; behavior without hiding the other &quot;expand section&quot; link. I realize this is a little tricky since in theory the comment section could take up more vertical space than the paragraph it&#x27;s commenting on, so the obvious solutions would require the comment sections to overlap, add space between the paragraphs in the document, or insert a scroll bar inside the section.  Fourth, allow some kind of &quot;next/previous section&quot; navigation, using either a pair of buttons/links somewhere on the page or a keyboard shortcut, e.g., left/right arrow.<p>Anyhow, those are just my off-the-cuff remarks!  I think the product is really neat and I wish I had annotations like this for contracts where these concerns had to be spelled out to me over time by many parties.",1386980216

He was impressed.  He tried to for months to convince AC Propulsion to commercialize the electric vehicle and even asked them to make one for him, but they had no interest in doing so.  Instead, Tom Gage, the president of AC Propulsion introduced Musk and Straubel to another team that shared the same interest so that they together they could increase their potential for success in commercializing an electric vehicle.   The other team included Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning and Ian Wright.</i><p>[...]<p><i>Fortunately, one day Wright&#x27;s neighbor, Martin Eberhard, started to chat about having just incorporated a electric car manufacturing company.  Wright thought the idea was far-fetched but did the neighborly thing and offered to take a look at Eberhard’s business plan.</i><p>[...]<p><i>They joined forces that year and formed Tesla Motors Inc.  Straubel became CTO, Eberhard became CEO, Marc Tarpenning became CFO, and Elon Musk became the Chairman and the Head of Product Design.  Ian Wright became Tesla Motors’ first employee as VP of Vehicle Development.  Musk provided the majority of funds for the startup with $7.5 million of his own personal cash in the first round of capital investment as well as contributing to subsequent rounds.</i> [2]<p>1 - <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10357665-54.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10357665-54.html</a><p>2 - <a href=\"http://teslarumors.com/HowTeslaBegan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://teslarumors.com/HowTeslaBegan</a>",1386980055

They made partnerships with Mozilla and AutoDesk to deliver AutoDesk tools in the browser, their demos also look pretty cool though I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s their commercial offer gonna be, likely not the full stack like mainframe2 ..",1386979847

6903650,comment,6903223,6903223,13,0,tikhonj,,,"Pandoc is a wonderful tool and by extension a wonderful library. It takes a simple idea--convert between different document formats--and executes it very well. It then turns out that this simple idea is extremely handy.<p>This article about the API shows how it uses a great design: the actual tool is written as a frontend to a generic library. This way, the actual logic is not tied to the frontend at all; the dependency flows from the logic to the interface. Since it&#x27;s designed as a library first, the API is a first-class citizen. Using it never feels like scripting an app, because it isn&#x27;t.<p>I really like this way of separating concerns. It makes the &quot;meat&quot; of the program so much more useful and reusable. Moreover, there is no reason not to use this approach for GUI apps as well, but I see it all too rarely.<p>It would be particularly nice for IDEs. There&#x27;s no reason why all the great refactoring and analysis tools need to be tied to a given frontend. I&#x27;d rather have the two clearly split to make the backend much easier to reuse and repurpose.<p>This sort of design is implicitly encouraged by Haskell (as in the case of Pandoc). The language naturally pushes you to carefully split the logic and the interface, partly through managing IO explicitly. Even the build tool pushes you in this direction, making it very easy to build both a library and an executable at the same time. Of course, this is also very easy to do in other languages, although I&#x27;ve found it a bit easier to mix concerns in an OOP setting. It&#x27;s just too easy to add a render method to your Document class instead of maintaining a strict separation; this is especially true if Document contains extensive private state.<p>I really hope future tools will continue with this sort of split design so that building new things on top of them continues to be easy. I&#x27;ve already benefited from this with Pandoc: the static site generator I use is built on top of Pandoc, giving it some very nice capabilities. Since it uses Pandoc as a library, it&#x27;s more powerful than just passing files through the tool--the configuration can also use and depend on variables in the Pandoc templates, for example, which is very useful and requires  programmatic access to Pandoc&#x27;s internals.",1386979270

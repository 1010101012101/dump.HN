Node is an interesting technical achievement, but programming in javascript on the server is not going to create the most robust environment.<p>I think you should definitely ask about Go, but given that you&#x27;re new, unless you&#x27;re going into a technical lead position, be aware that they may have already made up their minds, and might not be open to different ideas.

When you&#x27;re right about something in the sense of not being ignorant, you understand all the discussions and news easily, you know exactly what everyone is talking about, including reading academic articles on the subject, etc.  When you&#x27;re wrong about something your wrongness butts up against the correct model again and a gain and you&#x27;re often left confused or unable to understand the actions, discussions, arguments, and conclusions, of others. (As opposed to seeing specific places they are wrong.)  You can feel this lack of understanding.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel the same way as properly understanding a subject at all.<p>I would argue that this review is saying that the author&#x27;s understanding falls a little short of par for the course.

7597143,comment,7595381,7596780,1,0,rdl,,,"The class of things I hate the most (having applied to YC, etc.) is when a bad <i>application</i> masks what is otherwise a good or potentially great team.  That&#x27;s something you can learn not to do, and which can be corrected with some coaching.<p>1) People fuck up videos frequiently.  I&#x27;ve personally been studying &quot;how to do good kickstarter videos&quot; a lot, but &quot;how to do a 2-3 minute Demo Day pitch&quot; and &quot;how to do a 1 minute YC app video&quot; are pretty specific, and while a lot of it should be obvious, it isn&#x27;t all obvious.<p>The problem is, doing a good &quot;how to do a YC video&quot; is itself best communicated as video, with good/bad examples, so it&#x27;s a fair bit of work -- it would probably take a couple people a week to do very well.<p>2) Sometimes, people &quot;bury the lede&quot; and hide the most salient parts of their project deep inside an application in a non-clear way.  Sometimes it isn&#x27;t even listed.  I&#x27;ve talked to friends who want to apply to YC who intentionally couched their whole application in &quot;corporate speak&quot;, focused entirely on top-down analysis, etc., rather than actually explaining why the product is good, why they&#x27;re interested in it, etc.<p>3) There are a lot of items which are hard to verify, and which lose their predictive value as soon as they&#x27;re widely known.  Similar to the well-known interview questions (&quot;what is your greatest weakness?&quot; being a pathological example), where once they become common knowledge, the only value is knowing who prepared ahead of time vs. who didn&#x27;t, or who is willing to recite something which sounds convincing vs. actually thinking about it.<p>I&#x27;m afraid the Thiel question &quot;what is something you believe to be true which isn&#x27;t widely held&quot; is becoming that question today.<p>X) My personal belief is that something like a YC app should be fractal -- good on the surface if you skim it for 10-30 seconds, but then just as good when you read it closely in any area without greater context.  That&#x27;s a specific style, and not universal, and I don&#x27;t know if the YC Partnership agrees with me.  The applications get reviewed many times (with some rejected at each step), and ultimately if you&#x27;re on the bubble and the application gets debated internally, you want it to help you just as much as it did when it was initially screened.  (Obviously, it&#x27;s better to just be so amazing that you&#x27;re well in the &quot;yes&quot; range and not seriously debated...)",1397648649

7597112,comment,7596922,7596922,22,0,Theodores,,,"Reminds me of a highly accurate clock used in broadcasting. This clock sends out a time signal around the building to various clocks on walls and equipment, e.g. &#x27;VT machines&#x27; (or whatever is used now).<p>I had the pleasure of adjusting this clock for GMT/BST twice a year. The great thing about this clock was that it did not actually tell the time itself. One would have to walk out of the machine room and through a couple of corridors, up a flight of stairs and into a gallery to actually see the alleged time with one&#x27;s own eyes. All it had was a MODEM socket hidden in the back of a 19U rack, with the wires in U.S. configuration rather than what we have in the U.K.<p>So, to change the time you could &#x27;conveniently&#x27; solder up a lead that would actually connect to the box, telnet in, remembering to get the password right, then set the time zone using the obscure command procedure provided.<p>This would be a simple enough task, however, there would be two of these clocks and they would talk to each other. So changing the time on one would not be good enough, the other would correct it or set it ahead/back by another hour. For added convenience the other &#x27;master&#x27; clock would be in an entirely different part of the building and need to stay &#x27;on&#x27; the whole time.<p>When it comes to extreme horology, I think that the most stupendously over-the-top accurate timepieces should not actually be able to tell the time with something as cheap and tacky as a display. If the time does have to be displayed then it should be in UNIX epoch time as that is the most convenient for all concerned.",1397647685

If someone sends me a document or a file or something and I need to do something with it and send it back, it&#x27;s hopeless. There isn&#x27;t enough of a filesystem to do that sort of stuff with it. The whole WP isolated storage thing is painful and really ruins it for me. Not only that if someone sends me a media file or I download an mp3 for example I can only see it within scope of the app that received it and never can I add it to my music library without connecting it to a PC. I can&#x27;t even play it without blocking the entire phone UI.<p>2. I really don&#x27;t want to have to sign in at all and/or activate my phone as a developer device to deploy any apps or even a simple one shot custom app I&#x27;ve written for my own use. Occasionally, historically with WM6.5 and predecessors I&#x27;ve built the odd diagnostic tool that sits on the device. I can do the same in HTML on a web server somewhere but that relies on a network connection to be there, which even though I live in London isn&#x27;t always the case. In fact it&#x27;s pretty terrible in the suburbs. On basic GPRS WP is heading towards useless.<p>3. Android USB OTG is awesome. I can move stuff between USB sticks, plug keyboards in and all sorts. This has got me out of the crap a few times already and I&#x27;ve only had an Android handset for about a month now. The cable that enabled all this cost me (including delivery) £0.73.<p>4. Nokia made awesome hardware. Not joking it was the best stuff out there. Since the Lumia 820 though, it&#x27;s turned to crap. I have repaired a number of handsets and they aren&#x27;t designed with durability in mind any more and the parts are quite difficult to get hold of unless you&#x27;re Nokia authorised service.

I can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re motivated by greed or a particularly poorly thought out world view.<p>Also, why are you claiming this is somehow specific to unconfirmed transactions? Corrupt miners can also rewrite the block chain. If you get paid enough and have enough hash power, why not see if you can overtake the chain head? So don&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s somehow specific to unconfirmed transactions. It isn&#x27;t.<p>Bitcoin fundamentally assumes that the majority of mining power is &quot;honest&quot;, defined to mean following the rules laid down by Satoshi in the core software. You can see this by simply reading the white paper:<p>&quot;The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.&quot;<p>(last sentence, first page)<p>You are attempting to bribe miners to become &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;attack the network&quot; in Satoshi&#x27;s language. If enough people did what you suggest, the system&#x27;s fundamental assumption would be invalidated and the entire network would break. If merely a small number of people do it, it just makes the system unreliable, untrustworthy and pushes people towards centralised fixes like payment processors that levy higher fees, trusted third parties that prevent double spending, secure hardware, etc. All things that increase Bitcoin&#x27;s costs and reduce its competitiveness vs regular banking. Doing this doesn&#x27;t help anyone or prove any point, it just adds sand into an otherwise useful system by increasing transaction costs.<p>tl;dr you are like a kid kicking down someone&#x27;s sandcastle on a beach, then saying &quot;they should have been guarding it better, anyone could have done what i did!&quot;.",1397646900

I think the product concept translates well and is easy to understand. Since you focus most of the pitch on it, it seems like a pitch for users.<p>If you&#x27;re pitching to investors, a few things need to be sharpened / clarified -<p>* You say &quot;0 marketing spend&quot; - which most investors will call bullshit on that. Typically, what you really mean is that you spent nothing on ads. Unless you consider your time as worthless, you probably spent quite a bit on marketing. Even if you have the most viral product in the world, you need to kickstart it until it reaches critical mass. Investors want to know that you&#x27;ve given some thought on how to scale that operation (and not that you&#x27;ll spend 0 on marketing going forward).<p>* Regarding marketing, you briefly mention that user acquisition is built into the product. You need to elaborate a little bit on that, cause right now it&#x27;s not clear how that is the case.<p>* Dates on the x-axis of the user growth graph would be helpful. Did that growth happen mostly after the public launch or during the closed beta? most people would assume the latter unless you tell them otherwise.<p>* At the end you briefly group together your recruiting needs and fundraising goals. Depending on the audience, I would focus on one. If fundraising interest is the goal of the pitch, put a dedicated slide on that, and move the hiring part to a footnote on the team slide. If it&#x27;s the reverse, do the opposite.<p>* I would make the contact details at the end way larger, and move it higher. In addition, it&#x27;s always good practice to put the name of the company, a tagline and basic contact details in the header of every slide - for people who lost concentration, or want to put a note for themselves before you reach the last slide. Btw, it should be in header and not the footer, because sometimes people&#x27;s heads obscure the bottom of the deck during presentations (depending on how the seats are arranged). That is also why you should move the contact details at the end higher, just in case.<p>* Again, investor audience only - add a slide about the market / opportunity size. Especially if you&#x27;re aiming for a series A round, which typically means venture capital.<p>Hope this helps!",1397646453

After more than two weeks of trying to get help from DHL support, I gave up. That is, I gave up on their support, not on getting my package. The initial problem was my fault: I&#x27;d supported a Kickstarter campaign ages ago, and the result (two Parallella computers...) finally shipped. To my old office address, where it was rejected, and returned to DHLs depot.<p>DHL support insisted the local courier still had it, despite the fact the local courier had a signature that said otherwise. Then they went quiet. They stopped replying to e-mail entirely.<p>So I made DHL execs provide support.<p>I signed up for LinkedIn Premium, and spent half an hour scouring LinkedIn for the highest ranking DHL execs I could find (no easy job - the number of SVP&#x27;s they have is staggering), and mailed 3 of them with my gripe.<p>I didn&#x27;t really expect much help, but two of them grabbed the opportunity to defuse the situation and find out more about what had gone wrong, and fix it. Between them they got the right people looking into the matter, and assorted customer care people both at DHLs headquarters in Germany, and their local (to me) team in the UK were told that a certain SVP wanted to know what was going on and be kept informed. 4 business days from I bypassed their entire support organization and about 5 levels of management (at a guess) the package finally arrived at my desk.<p>It&#x27;s great that they cared. But I went this route because I found <i>no other way</i> to get hold of anyone. When support first ignored me, I e-mailed their press contacts, their sales teams, and every other address I could easily find on their site. Nothing. Total silence. My frustration was intense, and I&#x27;m sure other customers must have fallen through the cracks too.<p>If said execs, which did include a person in charge for a large division of their support team, had spent any time &quot;on the floor&quot; answering support requests, I suspect they&#x27;d have a very different picture of their organisation, and maybe my rather unusual approach wouldn&#x27;t have been necessary.<p>(so I&#x27;m going to take this approach whenever I get inadequate support from now on...)",1397646295

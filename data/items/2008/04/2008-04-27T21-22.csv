175068,comment,174966,174966,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Sounds like a mis-communication between recruiter and one or both other sides (whatever Google team the recruiter was recruiting for and the applicant).<p>Of course, it's true that Google has been on a headcount reduction bent for over a year for some departments (and headcount has been capped for many others).  It's not been implemented as a total hiring freeze, though...they're just not replacing people who leave those departments.  Perhaps one of those departments failed to notify their recruiter that they no longer had new openings.",1209333422

175051,comment,174859,175039,0,0,wheels,,,"I think the thing that this article, and a lot of rhetoric in general assumes, is that Africa is Africa.  There are some amazingly developed parts of Africa with stable economies, legal systems and technology infrastructures.  I would expect any outside investment to start in those countries and radiate to the surrounding ones.  So while I wouldn't bet on a startup scene popping up in Somalia, it could happen in Botswana.<p>The factor that I think what you're saying misses is:  cheap labor.  Combined with a high-prevalence of spoken English among the educated, I think it's possible that businesses would be willing to consider operations in Africa.",1209331631

175046,comment,174859,174859,0,0,wumi,,,"in general, the argument he's making could go for any town, in the US, or otherwise, not just African nations.<p>There are some things that are very difficult to change, and one is culture. (""face your studies"")<p>For several sub-saharan African nations there's an emphasis put on schooling, and a few of those companies mentioned (read: MSFT and Facebook) would never have happened in cultures that don't respect people without college degrees.<p>Sure in the US, there's not much that respect for a drop-out either, but on the other hand it's not seen as insane to drop-out or to even start a business simultaneously while in school.<p>secondly, the entrepreneurial start-up mindset in America had it's beginnings somewhere, and in the subset branch of web 2.0/ software-based start-ups, just one company can literally change the whole game and influence myriads of others to come.<p>Intel, Microsoft, Facebook in 2004. The story of Zuck and Fbook has resonated in the heads of youths across the country, and one can point to him as an example of what could be.<p>All that's really needed for any region, or any university (for every Stanford there are a few hundred univerisites that produce no software start-ups of any consequence) is for one run-away success, and the rest will follow.",1209331238
175045,comment,174298,174388,0,0,Brendon,,,"Thanks for the plug Parveen (I'm one of the guys behind Bootup Labs)<p>To elaborate on SRED and IRAP: These are programs that will either offset tax on revenue, or provide direct grants for original research and development. Talking with one of the local CTOs up here, he said use of these two programs basically cut his development costs by 70 to 80% versus Silicon Valley. Basically, there's a fair amount of free government money to be had to get you going, or stretch your funding further.<p>I actually just returned here from Silicon Valley (lived in Mountain View for four years). There's a couple reasons I did, mostly because Silicon Valley is an echo chamber that confuses motion with progress, but also because Vancouver has a lot to offer:<p>1) Diverse population ethnicity: if you're thinking about going into China, India, or Europe, it helps to have a lot of local knowledge of those cultures.<p>2) Lots of local talent: For one, the largest Electronics Arts development center in the world. For a second, a number of ""Silicon Valley"" companies and thought leaders - Tim Bray (creator of XML), Flock (has a team of 20 devs on Vancouver Island), Lloyd Budd (Automattic), many others.<p>3) Healthy life: I lost 15 pounds in two months when I returned to Vancouver, without really changing much. The city is a walking city, so we have only used a single tank of gas in th past four months. There's lots of cheap transit.<p>4) Close to Silicon Valley: YVR is actually the largest airport on the west coast (not LAX). You can be in Silicon Valley in two hours. I often joked with my valley friends that I could fly to Vancouver and drive to Whistler faster than they could get to Lake Tahoe. ;-)<p>As for living expense - overall, it's about the same as Silicon Valley. Some stuff costs more, some stuff less. The stuff that does cost more, you usually get a lot more bang for your buck. $800K will get you a shack in Mountain View, or a brand new modern apartment in downtown Vancouver in the heart of the action.",1209331110

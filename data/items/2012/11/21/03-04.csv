Maybe a handful that got me as excited as Settlers did.<p>In general, people don't make fun ""deep"" games for the iPhone, they make them for the Console/PC.   Any studio making something fun and free for the iPhone is probably more interested in extracting $$$ as quickly as possible from you, particular where you see the dreaded IAP.  I'll try out Clash of Clans and see if it falls into that dreaded _suck the player in and force him to pay cash_.  I suspect there will be Gems that I have to drop $$$ into in order to speed up building things instead of waiting 30 minutes.  We'll see.<p>[Edit: 3 minutes later.  Installed it.  You need Gems to finish building things in reasonable (<5 minutes, in the case of a Gold storage, 30 minutes. ) time.  My guess is the entire purpose of this game is to suck me in to the point at which I start shoveling money for IAP - doesn't this pattern annoy people?  Or is it just because they haven't seen it dozens (hundreds?) of times before?  I'll play with it for another 10 minutes, but so far, the game pattern looks pretty straight forward and not particularly entertaining or engrossing.  I'll try and keep an open mind.]<p>[Edit 2: I'm sorry - I lasted all of 5 minutes with this thing.  Buy Gems.  Speed up Building.   You can even use Gems to Acquire more ""Gold"" or more ""Elixir"" - they don't even attempt to hide the mechanics of cash extraction.  It's almost a straightforward ""Give us Cash and you can build things really fast and go attack others and win.""  Probably the shortest time any game has ever lasted on my iPhone, ever.

Specifically, it's a common factor in the process that ultimately leads to the collapse of complex societies.<p>Read the book 'Collapse of complex societies' by Tainter. It's a study of failed human societies throughout history, and the common factors in their process of collapse. Yes, it turns out there is a single, driving common factor. Complex societies go into violent, chaotic and permanent collapse, at the point when their available resources (of all kinds, including manpower, energy, knowledge, food, water, etc) become less than the resources required to maintain the social infrastructure. At that point there's a rapid structural implosion, with failing infrastructure leading to inability to allocate resources to maintain the infrastructure - a positive feedback process that bites hard. Usually, almost everyone dies.<p>The snowball can begin when some external challenge requires an extra expenditure of resources - which are not available. Or it can begin simply because the social structure grows too complicated and parasitic, thus exceeding physical limits. Human societies almost never seem to be able to collectively say ""hey, we don't need all this useless crap, let's simplify!""<p>The patent system, copyright, and indeed most if not all of the Federal Government and related structures like the Federal Reserve Bank (three things it actually isn't) as they are now,are all examples of wasteful, parasitic overheads with net negative benefit to American society. Which are major factors bringing society closer to systemic collapse. The energy crisis is rapidly lowering the 'available resources' ceiling, while all these parasitic, self-serving layers of social/legal complexity are inexorably raising the required resource expenditure. Maybe these lines on the graph have already crossed - there's some inertia and lag in this process, but it's still a mathematical reality that can't ultimately be avoided.<p>Personally, I consider the entire legal framework of corporate personhood, stock holding and the abstractions of social responsibility, finance and control that creates, to be another massive layer of harmful complexity. Creating 'inhuman' immortal entities which then grow to direct most of society's resources and control most of the media and government structures, seems like a very, very bad mistake. The present insane state of the patent and copyright systems is merely a side effect of that more fundamental error.<p>By now the entire corrupt, self-serving octopus of corporate/government parasitism is probably too entrenched to 'simplify' back to a sensible, workable level via methods available within the existing system.<p>Personally, I'd say the optimal level for such things would be 'gone entirely'. I'm aware most would not agree.\nI've also long felt that without a second American Revolution, there's no chance of making any progress in cutting back these existence-threatening layers of self-serving complexity. Lately it seems like I'm not so entirely alone in that view.",1353467301

Well, it's not for me to judge, right. But as someone who does in fact believe that people have an immortal soul, I would say that that whatever the universal spirit or cosmic order or divine intent that unites our existance is, it should probably not be taunted with statements like ""you cannot know the pain of someone who was the CEO of a tech company shutting down his office for the last time before hunting for a job in the hottest sector of the entire economy"", because that universal whatever might take the time to show you what it's like to be the 48-year-old employee of a midwest factory being shut down.<p>I had a neighbor who's kid --- a great kid, from what I can tell --- brought a pocketknife to school to show other kids. He was zero-tolerance expelled. My neighbor was doing OK for himself, but not OK to the extent of ""could swing private school"". From what I understand, that event killed it for them: they had to move, the mom and kids to one state (where the extended family lived and the school district would admit the boy) and the dad to a neighboring state to work and commute back on weekends. Do you know a lot of tech people that have had to do that? Then I'd like to suggest those people have standing to at least commiserate with the founder of a failed startup. And this is just something I saw personally; my inclination is, shit like this happens. Shit that is too boring to be the topic of a news story at the top of HN. Shit that happens to people who aren't lucky enough to be in the middle of the startup economy, and that happens approximately <i>all the time</i>.<p>Grand projects fail all the time. Open source projects die. Web communities die. Clubs wind down. Sporting teams disband. I write this so you can angrily tell me that I'm wrong: tell me what's so bad about a tech startup failing in 2012? (Let me preempt one obvious angry barb by saying that was a cofounder and investor in a VC-funded startup that failed in 2001, the ""nuclear winter"").<p>Please: I'm not saying that startup people are so lucky that they're not allowed to be unhappy when their companies fail. I am saying something else that is more subtle than that.",1353467127

541272,comment,540646,541011,0,0,brc,,,"In Australia, we have something called 'Superannuation' which is a bit like a 401k plan, except it's mandatory.  The employer must pay 9% of your total wages into the plan.  You can also contribute extra if you like, and some employers offer terms matching your contributions.<p>You are not allowed to draw down on your 'super' plan until you are at retirement age, and even then there are rules as to what you can take as a lump sum, and what is paid as an annuity.  After a certain point (I'm not an expert) you actually get your money out tax free.<p>You take this super plan with you from employer to employer as you move jobs, and you're free to transfer the money from one fund to the other.  You have to choose the fund yourself, and you can even create your own fund to invest in whatever you like (there are rules on size and reporting, and you can't leverage your fund with debt).<p>These rules enforce saving for the people who can't do it themselves, because they never see the money.  They are a little annoying to people who can quite capably invest for themselves, but there is enough incentives and flexibility to cater for the self-directed investor.  It was actually the unions who pushed for this system as they could see the folly of the employer-funded pension scheme.  Plus they formed their own 'funds' which their members use - the management fees probably brings in more income for the union than the union dues do.<p>In addition to super funds, Australia has a universal health care system which you pay with a 2.5% tax on your income.  This system covers everyone who is a citizen,whether they are working or not.  You may also opt for private healthcover, and there are tax incentives for people on higher incomes to do so (both for the employer and the employee).   With this system there are no co-payments or anything like that : just turn up at either the public or private hospital, and get treated.  Elective surgery (knee reconstructions, etc) goes onto a waiting list for public, private hospitals you get it done sooner.<p>The system has it's flaws, but for the most part it works, and you don't get companies with massive pension and healthcare liabilities.  It also means that employees are more confident to move between jobs knowing that their pension and healthcare are not tied to a particular employer.<p>Finally, and most relevant for this discussion, it allows startups to run much leaner because they don't have to worry about pension and healthcare for their employees.<p>And, to answer the question, on average, an Australian worker pays less tax (local, state, federal) on their income than the equivalent worker in the USA.  So it's not about paying less tax and choosing : it's about building a national system that has lower running costs but still allows for choice where the individual can afford it.",1238554587

With so many people scared for their future financial stability, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that more people are more likely to fall for a ""get rich quick"" scam. Sex-related spam might go down with respect to male targets also, but you can bet some spam will appear targeting women with ""get rich quick stripping online (doing phone sex), etc"".<p>Spam and most blackhat businesses are just that, business. The operators are your average greedy bastards, the great majority of whom are technically incapable twenty something men who think ""the internet"" is still in a dotcom boom. I'm not pulling this out of thin air, all you have to do is lurk in spam boards to see the prevailing mythology; a huge majority of 20-something spammers who want to live the Hip Hop lifestyle and who will do anything for money.<p>They themselves get scammed left and right by everyone from competent systems programmers who sell them backdoored tools to sophisticated mafiosi who open fly-by-night ""online banks"" to fake advertising networks that lure them into distributing their spam links and malware and then fold just when it's time to pay up, not to mention the ponzi schemes.<p>The life of a spammer is a bitch. If you were dealing drugs you at least have your tangible goods in hand and cash proceeds in the other. Spamming is like drug dealing, except someone keeps your stash and drop-ships it, and another keeps your cash and gives you a metered ATM card, nickle and diming you in every step of the way.<p>So the question becomes, what sort of spammer is making the real money (or the most of it) instead of asking if all spammers are making moolah. And the answer would be, the guys getting paid are not exactly in the spamming business :-)",1238553450

541244,comment,540540,541077,0,0,silencio,,,"Well, you don't necessarily have to pay. Just that your local BBB will be a lot less annoying if you do, and they'll also give you a shiny seal of approval and a better grade that doesn't mean squat.<p>I have no idea why so many people I know are so willing to jump to file complaints with them before some more logical ways to solve a problem...like, oh, calling up the business in question? BBB don't have any authority over businesses and their tactics are annoying on both ends. I've been burned by the BBB from both a business and a customer perspective by being ignored and told to go around in circles and do things I already attempted to do.<p>What was that issue I had as a customer? The alarm company I went with not providing service, which we discovered after routine monthly testing..can you say negligence? They wouldn't stop billing us and they even billed us for the equipment they gave us originally after we got a new company in to replace everything and told the old company to give us an address to at least send this back, or have someone pick it up (but they never did). The local BBB told us ""tough, deal with it, talk to them"" even though we filed an online complaint and the old alarm company kept hanging up on us before we could talk to anyone in charge of billing, at the least. So what happened? We sued the company and the owner and the situation ended happily for us, except if you go to the BBB and look up information on this business that still exists, there's nothing bad about it. Good job BBB, really, good job.<p>The business one was even more preposterous, where the BBB informed me that a customer had a complaint for something that wasn't even our problem, it was user error. She had never told anyone about it, she never called, she never visited again, she just went and filed a bullshit complaint that we went to unreasonable lengths to resolve to her satisfaction. What do we get for dealing with user stupidity? A lower grade on the BBB website? They're insane. You'd be hard pressed to find a business that doesn't hate them, especially smaller ones who don't want to pay extortionate rates for a stupid BBB ""approval"" when they already provide stellar customer support.",1238553129

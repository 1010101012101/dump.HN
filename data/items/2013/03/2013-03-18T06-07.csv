I agree with that.<p>I also agree that eating meat and claiming to be in favor of animal rights involves a certain amount of hypocrisy. I accept that, and I am still coming to terms with it personally (I have noted to friends, only half-jokingly, that I'm only about one PETA video away from becoming a vegetarian, and so I try to avoid them).<p>That being said, and given that there is a continuum of mistreatment, I still think it is acceptable to eat meat and attempt to encourage <i>more</i> humane treatment of the animals. The hypocrisy is still there, but surely less cruelty is an improvement even if the treatment is still cruel. Of course at some point you will reach a minimum viable level of cruelty, at which point people will have some uncomfortable choices to make, but that's a good thing in my mind.",1363589950

What I'm essentially saying is that the Reddit staff should pick a few thousand people by hand that they think embodies what they want the perfect redditor to be like. Everybody else starts out with minuscule influence. Now those ambassadors will go out and up-vote other good users and down-vote bad ones and will in that way spread their influence to other people. Some users might even have negative influence. Can you imagine a user who keeps up-voting cat pictures that is in effect down-voting those submissions without realizing it? It would be beautiful. Obviously it would be important to keep users' influence a secret.<p>In essence, it would give the Reddit staff much needed control of the content and discourse. If they one day wanted to steer the site towards only cat pictures, they can easily do that by selecting those users to be the ambassadors.<p>Right now it seems that Reddit is suffering from Eternal September x 1000, and they're at the mercy of the masses. But the geeky, thoughtful content that brought people to the site to begin with is nowhere to be found anymore. It's being drowned in memes and cat pictures.",1363589917

Shouldn't we be focusing on what <i>makes</i> us human as the philosophers would see it? Creativity, spontaneity, our thoughts and dreams - everything that goes on in our brains? Consciousness?<p>There will be more and more debate in the coming years as the concept of what is ""human"" will come under fire. Technological advancements, medical innovations and strong AI will throw our preconceptions under a train and force us as a species to reconsider, for better or for worse.<p>Do you see how the abortion debate stems from different understanding of the same concept?

I wanted to convert since 10 years prior to that, but couldn't get myself to do it because I grew up eating meat as a treat once to twice a week. It got progressively worse after I moved to the states as I started eating it three times a day and expanded from Chicken to all other red meats.I loved it!<p>Fast forward to last year and we were having a baby and that's when it struck me - Animals often watch their family being slaughtered. The young ones before they're even allowed to walk. They scream all along. They're mistreated extremely inhumanely and the people handling them - let's just say there's a special place in hell for them! I NEVER watched a single video until I had converted and people kept asking me if I saw any videos....they're horrible!<p>We grow up being masked from how animals are killed. If you can't even watch your meat being slaughtered, you shouldn't be eating it! Luckily, we're raising our child a vegetarian. We've found great vegetarian alternatives and yes they don't taste anywhere as great as a steak or smoked ribs, but they're still very very close and I think I can make that sacrifice because I don't ever want to see another animal deliberately hurt because of me or my family. I truly hope our society can make the necessary changes to treat animals humanely. Granted, there's no humane way to kill anyone, but I'm sure there's a quick/painless way to do it.<p>I'm not trying to change anyone. I just wanted to share my story.",1363588014

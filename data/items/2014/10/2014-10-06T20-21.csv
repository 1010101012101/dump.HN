It&#x27;s tasty, and bacon-flavored ice-cream is a great joke. But there&#x27;s also a vein of white-supremacy, anti-semitic, anti-muslim sentiment in America, and some of the people enthusiastically pushing to put pork in everything under the sun might be doing so because they know it&#x27;ll make others uncomfortable. A subtle way to assert that &quot;they don&#x27;t belong here, in the land of bacon&quot;, basically.<p>Is it a tiny minority? I certainly hope so. But I think there&#x27;s a larger overlap, of people who don&#x27;t think of themselves as actively racist, but who just go along with the bacon-everywhere mantra because they don&#x27;t mind rubbing it in.<p>Imagine if your favorite restaurant had a barbecue special every friday, and that coincidentally meant there were no catholics around the place. Okay, no big deal, just eat somewhere else. Now imagine if every restaurant in town adopted this schedule, leaving catholics feeling pretty unwelcome. A lot of us non-catholics would <i>never notice</i>, and probably just go along with it, hey, tasty food on fridays, right? Until someone mentioned it...<p>I think that&#x27;s where we might be on the bacon thing. Folks affected by it are a minority, and hesitant to say anything for fear of sounding whiny and further marginalizing themselves for their beliefs. And it&#x27;s tasty enough that most folks going along with it might not realize they&#x27;re playing into an agenda. And it would be impossible to prove that such an agenda even existed. Which I can&#x27;t prove.<p>But I do know that the bacon-fever makes some of my friends and coworkers feel just a little uncomfortable, a little unwelcome here. Food for thought.",1412628894

My SO and I both have Google Wallet accounts and one of the things we use often is the &quot;send money&quot; option.  She cuts a check for the mortgage payment every month and rather than set up a third joint account (such commitment!) or write two checks, I can just open Wallet and send her my share.  It&#x27;s not much different than setting up a bank transfer or using Paypal but the implementation makes it much more straightforward.  I&#x27;m basically sending her a message and &quot;attaching&quot; some money.<p>Same thing with going out somewhere and splitting a check with a few people.  If nobody has cash (which happens often enough), it&#x27;s easy for me to just pay the tab and then the rest just send me their share.  It shows up in a minute or two and there&#x27;s no fuss with splitting checks or deciding who owes who the next time we go out.<p>Probably one of those things where I&#x27;m trading some info about my interpersonal connections for convenience but frankly it&#x27;s much more streamlined than Paypal ever was and accomplishes the same thing.

They evaluated our software/company by focusing their efforts on extensively using our software in various (stress) test scenarios prior to discussing the deal. They also asked us to add a few features on short notice to test our ability to execute.<p>In fact, they kept the competing implementers (read: engineers who would actually write code) away from the deep technical decisions (and they had a competing effort which they merged with us later). Most of the technical discussions were limited to the engineering director who ran the group.

8418148,comment,8412948,8413831,1,0,Balgair,,,"Bingo. Word is out that college is a chance game for the &#x27;right&#x27; school and even when you get in, it&#x27;s rigged. You simply cannot compete with China, India, or Malaysia for spots at Stanford or UCLA. Those kids and parents can just plain out work you. My wife went to UCLA for grad school. Her students could speak English better than her, and would just out wait the professors for points on tests. Every single little thing was an argument and you&#x27;d just tire out and give it to them eventually. The cheating was a real concern as well, as the other cultures didn&#x27;t really have a sense of it being &#x27;wrong&#x27;, that it was just another arbitrary rule you had to jump through. You get caught? Then you didn&#x27;t cheat well enough. Also, all those kids are then either ending up back in Asia or in a cheap H1B visa spot you can&#x27;t afford a mortgage or kids on.<p>So, somewhat smart kids from Iowa will ask themselves: Why bother? I can&#x27;t compete to get in, I can&#x27;t compete when I am actually in there, and I can&#x27;t compete when I get out. Forget this game, I&#x27;m taking my tiddly-winks and going home.<p>And that is where the tier-2 schools really shine. Vassar, Colorado School of Mines, the Claremonts, etc really can take those kids that aren&#x27;t literally-cookie-cutter-perfect-snoflakes-drill-and-kill and make them really shine. Yeah, they won&#x27;t be the CEO of Hundai or GE, but they will make a damn good Lt. Major, or a VP at 7-11, or a hell of a McDonald&#x27;s franchise owner, or the best darn member of a school board that is always re-elected, or a real good child abuse prosecutor. You won&#x27;t make billions, but you will make 3-4 million.<p>There really is a need here for B- students that deserve a good living.

Milton Friedman aptly observed this gap between &quot;public affluence and private squalor&quot; as the defining outcome of centralized socialism. Christopher Hitchens, at that time a committed socialist, described his disillusionment w/Cuba while volunteering there in 1968 as follows:<p><i>Cuba was torn between grim austerity for its people and flamboyant hedonism for its revolutionaries, and one’s elementary socialist principles managed to register the gross injustice of this even while hoping (perhaps) that the engine of history would make up the deficit.</i>

It doesn&#x27;t recommend their hundreds (perhaps thousands) of political executions or their death squads or their forced labor camps. It doesn&#x27;t recommend their complete suppression of free speech and their prosecution of Cubans wanting to <i>leave</i> this self-proclaimed &quot;paradise&quot;.<p>And it seems quite unethical to praise Cuba for it&#x27;s export of medical expertise while ignoring the fact that relatives of these experts are essentially <i>held hostage</i> to ensure they won&#x27;t defect.

But, unlike Cubans (and former East Germans etc), we have the political infrastructure and basic human freedom to improve our system for the better.

The two main applications I&#x27;ve seen are VR &quot;movies&quot; that would record a scene with both video and depth information which would allow you to walk around in a recorded &quot;scene&quot; as it plays back.  The other is focused on using depth cameras to capture depth and video information and then compress and transmit it to create a more immersive form of telepresence.<p>I think that sort of thing is a much &quot;bigger&quot; application of VR technology than the gaming focus that it&#x27;s starting out with.  Gaming makes sense as a starting point since there are already engines and frameworks in place for generating 3d content that can be rendered from different angles to create the 3d illusion.<p>Still, I look at it like the early nickelodeons and parlor games seen at the advent of motion pictures.  I think it will be much more useful when you can place small, inexpensive depth cameras near the top of each wall of a room (for example) and use that to capture depth and video information.  That could be used to build a real-time 3d map of a room and people in the room and used in recorded or live communication.  I think it&#x27;s already at the point where this stuff can be done in a prototype form but as head-mounted displays and processing hardware is refined, it will be able to move from something requiring ski goggles and beefy workstations to streamlined specs and consumer-electronics base station appliances.",1412627303

It was instead directed at some unnamed developer who had set up kernel log handling in Debian with a &quot;dd bs=1 if=/proc/kmesg of=/var/run/klogd/kmsg&quot;, which was copying the kernel log one byte at a time to a FIFO (presumably because something reading the log was better able to deal with a FIFO than whatever strange semantics /proc/kmesg has).<p>Kay had then made /proc/kmesg semantics somewhat weirder, by not blocking but instead returning 0 when the available buffer wasn&#x27;t big enough to read into; normally, returning 0 to a read indicates that the file has been closed, while if there simply isn&#x27;t data available yet the call is supposed to block until it is.<p>So Linus was asking Kay to fix the issue, but also making an aside about how stupid it is to try to read one byte at a time from the kernel.<p>Now, there was the other incident you mention, in which Linus did get upset enough at Kay for not responding very well to a big report, but this one was not that; he was merely asking Kay to fix a bug, and cursing out some unnamed other developer for having done something as dumb as byte-at-a-time reads.<p>Not really defending either side here. I find Linus excessively caustic on these issues, and Kay a bit too unwilling to admit when he needs to fix a bug. I feel like Lennart gets way more hate than he deserves; he can be a bit difficult to work with sometimes, but it&#x27;s crazy how some people think that he&#x27;s single handedly out to destroy the Linux ecosystem.<p>I run a lot of software originally written by Lennart (Avahi, Pulse, systemd, heck, I recently even started using ifplugd on systems that still needed to use ifupdown but we wanted to respond properly to network cables being connected and disconnected), and find that it tends to be higher quality, more well designed, and more stable than a lot of the other code in the stack. Due to the fact that much of it changes the &quot;traditional&quot; way that systems worked to a very different but friendlier way, there tend to be a few integration issues along the way for early adopters; if you don&#x27;t want such integration issues, it&#x27;s probably best to use a stable distro like RHEL/CentOS or Debian Stable, rather than a quickly updating distro that ships code that&#x27;s not yet ready for primetime like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian testing/unstable.",1412626582

He just said it in a <i>very roundabout way</i>.  He wasn&#x27;t using &quot;laid off&quot; in its most obvious definition.<p>dehrmann said: &quot;<i>I was laid off...no reason...some management doesn&#x27;t like feedback...</i>&quot; which is his euphemism for saying &quot;fired&quot;.<p>(sidebar:  If one is a high profile employee such as an NFL coach or big shot CEO, he/she can simply and directly tell journalists, friends, etc that &quot;I was fired&quot;[2].  For some psychological reason, every one else from middle management down to line workers have a defensive mechanism to avoid the word &quot;fired&quot; and use softer language.)<p>TheOsiris[1] was of the few readers that picked up on the poster&#x27;s roundabout language.  Many others did not parse it correctly.  Unfortunately, the Reddit CEO  also didn&#x27;t interpret it correctly and so he thought he had to correct dehrmann by saying &quot;<i>you were FIRED for the following reasons</i>...&quot;  So, a misunderstanding by yishan for not recognizing his ex-employee&#x27;s strung out phrasing of &quot;yes I was fired&quot; unfortunately lead to the (unnecessary) boldface of &quot;fired&quot; in his response.<p>Anyways, we can set aside the &quot;laid off vs fired&quot; and recognize that the real disagreement is whether the ex-employee and the the company parted ways because of management retaliation about charity strategy, or because a lack of work productivity.<p>[1]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8417769"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8417769</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.siliconbeat.com/2008/06/10/fiorina-to-nyt-i-layed-foundation-of-hps-current-success/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siliconbeat.com/2008/06/10/fiorina-to-nyt-i-layed...</a>",1412626253

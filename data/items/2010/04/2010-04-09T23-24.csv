The fact that the agreement term can be interpreted to prevent umpteen different other cross-platform development environments is only relevant to the extent Apple's agenda includes enforcing the terms against the makers of those environments.<p>Now, assuming Apple is using this language to defeat the expectation that Flash is viable on the iPhone OS, who really loses?

1254135,story,,,20,15,NyxWulf,"Ask HN: What happened to rational discourse?",,"I'm curious why the reaction to the Apple Developer TOS change is making this community react so strongly.  One of the main reasons I left Reddit for Hacker News was the level of discourse was elevated and the polemics and hysterics in the stories were almost non-existent.  I don't disagree that the Apple dispute with Adobe is big news and calls for discussion.  What concerns me is the freewheeling hysteria that seems to be driving the topic.  As is almost always the case, I suspect this TOS change will either be modified, re-interpreted, or Apple will suffer community backlash.  As for my personal opinion, I would feel a far keener loss by losing the valuable insight and discussion that has so far been present in this community than I would feel over a change in the Apple developer TOS.",1270854361

Applications do not receive the event ""you are going to be killed, please serialize"" the same moment they lose focus; they receive it at the system's discretion. The system decides based on memory available (mostly), whether it will leave some processes running or whether they will be ""backgrounded"" (basically, what is more economical - backgrounding processes all the time, when the user is switching between two apps, or just keep them both in memory?).<p>To some extent, this is tunable by the power users - if they download ""Dev Tools"", they can set the limit to 1 - 4 processes (or unlimited). It is basically trade off between memory consumption and responsiveness.<p>I repeat - this is not supposed to be setting for common users; it is just exposed for developers to experiment, what happens when they push the decision threshold in one direction or another. The system is supposed to have good default out of the box and manage the processes automatically (which is also reason, why there is no task manager).",1270854316

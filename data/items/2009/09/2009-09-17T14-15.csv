Other than cost and keyword, you have to deal with the quality score that looks at the ad you write, the landing page the ad is pointing to

  Three groups of rats (test group, n = 7; stimulated 
  controls, n = 7; unimplanted controls, n = 12) were 
  trained to find food rewards ... . 

  During post-training rest and sleep, all of the online-
  detected ripples were suppressed by commissural 
  stimulations in test rats (average online detection rate 
  was 86.0 ± 1.3% (s.e.m.) of post hoc detected SPW-Rs;
  ...). Stimulated control rats underwent the same 
  protocol, except that a random delay (80–120 ms)
  was introduced between SPW-R detection and stimulation, 
  ensuring that the stimulations occurred mainly outside of 
  the ripple episodes.
</code></pre>
Now check this out:<p><pre><code>  Thus, these control rats received the same number of 
  stimulations as test rats, but their hippocampal
  ripples were left largely intact. The global architecture 
  of sleep and the local field potential power in distinct 
  sleep stages were not modified by the suppression of 
  SPW-Rs ... .  As stimulation outside SPW-Rs had
  no detectable effect on task performance ..., the two 
  control groups were pooled and compared with test rats. 
  Performance of the test rats was significantly impaired 
  ... .

Suppose we need better food supplies; food production companies need more capital to optimise their production. But, people want nicer trainers (aka sneakers) and so we allocate more money there for growth to recoup more profit from that id-ish desire for fashion. That's not efficiently running the system that's efficiently recouping the greatest profit. People's desire for better food needs to be improved but instead the profit from the shoe sales feeds-back and more money is spent on advertising and marketing and enticing people to want slick shoes in preference to healthy food.

That way you get your confirmation form and you do not store any data at all, it's either in the users browser (their risk) or underway to the IPSP, the only time it is on your server is the exact moment you pass it on.</i><p>This was actually the method we used during the initial build, just as a placeholder.

Most programmers do not realize what heights of engineering .NET|Mono, the JVM, Smalltalk, Symbolics Genera all are.  .NET's MSIL, in particular, is the most modular stack-based assembly language I know of... especially version 2.

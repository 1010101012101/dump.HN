Richard (rmtew) is also a central Stackless figure. Richard has pretty much said everything I would have to say, but I just wanted to chime in to make explicit that goless is a tribute to stackless (and go, and gevent, and everything before it), not trashing them.<p>It&#x27;s really quite a simple library, as all the hard work is done by gevent/stackless and most of the hard API decisions were copied from Go.

But I’m doubtful of how many managers will actually do it,” she said, because of the wide variation in how managers at different stores treat their employees.</i><p>Why?  Because it gets to the point that a company may, <i>on the whole</i> be trying to do the right thing, and may have progressive policies, etc., but - at the end of the day - it is individual middle managers who most directly impact the conditions that workers experience.<p>I doubt this point will resonate with the left&#x27;ish wing folks who consider all business owners evil, blab about &quot;capitalist oppressors&quot; and want a wholesale adoption of socialist (or psuedo-socialist) policies, but this is the truth.  Companies are <i>not</i> inherently evil, and companies can - and do - choose to try to do right by their employees... but enforcing consistent application of a policy related to working conditions is just as a difficult as enforcing consistent application of <i>any</i> policy in a large organization.<p>The question then, to me, is whether or not Starbucks can find a way to ensure that this policy <i>is</i> actually adhered to.

If you know these, you can solve a whole bunch of problems very easily; also, in reviewing those results, you inevitably remind yourself of <i>why they&#x27;re true</i> (I&#x27;m starting to make a re-derivation a criterion for listing a &quot;fact&quot; as memorized), and of the broader logical structure of the discipline.<p>2.

I would love to hear people&#x27;s arguments for it.<p>You could click the link -- the article here <i>is</i> a set of arguments for it. And there are usually more posted in every thread on the subject.<p>> Make no mistake, no one wants unemployment, poverty, starvation, poor health, etc.<p>Actually, plenty of people benefit fromt he existence of these things and the insecurity they cause in others, so I think the &quot;no one wants&quot; claim is false.<p>> People seem to treat basic income like a panacea<p>Never seen this. I&#x27;ve seen people directly address how basic income addresses particular problems experienced by government programs that exist to address some of the same problems now. I haven&#x27;t seen it treated like a panacea.<p>> Why don&#x27;t we give people money instead of food stamps? Is it because it was politically untenable? No, it was done because giving people food stamps (actually, now debit cards redeemable at grocery stores) is significantly more effective than just giving cash at solving hunger issues.<p>Evidence?<p>> I didn&#x27;t even get to the negative incentives it creates, which is a whole other can of worms.<p>Basic income eliminates negative incentives inherent in the means-tested programs it replaces.<p>> For example, subsidizing income on the lowest level generally leads directly to price inflation, which is highly regressive.<p>Basic income is an across the board increase to income, not a targetted increase at the lowest levels. Further, the regressive impact of price inflation is only an accurate description if you assume it occurs <i>independent</i> of income changes; to be regressive <i>with</i> income changes, the percentage increase in prices would have to be greater than the percentage increase in income at the lowest levels.",1408143886

That is, no politician would dare try to get rid of it due to the uproar from their &quot;entitled&quot; constituency.<p>I say that it is regressive because the bigger your mortgage the bigger your tax credit (given some small print about AMT etc), which means that people who qualify for larger loans (read richer people) get a better tax rate.<p>As far as it being harmful there are some disputed studies about US home ownership rates being much higher than the &quot;natural&quot; economic rate, which subsidizes all manner of non-essential middle men (real estate agents, lawyers, title companies etc) and increases the impact of mortgage rates on the larger economy.<p>My personal problem with it is that I&#x27;ve seen estimates that it costs the government close to half a trillion dollars.  This is a very similar number to Medicaid.  Medicaid is constantly being attacked yet the mortgage credit isn&#x27;t, when basic health care seems like a better fit for governmental spending to me than real estate industry subsidies.",1408143864

There are a few goods that last more than a few years without maintenance or replacement. Economic output puts a hard limit on how quickly you can turn your value store into stuff you actually want. For an individual it doesn&#x27;t make much difference, but when <i>everybody</i> tries to do it, it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>For an extreme thought experiment, consider if everyone puts half their income into a perfect store of value for a year, living off the other half, then the next year they live off the savings. Everyone would die of starvation the second year even though they supposedly have just as much value available as what sustained them the year before.",1408143725

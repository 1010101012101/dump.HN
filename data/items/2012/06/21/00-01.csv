[...] 10 years ago I realized that ... almost without exception, I can get the tech stuff done.<p>The examples of ""tech stuff"" you mentioned are very junior programming tasks. The ""programming"" the article talks about is all the non-PM/BA stuff: the overall technical design of the system, not just the file writing and database queries; the testing process from individual components to integration to customer involvement; the build and deployment processes, including impacts on existing systems and addressing security/privacy concerns, etc.<p>> I can get the tech stuff done. Of course, I'd like to do it myself, but I can get others smarter than me [...] to do the tech stuff.<p>Project managers and business analysts usually try to add technical skills to their resume by dabbling in some of the ""tech stuff"" of the projects they're managing. Usually this is the highest level stuff like architecture design or programming language selection or programmer analysis/selection: generally the stuff with the greatest impact on the success or failure of a project. You write ""Of course, I'd like to do it myself"" so I guess you're one of them. But those with PM/BA experience are the least able to do this project-critical tech stuff.<p>Project Managers get to dabble in this work because of their power in an organisation. They also try to keep their jobs by ""creating"" work and problems, just like middlemen everywhere. They stop technical people gaining too much power by splitting the systems into arbitrary projects. They give programming jobs to their mates in return for loyalty.<p>Despite their talk about being accountable for their results, in reality they cover their behinds in case they fail. When the tech stuff goes wrong, they leave behind a huge mess for programmers to clean up, usually with extra hours and overnight standbies. The business users get to do unit testing as part of their change acceptance process. The PM's go into recruitment and back into management somewhere else. A recruiter once told me ""if I had a job like that on my books, I'd apply for it myself"".",1340240283

These ""small, constrained devices"" we're talking about are probably 10x faster than a goddamned Reality Engine.<p>OpenGL ES 1.0 was released in early 2003, IIRC. The decision to exclude Immediate Mode from OpenGL ES 1.0 was made sometime prior to that.<p>2002-2003's typical mobile hardware was pretty damn weak, in particular in the areas of CPU cycles and memory bandwidth, which is where Immediate Mode really bites you in the ass. And the RAM/ROM sizes on most of these devices were small enough that every byte you could shave off the driver was a win for application writers, so there was little desire on the part of mobile graphic hardware vendors to spend memory budget on redundant features that an application could rebuild on top of lower level primitives if they so chose.",1340240008

Market forces don't have to be just or moral, they just have to be exactly that... market forces. There's no room for a ""morality"" variable in an economic formula, there's only concrete numbers that dictate price and demand.<p>In this case the market has decided that they will not use the current business model offered by the record labels. This same market has shown exactly what they want, and given birth to many new, profitable business models (Spotify, for instance). For the record companies to BLATANTLY IGNORE these market forces, and instead rely upon moral arguments to sway consumer thinking is becoming a more and more untenable position. It has very clearly not worked[1]. Thus, for the record labels to continue to offer this business model is very clearly not in their best economic interests.<p>Note that I am not passing judgement on either side. In my personal opinion pirating music without paying for it is clearly wrong. However my personal ethics have no effect on the fact that millions of people pirate millions of songs every day, and the fact that they will continue to do so until the current record companies (in their current form) will become extinct.<p>If the record labels truly want to win this battle they will provide consumers with a legal alternative that suits the market's demands[2]. That will not only erase the issue of morality, but will allow them to continue to profit. Now, obviously, companies have the right to choose whatever business model they want. That does not mean that the market has the OBLIGATION to support said business model. A better business model might, in fact, be ""NO UPFRONT FEES FOR SQL INJECTION VULNERABILITIES! Woohoo! In fact, no upfront anything!"". Doesn't mean it should be enacted, or that the market will decide to support it.<p>I'm simply trying to couch the debate in purely economic terms for the purpose of clarifying the exact problem and solution.<p>Now straying from the issue at hand, why are you bringing politics into this? What does you being a ""well-off liberal Democrat with good career prospects"" have to do with the current music industry? Furthermore, what gives you the idea that the ""other side"" (I'm assuming you're talking about Republicans) support ""Free music""? Even if that wasn't your intention, by introducing the political paradigm you open yourself up for that exact interpretation. But even beyond all of that, I would say that by bringing the us vs. them mentality (""the other side"") into the discussion you've already cheapened the debate from an intellectual discussion to a personal soapbox.<p>[1] To be frank, the average joe, and especially the average 21 and under individual doesn't give a rat's ass about the morality argument.<p>[2] This might include investigating several new methods of revenue if the market continues to demand free music (endorsements, lifestyle brands, etc. not necessarily concerts and merchandise sales).

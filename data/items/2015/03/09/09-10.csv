A hundred different fields of research have a hundred different notations which are usually assumed to be convention and the reader is expected to know about these. The i in the summation could also refer to the imaginary unit but only if you are talking to physicists/mathematicians. Engineers use a j instead. Or what about conventions such as Einstein summation or infix operators defined by a set of axioms? How do you even recognize what a variable is or that \oplus is likely an operator or that z^*z is not a typo but a superscript indicating complex conjugation followed by an implicit multiplication symbol?<p>In addition, much of the math out there is described in words, rather than pure formulae. Humans are capable to reason about these things because we are trained to have an abstract understanding of what these things mean in a given context (and we can actually understand text).<p>A naive implementation of checking correctness of equations would likely return an incomprehensibly long list of cases where your equation might not make sense. A program that could check each and every step of your computation needs to understand your notation and definitions.

I think Rust is the answer, but I would like to see more languages try to fill that gap--competition is healthy.<p>Programs written in C and C++ may have issues because the languages assume the programmer knows what they are doing. This assumption leads to some great solutions to hard problems because the programmer is essentially free to do what they want.<p>Of course, this assumption, as with most others, doesn&#x27;t always hold true. This doesn&#x27;t mean there is a problem with the language. The problem is with the programmer.<p>If you&#x27;re going to write something like &quot;return ({goto L; 0;}) && ({L: 5;});&quot;, no language is going to save you.<p>C and C++ are still used today, in part, because modern languages try to restrict the programmer. Rather than assume the programmer knows what they are doing, they assume the programmer is stupid and needs help to cross the road. By assuming stupidity, the restrictions modern languages put in place prohibit certain solutions and as such C and C++ will remain the go-to systems languages.<p>We do not need new languages.

This means you have one form for literally everything in the program and you will have no problem parsing that form. It makes reading, mentally parsing and editing easier because everything is neatly delimited by parentheses.<p>In terms of readability, do you have any particular difficulties parsing the following code?<p><pre><code>    (define (sum/recursive lst [sum 0])\n      (if (null? lst)\n          sum\n          (sum/recursive (rest lst)\n                         (+ sum (first lst)))))\n</code></pre>\nWe are defining a function, sum/recursive, that will take a list and return the sum of all the numbers in that list.<p>We use a default value of 0 for a function parameter called sum to store the sum. When the input list is empty (&#x27;(null? lst)&#x27; returns true) we return that variable. There is no return keyword, we just specify that variable and it will be returned.<p>If the list isn&#x27;t empty, we apply sum/recursive on the rest of the list and as a second parameter we add the first number in the list to the already accumulated sum (&#x27;(+ sum (first lst))&#x27;). Using matching parens in your editor will make it obvious when you have matched the right amount of parens.<p>It should be noted that Racket, this Lisp variant, uses &#x27;[]&#x27; as well to delimit certain parts, for readability.",1425891878

Nowhere else have I seen such blatant and hateful discrimination<p>I&#x27;m not white, and I&#x27;ve lived in the South for most of my life. From my experience, the South is less racist than either the West Coast or East Coast. Why? Because minorities are forced to hang out with people that aren&#x27;t their own ethnic group. When this happens the larger ethnic groups become familiar with your own ethnic group as well as some of the culture that comes with it. Conversely in the larger metros in both the East and West coasts, this seems to happen a lot less often because there are enough ethnic minorities here so that there&#x27;s a lot less mixing socially. Consequently, I&#x27;ve actually been the subject of inadvertent racism in the Bay Area at work. There wasn&#x27;t any malice behind it, just ignorance, but it was really unpleasant and that would be inconceivable in a Southern metro (from my experience).",1425891605

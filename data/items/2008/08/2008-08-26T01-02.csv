On one hand, you do have a valid point, but on the other hand...it depends on the person.<p>That friend that let me crash in his hotel room was then at most an acquaintance I knew from IRC. I mentioned my problem on an IRC channel and he offered to help out for the entire 9 days I was planning on staying. I did not go to him and ask if he had a place. After we met up in person, our friendship really developed. You could say it was just a smaller version of the HN community, as that now-friend was pretty much someone I've never <i>met</i> before, just another person I said hello to on IRC on a semi-regular basis.<p>Some people wouldn't take offense to the idea of sharing a couch like this. Others may. But it's only due to the generosity and openness of certain people that an idea like couchsurfing is even possible. And well, if anyone did maybe feel like letting this guy crash on their couch, they can get to know him better beforehand, and in person. The HN community isn't totally strange..yes, you don't know everyone personally, but people here most likely share some interests. I know that if someone here asked, we had lots of interests in common, and they didn't mind sharing a couch at my house and I didn't mind them staying over that I would most likely not mind them crashing for a day or two. Especially if they did some chores around the house or something small...doing the dishes after dinner, taking out the trash. :)",1219714741

I tend to prefer that my programs fail loudly, so I'd write string -> int conversion to raise an exception on seemingly non-numerical input like ""foo"", ""ba6r.5"", ""pwn3d"", etc. Then again, admittedly I know very little about web development.

I'm not sure I understand where the gain is.<p>I guess that, for me, the cost of a few keystrokes involved in writing ""if x == 0 then ..."" vs. ""if x then ..."" never seemed to be worth the hassle of remembering false values. I've always found it preferable to make the comparison being made explicit.<p>I also generally dislike the practice of using reserved values to signify empty data, e.g. 0 for missing numerical data. I prefer to use ML-style option types, e.g. None vs. Some 0, and in a dynamically typed language, I'd just use the nil/().",1219713681

(see the Nobel Prize winning <i>Ideological Origins of the American Revolution</i>)
But you can pick any major historical event and look at the basic message that kids are sent: the civil war was about freeing the slaves, WW2 was about saving the jews, vietnam was about stopping communism, Iraq was about deposing a mad dictator with WMD's.  Step back from any of these and look at the various motivations of all the players involved and you get a very complex picture that doesn't reduce easily to an ideological byline (America: spreading freedom!).  But every country teaches children that it is awesome, otherwise those children might grow up not believing in the legitimacy of the people in power.<p>In short, the actual function of school is to tell children that the current balance of power is the correct one, and comes up with all manner of reasons why this is so regardless of what the power structure actually is.",1219713492

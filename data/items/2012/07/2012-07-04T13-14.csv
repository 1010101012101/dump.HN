You cannot fix what's infinitely broken.<p>* PHP may have evolved to support many new methods and features that is expected from a modern language, but mixing and mashing ideas and implementations from other languages in a semingly random fashion doesn't make a language good; only messy. It still and always will lack a proper philosophical design.<p>* PHP's ecosystem is far from healthy. It's flooded with outdated and/or badly written code, so it really doesn't matter if dependency management is good. Wordpress is proof of this, just look at the source.<p>* PHP is neither easy to learn or code (correctly). It's just so forgivable that you can do more or less everything wrong and still have a working application. Fabien, you should know this.<p>* PHP is a resource hog compared to the competition; even with the tiniest stack. I.e. running Node.js will use less then a third of the resources compared to a LAMP stack.<p>There will never be a ""best language"" to rule them all. Every situation have different needs.

So that means nothing about PHP. It means that people don't see a lot of benefit in publicly advertising failure and then flagellating themselves for their own choice of tools. People don't do that, they just quietly switch.<p>People do hear about the problems with PHP, when they are mentioned. It's good to have specifics available rather than just delivering some general subjective statement, which is why we get one article after another highlighting various screwups in the project itself.<p>You can use any Turing complete language to write programs. That sets an upper bound on how difficult it can be to do virtually anything.  But this is hardly a defense of PHP.

You are transferring your thought processes into computer code. A computer program is, quite logically, an encapsulated and packaged thought process.<p>I don't think anyone can or should try to argue that everyone thinks the same. Hence, not everyone's code is the same. And it follows that some people's thought processes are more efficient or better structured than others. These are the 50x'ers and 100x'ers. The A players. And I feel that just understanding that what you are doing is packaging your thought processes helps immensely in becoming more efficient, just because of the way you approach the problem.<p>People who are the 50x'ers, or 100x'ers, just solve problems very efficiently and are very good at packaging that problem solving logic in code. They are probably not as good as the 1x'ers in other areas of life--perhaps they are not as good at loving people, or raising children, or writing, whatever. They can be (and in my experience often are) not as good at a million other areas of life, many of which are far more important than programming. But they are very good at problem solving and transferring that problem solving logic into computer code.<p>I agree with Steve.",1341407901

Yes, you might have to rewrite some constructors.  And some frameworks have different features, but can still be carried over if you need it.  You aren't beholden to a single code base.<p>For example, I can easily move my models from Zend to Symfony without rewriting a thing.  Decoupling is a wonderful thing.<p>So, you have this code base you are using, these libraries that are already written, and tested, and working.  Moving to Ruby/Python would require that they all be rewritten, and appropriate libraries be replaces.<p>Moving to another language isn't a weekend endeavor when you have a workflow and toolset built up over a 10+ years of development in another language that, in that domain, accomplishes the same thing.",1341407793

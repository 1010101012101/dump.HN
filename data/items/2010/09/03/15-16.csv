Or he left it behind as ""kid stuff"" when he became an expert. One card per day per film lot ought to be enough to make consistent, repeatable prints.<p>The grey card is also the key to getting professional negative printing done as well. (And there were several entire industries dependent on professional labs. Portraiture, weddings and forensic photography were almost always done on negs, usually Kodak Vericolor 160 shot at 100 or 125, later split between Portra 160 and Fujicolor Reala; the prints from transparencies were too garish for skin tones.) Think of it as ""white balance"" for film. One standard 18%-grey exposure with push/pull instructions would do for both souping the negs and printing. Get the grey right, and all of the qualities of the light, including filtration, come in the package (modulo reciprocity failure if you print murals from small or medium format).<p>[Okay, I'll admit it -- as a photographer, I was an immaculate technician but no sort of an artist. It still bugs me that guys like this guy and David Brooks can make a living at the game without knowing any of the voodoo behind what they do.

That seems like a recipe for more complexity, not less.  What happens when the DST rules change?

How does a company rise above the noise to attract massive discovery and adoption? YouTube did it through existing channels like MySpace, which already reached millions. Yelp had strong SEO, which found them a mass audience searching for restaurants and nightlife. Facebook’s University-centric approach landed them 80% adoption across a campus within 60 days of launch. Every Net entrepreneur should answer these questions: How do we get to one million users?

PR, for example, is completely saturated; go to a couple networking events and you'll bump into countless forty- and fifty-something PR people who desperately need a job. They're no longer gatekeepers; they're a commodity.<p>The other channels listed are similarly commoditized. You can put an extra unit of time or money into them, but it's hard to get more than 100 cents on the dollar from your investment.<p>The best way to think about distribution is to think about how you can create a sustainable competitive advantage. Group buying, for example, means that there's a positive dollar value on persuading friends to participate. Social gaming lets Zynga recruit your social network to prod you into reengaging with games.<p>Better to come up with something like that--something that will make your competitors feel a little queasy about the thought of trying to peel off your customers.",1283527401

The problem is that they need to sell washing machines when they're sitting in a row of competitive products. In their experience, people in the market for a washer tend to buy on features.

1659796,comment,1658380,1659707,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> As for your self-replicating pixel-drawing program that can evolve to a web browser -- you are more than welcome to have a go at it. I can tell you from now that it will fail. There's a simpler experiment, that will also fail: <a href=""http://www.randommutation.com/darwinianevolution.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randommutation.com/darwinianevolution.htm</a><p>That's a flawed example for several reasons. The main one is that the selection is based on a target (the new word) or is considered over too short a timespan. Even worse is that you are getting random variation in every generation, which is actually against the principle of evolution. In your cited example the whole chain would die out very quickly - favouring chains that mutated more slowly.<p>My example is better because the end product is irrelevant; the code becomes a program. Programs that are ""better"" in some ambiguous way will be used more frequently. Over time the most useful programs will evolve; but only over millions of generations. The end product is uncertain; but according to Darwinian theory it would fit the environment (so, if we had no internet there would be no network scanner to evolve).<p>> Yet another instance of hand waving. You might think it is possible, but until you prove it, I will claim that this is an unscientific claim.<p>I'm sorry but what is unprovable about mutation; this is one of the aspects we have observed! Both at a cellular and DNA level.<p>> The part that is often overlooked, even though it is so crucial, is the lack of evidence for whether mutations have the ability to actually produce any useful set of variations for NS to act on.<p>Most of your argument seems based on the idea that a mutation can produce a change/feature - but that it cannot be shown empirically that good changes/features have or can occur. This does not seem logical at all; you are basically arguing that it is impossible to a random mutation to have a positive effect on the offspring. This is incorrect; the mutation inarguably, as you agree, can produce a change - so at some point a positive change must occur (even if it is entirely unlikely).<p>As I am sure you appreciate; subtle improvements take a long time to take effect. That we exist in this form <i>is</i> highly improbable - but that is not dis-proof of the theory.<p>Please bear in mind I am just trying to be helpful here - not making any criticism of how informed you are. However you do not appear to be schooled in Darwinian theory because:<p>> Darwin focused on NS so much, but that's because he assumed that NS is the force that drives the variations.<p>Is 100% counter to what Evolution says.<p>> If you really think about it, he's making an analogy with market competition<p>He's not. In the slightest. He is making an empirical observation that animal survival is related to competing with others. NS is the process by which organisms with inheritable mutations that favour them survive longer and slowly mix their genes into the species.<p>The process of stacking mutations in sequence to achieve what we are today is complex and highly unlikely; but not impossible. That is the point Evolution makes. I don't see a counter explanation with such solid theory, that is all.",1283526370

1659778,comment,1658380,1659516,0,0,avar,,,"1) That's not correct. natural selection doesn't have a narrow/expand bias one way or the other. Lineages simply survive if they manage to produce offspring.<p>Sometimes that's because they evolved some novel new thing (like birds learning to fly). Sometimes it's because they <i>didn't</i> do that, e.g. in the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event the boring mammals that were small and had a tendency to burrow to escape trouble survived.<p>A variation that happens through a mutation <i>doesn't</i> need to be present in both breeding partners for it to survive. This is obvious if you look at common dominant[1] and non-dominant genes, like the tendency towards a certain haircolor. That trait might be passed on to the offspring, and would permeate if it was advantageous enough.<p>A lot of variation also doesn't happen through mutation at all, but simply selection within a species. E.g. this happened to humanity [3] relatively recently. We lost a lot of biodiversity within Homo Sapiens simply because a lot of us died out.<p>Most of the biomass on this planet never ""expanded"" in any significant sense. Multicellular life is still relatively rare, most of the biomass on earth is bacteria.<p>2) The notion that each species has an ecological niche is false. We live on a large planet, so there's a big opportunity for species that ""do the same thing"" (to simplify). Of course that's only true up to a point, consider the example of the Eastern Gray Squirrel displacing the Red Squirrel in the UK.<p>3) There's a lot of things that species <i>could</i> do but aren't doing. Not because that thing would be a ""bad idea"" as such, but simply because it hasn't evolved yet.<p>E.g. insects could probably take up a lot more space than they do now if they grew larger, but that would require evolving a whole new breathing apparatus. Maybe monkeys would be better suited to trees if they had four hands, but two is all they (and the whole vertebrate line) had to work with.<p>4) I don't get this. Why do you think species should be much more inter-breed-able. They are to an extent, but once speciation occurs they aren't anymore.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)</a><p>2. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Gray_Squirrel#Displacement_of_red_squirrels"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Gray_Squirrel#Displacem...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve</a>",1283526019

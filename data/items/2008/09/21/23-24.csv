I thought the only thing that mattered was preaching to the choir & getting them to vote at all.<p>Not at all.  While you don't have a chance if your base doesn't come out, they almost always do.  As a result, swing votes typically decide US elections.<p>There are, however, two kinds of swing votes.  One always votes, but switches.  The other shows up occasionally.",1222041238

Just guessing, I'm thinking a white-collar crime that involved no use of violence? 6 months to 2 years maybe?<p>Now is there an additional crime for political espionage in the course of trying to throw an election? I believe so, or at least that there should be. I think if you commit a felony in the process of trying to sway political opinion that should pump up the punishment some. As an example I use the Watergate burglars, who were anything but run-of-the-mill crooks (and got punished more than first time burglars as well, if I remember correctly)<p>Crime with deliberate political implications, whether violent or not, should be treated more harshly. Perhaps this kid didn't break into Palin's account to sway public opinion. I don't know enough about the case to determine that.",1222040996

I didn't intend ""you"" personally, but the ""It's just that there is a growing anti-American sentiment in the rest of the world"" (as I quoted).<p>> Your kind of insular attitude proves exactly what I'm saying.<p>Huh?  You said that there was a growing anti-American sentiment.  While I agree, how does what I said prove that?<p>Or, are you saying that I proved something that you didn't state explicitly?  If so, what?<p>> For the record: I thought the Americans and the Aussies were allies?<p>So?<p>Your strongest argument would be that Australians are probably Americans' most popular ""not Americans"".  (Canadians have gone with a curious mix of invisibility and defining themselves as ""not American"".)  And, you seem to take care of them yourselves.<p>However, that doesn't change the fact that much of what the US sees overseas is folks with their hands out.  We also see folks screaming about the US ""doing it wrong"" when they're not doing it at all.  Maybe we're incorrect, but I'm talking sentiment, as you did.<p>There is no shortage of problems in the world.  Surely some of them can be taken care of by someone else.  Rwanda was well within the capabilities of many other countries.  Somalia is as well.",1222040741

Business is amroal for the simple reason that corporations are not people.<p>However, there is such a thing as disgusting when people make business decisions. The fact that someone owns a business or works for a business does not relive them of personal moral responsibility.<p>A business is perfectly correct to decide that offshoring shoe manufacturing to copuntries with child labour is the right choice. A business is perfectly correct to decide that offshoring chemical manufacturing to countries with lax safety standards is the right choice.<p>The people working for those businesses, on the other hand, are not off the hook. They cannot invoke the Nuremburg defence, for can they assert that since the business is devoid of responsibility, and they work for the business, their decisions while on the job are devoid of responsibility.<p>Thus, speaking to another post here, I have no <i>ethical</i> problem with a firm that exists to commit patent extortion.

In the US, political preference is typically passed down along family lines.  While there are exceptions, this is especially true of politican's families.  Above the state level, it's fairly common for one or more kids to go into the family biz.  (The Kennedys are merely the best known example.)",1222039125

The loss has already happened. The loss isn’t what happens on a balance sheet: the loss is what happens when someone cuts down a tree, makes cement, builds a 6,000-square-foot house in a place it should never be built. So the loss has already happened. The question is: How do you allocate that loss? And if you don’t allocate the loss, if you pretend it isn’t there, then this has really baleful consequences for the economy.</i><p>I would invest my money with this guy.  most people in the financial sector don't seem to realize the real life consequences and causes of the markets they manage.",1222039047

I think it's a little irresponsible to have a headline that shouts ""Palin Hacker Caught"" when he hasn't admitted to it, been convicted of it, or even been charged yet.

Overall the incident is a net win for the Republicans (it could easily have been a net loss if anything really incriminating had been found) but it's a small story in the scheme of things, and it'll drift into the background noise as soon as next week's minor (or perhaps major) political scandal happens.<p>2) If google trends were a good indicator for elections, then our president would be ""britney spears naked pictures"" with ""generic viagra"" as her VP.<p>3) It's possible you might have heard some of the many false rumours about some of Sarah Palin's positions -- doing a bit of research might put your mind at ease on some of those.<p>In particular, she never supported putting anything other than evolution on the school curriculum, and she never  tried to ban any books either.

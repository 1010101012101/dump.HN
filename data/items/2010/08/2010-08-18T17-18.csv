I'd love to lop off 400 sq ft and get that percentage of my money back, but I just can't. That is what exists in the market today where I'm living. The end result is more money out of my paycheck than I'd like and an empty bedroom in my house. (Luckily we can afford the place off one income at least)<p>There are a lot of reasons why this happens, but the biggest one is that the cost difference to the builder of making a small house compare to a big one is a lot less than the price difference they get for building them. The same goes for boats, and today you can hardly buy a small boat anymore, they've all figured out the fatter margins are on the bigger ones.<p>A similar question applies to her numbers for income. Income averages have increased, but that is a result of increasing income disparity more than an average increase. So what is the change for someone in the 1st percentile? The 25th? The 75th? the 100th? It is an impossibility for those numbers to be the same because the income disparity has increased so somebody is white washing the data here.",1282154083

1614951,comment,1614800,1614800,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"This is all well and good unless the distribution of domain name ownership is that 1% of domain owners own 99% of registered names. If you want a domain that happens to be owned by a small owner, I'll agree you could face much bigger problems. If, however, there were only small domain owners (and if my ratio above applies), then 99% of the time, you wouldn't face any problems at all because 99% of the time, the domain simply wouldn't be registered yet.<p>Despite being wrong about the problem, the author's solution is not bad. For a serious commercial endeavor, $100/year is insignificant. For a personal site, it's a fortune. The author's solution does seem to solve this problem.<p>There are still problems though.<p>1. The .com TLD is so prolific that using a different TLD is a problem even for personal sites. The author's solution would've been great if it was implemented from the start. Right now, it might be good at best. Even if you just show your site to a few of your friends, some of them are likely to get the TLD confused if it's not .com. If this was implemented from the start, though, that wouldn't be a problem because everyone would know that personal sites don't use .com.<p>2. Domain squatters, the real problem, will still exist. They'll just be more selective. If someone can get beer.com, they'll still do it if it's $100/year. That's still likely to be a good investment. If you raise the price enough to make that a bad investment, you've probably priced out a lot of serious commercial sites that just don't have the money for an expensive domain name.<p>Perhaps a better solution from the beginning would have been to have a bunch of cheap TLDs that anyone could use for anything at $1/year, and then .com which would have varying prices depending on the value of the domain. True, you can't predict with certainty what will be valuable, but you can predict with reasonable certainty that any word in the top 1000 English words is likely to be valuable. You can similarly predict that shorter names are likely to be more valuable than longer ones.<p>Of course, we don't have the option of changing what was done, so that's probably all moot.",1282154050

Lecturing people is not an effective way to change their behavior. And in many cases, people make environmentally poor decisions because they don't have much choice. Many many jobs in the US effectively require that you have a car. Many affordable residences also effectively require that you own a car and drive a lot. People need jobs and they need shelter, and for many people their existing jobs and homes lock them into having one car per adult in the home.<p>In other policy areas, we've decided that an issue is important enough and should be taken out of the realm of personal virtue and placed into the realm of social action. My brother is disabled. He doesn't have to go around begging for coins so that he can eat this month. There's no opportunity for you to demonstrate your personal virtue by donating cash to him. Instead, we've all decided that seriously disabled people shouldn't have to go around begging to survive, so everyone is going to have a chunk of cash taken from their paycheck used to cover Social Security Disability Insurance. We lose a bit of cash, but in exchange we get to live in a society where severely disabled people don't die on the street because they can't work. We've taken a policy problem out of the realm of personal virtue.<p>We should do the same thing with climate change. Greenhouse gases are bad. So put a tax on them and let the market find a way to reduce them. Then we won't have to harass random people who make lifestyle choices we don't like; instead, people will make choices that in aggregate are more effective at mitigating climate change. In the story above, the truck driving apartment dweller would have more cash to spend than the car driving McMansion dweller, which will be far more effective in getting the McMansion dweller to change her behavior than any amount of lecturing, no matter how technically correct it is.<p>Trading sanctimony and self-righteousness for policy effectiveness seems like a huge win to me.",1282153844

The job required me to move out on my own. My girlfriend (of 5 years) and I decided to do it together so she moved as well and she's looking for a job. We pay all of our own bills.<p>I have an older brother (26) who also has a technical degree and is full time employed, but both he and his girlfriend still live at home and are ""planning"" on moving out soon.<p>Financially they are in a much better position. They make roughly comparable salaries as we do, but their expenses are basically only for health care, their cars, their cell phones, and any discretionary spending. The parents pay for a roof, food, utilities etc. They can save up their cash and are trying to move directly from living at home to buying their own place so they skip the renting waste of money (please don't get into that firestorm here, I've heard all the arguments, suffice to say they're saving money by not renting right now).<p>In contrast, I'm paying absolutely everything. We have roughly $1800 a month in rent and bills that they don't have. It sure isn't as expensive as living in NYC but thats 22 grand a year that we're not putting in the bank that we would have if we could have found a job near home and lived with our parents.<p>So financially, moving home after college makes a lot of sense. Especially if you have loans. If I were living at home I'd be putting that 22 grand a year into starting my own company instead of paying a landlord and some utility companies.<p>On the other hand, we're getting an experience they're not. I go home and my brother is considering buying some fancy ass car, meanwhile my girlfriend and I are juggling bills and debt to make ends meet (that first month when you have to pay all your bills but haven't actually gotten a full months of pay SUCKS). It is nerve racking and I feel like we're ""maturing"" because of it.<p>In the end will it pay off for us? I doubt it will financially but it might in other ways. But if you look at our friends, maybe 5 or 6 out of 20 that just graduated moved out and the rest went home. It is by far the norm to move home after college now.<p>(Also your quote about the 20 year olds driving nuclear bombers struck me. I showed up for work (engineer at a military contracter) and suddenly I'm surrounded by a bunch of teenagers in uniform running all of the multi-million dollar weapon systems we make and I got a ""they're just kids!"" emotion that makes me feel really damn old. )",1282153233

Throw any of those sites on a commodity host like (mt) or even GoDaddy, with the same plugin, and your users will have a nearly identical experience.<p>I don't doubt that they're offering a good service, but you can achieve this on your own with the a cache plugin and a reliable hosting service. In todays modern VPS world, $49 and $99 (WP Engine pricepoints) will get you a pretty beefy VPS.<p>This post is indeed a bit vague on the details, and does feel like a post piece. A disclaimer should have been at the bottom :P<p>Also, I am curious to know if they're using mod_php with Apache, or FastCGI. The latter of which is more secure. At that point, however, I wonder why they just wouldn't use Nginx + FastCGI for everything and eliminate Apache altogether.<p>At the opposite side of the spectrum, it does look like they have a few other nice features like being able to snapshot your site and modify things in a staging area, separate from visitors.

An alternative hypothesis could be that a lot of the putatively better stuff that people have are produced significantly more cheaply today than in the past. Clothing and furniture, for example. The savings on these items would allow people to have other things (e.g. personal electronics) in quantities that didn't exist a generation ago.",1282151268

Now everything starts and we will try hard to find all the most important news about Android each week.

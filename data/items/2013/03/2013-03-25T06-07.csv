They make some miserable choices, and a some of their apps are complete crap (Their podcast app should have never, ever been released.)  I've never been happy with any of their cloud applications, mobile me was crud, their web photo sharing system is still next to useless, and photostream is barely useable - you'd think after a couple years they would have been able to figure out how DropBox syncs so reliably.  Battery Management is horrible - I can't tell what's heating up my iPhone and sucking down my battery.  Background applications STILL can't download files, even when you have 100% battery, are plugged in, and are on WiFi (Seriously - when is Apple ever going to figure that one out - When will my NYT app be able to download a newspaper, OmniFocus Sync my Tasks, Downcast download my Podcasts, etc..).<p>I could go on and on about the things I don't like about Apple, and Apple products - but, the one thing they nailed is 100% App Separation on the iPhone.  Malware is already starting to make it's way onto the iPhone, and the more they can do to lock down that platform, the happier I'll be.<p>Does this mean that I don't have the flexibility with my Phone that I have with my Laptop? Yes.  But does it mean my phone is about 10x more consistently reliable than my Laptop - Also yes.<p>But, with all that said - could Apple come up with a mechanism to allow some kind of Inter-App sharing, wherein you could explicitly (I.E. User Initiated, not App Initiated) send data from one application to another - Almost certainly.  John Siracusa has been on them to do this for at least a couple years now - and if they'd simply use one of his (very well informed) rants as their PRD, the IOS platform would certainly evolve.  But I'm hoping they do it in a way (Copy / Paste?, Sharing Icon?) that guarantees the same level of separation, reliability, and simplicity that we currently enjoy.<p>Until then - Media viewing/consumption apps like GoodReader usually offer a pretty broad variety of input options, including just reading from your Dropbox folder (among many, many choices)",1364194336

The issue I have with this tweet is that it implies one would not take ugly people, regardless of gender, to prom and comes off as shallow.

That's how you outflank DropBox.<p>I'm not sure if many here use iCloud search today (for mail), but it is abysmally slow and unreliable.

Dump an app. Don't worry  nothing you do in any other app will be affected.<p>To put it another way: apps need to communicate large blobs of information (i.e., documents). You'd say, from first principles, that they need a <i>nonvolatile Inter-Process Communication mechanism</i>.<p>In most OSes, apps pass documents between them with the moral equivalent of ""shared memory"" IPC: files that both apps have read/write access to.<p>In iOS, on the other hand, apps use the moral equivalent of message-passing-with-copy.<p>Thus, apps get all the same benefits from this that, say, Erlang processes get from in-memory message-passing-with-copy IPC. The primary one being that when the process/app is removed from the system, all its resources can be released, without having to disentangle them from any other process/app that might be depending on them.

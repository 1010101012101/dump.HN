I started from scratch.<p>Different groups of people have different use cases, and different needs. It's a fallacy to think you can design one thing for all people. It compromises your vision.<p>Make sense?<p>And yes, by the way, there are lots of things we are able to do with Freckle because we have decided paths that we do <i>not</i> want to tread. For example, project creation is always on-the-fly. It's so elegant I could cry.<p>But if we added permission restrictions, based on who could create projects, that would take away the elegance, and add confusion.<p>In the end, our approach -- which is awesome for our desired audience -- would be totally compromised by the additional error-checking and rigamarole if we were to add this as a feature.<p>Thus, we won't do it. There are plenty of people who <i>don't</i> need or want that, who are our potential audience. And people who do need it, won't like the other assumptions our app makes. They will be better served by more traditional products.<p>To my mind, this is win/win/win.",1255005967

I don't think this is a controversial stance, no?<p>- I don't think it is fair to expect your 1st employee to put in 15-20 hour days consistently. Even if the 1st employee did put in such effort, as Rethink guys point out, they would be putting in almost the same effort as them and thus calling him/her an ""employee"" would be wrong.<p>- A big objection you seem to have relates to how long the company has existed. You think that 3 months is a long time for a cofounder to come in. If you look at the longterm roadmap of a startup, the initial 3 months hardly register. Do you think 10 years from now the new cofounder will look back and feel inferior to the other founders?

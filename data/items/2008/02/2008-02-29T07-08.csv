I believe a lot of doing a startup well is daring to put yourself out there to be judged. This is right in line with that idea (to an extreme). Brave and commendable.",1204271639
125964,comment,125766,125800,0,0,cstejerean,,,"I've found Practical Common Lisp to be the best book to get me started with CL. It covers the fundamentals nicely but it does everything in the context of real applications so you walk away from the book having actually built something useful.<p>As far as problems to start working on, the best way I've found to learn a language is to start making tools/utilities for myself. Then I'd start learning everything I need to implement that particular tool. Pick a task that you wish was simpler or more automated and write a tool to do that for you.",1204271387
125963,comment,125317,125615,0,0,zasz,,,"I go there. I have a good hacker friend who's been approached by other students or ex-students several times to form some sort of startup or to do other little programming projects. So far, they have all been miserable failures. No, not even failures, because they never even really tried. So what if people here are smart? I don't think they are nearly as motivated as most YC.ers think they are--god, just go to any meeting of a student group after the first couple weeks of the quarter, it's a shitload of, ""Yeah I would've liked to go but I had a paper and a problem set due..."" Same thing with the little projects that just fizzled. Of the wannabe entrepeneurs I've met here, nobody has shown the kind of commitment pg seems to think is necessary. I met them. They're still in school, still trying to balance a startup with getting their degree, still unable to commit themselves and take the plunge.<p>I think the vast majority of Stanford students, or other elite students anywhere, are admitted because they put their schoolwork first. Sinking lots of time into any extracurricular, including entrepeneurship, is a sacrifice a lot of students aren't used to making and would have trained themselves to not make in high school, and in fact, such a sacrifice could have royally screwed them out of getting in in the first place, and almost certainly would have if they had gone to a very competitive high school.<p>Seriously, FUCK STANFORD and don't worry about it. Just find a good school that's not too much pressure to get into.",1204271185

But I absolutely love regular old C. It's a beautiful, simple programming language. I think C is a perfect language for implementing programming languages, libraries and operating system.",1204270872

125959,comment,125623,125861,0,0,derefr,,,"Obvious fix: procedurally generated plotlines to match the procedurally generated terrain. Bit hard (generate races with mutations and factions and famous individuals of those factions and historical events involving those individuals and factions, then breed some family lines and run the economics to force feudalism, industrialism, capitalism and so on to spread across the world as it's explored and make some stereotypes of how each part of the world sees each other part, then create some famous bits of media using a combination of the Hero's Journey framework or some soap opera cliches and said stereotypes &c &c &ccc) but only on the level that, say, Spore is hard. Once it's done it could probably be used with just minor tweaks in thousands of games, though; perhaps even changing the writing profession to be a sort of make-up artist for such story skeletons.",1204270645

If you have a good IDE a lot of the fluff is taken care of for you (try writing Lisp in Notepad, it isn't much fun either).<p>I see Java as a good C++ replacement.

125954,comment,125857,125857,0,0,ken,,,"Krugle gets an automatic win in my book because it seems to be the only one that can search Common Lisp code.<p>On Google and Koders, setting lang=Lisp turns up mostly Emacs Lisp, and ""lang:cl"" gives only Tcl code.  (They distinguish between CL and Scheme, but not Elisp!)  O'Reilly has no language selector, but searching for a Lisp symbol just turns up a lot of Emacs Lisp books.  And Ucodit can't seem to find any Lisp code at all.",1204270045

have you considered personalising as a method of minimising trolling?<p>As you pointed out, people do things on forums that they wouldn't do in person.  IMO, this is partly because they're hiding behind a handle and partly because their target is.<p>I'm not sure how you'd go about making accounts have more personality and identity, but IMO that would be considerably more effective than just instructing people to behave like they're face-to-face.  They know they're not.",1204270032

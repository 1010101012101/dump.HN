Northern Europe started from behind, but caught up and eventually surpassed the South, at least from a North American vantage point.<p><i>Further, the British were every bit as interested in raping the Americas for gold as the Spaniards and Italians ...</i><p>Sure. There's a tendency (especially in the U.S.) to simplify and say that the Northern Europeans wanted ""to settle and live in religious harmony"" (hogwash) and that the Southern European explorers wanted to loot. It's a <i>lot</i> more complicated than that, as you know. Assessing virtue to one side or the other is ridiculous.<p>It's impossible to know for sure, but I think that religious leaders on both sides of the divide (not that ""Protestants"" were a united group) wanted to validate themselves. The Catholic Church, fearing a loss of power in Europe, sent people overseas to expand and validate Catholicism. This might have made people behave better on a social or economic justice front (religious charity). It might have made them worse (aggressive conquest and cultural genocide). It's hard to tell. From a modern vantage point, it was all very ugly, but most of history is that way.<p>I tend to think, however, that the Reformation started (or, at least, accelerated) conversations about comparative society, religion, and government.",1363272727

I've found following a huge method or function rather complicated, but at the same time I think I find trying to track down complicated abstractions even more complicated. If you've ever stared at a new codebase trying to track down a bug, you know the joy of grepping and following chains of methods trying to get to the part that actually matters. This may not make it technically less readable but I'd say it makes it significantly less, uh, understandable?<p>Really, it boils down to how easy the code is to understand and maintain.

The reason I did it this way is that I wanted a conventional abstraction (MVC) without the burden of a new API.<p>The only real ""magic"" here is how Sails handles Socket.io requests using the same controllers.  Sails generates req/res objects for socket requests and allows you to handle WebSocket requests in the same code base as the rest of your app.  If you need to do more custom stuff, you can still directly access Socket.io through sails.io, and each request object that came from a socket request contains req.socket, which gets you access to the socket which sent the message.",1363271653

They had no interest in building new societies or challenging old ways of doing things. There's a lot of bad to be said about the Puritan Pilgrims, but they <i>did</i> have that ambition, leading to a pattern culminating in experimentation with rational government. (Pirates and the American Indian federations also provided some inspiration.)<p>The Reformation provided an incentive for more nations-- poorer, Protestant ones far from the Mediterranean-- to get involved in (costly, dangerous) exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries. Being unable to compete with the existing powers (especially Spain) directly, they often got into industries (e.g. cotton) that had less short-term yield but more durability.<p>Sea trade itself wasn't that interesting, or even new. Sailing was millennia old already. It was the desire for social and economic experimentation that made that era interesting.<p>This isn't to white-wash that time or say that the experimentation mentality was purely virtuous. There was an incredible amount of ugliness involved (genocide, religious persecution, slavery) in the process.

People do not want to move on.<p>Coming to the specific problem OP has. The wanted to work on fine wines, not WalMart wines. If the best wine in the world, would be sold at WalMart(or any other super market) even at the same price and in the same conditions it would lose immediately value because all the research, experimentation, and everything is lost, and that is a huge part of the experience that you taste with the wine.<p>A practical example: you know how to make the best cake in the world, but it takes a lot of time and it's hard so you can do it only once a year, but you love it, it's your favourite cake so when you make and eat it you love it and you wish you could do more. If WalMart started to sell the same cake you would buy it once or twice but it would not be the same and you probably would end doing once a year as you always did. This is the same problem of OP, people wanted the service, used once or twice and then went back to the old habits.",1363269810

Node is not just about JS on the server, it reflects a paradigm shift -- a movement away from too much abstraction and magic back to lean and simple systems.

From this you can get a better idea of whether it's the method or the coder's skill affecting the results.  Clearly if TDD is better the TDDers will do better than the non-TDDers when both doing TDD because they've more experience.  Comparing the non-TDDers in TDD vs non-TDD will show you if the method alone is enough, or if other factors have affected it (e.g. learning curve of the new method, ability of programmers who chose that method).  The TDDers doing non-TDD helps contribute to the question of are they just better programmers (i.e. do they do comparatively well in non-TDD / are they worse that those TDDers doing TDD).<p>Doing other tests with entirely randomly chosen programmers ensuring they're trained up in these techniques would be another way - though as you point out the training would have to ensure they got the techniques they were being tested against / you'd need to avoid bias of people having spent the last few weeks exclusively in an exclusively TDD environment due to the training.",1363269605

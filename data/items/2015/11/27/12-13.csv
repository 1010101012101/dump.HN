Until you find the problems with the new.</i><p>Sure, it&#x27;s a universal theme that people can get disillusioned with the promises of software (or any technology) but I don&#x27;t think that criticism is relevant to this particular story.<p>What I read in the article is that a few years ago, their hardware was end-of-life (we can speculate that as end-of-lease, or end-of-maintenance, whatever).  It <i>forced</i> them into a big fork-in-the-road type of decision:  do we attempt to build out an internal cloud or go with AWS?  They decided to invest in their datacenter and do it themselves.  It turned out that their internal engineering capability could not match the innovations of AWS.  The Guardian isn&#x27;t hoping for &quot;magic software&quot;.  Any CIO choosing AWS will know they&#x27;ll still have &quot;gaps&quot; in functionality.  (Netflix&#x27;s OSS portfolio built on top of AWS with its staggering array of &quot;housekeeping&quot; software is a good example of highlighting those gaps.[0]) Instead, their multi-year &quot;experiment&quot; told them that their home grown team could not keep up with AWS.[1]<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem so strange since very few companies could hire and maintain the IT competencies to match AWS features even with OpenStack as a foundation.  Facebook Inc and Google Inc have the hard core staff to innovate on their proprietary cloud stacks but The Guardian is a newspaper and not a technology firm.<p>Maybe a lesson here is that OpenStack requires a commitment to supplemental software engineering that&#x27;s beyond the reach of non-tech companies that treat IT as a &quot;cost center&quot;.  WalMart could be one of the few non-tech companies that would be able to innovate on top of OpenStack.[2]<p>[0]<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2kKmMyqTfc&feature=youtu.be&t=35m07s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2kKmMyqTfc&feature=youtu.be...</a><p><a href=""https://netflix.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://netflix.github.io/</a><p>[1]from article:  <i>“We didn&#x27;t manage to deliver self-service, we didn&#x27;t manage to deliver decent load-balancing or autoscaling and actually all the benefits we get from AWS we simply did not get inside of the cloud that we were building internally,” he continued.</i><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/article/2890873/cloud-computing/walmart-doubles-down-on-openstack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2890873/cloud-computing/wal...</a>",1448629072

It introduces code that cannot be optimized, but more importantly it is code that is hard to reason about. The body of the <i>with</i> executes in a scope modified by an arbitrary object, determined at that point in the program&#x27;s execution. To understand the semantics of a use of <i>with</i>, it is necessary to understand everywhere when and how the object that the <i>with</i> is acting on can change.<p>See the tweet by Brendan Eich (inventor of JavaScript) on the with: <a href=""https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/68001466471817216"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/68001466471817216</a><p>From here on, this rest of this comment is probably of little interest, but for those curious about what I mean when I say &quot;reason about&quot; a program let me try to explain in more detail.<p>Programming in an imperative language (i.e. not a functional programming language) involves a series of steps which make changes to the state of the program&#x27;s data. We can&#x27;t desk check interesting programs by working through all interesting steps by hand (or otherwise there is no point in having a computer do it); there are typically just too many steps and iterations. So how do programmers do it?<p>One reasons about the state of a program by examining and understanding how it is affected by each statement. So, for example, in a while loop like:<p><pre><code>    while x != y do\n        x = f(x)\n    end\n    t = x\n</code></pre>\nthe loop does something and even without understanding exactly what the side effects of f(x) are, we are able to reason about the properties of x once the program reaches the point where x is being assigned to t. We know that x equals y and so after the assignment statement we can assert that t, x and y are all equal. Now consider the same while loop with only a slight change:<p><pre><code>       while x != y do\n           x = f(x)\n       end\n    L: t = x\n</code></pre>\nNow the assignment of x to t has a label and can be the destination of a goto statement (I&#x27;m using an example from the bad old days when goto statements could take you anywhere in a program). What can be said about the relationship between t, x, and y after the assignment? It depends on anyplace in the code that can goto to label L. We can no longer reason about the code by examining it statically. We have to understand the global execution and when and where the goto can happen and what the value of x and y might be at each of these potential goto statements during the execution of the program. We&#x27;ve lost the ability to reason about the code in a systematic way by simply looking at it. We would have to consider every possible way the execution of the program could change x or y and then jump to L.<p>Certain programming patterns make understanding programs difficult. Unbridled goto&#x27;s were an early source of such problems. Now, most languages and programers restrict how they use goto to patterns that are safer because they don&#x27;t make reasoning about the programs much more difficult. Dynamic scoping (around since the early days of LISP) makes reasoning about a program&#x27;s state more difficult than lexical scoping; consequently, most programming languages now eschew dynamic scoping in favor of lexical scopes (that is scopes for variables determined by the structure of the source code rather than the dynamic call patterns during execution).<p>The JavaScript &quot;with&quot; is deprecated because it can be applied to an object that is unknown until the program actually runs. The body of the with is executing in this dynamically determined scope so we can&#x27;t really reason about what is going on while looking at the code.",1448628210

Therefore be very mindful of what kind of people you hire and be quick to realize if they don&#x27;t fit the culture (even though they might be good).

Even if it&#x27;s a person who were really bad for the culture it&#x27;s your failure. Even if they leave for a better job it&#x27;s your failure that there is a better job.

This notion partly came from the privilege of never having lived in a war-zone.

10637005,comment,10634918,10634918,0,0,david-given,,,"A couple of months ago I wrote a Forth interpreter, because I&#x27;d always wanted to. I haven&#x27;t really used it in anger, but passes the basic ANS Forth tests, so it should be reasonably complete.<p>(It&#x27;s here: <a href=""https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/blob/master/Applications/util/fforth.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/blob/master/Applicatio...</a> It&#x27;s a single, portable C file which is also an executable shell script containing an awk script! It compiles to about 8kB of code on a microcontroller.)<p>From the experience I learnt two main things about Forth:<p>(a) the realisation of how Forth works, and the way in which the language bootstraps itself out of nothingness, and the way in which it takes about two basic principles and then builds an entire language out of them, is truly mind expanding. The process was full of &#x27;aaah!&#x27; moments when it all came together and I realised just how elegant it was.<p>(b) actually <i>engineering</i> a Forth interpreter, and dealing with the ANS spec, was an exercise in frustration. Those elegant principles are compromised at every stage of the process. The spec defines things which no sane person would define. I&#x27;d implement a word, and it&#x27;d be clean and work, and then the ANS tests would fail and I would realise that the specification dictates a particular half-arsed implementation which makes no sense whatsoever. The process was full of &#x27;uuugh!&#x27; moments when I saw a thing in the spec and realised how much more complicated it would make my life.<p>Examples follow:<p>- double words are pushed onto the stack in high word / low word order. Regardless of whether your architecture is big or little endian. Good luck with using 64 bit load/store instructions!<p>- DO...LOOP is defined to use the return stack for temporary storage. Valid Forth programs can&#x27;t call EXIT from inside a DO...LOOP structure. If you try, your program does a hyperspace jump and crashes.<p>- BEGIN...REPEAT is defined <i>not</i> to use the return stack for temporary storage. Valid Forth programs are allowed to call EXIT from inside a BEGIN...REPEAT structure.<p>- DO...LOOP has different termination characteristics depending on whether you&#x27;re counting up or down.<p>- Mismatched control flow structures are not just not detected, but they are actually, in certain combinations, defined to work. The spec actually defines what some of them do --- IF, THEN, BEGIN, WHILE, REPEAT, if I recall correctly --- and lets you mix and match them. Good luck if you want to use different, more efficient implementations.<p>- The memory model assumes that Forth is the sole owner of the memory. It starts at the bottom and works up. When compiling a word, you have to decide what address it&#x27;s being written to before you know how long it&#x27;s going to be. Want to share the heap with something else? Good luck with that.<p>- Division. How overcomplicated can it be? Answer: extremely.<p>- Rearranging values on the stack gets old very, very, <i>very</i> quickly.<p>- Forth isn&#x27;t typed! Except where it is, and it doesn&#x27;t check them, and if you get them wrong my the gods have mercy on your soul, because the interpreter surely won&#x27;t.<p>I would still say that anybody with any interest in programming should learn at least the basics of Forth, and should write at least the core of a Forth interpreter. (It won&#x27;t take long, and you&#x27;ll learn a hell of a lot.) But I&#x27;d be really hesitant about recommending it for real programming use, other than for the special niches where it excels, such as embedded systems. Most of the problem is that it&#x27;s overspecified; it would be so much simpler, faster, and easier to understand if the spec had more undefined behaviour in it. I now understand why so many people just ignore it and write their own dialect. Strong type checking would really help, too.",1448627815

In a typical setup I&#x27;ll be sliding a new server into a rack, plugging in power and network, powering it up and have it auto-boot to a suitable Linux distro. Then I&#x27;ll leave the data centre. Trigger a provisioning script, and install libvirtd+kvm, or a suitable container technology (e.g. in the timeframe they were working on this, openvz or lxc were both perfectly fine alternatives for a single-tenant system). Now you need a scheduling system: Split each server into N units of type M, add it to an inventory, and add a small API to reserve or release one of them and trigger a kvm/openvz etc. install.<p>Both components here (bootstrap script + resource allocation) can be small. The most recent bootstrap script I wrote was 60 lines.<p>For resource allocation, you can go insanely complex (in which case you should probably consider AWS or installing OpenStack or similar after all), or very, very simple.

It was stupidly easy, all the difficult parts (motion detection, saving short video recordings) are all done for you.<p>I upload everything to s3, and set notifications on the bucket to my phone. If motion is detected, I get an email within a few seconds.<p>If you&#x27;re serious about not being spied on, the only reasonable thing to do is to build it yourself. Luckily, these days, that&#x27;s very easy and cheap.",1448625826

I meant that you get a image of pixels from them, the resolution does not depend on your receiver. The image pixel quality itself (&quot;color&quot;) will be subject to analog effects though. Not a scientist, just a hobbyist with &quot;dangerous semi-wisdom&quot; typing this. ;)",1448625765

You can host code, bug tracker, binaries, and the project website all on Github. I use it to host <a href=""http://postgresapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://postgresapp.com</a>, for example. It&#x27;s extremely convenient.<p>But there is one big gaping security hole: If your project page is served over plain HTTP, and people click on the download link, they are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker could change the link to point to a malicious binary instead.<p>The only way to prevent this is to make sure that your customers don&#x27;t access your website over HTTP. And this is why HTTPS support for Github pages is important.",1448625727

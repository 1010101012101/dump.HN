992577,comment,992218,992557,0,0,gnosis,,,"Yep.  There's nothing that prevents unit tests from being used in a program written in a statically typed language.<p>The difference is that in a program written in statically typed language you'd have to write fewer unit tests than you would were you to use a dynamically typed language, as in the former much of that testing is going to be automatically done for you by the compiler.",1260694017

You start a GPLed open source project.<p>2. Then start to sell licenses to make the software like if it was BSD only for paying customers: PROFIT<p>3. The you get in troubles... like MySQL.<p>4. You ask for help to the community...<p><i>Edit:</i> I'm claiming the GPL is always a bad idea, but it depends on the kind of project. For instance it worked very well for Linux, but does not work so well in other contexts when it's highly likely that companies require to use the code in ways not allowed by the GPL for legitimate business needs (that is, not just to create a closed source version of the project).",1260693309

1440513,comment,1440357,1440357,0,0,jakarta,,,"Here's a bit from Barton Biggs' Hedgehogging that might be insightful:<p>Gerson Bleichroder was a nineteen-century German Jew who had a life filled with immense financial triumph, persecution, and personal sadness. Otto Von Bismarck represented the Old Prussia – aristocratic, agrarian, hierarchic – and it was his ambition and vision that welded the First Reich into an empire. In 1859, when he was 37, Bleichroder became the banker and investment adviser for the rising Junker diplomat, and for 30 years the two leveraged their insights and power to achieve great wealth and prominence…<p>Bismarck, the Prince, worked hard at projecting a magnificent exterior and omnipotence….His primary obsession, other than ruling Germany, was with making money in the stock market so he could buy more and more timberland. He treated everyone around him abominably.<p>However, both men must have had that mystical “seeing eye,” which enabled them to perceive the future chain of events that would be triggered by an action in the present. This is what successful investing still is all about. While suspended in the midst of times that were full of mystery, uncertainty, and doubts, they had the capacity to maintain their pose and world view and never to impatiently or irritably reach for a fact or conclusion.<p>Bleichroder exploited the insights that Bismarck provided to make both his patron and himself very rich. But he also had what Bismarck once referred to as “a certain timidity in investing.” He told his clients he would attempt to get them over the long run a real return (after inflation) of 4% per annum, which would mean that the purchasing power of their wealth would double every 17 or 18 years. His timidity kept him from becoming engulfed in the new-issues market of the 1870s or in the mania for colonial investing that later wiped out so many men and German banking houses. Bismarck was perfectly satisfied with this return, but always withdrew his profits and invested them in land and trees.<p>Bismarck’s appetite for timberland was insatiable. His theory was that the price of land would gradually appreciate in line with population growth, or about two percentage points annually. His studies had convinced him that German forests would grow 2.75% a year, so that his real return for timberland would be around 4.75% per annum, because inflation at the time was virtually zero. If there was inflation, he was sure timberland and log prices would appreciate in line with the inflation. He thought that with very little risk, this was a spectacular compounding of wealth. As it turned out, Bismarck was absolutely right.<p>Over the next half century in Germany of war, inflation, surrender, and depression, timberland held value far better than anything else.",1276811718

Science <i>is</i> progressing faster than ever.  We just need more.  More funding, more education, more scientists, more talent.  Especially in biology, we need a lot more computer scientists, especially the theoretical kind. A probabilistic pi-calculus would do wonders for dealing with the sorts of errors that cost Duane Smith his digits.  We need more mathematicians to help us handle systems of vast and irreducible complexity, and we need more truly excellent experimentalists to pull off what was thought impossible.<p>That's what will help medicine the most, I think.  More and better science, and intelligent people thinking rigorously about process.  It costs money.

A lot of the time you're dealing with a volunteer or parent who has to pay for it themselves and get reimbursed from the organization. This is a pain if you're billed monthly.<p>- Don't spend any effort targeting municipalities or schools. The amount of time and red tape they have to go through to pay for a service like yours isn't worth it for them. And a lot of times their league stuff is a small part of a much bigger software package that runs the whole city or school. If you can't integrate with that, you're out.<p>- Scheduling and registration are where the money is at, everything else should be free to drive traffic to those. Those are by far the two most common and hardest problems for people to solve. They're easier to bill for too since you can do it per instance instead of a subscription. If I were to start over, those would be my focus.<p>- Pick sides: youth or adult leagues? leagues, teams or clubs? You can't possibly serve all 8 combinations of those well through one interface.

Although my surprise is tempered when I think of the arrogance of almost every doctor I've come into contact with - and that's quite a few: an uncommonly persistent neurologist found my pituitary tumour when I was 12 after several others decided I was probably just making up my headaches because I didn't want to exercise.<p>I've dealt with many other specialist and GPs since then and there's always that omniscient, arrogant attitude from them, especially when they don't have an easy answer for you. I've also watched a few people go through medical school and seen them gradually become like this as well.<p>It's a world apart, but IT and software development practices have matured over the last 10+ years and have been forced (sometimes catalysed by business requirements e.g. Sarbanes Oxley) to adopt standards, practices and more thorough documentation than previously.<p>Personally for me it's a narcissistic thrill thinking that you can invent something brand new or solve some problem that someone else couldn't. For me then, the standardisation, extra documentation and the increasing amount of lego-brick style clicking together of existing pieces of wizardry that someone else has built have made IT less exciting.<p>Of course I could go build an incredible open source something or other in my own time but narcissism is about _delusions_ of grandeur, not actual grandeur ;)<p>So the bush I'm beating around is that maybe personal and collective arrogance of medical practitioners has blocked this kind of thing being implemented before?<p>Eastern cultures are much less individualistic - they seem to rely much less on individuals to creatively and independently figure things out in so many fields and situations, preferring to defer to tradition, or predefined rules, or an authority.<p>I'm not saying doctors are irresponsibly arrogant, they do amazing work, most are thoughtful, compassionate and insanely dedicated people who commit their entire lives to what they do.<p>But is the mindset that the rarefied world of medicine and its practitioners being so important and sophisticated that every situation requires years of education and experience to manage holding it back?",1276809081

I agree with him there as well.</i><p>But that argument completely ignores the point of the bet: obviously the average of all hedge funds will underperform after fees, almost everyone agrees with that based on simple arithmetic. The real question is whether funds made up of ""quality"" hedge funds (however that's determined) will outperform or not.<p>...which crucially depends on whether there's any good way to predict how hedge funds will perform.  And that's something that I'm not really sure about - there are absolutely inefficiencies in the market (Buffett made his fortune off of the longer term inefficiencies, so I'm not sure why he's so adamant there are no such systematically exploitable short term ones), and I'm sure some hedge funds profit mightily off of them, but the reality is, too many hedge funds just play ""follow the leader"" with each other, using strategies that are very similar.  These funds exist almost exclusively to collect management fees, not because the fund managers actually have a strategic edge worth pursuing, and for better or worse it's easier to get rich people to put money in a fund if it's similar to the funds that all their rich friends have their money in (niche funds that play unusual strategies tend to have massive trouble finding investors).  So there's a huge middle ground of funds that are mostly following some segment of the market, minus fees - if you could figure out which ones are following each other, it might be possible to pick out the competently managed ones that actually have an edge, but I'm not sure.<p>In any case, this bet is certainly not about average performance of hedge funds vs. average performance of the market, that's pretty much a settled question.  Unfortunately there are no details on how this fund of funds is to be selected, so it's hard to comment further.",1276808631

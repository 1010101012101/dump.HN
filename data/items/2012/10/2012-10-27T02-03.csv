Their `typename` method seems awfully verbose for my liking - in my opinion, definitely harder than the LALR(1) syntax that CUP promotes.<p>Personally, I learnt how to write compilers using a mix of FLEX (the Fast Lexical Analyzer - not by Adobe!) and CUP. From that you create a LALR(1) grammar which then compiles down to a tree (if you choose) which you traverse depth first generating code/assembly/whatever. I would say that this is actually EASIER to write and to understand than trying to do it from scratch - you concentrate purely on the grammar and the tree generation (which leads to code generation or interpretation - e.g. BASIC, code analysis etc).<p>This MAY seem complex as there is a bit of ""black box"" going on behind the scenes (how does it lexically turn characters into symbols? How does it turn those symbols into a grammar which eventually builds a working product?) however once you understand the grammar language (lexical analysis is easy) you find that compilers aren't that difficult. It's a matter of turning code into symbols which you then apply a grammar to. From there (tree/code generation/interpretation) is easy. I would in fact put lexical analysis and grammar generation into a separate toolkit which a compiler developer _uses_ - though it may be from my experience: I welcome other compiler developers to interject.<p>Learning how to write a compiler definitely made me a better programmer - especially in terms of OO languages and also understanding how languages are built (i.e. learning new languages aren't an issue when you know how the internals are likely to work). I highly recommend it for anyone looking to improve their skill set. Unfortunately the course I took at university (which WAS available free on the internet) teaching this concept has now died. It's quite sad that it has disappeared as that paper was hands down my most useful paper I ever took. I've now written compilers for companies converting legacy code to modern code (and native etc) from these skills - it's much more versatile than just generating assembly/machine code!<p>Anyway, I digress: I admire what they are trying to do, however I would recommend others to rather learn FLEX (or JFLEX, CSFLEX etc) and CUP (CSCUP etc) instead of trying to do all the heavy lifting themselves. If they want to write a lexical analyzer or a grammar parser then that is a different journey...",1351306246

It happened to me when I naively used a preforking apache and mod_proxy_balancer on a machine with 2GB RAM.  We had a surge in traffic and the load balancer passed the ""paging threshold"" (it started swapping) and at that point the increased latency caused requests to pile up as users would get impatient and hit reload, leaving processes tied up waiting to time out.<p>In my case I was able to get things working again by disabling all non-essential apache modules and lowering the timeout.  I even had to take the load balancer completely down for a few minutes to get the users to back off long enough to ramp up smoothly again.  Then I switched to nginx and haven't looked back.<p>Obviously I am not comparing my apache instance to App Engine, just the broad strokes of the self-perpetuating failure mode.

4705166,comment,4705069,4705144,12,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Yes, it's clear (to me at any rate) that you're being sarcastic. But, speaking as someone who once was a SAT taker and now is in a position to hire people based on <i>their</i> SAT scores, your sarcasm is unwarranted and you're looking at the SAT in an incorrect light: the SAT, all things considered, <i>does</i> reflect <i>something</i>.<p>It's not a random number the College Board pulls out of their backside. At the end of the day, having an independent company running standardized tests across the nation in dozens of subjects (there's SAT and then there's SAT II) is really a good thing (TM).<p>Interviews are good, but they're not great. You can't have a good interview without good metrics at hand to qualify what you're seeing. There are geniuses that fail at social interaction and will buckle under the pressure of an interview at CalTech, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, etc. or Google, Microsoft, Facebook, & co. but you'd still want; just as there are interviewees that will ace any verbal interview with flying colors (yes, including technical questions) that you wouldn't.<p>At the end of the day: the SAT score, as it was intended to be used, is a datapoint. It's not the be-all end-all: it's an additional piece of information that should be used responsibly to arrive at a good conclusion whether or not to accept/hire an individual.<p>A good score on the SAT + a good score at an interview means that this person not only knows their stuff and can think on their feet, it also means they're hard-working and will do what it takes to do great (believe me, it takes MONTHS (or even years) of dedication to actually ace the PSAT or SAT). A good score on the SAT and poor interviewing means this person is a hard-worker but not particularly great at thinking on his or her feet. A good interview w/ poor SAT scores indicates someone that couldn't be bothered to study for even a month for an important event in their high school career - can you trust him/her to research thoroughly before taking on a big project?<p>The problem is <i>not</i> with the SAT. The problem is with the interviewers at colleges and workplaces around the country that treat it as the Holy Grail. Don't blame the College Board for this one.<p>Anyway, what would you have the SAT replaced with? Don't tell me you'd have colleges accept students based solely on the grades they achieved - in the United States we have some the highest educational disparity across the nation, and even across neighboring cities and suburbs. An A+ at one school may not even be a C at another. Teachers who's pay depends on the evaluation of their kids' academic performance are not necessarily the people you want giving them a number you'd bet the farm on. Just look at the recent Chicago teachers' strike: at the end of the day, pay and compensations aside, it rested on the fact that teachers don't want standardized tests to be used as metrics to determine the quality of their teaching, and they wanted to set the evaluations themselves.<p>The statistical balance of the scores on the PSAT/ACT/SAT/SATII is very well-studied and well-designed, just like with the USMLE medical board examinations and all other engineered standardized tests. There are easy questions, there are medium questions, there are hard questions, and there are flawed questions which can't be answered - before and after every examination, the questions are classified and then re-classified to avoid anomalous or unfair results.<p>Coming up with these questions, organizing the examinations, coming up with the statistical review methods, grading the exams, and getting the results to the universities is not cheap - I paid for all these exams when I was in highschool myself (and my family was lower middle class <i>at best</i>) and while I then considered them to be pretty damn expensive (and that's why I did my best to get the mark I needed the first time around and worked hard to make sure money was not being thrown away), in retrospect the pricing is very fair (although I hear USMLEs are outrageously expensive, but then again, so is everything associated with the medical industry).",1351306102

4705155,comment,4704898,4705095,42,0,agentS,,,"> Go codebases by non experts are peppered with magical incantation (sleeps, etc.) to avoid the dreaded ""all goroutines are sleep"".<p>I'm confused. This is indicative of a deadlock, where no goroutine can make progress. Sleeps would mask the symptoms, yes, but would never actually solve a deadlock, the program would just do nothing for a longer period of time. What Go codebase(s) are you referring to?<p>> A concurrent Go program will likely behave differently given 2 bits (just 2 lousy bits) of difference in the object binary. (runtime.GOMAXPROCS(1) vs runtime.GOMAXPROCS(2)). Imagine someone touching those 2 bits in a ""large codebase"". It is practically impossible to do the same thing in a large Java codebase and fundamentally change the programs runtime behavior. (Happens all the time in Go.)<p>If you are trying to find a low number of bits, you can just use 0. GOMAXPROCS can be set via an environment variable, the function is just to override that value.<p>More to the point, I am convinced that you are wrong. You are saying that in a Java class file, there are no 2 bits I could change that would impact the behaviour of a program, and that is plainly false.<p>> It is very difficult to reason about a Go routine's behavior in a ""large codebase"" without global view and a mental model of the dynamic system e.g. which go routine is doing what and who is blocking and who is not.<p>I guess this could be true if you engineer a system where every goroutine depends on every other goroutine. But it isn't true for code I've seen. As an example, the http library in Go has a goroutine that accepts TCP connections, and a goroutine for every accepted TCP connection. This knowledge is not necessary to use it, and is not necessary if a different part of your program is using it, because it is exposed behind an abstraction (http.Handler). To paraphrase the OP, Go enables simple programming. It doesn't forbid bad programming.<p>> There is nothing, absolutely nothing, that you can do in Go that you can not do via libraries in Java.<p>Depending on what you mean by ""do"", I believe Turing would have something to say on this matter: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness</a><p>> On the other hand, there are plenty of things you can do in Java that are simply impossible to do in Go.<p>Depending on what you mean by ""do"", I either agree with you, or think you are mistaken. If you mean things that you can syntactically write down, like a Giraffe is-a Animal, or an Apple is-a Fruit, then yes, that is impossible to write down in Go. If you mean a problem that can be solved in Java that cannot be solved in Go, then I think you are mistaken.<p>> Once we factor in the possibility for bytecode engineering, then Java is simply in another higher league as far as language capabilities are concerned.<p>Why is this in another league? You can use assembly from Go, meaning you can generate code and jump to it if you really want to. Not sure why this would be considered a special feature of Java, or even why you think Java pioneered this. Bytecode is just a portable assembly, but its just as portable to build per-platform assembly emitters (like compilers do).<p>> Most people who rag on Java are clearly diletantes Java programmers.<p>Right. That makes sense to me; no one who knows anything about Java would ever criticize it. Sarcasm aside, this demonstrates a fallacy in reasoning.<p>> If Go actually manages to be as effective as Java for concurrent programming at some point in the future<p>It isn't more effective now?

So it's no surprise that rigorous design is not the prime factor in popularity of programming languages.<p>I don't think, however, that really explains why research languages these days have very little in common with popular languages - why purity and strict types and all their baggage, despite their promise to make software less buggy, have not been widely adopted.

The devil is in the details, and economists hate details.<p>I don't recall where I heard it, but one of my favorite quotes is that economics takes as its domain the set of solved political problems.

Pretty much defeats the entire point of ""simple"" concurrency, to say nothing of ""scaling"".

Cute little concurrency pet tricks aside, Go concurrent programming actually requires expert level experience.  ""You are doing it wrong"". Of course. Point.<p>- <i>There is nothing, absolutely nothing</i>, that you can do in Go that you can not do via libraries in Java.  Sure, the cute syntactic go func() needs to be replaced with method calls to the <i>excellent</i> java.util.concurrent constructs, but the benefits -- high performance, explicit-no-magic-code -- outweigh the cute factor in this ""programmer's"" book.<p>- On the other hand, there are plenty of things you can do in Java that are simply <i>impossible</i> to do in Go.<p>- Once we factor in the possibility for bytecode engineering, then Java is <i>simply in another higher league</i> as far as language capabilities are concerned.  (Most people who rag on Java are clearly diletantes Java programmers.)<p>If Go actually manages to be as effective as Java for concurrent programming at some point in the future (when they fix the somewhat broken runtime) then the Go authors are permitted to crow about it.  Until that day, go fix_the_runtime() and defer bs().<p>One thing that programming in Go has made me realize is just how awesomely Sun/Gosling, et al. hit that ""practical programming"" sweet spot.  No wonder the modern enterprise runs on Java and JVM.<p>It just works.  (But it is ""boring"" because it's not bling anymore.  Oh well, kids will be kids.)",1351303905

And unlike the new ""personal use license"", it doesn't include new, ambiguous changes to the license text, like the prohibition against ""licensing more than five copies of the software for commercial use in total"" (concurrent or consecutive?) and the restriction that it may only be used on computers that ""you are building for your own use"". Given any reasonable interpretation of ""build"", this should exclude, say, a MacBook, and it leaves open questions about computers that <i>I own</i> but am <i>""building"" for the use of others</i>.<p>I suspect the real reason for this train wreck of an EULA is that ""no retail copies"" is yet another stick to force volume license users to purchase software assurance, as it <i>does</i> mean that the only current-version Windows base license available to companies with more than five seats is the restricted, nontransferable OEM EULA.

I think what Yahoo is doing is the right thing for them, for their users, and for the web.<p>If the web is going to be ad supported, then its going to have to be targeted advertising or its going to be both shit and annoying. Remember ""punch the monkey"", or ads that took over the entire screen? Now, through tracking, we are able to get really really good ads - things you might even be interested to see and buy.<p>If DNT was supported by everybody and on by default, that's the end of online advertising in its current form. So we can choose from the following options: ignore DNT, ignore DNT for IE10, or go back to non-targeted advertising.<p>Let's assume the last of those, which leads us to the following options: revert to shit ads, make users pay for content directly, or pack up your content-producing company and go home. None of these are best for the users or the web.<p>The DNT founders know this - that's why it was default null in the spec and in Firefox. IE10 is doing this deliberately even though they know it can't work, and there are choices here: they are trying to improve the world but are incredibly wonderfully naive, they want to undermine Google, or they want to undermine DNT.

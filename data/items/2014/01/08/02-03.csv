A &quot;bzr branch&quot; with a shared repository will only populate the working tree and does not have to duplicate the repository.

Hell no, except for a $300k+ job in banking or the Valley, and only then knowing that I could get on a plane and leave if I got sick. (You can get 100-200k in the EU; at the 300k level, the jobs start getting rarer in the EU relative to the US, which is why Wall Street gets a surprising amount of French, German, and Italian talent-- if probably not as much as The City.)<p>If you look at the country in totality and taking into account its full history and what it has overcome, and how rapidly it can change itself when needed, the US is a great country. I don&#x27;t mean to imply that I think it&#x27;s better than others (I wouldn&#x27;t begin to be competent in that comparison) and its history is all kinds of fucked up (genocide of native people, slavery, internment of Japanese-Americans) but there&#x27;s a lot to be proud of, too.<p>Would I live here if I were born European? Barring an unusually good job offer that couldn&#x27;t be found elsewhere, no. And any patriotic pride I might be inclined to have as an American (and I don&#x27;t have much, because this country is full of assholes, too) I would just as much have if I were born elsewhere.

(no filters, but they are supervised and we can see what&#x27;s on their monitors at all times)<p>The only stuff I have seen them accidentally stumble upon is the odd bikini image in Google Image Search.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine any scenario how a four year old could accidentally stumble upon rape porn (which is the type that&#x27;s supposedly psychologically damaging, right?). In particular because they can&#x27;t type (they lack the motor skills).<p>(actually I&#x27;d question how four-year-olds &quot;surf the web proficiently&quot; at all, for any definition of &quot;proficiently&quot; and any reasonable definition of &quot;the web&quot;. Public libraries are easier to use, they&#x27;re not proficient at those either)<p>In a hypothetical thought experiment, give 1,000,000 four-year-olds a tablet with a browser opened on a child-friendly start page, and let them play for an hour. None of them will stumble upon rape porn. The &quot;proficient&quot; ones will find something fun and colourful to play with. Your biggest problem is the ones that don&#x27;t, get stuck on something boring, and start crying. Good luck with that.</i><p>My 4yo stumbled on porn so this is my personal experience. A co-worker of mine says his 5yo that has also.<p>><i>Also not true. I put this to the test back when we still had these filters enabled. The two smartest kids (ages 11-12) couldn&#x27;t do it, there&#x27;s just too many hurdles, passwords, blocking, safeguards going on. It&#x27;s horrible software, really cripples the machine (which is one of the reasons why we got rid of it, favouring simple supervision). It&#x27;s quite hard to disable even if you are the administrator of these PCs. Super easy to set up, though. It&#x27;s a real trapdoor.<p>I have to admit I believe that they might have had a better chance if they could read English natively. At age 11-12 Dutch kids can read English, but not fast enough to do proper research on the English language web (so the solution would be for English parents to install Chinese filters, they got the experience anyway :-P).<p>Kids ages 8 or lower couldn&#x27;t do it no matter the language. There may be the odd (extremely) high-functioning exception, but we were talking about most kids.<p>And by the time they&#x27;re 16 it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a parental filter or a government one, they can--and will--get around government-grade censorship too. But then, a 16-year-old mind can think of depravities with or without help of the Internet.<p>Just because children get better at computers than their parents all the time, doesn&#x27;t mean developmental stages suddenly disappear. See <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stage"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stages</a>\n</i><p>I personally got around more than one of them when I was 12 so again, this is my personal experience.

In earlier schemes, you got the content preferred by patrons (royalty and/or the Church), or what could support small roving troups of actors, players, musicians, bards, raconteurs, etc.  Back in the 1980s I was watching an early &quot;festival of computer animation&quot; and noticed that shorts from cigarette advertisments (largely from Europe) featured <i>heavily</i>.  It was, effectively, the Church for patronage of CGI development (nascent and expensive at the time).<p>The syndication need <i>not</i> be through a single agency, and there are existing examples in the music industry (not that that&#x27;s perfect either):  you&#x27;ve got The Harry Fox Agency, ASCAP, SESAC, and BMI.  For airtime play there is both logs (of airplay) and sampling methods to determine who gets paid for what.  The licensing even covers live performance venues such as bars and nightclubs.  There it&#x27;s the club owner, not the band, who has the license for performances (it&#x27;s much easier to conduct audits and enforcement against a street address than with a band whose location isn&#x27;t fixed, has few assets, and can scatter to the winds).<p>The other question is how to link receipt and payment.  In many locations, Internet access is sufficiently concentrated (often monopolized) that tying major providers into the scheme might work.  Access bundles <i>could</i> be tied to your Internet subscription, possibly with tiers of service or credits available for content.  This removes the problem of subscribing individually to different source publishers, though it could drive up the cost of Internet access.<p>Another approach would require more government involvement, essentially an income- or wealth-indexed content tax (addressing the &quot;ability to pay&quot; scenario).  Collections are based on payment ability, _distribution_ is based on actual access and utilization.<p>There are a lot of thorny details, and the question of whether or not there&#x27;s a process path from the present system to something resembling what I&#x27;m suggesting is very much unsettled.<p>Using my preferred reference for economic data, xkcd&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; chart, the total size of the US arts and entertainment industry is $528 billion, where the publishing industry is $152 billion.

Ideally the library is developed with care, breaking changes between major versions are minimized, and breakage due to implementation changes are minimal owing to lack of scope (literally) for clients to depend on implementation details.<p>But under the model you describe, you&#x27;re leveraging the Theory of the Firm as much as possible - specifically, reducing the transaction costs of potentially updating clients of libraries simultaneously with the library itself.<p>The downside is the risk of unnecessary coupling between clients and libraries - the costs of a breaking change aren&#x27;t so severe, so the incentive to avoid them is lessened, and so the abstraction boundaries between libraries is weakened. If the quality of engineers isn&#x27;t kept high, or they don&#x27;t know enough about how and why to minimize coupling, there&#x27;s a risk of a kind of sclerosis that increases costs of change anyway.",1389146507

In fact, you must plan for them as a matter of course.<p>So yes, modularity is great, and I because I&#x27;m a nice guy I assume Facebook aren&#x27;t a pack of idiots and that they&#x27;re writing nice modular code. But even if that&#x27;s the case, in an organization of Facebook&#x27;s size you still need to make widespread, atomic refactorings on a regular basis.<p>I know this from experience, because I work at Google (much larger codebase than Facebook) on a low-level piece of our software stack. We face these issues regularly and while working in a single repo has its drawbacks, it also has real advantages.",1389146418

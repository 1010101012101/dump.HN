You like a product, you try to support as if you created it and as if the company cares for you, while in reality the company doesn't care about you and you're just doing free marketing for them.<p>Not to say that you can't defend what you like, but most of what you've written here is very very subjective. One could argue otherwise too, and which is what is happening right here - You're adding subjectivity to your claims and provoking a 'fanboy' war.

For example they frequently market saying ""The world's best Operating System (referring to Mac OS)"" or ""The fastest phone ever"" etc. while these are not true. The iPhone for instance, still runs on a dual core processor. How the fuck can it be the 'fastest' while high-performance quadcore chips were long released even before this phone came into existence?<p>Where were you during Apple's presentations?

4711905,comment,4709887,4711810,1,0,saurik,,,"> I personally agree with that, as I do not believe that the notability requirement is leading to increased article trustworthiness.<p>> Interesting idea, and I'd like to hear more of this idea! However, from this I suspect you are mixing up the reliability of an article and the specific phrase ""notability"" (about how deserving a topic is to have an article). When deciding if an article is notable it will usually have little or no history!<p>The reason I am ""mixing this up"" is that the only argument I have ever heard for why Wikipedia needs a notability policy at all is the one that was cited by britta earlier in this thread: that without such a clause there would be tons of articles that are hardly ever looked at by anyone, hardly ever edited by anyone, and containing information that is difficult to verify. I believe that there are numerous better solutions to this than attempting to use the ""notability"" filter, as I maintain that ""notability"" does not actually lead to ""veracity"".<p>To be very clear about this, I will repeat the context from britta that started my involvement in this discussion:<p>>> The notability guideline (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability</a>) is closely related to the verifiability policy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>)  from Wikipedia's perspective, if a subject has not been covered by multiple reasonably reliable secondary sources (in other words, if it isn't ""notable""), we can't write a reasonably verifiable article about that subject. Every article has to include secondary sources as references, so that editors and readers can quickly fact-check.<p>Going back to your response:<p>> Its difficult because we simply do not know where NYT got that info: if Diggnation showed them some real figures (say, a screenshot) then the NYT article is better than a tweet!<p>I must apologize here, as I was intending to be using a different example, but you took me to mean the Diggnation example: this is my fault, I should have been more clear.<p>What was coming to mind with relation to the ""Twitter post"" example, is that there is a ton of journalism on topics I directly care about that is based on the Twitter feeds of people I work with: a lot of ""person X said Y"", which is then translated into some article on what is or is not possible with a tool that person X builds. The fact that a reporter read that statement and repeated it doesn't make it more true, and in fact the opposite is quite common: they are paying sufficiently little attention and have sufficiently little background knowledge that they repeat it wrong.<p>Please understand: I am not talking about a situation of ""interpretation"" or ""research"", but more like establishing dates on when things happened... I understand that this feels pretty blurry (but it seems equally silly to go into a detailed example of something where my example is itself biased; I am happier sticking with the examples such as Diggnation and RSA); it is simply a situation where ""that dude at Wired that finds this stuff gets him readers"" is not somehow more trustworthy than the place he got the information from... either the information shouldn't be published at all (I believe this is probably a quite reasonable course of action), or ""that dude at Wired"" should be skipped and the original source should be used.<p>That said, part of your comment doesn't rely on that misunderstanding I caused: it is true that we don't know where the NYT got that information, however that uncertainty really doesn't make it any more true; while it means there is some possibility that the information was gathered in a way that we should indirectly trust, as we can't see it we can't verify it, and it is honestly not in any way better than if some random person on Wikipedia just asserted it to us... reporters for major publications (such as the New York Times and Washington Post, both of which I have first-party experience with due to articles written about my work) really do trust that you are a reliable source on things that you control, and really do attempt to fact check by calling you back for verification.",1351513151

Where I want to repair it. Where I want to buy parts. If I want to sell it. and so on and so on.<p>Once sold, the new owner should have complete control, and all <i>rights</i> should belong to him.

4711896,comment,4711786,4711786,41,0,georgespencer,,,"There's so much about this which is disingenuous. I'm not surprised by this, but it's worth pointing out some of the tricks Amazon are employing here:<p>1. Much More for Much Less. Much More is obviously the kindle fire HD, and Much Less is the iPad Mini. Heck, if you remove the 'f' of 'for' you get to the central point here which is to turn the choice into 'Much More or Much Less'.<p>2. Kindle Fire HD branding is used (sexy typeface, orange gradient), iPad mini has some weird typeface which a cynic might argue has been deliberately spaced to make it look antiquated and unprofessional.<p>3. The Kindle Fire is ""stunning"" and the iPad Mini is ""standard"".<p>4. Just because the iPad Mini display is high definition and has 30% more pixels than the iPad Mini, it doesn't mean that the iPad Mini is a ""low resolution"" display.<p>5. Because the iPad Mini has a bigger screen in the same overall form factor, they make the same point a different way (""30% more pixels than the Mini"" => ""216 pixels per inch""). If the Kindle had a bigger screen but lower PPI they'd put the screen size in here.<p>6. ""Watch HD movies and TV"" ""No HD movies or TV"". The phrasing here is very clever. To a technically competent individual it parses as ""no HD content on iPad Mini, only standard definition"". But the ""and TV""/""or TV"" phrasing means that an average consumer might assume that you can't get any TV shows on iPad Mini.<p>7. The screen of the Kindle Fire is odd looking. The iPad Mini behind it is on its default home screen. I'm guessing that the Kindle Fire has deliberately been shown all in black (with the bg the same colour as the bezel) because it makes it unclear where the bezel ends and the screen begins.   (I don't know if this is the default setting of the Kindle Fire HD or not).<p>8. The iPad Mini has been photoshopped horribly. For a start I have no idea which iOS that is, but it's not the one which ships with the iPad Mini or the one which Apple are using in any of their promotional shots. If you overlay one of Apple's promotional shots on top and adjust the size and opacity, you'll see that the iPad Mini has been warped so that the icons seem slightly smaller and the positioning is off.<p>8. Ultra-fast MIMO Wi-Fi vs. A BLANK SPACE. Not even trashing the fact that there is Wifi in the iPad but it's not as fast. It looks like they just gave up at this point.<p>Again, I'm not blaming Amazon for any of this. It's just interesting to see how much thought has gone into basically attempting to deceive consumers.",1351513005

4711878,comment,4711367,4711824,6,0,dsr_,,,"Three plausible answers:<p>1. Remove the barriers. Drop import and export restrictions, drop punitive tariffs, reduce taxes; at the same time, make restrictive DRM and equivalents (copyright controlling imports, in the instant case) illegal. This will reduce production costs and reduce selling prices. Overall, standard of living will rise slightly where production costs are low and sink more dramatically where production was formerly located. Eventually, the markets should reallocate themselves efficiently, but it can be a long and painful process and lots of people will get hurt.<p>2. Enforce all the barriers more rigorously. Apply import tariffs on everything, support local producers by mandating price floors, don't allow reimportation at all. Smuggling becomes much more lucrative, as does the black market. Advances in miniaturization mean that we can track fractional ownership of everything; instead of buying a coffee machine, you rent one, along with the mugs and spoons. (Clearly we need to reduce frictional costs immensely, or else the inertia drags us to a halt.)<p>3. We continue to muddle through, with incremental improvements when we (as a society, not we as hackers) recognize the need. Markets get regulated, but not very well or efficiently.

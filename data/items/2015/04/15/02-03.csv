You don&#x27;t have that freedom with SaaS -- if the service provider goes away, so does your ability to run the software).<p>Now, one can be in agreement with the idea that the four freedoms are important, especially as we increasingly live in a world where software is not only convenient, but necessary in our daily lives -- but the idea with the AGPL, and why it is needed for server software -- is pretty clear.",1429066768

I&#x27;ve set up a file backup method, where the RPi &quot;pulls&quot; files from my PC via my home network, but does not grant the PC read or write access.

Simple truth is that in digital age, some computer operators with a little bit more of a visual culture are perceived as a designers. Nope. I am learning visual artistry from 6 years old. First started at school, then from old masters by serving them like a dog, then when digital era started i learned more about the medium, then learned about the business by risking it all, than learned about the psychology of perception, culture impact, age differentiation, then learned to think from user perspective, to measure reaction and get critical design data from it.... Now when i am almost 40 years old i can say that i can make a good design. Not only because of a talent, intuition or experience. Mostly because my life is a direct result of my design.

This suggests that those companies were thinking something along the lines of what I was suggesting: that this purchase was trying to manipulate prices, so the money made would not be from the trade directly.<p>>&quot;[...] This price development on the London market led 16 cocoa companies and trade associations to send a letter to NYSE Liffe to complain that “a manipulation of the contract” was “bringing the London market into disrepute”. Many market commentators argued that this\nbackwardation was fuelled by a squeeze, which is a trader or a group of traders deliberately disrupting the supply of physical cocoa to artificially increase the price of cocoa futures contracts which are about to expire, and hence to profit from it while other traders find themselves struggling to fulfil their obligations. In response to this allegation, NYSE Liffe advised that it did not find any evidence of\nabusive trading behaviour on the cocoa market.&quot; (ICCO report [1]) //<p>You said the price &quot;tumbled off a cliff, dropping to a low of ~£1,8200 in November 2010&quot;. According to the chart you linked a tonne of cocoa averaged [?] £2.11k [in London?] in July 2010 when Amajaro made the trade. So why would companies be complaining about backwardation then? [2] Says the price was pushed up and rose by 0.7% after the purchase.<p>Presumably then those with warehoused stock that&#x27;s accessible can undercut Amajaro in order to bring down the price? But if there are sufficient goods for this then the &quot;other traders find themselves struggling to fulfil their obligations&quot; from [1] makes no sense.<p>Also seemingly there was a major issue with Ivory Coast [aka <i>Cote d&#x27;Ivoire</i>] being under a flood warning, that previous years had returned deficits in terms of the global demand vs. the global harvest. Was this the issue that broke Ward: There were various embargoes and shenanigans around the Ivory Coast&#x27;s presidential elections and when they eventually shipped the harvest proved excellent and there were massive excesses [1].<p>><i>So yeah, obviously Armajaro lost a bunch of money on that trade, precisely because of the volume they were working with.</i> //<p>Looks like a top estimate for that is -£72M based on the July to November price change for 240k tonnes.<p>>* Nor would this trade have made sense if Armajaro had known that prices were going to spike due to an external shock; then they should have bought options, not actual physical cocoa.* //<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but you can&#x27;t corner the market that way because the seller can default; moreover a future glut can come in and wipe out your position and/or movement of goods can alleviate the local shortfall [it&#x27;s something like 3-4 weeks to ship cocoa from US warehouses to European buyers]. Thus it wouldn&#x27;t create a clamour in the market to ensure that delivery of the commodity can continue, as was apparently the case here?<p>- - -<p>Couple of figures that are pertinent:<p>* Re your edit [3] puts a figure of £40M on the 2002 trade, Wikipedia reports a £58M gain.<p>* Ward&#x27;s CC+ fund made 15% in 2010, not exactly sure how much that is but it seems to have been £25M based on some other figures (all Amajaro funds passing £1B, CC+ being 20%, working backwards from [4]).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.icco.org/about-us/international-cocoa-agreements/doc_download/442-the-world-cocoa-economy-past-and-present-26-july-2012.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icco.org/about-us/international-cocoa-agreements/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/7895242/Mystery-trader-buys-all-Europes-cocoa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/7895242/Mystery-t...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/7897075/British-financier-Anthony-Ward-behind-658m-cocoa-trade.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/789...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/06/anthony-ward-letters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/06/anthony-ward-letters/</a>",1429063316

Still, I&#x27;d not have it connected to the network and I would wipe the Pi&#x27;s SD card afterward, just to be sure.

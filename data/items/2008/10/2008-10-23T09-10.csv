I'm sure he will oblige.<p>They just want to talk to you to get everything set up like you want/need it.<p>How much memory does your server need? Need a backup solution? How bout an apc module? What are the bandwith requirements, do you need multi or single gigabit lines? Like I said, their business works more on a case by case basis instead of select a, b or c and proceed to checkout. 
I'm not saying you <i>have</i> to join them, but they're a good, solid serviceprovider.",1224755438

341037,comment,340743,340743,0,0,chmike,,,"Yes the question is bogus since 1 million 32bit integers require 4MB storage.<p>Here is my solution. Select the 500.000 smallest values, sort them using an in place sorting algorithm and spit them out, then select the 500.000 biggest values, sort them and spit them out.<p>The problem then boils down to select the n/2 smallest values of the list. To do this I store the n/2 first values in the 2MB buffer. I then organize them into a heap with the biggest at the top. I then process the remaining n/2 values. When one of these values is bigger than the heap top value, it is skipped. If it is smaller, the heap biggest value is replaced with the smaller value and the heap is restored to get the biggest value at the top. When all the n/2 values have been processed, the 2MB buffer contains the n/2 smallest values of the million integer list.<p>Since it is already organized as a heap one can use heap sort to sort it. Pick the biggest value at the top and swap it with the last value of the list and restore heap to get the next biggest value at the top. Swap it with the last unsorted value and proceed until the heap length is reduced to one element.<p>Apply the same algorithm with the n/2 biggest value but using a heap with the smallest value at the top.<p>This algorithm requires two passes over the million integer, and uses nothing more than the 2MB buffer.<p>The complexity is O(nlog).",1224754130

341035,comment,339755,339845,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Yours is really a poor definition for “developed nation.” A more standard definition of development is based the amount of available capital in an economy.  Compared to W. Europe, Japan, N. America, etc., India has a pitifully low amount of capital, per capita (also a poor population: 25% is still below the official poverty line, etc.).  Interestingly, one of the chief factors slowing Indian economic growth may be that it has avoided specializing in products requiring cheap unskilled labor (e.g. textiles), as China, etc., have, instead wielding protectionist policies which supported local capital but ultimately weakened its ability to compete on the world market, and other regulation, like draconian labor laws, which have discouraged direct foreign investment.

I know how to build/manage stuff, so I want to know how much it costs to have a server there.  The less they have to do, the better for both of us - the only thing I need them for is to kick the hardware if it has a problem.",1224753059

Their articles are indispensable, and their control panel is simply world class.<p>What I dislike is Rackspaces shady pricing practise, the fact that whenever I've dealt with Rackspace as I've come away with quotes that were wildly excessive, and generally the view that Rackspace are a large company focused on new sales through hard-selling practises rather than focusing on customer service and their existing customer base.<p>To me, Rackspace are the most-reputed of a very bad bunch (the best of the worst). Slicehost are the shining star of a new breed (the best of the best).<p>As a Slicehost customer I really do not want to see Slicehost become anything like Rackspace, at all. Instead I want to see the opposite, Rackspace become more like Slicehost. But will that happen? Well... did the Slicehost guys get Rackspace board seats? There's your answer.<p>I'll wait and see, but whilst I had loyalty to Slicehost and the people there I won't feel loyalty towards Rackspace. Should I feel any affect on the service I receive, through price increase, impact on backups, downtime, etc... I'll jump.<p>As others have said: DON'T FUCK IT UP, RACKSPACE.<p>Not least because with this many entrepreneurs here with growing ventures, it might not be the wisest business decision to piss them all off.",1224752912

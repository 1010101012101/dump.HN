Create a new empty table T'.<p>2. Add a trigger on T that will clone any operations to T'.<p>3. Copy all rows from T to T' in clustering order.<p>4. Atomically switch the tables so that T' becomes T.<p>Unlike CLUSTER, the only lock required is in step 4, when it needs an exclusive lock on the table; it cannot do the switch until all current transactions are done with T (you can specify a timeout). The only other drawback is that that it does not support TRUNCATE, CREATE INDEX, or some ALTER TABLE operations being run while it's busy in step 3.<p>Also, unlike PostgreSQL's own CLUSTER command, it does not need an index to order by.<p>We run pg_repack regularly at night to keep our databases clustered. It works really well, though I really wish Postgres could get native online clustering. SQL Server has had automatic clustering for many years, as has DB2, and Oracle has index-ordered tables.",1362265191

Look for something with sane work hours and that's a seller's market labor-wise. ""Boring"" fields like accounting are a good bet. Then live below your means, save, and pursue your art <i>seriously</i>. Make a commitment to it above other things.

I've spent endless amounts of time in several non-tech IPOs, and public-to-private transactions. I can safely say that ""I know how the investment industry works"".<p>(i) price != value. For argument sake, lets say you go off to an pay $1 million for a 500 sqft in Portola. Is the price of the house $1 million, yes, you paid for it. Is it worth it, no. Investors are specialist at making both terms look the same.<p>(ii) Groupon is Groupon. Groupon is not Silicon Valley, Groupon is not Amazon, Groupon does not represent any other company/industry other than itself. Do not go the Amazon, Webvan, etc. route, because mixing stories does not make the story any more right. Groupon's fundamentals: revenue growth, customer-acquisition-cost, customer lifetime value, gross margins, working capital needs and cash flow generation were ""not there"". They never were. The IPO value could not be justified with even the most basic arithmetic.

The SEC could of asked (and should ask) 1,2,3,4,5, etc independent companies (be it McKinsey, an auditor such as KPMG or any corporate finance boutique) to provide a Fairness Opinion on the valuation (the right incentives should be put in place to avoid any conflict of interest in the future from potential revenues/business arising from the company one is analysing). If there is a large discrepancy between the Fairness Opinion and IPO price the IPO should be cancelled and any share trade should only be between qualified investors (but not in the stock exchange). If I were an investor, I would strongly vote against this... but now that I'm not, I can say this is an effective way of avoiding this pump and dump schemes.",1362264141

Many statements below are generalizations.<p>Two lessons from my parents: (1) money is very important and (2) you must be excellent in your career (in that order).<p>Chinese, specifically, are all about wishing wealth onto one another. Although too much focus on wealth accumulation can be a bad thing, it is at least a ""good problem"". Many of my peers have the intelligence and ambition but villainize the concept of doing something for the money. The article itself implies that these 20somethings are the victims to their wealth-accumulating bosses (who, from the description of it, are entrepreneurs who run very high risk operations). Too many upper-middle children brought up in the early 90s have seen money's ugly side: divorce, Wall-Street, Jim Carrey's Liar Liar  etc. These 90s kids are brought up by overworked parents, anti-money tenured teachers and non-profit workers. The media and the occupy movement have made it worse by victimizing these 20somethings encouraging more people to villainize wealth.<p>It's also important to note that the parents are out of touch with today's job market. Parents of today's 20-somethings feel like it was ONLY their hard work that got them there and consequently that their children are entitled to pursue their dreams. They forget that their generation had unions, pensions, government jobs, low interest rates and most importantly the creation of dual income. Today's 20somethings face those debts, specialized jobs, dying industries, outsourcing and lots of competition.<p>That being said, I think parenting for the next generation (or even re-educating 20somethings now) it's all about a balance. I don't think you have to push your daughter to be a physician necessarily. Young people just have to understand and appreciate the value of money which means teaching them about taxes, the value of health benefits, financing, leasing and investing. With that in mind, they can find a good solution or at least a compromise.<p>EXAMPLE USING ABOVE RANT:\nDaughter wants to be a ballerina. Explain to her that the prima ballerina (#1 dancer) earns less than $140,000 per year and that her career is very short. The expected pay for a ballerina falls short of $10,000/yr. If she wants to do ballet, she can find her another career that has better earning potential and dance as a hobby.",1362263715

Rejecting my passphrase and accepting ""abc123"" is <i>wrong</i>. That's my original post, and that's what you objected to.  Computer generated random passwords that nobody's going to use on their mobile phone Evernote client, simply don't figure into normal human use.<p>Our job is to recommend things that can help real people use tech more safely.<p>> <i>""the entropy of a randomly (not user!) selected password is not estimated in this manner, but calculated according to the same formula I provided: H = log_2 (b^L), where b is the number of letters in the alphabet (95) and L is the length of the password""</i><p>Yes, I'm aware of that.  Using that site's check, ""correct horse battery staple"" comes out weaker at 104.2 bits, so I listed that weaker ""lower bound""[1] for that phrase.  I'm happy to use whatever formula comes up with less entropy for reasons discussed in [1].<p>I also don't care when sharing with less technical users if it's exact. I care if I can point them to a URL that gives a reasonable approximation, which that ""quick check"" does.  For users who want to do math, I listed both approaches:<p>> <i>1. Quick entropy check:</i> <a href=""http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php</a><p>> <i>2. Manual entropy check:</i> <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log_2%282048%5E4%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log_2%282048%5E4%29</a><p>The ""manual"" check is pre-filled with your suggested formula.  It's interesting to compare the entropy check to <a href=""http://www.passwordmeter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.passwordmeter.com</a> which I think users will ""solve"" as if it were a password meter puzzle, in very predictable ways.<p>Meanwhile, to an attacker trying the whole character space, ""correct horse battery staple"" is log2(27^28) or 133.1 bits of entropy.

Any serious valuation number is based on somebody actually buying shares at that price, generally a professional investor with a lot of experience. The price of a thing is what the thing will bring.<p>Whether or not they're realistic is hard to say because they are bets on wildly unpredictable situations. Not long after Amazon IPOed, I considered shorting the stock because I thought it was wildly overvalued. Now it's worth circa 100x what it was worth then.<p>Qualified investors are just people with enough money that they are presumed to know what they're doing. The reason non-qualified investors generally can't buy in early is precisely because the SEC is protecting them from getting taken for a ride. The whole ""going public"" thing is mainly about disclosing enough that you're following the investor protection rules.<p>I agree that Groupon is a hot mess, but I don't expect that any rules were broken, and I don't know what new rule could have prevented it without doing more harm than good. Do you have something in mind?<p>My guess is that the people who bought Groupon stock made one of two classic mistakes. One is buying shares because they like the product. The other is buying because it's hot. I've seen professional investors make those mistakes too, and learn some valuable lessons thereby. It's sad that a lot of people had to learn those lessons with Groupon. But the SEC isn't there to protect people from ignorance or bad trading strategies. They're just there to stop fraud and cheating.",1362261903

5311282,comment,5304873,5310221,1,0,Peaker,,,".) At our workplace, we use preallocation for almost everything. When we do dynamic allocations, typically it is from free-lists from pools that we pre-allocate.<p>Almost all of our allocation/freeing costs are cheap O(1). Pretty much everything is zero-copy. That is why I cringe a little when I hear that GC's are ""faster than manual MM"". Because manual MM done well can eliminate almost all of the costs of memory management.<p>I also cringe a little when I see ""malloc"" deep inside C functions.<p>I really like the basic convention in C that you should pass needed allocations in as arguments (and it is virtually always possible) allowing these allocations to be members of of members of other allocations, aggregating allocations so there are much fewer.<p>.) Information regarding heap-allocs is relatively easy to obtain with ""oprofile"", look up the time spent in ""malloc"" and ""free"" and the related functions underneath them.<p>.) C makes it very easy to use an array of the values you want, rather than an indirection. For Lists, I don't think that is a useful idea. For hash tables, given that many entries are empty, I think it is a better trade-off to have your hash array as an indirection, though the buckets could be explicitly put together. And so on.<p>I often encountered dynamic allocation overheads are noticeable or even huge chunks of my runtime when I had to work with code that used them.  Reducing the dynamic allocation really helps. We're not safe, we need to work towards it explicitly.",1362261754

Offline / sync - you can have out-of-sync or offline clients (e.g mobile apps) inserting new data without worrying about pk mismatch or collisions.<p>2. security - it's obviously a bit of security through obscurity, but not being able to guess the key of an object can be very useful some time. It shouldn't be relied on as a first line of defence, but it gives you a naturally impossible-to-guess reference. If you want to avoid someone crawling through your image-base or any object that is generally accessible, but you want to avoid having it accessible in-bulk, UUID is your friend.<p>3. Silly mistakes - If you pass an object id, you really want to know it can only be for one object. Maybe the front-end is sending an id of one object, but the backend is working on another (shit happens). When you use sequential ids, you increase the chance of weird stuff going on. With UUIDs you simply can't use the wrong id, even by mistake.",1362261622

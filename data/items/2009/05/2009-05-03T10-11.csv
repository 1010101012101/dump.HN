This is in line with the article's <i>internalization</i> point.<p>I'm also wary of reducing my understanding to code or even written notes before it is settled, because it is much more malleable in the mind. This is in line with the article's <i>transformability</i>.<p>Interesting point about gestures. My thinking is very kinesthetic, so I might try that.",1241347845

590766,comment,590479,590695,0,0,DougBTX,,,"> Where'd it go?<p>I know you didn't mean it like this, but this is actually an interesting question. On Windows, the files probably went into the Program Files directory, but if you try to go there in Windows explorer, you get a ""these are system files, keep out"" warning. Which is quite correct, you wouldn't expect an end user to open an application from Program Files, there will probably be a bunch of unrelated exes to distract you.<p>So where is it? I guess the answer is ""in the start menu"". People probably believe that abstraction, to the point that MS had to put a ""this is just a shortcut, you need to use add remove programs to actually delete the application"" message.<p>Package managers, much the same story. Where are the binaries? In a versioned repository somewhere, on mac ports somewhere under /opt/local. How do you run them? Type their name in the command line, often you ignore where the files actually are.<p>And finally, back to OS X itself. How do you install an application? Drag it into the applications directory.<p>Where is it? It's in Applications. How do you run it? Go to Applications and double click on it.<p>The only case I've pointed to where the answers to ""how do I install it"", ""where is it"" and ""how do I run it"" end up in the same place, the Applications directory, is where you point out a usability issue. User interface design is hard!<p>My guess is it comes down to expectations. ""Go to the Applications folderand click on the application I want to run? It can't possibly be that simple!"" and then spend 15 minutes looking for a pull down menu to launch the application.",1241347176

590761,comment,590460,590460,0,0,10ren,,,"I wrote the first version of my app in 2 hours - but it took a year of iteration to become a salable product.<p>(1) the first version worked, but it was the <i>minimal</i> feature set you could imagine. That's one way to code fast.<p>(2) The 2 hours doesn't include thinking about it, designing it and using other tools in the same area. So I really just <i>typed</i> it in 2 hours. The lack of bugs just showed that I understood the problem, and that the design of the code was simple enough to be trivial to debug (and having minimal features). This is another way to code fast.<p>I use google, docs, etc for sample code. I use it in two ways: (1) to help me understand; and (2) if it's not at the core of what I'm doing, I'll imitate how others do that part (e.g. how to use an API). The idea is to carefully apportion my time and energy - it's easy to waste heaps of time understanding something incidental to my task, when that time and effort is needed for understanding the important things.<p>Understanding is the difficult part. That's what programming is really about for me - not the looking up docs/typing/debugging.",1241346422
590760,comment,590374,590374,0,0,radu_floricica,,,"I find it a bit disappointing when people, even on HN, argue on such topics like they are a method of opinion or life experience. If you read even a couple of books on evolution, even at a science popularization level (Richard Dawkins being a good example) it's pretty clear genders are far from identical. And that has been so since the first living things separated in genders. Everything, of course including behavior, is influenced by gender.<p>This of course doesn't mean we should ""let things be"" and trust mother nature. Some evolved behaviors are better then others in modern society, but it's really surprising how few they are compared to the mass which still apply.",1241345907

590756,comment,590151,590320,0,0,10ren,,,"It's been a while since I read the book, but what's the obvious parable? Maybe for me, it's a victim of an uncanny valley: it's neither stylized nor plausible.<p>I may not have given it a fair reading, because (personal preference) I really didn't like the book; the cyber stuff seemed more like unoriginal shiny tech than a way to provide insightful commentary on what it is to be human - unlike Tine pack minds, for example.<p>I haven't done a survey of fulltime writers; and I'm sure exceptions exist as you've noted. Larry Niven knows many more writers than I do, and so I think his observation probably has some merit. But really, I'm just expressing my frustration with Vinge's output, and noting that it coincides precisely with his retirement. I miss his old stuff.",1241345601

There are probably more lines of code to handle indentation in emacs than in all of notepad.<p>Fwiw, since '98, notepad gained keyboard shortcuts and calculator had its backend rewritten to handle higher precision decimals. Both are simple utilities for simple tasks.<p>And you know what? The best calculator in the world, it has physical buttons. Or, it is Mathematica. Answering which is best depends completley on the question, and totally misses the point.",1241345447

So for them to rely on spatial metaphors or visualisations could be downright destructive to their thinking. And I believe the same holds for much of the logic we create in software.",1241344820

369544,comment,369111,369510,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Here's a working definition for you: the construction of interlinked models that are proven/disproven by repeatable independent experiments. Science is tentative and falsifiable. The normal day-to-day scientist usually deals with somewhat boring measurements and experiments inside of a <i>paradigm</i>. Every now and then the paradigm is shown to be broken and a new paradigm takes its place.<p>Usually to call something ""not science"" is to say it is not based on 1) testable, falsifiable hypothesis, 2) accurate data, or 3) an inability to replicate/verify",1227110222

There's no way the general public will read dry academic papers, no matter how scientifically valid they are.

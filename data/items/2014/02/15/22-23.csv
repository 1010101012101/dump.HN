7245838,comment,7242468,7242468,1,0,richsin,,,"Why only one? I would share whatever I knew.<p>1. Start to develop a work/life balance. No one can tell you how many hours you should be working or what to do on your downtime. This is just the beginning - you CAN prevent burn out.<p>2. Start to network, find other entrepreneurs and listen to them. One day you will need someone to listen to you. Not all advice is actionable, but it&#x27;s crucial to get multiple perspectives so you can play it out in your head. Eventually you will have enough plays in your head to tackle most, if not all problems.<p>3. Get your product or your voice out there. You need some validation of your ideas and thoughts. I tell you this because I wish I did this earlier.<p>4. Most of the best advice you will ever receive will be the regrets of others.<p>5. Capital is to an entrepreneur as a job is to an employee. Idea&#x27;s are worthless if you cannot execute them. Cost to open a business is at an all time low. Low is not free.<p>6. Don&#x27;t fail broke. Know when to cut your losses. I have learned that most people don&#x27;t cut their losses because they are guilty that they have not done enough to give their business the best shot possible. On the flip side, if you are putting your all and you still 100% believe in your product, you need to get that passion and drive in front of investors to buy yourself as much time as possible. These have been the best times of my life, win or lose, never regretted a moment.<p>7. Don&#x27;t ever stop yourself from doing whatever it takes to be successful. At my current startup, I am in the field everyday (I am building a marketplace), answering calls and doing physical work that is far below my pay grade. Why? Because at this point of the business I am far better off doing what I am doing now and to grow accordingly. Don&#x27;t build an illusion of success by having office space, hiring people to do things that you can do yourself at first and creating the impression that things are happening. Let it come naturally.<p>8. Finally, Learn to build a life without regrets. There is are no hard and fast rules. You will regret shit, fix it immediately. Move on.",1392505010

But a typical line of python does a lot more than a typical line of C.  So things you can do with a &quot;loose&quot; loop (like once per 64k block) is usually ok in python.

7245835,comment,7245203,7245778,2,0,to3m,,,"VAT is a bit tiresome. Some goods are non-VATable, some are 0% rated, and there is also a 5% rate for certain types of fuel. You have a couple of options for how you deal with VAT, with one option allowing you to count any VAT on outgoings against the VAT payable - and there&#x27;s a certain amount of record-keeping required if you want to take advantage of that.<p>But I know one person who has done his own accounts (small company, 3 people I think, accounts included VAT and payroll) and he didn&#x27;t seem to think it was too bothersome. The documentation provided by the UK tax authorities is actually generally pretty good. But the punchline to his story was that when he eventually hired an accountant, mainly to save time, it turned out he&#x27;d missed a number of opportunities to take advantage of this or that way of reducing tax payments. So it seems like the DIY approach might not get you in hot water, but a lack of relevant training and experience could still prove costly.<p>Based on this story I signed up for an accountant from day 1 ;)",1392504968

A pseudoscientist may elect to discard reality instead.<p>> Because the common cold has a non-zero mortality rate, you can&#x27;t say that your cure always works.<p>Yes, and on that basis I can claim that my idea is falsifiable.

Some people get paid huge amounts of money not merely because of what they do, but because of who they are and manipulation of social power structures.  Queens, kings, heirs, priests....CEO&#x27;s?<p>We know that there have been relatively wealthy individuals throughout all of history, and we can also probably ascertain that many people would think that some actions should be socially more deserving of social remuneration/reward than others.  There are rich people who are rich because of being rewarded due to doing great things for lots of others, and there are rich people who are rich because of nothing they did for the rest of society but because of current social structure or through random chance or through false beliefs and manipulation of those who sent money and social power their way, and there are rich people who are rich because they&#x27;ve done some pretty nasty shit.  Some have probably done all three.<p>So which are the CEO&#x27;s (if we must talk of them collectively)?  Well, I would say to Mr Mankiw that if the easiest answer is that CEO&#x27;s make millions because of merit, then their merit should be easy enough to measure.  Because if its not easy enough to measure, then on what basis could the boards possibly be connecting merit to pay?  They couldn&#x27;t be.  Perhaps it is merely a cargo cult or back scratching operation relative to the amounts of capital they have available to them?  As I said, there&#x27;s lots of classes that have received money through the social mechanisms that the general populace has accepted, but just because the pope sits on a throne of gold, doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s actually communing with god or deserving of it.<p>Indeed, perhaps we could answer this empirically.  We can take CEO pay of various public companies, and control against regular share-market index movements.  Define a function to relate company size to CEO remuneration, and then define a function to relate this to company worth over time after that CEO has been hired.  It should become pretty apparent, pretty quickly, that those that paid more for a CEO at a particular time had particularly better outcomes after paying high prices for said CEO after he came on board, on average, than those that paid less.  If they didn&#x27;t, then its pretty clear that of all the reasons people are getting paid so much money, relative merit isn&#x27;t one of them and perhaps we need to look for other explanatory variables.<p>So out of curiosity...anyone on HN aware of any such studies?<p>/and by all means Mr Mankiw, people in your position bringing out the &quot;but the rich pay more in taxes!&quot; just reinforces my impression that harvard and higher education institutions are a complete sham.",1392502978

Therefore, everything we know complies with mathematics--it&#x27;s not some Platonic form outside us or our creation, but the very structure of our understanding.

Unlike chess players, it does not seems that the outcome of their game affect CEO reputation or income - it&#x27;s a gentleman club where socializing matters more than performance.",1392501827

For years I heard things like: grow up, grow a pair, get used to it, you just need to toughen up, and so on.<p>In my early teen years I ran long distance track but never felt well during or after a meet. I had to stop.<p>Fast forward to my late 30s and I get diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (obstructive) [1]. It&#x27;s genetic (I&#x27;ve been tested).  At this point, even mild exercise over a period of time (a week or so) leads to congestive heart failure (CHF). I have little doubt I was suffering from lighter symptoms as far back as childhood.<p>There are some people who cannot exercise. I so want to do something to help ease stress. For me, however, exercise == stress. If I lifted weights two days a week and ran for three, I&#x27;d end up in the hospital. As it is, I can walk a few times a week for about 30 minutes.<p>There are zebras in the world. People should be careful about taking advice from discussion boards. See your doctor before starting any serious exercise program.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy</a>",1392501764

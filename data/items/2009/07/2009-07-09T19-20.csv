696554,comment,695947,695947,0,0,weegee,,,"while a senior in high school myself and my friends took LSD and while it was certainly not lab-grade acid, just street acid, it was a fascinating experience. We repeated it a couple times more and by the end of the third trip, I felt that there was nothing more to learn from it so I stopped. They kept on for a few more years. I read as many books as I could get my hands on from the library, including a fascinating book called ""Acid Dreams"" which told how LSD was used by the CIA for research into a possible truth serum. While I would not recommend LSD to anyone for recreational purposes now, it is important that we can learn more about how the brain works by having the chance to use LSD as a learning tool. I think it can be used to help people with various disorders, if used by a qualified physician/counselor and in a good safe environment. Cary Grant was an LSD user and he felt it helped him a great deal late in his life.",1247169350

Far too often you have to pay 100+ for a piece of plastic or metal of a certain shape. The moment the price for such parts gets under 100-200, you will actually be able to re-build your car radiator in the service cheaper then ordering it from the producer.

My point is that you might reasonably want to extend the concept of destructuring further to cover dictionaries, and that macros allow you to extend the language in that way.<p>Clarity, readability, and comprehensibility are three words that, in programming, mean pretty much the same thing as familiarity.  To me, if I weren't looking at the definition of unpack, the above would look weird because I'd think of the Perl function unpack(), which does something very different.  unpack(d, keys) above isn't something you'd even write in Clojure because it would be a synonym for (map d keys).  Aside from that, it does seem very straightforward, if limited.  Clojure does win on generality, because the Clojure version nests, covering sequential data structures at the same time:<p><pre><code>   user=> (def d {:a {:a1 [1 2 3] :a2 4} :b 5})
   #'user/d
   user=> (let [{{[_ _ x] :a1} :a, y :b}  d]

Google today mostly needs to fend off outside monopolists who would aim to seize the whole thing by taking control of one or another choke-points. And having <i>an</i> OS to challenge MS is important here - even if the OS only takes minority share, keeping MS honest is important. Moreover, if all those other companies don't make monopoly profits, they won't have extra cash to throw at Google.<p>To get to a Google prompt, a user needs:
1) A PC
2) An operating system
3) A web browser
4) An Internet Connection from an ISP<p>The OS can potentially control search engine choice. Ditto with the browser and the ISP. Notice that Google has challenged monopolistic behavior in steps 2-4 by now (wireless venture, Chrome, Chrome OS). PC architecture is already mostly open so Google doesn't have to do anything there - but Google <i>does</i> build PCs!",1247167058

I started the blog for fun, and only after a couple years had become good at it and built up enough readership to turn it into a successful advertising vehicle. Had I set out on that path from the beginning I surely would have given up.",1231217811

Given that these scores are used for comparison so often, you'd think they would normalize the scores so that a 700 means the same thing on both sections.<p>For what it's worth, this is a trend on other standardized tests as well (including the SAT).",1231216920

If your site is awesome (like GitHub), peopel will pay for it, even students.  The bigger problem (for us at least) was not lack of funding, but lack of a funding <i>method</i>.

421590,comment,421097,421576,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Yeah that's likely the issue. Actually, looking at all the root CA certs on my computer (OS X, look in Keychain.app if you're curious) every single one of them (except one) expires in 2037 or earlier.<p>This is almost certainly not a coincidence. In software that doesn't take the Y2K38 issue into account the expiration date would wrap around to an earlier date, causing the software to think the cert is invalid.",1231216449
421588,comment,420868,420868,0,0,moonpolysoft,,,"I've been working a lot on the performance aspects of Dynomite and I think it is a better solution now than memcachedb.  One big issue with memcachedb is that it leaves replication management completely to the user.  So if you want to be able to seamlessly handle machine failure with a high traffic site, you need to do a lot of work to set up replicas, do clever things with DNS, and even then you won't get a guarantee of availability for that data.  Dynomite handles all of that transparently, plus it isn't tied to a single storage engine.  So that you can use a different storage engine based on the type of load you plan on generating.<p>The code is here: <a href=""http://github.com/cliffmoon/dynomite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/cliffmoon/dynomite</a>",1231216045

They are old. They are opinionated. They should be looking at retirement with pensions by now. They don't fit with any team I have been on.

421583,comment,421542,421542,0,0,sarvesh,,,"""Friedman's claim that monetary policy could have prevented the Great Depression was an attempt to refute the analysis of John Maynard Keynes, who argued that monetary policy is ineffective under depression conditions and that fiscal policy - large-scale deficit spending by the government - is needed to fight mass unemployment. The failure of monetary policy in the current crisis shows that Keynes had it right the first time. And Keynesian thinking lies behind Obama's plans to rescue the economy."" -- From the article<p>Just because Keynes wasn't proven wrong doesn't mean he is right. I don't think he has put enough thought into this. The fact of the matter is our financial system pretended there was whole lot more wealth than there really was and not mention the fact they continued to trade based on that.<p>Niether trickling down money top down nor spending can solve this core issue in my opinion.",1231215509

421571,comment,421373,421548,0,0,dissenter,,,"Funny, I heard a rumor that the only people who got 800s on the verbal section were foreigners. (Read: people who can't speak English.) The explanation was that they were the only ones willing to invest enough time to form-fit the ETS's method of verbal testing.<p>In my own experience the verbal section of the GRE was entirely nonsensical. The vocabulary was difficult and exactly the type of vocabulary I would use if it was my goal not to be understood, but at least I could see how it might be a useful and reliable differentiator.<p>Nobody uses these words often enough for them have any statistically meaningful shades of meaning. If the goal of communication is having other people understand you, why would you deal in words that are notable precisely because they are difficult to understand?<p>The reading comprehension made less sense. I don't think it's possible to select a passage that has an unambiguous meaning and yet will be misunderstood by a statistically meaningful number of ambitious, college-educated people. So the question-making process must necessarily be corrupt.<p>I recall many questions which wasted much of my time. Several possible responses, none of which are obviously wrong. I know which one I feel is right---or maybe I do. Which one does the GRE feel is right? Even on sample tests, where I could see the supposed answer, I would read and reread the passages, and understand little about what the correctness or incorrectness of the responses had to do with the meaning of the passage.<p>I don't think you can presume to have an objective and clear-cut A or B answer as you might on the SAT. The granularity of college-level material is simply too fine. The only thing you can measure is how well you have matched yourself to the GRE's way of thinking, and that is not a particularly valuable expenditure of time.",1231214435

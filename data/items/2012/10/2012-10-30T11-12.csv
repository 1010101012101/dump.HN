';' separates clauses - in functions, 'case', 'if' and 'receive' alike. ',' separates expressions - everywhere. And '.' ends definitions. I find this consistent, but - this being syntax - it's purely subjective, so it's not like I'm disagreeing with you - I just like it the way it is.<p>It's not Smalltalk with it's six (IIRC) syntax constructs nor is it Lisp, but compared to the syntax of C++ or other rather baroque syntaxes it is simple :)",1351598371

Thank you for the links, I didn't know that it had a name, mine were just mere observation.<p>To me it stand to logic that different hardware has different capabilities, and if an implementation can use these characteristics then the implementation can have a different O. But my point still remains that as a theorical concept, the O does not depends of the hardware in the sense that it is not a necessary piece of information to make the calculation of O.<p>Also i would like to point that in my original definition the math paint has a purpose of utility for society. To build magic hardware would be like telling Picasso here is infinite canvas and infinite degree of colors, what can you do with them? The magic is not in the resources or the tools, the magic is in thinking independent of those tools, and then using the tools to implement. I understand that people might come from the other end of the spectrum and think that we need to begin with the tools, i just don't share that view, and it has worked for me just fine.",1351598219

I assume the goal is to teach that person how to notice a situation in real life, and use the knowledge learned at school to cope with that situation.<p>Does rote learning actually help for such a goal?<p>I argue that it _might_, but only if the situation ""looks"" similar to one of the pre-prepared situations that the student has studied.<p>Those who have grasped the concept, and is able to gain deep understanding of fundamental principles, will be much better prepared for that eventual situation mentioned above. And if i was an employer, I'd want to hire that person, instead of the one who learnt by rote.<p>Now, granted, there isn't really an easy way to distinguish between the two above. Which is why the standard test is used - its the best we've got. But if the teaching method is allowed to be influenced by these standarized tests such that the student, instead of gaining a deep understanding, is relegated to just rote learning, he/she will never really be able to apply what they've learnt to situations they've never encountered before, and thus, the goal is not fullfilled.",1351598079

My apologies.<p>I agree though, Apple's price discrimination may be understandable but as a customer it can really grind sometimes. When I went for an iPad I decided on the 16GB model for cost reasons and regretted it ever since, but the price jump to the 32GB was big enough that I shied away from it. It was annoying that the premium for a component that cost a fraction of what they charged created an uncomfortable dilemma for me that as a customer I shouldn't really have faced.<p>In all I'm excited about the level of competition, with MS's Surface bringing in another interesting angle, and I hope it continues for a long time.

If there's some way to make that work, that would be cool.<p>It's a fun experience, congratulations.",1183315432

If she's doing operations, meeting numbers, all that stuff, that should make Wall Street happier.<p>But Jerry's in the hot seat here.  He's got to find the right things to focus on for the future, in a company that does a lot of stuff already.<p>By the way, here in LA there's already some wringing of hands in the business press about how the Santa Monica office may be losing some of its movie-producer types and their projects now that Semel's out.  Not sure it will happen, but it doesn't sound tragic to me.",1183315033

I bet there's a 16-year-old with twice Casnochas' net worth and a much more insightful view of business -- who can't brag about it because his business is selling drugs.",1183313732

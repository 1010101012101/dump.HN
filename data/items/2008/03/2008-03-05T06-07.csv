129517,story,,,30,54,simianstyle,"Ask YC: Should I quit programming to pursue the arts?",,"I'm currently a student in Boston who is about to graduate from a business school, however i'm a self-taught programmer. I've taken a job as a developer for a start-up in Waltham after college, and it's a really good gig, but i don't think i'm going to be happy in the long run and here's why:<p>Last week i was at the Blue Man Group show, and a thought came to me that these guys on stage were probably making about as much as I will once I graduate, but (to me) they're having so much fun doing it (throwing paint around, making people laugh, and whatnot). Then it occurred to me that since i've been going to business school and programming, i've practically lost all touch with my artistic side (I used to paint, draw, act, etc..) and that I really regret it.<p>I've come to the conclusion that i don't want to spend the rest of my life in front of a computer and what will make really happy will be to pursue my passion in arts and entertainment. However i don't want to give up my bread and butter (programming) because I consider myself to be decent at it and it will pay the rent.<p>Is there some way I can have my cake and eat it too? And if i do, how do i break the news to my parents? (they are super conservative and expected me to become a doctor, lawyer, or something along those veins).<p>PG how did you manage to fit it all in your life without losing grasp of either one?",1204699088

I also don't understand why more professionals don't work a 4 day block during the weekend.<p>How much more business can you get when your clients have time off on the weekend to visit you for taxes, lawyering, medical checkups, dentistry, or banking or more important for the DMV or court? Why do they insist I take off a work day or speed through congested traffic to make it to their office by 5? Why does everyone love to wait 5 days just so they can cram together at the mall or in the same restaurant?<p>Why go through the congested highways because EVERYONE is working at the same time?<p>Why?

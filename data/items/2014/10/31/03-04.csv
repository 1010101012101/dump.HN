When it was connected my internet was seeing slowdowns every 30 seconds, completely destroying a hangout I was trying to have at the time.<p>If I didn&#x27;t have an HTPC in front of my NAS, I would probably connect it again. But I don&#x27;t need or want any of the network features. The apps are stupid. Browsing with the crappy remote is an exercise in extreme frustration. And I hardly ever watch youtube from my couch, so &quot;throwing&quot; content to the TV is pointless for me.<p>I can understand why some people would really like some of the &quot;smart&quot; tv features, but all my other devices that I connect to the tv have enough smarts in them anyway.

I&#x27;m not talking about female infanticide and foeticide(This kind of things do happen, even now). But, These days those couples who have the morality of not committing such inhumane acts don&#x27;t even bother to have a second kid if the first kid is a girl. While I see couples who have boy as a first kid generally go in for a second kid.<p>This is creating a massive irreparable gender imbalance in the society. Only this time, no one is breaking any law or committing any unethical or immoral activity. They are merely exercising their freedom to not bear children.<p>For a country where people have so much hate towards same gender marriages, every parent aspiring to have only boys is sort of straight hypocritical.",1414727870

The update adds a ton of features and improves the UI quite a bit ;)<p>To respond to some of your ideas feedback:<p>* I do plan to sell the service by some combination of charging to buy the native version and a monthly/yearly fee for the cloud version.<p>* By offering the native version I hope to assuage any privacy or legacy concerns -- all you data is on your machine (encrypted and backed up however you see fit). You&#x27;ll even have access to a local API to extract or do whatever you want with it.<p>* One idea I&#x27;ve had is to offer a cloud version / native version combo. You would sync to the cloud only your bookmarked sites -- all the other indexed pages you visit would stay on the local version. This way you control what gets put up on the servers but can still have access to your links from all your devices. Thoughts?<p>* I&#x27;d also consider open sourcing it (it&#x27;s built on Meteor and ElasticSearch) but really do need to get paid for my efforts (just had a baby) and am not familiar with all the ins/outs of open source based businesses. I&#x27;d love to hear ideas and advice!<p>* This has turned out to be quite a lot more difficult than I&#x27;d thought but I&#x27;m real happy with how things are coming along.

Any plans to add an &quot;invest&quot; feature like just-dice had?<p>Edit: Example of how &quot;invest&quot; worked on that site: &quot;You can invest some of your balance with the site for other players to bet against. This both increases the maximum bets on the site, and you keep any profits made. You also &#x27;keep&#x27; any losses...Let&#x27;s break it down: Suppose the total bankroll is currently made of 90 BTC from a single investor, and you invest a further 10 BTC. You will have 10% of the new &#x27;current bankroll&#x27;, and the first investor&#x27;s share will drop from 100% to 90%. Each bet that a player makes is played against the current bankroll. As players win and lose, your investment grows or shrinks by 10% of the overall house profit. When you withdraw your investment you get 10% of the current bankroll. You may withdraw your investment at any time. Other players&#x27; investments will affect the percentage of the current bankroll that your investment represents. If a 3rd investor then invests another 100 BTC, bringing the total bankroll to 200 BTC, the first investor&#x27;s percentage drop from 90% to 45%, your percentage drops from 10% to 5%, and the new investor&#x27;s percentage is 50%. Then if a player loses 20 BTC to the site, everyone&#x27;s investment grows in proportion. Your 10 BTC investment is now 5% of the new bankroll (220 BTC) ie. 11 BTC...The site currently charges a 10% commission on net investment profits...Commission is charged when profits are divested, or at midnight (UTC) on Sunday each week, whichever happens sooner&quot;",1414725063

Scott McNealy used to congratulate people getting promoted with &quot;One step up, one step closer to the door.&quot; That captured the balancing act between climbing the ladder versus being pushed off of it because someone else wanted your spot. I think Andy will be much happier in his new role, and it isn&#x27;t like he has to work for a living any more :-)",1414724991

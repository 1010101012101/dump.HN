You said, &quot;...the surveillance programs are not evil either.&quot; Also, you said &quot;...the primary goal of these programs is to save lives.&quot; - which <i>does</i> indicate a judgement since &quot;saving lives&quot; is empirically a good thing...even though you really don&#x27;t know the true purpose, only what you&#x27;ve been told.<p><i>Second, I point out the &quot;primary&quot; goal is to save lives, but I make no mention of additional goals or side effects</i><p>You don&#x27;t know that. You have been told that, but you don&#x27;t know it.<p><i>...what is &quot;often so conveniently implied&quot; since I never implied any such thing.</i><p>Yes, you did. You said (apparently speaking to the entire forum) that, &quot;Regardless of the cynicism you bring to the topic, the primary goal of these programs is to save lives.&quot; - as if that nugget of &quot;knowledge&quot; about the alleged purpose of those programs should override any cynicism...implying that the general cynicism here is not already grounded in knowledge.<p>Actions speak louder than words.

5942732,comment,5941571,5942307,1,0,baddox,,,"When government has the ability to regulate certain industries, that ability <i>will</i> be utilized by participants of those industries for their own benefit, unless there is a process in place which prevents that. I suspect such a process to be impossible, but that&#x27;s a separate argument. What&#x27;s clear is that the process currently does not exist. Thus the distinction between government action that is truly &quot;for the people&quot; and government action was &quot;serves special interests&quot; is mostly nonexistent. There can certainly be overlap, but at the end of the day <i>all</i> government action will be sold as being for the people simply because of the supposedly representative nature of our government (essentially, the government&#x27;s argument is <i>&quot;you occasionally get to vote, and you haven&#x27;t overthrown us yet, therefore all of our actions are justified and are in your best interest, and by the way, if you try to overthrow or even disobey us we will kill you and use this same argument to justify that&quot;</i>).<p>I don&#x27;t think of &quot;special interests&quot; as something conspiratorial or even surprising, but rather obvious and inevitable.

<i>but I choose not to take the easy way out by demonizing the NSA or portraying these programs as an Orwellian nightmare.</i>
---<p>Fair enough, but then why take the easy way out of the discussion, and instead of addressing individual posts guilty of the above in your opinion directly, but just fire that salvo into the room? Okay, you&#x27;re free to do that, to summarize and save yourself time, but at least know that I read a lot of (&quot;you&#x27;re <i>all</i> wrong because of strawman strawman&quot;) in the last weeks on HN, and reacted more polemic to your post than maybe was called for. Apologies for that.<p>But still, I disagree. &quot;Orwellian&quot; to me is about language and the resulting inability to reason, not telescreens and 5 minutes of hate.<p>We live on a planet were Saddam was attacked in the windfall of 9/11, while huge chunk of the American people believed he had something to do with it. It&#x27;s not like administration said &quot;hey, we need this war, but we don&#x27;t want you to support it for false reasons, Saddam was NOT involved in 9/11, he&#x27;s just this super epic dictator and weapons wiz&quot;. That would still have been bullshit deserving of a hanging &quot;if the Nuremberg laws were applied&quot;, but it would have been a nice gesture.<p>But no. They used it passively. Result of the whole exercise, so far that is? More dead people than the whole history of terrorism against the US several times over. While talking about democracy, posing on an aircraft carrier, all that stuff.<p>Not that I can blame the NSA for that, I don&#x27;t. But there is no Orwellian institution in an otherwise sane society, it&#x27;s all connected. The NSA is just one aspect of it, not even a very interesting one IMHO. But hey, you do recall &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot;, and how they scrambled to change the name when they realized they were too honest, right? So the NSA certainly does Orwellian in-house, too. But even when they don&#x27;t, they <i>are</i> a tool in the toolbox of an Orwellian state. The only way to deny that would be to say they are actually independant of it, which would be a problem also. So there you go..<p>Even when I say NSA, I don&#x27;t mean to exclude anyone else. In Germany the Verfassungsschutz (literally &quot;constitution protection&quot;) is basically the sole reason the NPD (neonazi party) can&#x27;t be dealt with, because it and the neonazi scene is so filled with undercover operatives. That got so bad that the cops in Sachsen-Anhalt, to be able to raid them without forewarning, decided to not inform the Verfassungsschutz anymore ( German, but at least it&#x27;s source: <a href=""http://www.taz.de/!103340/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taz.de/!103340/</a> ). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s strictly Orwellian, but it&#x27;s fucking crazy, and fucking evil. Well-meant, banal evil; the kind that actually really matters, the <i>big</i> killer. Suicide bombers and killing sprees are horrible, flying planes into a building I still haven&#x27;t fully wrapped my head around -- but all that still vanishes compared to the killings committed in total by perfectly calm, perfectly well-meaning people, operating strictly within the law.<p>---
<i>Second, I point out the &quot;primary&quot; goal is to save lives, </i>
---<p>Which in turn implies benevolence. Instead of how centers of power act, in self-interest. How many people are killed by international terrorism -- I mean the kind the NSA idly watches because it&#x27;s the US doing it? And how many such deaths does the NSA credibly avert? Finally, how many people could be clothed, fed and sheltered by 1% the budget of the NSA? I mean, if saving lifes is really the &quot;primary&quot; (why in quotes?) goal, why not at least A/B test a little?<p>---
<i>If you can criticize the bad without losing sight of the good, you can find progress.</i>
---<p>Yes, but I also find backlashes to progress. Consider the 60s and the backlash to that. I see that were people were robbed and killed in the past, they&#x27;re now simply left behind in the ever faster growing gap between the super rich and the rest. I see much energy with those who fear and are greedy, and much aimlessness or premature celebration of those who love. I see the threshold for how many people you need to fool or blackmail or have on your side for complete, endless control sink rapidly as technology progresses, too.<p>But still, I didn&#x27;t loose sight of the good. I make sure to look at clouds and smile at dogs <i>every day</i>. I&#x27;ve met nice cops, I&#x27;ve seen brutal ones, I know bureaucrats who are just a little slow, but friendly, and those who harbour resentment towards anyone not as bald or fat as they. And <i>especially</i> that I would say quite a bunch of those, and soldiers too, have... serious issues... makes me feel for those who are their fellows who are decent people.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and even if none of my post is about &quot;the good stuff&quot;, and disagrees with you on many points, you can believe me that I hear you on this, and agree. Sometimes I say it myself, but sometimes I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helpful. Imagine there is a burning house, we need help putting out the fire, and some guy says &quot;but consider all those houses that are NOT burning&quot;. Even if it&#x27;s well meant it can be irritating.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in collective punishment or blame, but I DO believe in those who are not meant getting out of the way instead of shielding those I&#x27;m trying to get at, or are being used by third parties as a shield even. I mean, if they can live with collateral damage meaning people being murdered utterly dead, they can live with me mistakenly considering someone a mediocre cog in a crappy machine, one would think.<p>Not even anyone I consider a &quot;perpetrator&quot; I really wish evil on, I don&#x27;t care for punishment as much as about self-defense. But you can&#x27;t forgive the attacker until you stopped the attack, because that would be just bending over. So ideally, quite a bunch of people really ought to be lead right up to the guillotine and <i>then</i> forgiven. I see no other way that is not a farce and pissing on graves.<p>But when it comes to &quot;just&quot; words: human history might go on for a looong time, and anyone who could take offense, no matter how bad they feel about it, will be long dead when the principles of power and rationalization will still be the same. Just read the old testament, this stuff is old as dirt. As long as there is recorded history, the world has been Orwellian as far as I can tell. I&#x27;m not so naive to think I will see the end of it, but I&#x27;ll throw my weight into the scale regardless. I&#x27;m calling it, and screw anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it because it applies to their little parcel of the world as well.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if my post is so long and incoherent, and also if it seems unfriendly or is full of typos, but I&#x27;ve been awake for a full 29 hours, and I&#x27;m beginning to feel it. Maybe I should have posted tomorrow but here goes. Don&#x27;t take it to personally where I do you wrong, I don&#x27;t know you.",1372197263

The propaganda at that time included commercials picturing these camps to the German public as being camps were Jews are used for the betterment of German society, while living in humane conditions, unworthy of the rodents they were considered to be.<p>This whole thing started and evolved in small steps. Auschwitz happened after they realised that deporting them is not feasible, due to the process taking too long due to other countries being reluctant to open their borders to such a big minority and killing them in bulk by gas was cheaper than using bullets.<p>If anything the German public probably viewed murders and awkward things happening in plain sight as being acts taken for security reasons against disobeying Jews or against Jews that refuse to leave their society.<p>Eventually the German public must have been aware of the genocide, but you also have to consider that (1) they could have been too frightened of the monster they created, with problematic individuals being in jeopardy of being classified as Jews or Jew-lovers and (2) as a species, we tend to not recognize our mistakes after enough sacrifices have been made, so it&#x27;s easier to think that you are part of a revolution for the good of human kind, then it is to think of yourself as a freaking murderer that believed the words of maniacs.",1372196619

When it comes to property rights, obviously there are many varying philosophies and codes that people adhere to, but most people who believe in any form of personal property rights believe that the owners themselves can legitimately use force to defend that property. In other words, there is no <i>monopoly</i> on the legitimate use of force for enforcing property rights.<p>Government, on the other hand, enjoys a monopoly on the legitimate use of force for many things. If a random group of people went around to every house in a region forcefully taking money in order to fund roads, hospitals, charities, etc., the vast majority of society would not see this as legitimate. Likewise, if 9 of the 10 families on your block agreed to forcefully take and use your family&#x27;s house and property as they saw fit, the vast majority of society would not see this as legitimate. The fact that the majority of people in a region agreed on the use of force would not legitimize it. So government is unique in this regard: it can and does do both of those things and more, and society sees them as the only group of people who can legitimately do that.

As more people use the web&#x27;s many services and as businesses build better websites, Google will make more money because of all of the search and display ads people will undoubtedly see and/or click. Almost every Google product and service has been around encouraging consumer use of the web, or fostering growth of web businesses.<p>This tool is just an extension of how Google Analytics fits into their strategy: by making website owners smarter, they will be more willing to build better websites and spend ad dollars driving traffic. If you have no idea what your website is doing, you have no incentive to acquire traffic. Make a better website, grow your visits? Google still profits. This explains why GA is free -- you can better measure the ROI of your ad spend and will likely spend even more.",1372195439

It&#x27;s premise was a free, frictionless, focused Q&A site and it was made possible by the wide audiences of Atwood and Spolsky. Atwood focused more on something that went between obscene OCD and just dogma. I think what wasn&#x27;t realized after the beginning of SO was that SO became a success despite Atwood&#x27;s ideology, not because of it. I think Joel realized it, just based on the podcasts, but since Atwood was doing most of the work, &quot;whatever.&quot; The big problem came in with the ideology becoming enmeshed with the culture and the high council of Meta being sort of a sycophantic keeper of the faith. Basically, any question or answer or anything that might, some day, remotely look like a &quot;discussion&quot; (gasp) on SO is rigidly stamped out by the religious police. You could say this is hyperbole, but just use it for awhile.

5942456,comment,5941646,5941646,16,0,bane,,,"Fun definition: the definition of a good wine is the wine you like to drink.<p>Real definition: the difference between good wines and bad wines is the complexity of the flavor. Crap wines usually have a very narrow and uncomplicated flavor profile, wines that are more likely to be enjoyed have more complex profiles. What makes it confusing is that different kinds of wines have radically different flavor profiles: a Pinot Noir has a &quot;lighter flavor&quot; than a Cabernet Sauvignon. The $2 a gallon wines at the local gas station are unlikely to have a complex flavor profile, and that&#x27;s why people call them &quot;crap&quot;.<p>Also, contrary to popular belief, wine blends aren&#x27;t necessarily a sign of a bad wine, due to local soil conditions (which provide different nutrient ratios and can change the flavor profile quite a bit) some varieties of grapes grow fine, but don&#x27;t produce the desired complex flavor profile. Vintners blends wines from several sources like a recipe to &quot;build up&quot; the flavor profile they wish for.<p>To learn to drink wine, simply try lots of them, try them by themselves and with different foods. Some are better paired with certain foods (the food diminishes or accents certain parts of the wine&#x27;s flavor), or by themselves. Don&#x27;t spend lots of money on wine, the &quot;sweet&quot; spot to me for good wines tends to be between $7-$14 per 750ml at the store (the exact same wines will be about 3x that at a restaurant). Costco seems to be about the cheapest place to buy good wines, a $10 wine there is consistently $12-15 elsewhere. If you go to a winery, expect to pay around $20-30 for a bottle. Find what you like and TADA! You&#x27;ve found a good wine.<p>There are essentially two kinds of wineries, ones that grow their own grapes, and ones that buy grapes from other farms and ferment the wine themselves. Most wineries will also buy wines from other local wineries for their blends. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it and it&#x27;s just how winemaking works.<p>Wine drinking is an acquired taste, many wines might be harsh or unpleasant on first sip, and by the bottom of the glass sublime. The taste might change a bit as you work your way through a bottle. When you read that wine has &quot;hints of spice and plums&quot; or whatever, it&#x27;s just a way of describing the profile to you and what you might be able to expect. &quot;Plum&quot; might describe a deep fruity flavor (not sweet), &quot;tobacco&quot; describes some of the bitter tannins that come from the skins.<p>Wines also change flavor as they sit in storage. Some wines don&#x27;t develop their full flavor profile until a couple years after they&#x27;re bottled. Some wines are intended to be enjoyed almost immediately (Nouveaus).<p>Try wines from different places, the normal French styles are popular, but there are some incredibly good local varieties that aren&#x27;t well known outside of their home countries (and are usually very cheap). Spain and Italy in particular have a rich and complex wine culture easily as great as France. Many popular varieties are also grown in places outside of France. California for example grows lots of traditional French varieties. Areas not necessarily known for good wine might actually mean that they don&#x27;t have the right kind of soil or climate to grow these popular varieties. Virginia, for example, is too wet to grow really good Cabernets, but there are almost entirely unknown grapes bred just for Virginia that are excellent.<p>Wine glasses are intended for your nose rather than your tongue. They&#x27;re designed as recognition that about half of our flavor comes from our noses, so different shapes of the glass are intended to help deliver vaporizing parts of the wine to your nose to help build up the flavor profile.<p>Wine drinking is not snobby, in places with a very long wine drinking history, wine is the normal table drink. It&#x27;s nothing unusual to sit down in a reasonably priced family restaurant, order a plate of the local whatever and get a 500ml carafe of house wine as part of the order instead of water. It probably won&#x27;t be great wine (might even be cut with a bit of water), but it&#x27;ll go fine with the meal. In history, wine was the &quot;safe&quot; alternative to water, priests, construction workers, delivery men, soldiers, etc. all drank wine as part of their normal day-to-day.<p>Think nothing of sitting outside on your porch with a bottle of Merlot and a red plastic solo cup if you enjoy it.<p>A few of my personal favorites (all between $9-14 at Costco):<p><a href=""http://www.wine.com/v6/Penfolds-Koonunga-Hill-Shiraz-Cabernet-2010/wine/114071/detail.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wine.com/v6/Penfolds-Koonunga-Hill-Shiraz-Caberne...</a><p><a href=""http://www.wine.com/v6/Santa-Rita-Reserva-Cabernet-Sauvignon-2009/wine/115793/detail.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wine.com/v6/Santa-Rita-Reserva-Cabernet-Sauvignon...</a><p><a href=""http://www.winesu.com/zaccagnini-montepulciano.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.winesu.com/zaccagnini-montepulciano.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.wine.com/v6/Excelsior-Cabernet-Sauvignon-2010/wine/115179/detail.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wine.com/v6/Excelsior-Cabernet-Sauvignon-2010/win...</a> (about $6 at Costco with a twist off top!)",1372194375

It just doesn&#x27;t look that way to me. Instead, it looks like a small problem that has tremendous resources devoted to it for no good reason.<p>Consider the following facts:<p>1. Terrorist attacks are pretty easy to carry out. Any motivated HNer could easily plan and execute an attack, on a programmer&#x27;s salary, that would outshine the Boston bombings.

Despite #1 and #2, terrorist attacks remain extremely rare.<p>The only conclusion I can draw from this is that there are <i>very</i> few people who are actually motivated to carry out attacks. It&#x27;s nothing to do with enforcement, it&#x27;s simply that most people don&#x27;t actually want to go out and kill a bunch of innocents.<p>As for detecting nukes, why do you think that smuggling a warhead into the US is a technique reserved for terrorists?

It gives you, the developer, a way to package your app and all its dependencies into a portable container which can be deployed on any modern Linux server: local VM, bare metal server, EC2 instance, doesn&#x27;t matter. Containers are completely sandboxed and do not interfere with each other (think &quot;iPhone apps for the server&quot;).<p>The specificities of each machine (location, distro, storage, networking) are abstracted away so you can focus on <i>what</i> your application requires (a known filesystem state, tcp ports to receive connections...) without having to worry about <i>how</i> those requirements will be met on each individual machine. This abstraction is based on common unix concepts - files, processes, tcp connections - and is therefore not language-specific, so it doesn&#x27;t matter what programming language your application is written in.<p>To do this, Docker relies on a recent feature of the linux kernel called lxc. That&#x27;s the part which allows sandboxing of applications from one another. The concept itself is not new - what is new is that it is now part of the mainstream kernel, which means almost every server in the world will soon be capable of running docker containers - hence the exciting possibility of &quot;run anywhere&quot;.",1372194126

The existing legislation you keep bringing up doesn&#x27;t protect the costumers the way it should (and maybe, at some point, was supposed to, until it was perverted via medallion system to protect taxi business more than taxi customers).<p>Uber&#x27;s self-regulation (via comments, for both drivers and riders) is a better way to provide good service than the regulation which is routinely violated and not enforced.<p>By which I mean:
* taxi drivers routinely avoid picking up people they don&#x27;t like, who also happen to be minorities/black people. I don&#x27;t think they are allowed to do that by law but there you go: it&#x27;s impossible to enforce that law so it isn&#x27;t. In Uber, a given client can be banned but only because it behaved badly in the past. There&#x27;s no pre-judging based on his color of the skin
* forcing cabs to service undesirable areas - you&#x27;ve got to be kidding me. I once spent an hour phoning different cab companies trying to get a cab to less populated area of SF. Extreme frustration when you call them, they say the cab will be there but isn&#x27;t and you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because they blew you off or the cab is really coming. With Uber - again, no problem. They would be stupid to to not service you and they can manage the fleet effectively to dispatch cars where there is demand. Plus, you get real-time feedback on where the car is - there is no guessing<p>Ultimately your arguments are dishonest because you present a binary choice: either Uber complies with existing taxi laws (which in most cases means their business cannot operate the way it does) or doesn&#x27;t, in which case you automatically assume that it&#x27;s unfair to taxi companies.<p>How about third option: create laws that allow both taxis and Uber, on equal footing?<p>I&#x27;m all for laws protecting the customers of Uber and customers of taxis, but as of today, it seems Uber does much better job with self-regulation than taxis with government regulation.<p>I&#x27;m all for fair competition but as of today Uber is being denied even ability to compete via government regulations lobbied for by taxi companies. We don&#x27;t have to rally to protect &quot;poor&quot; taxis that provide bad service, from Uber, which provides good service, but rally to allow Uber to compete at all.<p>Maybe when we do have competition, taxi companies will be forced to finally improve the service they provide, something that decades of legislation haven&#x27;t been able to achieve.<p>Maybe when that happens, we won&#x27;t have to have laws to <i>force</i> companies to service all of Chicago and they&#x27;ll do it because there&#x27;s demand and they will do it to profit from that demand.<p>You know, the way a free market is supposed to work and not the way it currently works when we have law to artificially restrict supply (medallions) and (ineffective) law to &quot;fix&quot; the problem created by artificially restricting supply.

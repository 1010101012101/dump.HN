9077756,comment,9077479,9077479,0,0,pbiggar,,,"I think the OP misunderstands the words &quot;billion dollar company&quot;. Which is actually completely understandable, since money is in the title you assume it&#x27;s about the money.<p>Typically founders are product people, they want to solve a problem that exists in the world. But, to solve that problem, they need to make a big impactful company, that grows to dominate a particular niche or industry and disrupt the current way of doing things.<p>To these founders, &quot;billion dollar company&quot; is a shorthand for all these ideals: to make a great and lasting company, to solve a real problem for a very large number of people, and to make a real impact in the world.<p>It&#x27;s not coincidence that this phrase is also important to VCs, for whom &quot;billion dollar company&quot; may have a different meaning, that being &quot;make back the fund for our LPs&quot;. I say &quot;may&quot; because that&#x27;s a simplistic view: many VCs are looking to make the world a better place too, and in many cases they have more money than they need already.<p>And to journalists, these mean &quot;companies which we have to pay attention to&quot;. And when you think about, they&#x27;re not paying attention because of the value, but because of the impact. Which is why journalists are always talking about consumer companies, because they have much more impact in the world than more successful enterprise companies.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t people in it for the money. But we rarely need to worry about them, since they rarely succeed.",1424386780

If someone merely wanted to build wealth there are many options with a higher expected value and higher chance of producing life-changing results.<p>The stated billion dollar goal has several reasons behind it, the least of which is money. Diving into those reasons one by one could be very interesting; it could expose and analyze our core beliefs (both noble and less-so). Instead the author wasted the chance to do that and left us with something both simplistic and wrong.",1424386778

The &#x27;paper&#x27; - whatever it&#x27;s made of - has texture, and the way the ink sinks into it has depth and texture too.<p>>Likewise with traditional printing. The sequence of pages creates a 3D object, and old-fashioned heavy letter press books have texture and depth you won&#x27;t get on a screen.<p>But you don&#x27;t <i>see</i> the depth of the stroke or the texture of the paper when you&#x27;re reading. You see abstract lines. You don&#x27;t <i>see</i> the imperfect squiggles our meat-appendages create unless you really focus; at a glance, your brain autocorrects them into the intended strokes.<p>>Minimalism has one big problem - it lacks scale-independence. A hand-printed book has visual detail across a range of physical dimensions. You can see the cover across a room, but if you look at the print with a magnifying glass, you&#x27;ll see detail at that scale too.<p>>Minimalist digital typography has detail at exactly one dimension - the size of the content.

This helps flesh out any further information I’ll need before I begin.<p>Once I’m satisfied that I understand the problem I’ll sketch out a planned architecture (dependency graphs, data structures, etc). If this uncovers more missing information then I’ll get that information and revisit the requirements and assumptions. Sometimes the missing information is that I don’t actually know how to do something in the particular environment I’m coding in. In that case I’ll prototype the minimum code I need to figure out how to do what I need to (I never use the prototype in production code).<p>Once I have a planned architecture that I’m happy with, writing the tests and code is relatively mechanical and straight-forward.<p>I’ll do this for pretty much any change to a codebase that is more complicated than changing a single function.",1424386493

Globally locking data is something the universe doesn&#x27;t even do, we are bound by the laws of physics and can&#x27;t get faster than the Speed of Light to transmit information. So you have to make a trade off.<p>Now, the cool thing is that you can use AP systems to creating globally locking/strong consistency behavior ontop. I do plan for there to be some plugins/modules that handle this for you, as long as you are aware you&#x27;re moving into either a very potentially SLOW system, or a centralized one.<p>Also, CRDTs are something that are really important to look into. They&#x27;re a good reason to try parting ways with CP systems, because they have some fantastic guarantees on data integrity.<p>We&#x27;re working (as I previously mentioned) on getting academics and papers involved and written.

People early on mined it and therefore own larger amounts for relatively little effort or cost. Now it&#x27;s worth more and they have reason to perpetuate its growth. Investors now have joined gamble and speculating by putting in $100s of millions of real cash in hopes they can help stabilize it and make their current Bitcoin worth 10x to 100x more just by getting more people to adopt it. There are some people who accept Bitcoin in exchange for services, and more accepting it for goods, however it&#x27;s those base Bitcoins that were mined that are the problem.<p>Re: USD for EUR - As you mentioned above those are at set rates between fiat currencies, and therefore there is practical reasons for the currency having a value.

9077710,comment,9075520,9077122,0,0,laeus,,,"Having worked in games for 13 years, at studios large and small and projects of the same variety, source code access has almost never blipped on the radar. The few times when we had issues with various engines for which we didn&#x27;t have source, our support contracts gave us the changes we needed to ship on time. On occasion we modified the engine, only to be hit by tricky merges with subsequent releases. In general, I&#x27;ve found that modifying an engine should be done by engine programmers (and if a game company does enough engine development to have such specialists, it&#x27;s probably not licensing any of these options).<p>The latest Unreal is a wonderful piece of engine software. Their blueprint system as well as their material editor and best-in-class renderer really are something to talk about. They also have a gigantic learning community. And I think their licensing terms are a good approach.<p>However, Unity has blazing fast compilation time on the order of seconds, a properly built play-in-editor mode, large asset and plugin ecosystem, seamless asset pipeline, and support for a modern programming language in C#. Each of these could arguably be considered a game changer in isolation, but in aggregate they are an efficiency avalanche. Nothing makes a better game, faster, than being able to go from idea to prototype in five minutes rather than two hours. It&#x27;s possible to try more things, to discard ten or even fifty bad ideas for every good one, and still come out ahead. This is what it all comes down to, in my experience. And when you&#x27;re done, you can port your game to over a dozen platforms (in some edge cases by simply changing a dropdown value).<p>That said, I&#x27;m happy that both engines are so good, because it means neither will rest on its laurels. Unreal&#x27;s marketplace and Unity 5&#x27;s renderer are no accidents.",1424386354

For my purposes, the raw tech/price specs were not enough to matter.<p>My old xps 13 dev had a higher resolution screen, but it ended up being more of a problem than a bonus, mainly due to the inability of most of the ubuntu ecosystem to scale gui elements well.  I could go on in more detail on this, but the fact is that Apple chose an even multiple for pixel scaling in retina displays (so non-retina apps can simply be displayed at effectively at twice normal size).  In FullHD, some manner of fractional scaling must be employed on a 13&quot; screen, and it needs to be done across the OS gui elements, as well as the rest of the app ecosystem in order for it to look right.

HLS is a draft standard of the IETF proposed by Apple, but Apple has never pursued standardization beyond that. This effectively means Apple maintains complete control of HLS and can change it however they want while still passing it off as a pseudo-standard. DASH was made by MPEG-LA, mainly to continue forcing their patent ridden nightmare video codec down everyones throats, but they got through full ISO standardization.<p>The third wheel there would be Flash - not a standard at all, a proprietary streaming protocol that is only usable by Adobe. They have no intent to standardize, and no intent to open the tech up ever. That is the kind of vendor lock in the OP talks about. All three were &quot;something new&quot;, but each one did something different. And when you are making a product, you could take explicit steps to document your protocols and architecture, or you could keep it all proprietary and user hostile and try to maintain maximal control of everything.<p>Another good example is messaging. XMPP is another IETF standard, Telegram is a proprietary server with an open protocol, while Skype, iChat, Hangouts, and Whatsapp are wholly proprietary. You can implement XMPP servers or clients, and clients and servers can interoperate (assuming the server lets you, Facebook uses XMPP but their server isn&#x27;t a full implementation, so you cannot add non-facebook friends in the service, for example). Telegram lets you implement clients however you want, but the protocol is designed to only work with their messaging servers, so you would have to fork the protocol to have server independence from Telegram.

About the only thing that would grow in this stuff would be pine trees, so we would plant pine saplings to kickstart the forest growth.

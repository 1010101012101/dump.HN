Development timelines should be fast, budgets should be inexpensive, the overall concept should be simple and hardware should be as tiny as possible.<p>The one way we have today to accomplish all those goals together is unmanned aircraft.  Simple because no life safety systems.  Tiny because no human factors (displays, radios, windscreens).  Cheap because no need to get every plane home safe (mission success largely determined by delivery of sufficient quantity of planes to the theatre).",1376488734

6211498,comment,6209954,6211113,20,0,akjj,,,"> This is obvious from the kind of nitpicking that goes on (no references! 4.37 m/s^2 is the maximum motion sickness possible because an accredited expert proposed it; I&#x27;ve never seen 4.9 m/s^2, but it&#x27;s surely a barf comet!)<p>This isn&#x27;t nitpicking. Dealing with the acceleration around curves is going to be a problem for any transit system and at higher speeds it becomes a bigger problem. Unlike bathrooms, this is going to be intrinsic to any system that carries human beings. As the author points out that the hyperloop proposal has significantly higher acceleration than any other high-speed system that he knows about.<p>So, how did the hyperloop designers decide that 4.9 m/s^2 would be safe? Did they find some study which tested this level of acceleration on average people? Did they conduct their own study which overturned conventional wisdom? Did they look at the research which led to the 4.37 m/s^2 figure and determine that it was fatally flawed? This is a critical issue and if the designers don&#x27;t explain themselves, then it&#x27;s fair to assume they made it up.<p>The hyperloop proposal contains innovative elements (air suspension in evacuated tubes) and elements which are essentially common with many other transit systems (viaducts, human passengers). The designers deserve credit for the former, but they can&#x27;t sweep the details of the latter under the rug. The point of references is not stylistic and not to name-check previous work. The point is that when you&#x27;re doing something, which has had lots of previous research, you either use that research to justify your claims or you explain why yours will be different.<p>> The really interesting, constructive questions: does this low-pressure air cushion thing really work? what are some factors that we need to explore to determine its true efficiency?<p>Those are interesting questions and if Musk had proposed just the air cushion technology, then that&#x27;s all we would be talking about. People would build test pieces to validate the technology and then go looking for applications. Instead, Musk choose to also include a specific proposal for a replacement for the LA-SF high-speed rail line and to estimate the costs at a tenth as much. That&#x27;s what got the most media attention and so that&#x27;s the aspect the OP chose to criticize.<p>BTW, you seem to be implying that the OP is a civil engineer or a transportation engineer with an axe to grind, but he&#x27;s just an amateur and if you look at his other posts you&#x27;ll see that he has a lot of concerns for reducing the costs of infrastructure projects.",1376488719

It MIGHT be valid under the following assumptions:<p>1.  The weight of the train and the hyperloop capsules are the same<p>2.  The construction methods employed are identical.<p>But they&#x27;re not!  Average train car weight (if they have to comply with FRA regulations) should be in the 60 ton range.  <a href=""https://www.ebbc.org/rail/fra.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ebbc.org/rail/fra.html</a> and <a href=""http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060828075317AACG9vx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=2006082807531...</a>  Average train car length is betwen 60 and 80 feet so we&#x27;ll go with 80.<p>60 tons / 80 feet = 1500lbs/foot.  In the case that a non-FRA compliant car can be used, that number SHOULD drop to about 750lbs/foot.<p>The hyperloop cars are speculated to be 16.5 tons and 28.5 tons each.  No hard numbers on length but if you assume 3ft per passenger and 28 total (14 per side) and add a bit of room for the other stuff, you can come up with 14 * 3+15=57 feet or for three cars, 3 * 20+15=75 feet.<p>33,000lbs / 57 feet = 578lbs/ft.
57,000lbs / 75 feet = 760lbs/ft<p>So it looks like the big-case hyperloop will weigh about the same as the best-case high speed rail.<p>Now let&#x27;s analyze the support mechanism.  Trains run on rails (two of them) and they weigh ~100 lbs per foot and are around 3&quot; wide and 6&quot; tall.  These rails need to be very precisely supported both side-to-side and up-and-down especially if the trains are going to run at 200+ MPH.  For viaduct you&#x27;ve got to build the bridge, then put down the ties, then put rail on top of those, fasten it down, etc.  Ties are in the range of 6-8&quot; thick and then there&#x27;s the ballast (rocks) which aren&#x27;t light either and which are generally required to keep the ties from moving.  On bridges (viaduct) you might do something newer and fancier but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it here in the US.  Overall you&#x27;ve got at least 200lbs/foot for the rails and I might guess another 500-1500lbs/foot for the ties and ballast and such.  Rock weighs ~150lbs/cuft and so does concrete so if your ties + ballast are a foot thick and 8 feet wide (rails are 4&#x27;8&quot; plus 20&quot; extra on the sides) that&#x27;s 1200lbs/foot.<p>Hyperloop runs in a 7.5 foot diameter tube with a 0.8in thick wall.  7.5 * 12 * pi * 0.8=226 square inches cross section.  Or a foot of it has 2712 cubic inches of steel.  At 0.283lbs/cu-in that comes out to be 767lbs/foot.  Because it&#x27;s pipe (which has excellent structural geometry) it is self-supporting and thus all you really have to do is get the pipe properly supported on top of the pylons, weld two sections together and you&#x27;re done.<p>Here&#x27;s the last part.  Hyperloop cars will be at least a mile apart.  That means the system can be designed to support just one of them per pylon.  Train cars will be 3 feet apart, and thus the viaducts have to support 1500lbs/foot * 80 feet per car * 10 cars = 600 tons.  Versus the hyperloop car weights of 16.5 tons or 28.5 tons.<p>So these two systems are mildly different in terms of their car weights but dramatically different in terms of the overall structural requirements and design to meet those structural requirements.  Train track is heavy and train cars are heavy and trains are fairly dense (due to their length).  Hyperloop cars are about half as heavy and hyperloop track is half as heavy and hyperloop support densities are only about half versus rail.  0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125 or 12.5% which isn&#x27;t terribly far off from the 10% number that the Hyperloop is quoted to cost versus the high speed rail system.<p>TL;DR: Cut track weight by half, car weight by half, and total support weight by half and you get 0.125 which is suspiciously close to 0.10, the number that the article author had such a problem with.<p>EDIT1: formatting<p>EDIT2: tl;dr",1376488324

When the program is billed as &quot;one plane for all 3 services,&quot; you know there&#x27;s trouble brewing on the horizon.<p>It&#x27;s telling that a lot of the quotes from this article comes from former members of the &quot;fighter mafia&quot; that pushed for focused designs from small groups done in &quot;stealth&quot; before the committees with their &quot;mission creep&quot; hit the design process.  The F-16 and A-10, as a result, were widely hailed as revolutionary designs for the roles they were meant for (although in hindsight they followed the obvious path for air superiority and close air support aircraft).  The F/A-18 was not quite as capable, but was nevertheless able to benefit from the design knowledge gained by these programs.<p>The managers/designers of the F-16 and A-10 programs include Chuck Spinney and Pierre Sprey, both heavily quoted here.  John Boyd was one of the major figures, and is probably one of the most hated men in the Pentagon, but has since passed away.<p>The F-35 is succeeding brilliantly in its mission, though, which is to funnel taxpayer money to a nice fat cross section of the military-industrial complex.",1376488291

First and foremost, gorilla arm.[1] My presumption with the &quot;interface of the future&quot; is that it&#x27;s needed for prolonged use. So, first thing&#x27;s first, the interface can&#x27;t be one where our arms require our hands to be higher than our elbows. Unless of course our species got a whole lot stronger in the forearm to support such a feature. Don&#x27;t see our species doing that anytime soon.<p>2. Feedback - Right now the feedback loop is eye->brain->hand->brain->eye (repeat) where the hand&#x27;s pressure against a solid surface is the most important feedback response. With the minority report style interface we currently have a massive delay (comparatively speaking) between the brain->hand->brain loop. We also have to iterate the whole loop much more because we need to constantly assess with our eye where our hand is in 3D (not digital) space. Now let&#x27;s say the technology gets much better and reduces this to 5ms. We are now bound by the differences of our synapses firing between touch and light. I could be wrong, but it&#x27;s my assumption that due to the speed of light being the way that it is, that &quot;touch&quot; will always beat &quot;sight&quot; in performance.<p>For prolonged used applications my bet is on adaptive surfaces. For short term (turning an stove on, flicking a light switch, etc) interfaces I potentially see this Minority Report style interface happening. But does the benefit cost of innovation?

How would we determine that a company has high growth potential without actually starting the company and trying to find out?

First of all you are assuming that equality currently exists, and therefore anything that might have show a bias is inherently unequal. If your assumption were true, you&#x27;d have a point. However, it is not true: there are lots of places where imbalance exists.<p>Second you are assuming that the imbalances are based on some inherent gender differences (in a previous point you make some claim about &quot;socialness&quot;). This point is somewhat contentious, and not well evidenced (that is to say, there is at least as much evidence for as against such points), or just plain shown to be false. If you can show a preponderance of agreement in facts, I will change my position. Evidence required for such.<p>Third, your claims that, corrective actions to an existing imbalance are the same as those same actions when furthering an imbalance or creating an imbalance. This is true in the pedantic sense - the actions are the same. However, the consequences and motivation for the actions must be taken into account. If the motive is to correct an imbalance, and the consequence is imbalance correction, then different considerations must be made. If I use a scalpel to remove someone&#x27;s kidney, the circumstances surrounding the action matter a lot - as a surgeon performing a transplant it&#x27;s ok, as a psychopath getting his jollies it isn&#x27;t.<p>Finally you are using a slightly different definition of sexism than many. You will argue till you&#x27;re breathless, use annoying semantic pedantry, general point missing, and other disingenuous BS to try and counter me, but here it is: the sexism people are talking about is systemic, the fact that statistically speaking, women are faced with an imbalance that seems only to apply because of gender. The sexism you are using is &quot;acknowledges gender in actions&quot;. They are different and have different implications. Too bad you keep demonstrating a basic choice to ignore things like implication, multi-step reasoning, and acknowledgement of definitions of words that you don&#x27;t like.",1376485220

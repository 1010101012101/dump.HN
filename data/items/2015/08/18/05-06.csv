(A)&#x27;s argument is that murderers are criminals, but thieves are not murderers, and therefore cannot be criminals.  The lack of logical validity of that argument aside, (B) refutes it instead by providing (quite literally) a counter-example:  (A) is both a thief and a criminal.  Therefore, if (B)&#x27;s assertion is true, (A)&#x27;s argument cannot be correct, for if it were correct, then (A) could be a thief or a criminal, but never both.<p>Since this is a logical argument, it prejudges the matter to conclude that the standard of evidence required for (B)&#x27;s assertion should be any different than that for (A)&#x27;s assertion.  We know (A)&#x27;s assertion to be false without any extra information.  If there were external details of evidence that could be introduced, then (A)&#x27;s assertion would still be false.  (B)&#x27;s assertion, however, might then still be either true or false, depending on the extra lemmas.  As the example does not make additional information <i>necessary</i> and does not mention additional information, it is an error to arrive at an interpretation in which additional information is required to make sense of the matter.

10077775,comment,10075683,10077064,0,0,useerup,,,"> Docker is really cool! Everyone is talking about Docker!<p>Stupid MS. They should have known that they cannot think that anything developed outside MS is cool. We have a cult thing going here, and MS you are not invited!<p>> We at Microsoft like Docker, too! (But Docker obviously screws us pretty hard, since the whole ecosystem is built around the Linux kernel. Windows isn&#x27;t great at this type of isolation.)<p>No, they are saying that OS virtualization is a necessity for Azure, and that they&#x27;ve adopted the Docker container format because it applies equally well to Linux, Windows or any other operating system. There is nothing inherent Linux about Docker, and there is <i>certainly</i> NOTHING tying it to the Linux kernel, contrary to your claim. But they should have known that they are not welcome in the cult, so they should have developed their own container format?<p>> We don&#x27;t like being left out of the Docker container party, so we&#x27;re going to create _two_ things that are Almost As Good As Docker Containers!<p>No - they are creating Docker containers for Windows which is equivalent to Docker containers <i>for Linux</i>, using the same format, the same API and allowing for existing tools to be used. Is that bad?<p>And they are <i>also</i> creating a specialized Virtual Machine capable of hosting a single container so that we can decide at <i>deployment time</i> whether we want a) higher density but less isolation or b) lower density but higher isolation. Which - to be honest - makes perfect sense, as that decision is mostly about trust of the environment in which you deploy and should not in any way affect how the container is developed and packed.<p>> (1) A new package format, &quot;Windows Server Containers,&quot; that we&#x27;re calling a container, even though it doesn&#x27;t actually offer containment. Containers can mess with other containers.<p>They are called containers because it is <i>Docker containers</i>. Containers are a way to ship configured applications with minimal concern about the configuration of the host. They isolate your application from specifics on the host, <i>including</i> isolation from what else is running on the host.<p>The security concerns about containers (yes Linux containers as well) are well understood. Containers <i>share</i> the operating system, and thus there is a higher risk of cross-container contamination compared to virtual machines (VMs).<p>Contrary to your Linux cult view, security of (Linux) containers is not perfect. As Mark Russinovich points out, a simple privilege escalation (seen any of those lately, hmm?) could allow complete cross-container compromise.<p>Mark Russinovichs comments about <i>trust</i> of the environment makes perfect sense. Make sure you <i>trust</i> the containers running on your system. If you developed those yourself or obtained them from a trusted source - fine. If they are controlled by some less trusted entity, then assume that they - or someone who comprimises them - could be hostile and try to gain access to other containers.<p>> (2) The same old Windows Server virtual machines, but we&#x27;re going to call them &quot;Hyper-V Containers.&quot; Yeah, they&#x27;re just VMs. Separate kernels in memory and all of that.<p>You misunderstand the point. Yes, the Hyper-V container <i>is</i> based on existing virtual machine technology. Nothing new there. The point is that you can use such a single-container VM as an alternative target <i>at deployment time</i>.<p>If you develop an application (say, a website) and package it as a container, you can deploy it to a container-aware OS. But if you are deploying it alongside untrusted containers, you&#x27;ll want a higher degree of isolation, regardless of OS. That&#x27;s where Hyper-V containers comes in.<p>> We know neither of these offer what you wanted. But good news! You can use the same container format for _both_ of these new almost-a-container systems.\nYikes.<p>It is exactly what a lot of us want. It may not be what the cult wants, but let&#x27;s be honest here: Microsoft could <i>never</i> produce anything the cult would want.<p>Take a cue from Linus Torvalds and get a cure for your Microsoft hate disease. Containers <i>are</i> cool, and they offer great value, also on Windows. Be proud that a technology popularized on Linux also proliferated to Windows - that is if you had anything to do with.",1439877290

10077760,comment,10075832,10076988,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Absolutely true, but nuance is necessary.<p>For one, a major part of energy use today is non-electric because it makes more sense to use fossil directly, than to use fossil to generate electricity and use that. But once you have cheaper electricity than fossil, and cleaner, you can start to see these industries shift towards electric.<p>Not everything is susceptible to that, like say chewing gum made of oil partially will not go electric obviously. But transportation likely will, and heating could possible go renewable (not necessarily electric. e.g. geothermal, solar thermal etc).<p>And so the cleaner electricity is, the fewer barrels of oil one would need in some non/low electricity industries right now, transportation being the biggest.<p>Secondly, it&#x27;s true that the majority of US oil isn&#x27;t from the middle east, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t matter to the US, that&#x27;s a silly argument to make. What happens if the middle east produced 0 oil the next 100 years? You can&#x27;t say &#x27;who cares&#x27;, obviously the world would go into a state of shock. Oil prices would skyrocket, production and consumption and worldwide trade would all drop sharply and recessions would break out. Which leads to unemployment, social welfare issues, friction, don&#x27;t even get started on wars between countries, civil wars would be damaging enough.<p>The 1970s showed how brutal oil politics could be to the economy, and that was small-scale compared to the most far reaching scenario.<p>And beyond that, anyone who exports to the US, like Canada, would think twice, after all why not sell it to China who&#x27;s willing to pay $500 a barrel, too?<p>Also, even if you don&#x27;t import the energy yourself, that doesn&#x27;t mean the US can&#x27;t profit or doesn&#x27;t profit when US companies are involved in the oil industry in the middle east, even if the region doesn&#x27;t export the majority of its oil to the US.<p>And lastly, even if you don&#x27;t import it yourself, you may want to control who has access to the oil, and in what currency it&#x27;s sold. You wouldn&#x27;t mind Germany selling Nuclear reactors to the Netherlands or vice versa, it&#x27;s a different story for Iran. Just like you might want to have some control over oil reserves because your control means China doesn&#x27;t have it, despite not being a top customer yourself.<p>As for the final point, the concept of petrodollars is real, and the fact oil trades are denominated in dollars, and the effect the standing as a reserve currency has on the US is significant.<p>The US doesn&#x27;t have to be a customer of middle east oil to have a benefit in controlling it, that&#x27;s naive and it&#x27;s getting a bit tiring to see everyone act like you&#x27;re a dumbass when you make this claim, always immediately pointing to charts of Saudi Arabian and Iraqi oil imports being so small compared to &#x27;omg lol US production & Canadian imports, you&#x27;re so dumb, bet you didn&#x27;t know that&#x27;. Don&#x27;t get me wrong not saying you do this but it&#x27;s a common theme when discussing the issue.<p>And really just look at history. You don&#x27;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to look at the middle east and conclude oil plays a role. When Iraq was getting decimated on forged evidence of WMD, guess who was developing WMD, admitted having WMD, and tested WMD, not just any kind but the nuclear kind? North Korea. Otherwise a beacon of democracy and human rights and quality of life. Comparing the eagerness and focus on invading this country and Iraq is telling.<p>I mean do you really think trillions of dollars were spent on an intelligence fluke? Or that the carter doctrine was some minor policy plan that has nothing to do with oil?<p>Besides it&#x27;s not like this is a secret. People like Cheney openly talked about the importance of controlling oil reserves, how demand would outstrip supply in the coming decades, and talking about how 2/3rd of oil is in the middle east and that access is important. Which brings up the final obvious point, which is that the US isn&#x27;t running energy policy because of today&#x27;s needs, but the needs in 50 years from now, so pointing to today&#x27;s import charts is not comprehensive enough an argument.<p>So hell yes, renewables have a substantial impact on all of that. They&#x27;re not the entire story, but a substantial part of it.",1439876718

I would definitely make sure that point is made somewhere on your website or app so people unfamiliar with it are aware of your value proposition since I&#x27;m sure there will be others like me wondering why Google wouldn&#x27;t suffice. That will probably make it worth the hassle of downloading another app/taking a picture of a receipt worth it for about 10% of your customers I would guess. As for the rest, I&#x27;m not sure how you could incentivize them better or what alternative methods of gathering this data could be.<p>Another problem you&#x27;ll encounter are outlying data sets and different terms. For instance, if somebody buys a phone without a contract it could be about $600, but if you get the same phone with a contract it could be free. While that&#x27;s just one example, it points out a clear problem with the taking pictures of receipts because you don&#x27;t know the terms at which the product was acquired. Also, demand and intelligence may contaminate your numbers. Let&#x27;s say somebody is selling a used TV which they bought for $2400 and selling it for $2300. Let&#x27;s also say it&#x27;s super bowl weekend and somebody just broke their tv and they&#x27;re huge football fans and want to go buy a new TV really quick. They buy this used TV for such a high price because they&#x27;re crunched for time and are desperate. I know it&#x27;s not the best example but it gets the point across. Somebody else will rarely be able to recuperate the same value for their tv as that person just did. So then you think you&#x27;ll just remove the outliers. However, if you do that, unless there&#x27;s a ton of people getting great deals, you&#x27;re going to be left with what the majority of people are paying for products, which will most likely be market rate, or the going rate without any negotiations.<p>Idk if you&#x27;ve encountered those problems, have solved them,or are currently working them out.

The first is electricity from panels they own on your roof. The other is a lease of panels they own on your roof that you get electricity from.<p>In essence SolarCity and everyone else bids for your roof and business through their pricing. (which currently undercuts utilities).<p>And SolarCity in return is creating solar bond products essentially, where the market can invest their capital in these roofs that SC is producing energy on, with the monthly bills as interest.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t solve the issue the person you replied to highlighted, which is that it may or may not be financially advisable to &#x27;hold out&#x27;, and buy solar when the price has come down. After all, even if you don&#x27;t buy and own the panels, the lease is still a 20 year contract. And there&#x27;s no way SolarCity or any company would reduce those to short-term contracts because there are fixed costs that can&#x27;t be recuperated in the short-term, meaning you need long-term contracts to get an ROI. (sending technicians to replace installations every few years wouldn&#x27;t make financial sense).<p>So the end result right now is that yes, you could in a way (by investing in solar companies or their financial products) invest in other people&#x27;s roofs, despite not dismantling panels on your roof, in say 5 years from now when new installations are financially better performing than your roof panels. But it doesn&#x27;t magically make your investment in your own roof (or anyone&#x27;s roof, 5 years ago, for that matter) disappear. The money is still locked up in that roof (whether you paid for it, or locked up money by signing a 20 year contract), and so merely decoupling everything doesn&#x27;t solve that issue, and in many ways we&#x27;re already decoupling to a large extent with the securitisation of roof installations.",1439874794

10077674,comment,10071695,10077607,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"Consider two schemes for payment of content.<p>A: You must decide, for each piece of data or information you consume,\nwhether and how much it is worth to you. I&#x27;ll note that in this discussion, not only did you not pay to read a work, but you couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to click a link to examine it. Which, actually, I applaud as a rational behavior: the odds of being rewarded with quality content by following an arbitrary link posted on an Internet discussion site by someone who&#x27;s preferred description is &quot;space alien cat&quot; is fairly low.<p>But it also rather handily demonstrates the specific failure mode of micropayments.<p>B: Information is paid out of a general cultural tax, apportioned by\nwealth or income. You may access as much (or as little) of the availed information as you choose. Creators are paid according to the access and performance of their works, tracked by one or more monitoring services.<p>Under the first scheme, there are numerous issues: the rich and poor have vastly different information access, as do children. Researchers who might reference many works (though often only in brief fragments) would have tremendous data charges, as might musicians or authors or photographsers, who typically have large reference libraries of relevant works. Those who don&#x27;t <i>directly</i> consume information <i>but benefit by its effects on society as a whole</i> pay nothing. Remixes of works would be difficult to arrange given complex rights negotiations.<p>Under the second scheme, there&#x27;s no concern <i>at the time of access</i> whether or not the work is worth paying for (though in circumstances where you&#x27;re accessing <i>physical</i> resources or premeses: a book, a recording, a performance venue) you would still typically pay. Children and the poor would have as much access as any other. Researchers and artists could reference works as needed without concern as to cost. Remixes of works would be straightforward. Payment would be made regularly throughout the year.<p>At first blush, scheme A describes what we have today, and scheme B is a utopian broadband tax / content syndication scheme. Actually, this is entirely backwards: scheme B is largely the system we have in place today, <i>except that instead of a government-imposed tax, it&#x27;s one based on advertisers and paid through higher prices for goods purchased regularly throughout the year.</i> Total advertising spending in the United States is $181 billion per year -- $567 per person in 2014.[1] Artists are paid through either ratings-based metrics for music, or according to negotiated television contracts for actors, screenwriters, and such. There&#x27;s one key difference though: under an advertising-based system, it&#x27;s ultimately the <i>advertiser</i> who calls the shots on content, and content is geared to maximise advertising-based appeal. This shapes both the types of works produced and the topics covered.<p>A broadband tax approach changes one element of this: how revenues are collected. It&#x27;s either through an access provider (your ISP, cable, or broadband service), or through a public tax imposed independently. Allocate some or all of the $567 per-person advertising cost presently collected, and it would be transferred <i>directly</i> to authors, composers, musicians, actors, reporters, researchers, etc. Without the advertising middleman.<p>Your micropayments scheme requires a middleman and payment processor, trusted by both crators and consumers, some way of providing for refunds, and the somewhat problematic issue that there are limited capabilities to suck out any information you might have acquired but decided after the fact that you weren&#x27;t interested in actually paying for. At least, without inflicting possible brain damage. How do I keep you from copying my book, or music, or photos, or movie?<p>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<p>Notes:<p>1.

It may be a case where League of Legends already hit close enough to that sweet spot and built enough of a fanbase that HotS doesn&#x27;t stand a chance, even if it is better executed.<p>I would not call Diablo 3 a flop, by the way.

They&#x27;ve had enough breakout successes and &quot;unicorn&quot; level games that there&#x27;s something about the strategy and execution that sets Blizzard apart.<p>From what I can observe, it&#x27;s some mix of the following:<p>- Simplifying down the core gameplay to something that players can grasp quickly, without compromising complexity (that can be safely ignored for the initial stages).<p>- Making the core gameplay loop fun and repeatable without being repetitive.<p>- Making players feel rewarded for playing and purchasing.

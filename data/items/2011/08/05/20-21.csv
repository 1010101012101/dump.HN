I've been preparing for launch with various ideas, one of them being a Kickstarter campaign to help fund a book tour, which would start in September. Only problem is, Kickstarter rejected my first campaign. When I asked why, they said, simply:<p>> Kickstarter is primarily focused on creative arts projects, not the marketing of books or other products -- look around the site and you'll see what I mean. I understand what you're looking to do here, but it isn't what we're focused on.<p>But when I look around, I see there have been several other book tours funded by Kickstarter:<p>* Live, Work, and Play Like a Liberal: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/280586197/justin-krebs-living-liberally-book-tour<p>* The Internet of Elsewhere: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1731685895/the-internet-of-elsewhere-european-book-tour<p>* Urban Scouts Book Tour: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/13979723/urban-scouts-book-tour<p>But, I noticed that these campaigns focused more on the overarching mission of the books, rather than on the books themselves. So, I revamped my proposal, in the form of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WGNCk4ClzU<p>I submitted this about 5 days ago, and haven't heard a thing from Kickstarter since. They got back to me quickly the first time, but I feel like they may be ignoring me.<p>So, I'm not sure what to do. It would be great to have a campaign, not only to help fund my book tour, but to get the word out about my book. So, I guess amongst my questions are:<p>* Have you done a Kickstarter campaign before? Is there anything I should know?<p>* Any ideas on why they may be rejecting me?<p>* Any feedback on my video?<p>* Is there another platform I should be using? Should I just dig in and spend several thousand dollars funding my own tour?<p>Thanks for your help!",1312577757

2851704,comment,2851470,2851470,26,0,ChristianMarks,,,"The OP's post could use some context.<p>Ricardos concept of comparative advantage was forged in a world where labor and capital were essentially fixed. England could weave cloth more efficiently than Spain, but Spain could make wine more efficiently than England. Therefore, they would both benefit from trade given that each of these countries had a comparative benefit or efficiency to offer. The assumption under comparative advantage is, while the composition of employment would change under trade (more weavers employed in England and more wine makers in Spain), the level of employment would stay virtually the same. Meanwhile the citizens of England would get cheaper wine and the Spanish cheaper cloth.<p>In todays world, labor and capital are not fixed. Capital flows wherever the input costs are the cheapest, such as labor and materials. Companies can set up operations in many places around the world. For instance, an American multinational no longer has to produce in the country where it sells, given existing trade treaties that lower tariffs. They can shift production to China or Mexico where the labor costs are a fraction of what it is in the U.S. and not be penalized by tariffs or quotas. In effect workers get fired in the U.S.; this leads to a loss of income for the working and middle classes. The workers in Mexico and China benefit because they have jobs, albeit at low wage rates and substandard conditions in many cases. Contrary to received wisdom, prices for some products might be lower, but not significantly so. The difference in wages (from those in the developed world versus the developing world) goes to investors, or more accurately these days, management. This is trade by absolute advantage, not comparative advantage.<p>For a while GDP growth seems to be fine. But with production set up abroad, the U.S. runs trade deficits and Americans by definition incur more debt to buy these goods. NAFTA encourages this. As a member of the WTO, China benefits from this trade agreement in that its goods are levied with lower tariffs than would otherwise be the case. Moreover, China manipulates its currency to keep it artificially low. Under a reciprocal trade regimen, the currency of a country that exports more than it imports should rise. A rising currency would act as a braking system to bring trade flows back into equilibrium. But the U.S. and China do not want that. China needs to keep selling goods to the world to continue growing fast enough to generate enough jobs. Despite its protests from time to time, the U.S. government does not\nwant this because it is captured by the multinationals, which make much more money not employing Americans (or Europeans for that matter). So when media pundits and approved economists say they are puzzled by the lack of employment growth, it is theatre, a necessary piece of kabuki to keep their jobs as propagandists.<p>Free trade under a truly Ricardian model of comparative advantage is theoretically beneficial to the world because at its heart lies the assumption of full employment. Instead what is touted as free trade is not Ricardian; it is a model of absolute advantage that ensures that the wages of labor are depressed, thereby enabling the rise in income for the top 1%.<p>The problem for the elites is that these are not sustainable political or economic policies because eventually unemployment will reach unacceptable levels and the right leader will come along and tell the real story to the American people.<p><i></i><i></i><p>As long as the political power of the middle and working classes has been undermined and blunted, U.S. multinationals will not hire Americans if they can offshore production. Therefore, people need to be organized to buy goods and services from small businesses whose interests are more aligned with that of the nation. Also, Wall Street should be boycotted. Do not do business with big banks. (I belong to a credit union.) Invest in regional financial institutions. Wall Street, because of its power over Washington, has been able to push through unfair trade bills in exchange for the right to set up shop in those foreign countries that benefit from access to American markets. But it is a one-sided deal in practice. U.S. access to foreign markets translates to this: multinationals offshore production and export to the U.S. at low or nonexistent tariffs.<p>If you want access to Chinese markets you must manufacture and hire people in China. Also, you must share your intellectual property with local firms. Multinationals accept this as the cost of doing business in China, although the real cost is being borne by the working and middle classes in this country.<p>Unless there is a substantial reversal in these policies, expect many years of sub par economic growth and high unemployment in the U.S. So why should anyone be surprised when the U.S. GDP growth rate for the second quarter is dismal? Unless of course, they are paid to be surprised.",1312577381

I don't think this piece holds much weight because he's connecting two unrelated phenomenon (a downturn caused by overuse of credit and automation).  Note the retailers he cites (Circuit City, Sharper Image, KB Toys) were generally killed off by other local retailers (most notably Walmart but also Best Buy, Toys R Us, etc...)<p>That said I do believe automation will begin to eat away at jobs when we get to the point where robotics can duplicate the functions performed by low end labor.  What I mean by that is up until now computers have largely replaced more cerebral occupations.  That allowed the people in those occupations to move on to higher level thinking.<p>Think of the growth in economic theory since the computer was invented.  That had a lot to do with the fact that we can now test economic models in minutes instead of months because a computer can do the calculation.<p>So in those cases the computer didn't replace the job it just enhanced it.  But dock workers doing heavy lifting aren't going to to turn into robotics engineers.  Meaning the change coming with robotics will be different from previous technology shifts.

2851684,comment,2849975,2849975,16,0,grellas,,,"It's ""every man for himself"" in the patent world today, as Google is discovering much to its dismay with Android. The flood of junk that today besets the system didn't used to flow through in this way. The combination of an under-funded, inadequately staffed, and not-properly-trained USPTO, antiquated standards of patentability that don't apply to a rapidly changing world of software innovations, judges who shrug their shoulders in passive reactive mode as lawyers push large numbers of ill-conceived cases through their courts, and a Congress that has little or no accountability to anyone beyond the self-interested parties who largely shape its agenda - all these and more have led to a crisis in the patent world that no one seems either willing or able to solve.<p>I personally don't think the answer lies in abolishing patents because I don't think there is or likely ever will be sufficient impetus behind such an effort to make it happen. There is more hope someday of doing away with software patents but this will take many years given the recent <i>Bilski</i> ruling and Congressional inertia.<p>I don't pretend to have an answer to this. I suspect that, long term, there needs to be a severe curtailment of software patents, if not an outright abolition, in order to bring the system in line with what it used to be 20+ years ago. I have represented innovators for decades. In the past, I used to tell them: don't copy someone else's code unless you have a right to, watch out about misusing a former employer's IP, etc. and you will be fine. Today, I can't do that. Anyone can wind up infringing all sorts of nebulous patents at any time simply by doing completely independent and innovative work using nothing but one's own skills, knowledge, and talents. That is a very sorry place to be, and it has to change but how and when - that is what is so very frustrating. The author of this piece has the right sense of things but he, like me, winds up at the end basically howling at the moon in frustration over the utterly dispiriting short-term course of events.",1312577065

Letters 737:L29, 2011 August 20\n   DOI: 10.1088/2041-8205/737/2/l29\n   http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/737/2/L29/\n</code></pre>\nThe key sentence from that abstract is<p>""PAMELA data show that the magnetospheric antiproton ux in the SAA exceeds the cosmic-ray antiproton ux by three orders of magnitude at the present solar minimum, and exceeds the sub-cutoff antiproton ux outside radiation belts by four orders of magnitude, constituting the most abundant source of antiprotons near the Earth.""<p>The cosmic ray flux is estimated in another paper on the PAMELA results:<p><pre><code>   ""PAMELA Results on the Cosmic-Ray \n   Antiproton Flux from 60 MeV to 180 \n   GeV in Kinetic Energy""\n   Physical Review Letters 105, 121101 (2010)\n   DOI:	10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.121101\n   http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v105/i12/e121101\n</code></pre>\nAfter eyeballing Fig. 1, I'd say they measured most antiprotons to be between 1 GeV and 10 GeV, with a flux of ~2x10^-2 / (GeV m^2 s sr).  (sr=steradians.) The flux peaks around 2 GeV.<p>Rough multiplication gives an estimate of total flux:<p><pre><code>   [2x10^-2 / (GeV m^2 s sr)]*[9 GeV]*[10^14 m^2]*[4 pi sr] \n     = 2*10^14  antiprotons/second.\n</code></pre>\nIf we ignore the kinetic energy of the antiprotons, and assume there are plenty of available protons to annihilate with them, we get about 2 GeV per antiproton.  This yields<p><pre><code>   [2*10^14  antiprotons/second]*[2 GeV/anitproton]\n       =  6x10^ 4  J/s\n</code></pre>\nThe space shuttle orbiter weighs 69,000 kg empty.  The escapte velocity from earth (which doesn't change much between the surface and the edge of the atmosphere) is 11.2 km/s, so the minimum energy needed to get it out of the earth's atmosphere is<p><pre><code>   [1/2]*[69,000 kg]*[11.2 km/s]^2\n      = 4x10^12 J\n</code></pre>\nOK, so it would take about 10^8 s, or 3 years, to collect enough energy from antiproton cosmic-ray rest mass to lauch a space-shuttle size object out of Earth's gravity.  And you'd have to scoop up from the <i>entire</i> surface area above the earth.<p>Now, the magnetospheric antiproton flux in the South Atlantic Anomaly<p><pre><code>    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Atlantic_Anomaly\n</code></pre>\nis said to be 3 orders of magnitude larger than the normal antiproton cosmic ray flux.  By looking at the wikipedia page, it looks like the SAA covers about 10% of the surface area above the earth.  If we were able to scoop up <i>all</i> of the antiprotons in the magnetospheric belt, it would then take about 10^6 s, or 11 days, to get enough energy to launch a space-shuttle sized object.<p>I am highly, highly unsure about these number and the assumptions that went into them, but it at least suggests it's possible to do.

2851518,comment,2840103,2843170,1,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"Okay, here are my thoughts. The standard disclaimer (I'm actually a mathematician-cryptographer, I just play a security guy on the internet) applies: don't rely too much on me. I hear tptacek does security evaluations, for a fair price. ;-)<p>Here are some comparisons (because I don't have numbers for cracking speed either):<p>Block ciphers: 80-bit keys seem to be uncrackable for now (although pretty much everyone recommends 128-bit keys). You're a work factor of 2^80 / 2^64 = 2^16 away from that level of security, but PBKDF2 should be able to supply that (against every attack I can think of, at least). As a very rough guide, my laptop does ~3 million AES (which is not a 80-bit cipher, but should be of comparable speed) invocations on a small buffer per core per second, according to ""openssl speed"", so you'd aim for 3 million/2^16 ~= 50 crypts per second.<p>Passwords: passwords with 64 bits of actual entropy (e.g. 12 truly random uppercare/lowercase characters) are extremely rare - the typical entropy of a human-selected password seems to be ~18 bits, which causes security people lots of trouble. OpenBSD's bcrypt takes, again on my laptop and this time timed with a very imprecise 'for i in `jot 1000 0 0`; do encrypt -b6 foo >/dev/null; done', about 7 seconds per 1000 crypts (single-core). (Note that OpenBSD's value hasn't been increased for a long time.) So aiming for 100 crypts per second gets you about the same security as a very good password with a standard login procedure, and 10^5 crypts per second (10 milliseconds per crypt, equivalent to a password with ~54 bits of entropy and a standard login procedure) is still far better than typical for password-based systems.<p>Something like 50-200 crypts/second probably does allow DDoS attacks via repeated (attempted) logins. On one hand, I wouldn't worry <i>too</i> much: articles like <a href=""http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=54907"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=54907</a> suggest that you could knock even a sizable dedicated server offline for a week or so on a budget of a thousand bucks, which is probably a more realistic threat (if only because it doesn't require much sophistication). On the other hand, as long as the attacker doesn't gain direct database access but has to go through your front ends, password-based systems seem to mostly work in the real world - rate-limiting helps a lot. (Of course, it also helps that the average Facebook account just isn't very valuable.)<p>If you do want security from brute-force attacks by attackers who do get access to your database, and if you are unwilling to go to 128-bit keys (which basically solves the issue), consider 80-bit keys: it's three more BASE64 characters, but 80-bit keys alone seem to be sufficient for now (NIST recommends phasing them out in 2015 at the latest, but I know of no real attacks, and there are almost certainly juicier targets). Adding a variable work factor via PBKDF2 makes sense, if only to be able to scale up later without too much hassle. The above 2^16 would get you security sort-of-equivalent to 96-bit keys; something like 2^4 should be essentially instant.<p>In the end, though, this is a lot of complicated code that you'll have to write (and tptacek would tell you not to do it), and even if you get it right ""this guy implemented some nonstandard crypto"" will set off some alarm bells.<p>I think the industry-standard solution is to hand out RSA keyfobs (or the YubiKey, which may end up cheaper once you consider RSA's server-side licensing); do note that RSA recently got completely hacked and handled it very poorly (Google has plenty of details), and that the YubiKey RFID (specifically, the other models are fine) includes a totally broken MIFARE Classic chip (famously used on the ""OV-kaart"" here in the Netherlands.) Truly paranoid customers may have epoxy'd all their USB ports shut, which would rule out the YubiKey. I don't see how to handle encrypted data with either of these solutions. (Note: I have no idea how well the YubiKey stands up to physical attacks. I'm not sure you care, but...)",1312574817

What kind of freedom is that?",1312574576

The concept is that if you start with requiring real name, you prime people to give you the ""real"" things you like, your ""real"" preferences etc. It sets the tone, you are not longer spontaneous, you are ""serious"". Of course, it's all scaremongering: social networks don't have real informative comment, most people share jokes, mindless pleasantries and play games.",1312574483

New York, for example, says:<p>54-18(a) Inspection Following Trips from Airports. <i>Immediately after completing a trip to Kennedy, La Guardia or Newark Airports, the Driver must inspect the interior of the Taxicab and the trunk compartment, if used, to ensure that Passengers have collected their property.</i><p>54-18(b) Handling of Lost Property. <i>Property found by a Driver in a Taxicab must be returned to the Passenger if possible; otherwise, it must be taken without delay to the police precinct closest to where the Passenger was discharged.</i><p>54-18(c) Notifying Commission Regarding Lost Property. <i>If the property is not returned to the Passenger, the Driver must promptly inform the Commission of the details regarding the found property and the police precinct where it is held.</i><p>Note that 54-18(b) is not inclusive of (a), but only when transporting passengers to the listed airports is an inspection of the passenger area for lost or misplaced items required. If any items are found outside of those conditions, they still must be taken to the closest precinct, and the Taxi commission must be notified of the property and to which precinct it is located.<p>It is not the responsibility of the cab driver to track you down, outside of yelling at you while you are walking away from the cab. After that, it is your responsibility as a passenger with a lost item to track it down.",1312574474

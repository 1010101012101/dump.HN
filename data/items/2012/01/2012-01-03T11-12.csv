3419347,comment,3419241,3419335,0,0,jrockway,,,"Garbage.  The problem is not the transport-layer security.  Transport-layer attacks are very difficult to implement.  What is risky is what happens when someone gets access to the database and does ""SELECT * FROM user"".  This is a very realistic threat, and with properly hashed passwords, gives an attacker no useful information.  With plain-text passwords, though, they now have carte blanche to try the credentials at other sites, and steal someone's entire identities.<p>Yes, it's bad if you use the same password everywhere.  Yes, it's bad if someone man-in-the-middles you.  Yes, it's bad that arbitrary web users can run arbitrary database queries.  But the point of robust engineering is to protect a system from many failures.  If your passwords are stored in cleartext, your system is less safe overall than one that stores the passwords hashed.  And because it's so easy to hash passwords, and because it's so damaging to your users to leak their password, it's generally considered Pretty Fucking Incompetent to keep passwords around in cleartext.",1325591814

3419342,comment,3416777,3418326,0,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""The provinces of Canada with higher ethnic diversity and immigration""</i><p>What <i>kind</i> of immigration? The USA has the unfortunate status of being home to a <i>huge</i> population of generally impoverished immigrants, thanks to its over-focus on family reunification and humanitarian immigration paths, the ease/prevalence of illegal immigration, and combined with a complete ignorance of skilled immigration.<p>This is the opposite of Canada, where the immigration policy has for decades strongly favored skilled immigrants - and have let them in in far greater numbers (and greater ease) than humanitarian immigrants. Similarly, Canada has for the past decade or so slowly shut the door and raised the bar on family reunification. It should also be no surprise that illegal immigration is a substantially smaller problem here than it is in the USA.<p>The somewhat inconvenient and blunt way to put it is: Canada has, for the most part, received a socially desirable demographic of immigrants, and the USA has not.<p>On top of this, America has to deal with the legacy of slavery - which has created a huge population that continues to be marginalized (despite advancements) to this day. You can't oppress and systematically destroy a population's chances of success for nearly 200 years in a row and then magically expect them to pick right back up a mere 4-5 decades later. This race dynamic drives a <i>huge</i> part of American demographics, and in Canada this issue may as well not exist.<p>The issue of race in the US is a labyrinthine beast that the vast majority of Canada could not even begin to imagine. And for that Canadians are lucky.",1325591483

I am sure that he would call me an enemy to free software, even though I regularly contribute to it, and that he would therefore consider my actions absolutely immoral and inexcusable. But I don't think it's immoral and inexcusable to charge money for things in a meaningful way (i.e., a way that actually generates money), at least not in the current context. I've read Stallman's arguments and don't find them particularly convincing.<p>I also don't believe that GNU is entitled to a prefix every time a complete system that uses the Linux kernel and GNU toolchain is mentioned.<p>So where does that leave me? As far as I can tell, Stallman would refuse to work with me, disavow any relationship with me, and consider me an immoral provocateur that harms free software no matter how much good I do for it in actuality (due to my disavowal of freedom 2 as an essential element in moral software).<p>That kind of hardcore, unyielding, exclusive ideology makes it really hard to get anywhere with people.

Any time you set a password it travels in plain text (typically - and hopefully - via a secure connection) and it arrives to their server in plain text.

3. Inspiration. Many young developers write me and thanks me for inspire themto learn more, use more...<p>I titled it ""..pure CSS3"" because this iPhone is actually in pure CSS3, the JS part is for iPhone interaction. Without JS or with it - iPhone is anyway on pure CSS3.",1325591164

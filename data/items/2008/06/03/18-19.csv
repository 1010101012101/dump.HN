Like writing a typedef for a C function pointer -- I just check out a source file I wrote before or man qsort because I don't remember the exact syntax.  Or tricks with data structures -- I WROTE my own linked lists and trees but it's not something I do every day because it's pointless.  Or certain Python tricks -- if I haven't done them in a while I just look them up.<p>Gauntlets always turn out to be Gotchas!<p>The more junk you know, the less of it you are focused on at any given moment.  Give any CS major the <i>exact same</i> tests he took, 5 years after the fact, on the spot, and it's probably a straight fail.<p>I remember the <i>general sense</i> of things and outsource the details to my prior work, open source code I can refer to, and Google.",1212519345

Compiled without optimization (gcc -g -Wall -o mystrlen mystrlen.c mystrlen.s) with gcc 4.1.2 on an AMD Opteron 265, I get strlen() taking about 0.04 each time, compared with 0.18 for my_strlen() and 0.06 or 0.06 for ap_strlen_utf8_s (the elite assembly version).

These tests need to be done with optimization.<p>Compiled with optimization, (gcc -g -Wall -std=c99 -O2 -march=i686 -pedantic -o mystrlen mystrlen.c mystrlen.s), I get strlen() taking 0.02, versus my_strlen() at 0.04 and ap_strlen_utf8_s (the awesome assembly one) at 0.06 -- 200% slower.<p>So I'm not sure his results are right, even in the direction.

7298310,comment,7295190,7298153,1,0,wpietri,,,"One way to look at ordering features in early products is as risk reduction.<p>One of the biggest risks is, &quot;nobody gives a fuck&quot;, which is why MVPs are so valuable. It lets you test market hypotheses.<p>But if you&#x27;re building something handling real money, then a pretty obvious risk is, &quot;The system will lose money beyond our capacity to absorb losses.&quot; Their failure to address that risk here is at best negligence.<p>But given the size of the loss, I don&#x27;t think we should rule out fraud. The interesting question is, &quot;When did they know they had a problem?&quot; Sometimes shitty accounting systems are just naivet√©. But when they persist over a long period of time in a way that just happens to cover up loss, embezzlement, or theft, then it&#x27;s worth asking: did they keep the shitty accounting because better accounting would have forced them to admit something they were hoping to cover up?",1393343971

However, he&#x27;s also got to consider each app maker is unique.  McDonald&#x27;s makes an app because they have a marketing budget so large that their strategy is to appear everywhere - including your phone.  However, I generally agree with his point that not everyone needs an app, and they absolutely shouldn&#x27;t be giving us the mobile equivalent of the Javascript popup every time we hit their website (personally, I like the sites that just have a header bar drop down asking if I&#x27;d like to install the app that is easy to scroll past).<p>I don&#x27;t think the web is dead, but I do think mobile apps are the future.  The best UX I can imagine based on what is around right now is something like what Facebook is trying to do - apps that deep link to each other without the user realizing they are moving between apps.  The key here is that the apps must be specifically designed to maximize the user experience, not just to have an &quot;app.&quot;  We aren&#x27;t at that point yet, but remembering where the mobile web was back in 2005 when I got my first data plan compared to now keeps me incredibly optimistic about its future, as does knowing that some of the smartest people out there are thinking about this problem all the time (like the guys at URX).",1393342722

An APT/RPM style model strikes me as counter to the prevailing direction that Android, and Google more generally has been moving.<p>I think that from their perspective, mass market users don&#x27;t care about license terms or free-ness as in freedom. They seem to care about free-ness as in sticker price, even when it comes with prohibitive in-app purchase requirements. If we look at mass market targeted app stores based on APT-like repository systems, well, all we really have is the Ubuntu Software Center. And that isn&#x27;t clearly better than the Android Market to the mass market user, and I would go further to claim that the inverse is true. So I can&#x27;t see strategically why Google would change direction toward an Ubuntu Software Center style direction, and the higher quality but less user friendly APT/RPM/pacman is just a complete non-starter.<p>But CyanogenMod seems to have reached its market position by appealing to the ethics of openness.

7297955,comment,7293512,7295384,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by cache poisoning. If a resolver was queried for a single record type, that doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s the only record that resolver will return... That would break all kinds of things. Usually DNS servers return referrals to other record types if they don&#x27;t find the one they&#x27;re looking for, but in your example the correct record type always exists, so it should always be returned and cached properly. The mail server may decide to error out if it finds a CNAME where it expected only A and MX records.<p><i>edit</i> Oh, I see, this is a DNS spec issue, not an MTA or resolver issue. According to DNS specification clarification RFC2128, if a CNAME exists, no other record should exist with that name - so in theory a DNS server or resolver could simply drop all other records if it found a CNAME. (That seems like very bad behavior, though!)<p><pre><code>  10.1. CNAME resource records\n\n   The DNS CNAME (&quot;canonical name&quot;) record exists to provide the\n   canonical name associated with an alias name.  There may be only one\n   such canonical name for any one alias.  That name should generally be\n   a name that exists elsewhere in the DNS, though there are some rare\n   applications for aliases with the accompanying canonical name\n   undefined in the DNS.  An alias name (label of a CNAME record) may,\n   if DNSSEC is in use, have SIG, NXT, and KEY RRs, but may have no\n   other data.  That is, for any label in the DNS (any domain name)\n   exactly one of the following is true:\n\n     + one CNAME record exists, optionally accompanied by SIG, NXT, and\n       KEY RRs,\n     + one or more records exist, none being CNAME records,\n     + the name exists, but has no associated RRs of any type,\n     + the name does not exist at all.</code></pre>",1393340951

See the comment in the existing code right above the patch:<p><pre><code>    /* If nbytes was not specified, use the buffer&#x27;s length */\n</code></pre>\nSo it still seems to me that in order to be exploitable an application would need to specify a &quot;wrong&quot; value for nbytes, which after the patch would raise an exception.

Being able to comment too easily can make for dull and worthless ill thoughtout comments.   But breaking down that barrier is also a social lubricant.<p>I personally don&#x27;t have my own blog,  I just throw comments into the wind on the web.  If I were to host my own blog, I probably wouldn&#x27;t add a comment system for fear that I&#x27;d want to censor or moderate them!  But I&#x27;d welcome feedback.<p>My preference may be to have people email me their thoughts and for me to then add feedback to articles at a later time.   This might be a little burdensome and not practical whatsoever.<p>To many the discussion is in part the article.   And it feels too difficult to be at every table at the same time.<p>You could be absent from the conversation and leave your right to reply for a post mortem on your posts.

But let&#x27;s face it programmers have a higher wages, in part, b/c the technology is constantly changing and the supply of those who keep up is small. Since the structural barriers to most developers jobs are almost nothing (if you&#x27;re good someone will give you a job and you can even work remotely for an NYC company from Bangladesh) the shifting sand of technology is what drives our wages up.<p>Now here&#x27;s where you can win. The hiring manager or business owner wants to minimize risk. If you have 20 years experience working on mainframes in cobol, chances are you&#x27;re going to be an a passable programmer with good fundamentals. Now say the hiring managers company is using rails or node.js. You know you can learn it quickly. But The manager might be nervous that you that you don&#x27;t like to adjust and you won&#x27;t be productive for 2-3 months while you learn. Maybe he/she thinks you&#x27;re going to be complaining the whole time about how node.js sucks (while you forget how much cobol suck). You can alleviate this worry by having a few simply projects up in node.js or whatever the latest craze is + you have good fundamental experience.<p>So enjoy you&#x27;re travels but maybe put a minimal side project up every year or so. That&#x27;s my plan and I&#x27;d like to keep doing this developer thing for a while.

In fact, I have never met anyone that gave me the impression that they didn&#x27;t want me around. The problem is that immigration law is slow moving and the adjudicators at the USCIS need to follow it to the dot, even if it was written before a lot of the technology we use today was invented and the world was a much less global place. And now they are rolling the issue of startup founders and high skilled labor into the massive immigration reform, where it is likely to fall through the cracks or even be used as a bipartisan bargaining chip/concession.<p>Personally, I think a great way to level the playing field wrt starting businesses for immigrant founders would be to allow all holders of employment visas a grace period during which they can stay in the country after they quit their job. This grace period could depend on the type of visa, your degree, your income (read taxes), the time you spent in the US, whatever. Then you can start a business without first having to secure your own presence, which is very difficult (because you don&#x27;t yet have a real company) and expensive to do. A similar arrangement exists for study visas and is extremely effective in keeping college and grad school graduates in the country after school.",1376638207

I get where you are coming from, from a springboard perspective - allowing people a forum for chat, but the thing is these chats could be happening all over the place.<p>In the good old days, there was usenet...   and it felt nice that there was only one place to discuss say a particular subject - and meet with those interested, and specialists within that realm.   I couldn&#x27;t stand the scurge of online forums as it scattered the conversations all over the place.   And you also end up with the same conversations and realisations happening in different places.  This could be negated if you did a little online homework, and posted a link to someone elses comment that perhaps was inline with yours.   Kind of like a +1.  But hunting down other comments and trawling through forums isn&#x27;t efficient or particularly easy so I guess this isn&#x27;t really that practical.<p>Anyway the point is that these conversations are happening elsewhere all over the place.  So how do you seed/promote the piece and the ensuing conversation in the first place?   And how do others know where the conversation is taking place.   You could possibly provide  a search for backlinks to your article.<p>It&#x27;s kind of a shame that everyone doesn&#x27;t have their own blog, and within their blog they just make a comment referring to what they&#x27;ve read elsewhere, and that link becomes  available to read somehow from your article.

It couldn&#x27;t possibly be that! Anyone?<p>I&#x27;m a former NASA electrical engineer, and I can tell you it&#x27;s so. A charging electric car requires an enormous amount of energy, and a suitable charger will greatly increase household power consumption for the duration of the charging cycle.<p>The Tesla model S has two battery types, let&#x27;s use the larger battery for this example -- it has a capacity of 85  kilowatt-hours (KWh). Assuming 25% system losses, to fully charge this battery requires about 106 KWh. That translates to 8.83 kilowatts for twelve hours.<p>8.83 kilowatts at 240 volts requires about 36.9 amperes. A typical household&#x27;s electrical system can handle this current level if it&#x27;s been set up properly.<p>Okay, so for 12 hours each night, the electric car requires 240 volts at 36.9 amperes to top off its battery. How does this compare to a normal household&#x27;s power usage? Here&#x27;s an online reference:<p><a href=""http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&t=3</a><p>Q: &quot;How much electricity does an American home use?&quot;<p>A: &quot;In 2011, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 11,280 kWh ...&quot;<p>An annual usage of 11,280 KWh divided by the number of days in a year gives 30.88 KWh/day. Compare this to the daily energy required by the electric car -- 106 KWh. The bottom line is that the electric car&#x27;s power usage is about 3 1/2 times that of the remainder of the household, and a household with an electric car uses 4 1/2 times as much power as a household without an electric car.<p>Returning to the original quote:<p>> &quot;Plugging in an electric vehicle is, in some cases, the equivalent of adding three houses to the grid.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s just about right.",1376637190

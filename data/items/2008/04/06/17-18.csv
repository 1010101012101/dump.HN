They routinely ignore cases that contradict their hypothesis.<p>If they see a woman who's bad at math, they think ""aha! the stereotype is right!"". If they see a woman who's good at math, they think, ""oh well, there's bound to be exceptions"" and promptly forget about her. They only remember the ones that fit the stereotype, so the stereotype is reinforced.<p>You need to repeatedly hammer irrefutable evidence into people's heads before they'll start to forget stereotypes.",1207504704

But I think its more than just the education, I think its what our society rewards and punishes. People who want to ""change the world"" have to take a lot of risks. But yet, everything about our society (government, education, friends) seem to frown upon taking big risks and reward living safely with some 9 to 5 job.<p>For instance, there are so many pretty good programmers in my classes. Yet not one wants to start a startup or do something significant in this world. They all simply want to get a 9 to 5 job at a Google or Microsoft. Why? Probably because its so much safer to work at Google than try to create the next Google.",1207504296

If I wanted to summarize the argument of the article I would translate from newspeak to English:<p><i>We want to pay right-thinking, liberal arts majors middle class salaries for them to administer money distributions from functional people to dysfunctional people. We have no data to suggest this will help anyone, but we are pretty sure it will help ourselves.</i>",1207503623

Ancient moralists realized it; modern “mental health” professionals do, too. The behavior of poor people is often that of simple vice. It is not new, nor are the traps involved.<p>Example? Think of becoming fat: the fatter you get, the harder it is to exercise, the less incentive you have to exercise; the less you exercise, the fatter you get. You get caught in a feedback loop that spirals into imbalance and self-destruction. Sloth and gluttony (the old terms for two major causes of being overweight) are not new nor are they hard to understand.""<p>(Please note that I am not agreeing with or endorsing this opinion, merely providing a link)",1207503565

156239,comment,156177,156214,0,0,fortes,,,"Actually, that's the opposite of what the article is arguing (or to be more accurate, what the guy who the article is about is arguing).<p>Direct quote:<p><i>Reducing the number of economic hardships that the poor have to deal with actually make them more, not less, likely to work, just as repairing most of the dents on a car makes the owner more likely to fix the last couple on his own. Simply giving the poor money with no strings attached, rather than using it, as federal and state governments do now, to try to encourage specific behaviors - food stamps to make sure money doesn't get spent on drugs or non-necessities, education grants to encourage schooling, time limits on benefits to encourage recipients to look for work - would be just as effective, and with far less bureaucracy.</i><p>What you quoted was a common rebuttal to the argument above, which the guy in the article counters with:<p><i>Karelis responds that the data from that experiment is in fact quite ambiguous, and there has been debate among economists over how to interpret the results. But ultimately, he believes, the strength of his arguments is less in how they fit with the economic work that's been done to date on poverty - much of which he is suspicious of anyway - but in how familiar they feel to all of us, rich or poor.</i><p>* Edit: Formatted quotes, thought I could use Markdown.",1207503373

Instead, it's if you're in a coffee shop and you notice that your friend is in the book store 100 feet away, you can take advantage of that opportunity.  As Sam says, it's surprising how there are typically close friends in your general vicinity that you wouldn't know were there otherwise.  SMS can't replicate this behavior.",1207503269

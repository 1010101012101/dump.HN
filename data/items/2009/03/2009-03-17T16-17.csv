Even assuming that they came out linearly from day one, that would be about 1 application every couple of days.<p>Making more realistic but less provable assumptions, I would assume that Twitdom doesn't know about <i>all</i> the apps - let's say they know about 50% of them. And I would imagine that at least 80% of these apps have come out in the last two years rather than in Twitter's first year. That would mean about 800 apps in 700 days - so just over 1 app a day.<p>Which is about 10 apps a week. Good guess.",1237308964

A quick (very quick) bit of research looks like they're part startup and part experiment in terms of investing in the robotics space overall.<p>Most of what they're doing is work, not invention, so they <i>should</i> be on the cheaper end of the spectrum.  They still likely have a relatively high BOM and a ton of tooling costs for custom parts and such.  Additionally, they're going to have to spend a lot of money on PR, tradeshows, and demo equipment to get it anywhere near viable (assuming it is meant to be more startup than experiment).<p>It's also too soon to tell, a small bit of fate could swing something like that wildly in either direction.<p>If anybots were a true stand-alone startup (and for all I know, they very well could be), I'd put that at around a $20M net (aAB rounds) investment to get chugging.  Could highly likely need a C round to scale out, depending on distribution model (do you buy them online, at Best Buy, or both?).",1237308963

Most of them, incidentally, are not very good at it. The sample base is small though, so it might be skewed.<p>Also, in my opinion a lot of them are ""aha"" questions - once you get them they're obvious. They don't require deductive thinking, but rather that you ""get"" this particular question. A good example of this might be ""Why are manhole covers round?"" The answer is that round covers are bigger than the hole no matter how you turn them, and thus can't fall in. It's hard to deduct your way to this conclusion, yet once you get it it's obvious.<p>Questions such as ""how many pianos are there in New York?"" require a bit more deductive thinking, but I'm sceptical as to how much they say about someones ability to code.<p>But, as you point out, if there's a correlation, hoowever small, and you get other loosely correlated data it adds up.",1237308663

The event loop, time and again, has been shown to truly shine for a high number of low activity connections. In comparison, a blocking IO model with threads or processes has been shown, time and again, to cut down latency on a per-request basis compared to an event loop. On a lightly loaded system the difference is indistinguishable. Under load, most event loops choose to slow down, most blocking models choose to shed load.<p>A few short years ago the benefits from using an event loop instead of blocking io were much more dramatic -- the level of parallelism achievable in hardware has gone way up (hey, look, erlang!) and is accelerating.

520076,comment,519928,519999,0,0,raganwald,,,"Yes. And no.<p>Take yourself back to 1989 or so when very few companies asked brain teaser questions so therefore there were very few people who studied brain teasers specifically to ace job interviews. The question for an interviewer was whether being good at brain teasers <i>correlated</i> to being good at a programming job in a statistically significant manner. Now combine that with a number of other interview techniques, each of which correlates well and you may have had something.<p>If you must search for reasons and meanings, it was probably because the kind of people who studied brain teasers for fun also happened to have a certain knack for the math-y problem-solving part of programming. Or they actually enjoyed solving problems for fun. Or both. I am not suggesting that we need to prove that the skill of solving a brain teaser was an important programming skill, it could be there was a root talent which expressed itself in programming and brain teaser abilities simultaneously. Or that some event in their past opened them up to learning two different and unrelated skills. All that mattered was whether you could measure a correlation.<p>But  that was then. Today, I avoid such questions entirely. However, that is because IMO it no longer correlates well. Mostly because it has become popular enough that interviewees game the system by swotting up on brain teasers, so being good at them no longer means you have innate talent for math-y problem solving, nor does it mean you enjoy solving problems for fun.<p>So in summary I say that being good at brainteaser problems in a job interview no longer even proves that you're good at brain teaser problems, or like solving them for fun, but I disagree that it has never conveyed useful information to an interviewer.",1237307278

At that point in time, Linode had their 400MB instances for $80 (which became 512 which became 1024 which became 1200 which became 1440 over the years).  Slicehost had just been founded at the same time EC2 came around and I remember the big waiting list as they became popular.<p>So, I don't think that Amazon can become dominant unless it offers more for less.  Their EBS (elastic block storage) is a good offering that's really attractive, but they're starting to look expensive.  Slicehost will give me an 8GB box with 2TB of transfer for $450.  Amazon would cost $628 for that (40% more).  Even if you commit to a 3-year term and pay $2,000 up-front, you still only bring the cost down to $500.<p>It will really depend on whether Amazon keeps prices down.  Their competitors will have the ability to lower prices as hardware improves. If Amazon doesn't follow suit, they won't last.  Right now, there aren't too many providers, but Xen knowledge is getting out there and more companies will start offering the same thing.<p>Amazon is doing well now.

520059,comment,516949,519148,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think my hatred for Harry Potter isn't completely because of the fact that I hate the series. I believe it comes more from the fact that the English school system proposed placing it on the national curriculum's book list and were planning to remove either Of Mice and Men or The Lord of the Flies. Thankfully they completely changed this, allowing teachers to teach whatever books they want as long as they were established texts, which included Harry Potter.<p>I believe the rest of my distaste for the series came from when the books were initially released. There was such hype over a <i>kids</i> book and in my free time I was reading many of the sci-fi classics, and when I finally got to reading Harry Potter it was just an extremely campy version of Ender's Game. I believe even Orson Scott Card (who's a fan of Harry Potter) pointed this out when J.K. Rowling targeted her own fans for the Harry Potter lexicon for 'stealing her ideas'.<p>I'm fully aware of all that's wrong with the Twilight novels, but it never really bothered me and I've generally avoided books written in first person. However, I came from the UK so I never read or heard anything until I was ambushed into reading it by my (then fiancee) wife, I'd given her like my favorite book of all time to read <i>The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin</i> and she gave me Twilight, which wasn't exactly a fair trade: 200 page book at like 4x5 vs 500 page at 5x7. Then, of course, the movie came out and her friend just <i>happened</i> to have extra tickets for the opening night. I believe that's the easiest I've ever been tricked.<p>Although, rather ironically, I believe I've contributed more money to Rowling and the Harry Potter series as I have watched most of the movies and eventually actually paid to see the most recent one, and I've yet to give a penny to Mayer.",1237306773

They are not ""preprogarmmed"" into the chess engines (at least I have never seen one since the late 90s).<p>For UCI protocol the openbooks and TB are handled by the GUI - with an option to not use them. Same with the winboard protocol engine - but the engines handle the opening book and TB with the option to not use them if configured. Nothing is pre-programmed.<p>Opening book is the combination of best moves in the opening stages of the game taken from 1000s of games played by human players. Chess engine uses them to ""minimize"" the error in opening position. They can beat even the best grandmaster without opening book.<p>End-game Tablebases are every possible combination of moves at the end of the game. Currently only 3-4-5-6 pieces TBs are available (a combination of ~1.6 Terabyte of data).<p>Again, nothing is pre-programmed. Using them gives them an advantage of ~30-40 ELo points, which means little when you are already 300-500 elo points stronger than the strongest human opponent (fair guestimation IMO)<p>EDIT: Just realized you wrote ""reprogrammed"" not ""preprogrammed"", not sure what do you mean by ""between rounds"" and ""Cheating"". Most strong chess programs are binary builds and most of them use popular protocols like UCI and Winboard to handle GUI functions and everything is automated so I am kinda confused by the ""reprogrammed"" part.",1251399431

The reason doctors don't treat it, is because you're safer to have latent toxoplasmosis than none at all, not only can it lead to miscarriages in women, but the chance of encephalitis increases with decreased immune function. So if you get toxoplasmosis when you're healthy, like most people, you'll be fine, but if doctors go around curing it you'll get reinfected and seriously increase your risk for <i>death</i>.<p>Ironically the mild production of Monoamine Oxidase A is known for a decrease in danger-seeking behaviour, but extreme production (witnessed in people with the Warrior Gene) is known for an increase in danger-seeking behaviour. Toxoplasmosis apparently acts like the warrior gene for mice, but will in fact likely prolong the life of a human infected with latent toxoplasmosis.",1251398559

Some background: I was partially raised in government housing as a child, had parents who were drug and alcohol abusers, and was never encouraged to do anything intellectually stimulating while growing up.  I lived in a poor mixed raced city and attended a mostly nonwhite high school.  Learning was never a concern of mine while in high school, not getting my face smashed in was (which happened).<p>I was not in an environment for intellectual growth, nor was I in an environment that would have indicators of high IQ.<p>Through pure luck, I had a high school teacher that somewhat set me on the right course.  For half a day, two years long, I had this teacher for a CAD class.  He told me attitude was everything and encouraged me to enroll in college.  My first two years weren't great.  I struggled in classes like algebra.  I also didn't know how to study.<p>After two years of getting nowhere, I moved to a large US city as a result of certain life circumstances.  I finished up my undergraduate degree and took a year off.  I didn't feel very happy though.  I wanted to get a graduate degree.  My company was willing to pay for it, as long as I worked 40 hours a week and made good grades.  It was a complete change for me, kind of a fresh start.  I decided I would take the university serious.  Because my undergrad wasn't computer science, I had to complete all of the undergrad computer science courses.  So I had at least four years ahead of me to get my masters.<p>Only because I worked really hard and studied a lot, I would often be the top performer in my 3 calculus classes, discrete math, and so on (this wasn't always the case... but hey, I was working a full-time job too).  I ended up with a masters in computer science, something I never thought was possible for me.<p>Something that inspired me was that I'd see the international students (mostly east Asian and Indian) study very hard.  They would study all day long in the library.  They seemed like the very definition of self-discipline.

789698,comment,789559,789559,0,0,haseman,,,"I've had success in asking for a raise with a technique that breaks down into two parts:<p>First, frame the issue as a problem for you.  A problem your bosses can help you with: I.E. your unhappy about the mismatch between your salary and your responsibilities.  You leave step one when your bosses agree with you that it's a problem.  I'd try to stay away from specific numbers and focus on your needs/feelings.  Be general, talk about how others in your area are paid more, but shy away from exactly how much.  This allows your manager to 'help' you with your problem without a commitment to what the 'help' might look like.  Bosses _love_ to be helpful.<p>Second, once they admit that there is a problem, you can start talking about a solution.  Remember, your bosse's hands may be tied with rules about max raises, bonus schedules, review cycles, and other such crap the corporate world throws in front of good bosses.  So, before hand, figure out what solutions you'd be willing to accept.  Maybe a deferred raise, bonus, more vacation, less work hours for the same pay.  Try to be as flexible and honest as you can.  The second stage is your time to start talking about specifics, but try to accommodate the limitations placed on your boss.  That said, do your homework, if your boss is lying to you, don't call them out, just get ready to walk.<p>Last, be prepared to quit.  It's hard to talk about how unhappy you are at your job if you haven't thought about alternatives.  If it goes well you won't have to leave, but it's good to go into the discussion with the confidence that you could quit if you had to.<p>Good luck!",1251396768

Does Canada create the same &#x27;value&#x27; as India?  The notion seems preposterous, as how can a country 1/35th the size of another produce the same value - the author directly questions what &#x27;value&#x27; is, as a measurement of something called &#x27;productivity&#x27;.  The entire article is a critique of what productivity is.<p>> The nation with the longest life expectancy is the workaholic Japanese culture so disparaged by the author!<p>It is not disparaged, quite the opposite.  The author highlights that Japan measures (again, a theme of measurement) the number of deaths by overwork, and pretty explicitly and bluntly states that some other countries do not (and sarcastically concludes it must therefore not exist in those countries).<p>>  Measuring and quantifying something is a prerequisite to optimizing it. Maybe a lot of people are measuring the wrong things.<p>I agree.  I believe the author is questioning what needs to be optimised and what is optimal.  Before that, measurement has no scope, and what is currently optimised for &#x27;productivity&#x27; may not be productive (excuse my pun).",1415620797

8583057,comment,8582175,8582364,0,0,aaronem,,,"> One is a full EMV track read transaction and the other is not.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that can be true; loading a card into Apple Pay is done via photo or manually, neither of which entails a swipe of the card through something like a Square reader, which is what would be necessary for Apple Pay to provide &quot;full EMV track read&quot; data. The information available via Apple Pay is therefore necessarily a proper subset of that encoded into the magstripe, which, according to the Visa rep&#x27;s statement, should require that Apple Pay transactions be billed under the same card-not-present fee scheme as in-app purchases and online transactions.<p>Your argument from packet format is irrelevant; &quot;user interaction points&quot; don&#x27;t enter into it, under the rules defined and promulgated by the card associations. Those rules include a distinction between card-present and card-not-present transactions, made on the basis of whether or not the transaction data includes a full and valid magstripe read. Apple Pay transactions <i>cannot</i> include such a read, because, based on the methods by which a card can be enrolled in Apple Pay by its user, the information available at transaction time <i>cannot</i> be other than a proper subset of what a magstripe read would provide.<p>It&#x27;s understandable that WalMart&#x27;s Cook should be cross over this; his irritation stems from the perception that &quot;the fix is in&quot; between Apple and the card associations, such that they&#x27;re breaking their own rules to give preferential treatment to Apple Pay.<p>On the other hand, these are <i>their</i> rules; the conditions under which various transaction fee schemes apply are defined entirely by the card associations (Visa and MasterCard, et al.), and if they want to extend preferential treatment in this fashion, then it&#x27;s entirely within their scope to do so.<p>In effect, the rule for a card-present transaction has been extended with a clause &quot;...or if it&#x27;s done by Apple Pay&quot;. This is a special case of a more general rule under which effectively all card association operations occur, and whose most concise formulation is &quot;Because we say so.&quot;",1415620449

Most of the times I just run an upgrade-script on a tmux session and everything runs smoothly (I rarely use pre-compiled packages).<p>Now, if I had a production-level web application, I would probably set-up as carefully as I could a new VPS and roll my application there, up to the point where I needed to <i>scale</i>.<p>If it would be a one-man-show I&#x27;d probably go with Heroku (since I write sinatra/ruby/rails applications) or similar (possible cheaper) service to avoid spending time on sys-admin.

8582996,comment,8578151,8580474,0,0,Quequau,,,"Actually, I have.  I understand that there is complex tension between fundamental human rights (like freedom of expression, freedom of association, & privacy) and realities of the intrusion & abridgment of these rights carried out by various state security agencies and corporations.<p>I agree that any project which claims &quot;impossible to be subverted by centralized governments&quot; is just saying &quot;come and try to stop me, Federales&quot;.  Moreover, I feel that such claims are extremely difficult to substantiate (and so not particularly credible) and for the most part made by groups I&#x27;m not really motivated to associate myself with.<p>Speaking in a very general sense (having kept up with the news & goings on related to technology, privacy, corporate activities, and state security activities for the past few decades); it&#x27;s my opinion that this tension is not only not in an ethically defensible or sustainable state, it&#x27;s not in the state that most of the people in the western capitalist nations believe & expect it is.<p>So I find assertions like: &quot;Despite messages between ships being encrypted, the founders state that they&#x27;ve purposely designed the network to make it as easy as possible for governments to regulate and control. It&#x27;s not entirely clear why this is supposed to be a good thing.&quot; to be similarly worthy of skepticism and disconcerting as the &quot;impossible to be subverted by centralized governments&quot; claims.  My feeling is that this statement translates fairly directly into &quot;all user data is available to any corporate entity or state security agency for any purpose&quot; and that this includes purposes like backchannel monetization through data aggregation and industrial scale warrantless surveillance & data collection.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious to me that you are pretty invested in this project and I&#x27;ve only spent a few hours perusing the various docs, repositories, and blogs.  So I&#x27;m fairly hesitant to make any sweeping statements or claims of certainty.  So, with those qualifications in mind, my conclusion after my perusal is that this architectural design choice is unlikely to be a reflection of some sort of pragmatic policy coming from a non-ideological position of social responsibility that&#x27;s striving to minimize any intrusion & abridgment of rights while still allowing for the realistic needs of businesses and state security agencies.<p>Frankly spoken, I personally find a number of the abstract concepts and architectural design choices in Urbit project to be fascinating and compelling.  I&#x27;ve spent far too much time dredging around the information that is currently publicly available... Time I honestly can&#x27;t afford. So it&#x27;s really disappointing to me to find that there is a pervasive toxicity which is deeply intertwined with the project. My conclusion is that this toxicity makes the project broadly unusable (seriously) & and possibly even unfixable.<p>Elsewhere in this thread I saw someone claim that there were big things coming in a few months.  If this is accurate I look forward to it.  Perhaps there will be changes and new developments which will demonstrate my current assessment inaccurate.  Honestly, that would make me pretty happy... but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I suspect that&#x27;s really, really unlikely.",1415619135

I don&#x27;t need vim to me more configurable. Just a few weeks ago I looked into vim plugins for the third time into my vim history, but again I found it unnecesary. Most plugins don&#x27;t improve at all what I want to do with vim.<p>Examples: Prettier status line? Don&#x27;t need it. Tree view of my project? Don&#x27;t need it, or I use the shell command called tree. Autocomplete? I started learning the APIs of the tools I use because it makes my writing code better and much, much faster. Therefore I don&#x27;t need that anymore. Git integration? Why would I want that? &quot;:!git&quot; is fine. The sorround plugin would be an idea, but it&#x27;s key usage is strange in my eyes.<p>Not spending this time into individualization and instead using this time to learn more about vim has significantly increased my code generation and allows me more easily to work on other systems with the same efficiency as on my own.<p>If you have some real arguments for plugins I am really, really curious to learn what they are. But please consider before writing if spending the same time into learning how to solve your problem with vim capabilities would not be the better and faster approach.",1415618992

Now a lot of discussions stops with saying the tooling  isn&#x27;t good enough and noone should ever use the new database solutions.",1415618110

Through OS X and iOS, Apple&#x27;s UI ethos became the gold standard in UI design. It was so well designed that it was easy to imitate and by simply adopting the core elements of Apples UI language, stuff became intuitive and usable without the designer needing to understand &quot;why&quot; something looked the way it looked.<p>And then came a new trend, the current trend, that appears to me to be rooted in nothing more substantial than a desire to replace the old with something new at all costs. And when the likes of Apple and Google fall for the same trap, it&#x27;s nigh on impossible for fundamental UI design knowledge to make itself heard above the noise of a million designers advocating the new and pointing to Apple for credibility.<p>You can see that I don&#x27;t like Material. I also don&#x27;t like iOs&#x27;s new UI language. It doesn&#x27;t work.

Facebook is extremely entrenched now, and there's little to no incentive to users to opt-in to something else.  To attack the power of Facebook/Twitter, this was really the only way of doing it (although I agree, perhaps a Labs feature would have been a better way of introducing the concept for a couple of months at first).",1266184694

There's not a single question here on the parenthetical sideswipe that teamwork is “vastly overrated”.<p>There is some business wisdom about having a backbone in some areas that trip many small companies up, but when I got to the ""vendor financing"" remark, my judgement of this man was much harsher than ""penny ante"" as his tough love jumped the shark for a splash landing on shifting-the-burden.<p>My financial discipline is my vendor's financial shame.

Though some of the points the author makes are valid (esp having the ""Email this"" link so prominent), to extrapolate so far as to call the entirety of Buzz dead on arrival is ridiculous. As I've already said elsewhere on HN, Buzz has had a horrible rollout that cost Google a serious amount of goodwill, but the product itself has a lot going for it.<p>Sure, there may be problems, but they've already shown that they are willing to fix them. Next to search itself, Gmail is probably their single-largest profit center, so if they take the bold step of integrating Buzz into Gmail, that can only indicate a long-term commitment to making the service work. In short, no, Buzz is not dead already. It's getting off to a less than stellar start, but it's very far from dead.",1266184159

But that said, choosing splats as your example of bad syntax isn't the best choice, because there isn't a syntactic equivalent in JavaScript.<p>This CoffeeScript:<p><pre><code>    send_letter: (name, addresses...) ->
      # more code...
</code></pre>
Where the array of addresses can be referenced and used as many times as you like within the function body, would need to be translated as this JavaScript:<p><pre><code>    var send_letter = function send_letter(name) {
      var addresses = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1);
      # more code...
    };
</code></pre>
Which is both a good bit more to type, as well as more work -- you need to figure out the index from which to slice.

Update: Actually, even more intriguing, why is the stack shifted by 100 bytes for the a() function??? I would have expected it to be 72, as it was for the main() function, ie 64 bytes for the ar[16] and then 8 bytes for the two registers that are pushed onto the stack.<p>Sigh.

I would say that you need a certain level of dpi to handle small font rendering well. After a certain threshold I don't know if it benefits you as much. The second factor is screen size the n770 had a 4.1"" screen which leads to a lot of context switches. The kindle has 167ppi on a 6"" screen. The kindle screen allows for much less context switches which are jarring to the mind. (context switch in this example would be turning the page) With the iPad's 10"" screen the context switches will be much less even still.

I'm not saying you should pull all your data and buy a tarp and a shovel. But consider a few things.<p>Google didn't set out to be evil or clumsy in this case. They created the product with the best of intentions: to improve your connections with your network, and as a result make that network (that they host) more valuable to them. I'm sure ""win-win"" was probably said in more than one conference room.<p>But they made a number of mistakes, in implementation and in rollout. Most of the mistakes were minor, but amplified by ""the millions that have signed up with Buzz!"" A few mistakes were serious and possibly dangerous to a smaller number of people.

The constraints of a startup environment may justify such desires.<p>2) Risk-aversion - many of us in enterprise environments groan about all of the meetings, deferments of decisions to superiors / domain experts, and other risk-avoidance strategies, but in the end we like our butts covered just like everyone else.<p>3) Tolerance / preference for a certain amount of friction - some might call this a lack of urgency or an excess of complacency.

An entire country suffering from poor pension investments all at once could have disasterous consequences.<p>My understanding of the typical pension opt-in change is that it opts you in to your company&#x27;s default pension rather than a state default pension, so the nation as a whole would have diversification even if customers of some pension providers are at risk (unless that nation didn&#x27;t have diverse pension providers, in which case they already have a problem). Could be wrong, not my area.<p>Issue (b) is interesting too. I&#x27;d say it fell into my third group because it seems to rest on people being lulled into a false sense of security and then taken advantage of.

Nudge units on the whole use a tiny subset of the psychological arsenal that companies use daily. They only use the stuff there&#x27;s clear scientific evidence for ploughing on layers of gamification, incentives, information assymetry, etc. Yet companies do not feel bound by Richard Thalers &quot;3 laws of nudging&quot;, they rarely follow more than 1. That&#x27;s fair enough, as it&#x27;s harder to switch to a different government and governments have more power over us, but it does raise the question... if our decision making skills atrophy over time then that would have already happened with companies, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen evidence to support that view.

The captured light information is then processed in whatever necessary way depending on the capture mechanism to ultimately produce a photograph. But all that&#x27;s produced is one, singular photograph, that&#x27;s an exact mapping of the physical properties of the lens system.<p>Computational photography tries to virtualise aspects of this process by modelling the system&#x27;s optics, so that extra information can be inferred from the captured light using these models. This extra information can reveal things about the scene being captured (more the computer vision side) or be used to post-process different effects into the image after the fact in an intelligent way that uses real information about the scene (more the photography, art, side) such that the captured information represents a space of possible images of the scene, rather than just one singular point in that space (one photograph).<p>To increase the quality and quantity of this information, extra sensors, better sensors, different sensors (light field capture etc) are used, and modifications to the system can be made such as coded apertures, adjusting parameters like focal length and exposure time by known amounts, and collecting samples over a range of these modifications. Looks like a coded aperture is used in this technique for example but this article doesn&#x27;t go into a lot of detail on that.<p>When you start thinking about the possibilities of working with image &#x27;spaces&#x27; instead of photographs, both for practical computer vision applications and just plain cool art applications, it quickly becomes obvious what a fascinating and exciting (and important) field this is, and will be in the future.<p>It&#x27;s really, truly, awesome to see an application of this relatively new field of research which could hit the mainstream in a big way - namely thinner, lighter, solid state cameras in phones, which it looks like this research could ultimately lead to.

I believe that most startups with Machine Learning teams are doing more than just calling R-libraries; most development work that I&#x27;ve done for myself and teams has been for tooling and operationalizing data infrastructure (i.e. data engineering, not data science). However if you need a simple recommendation for an app then calling the library methods without 100% understanding may be enough (but calling library methods without underlying understanding is a bad trait in a programmer (e.g. calling the sort() function without understanding quicksort)).",1449603520

It was nicely portable, had good battery life, could do a lot of things well, but I just couldn&#x27;t find any apps I liked for two things I do often: ssh and creating presentations.  One ssh app could do tunnels, but got all confused if I tried to open multiple terminal sessions.  Another handled multiple sessions OK, but couldn&#x27;t do tunnels.  Then the two would interfere with one another if I tried to run both simultaneously.  For presentations, many couldn&#x27;t do something as basic as keep track of where my cursor was, and would add text at the wrong place.  Others at least worked, but couldn&#x27;t do anything more complex than a bullet list.

Optimizing to minimize the cost of hiring an early engineer is definitely solving the wrong problem, given the early engineers are almost as crucial to success as founders.  Unfortunately, hit rate is also often the wrong variable from the company end: if you interview an academic programmer to confirm their product programming skills you generally get someone better with a larger skill set than if you focus in the category you want for the skills you want (early-stage you generally want breadth over depth for many roles).

Whereas a big company would hire directly in the USA, in Brazil they&#x27;ll use one of the Brazilian recruiting firms and pay a large fee. And professionals (such as programmers) will browse the recruiting firm&#x27;s site and won&#x27;t think to apply directly to the company.<p>- Brazilians are unlikely to invite a stranger they met (over the Internet, by phone, or even in person) into their home. Even if the person is a professional business contact. In Canada/USA, people are much more open to inviting a business contact into their home.

10698628,comment,10698009,10698244,0,0,rowborg,,,"I posted this as a comment on the original post, but will make the point here...<p>Large organizations are often more dysfunctional than small ones, yes, especially when it comes to building software. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t filled with very smart people. The fact that enterprise programmers can&#x27;t get hired at startups is not, in my opinion, a reflection of the dysfunctional nature of software development at large companies, but of a mismatch in expectations about how to communicate your ability to do your job.<p>As an example: one pattern I’ve seen that consistently holds enterprise programmers back in startup interviews (especially in phone screens and technical screens) is the inability to effectively articulate the projects they’ve worked on. Enterprise programmers have often worked on optimizing one small part of a very large and complex system that no one person may understand completely, and in my experience, they often cannot describe that system clearly or holistically. Startups usually need people who can build a system end-to-end, and when an enterprise programmer doesn’t seem to understand their own projects, it reflects very poorly. I see this pattern way too often.<p>My suggestion (and obviously this is a gross generalization) is for enterprise programmers who want to work at startups to practice being able to clearly and consisely explain what they worked on and how it fit into the overall product. Startups will care more about this than showing, for example, a deep understanding of how Java&#x27;s various memory pools work (even if they work in Java).",1449601999

That’s a nice proposition. On the other hand, it’s an admission on Apple’s part that the battery performance on iPhone 6 or 6S is a pain point for power users.<p>Limit the battery size so people have to buy an external battery pack, reduce the connectors so people have to buy adaptors; so apple can make more money, and the cost of ownership goes up for &quot;optional&quot; add ons.<p>That they would create a separate device, instead of reverse course on battery sizes in the devices themselves, is a brazen admission that their design is flawed. And it doesn&#x27;t even get the device to 100%!! So even their solution to the original design flaw is flawed. amazing.<p>Design is all about tradeoffs, and if apple never made any tradeoffs on their laptops they would still be an inch thick and weigh 10 pounds. But on the other side, there is profit driven design where additional revenue generators are invented surrounding a device, either through new technology (good) or the removal or hinderance of existing functionality (bad).

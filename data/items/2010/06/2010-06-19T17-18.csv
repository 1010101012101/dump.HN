The same technology that lets the guy send a fax from the beach allows him to make calls from almost anywhere, (even video conferencing if you have an Evo or similar phone) pushing the phone booth out of common use.

However, when I first started living here, all I had to do was slide over my business card.  The logo on it implies ""This man will be no problem for you.  He is of the finest character or he would never work here.  If he is hospitalized, our CEO will walk his rent to your door and apologize for the inconvenience.  Should you have any other issue with him, one call to us and he will wish he had been hospitalized.  Guaranteed by the good name -- and virtually limitless capital reserves -- of $COMPANY.""<p>Salarymen do not typically make a lot of money, but in a very status-conscious society, salarymen at particularly well-known companies didn't just draw a high card, we drew a straight flush.  And we've got the next best thing to a signed promise from God Almighty that that status will never degrade in any material fashion.<p>I was once introduced to the mother of a young day I was seeing at the time.  She was less than enthusiastic about me, mostly because of the one inalterable way in which I will never be ideal Japanese husband material.  However, when I mentioned what I did for a living, you could practically see the gears turn in her head:  ""My grandchildren will go to only the best grade schools.  They will always have enough money to pay for cram school.  They will test into the best high schools, then universities, and then they will get jobs as salarymen just like their father and they will be set for life.  Don't let him get away!""

1. Drag and Drop - many inexperienced users find drag and drop difficult so killing it wouldn't harm anyone. It always was a bitch with overlapping windows anyway.<p>2. Managing overlapping windows in general just sucks. I've often argued that tiling windows are a much better idea and these could be made to work on touch devices with larger screens too.<p>3. Scrollbars are useless on touch-devices and not much fun on the desktop. Luckily touchpad scrolling and mouse-wheels mean I don't have to use them much so maybe they can die too.<p>4. 'Hover' type interactions are usually inessential. and when they aren't it's usually a sign that something is horribly wrong with the UX<p>Maybe even with touchpad/mouse/keyboard, the changes made necessary by touch devices might force desktop UI's to shed some of their weaker aspects.<p>Another thing to think about is the '10 foot interface'.

Had the aha! moment when I figured out what was happening. The best solution I could find was to keep on assigning the event handlers whenever I added something to the DOM.<p>It served me well but Rebecca just taught me that there is something called $.fn.live and $.fn.delegate designed solve exactly this problem. This I would not have searched in the docs because I did'nt know that there existed something to solve this; and even if I thought there did, I might not have been able to frame the right question.<p>And there are lots of other gems that I picked up from this book.. jQuery really needs this.

1445014,comment,1444390,1444390,0,0,georgieporgie,,,"My thoughts on 'karma' or simple up/down rating systems:<p>A few years ago, I discovered a site called Reddit.  After awhile, I realized there were comments on the site, and began reading them.  While a few added to my enjoyment and understanding of the articles, I have to admit that what really attracted me were the pun threads.<p>Well, I thought I would attempt this interesting variety of interaction.  I began to post my thoughts on subjects.  I was surprised to see that my well thought-out comments were getting downvoted.  Sometimes quite strongly.<p>Hmm...  I reexamined my arguments and how I conveyed them.  I experimented with different ways of expressing myself.  However, most of the time when I made a comment which I thought was a bit insightful, I would see negative karma.<p>Finally, I changed my approach.  Instead of thinking about a subject and writing what I thought of it, I instead peppered the site with knee-jerk, humorous comments.<p>My greatest success, by the way, was a one-line ""your mom"" joke which earned me something like 270 karma for a couple of seconds' work.<p>I found the worst problem to be in the subreddits.  As I quickly learned, subreddits are inhabited by people who want their views validated.  Even correcting dangerous misconceptions around basic physics would get harsh downvotes.  Meanwhile, comments which perpetuated the status quo of ignorance were celebrated.<p>Up/down community rating does not provide any sort of legitimacy to posters.  It only provides popularity.  As one who doesn't take political advice from movie stars (for example), I find it appalling that this system is spreading.<p>As for the specifics of downvoting repeatedly, this is simple lynch mob mentality.  A -1 rating has just as much power to say, ""we don't like the way you express yourself,"" as a -10 rating.  The only thing that -10 adds is a reflection of groupthink and people venting angst.",1276969303

9553886,comment,9553168,9553754,0,0,gh02t,,,"It&#x27;s OK. Debugging is doable, but it&#x27;s a bit awkward IMO. In terms of discoverability, well generally the documentation is among the best you will find anywhere and it&#x27;s all inter-linked and full of examples, so that&#x27;s a strong point. You can build programs with state, it mostly a functional language but it doesn&#x27;t enforce purity or anything.<p>It is certainly capable enough that building something like what you&#x27;re describing wouldn&#x27;t be hard, but my experience is that it really isn&#x27;t that great for that kind of usage (part of this is the readability, more on that in a sec). I think of it more as a &quot;query&quot; language... I tend to find that it works best if you use it by building up a few fundamental entities (say, symbolic equations or data) and then analyze them (transform data, plot, solve equations etc). In this usage it&#x27;s pretty amazing, but whenever I try to do something like in a &quot;real&quot; programming language it is miserable. For instance, I once implemented GMRES in it and jeez it was absolutely miserable. On the other hand, I can do pure wizardry with stuff like data processing and visualization.<p>Basically, as long as you stick to composition of built-in functions, it&#x27;s wonderful. When you want to do something from scratch though, that&#x27;s when the suffering starts. It&#x27;s also really easy to shoot yourself in the foot performance-wise... the language is very flexible in terms of allowing many different programming styles. Typically, however, only the functional-style implementation is really performant. For instance, you can use traditional indexed loops just fine, but their performance is generally at least an order of magnitude slower.<p>One other thing that drives me nuts about it is readability. It suffers from the same issue as Lisps with parenthesis overload, except for WL it&#x27;s all braces and square brackets. If you put in good spacing and let the autoindent do its thing then it is pretty readable, but a lot of people don&#x27;t. Somebody elsewhere linked this image <a href=""http://indiegames.com/2014/03/10/wolfram%20example.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indiegames.com/2014/03/10/wolfram%20example.jpg</a> , which is a pretty good example of how it can be really awful. And writing code that looks like that is pretty widespread in the community, though it has gotten better in the past couple years.<p>Tl;dr I think it&#x27;s pretty sweet, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it for what you ask for.

This is to get people talking about auto scaling with containers and to build what we learn into the scheduler.<p>I definitely agree that there is a place for auto scaling both VMs and containers. Auto scaling with VMs means if it takes several minutes to add a VM to the cluster you have to scale up early and scale down slowly. We think auto scaling with containers can help a lot here by smoothing out the demand. Lower priority containers can be stopped while extra VM capacity is added.",1431726399

You can think of hydrogen as the scrawny kid that gets pushed around by all the larger atoms, and oxygen as the bully that always takes his lunch money (the electron).  Whenever the environment is energetic enough to ionize one hydrogen, the result is like the tea party in Alice in Wonderland.  The hydrogens switch seats, and just end up drinking the same tea out of broken teacups.<p>The theory here is that if you make some hydrogens less scrawny (deuterium), the other atoms will preferentially pick on the lighter hydrogens, avoiding the destruction of the really important hydrogen-bearing molecules, like the fats in cell membranes.<p>Sounds good so far.  But what happens when the fat needs to be recycled, or the deuterium swaps out to a different molecule?<p>Replacing 50% of a mammal&#x27;s hydrogen with deuterium will cause the animal to die, from symptoms resembling radiation sickness, because spindle formation in mitosis relies upon Van der Waals forces, which are reduced in deuterium-containing molecules.<p>We aren&#x27;t actually sure what else might go wrong in selectively deuterating the human body.

Assuming their claim of 1/1,000~ is anywhere near remotely true - then you may have increased your chances of finding a &#x27;good match&#x27; tenfold already with the assumption that matches will be good (there is of course the chance they won&#x27;t be)<p>The Myers-Briggs places weight on questions to give one of the 16 personality types made of 8 traits. For example, one answer might give you 80% of INTJ and 20% INTP and by factoring the weights across all the questions will tell you if you were weighted more or less towards INTJ or INTP, even if you were more INTJ for that singular question.<p>In 8x8 the questions are not weighted in that way, which is an important difference. While there are 16 distinct personality traits in MBTI, there are only 8 traits. Questions can weigh towards those 8 traits in various ways. From my experience MBTI tests range from the 5 &quot;strongly, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly&quot; answer types and the questions are targeted to 2 (sometimes 4, but typically 2) traits.<p>Meaning if neutral is 50% : 50% (Not leaning towards introvert or extrovert) your answer to the question is effectively meaningless. However if you &quot;agree&quot; it might be 75% : 25% and if you &quot;strongly agree&quot; it could be 100% : 0%. You take the aggravated ratings of all the &quot;I or E&quot; type questions and determine if the user is introverted or extroverted based on which holds more weight across 50 questions.<p>8x8 does not weight the questions to determine personality traits. The questions must match <i>exactly</i> to determine a match. In comparison, Myers-Briggs can have two people be INTJ who answered questions very differently but their aggregated weights of each question added up to them both being an INTJ.<p>Again: this should be treated as a case study. Since questions aren&#x27;t weighted, this is different than most personality tests. This isn&#x27;t a personality test - but finding someone who thinks <i>exactly</i> as you do in regards to these 8 questions.<p>The largest flaw is if these are the wrong 8 questions to ask and if matches lean towards &quot;good&quot; or not. Which can be determined after enough matches. Making this a neat <i>case study</i>. :)<p>E:<p>TL;DR If 12,000 people took a MBTI I guarantee there would be many matches already. This isn&#x27;t a personality test - this is a line of thinking test. Whether the questions will result in good matches or not will be left to when there are any matches to begin with.",1431725780

The rent figure given is for having your own one bedroom apartment with no roommates, the food figure is hilariously overstated ($242/month), transportation assumes a pretty new car or very long commutes ($306/month). These figures simply are not realistic for a lower class individual.<p>I am living a lower class lifestyle right now as I type this. I live in a shared home with 2 other people. I drive an older but reliable car I purchased for $2.2k cash (a luxury expense, I could have kept taking the bus/biking to work).

Of course it&#x27;s all hypotheticals, but since we - for the most part - define government as that entity which has (mostly) a monopoly on the use of force, a private company would not generally be considered empowered to do that without the sanction of a government.<p><i>Or are you saying that, without government regulation, the East India company wouldn&#x27;t have formed their own private army?</i><p>Correct.<p><i>Do you think private armed militias, that are legal today in the US, be allowed to exist?</i><p>Of course they can <i>exist</i>.  Now, of course, we&#x27;re at the bottom of the stack, so to speak.  What if one of these private militias &quot;goes rogue&quot; and commits unspeakable atrocities?  Who&#x27;s to stop that, right? And I guess your answer would be &quot;the government&quot;?  I&#x27;d argue that the answer is &quot;some other voluntarily assembled mutual defense entity, or no one&quot;.  Anyway, all we&#x27;ve really shown here is that if you drill down deep enough, human conflict is inevitable and at some level we may never get away from &quot;force vs force&quot;.   But I argue against <i>institutionalizing</i> the idea of using force to compel people to do things, and keep the use of force reserved for self defense.<p><i>You&#x27;re going to have to reconcile your position of &quot;less government&quot; with &quot;leads to more private armies&quot;.</i><p>I&#x27;m not opposed to private armies in general.  I&#x27;m opposed to private armies, operating with the sanction of the State, and essentially becoming one more arm of the government, and being used to violate people&#x27;s rights.  Or, you could even omit the &quot;with the sanction of the State&quot; bit, and the rest would still stand.  The problem is, when we accept the presence and authority of something like a State, and then it endorses or sanctions &quot;evil&quot; (for lack of a better term) acts, it&#x27;s that much harder to muster opposition to those acts, since they&#x27;re nominally &quot;legal&quot;.",1431724470

First, &#x27;all that text&#x27; is really a misnomer, scientific papers are pretty dense (c. f any letter to Nature). Second, the audience here is not a machine, it&#x27;s a human, and humans are inherently biased toward stories. The best papers have a story (in the journalism sense, no the fiction sense), and they use this story to make a convincing argument. Without the story, you have data and data  is not an argument. As much as I&#x27;d like to believe that the data would be enough, we have to remember that we&#x27;re not producing arguments in a vacuum. The audience comes to the table with a lot of preexisting ideas, biases and beliefs and unwinding these is non-trivial. Think about evolution and Origin of the Species. Looking at the data now, it seems so obvious, but even the data along with stacks of arguments was not enough to convince people for a very long time.

Sublime suffers some of the same faults as Atom and does the `subl .` work to open a given folder on the first try without Sublime already being open yet? Textmate is dated.

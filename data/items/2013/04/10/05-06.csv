They don't exist for lack of imagination; they exist for timeless and fundamental reasons.<p>Do you think plain text will exist in 100 years?  If so then it's not that much a stretch to say that HTML will.  It astonishes me that people think that only code, and not data, will be transported over networks.  That seems to be what you are claiming -- that it's preferable to transmit code than data in all circumstances?<p>The argument isn't symmetric because I fully believe that VMs are necessary for the web.  I just don't agree with Kay that the designers of the web are idiots (he really says this) because they didn't <i>start</i> with a VM.  VMs will come and go as hardware and devices and circumstances change.  Data has much more longevity; it encodes fewer assumptions.<p>Assumptions that are no longer true are generally the reason a technology dies.  It is pretty easy to imagine a VM (unknowingly or not) encoding preferences for keyboard and mouse input; that technology would have died with the advent of touch screens.  Likewise, a VM that provides affordances for touch screens will likely be dated in 10 years when we're using some other paradigm.<p>HTTP and HTML are foundational to the web.  They are basically the simplest thing that could possibly work.  You can reimplement them in a few days using a high level language.  They will be around for a LONG LONG time.<p>More complicated constructs like JS and VMs will have shorter lifetimes.  I guarantee you that HTML will be around long after whatever comes <i>after</i> JavaScript, just like HTML will outlive Java Applets and Flash.<p>They layered architecture of the web is absolutely the right thing.

He ignored a study Penney had just completed on customer preferences, and gave merchants a one-sheet grid explaining what prices they could use.</i><p>I think that in JC Penney's case, excessive discounting may not have been a merchandising strategy but rather a symptom of allocation mismatches in their supply chain, leaving them with excess inventory (and associated costs). Their mistake was hiring a merchandising guy who didn't get this and tried to eliminate the discounts without fixing the underlying allocation problems.",1365570522

Google Fiber is just one of many efforts including Chrome/V8 and Spdy.<p>However going head to head with AT&T in Austin will NOT help this effort. AT&T is signaling Google and, more importantly, other potential gigabit internet service providers that it will compete with you and thus reduce your margins in a very capital intensive (i.e. risky) business. Anybody considers something similar in another city will think again.<p>Does anyone think the timing is a coincidence? If not why is AT&T doing this?<p>I would speculate that AT&T cannot handle any more capital spending and the debt it would require. They can barely keep up with the spending on mobile and their landline business is dying. Internet service over their existing (i.e. paid for) infrastructure has got to be their best business (certainly on return on capital). Google Fibre does them no good.",1365570499

Direct bitcoin transactions are more similar to debit cards (rather than cash) in a sense that they enable virtual money and you pay from what you have (except that you don't need any service to back that up, unlike the debit cards which require banks to enable them). I.e. ideally in the bar example, one wouldn't need to use any financial services, but would still be able to pay with virtual money a la just using a card, of course for that the circulation of bitcoins needs to be more active, so bar could actually use them, instead of opting for instantaneous conversion.",1365570199

Some combination of Walmart, Target, Costco, and Amazon (and I'm sure others that I'm leaving out) have basically taken over the inexpensive department store market, where price is the #1 purchase-decision factor. At some point, you end up in a logistics competition, where your margin is dependent on whether your supply chain is cheaper than someone else's. Within tech, the demise of Dell illustrates the perils of being a commodity supplier.<p>There's plenty of profit to be had in the higher end, selling ""the experience"". Nordstrom, for instance, is doing just fine. Being able to walk into a store, talk with knowledgable salespeople who can get a feel for your style and desires, then recommend products that suit them is a value that some customers are willing to pay for.<p>Johnson's background with Apple was in creating the latter sort of experience, but it simply did not match with the priorities of the JCP customer, and was driven by the notion of ""build a better store, and the customers will come"", without enough research into where potential gains and losses were.",1365570003

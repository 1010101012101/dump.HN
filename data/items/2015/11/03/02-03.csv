Not everything revolves around your feelings.<p>I&#x27;m not ignoring the issue you have pointed out, rather It would be nice to hear about nosh. There&#x27;s significantly more information about launchd than nosh, for example launchd has two videos, explaining the reasoning and methodology for bringing in launchd and the other apple libraries.<p>FreeBSD next 10 years:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mri66Uz6-8Y"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mri66Uz6-8Y</a><p>NextBSD intro:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49sPYHh473U"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49sPYHh473U</a><p>A quick search on google and their are no videos about nosh. The nosh website doesn&#x27;t contain much information about the design of nosh. Looking around the source of nosh the various html files look promising and i&#x27;m going through those. Unfortunately my c++ skills are inadequate to judge the code quality of nosh effectively. Which on a side note I think will hurt nosh chances of being adopted, because the open source os world seems biased to using C. I&#x27;t just harder to find stuff out about nosh and you seemed knowledgeable on the subject, hence the original question. So is there any good documentation on nosh besides the source it&#x27;s self?",1446519535

The “Hack” and “Move fast and break  things” culture must make it very hard for developers to  focus on quality.<p>Every now and then production questions the business value for this. Recently my company released a new game feature and we had to throttle it back in a hacky way immediately as user did not like it. However the database calls and code are still being executed. Now the business does not want us to revert the code (or re-implement the throttle in proper way ) as they see no business value in that and fear of breaking other things as part of this &quot;unnecessary&quot; code changes.<p>I tried to explain that we just stopped the feature as it was an emergency as we did not have time to revert and re-push the server. This feature was well tested (not a brand new feature ) so we did not have a throttle . We found a hack and manage to stop the feature so that users are not outraged.<p>May be the right decision was not to tell about the hack to the business at all. They would have have to wait till we revert the code properly and re-push the server. But as an engineer you worry about the product as well, we I could not resist .",1446519472

It&#x27;s very convenient of you to not be interested in property; if you ignore resources and access to them and every driver of conflict and coercion then sure it&#x27;s truly wonderful to be against coercion. But this is solipsistic: We can all live without food or property or shelter and never force anyone to do anything and starve to death alone. But the moment you even pick a berry you have taken it from everyone else and are claiming it as your property. Similarly with animals, water, property. This in itself is a coercive act; it involves the threat of force in your view. So simple human existence is by nature coercive. The state is only a formalized tool we use to reduce it: general agreement on basic principles and a willingness to share.<p>Your point about the moral authority of 51% of the population coercing the remaining 49% is an interesting one, but I would answer thusly: you are not coerced at all, in fact you are free to exist without obeying the state. All you must do is avoid taking the state&#x27;s possessions: don&#x27;t breathe our air, don&#x27;t eat our food, don&#x27;t live on our land, don&#x27;t drink our water. If you&#x27;re willing to do this you can live completely coercion-free. It&#x27;s the kind of choice libertarians love; the illusion of one.",1446518773

In first-year wood shop, we started out with a little coping saw and a file and made golf tee holders and bird houses out of soft pine. After a while, our projects got bigger and we moved on to using stuff like planer and jigsaw. After we demonstrated proficiecy with those we moved on to more complex/dangerous tools like the lathe, table saw and drill presses. Stuff that could easily take a finger off, if you weren&#x27;t careful.<p>Throwing someone unexperienced at a lathe or a bandsaw is simply _irresponsible_. I think that one need to learn the basics, to grasp the the mechanics, with simplier/less dangerous tool. However, one proficiency is gained there is a new class of tool available to a skilled craftsperson/professional.<p>Yes, its important to learn how to use a coping saw, but that doesn&#x27;t make a table-saw &quot;bullshit&quot;. Just a different class of tool, that could seriously hurt you if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.",1446518127

Like many others I stumbled onwards through Vax terminals and onto PCs, where I was lucky enough to obtain a copy of AT&T System V/386, heh heh. So that&#x27;s a fairly decent 35 years of experience with command-line interfaces...<p>...and about 15-20 years of dismay at people continuing to reinvent the damn things. Look, you know the only reason for commands like <i>mv</i> and <i>cp</i> was that one time we had 300 baud modems hooked up to dumb terminals and there were good reasons to worry about minimizing character count? It doesn&#x27;t mean that the resulting obscurantism was a good thing in itself. It&#x27;s not. There are <i>no good reasons</i> to make people go through typing everything and to perpetuate ASCII graphics fetishism and so on. If anything, it&#x27;s become an unspoken set of rules to keep people away from our nerd treehouse. Actually typing out all that shit is a huge waste of time.<p>Writing shell scripts and makefiles by hand is insane, we buiilt computers precisely to save us from this sort of pointless tedium. I find it really depressing that UI innovation on Linux has basically ground to a hatl and that KDE, Gnome and so on are have basically not evolved at all over the last 15 years. Back around 1999 I was running Gnome and E.16 (or was it 15?) and I had a hugely customizable UI that was may more powerful and flexible than anything on Mac/Win (admittedly this was less true for applications, but still. Nowadays when I boot into Linux it mostly feels old and tired.<p>As I pointed out, I&#x27;ve been using CLIs for a good long time. I got my first copy of Linux from comp.os.minix because there were no distributions as such at the time. It&#x27;s not like I can&#x27;t figure this stuff out. But I&#x27;m sick of it! There&#x27;s a reason most consumer software is built around GUIs - they are better. In a well-designec GUI, you can find everything you need within the user interface, instead of having to accumulate a heap of arcane CLI knowledge (starting with the question &#x27;what do I type?!&#x27;).<p>It&#x27;s true that the CLI offers greater flexibility of you know exactly what you want to do. It&#x27;s also true that for physical items, you can cast or 3d print something that is absolutely perfectly shaped if you know what you&#x27;re doing. But if you have kids and you want them to discover the joys of engineering, you should probably buy them a big box of Lego instead of a set of carving tools or a CAD workstation.",1446518033

Broken men are unable to escape from hearing everyday how the executives of their ex-employers are reaping massive profits and personal gains. Their lives are overlaid with exhausted savings and unemployment benefits; all the negatives in their lives beat down on their heads like a ceaseless hailstorm. Finally, swallowing their pride, they turn to the caring myth of family and friends only to find them replaced with the harsh reality of indifferent relatives and unhelpful acquaintances.

DOM manipulation is fast - all modern browsers use a dirty-bit system where modifying the DOM is basically a few pointer swaps.  <i>Layout</i>, however, is slow, and dirtying the DOM requires <i>at least one</i> layout as soon as control returns from JS.  If you intersperse measure and modify calls, it&#x27;s more.<p>However, what is true is that:<p>1. Both JS and the DOM are fast enough that you can lay out most reasonable pages within the threshold of visual perception (~150-200ms).<p>2. If you need to layout the page during an animation frame, you&#x27;re hosed anyway.  You have a frame budget of 16.67ms and layout will take 100ms+ on mobile.<p>And so the practical, qualitative conclusion is the same: you can use React for your basic page transformations & rendering, but you need to use CSS transforms and offload the work to the GPU if you want to have a prayer of making animations work on mobile.

Everything that has ever been done in science amounts to doing the math and getting the right results.<p>This is a rift in the philosophy of science: is science telling us real things about the real world, or is it just producing models that happen to fit data generated from experiments?<p>I take the latter position, but rather than concluding from this that I should no longer use the term &quot;the real world&quot;, I find it more useful to simply redefine &quot;the real world&quot; to be the set of models that are consistent with data generated from experiments. This means that if multiple models that explain the same phenomenon are all consistent with the data, all of the models are equally &quot;real&quot;.",1446516008

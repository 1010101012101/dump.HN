New technology with technical merit arrives, smart people latch on and build things with it, improving the knowledge base and library depth.  Then, more people flock on as they follow the leaders.",1201740836
107184,comment,107132,107167,0,0,mixmax,,,"The point of the post is to point out some basic psychology and human nature. And I think it is quite accurate too.<p>Note that PG and DHH could just as easily have been anyone else, the article just uses them as examples to prove a point.<p>And frankly I think that a lot of readers of YC news could do good with some insight into psychology and what makes people tick. It is a large part of a startups success.<p>(note: I don't intend to offend anyone, it is simply humble advice which you may of course ignore at your own discretion)",1201740810

107182,comment,106826,106952,0,0,kingnothing,,,"I think the point he was trying to make is that the average American is so far ahead, financially, of people in third world countries that we take for granted the availability of money and credit. There are people starving to death over there because they don't have the money or means to feed themselves. They can't get jobs because there aren't any companies. People who might want to own a company can't do that because there is no one to lend them the capital to get started. They're in an impossible situation that's difficult for us to understand because we're so far removed from it.<p>So, when all of a sudden, out of nowhere, some company comes along and says to all of these people, ""Hey everyone, we'll loan you the money you need to start a business so you can live"", the people are offered an opportunity to change their lives to such an extreme degree that they're willing to do whatever it takes to get the money and pay it back. Here, in the Western world, if you start a business, fail, and lose half a million dollars, you can brush it off and try again with a different idea and investor. Granted, it might take you a while to find someone else who is willing to put the capital up, but you can. Over there, they can't. They have only one shot, so they take it and do the absolute best they can because it is an opportunity that will only come once.<p>With that in mind, nearly every loan in the Western world can be taken with a ho-hum attitude becuase the opportunity will present itself again. That just isn't the case for those people.",1201740557

I have asked the designers at my employer to mark in the mockups the hex color values for all elements in the design. This is a small extra step on their part that settles disputes before they start. They also mark font sizes and line-height (they call it leading I think) where needed.",1201740302

107177,comment,106927,106927,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I think the point of the article is to say, ""You can't buy Apple's great software without paying for Apple's great hardware, but you can purchase Apple's great hardware, and still put someone else's software in there. Therefor, Apple is primarily a hardware company.""<p>I would say instead, that Apple is a device company. Even though you can purchase Apple's hardware, it comes bundled with their software, no matter what, and if you want to purchase their software, you can only put it on their hardware.<p>The only device which you can put someone else's software on (disregarding linux on the ipod) is MS Windows on a Macintosh. You can't (with Apple's approval) put windows on Apple TV, iPods, or, the iPhone.<p>Apple is about the complete package. They prefer to design their own hardware, build their own software for their hardware, and build there own applications for their own OS.<p>The moral of the story: Apple, makes phenomenal products, does not play well with others.",1201739650

107166,comment,107132,107163,0,0,pg,,,"I was thinking that too.  I can't think of any cases recently where I've engaged in relentless self-promotion.<p>I mean, I write essays, and since I believe the things I say in them, I am in a technical sense writing things that promote my own ideas, and thus me.  But that's true of anyone who writes.<p>He can't have meant anything so complicated.  Here's my theory of what he meant, based on his use of Matz as an example: relentlessly skipping the self-effacing remarks that most people surround their ideas with to help make the medicine go down.<p>If that's what he means, he's right.  I don't do it out of arrogance, though.  I skip that kind of stuff partly because it seems too much like a deliberate trick, and partly because it makes sentences longer than they need to be.",1201738043

I top-post maybe half the time now, depending on the kind of reply (as you note) but also my audience's expectations.  For example, when replying to a developer list for an open-source project, I'll usually use interleaving because it's the style in that community.  In business contexts I'm more likely to top-post because that's what everyone else does (and as another poster noted, Outlook is broken).<p>I guess we don't disagree too much; I'm just saying I don't try to force interleaving where it's not likely to be appreciated.",1294944979

The simple fact of the matter is no one device is going to fit all the needs of all users, whether those needs are real or just perceived. I agree with Marco on a lot of things and admire his work, but he does have a weird blind spot when it comes to Android (like his opinion that it is going to be much less relevant now that there is a Verizon iPhone).<p>The one device model does have its positives, of course. But the advantages are either too niche or too minor to matter. Fragmentation is the favorite knock, but outside of the tech world not that many care. A significant percentage of iOS users don't even update cause they don't realized they can. Software is somewhat easier to develop, but the advantages are overstated here. Accessories are nice, but those are post sale for the most part. Very, very few people buy phones based on a case or a dock.

If anything, it's the eventual use of market power for profiteering.<p>> But it would become another closed de facto standard, just like IE6.<p>Huh? IE6 is a <i>browser</i> not a <i>standard</i>.<p>> This is comparing apples and oranges. Flash is a plugin,<p>This is splitting hairs and a straw man. The user does not care or typically doesn't differentiate between something that's part of the browser and something that is a bundled plug-in. The user experience is basically the same.<p>So any argument using a criteria about building in a proprietary and closed standard to the browser versus bundling a proprietary and closed plug-in is at somewhere between fatuous and disingenuous.<p>> If you want to do any kind of video on the web, you don't have a choice. Flash is needed.<p>WRONG. Bizarrely wrong in fact since we're arguing about the HTML5 container for video and supported codecs. Flash isn't involved. This isn't vapourware either. Modern browsers already support it.<p>>  it is much more likely that an open format will prevail in the end.<p>If there are two dominant standards, sites will be faced with a choice: double-encode everything or pick one. Many have already picked H.264. What's more likely? Double-encoding or simply delivering H.264 to Chrome via a Flash (rather than HTML5) container?<p>If anything, this move prolongs the existence of Flash.<p>> Just because a format is widespread offline does not mean that it is suitable for use on the web.<p>Is the author <i>really</i> suggesting H.264 a) isn't widespread on the Web and/or b) isn't suitable for use on the Web? Really?<p>> In other words: The processing will always be there, and instead of re-processing to a slightly more compressed H.264 file for online play, it can be converted to an open format.<p>If the author thinks this move will displace H.264 they are sadly mistaken. For one, the license fees for using H.264 are negligible for the largest players. For another, there is an <i>enormous</i> installed base of devices with hardware H.264 decoding. Hundreds of millions in fact, most notably the various Apple iDevices.<p>These provide a compelling use for the continued use of H.264 in the long term.<p>> As already explained, videos are typically re-encoded or processed in some way anyway.<p>Yes but double the processing and double the storage are real issues.<p>> Notice the word ""plugin"". It means that we're basically removing HTML5 video, and returning to plugins. All the benefits of native video disappear just like that<p>What benefits are those exactly? At least for now the user experience, HTML5 video is still playing catch up to Flash video in terms of <i>user experience</i>.<p>> If I am not mistaken, the share of open standards based browsers is growing at the expense of Internet Explorer.<p>Worst case for IE is still about ~50%. That still makes it the single largest browser. Chrome's share exceeds Safari's (AFAIK) but the latter is still significant and I can't imagine it getting WebM support anytime soon. Apple are very much wedded to H.264 support by virtue of their devices if nothing else (anecdote: I played 6 hours of video on a plane on my iPad using 10% of the battery).<p>> it is H.264 which takes away choice.<p>By definition, not giving someone a choice takes away choices.<p>All of the arguments for this move seem to be focused on the long term. That's fine but in the short term it will unarguably cause users and sites headaches.<p>> I also find it puzzling that Google is being accused of giving users fewer choices, while Microsoft and Apple aren't even mentioned.<p>Hold yourself to a higher standard (and, more importantly, preach those standards to others) and you will be the recipient of greater scrutiny.<p>At best, the author's argument descends to ""two wrongs make a right"".<p>Note: I'm saying arguing in favour of Flash. In fact, I consider the lack of Flash on my iDevices to be a <i>feature</i> rather than a limitation.<p>Ironically this moves will likely prolong Flash and slow the adoption of HTML5 as a result.",1294944120

The fact that the US housing bubble was most severe in California, Florida, and Nevada has little to do with the state and local government policies there and more to do with geography and migration patterns related to demographics.  In Europe, the Germans are basically being asked to bail out governments who got into trouble as a result of malfeasance or bad policy that had nothing to do with the German government.  Until the Feds start explicitly bailing out states like California or New Jersey (which could certainly still happen), it seems to me as if they are really just bailing out themselves.<p><i>Since these bonds (E-bonds) would be guaranteed by the European Union as a whole, they would offer a way for troubled economies to avoid vicious circles of falling confidence and rising borrowing costs.</i><p>They would also offer a way for these economies to take advantage of lower interest rates to continue to act irresponsibly, which seems a likely scenario given the history of this situation.  Political institutions (and people) being what they are, it seems like extreme amounts of pain is likely to be the only effective tool to get them to actually move away from spendthrift policies.  The Euro would probably be in a better position if it came with an explicit requirement that the bonds of member countries could not be purchased by the Union itself or by other Union members, which might have reduced the appetite for the bailout trade that major banks were so happy to engage in (although such guarantees can certainly be circumvented, as the Argentine example shows).",1294942076

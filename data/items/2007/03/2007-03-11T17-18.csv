3610,comment,3492,3555,0,0,JoeEntrepreneur,,,"Thanks Lucas. You have been very helpful.<p>I guess I shall see when I launch it about what happens.
Onista is HUGE application and I do not want to release it with any less features than originally planned. Just my UI Mockup is 200 pages. (just giving you idea on how big the application is). Onista being huge application, it has lot many features, so I believe that users will and will not like some features, but they will have lots of them to choose from.<p>Thanks again.",1173635694

If you read the TechCrunch comments on FreeBase, there are a couple of people who say they had the exact same idea -- one even reserved ""ifreebase.com."" The idea is definitely not new. Facebook wasn't entirely novel either. There are a lot of factors that can make a good idea unprofitable, or a so-so idea a big hit (who knew what AJAX was before it was called ""AJAX""?).
So, yes, your idea may be stolen if it's good. If your idea is obvious, there is a chance that people are just too lazy to implement it. The only way to win in either case, is to work damn hard on your idea until fruitition.",1173635383

I'm in the states on an L1-A right now which allowed me to bypass the PERM process and qualify for my green card under the EB1 classification; the waiting list under this class is only ~8 months.  L1's are bit more expensive, but if you're in a hurry they're worth looking into.",1173634089

As with most things it depends, but I&#x27;ll make the mistake of assuming you don&#x27;t need all of this data in memory and you won&#x27;t be iterating over the entire set of data on a regular (<1m) basis. In that case, it most likely makes sense to move to a relational database. You should ask yourself what kind of queries you&#x27;re running on the data and pick something appropriate. But for the data you&#x27;re listing, then yeah - go with a relational DB.<p>2. Again &quot;It depends&quot;. Postgresql is the most popular alternative to MySQL and I&#x27;d say at this point is more in vogue with the developer community. It&#x27;s supported on AWS RDS and Heroku has a great postgres.app for OSX. Your data is so simple that I&#x27;d encourage you to start there. In the future when you have specific needs then you can research more appropriate database technologies.<p>3. From what you&#x27;ve shown us then you should most likely move to a relational database. The size should shrink dramatically, too.",1413741414

8478964,comment,8478427,8478935,0,0,tptacek,,,"Regarding Android: not only could it be an accident, it almost certainly is an accident. For instance: the Android RNG flaw didn&#x27;t stem from a single coherent design flaw, but rather from the meta-flaw of relying on application-layer (or in this case runtime-layer) randomness, and not nailing the order of initialization in all the components. It&#x27;s easy to see why this would have happened by accident: (a) the belief that runtime-layer randomness is better, more performant, more reliable on mobile platform and (b) the lack of understanding that a single central kernel-level RNG is superior to app-layer RNGs (which is a relatively modern idea).<p>Regarding RSA: that&#x27;s not a backdoor in RSA. That&#x27;s a supposed backdoor in BSAFE, a library sold by RSA. The story pertains to BSAFE&#x27;s support for the Dual-EC PKRNG. (Of the supposed backdoors propagated by the NSA, by the way, this is probably the most credible).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what your allusion to Torvalds was meant to indicate.<p>The SSL/TLS downgrade attack you linked to didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the &quot;None&quot; ciphersuite, or re-negotiation.",1413741348

The algorithm is easy to grasp.  Naive implementations are resistant to timing and power analysis.  Built in support for Tweaking, so you don&#x27;t need to mess around with weird modes of operation.  Large key size, and no mis-match between key and block size.  Efficient (~6 cpb).  It was designed by a large group of well known and respected cryptographers.<p>The simplicity of Threefish is the most important, in my opinion.  Applications of AES in the wild have been broken numerous times because of improper use of AES and its modes of operation.  Threefish is less likely to suffer those issues, since Tweaking is built in.  So, as of today, I think that benefit outweighs the possible risk of Threefish being found weak (and keep in mind that Threefish is specifically designed to resist analysis by using a large number of rounds.  Breaks in reduced Threefish are expected, and are not likely to be breaks in full Threefish).<p>Additionally, if people (e.g. Google) are willing to use ChaCha20, I don&#x27;t see why they wouldn&#x27;t be willing to use Threefish.  They&#x27;re built on the same principles, as far as I can tell, and both have just as much backing (in terms of peer review and who designed them).

Not sure I agree, but it&#x27;s unusual to see a professional writer/artist take a stance like this:<p>&quot;Listening to a Beethoven concerto or spending time in front of a van Gogh painting or reading a poem by Blake can be a profound experience on a scale that playing bridge or bowling a 220 game can never be. Art is all the things art is supposed to be. But art is also a superior amusement. Am I wrong in thinking this? I don&#x27;t know. But I remember in my twenties reading plays by Strindberg, a novel by Max Frisch, Rilke&#x27;s poetry, listening all night to music by Bartók, watching a tv special on the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo and feeling in each case that my life had to change after these experiences, it couldn&#x27;t help but be affected by these experiences and changed. There was simply no way I would not become a different person. But then I found out soon enough my life was not going to change after all... I guess I came to the hard realization that art doesn&#x27;t make anything happen. No. I don&#x27;t believe for a minute in that absurd Shelleyan nonsense having to do with poets as the “unacknowledged legislators” of this world. What an idea! Isak Dinesen said that she wrote a little every day, without hope and without despair. I like that. The days are gone, if they were ever with us, when a novel or a play or a book of poems could change people&#x27;s ideas about the world they live in or even about themselves. Maybe writing fiction about particular kinds of people living particular kinds of lives will allow certain areas of life to be understood a little better than they were understood before.

It's certainly a very interesting development (especially considering mobile applications), but I would either wait for an open source framework or create my own.

No matter how much money you make, you won't be able to buy back time!""<p>This is one of my main reasons for starting a startup - I want to be able to spend more time with my kids.  At my current job, I get maybe an hour and a half to spend with them each night after coming home from work, before they have to go to bed.<p>Starting my own company and getting it to the point where it's profitable will allow me to spend the time I need with my kids.  I'll be able to work from home, doing hours that are necessary to keep the company going.  My kids and wife will see more of me, and we'll all be happier. :)

7535,comment,227,379,0,0,razvanr,,,"I totally agree with not taking decisions lightly, but with a clear head. I've put all my studies on hold this year(currently 19) because it makes so much more sense to experiment as best I can at this stage. I've since been employed as a copywriter(great job), then as a programmer(hated it because things were moving too slow in that company) and I ultimately started a low-profile firm and pitched alternative outdoor marketing projects to big distribution firms here in Bucharest. 
What I'm trying to say is that in 9 months I've learned more than in my entire formal studies up until now. And it's not only about the knowledge but also about life experience and how to deal with things. It always demands great respect to take your own life into your hands and take decisions. It's also great to know that you can manage things on your own and be financially independent at this age. <p>I don't take formal studies lightly in any way, but I consider that it's great added value if I continue them in a few years.

7532,comment,6668,7234,0,0,ced,,,"I think that it's unrealistic to build a startup around an unsolved fundamentally hard problem. Can anyone think of a counter-example that succeeded? Typically, the problem is solved first, and then the startup is built to implement the solution.<p>Solving hard problems depends too much on creativity and research. I'm not sure I could do that under the pressure associated with a startup. The Google environment doesn't seem ideal either, come to think of it, but at least, I'm not the one absorbing the huge risk of failure.<p>Anybots is a startup that solved a hard problem, but it was self-funded, right? Would YC have funded them if it had been proposed by a 25-year-old Trevor Blackwell?",1175245382

If you weigh about 110, and your ideal weight is about 85, you hardly need to know historically what your weight was.<p>Thirdly, the best measure of ""weight loss"" is how you feel, not how much you weigh.<p>I can see merit in recording something but I think weight is the wrong metric, or maybe weight isn't an appropriate metric when taken in isolation.<p>Perhaps if it were weight correlated with mood, diet, time (of month? day? year?) or various life events then it'd be worthwhile.<p>Perhaps sending a text: ""110kg :S pizza"" indicating you're 110kg, feeling stressed and the last thing you ate was pizza.<p>If the ""request for information"" SMS were sent out at some sort of ""random sampling"" time, then you could probably build some sort of useful statistical model based on mood and food consumption correlating to fluctuations in weight then use the feedback to reduce weight over time.",1313634517

Not to mention some devs might be working for other clients and not yet shipped something themselves (as in my case).<p>Requiring installs via Xcode would only be a temporary slowdown before someone figures out the secret handshake and hacks around it.<p>Blocking reviews from devices with the latest iOS beta installed should be sufficient to eliminate most of these unfair reviews.",1313633615

App Review, as if they didn't have enough of a hard time with a bad reputation, would just be flooded by trash from first time developers or contract developers/companies that just created an account. Apple could make it mandatory to install using Xcode, but in the past, Xcode upgrades have bricked devices where iTunes doesn't. So I have a feeling that's not really a priority and more of a burden. Plus, it's braindead simple to install and use Xcode to install betas, and anyone desperate enough to pay $10 but not $100 should easily be able to get around that.<p>I really think all Apple needs to do is to block reviews from iOS 5 devices. Developers running betas won't be reviewing apps in the store (that's incredibly hypocritical and cruel if so) so nobody's going to be missing that. This doesn't harm beta testers and devs that want to install iOS betas.",1313633457

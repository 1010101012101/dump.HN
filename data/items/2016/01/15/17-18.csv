So the temptation is constantly to do something instead of saying &quot;well, that sucks, but we don&#x27;t have strong reason to believe anything we do will substantially improve things.&quot; That&#x27;s why we perform way too many interventions (particularly, invasive and surgical ones) that at best marginally improve average outcomes at incredible cost and substantial risk. Doctor and patient both want a magic fix. And all too often the fix is more harmful than helpful to the individual patient, even if on average it might be slightly beneficial.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s a place for heroic surgical efforts and research into exotic drugs.

In fact, the top 0.1 percent consists mainly of business executives, and while some of these executives may have made their fortunes by being associated with risky start-ups, most probably got where they are by climbing well-established corporate ladders. And the rise in incomes at the top largely reflects the soaring pay of top executives, not the rewards to innovation.<p>Most probably got there by climbing well established corporate ladders? Is there a source for this? It seems &quot;Executives, managers and supervisors (non-finance)&quot; is rather broad and does not address whether these are corporate structures that can &quot;set their own compensation&quot;.",1452880246

Rather than a distributed stateless currency (which I would argue is impossible), what Bitcoin has become is a currency whose sovereigns are accidentally selected, poorly organized, and not responsible to its currency users in any direct way.<p>There is a famous concept called the &quot;tyranny of structurelessness,&quot; which says that there are always political structures when groups of humans interact, the question is just whether they are defined or hidden. A &quot;structureless&quot; organization, rather than egalitarian, is governed by a small secret clique that assembles for unknown or possibly trivial reasons.

It&#x27;s hard to sell things online when you have to deal with card fraud and charge backs.<p>This notion that &quot;customers&quot; must have fraud protection is false; people use cash every day without any fraud protection.  The credit card companies have sold people on the idea of fraud protection because it&#x27;s necessary in a system when you give your private key (card number) to every merchant you deal with and your private key is often stolen.  Credit card protection is a solution to a badly designed pull based credit card system; it solves a self created problem.  A cash based system like bitcoin does not require fraud protection, it&#x27;s cash.",1452878214

The team behind btcd, a Bitcoin full node written in Go, made the following observations about block size [1]:<p>1. a 32 MB block, when filled with simple P2PKH transactions, can hold approximately 167,000 transactions, which, assuming a block is mined every 10 minutes, translates to approximately 270 tps<p>2. a single machine acting as a full node takes approximately 10 minutes to verify and process a 32 MB block, meaning that a 32 MB block size is near the maximum one could expect to handle with 1 machine acting as a full node<p>3. a CPU profile of the time spent processing a 32 MB block by a full node is dominated by ECDSA signature verification, meaning that with the current infrastructure and computer hardware, scaling above 300 tps would require a clustered full node where ECDSA signature checking is load balanced across multiple machines.<p>For context, a meager 300 tps is less than 10% of what VISA does - hence this solves no long standing problems in Bitcoin, yet it condemns all the nodes to run in compute clusters in datacenters. Naturally, &quot;small blockists&quot; as we&#x27;re called, point out that this isn&#x27;t how Bitcoin works today at all. Forcing nodes into compute clusters in remote datacenters is a major, sweeping departure from nodes running on home networks with consequences both forseeable and unforseeable.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://blog.conformal.com/btcsim-simulating-the-rise-of-bitcoin/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.conformal.com/btcsim-simulating-the-rise-of-bit...</a>",1452878151

10910618,comment,10909886,10910421,0,0,maaku,,,"> Hearn seems to be saying that Bitcoin right now is not really decentralized - aka the Chinese firewall problem and so much power already centralized in a few peoples hands.<p>This is true, and people are working to fix it on many levels. For example, separating the transaction selection from coinbase reward (what p2pool does, but with better scaling properties). Also, large chip manufacturers like BitFury selling all-in-one mining setups rather than running the miners themselves--they are presently doing mostly in-house mining, but are moving in the right direction. Also, smart property miners so that it doesn&#x27;t matter if the hardware centralizes to where power is cheapest. There are also protocol-level changes along the lines of Bitcoin-NG, or non-outsourceable puzzles which remove a good deal of the mining centralization pressures.<p>So what you might not have gotten from the Hearn article is that this is a known problem and while scarily bad, work <i>is</i> progressing on this front.<p>>  He also seems to be saying that the motivations for Bitcoin Core developers are not based on good faith technical disagreements, but more about bad faith political disagreements.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to say to that. We had two open workshops last year for discussing the scaling problem, which Hearn did not participate in. We have a plan for increasing the capacity of the system which also references what we do genuinely believe to be the technical hurdles to scaling. I charitably hope that Hearn is simply ignorant on this matter.<p>> I assume you also believe that Hearn&#x27;s qualms about the current centralization are wrong in some way.<p>No, the present state of mining centralization is concerning. But I&#x27;m not willing to throw in the towel on that just yet.<p>> Can you tell me why the decentralized ledger can&#x27;t just be made more granular so that increasing the block size might make kick out current under-powered nodes, but those nodes could be turned into virtual nodes where under-powered machines could pool resources to establish a virtual node and thus maintain decentralization?<p>Decentralization in Bitcoin is about <i>mining</i> decentralization. Everything else barely matters. A cabal of miners can censor transactions costlessly. A cabal of miners can require extra-protocol information to de-anonymize bitcoin holders. A cabal of miners can keep anyone else from mining bitcoin, thereby closing off competitors. The threat to Bitcoin&#x27;s decentralization is centralization of control over the mining hashpower -- whether from the form of pools, or external coercion on pools, or companies having exclusive or back-door access to mining hardware (e.g. 21co).<p>Outside of the back-doors, what causes mining centralization is a combination of validation cost, latency, and external factors like electrical power subsidies.<p>But, having said that, what you propose is known in the community as &#x27;probabilistic validation&#x27; -- only checking part of the contents of a block and being able to relay small fraud proofs when such validation fails. This requires the ability to create such fraud proofs, which we will get with segregated witness (being worked on by Bitcoin Core right now), and with a lot work will eventually get us to the point where validation cost is not concern so long as there is a large, healthy network of probabilistically validating full nodes.<p>But we&#x27;d still have latency and real world power economies to worry about.",1452878122

And communication allows for faster, less error prone boats too.<p>You are describing a distant, potential future.  We have no where near the level of tech, not development as people needed to actualize that.<p>CAD is part of that journey.  With it, advanced products, structures, etc... are all possible, but the work involved is still insane.<p>I&#x27;ve seen and been a part of the development of systems that do this, and even on trivial parts there is a whole lot to be accounted for.<p>The bars we have in place, that differentiate engineering from design, permits to build, geological studies and other various impact studies all regulate the building of things that people depend on and that they must trust.<p>We have those in place for really good reasons, and one of those is the fact that we just don&#x27;t have mastery as a species.  Not yet.<p>All I here is, &quot;dang, it costs money to do it right&quot;, and &quot;why can&#x27;t I just copy my neighbor?&quot;<p>The answer lies in the complexity of the world and the dynamics of the people here in it.<p>Nice vision, but good luck with that.<p>For now, I suspect the more productive answer is to continue making CAD smarter and more accessible to ordinary people.

And the same is actually true for teaching a college student who has ssh/web access to their university file server how to make a distributed git repository setup with <i>real</i> &quot;pull requests&quot; (where I tell you my URL and a branch) vs. teaching someone how to make an account on GitHub and use their web interface to make a repository and then use their pull request user interface to get data between forks. I know this as I teach lectures on git, and it is seriously two console commands on your server to set up a fully working git setup in the way git was designed to be used.<p>GitHub has managed to cause a culture around git that there exist problems that don&#x27;t exist that they can solve, and then their solutions are one-off specific solutions that only work so well if you are willing to use all their other features and you get all your developers and users to use the service as well.

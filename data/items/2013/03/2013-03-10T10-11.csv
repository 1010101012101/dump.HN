5351417,comment,5351287,5351371,1,0,derefr,,,"There are things HMDs are useful for besides recording/storing sense data. In fact, I would say, so many of them (and growing further with each new development), that a policy like this will eventually just become impossible to enforce--it would be like asking people to leave their phones at the door, or perhaps even their prescription glasses.<p>But, of course, this <i>is</i> still a problem that needs to be solved; never before have the barriers to recording everyone around you, unbeknownst to them, been so low. (Whereas before, only professionals--spies, reporters, hostage-negotiators, etc.--really bothered to go through all the schlep required.)<p>So, perhaps, in the future, a law will be passed requiring HMDs (and phones, actually--there's no reason they don't also count) to get a ""privacy-zone"" feature. Within range of any wi-fi AP emitting a ""privacy-zone beacon"", the HMD would be legally required to disable its recording features. This brings the barrier-of-entry back up to ""have to jailbreak your HMD and override the restriction"", which is similar to ""buy a gizmo from a spy-store"" in terms of difficulty, so I would say it's equitable.<p>Of course, then you could get police walking around emitting privacy-zone beacons, and other totalitarian effects.<p>The real underlying problem, causing things like that, is that completely <i>technological</i> systems are prone to <i>social</i> exploitation, because our own <i>social mores</i> aren't carried over into the technological domain. So, instead, we would want to rely partially on the technology, and partially on social enforcement.<p>A good balance might be: entering a privacy zone prompts you to disable your recording--a single ""click"" will do so, but you can ignore/cancel the request. Once you've complied, you can't re-enable recording until you leave the privacy zone. Also, the privacy-zone beacon will be aware of whether you've complied with the request. Thus, as the owner of a private establishment (e.g. a bar), you can simply activate your privacy-zone beacon and attenuate its range out to some distance beyond the perimeter of your building--and then have a bouncer who won't let people in until they see, among whatever other conditions--that they have assented to disabling recording.",1362913111

Other models tend to be more horizontally scalable, but this was not a priority for most of database history, nor for most real-world situations.<p>* compactness - the on-disk overhead of a SQL database is fairly limited, about 40-50% in practice. Obviously, a flat file has even less overhead (<10%, generally), but some non-SQL systems consume storage willy-nilly (it's not uncommon to see XML overheads surpass 500%, and Mongo overhead hovers around 90-100%).<p>* robustness - in the SQL standard, ""undefined behavior"" is kept to an absolute minimum. In particular, transactions are invaluable anti-Heisenbugs, but cascading rules, sanity constraints, and fixed schemas also reduce production gotchas (at the cost of development agility, of course).",1362913034

It's better if it's good for those oppressed and worse if it's making that oppression grow. It's still bad, though, and so it should be only temporary.<p>> Congratulations, your internalization of guilt and willingness to be discriminated against does not extend to me, and you have no right to tell me that it should.<p>Hey, relax! I'm not telling you that you should feel in any particular way, am I? I was saying how I feel personally, nothing more.<p>> I'm not responsible for the crap that happened in the past, and I'm not okay with being told that I should bear the consequences of poor decisions made before my time.<p>Um, the problem here is that - if you are a white male - you are <i>still benefiting</i> from those decisions. You may say that you have never actively did anything against any woman or against an idea of equality - and I believe you - but you still got a job because of inequalities created in the past. I'm not telling you that you're abilities alone weren't sufficient! But they <i>might have been</i> insufficient if you just happened to be a woman...<p>> Twenty or thirty years is the prime working window of my life. It's difficult enough, thanks.<p>I understand what you feel and I'm too scared that it will hit me. I'm not happy about it in the least.<p>But then I think that, hey, there are women out there that are doing really well, despite all the problems they have. I also believe that I'm in every way as capable as these women and so I believe that I would still be alright. I might not, of course, that's a risk, but there are many risky things in life and I think that probability of me or you being personally hit by some pro-equality solutions is much lower than us being hit by global recession... or by a meteorite tomorrow.<p>And if the risk is higher and you don't like it - we can negotiate. We can think of a way of reducing this risk for you while still doing some good. But the risk will be there, I can't deny this, and I have no other answer for this other that that I believe it needs to be done. Something needs to be done.",1362912527

5351393,comment,5350581,5350662,4,0,tripzilch,,,"If you know how to select Comic Sans, you know how to select a different serif like Times. In default Windows installs there's at least 3-5 other choices for ""serious serif font"". And people do that, also the less tech-savvy ones: if they just want to type their homework, it's Times (or Arial), no second thought. But if it's something they want to ""stand out"" or be different they can easily pick a substitute like Georgia from the list.<p>But if people just write a note, or anything they intend to come across as ""not too stern, not too serious, but also not too boring"" there is just Comic Sans, in the default list of Windows fonts.<p>Like another commenter said, it's like a market is underserved. Except it's not a market, because it's Windows' <i>default</i> font list (there's enough alternatives on the <i>market</i>). It needs another informal, slightly quirky font if you want to break the reign of Comic Sans. They might have gone a bit in this direction with Calibri (subtly rounded) and Candara (playful) but those are way too subtle to notice in the (oddly tiny) font selection lists.<p>And something else, IMO, Times News Roman is for me the example that, apart from popularity and being an over-used default font, there <i>is</i> something extra wrong with Comic Sans. After all those years of being negatively conditioned with Times as the default Apache 404 Error font, and so many other places, all that's caused is a strong notion of neutrality and blandness. I don't dislike Times, and I also believe there is no discussion on that it's strictly better designed than Comic Sans: it's got more glyphs, the letter forms are more constant and harmonious, etc. And with some thought[0], you can combine it with another font (Arial being the obvious choice) and use it in a headline/body text combo, and it actually doesn't even look half bad. Somebody put some thought in that, it looks clean and they just happen to be two of the most-used fonts. I challenge anyone to pull that off with Comic Sans, even in combination with another font.<p>Personally I think, add just one cool informal font to the Windows default list, and IMO it will be fine. Really the thing that bothers me most about Comic Sans is that it's the <i>only</i> choice [for people not savvy enough to install extra fonts], so I can't really fault anyone for using it because any alternative I could suggest involves quite a bit of extra work for them (in addition it might revert to some default font on the next office PC where it's not available).<p>[0] this almost always means: whitespace",1362912441

The point is that SQL solves a lot of problems rather well and every NoSQL database has its own drawbacks. In the end you have a lot of NoSQL databases that solve some specific problems particularly well but have major drawbacks in other situations. SQL databases tend to fit a lot of solutions quite well, they are tested, stable, do transactions, can even scale and (for me) most important: SQL is a standard, the query language is well understood and documented, it is relatively easy to switch between SQL databases. But it's for practical purposes impossible to switch between a given set of NoSQL databases, let alone you need to learn a lot of new things or need another set of developers. Recent example in my project: I had a problem that did fit particularly well into Redis (small, self contained writes) but i also needed good querying capabilites. So after fiddling around with Redis and trying to make it work i had to abandon Redis. Next choice would have been: MongoDB or MySQL. The project already uses a MySQL server and i am easily able to replace MySQL with SQLite, Postgres or Oracle by using an ORM (SQLAlchemy). So the choice was easy. MongoDB would have been the worse choice but a possibility.<p>I'd wish someone would come up with a common query language that could be reused on different NoSQL databases, that would make NoSQL much more an option. UnSQL[1] looks abandoned :(<p>So after all: Every problem has its solutions, every program a good fit of a database. Either NoSQL or SQL, don't just point to some NoSQL database because it is the current buzzword, but ONLY because it can solve a problem better then a given SQL database. Then it doesn't matter if you call it SQL or NoSQL. Your NoSQL solution simply needs to redeem the benefits of SQL (standardized query language, transactions) with other benefits.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.unqlspec.org/display/UnQL/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unqlspec.org/display/UnQL/Home</a>",1362911808

Paired with this sound source and played by Jordan Rudress, it works. (Who also has something to do with this new company, it seems)<p>Pat Metheny's approach to the guitar synth speaks to this, I think:<p><pre><code>    Unlike many guitar synth users, Metheny limits himself to a very small
    number of sounds. In interviews, he has argued that each of the timbres
    achievable through guitar synthesis should be treated as a separate 
    instrument, and that he has tried to master each of these ""instruments"" 
    instead of using it for incidental color. One of the ""patches"" that Pat 
    used often is on Roland's JV-80 ""Vintage Synth"" expansion card titled 
    ""Pat's GR-300"".  [1]
</code></pre>
I'm not trying to argue against new ways of controlling sound. However, I do think we should ask far more of the makers than ""think of the possibilities."" Part of the control surface design process should be to think deeply about and experiment with the way the additional dimensions can be used, and the fruits of that process should be passed to the person who buys it. (The continuum may be a good example of this, as it looks like they ship it with an internal synth.<p>> You may not be one of them, but why do you need to be ""suspicious?"" These experimenters don't take away your ability to play a guitar.<p>Point taken, I'm probably not one of them. But I used to be, and there's a lot of snake oil out there. My experience with newfangled instruments is as follows:<p>- Korg Padkontrol: This was my only real contact with an MPC-style interface. I wanted to use it to sequence drums in real time, and it was decidedly mediocre for that. When using it for other things, part of the musical task turned to the configuration of the controller. It's creativity, but a different kind to be sure. It blurs the line between performance and composition.<p>- Zendrum: Seeing that people were able to play live on these things somewhat convincingly led me to try it. It never really clicked for me. I spent too much time configuring and never enough actually practicing the instrument. There are many reasons this could be my fault, not the least of which is that I'm not a drummer.<p>- Chapman Stick knockoff: I was never able to get beyond just piddling around on this thing. My imagination was captured by a video I saw on the web at some point, and I guess the ad copy closed the sale. But some weeks after I got it, I was left with a distinct feeling of ""now what?"" It was an instrument without any useful context. I've been told that the real thing is far more compelling than the knockoffs; perhaps I'll try one of those some day.<p>This is far more likely a commentary on myself than on these three instruments. For me, searching for the perfect instrument was something like creating a new programing language before writing your program. It's a never-ending task that inevitably fizzles out. I have since been better served by my Telecaster.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny#Guitar_synthesizer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny#Guitar_synthesizer</a>",1362910788

For example, I applied for an audio tester position ( non web related ) about 5 months ago that would have been perfect for my skill set and that I would have absolutely loved. I built up a good rapport with the project leader. They then gave me a basic online test about 3 weeks ago. Before they gave me the audio section (which I'm confident I aced) they gave me a subsection asking me questions about computer networking as well as a few questions that technically I knew the answer to but the way they were phrased completely confused the hell out of me. I then got a rejection email. Regardless, I'm confident that I would have been perfect for the role even if I didn't know by heart how to network a Windows system (I could easily look it up on Google and figure it out without any problems). But to answer your question, no I haven't created cover letters that are similar to this post. I try to phrase my cover letters in the self interest of the company. Nobody wants to hear otherwise and they simply don't have any reason to. One little secret though, about 8 months ago I went on a stream of interviews for web companies that give programming and coding tests and I knew I would blow them. So I would just suck it up, do them (and fail) and then I would go home and learn whatever it is I was being tested on so I can parallel my skill set with the job market. I make a habit of doing that now on every job interview/test I go on. If I fail ( which I usually do), I just make sure I make a compartmentalized note of what they're looking for, then I go home and learn it - even if it takes me weeks or months.

Oprofile might work without kernel hardware support, I'm not sure.<p>I don't know about shader profiling. GDB is apparently supported for debugging, haven't used it: <a href=""http://www.kandroid.org/online-pdk/guide/debugging_gdb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kandroid.org/online-pdk/guide/debugging_gdb.html</a><p>EDIT: By the way, depending on the accuracy you require, you might want to take a look at this poor man's profiler that Mike Dunlavey has been advocating:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/375913/what-can-i-use-to-profile-c-code-in-linux/378024#378024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/375913/what-can-i-use-to-...</a>
It doesn't require compiling the operating system, you can just send a kill signal to your process multiple times and examine the stack traces from the logs. It may or may not be enough for your needs.",1362910099

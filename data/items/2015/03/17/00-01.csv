9215625,comment,9214078,9214078,0,0,rcheu,,,"I&#x27;ve always been suspicious of these types of broad psychology studies.  They always seem to make claims that go beyond what their data says.<p>Laboratory experiments where the people know it&#x27;s an experiment don&#x27;t seem like they should be able to say things like &quot;rich people act meaner.&quot;  There&#x27;s just so many variables that could be different--for example rich people might be more competitive and a lab environment makes them feel more like they&#x27;re playing a game than dealing with real wealth and well being.<p>For the car experiment, he&#x27;s not really looking at rich people, he&#x27;s looking at people who choose to buy an expensive looking car and live in the Bay Area.  Notably, there are a number of people who live in the bay area, are quite wealthy, and drive a car that doesn&#x27;t show off their wealth. He also says &quot;hundreds&quot; in the video when his paper[1] says 152, notably with n=5 for those with a car rated 1.  The methodology also states that they didn&#x27;t actually record the car type, they just guessed based the cost at the time based on what they saw.<p>They claim the observer was blind to the study&#x27;s hypothesis, but the task was to record on a scale of 1-5 how expensive he or she thought the car was and whether they stopped for a pedestrian.  It doesn&#x27;t take half a brain to figure out what the hypothesis they were testing was.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/109/11/4086.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/109/11/4086.full.pdf+html</a>",1426553978

9215615,comment,9210285,9212352,0,0,avsbst,,,"Because the assignments, section material, grading infrastructure, handouts, teacher training material, and institutional knowledge for this class are all built around Java when the class switched over in the early 2000s. In the past, couple years the process of changing just one assignment out of the six or seven assignments was difficult for everyone involved (teaching staff and students). Changing the entire class would require monumental effort, and it would have to be driven by a majority contingent of the half dozen professors / lecturers involved in the introductory CS community at Stanford.<p>Given that the class has been successful at teaching programming methodology to tens of thousands of beginner students over the past decade there&#x27;s no pressing need to restructure the entire course, even though everyone does acknowledge that Python or some other language could be better for new students. It&#x27;s basically like any other large software project, yeah it could be rewritten from scratch and modernized to make small gains, but if it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it, especially when the professors and TAs have other projects that have far more interest in, like this paper.<p>Also one thing that many people don&#x27;t know is that CS106A actually changes the language environment as well as providing a modified version of Eclipse to remove some of the less useful overhead in Java (for example removing main, and the beginner confusion surrounding keyword static, arrays and arguments). Also there&#x27;s a much simpler introductory class called CS105/101 that uses Python.<p>Source: I taught sections and managed the TAs for the introductory classes over the course of four years while I was a student at Stanford.",1426553842

9215605,comment,9212432,9214777,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"> You have a VERY rosy eyed view of what cities were like before the car.  What they were actually like is rivers of mud mixed with horse manure. There were just as many roads before as now, except they were very dirty.<p>I was actually worried my point may come across like this and considered clarifying, but I figured it would be obvious with even a moment&#x27;s thought that I&#x27;m not suggesting literally reverting to exactly how roads were before cars.  The only point I was making with respect to the way roads were used was that they were closer to public spaces than the situation we have now.  Roads today are reserved pretty much exclusively for vehicles:  just try dawdling or having a conversation on a major street in any city to see what I mean. If you RTFA, Hamburg is planning to replace the massive amount of space wasted by roads with green spaces.  Relying on things like underground subways or elevated monorails or (much much much smaller than roads) bike paths means we can have the best of both worlds: undo the disastrous damage that cars did to city planning and public spaces without giving up the incredible benefits of streamlined transportation that cars enabled.<p>> Absolute nonsense. Go read some history, or even fictionalized accounts. Roads were never public spaces like you imagine. They were roads, and carts and horses routinely road right over people who didn&#x27;t get out of the way.<p>Absolute nonsense. Go read some history, or even fictionalized accounts.  Roads were public spaces almost exactly as I described them, since what I said was that vehicle traffic existed alongside people strolling and standing and doing whatever the hell else.  As I mentioned above, we&#x27;ll even be getting rid of the vehicle-induced downsides of these previous spaces (the mess and the danger), since vehicle traffic will be completely excluded from the road-replacements being described in the article.<p>We&#x27;re lucky enough to have video from the early 1900s[1], which shows exactly what I mean about roads essentially being extensions of the way sidewalks are today (+ vehicle traffic), as opposed to the &quot;all vehicles except for crosswalks&quot; style we have today.<p>By the way, I notice that the only thing you addressed in your entire response was nitpicking (an inaccurate interpretation of) my unimportant supporting comment about how roads previously were.  As I said before, the only thing I was alluding to was the fact that they were space that you could actually use, spend time on, play on, etc, as opposed to the reserved-for-cars and much-more-dangerous-for-pedestrians streets we have in the modern era. I can only assume you fully agree with the _actual_ point of my comment, which is that talking about giving up the advantages that efficient transit has bought is either disingenuous or idiotic, since that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s being discussed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJfTa5SjDCY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJfTa5SjDCY</a>",1426553632

9215590,comment,9214078,9215488,0,0,Natsu,,,"From the small cross-section of lower income people I personally knew while working for a factory, there were several people held back by their record, several held back by various substance abuse issues (including some issues which were ongoing and others that led to direct problems at work/getting fired), and at least one person born to a well-off family who was completely unable to support himself due to various anger/substance issues.<p>The longer-term employees (i.e. the most responsible of the bunch, due to selection effects) were, in general, able to move up a little.  Their kids have some hope of ending up with much better jobs than their parents.  They really were moving on up and I did what I could to help those I could help that happen.<p>The less responsible folks were drinking away their paychecks for the most part.  Several of them migrated to other, similar jobs after weeks or months after failing to show up to work after getting paid a few times.  This is a common enough occurrence that people have little doubt about what a no-call, no-show means in those circumstances on average and they do not permit such things to become regular.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful that better access to internet education will allow the more industrious among those who have been trapped by their circumstances to move beyond them.

I&#x27;ve given this some thought and here&#x27;s my belief:<p>You grow up and for whatever reason, your ambition is to accumulate wealth. You make sacrifices. You invest yourself. You trade years; your 20s, your 30s. You make a fortune.<p>Your bank account is full, but to your surprise you&#x27;re still hungry. The money you&#x27;ve been chasing your whole life, it turns out, does not have magical powers to make you happy. The thing that was supposed to offer you fulfillment and peace didn&#x27;t work. And that sucks. You deny it, for years probably, or forever. And you get angry about it. Lashing out. High taxes and entitlements are the problem, or pan handlers, welfare and obamacare, all the people with their hands in your pocket.

But the point is that landlords can take advantage of the asymmetry in cost/difficulty of changing places to hike rents. Nobody would move because the landlord was charging them $1/yr above what they could pay elsewhere. Most would move if it were double.

9215533,comment,9206782,9208454,0,0,rsc,,,"Re command line vs scripts, I am not convinced that the mental overhead of knowing two names for each flag and flipping back and forth when you context switch between the command line and a shell script really makes that much sense. Certainly common flags should be short and less common flags need not be, but personally I&#x27;d rather have one way to spell each. Certainly having just one name per flag is more in keeping with Go trying to keep things simple.<p>My officemate is a long-time Git user but was surprised the other day to see me type &quot;git pull -r&quot;. He didn&#x27;t know that -r was short for --rebase, and in fact I didn&#x27;t know that --rebase was long for -r. This kind of mutual incomprehensibility is a tiny variant of the observation that every C++ programmer uses only a small subset of C++, but the problem is that each programmer chooses a different subset. Not having two names for a flag can be a feature.<p>Re typing, I am also not convinced that the overhead of rm -r -f vs rm -rf is really that high. Of course, rm is a bad example: if you are implementing rm, you MUST use the Unix conventions and accept -rf. But for new commands not burned into decades-old muscle memory, it&#x27;s not clear that it&#x27;s needed.<p>I think there are multiple valid design decisions that could be made here, and we&#x27;ve tried to tilt the balance toward simplicity, but of course other balances could be struck, and maybe in other contexts it might make sense to strike a different one.<p>I tried to make sure it was possible that someone could write a package (say, flg) with the following API (and nothing else):<p><pre><code>    // Package flg implements a getopt-compatible command line flag parser.\n    package flg\n    \n    // Parse parses the command-line flags defined in package flag.\n    // In contrast to flag.Parse, Parse imposes getopt semantics:\n    //	- single letter flag names must be specified with a single dash: -x\n    //	- longer names must be specified with a double dash: --long\n    //	- the argument to a single-letter flag can follow it immediately:\n    //	  -xfoo means -x foo when -x takes an argument.\n    //	- multiple short flags can be combined: -xyz means -x -y -z,\n    //	  when neither -x nor -y takes an argument.\n    //	- name aliases can be introduced by calling Alias before Parse\n    func Parse()\n    \n    // Alias records new as an alias for the flag named old.\n    // Typically old is a long name and new is a single-letter name or vice versa.\n    // For example, Alias(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;recursive&quot;).\n    func Alias(new, old string) \n</code></pre>\nI believe it is, although I haven&#x27;t seen one.

Emacs doesn&#x27;t do many things badly, it does many things better than the alternatives :)<p>E.g. take one case, recurring appointments.  You can do the usual (monthly, weekly, etc.) or embed a snippet of Lisp code in your org-mode file; if it evaluates true when your agenda is being generated, then the item is deemed to be repeating that day.<p>So, let&#x27;s say you want your calendar to contain an event if the weather is forecast to be over 40 degrees C on that particular day[1].  Easy if you&#x27;re using org-mode, but basically impossible with every other system I&#x27;ve seen.<p>The point behind using a programmable editor is that their programmability allows you to extend them in ways that their original creators never intended.  Whereas, say, a conventional email client is designed to be used in just the way its creators intended, and never extended.<p>I gave a presentation on this topic (the power of programmable UIs) a while back:<p><a href=""https://github.com/duncan-bayne/presentations/blob/master/programmable-interface/programmable_interfaces.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/duncan-bayne/presentations/blob/master/pr...</a><p><i>Edited to add</i>: in fact, lack of programmability is basically what&#x27;s broken about modern computing environments.  People are so used to software being non-programmable that they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing.  It&#x27;s no accident that even rudimentary programmable environments like Excel are so popular.<p>[1] ... which is a reasonable requirement for me; the work done by the systems I help to build is highly dependant upon weather.",1426552004

Isn&#x27;t that what most people assume to begin with?<p>> This is interesting because it would imply that in the natural state of things, men&#x27;s primary family purpose is/was as a provider/protector of some sort. So as that need diminishes, perhaps it shouldn&#x27;t be the norm to expect everyone to get married.<p>On the other hand, <i>nurturing</i> functions have also to a degree been delegated to kindergartens, daycare and schools.<p>And divorce courts still seem to want that sweet dough from the primary income provider when a divorce does happen.

To that I would ask if any creature, sentient or otherwise, can be said to act free from its &quot;programming&quot;, genetic, cultural, etc.<p>Alternately maybe you think sentience would be necessary for an entity to perform unexpected actions in furtherance of subgoals (a weaker interpretation of &quot;intention&quot;). Or conversely: without sentience, computers can only perform actions which are trivial consequences of the orders they have been given. But, of course, even computers today do all kinds of things &quot;automatically&quot;.

This approach would be faster and almost certainly more robust, similar to how most latex build scripts look at the fls recorder file for the list of external includes.<p>The only only thing you can&#x27;t get will be the user-defined macros (and of course bib entries that doesn&#x27;t already exist), but there is already a consistent mechanism to define your own macros in SM via the &quot;math_def&quot; block. They &quot;do the right thing&quot; in the sense that if you render to latex snippets then it wouldn&#x27;t redundantly include these macros in the output.",1426550423

Take it or leave it.<p>I don't watch TV and the upside is: more time, more reading, more creativity. The downside is: when a friend asks ""did you see ..?"" and I have to explain why I didn't, then listen to his description of what it was I should have seen, then why it was incredibly funny, then pretend to get the joke when I have no idea WTF he's talking about. What I really mean is that not engaging in TV is culturally isolating sometimes, but I can live with that.",1210425113

979117,comment,978910,978910,0,0,owinebarger,,,"I posted this response in LTU, but it bears repeating.<p>Orthogonality (or representational independence), not size, is the relevant criteria. Harmonic analysis is the appropriate comparison. While every complete basis can represent any function in the relevant function space, it is better at representing some than others; notably the functions which are a finite linear combination of the basis functions. So trigonometric series represent one kind of function very efficiently, wavelets another. It's similar with programming languages.<p>Of course the orthogonal core may be mostly of interest to the language implementer,as orthogonality should, in the most faithful sense of the word, make the implementation of one construct independent of implementing another construct, particularly in optimization.",1260071734

979102,comment,978643,978950,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"> That linux hasn't become dominant on the desktop can (to a large extent) be attributed to the entrenched desktop market where people and organizations use the same system (and applications) over many years.<p>Its inferiority in most arenas of modern desktop usage explains its failure better.<p>> When selecting a new OS, vendors will evaluate two main elements - price and control. Pricing usually being bound to licenses (a form of control held by a third party), it usually just boils down to control.<p>I agree that vendors will look at price. But it's less obvious to me that control is important to them. I would think that software people are willing to pay a lot of money for would be more valuable.<p>> top-of-the-line R&D<p>Almost. Almost top-of-the-line.

979099,comment,978940,978940,0,0,dasht,,,"So, a box fan that looks roughly like the one pictured seems (from a quick poking around) like it uses 80-150 Watts.  Intuitively (not measured, not scientific - just a hypothesis) it seems like a box fan will also move much more air than is really optimal for this application.  Also, optimal results are probably obtained by drawing in air close to the ground and forcing it up through the radiator, not grabbing air from all around and pushing it through.<p>This seems like an area for experimentation, modeling, and maybe even product design.  Would a few computer cooling fans produce as much benefit at a fraction of the electricity cost?  Even better, maybe, can a very quiet and just-enough air circulation be built that operates solely on the thermal energy generated near the hot input side of the radiator?   A probably absurd suggestion but I can think of one past apartment where I would have considered it:  duct work (e.g., dryer vent tubes) combined with computer cooling fans drawing air from the coldest part of the apt. and pushing it towards the radiator....",1260070784

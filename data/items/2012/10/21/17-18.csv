4680280,comment,4679864,4679864,0,0,thrwaway1,,,"This reminds me of the story of Dr. Ben Carson, a famous neurosurgeon who also teaches oncology at John Hopkins.  In 2002, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and successfully underwent traditional treatment.<p>However, Dr. Carson has stated publicly, both at conferences and on radio interviews, that he believes he was largely cured by a controversial holistic treatment called glyconutrients.<p>However, due to legal liabilities on the company's part, they banned all testimonials and would threaten lawsuits to anyone who publicized this information.<p>20/20 did a story on glyconutrients, disproving them based on glycobiologist Dr. Ronald Schnaar from John Hopkins School of Medicine.  Dr. Schnaar said, ""All of the sugar building blocks that we need in our body are made from the most common foods we eat.""<p>Contrary to this, Dr. Carson says we do not get these simple sugars from our natural diet and said that his family, his employees and everyone he knows uses glyconutrients with great results.<p>He said he considered not having traditional surgery but he didn't want others mistakenly following his path to the detriment of their health.<p>Dr. Carson is not a glycobiologist.  However, he is the Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at John Hopkins and a colleague of Dr. Schanaar.  He's been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and had a film made about his life story starring Cuba Gooding Jr.<p>But none of this information about his alternative cancer treatment is widely known.  Not one word on his Wikipedia page (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Carson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Carson</a>) nor on the page about glyconutrients.<p>It's disappointing there's no unbiased scientific research to explain what is factually true.

The 'trick' was, as answer #2 elided, to use bits to store the fact that you had observed the number and then you could dump them back in sorted order.<p>So imagine you have a bit field where 'one bits' indicate you have seen the number and 'zero bits' indicate you haven't. And you compress it with run-length encoding.<p>Your initial data structure is '99999999:0' (all zeros, haven't seen any numbers) and then lets say you see the number 3,866,344 so your data structure becomes '3866343:0,1:1,96133654:0' as you can see the numbers will always alternate between number of zero bits and number of '1' bits so you can just assume the odd numbers represent 0 bits and the even numbers 1 bits. This becomes (3866343,1,96133654)<p>Anyway, as you get numbers you will split and coalesce the bit space until you've either seen all numbers (0, 99999999) or you run out of memory because a hacker has sent you only the even numbers from the space.<p>Its a clever 'math trick' which explores how you think about numbers (are they a thing or a representation).

The problem with math education lies as much with teachers as it does with students.<p>If you have students that cannot understand basic formulas and memorize them, you are not going to teach them abstract concepts. Concrete math is much easier than abstract math for the vast majority of people. I cannot really believe the stories about people who are supposedly talented at math but are not engaged enough by the school curriculum and consequently fail at the tests. School level math is very easy for anyone with some aptitude for math. Anyone who fails it will probably have even greater difficulties with abstract concepts behind it.<p>That gifted students are not stimulated enough is the real problem. Math classes for gifted children is probably the only solution. Something like Stuyvesant High in New York City but on a wider scale.<p>As for better math education in Singapore and Taiwan, well, they do have better students than most US public schools. Both genetics and culture play a role here. Asian people have both higher average IQs and higher average conscientiousness. Their teachers are able to teach math at a higher level. US could surely learn from them, but not every school could use their techniques.",1350841430

I used to file his grant applications into the office file drawers as a duty of my part-time job while pursuing my undergraduate degree. Michael Levitt is perhaps the world's leading authority on intestinal gas and still has an active research program in diseases of the human bowel. He indeed has seen many patients at a research hospital over the years, the same hospital where my mother worked as a nurse for most of her career.<p>Dr. Levitt writes in the submitted article, ""Overnight admission to the hospital is recommended for 'observation' and rest prior to the trip home. Fifty years of experience have taught me that admission to an academic hospital is not restful. I have stopped counting the patients who want to be discharged to get some rest."" I have an immediate family member who was given excellent care at the same academic hospital Dr. Levitt knows so well. My relative is in excellent health now decades after that treatment. But indeed, even with best care, the patient experience at a research hospital is not restful, as world experts on the patient's case vie with medical students and a variety of other health science trainees and practitioners to learn from the patient. When a case is puzzling, as was the case of my relative, research-oriented practitioners are curious about how to understand the case, trying to find established, verified practice to help the patient, and otherwise working ""empirically"" (an ominous word--to me--used by my relative's main doctor to describe a procedure he attempted when he wasn't sure what to do next) to do whatever they can to help.<p>As the father of a daughter, I can hardly imagine a rougher kind of news to hear. Another immediate relative lost a fiancee to cancer years ago, and that relative's memories of that time are full of frustration. The various kinds of cancer are still so varied--as mentioned in the article--that there is essentially NIL prospect of ever having a general treatment that will be an effective first-line treatment for most forms of cancer. Instead, there will continue to be surgical treatment for come cancers, a growing variety of chemotherapies for a variety of cancers, in the best luck genome-matched to vulnerable cancer cell strains, and radiation treatment for other cancers.<p>Ultimately, though, we will all have to learn to die better,<p><a href=""http://zocalopublicsquare.org/thepublicsquare/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die/read/nexus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zocalopublicsquare.org/thepublicsquare/2011/11/30/how...</a><p>because we will all eventually die of something.

4680188,comment,4679801,4680078,16,0,quantumet,,,"No, there's no real worry of that, barring some serious revolution in deconvolution. Existing techniques can only deal with blurs of certain kinds, and theory suggests that the standard blurs used for faces/etc are in fact not reversible at all.<p>A short explanation can be done using the Fourier transform. Blurs like Gaussian blur, and photographic camera blurs (with some simplifying assumptions) are convolutions; they apply a 'blur kernel' to each pixel of the image, which spreads energy from that pixel to all the neighboring pixels based on the shape of the kernel. Visualizing the outcome of a convolution is not straightforward for complex scenes, but here the Fourier transform helps.<p>When looked at in the frequency domain, the convolution operator turns into a multiplication operator; the spectrums of the image and the blur kernel are simply multiplied frequency-by-frequency. So you can directly see where information is being lost in the final image, by seeing what frequencies of the blur kernel are zero - at those frequencies, the output image has lost all original information.<p>Deconvolution techniques are all trying to restore the original image; in theory all you need to do is to take the blur kernel, and divide by its frequency spectrum to obtain the original.  Assuming you have no noise, etc, in the process, this works fine, except where the blur kernel is zero - division by zero doesn't get you very far, and the information there is truly lost.<p>With camera handshake, the shape of the blur kernel tends to be a squiggle (the path of the camera motion), and the frequency spectrum is reasonably nicely behaved - there may be no zeros or just a few spots. So reversing the blur is possible, maybe with some additional interpolation to cover up the nulls.  Out-of-focus blur (bokeh) is much harder, since it tends to be much more uniform and smooth, like a gaussian blur.<p>A gaussian blur turns out to have a gaussian frequency spectrum as well - that means the blur kernel has 0 frequency content past a cutoff point, and the wider the blur, the lower the frequency cutoff, and the more information is lost. So deconvolution can't really work directly; you can make assumptions about what was there before (priors), to guide the reconstruction. But at some point it's about as good as pasting a random face from the internet on the blurred head. The question is mostly about where that cutoff is - how much can your knowledge of 'this is a face' make up for the zeroed-out information? In practice, you're probably pretty safe if you've blurred the face to the point where no features remain. If you're really worried about it, throwing in some random noise, etc, makes the problem even more impossible.<p>So in short: We can probably do OK on camera shake and maybe out-of-focus bokeh. We can't recover from smooth uniform blurs like gaussian blurs.",1350840867

As important as programming is in our world, only a small fraction of high school graduates are going to need to do what we currently think of as ""programming"", while everyone will need to interact with technology and understand the world quantitatively. That calls for a much broader view of math and technology education than just ""programming"", even including machine learning and statistics.<p>Also, expecting anyone to have any kind of understanding of machine learning and statistics without a real grasp of what is currently considered ""mathematics"" doesn't make any sense to me.

Not to take the fun out of the story (and it might be true!), those kingpins -- along with a lot of other Model T parts -- are still in use and on the road today, almost a hundred years later in some cases.<p>Good Model T enthusiasts and restorers try to use as many original parts as possible, not just because it adds to the vehicle's antiquity, but also because the old parts actually seem to be more reliable than the hundred-year-old parts. For example, during Model T production (I don't remember what year), Ford engineered a rear axle shaft that would twist under extreme stress instead of breaking, helping mud-stuck T's get out with less risk of an expensive repair. (Hill climbs are still a popular hobbyist thing with these cars.)<p>Typically it's the sheet metal on a T that is in the worst shape -- lots of blister rust, pinholes, dents and warps and so on. Even then, an accomplished welder or backyard blacksmith can have a fender fixed up in about an afternoon and ready for its first finishing step.<p>Paint, too, was different. Certainly it was a bigger environmental problem, and we've switched paint formulations and techniques for good reason; still, you never see paint coming off of old Ts in flakes and chips. Instead you'll see a spiderweb series of cracks and a sort of a lackluster dull finish that can sometimes be spiffed up with a few hours of buffing and polishing.<p>Intellectually I get why the automotive industry has moved the way it has -- modern cars are safer, more comfortable, and much more efficient -- but it's also easy to see why old car guys are so annoyed with modern vehicles.

In the state of nature, people like me would not be at the top of the economic hierarchy. Those gangs on the south side of Chicago, lording over their impoverished little domains, would instead lord over me.<p>We, through the government, impose rules that favor the smart over the strong, that favor creation over acquisition. These rules enable the wealth of our society. But they are not cost-less, nor are they the natural order of things. There is a large class of losers in this system, and I consider government spending that redistributes some of the fruits of societal production to be part of the cost of imposing these rules.<p>Moreover, many of these expenditures benefit businesses directly. Public education is an enormous subsidy to the business world. My firm's clients are all large companies that collectively employee millions of people educated on the public dime. Since our economy is built on mental activity, rather than manual labor, it is of enormous benefit to companies to have readily available educated employees. Moreover, many items of spending, such as food aid, primarily go to children. It is a tremendous benefit to the business world to have a next-generation workforce that doesn't suffer from the cognitive issues that can result from malnutrition.<p>The expenditures that are the hardest to justify are the ones that are generationally redistributive, like Social Security and Medicare. On the other hand, these require the least justification--they are benefits mostly paid for by separately-marked taxes, that every taxpayer can benefit from personally.<p>And I'm not even going to get started on how tremendously economically valuable agencies like the EPA are.<p>So before you talk about what our taxes are spent on, try to cultivate some perspective about what exactly enables the incredible wealth we have in our society. As I said, my parents are from a country with far less government than we have. It's hellish. You don't want to live like that, trust me.",1350839381

If you're marketing something you need to be sure the users who might buy it, will look at it, and to do that you want to be sure the user discrimination factors are in the headline/lede. So if, as a marketeer, your research shows that consumers shop based on 'brand', 'os', and 'size' you want to make sure your headlines include 'Google' 'Android' and '10'. As others have pointed out 'Nexus' is fast becoming an identifier as 'Google's preferred flavor of Android' so replacing Android with Nexus in the headline is OK too.<p>Because there isn't a lot of 'control' in the size market at Google (remember that Dell launched the first 7"" Android device?)

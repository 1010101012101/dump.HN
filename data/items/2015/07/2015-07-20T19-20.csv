So please don&#x27;t lecture me on stuffing words into people&#x27;s mouths.<p>Now as to the actual discussion, you said that if we don&#x27;t keep pride in mind, it will be difficult to get officers to reform. You further presented the example of the Baltimore drive-by which the police refused to respond to after their pride had been hurt. That, to me, sounds like you&#x27;re saying that if we hurt police pride they will turn on us by failing to obey us and by failing to protect us. Is that not what you meant?<p>As for my &quot;awesome leadership skills,&quot; are you saying that firing police officers who refuse to respond to an incident because they have hurt feelings due to protests is the wrong action to take? If I understand that correctly, please elaborate. In any other job, refusing to do perform a critical duty required by your job without a very good reason is generally a firing offense.

In particular, the &quot;red line&quot; in Syria and the (effective) capitulation to Russia over Ukraine feel eerily similar to the run-up to WWII, where the Allies capitulated to Hitler rather than go to war and ended up going to war when Germany was a lot stronger and harder to counter. In contrast, the situation of the Cuban missile crisis was resolved in large part by JFK refusing to let the USSR declare a new normal.<p>As a thought experiment, do you think that Putin would have attempted to dislodge Crimea from Ukraine or Assad would have used chemical weapons had Bush still been in power?

Their motivations are not going to be in line with those of the average American. Their lives could span milliseconds, or aeons. Their brain could function at so extremely different rates than ours, that we or they wouldn&#x27;t consider each other sentient.

Our typical test urine and saliva took 3 major steps.<p>1) Negative Screening (6hrs) - Figuring out what compounds show up initially. Special dyes were use to identify potential compounds.  Not conclusive but narrows down the next steps<p>2) Extraction (10 - 18 hrs) - Separate the target compounds from the rest of compounds/proteins in the sample fluid.<p>3) Postive Certification via GCMS (2hrs - 16hrs) - The extracted compounds were ionized (broken into predictable pieces) then sent through the GCMS to where a signal signature determined.<p>Each step included equipment expensive materials and equipment.  The last step is was the most expensive and error prone. The GCMS machines need maintenance and calibration. They cost anywhere from $30,000 to $70,000.<p>Sometimes we lost samples because the machine would lose it&#x27;s calibration and wouldn&#x27;t be enough to start another set. We took in samples on a national scale, but I can see how a smaller non-commercial lab accumulate a large backlog.<p>This was like 10 years ago but I don&#x27;t see the technology changing that much.",1437421799

9918543,comment,9914534,9916949,0,0,deckiedan,,,"Hm.  Maybe I made myself unclear - I was meaning to be specifically in response to the parent post, who said that only knowing 10% made him feel empowered.<p>I was meaning, in a sense, that it&#x27;s better to have a language which doesn&#x27;t have such a complex history, undefined behaviour, and weird syntactic trivia.<p>The simpler the language, the less unexpectedness occurs, and the more you can concentrate on the actual logic and meaning.<p>For instance, in English, &quot;homosexual&quot; = attracted sexually to those who are the same (&quot;homo&quot;) gender as yourself.  But &quot;homophobic&quot; does not mean hating/fearing those the same gender as yourself.  The rules are complex, with history, weirdness, and are confusing.<p>The same with programming languages, I feel.  Take JS, for instance.<p><pre><code>    >>> (0 == [])
    true
    
    >>> typeof (0 + 0)
    &quot;number&quot;

    >>> typeof ([] + [])
    &quot;string&quot;
</code></pre>
There is no reason on earth I want to know that stuff or operator precedence rules.  I can never remember those if I need to do a `x * y + 2 z --` and so always write in brackets explicitly.  But the language <i>can</i> accept such things, and make an order from them.<p>Going back to C (sorry for jumping around), yes, it&#x27;s simple compared to C++, or many other languages, but it does have a lot of history, undefined behaviour, and stuff you simply need to be aware of.  And it&#x27;s that stuff that makes life complex for C beginners (and allows bugs for C of all experience levels).  There&#x27;s a reason I didn&#x27;t list C as a simple language. :-)<p>If our languages didn&#x27;t have such quirks, and we didn&#x27;t have to cope with working around them, a lot less mistakes would be made.  <a href=""http://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/to-table.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/to-...</a>  for instance, in English.<p>English - the Javascript of the human languages.",1437421745

And given time we can figure out how to understand that which we can observe. And more generally, even if it manages to jump straight to communicating in some other dimension without letting us see its intermediate work, it seems very likely that whatever it is doing will have observable effects within the realm of the physics we understand and can observe (even if it&#x27;s just EM radiation). At the very least, we can tell that it&#x27;s there and that it&#x27;s doing something and start figuring out what it is doing.<p>This is in contrast to the ants of Michio Kaku, who <i>don&#x27;t even know anything is going on</i>. The point isn&#x27;t that the ants don&#x27;t understand how to build their own 10-lane superhighway, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t even know that this is a thing built by another species or for what purpose it was built. sixQuarks&#x27;s point (regardless of whether what he said about Elon Musk is true), summed up in his analogy about complex mathematics, is that we should still be able to observe aliens and comprehend that they&#x27;re doing something, even if we don&#x27;t necessarily understand how to do that thing ourselves.",1437421235

There&#x27;s not much guessing going on here, you are either able to define the viewport, or it will render the page at the widths specified in the page styles.

I design my stuff to work on all screen sizes smaller and larger than would be in use today so it not only shows up the same everywhere, but will continue to show up the same on devices released years from today.<p>I also regularly test on quirky hardware like PS Vita, and anything else with a browser that I can get my hands on just to make sure there aren&#x27;t any weird bugs or edge cases.<p><a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_not.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/04/a_pixel_is_n...</a><p>Here&#x27;s a real-world case study: a friend had a sign up funnel and was tracking 900 different mobile devices on his site.

However, that has proven useless in practice because, unlike Erlang, we have access to kernel scheduling, so we turned that off (I think the relevant code is still there -- it&#x27;s about ten lines). Switching off that feature was completely backed by evidence, and caused zero harm.<p>> Certainly it violates the programmer intuition invariant that she can just write programs, if she has to occasionally check on a JMX MBean to find out if the framework has pooped on the bed.<p>That is easily solvable by having Quasar automatically migrate a thread from being scheduled in user-space to being scheduled by the kernel. However, even that cool feature doesn&#x27;t justify itself, because things work great as they are. The programmer doesn&#x27;t need to check JMX occasionally. The behavior is immediately detected in testing and reported as a warning. Simple and effective. Note that all this works even if this behavior occurs in native code, which is more than Erlang does. Threads that are less suitable for user-mode scheduling must be few, and they are very easy to recognize.<p>Doing any of that automatically may be cool, but has no real value. We might do that at some point, but it&#x27;s not a high priority.<p>> as all preemption requires slicing time: that&#x27;s literally what it means.<p>No, it means that the scheduler has the ability to deschedule the thread when it wishes[1]. We have this ability, we just no longer use it on time-slices (we easily can, it&#x27;s just not helpful in the least).<p>> On the kernel scheduling piece, your argument doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. Hardware support is only tangentially to do with high thread context switching costs; and it is frequently the case that many actors can fit into cache, where many threads cannot.<p>All you say is true, yet none of it matters in practice when it comes to time-slice preemption. Only a handful of threads can enjoy that form of scheduling anyway, whether they take 10MB or 10 bytes of RAM.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)#Preemptive_multitasking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing)#Preempt...</a>",1437419191

In my experience, Typescript is far superior to Flow.<p>In terms of the sorts of errors they catch, they&#x27;re about the same. In <i>practice</i>, Flow caught essentially no real errors that Typescript did not, and vice versa. (This is based on my workflow, YMMV obviously.)<p>However, Typescript is installable through NPM and runs as a basic Node module that reads files and parses text when you call it. Flow is written in OCaml, which means it&#x27;s not available through NPM. This means either installing a separate binary (if one exists for your system) or installing an OCaml compiler so you can compile it from source. Afterwards, Flow uses a client-server setup, which makes it really annoying to run in a headless and automated environment. It&#x27;s also surprisingly slow; it took a full ten seconds to typecheck a small project the first time. Supposedly the server makes it faster to do repeated checks, but honestly, the Typescript compiler is fast enough that this seems like a solution in search of a problem.<p>Also, Flow would keep getting confused and insisted on typechecking my node_modules. This was a problem because one of my imports had a third-level dependency with syntax error in an unused test, which meant that my entire Flow typecheck would fail. I couldn&#x27;t add it to the [ignore] section of my ~/.flowconfig, because then Flow would literally pretend the file didn&#x27;t exist, and then the project wouldn&#x27;t compile due to missing imports!<p>All in all, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some way to set up flow without running into any of the above issues, but it definitely was way more work to set up (compared to a simple &#x27;npm install&#x27;), and for seemingly no benefit whatsoever.",1437418812

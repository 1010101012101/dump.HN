That probably means that it was either hand-written by Buffet or by a secretary (or stenographed or whatever), and then given to a typist to format.<p>In turn that means that some random lowly typist got to snoop on all this premium investment advice, that 20 years later would be becoming common wisdom.  I wonder if she (I assume a typist in the 70s would be female) noticed and appreciated it, perhaps acted on it.",1376701197

That is a big difference from saying that it&#x27;s futile to play the market (since not everyone is trying to invest 20 billion).

All the other fluctuations are based on expectancies of those assets and arbitration.<p>It is entirely possible for 100% of fund managers to do below the market average, as fund managers dont own 100% of the market. \nIt is also likely they have a losing bet against a market, as active fund managers employ resources in their operations, by trading and actively managing a portfolio, usually in the form of fees, and potential downsides on extra taxation as well.<p>Tracking &quot;the winners&quot; is the most fallacious and common attempt at gauging how good a fund manager or a stock is doing. \nBernie Madoff was one of the winners for decades.

At least, they said, make sure I could get reviews out of it. That&#x27;s not policy, but advice. People have their own theories about how best to get noticed and get promoted.

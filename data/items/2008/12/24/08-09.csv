408655,comment,406329,408403,0,0,jbjohns,,,"I'm sorry, I have to (strongly) disagree.  I used Perl professionally for 5+ years.  I was the one that always added bindings to C and C++ libraries.  I wrote a massive OO network management system that used all kinds of meta-magic (keep in mind this was long before Moose, etc.) to deal with new kinds of computers coming into the system automatically that is, afaik, still running.<p>And I'll never use Perl again for anything on purpose.  I'm not a Python fanboy, but I don't find your library comment right at all.  In fact, the time I used Python was because I had to add functionality to an older Perl project.  Rather then write in Perl I rewrote the entire thing in Python (that is; I chose to use a language I didn't know at the time, rather then write Perl again).  The resulting source code was one third the size (I counted) and much much clearer with more features added.  I didn't have to download anything for Python while the old Perl code was using 4 or 5 CPAN modules.<p>As for Java/Haskell, this is obviously not a fair comparison:  Perl+CPAN vs. Java/Haskell <i>standard</i> libraries.  If you include third party libraries for Java it should have far more code then any other language by now.",1230108929

408651,comment,407241,407367,0,0,mhartl,,,"I omitted detail for brevity.  Of course debt isn't always bad.  But ""too much"" debt is.  How much is ""too much""?  That's complicated.  So I simplified.  That being said, going into (mainly credit card) debt to buy TVs and iPods and widgets, which lots of people having been doing for years, is almost always ""too much"".<p><i>If the resulting payoff is greater than the debt, then absolutely it makes sense to go into debt.</i><p>I agree: <i>if</i>. But government lacks the proper incentives to ensure that the benefits justify the costs.",1230108515

Most of my friends have one and every game I've plaid on one of their systems was amazing.

408633,comment,408420,408574,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Andrew Conru had several web businesses that were contemporaneous with the start of Yahoo. I worked with him for few months at W3.com (not current owner of site but a company that built websites for Egghead, New Media Magazine and others) in 94/95. It was at the start of the first dotcom era in Palo Alto. I was not involved in AFF which he started later. Conru was in the Mechanical Engineering PhD program at Stanford and could well have known the Yahoo guys.<p>EDIT: here is a pointer to original W3.com products <a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_17179339"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_17179339</a>",1230106412

408629,comment,408420,408420,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I've always wondered how AFF can possibly maintain a number of users for long. Even average women can just walk into a bar/bookstore/coffee shop/etc. and find a man on any given night with very little effort, which means that site couldn't have much of a selection of females participating. I assume the same is largely true of gay men. So you're left with a large amount of straight men looking for women that probably aren't there.<p>So I could see how they could lure in a lot of straight men with the promise of casual sex, just not how they could keep the enormous churn rate down when they found they were barking up an empty tree. Maybe they just haven't burned through 100% of the population quite yet, and want to IPO so they can cash out before they do, or maybe just a lot of people have lower standards (even when sober) than I would have guessed. Or maybe AFF is nothing but a ruse to lure men into porn sites they own, since you'd probably prefer it to your options there.",1230105751

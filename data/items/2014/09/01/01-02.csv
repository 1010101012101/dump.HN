8251208,comment,8248359,8250134,1,0,andrewfong,,,"> Yes, but you&#x27;re confused about the meaning of &quot;actual copying&quot;. Any method that substantially reproduces the original constitutes actual copying.<p>Nope, you&#x27;re flat out wrong and I&#x27;ll stake my bar license on it. Actual copying requires that &quot;the defendant actually used the plaintiff’s work in order to create his or her own work.&quot;[1] Courts typically require proof of &quot;access to the copyrighted work&quot; <i>in addition to</i> substantial similarity between the results.[2] Substantial similarity can help constitute <i>circumstantial evidence</i> of copying but does not indicate infringement in and of itself.[3]<p>---<p>>> That doesn&#x27;t mean you can get around the Happy Birthday copyright[2] by simply randomly generating six note sequences until you get the one you want.<p>> That is absolutely false, and I am shocked that you would post this nonsense in a public forum. The result is the only issue -- if it&#x27;s a copy of a protected work, no one asks how the copy was generated.<p>Read my original quote again. I think you missed the <i>&quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot;</i> in my statement. We&#x27;re in agreement that randomly generating content until it resembles a copyrighted work will get you in trouble, albeit for different reasons.<p>---<p>>> On the other hand, let&#x27;s say you somehow never heard the Happy Birthday song and somehow just came up with them on their own. That&#x27;s fine -- no copying, no infringement.<p>> Also false, as much case law demonstrates. The difference in the case of simultaneous invention is the severity of the punishment, not the judgment that it&#x27;s a violation.<p>Can you point out a single case where that&#x27;s true? There&#x27;s at least one appellate level case saying the opposite (albeit with 3 notes, not 6):<p>&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;[D]efendant submitted affidavits by experts analyzing the two compositions and showing that the only similarity between them is a recurring three note sequence found also in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. The evidence presented clearly does not raise a question of fact as to whether the two compositions were so strikingly similar as to preclude the possibility of independent creation.&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;[4]<p>You may be confusing patent law with copyright. Under patent law, independent invention is no defense (except as to damages). But copyright law != patent law (unfortunately IMHO -- some semblance of an independent invention requirement would make patent trolling less profitable).<p>---<p>Citations:<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/the_101_201_practice_series/elements_of_a_copyright.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications...</a><p>[2] See, e.g., Sid & Marty Krofft Television v.

8251207,comment,8250270,8250495,2,0,morgante,,,"> No one hired a ghost writer, all of them wrote their own essays, but in all cases the consultant asked them to rewrite 5 or 6 times, at least. There it is where it seems to exist the ethical line: ghost writer, no good; rewrite yourself until every single sentence is exactly like the consultant wants, good.<p>That&#x27;s definitely where the ethical line is, and makes total sense. Nearly all professional writing you read (books, magazines, etc.) has gone through a similar process between the writer & editor. It&#x27;s totally expected, but nobody pretends it&#x27;s not still the author&#x27;s work. There are thousands of ways to write the same essay, hundreds of which are &quot;good&quot; (acceptable by the editor/consultant). But a ghostwriter only writes it one of those hundred ways, which is almost certainly not the one you would have picked.<p>It also comes down to a quest of fairness. My public school counselor happily read over a couple essay drafts. They <i>never</i> would have written one for me (that would have required hiring a ghostwriter, which I definitely couldn&#x27;t afford).<p>I hope you can see the difference.",1409536683

The first and most important step would be to get daily balances and cash flows. Next would be getting information about trades. Ultimately, of course, one would be able to make trades.

Instead, that field provides a framework for you to learn how to acquire, analyze, and summarize knowledge.<p>Hence, it&#x27;s <i>absolutely expected</i> that any educated adult should have no problem writing in an unrelated humanities field, because they&#x27;ve already gone through the system.<p>This of course doesn&#x27;t mean a random person can easily write such an essay (hence the demand for ghostwriting services). Many of my high school peers would&#x27;ve flunked out of even a basic college course. Hence, despite its apparent tedium, college does provide an important certification/funnel—even for mid-level office jobs, whose chief qualification is reading and synethsizing reports.<p>I do hope you understand how it&#x27;s unethical to aid and abet people in cheating their way through college. This does a disservice to them (they likely won&#x27;t learn the necessary writing/analysis skills for the workplace), to employers (they might be hiring incompetent writers), and to society (by credentialing the wrong people, potentially driving out smarter/more ethical people). It&#x27;s ethics 101 that claiming someone else&#x27;s work as your own is wrong.<p>> the heaviest users of the service were education majors.<p>I sadly suspect that has something to do with class dynamics. Education is not very prestigious and (based solely on the ads I see in the subway) is one of the fields (together with &quot;business administration,&quot; &quot;IT management&quot;, etc.) targeted at low-income/low-ability people who probably don&#x27;t belong in college at all.",1409536209

The particular version of the compiler you are using has to be certified, but just long as you can use the language and the compiler to meet DO-178B/C standards, you can use whatever you want. You can use whatever tools you want, if they get certified. You can write your own tools and certify them. Anything goes, just so long as it meets standards.<p>(Working on some flight management software, I found a bug in our version of GCC. It&#x27;s free software, right? So I could just fix it? Or even upgrade to a newer version? That would have meant re-certifying the compiler, so it was easier to work around the bug.)<p>In practice, I do see a lot avionics code written in Ada. I see a lot written in C. I see a lot written in C++. I haven&#x27;t seen much else. I would guess a roughly even split between Ada and C or C++, with either C or C++ being increasingly favored for new clean sheet projects.",1409535533

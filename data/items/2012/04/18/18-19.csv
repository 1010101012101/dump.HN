You seem to want to mock Keynes by picking on him as advocating ""valueless work"", but what you don't understand is that Keynes picked that example to parody the classical economists who - like you - advocated doing nothing in the face of economic collapse.<p>Digging up money is an obvious waste of time. In suggesting it, Keynes was making fun of people like Andrew Carnegie who advocated letting market forces ""liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate... [and] purge the rottenness out of the system"". Under market forces, deflation would have increased the value of gold, pushing the private sector to increase gold production and bring the economy back into equilibrium by paying people to... dig holes in the ground and produce more money.<p>The point of the parable may be less obvious today since no-one seriously advocates the restoration of the gold standard anymore, but the core insight Keynes had remains as valid today as it was then: when you are in a liquidity trap marked by deflation and insufficient demand, there is a huge free lunch to be had simply by printing money and spending it to direct unemployed labor into productive activities. This brings the economy back into equilibrium and is the reason austerity is welfare reducing. Because you advocate forcing the private sector to undertake a senseless course of painful adjustment that could be avoided simply by printing enough money to avert deflation. And whatever you spent your newly-printed money building would be a net positive, and ideally something with practical economic value driving long-term growth: a high-speed national rail-line, new schools, hospitals, etc.<p>Put more simply, Keynes' point was that the most senseless economic act you can imagine (paying people to dig holes in the ground) was still at worst merely equivalent to what the liquidationists were proposing in the 1930s.",1334775036

More importantly it has those users in the place where everyone wants to be, mobile phones.<p>So sometimes you hear complaints from technologists like this ""Hey I could write that app in a weekend, throw some EC-2 at it and blam, done. So WTF is up with that valuation?"" And that sounds a bit like saying that the New York times is just some typeset ink and pictures. Which technically is not hard to produce, but their reach in terms of audience is actually quite large. So their value is in their reach, not their technology.<p>So wired wrote [1] that Instagram has 40 million users. Lets look at them from a 'customer acquisition cost' story. Paying out 300M in cash for 40M customers is $7.50 per customer. What is the lifetime value of a Facebook customer? How about a Facebook customer on Mobile? Good question, but if you already have a kick ass display ad business (which Facebook does) and you add 40M daily users, and you tweak the product so it goes through a way that you can usefully display them an ad? Can you make that into a billion dollar a year business in 1 year? 2 years? 5 years?<p>If engineers have a blind side it's 'suits', which is to say great engineers not only have skills but they also have the intuition to know the value of the product delivered. But products only have value if people know they exist, and the cost of acquiring customers for your killer product, well it can kill your product.<p>So rather than say 'this is a stupid valuation for a nothing of a company!', lets assume that the folks at Facebook aren't complete idiots, or scheming some back room buddy deal to put one over on shareholders (which one blogger suggested), ask yourself honestly, ""A smart person looked at this deal and agreed it was worth $1B, 30% cash and 70% stock, since that makes no sense to me I need to figure out what they know that I don't know.""<p>I personally think they are interested in the customer acquisition in the mobile space (obviously :-)) but I also recognize that having been through these things in the past there is a ton of stuff that doesn't make the press, like process innovations, or specific people skills, or partnerships, etc etc.<p>The cool thing about this story is that it seems like the founders will get a bit of money 'up front' which can be re-assuring to a founder / employee.

They were still communicating theIntentOfTheVariable like they always did, but in a way that felt less helpful and more like lexical noise.<p>Code shape communicates meaning through a different channel than variable names do. As code gets less verbose, its shape emerges more and more, that channel becomes more and more informative, and one begins to use shorter names so as not to drown it out.<p>This is very different than verbose programs written in verbose languages. There, descriptiveVariableNames don't take up an unseemly amount of space relative to everything else. The shape of the code is less meaningful because you can't see the forest for the trees.

The markers of meaning they're used to relying on are missing, and their eyes haven't adjusted to the meaning that is there.

3859518,comment,3857184,3857835,3,0,0ren,,,"There could be other time-based methods to encourage students, rather than hard deadlines. For instance, suppose the class had a bag with unlimited (or large) number of question, and required each student to score 100 points to pass. Students would have unlimited number of attempts at quizzes/assignments, but their score decays with time (think HN submission ranking decay). That is, if you worked hard and scored 70, but then you were busy/away for a month, your score drops to, say, 50. So you are encouraged to finish the questions in a timely manner, but on the other hand, you can also make up for that missed month by putting more work when you are back.<p>With this method or a something similar, you do not ""lose everything"" when you miss a deadline. IMHO, ""losing everything"" for missing a deadline is part of the reason for the (exponential?) decay in the number of students participating in Coursera's PGM class[1,2].<p>[1] Based on PGM's ""quiz's highest score"" statistics, the total numbers of participating students are 6950, 3500, 2650 for week1, week2 and week3 respectively (other weeks' stats are not complete as of this writing).<p>[2] Another interesting stats is the ratio of perfect scores to all other scores: 25.2%, 34.3%, 49%. This could suggest that the deadline system filters out most students but the very top ones (assuming uniform difficulty of quizzes, and uniform quality of lecture videos/slides, etc.). This may not be what you want from an educational perspective. And, yet it may actually be what you want to support a business plan similar to Udacity- discovering talent.

It doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table and it looks exactly like java, c#, javascript, etc... and exactly for the same reasons (to be familiar for the average programmer). Syntactically, it's dull and unexciting.\nHowever, on a second thought, I changed my mind a bit.\nLike it or not, it has to be this way to gain wide adoption and, indeed, anyone with experience in java or javascript can get productive in no time with Dart.\nBut what's really interesting is the snaphot feature. Dart will load in milisecons in the browser, making startup times irrelevant.\nIt's also designed with performance in mind, and it will have some features that will make it ideal for large code basis and team work.<p>As for its boring syntax, this won't be a problem.\nCoffeescript demonstrated that you can target a messy language and make it beatiful and fun.\nDart already has a ""transpiler"" for compiling it down to javascript.\nIf Dart becomes a good compilation target (and it looks so), people will start wrting their own transpilers targeting Dart. The best of both worlds.\nAs for the concerns about the null chance of other browsers adopting Dart, this is a battle they can't win.\nDart will run everywhere, either on its own VM or compiled to javascript. And it will lead to a situation where new applications run on every browser, but ""work best on Chrome"". \nHow long will the other vendors keep on pushing a mediocre, substandard language such as javascript when Dart is already making developers lives easier, and applications faster and better?",1334774012

At different stages mock objects make sense, and at other stages having something like Fake S3 makes more sense.<p>For testing, the first stage would be unit testing.  At that stage it is best to mock out your S3 interactions (with something like VCR or WebMock) and use an OO approach to wrap your persistence, so you could swap out S3 with another persistence engine without breaking APIs.<p>The second stage for us is integration testing where you might have multiple machines testing across the network.  In this situation, I think it is great to have real network requests happening rather than mock requests.  Also you can deal with real files (especially important with media files like images and video).<p>The last stage is taking out Fake S3 and using a true S3 connection to ensure that everything does work on a production environment (cuz Fake S3 could be faking you out, especially on things like authentication and versioning).  We do that by launching a stage cluster and running a set of integration tests on that before doing a production release.  Ideally, the first and second stages catch any errors before you start doing tests against the real AWS services.<p>As for the development pipeline, being able to work with real assets while you are making mobile or web interfaces is really useful, as well as simulating latency to see how interfaces respond when under a slow network connection is something that would be difficult to truly mock.",1334773389

It's not something that's exclusive to FP.  And I'd even go a step further and suggest that excessive use of mutable state isn't a hallmark of imperative programming so much as a hallmark of <i>bad</i> imperative programming.  Though I'm sure there's also plenty of room for argument there.<p>Regardless, the fact remains that when functional programming proselytizers suggest that imperative programmers need FP to escape from the bugaboos of excessive mutability, it comes across as somewhat naive.  While many functional languages make mutability less convenient, this is not the same as making immutability more convenient.  Which I mention by way of pointing out that really the only thing people working in imperative languages need to do to cut back on their use of mutable state is <i>cut back on their use of mutable state.</i><p>Now, if the current fad for FP made more noise about something that distinguishes functional languages much more tangibly, it might be more impressive.  Take higher-order programming, something most functional languages do very well and most imperative languages do poorly (if at all).  Imagine doing something like node.js in a non-functional language.<p>Or this couple minutes from a lecture on F#, where the presenter converts sequential code to asynchronous parallel code in just a few keystrokes.

Contrast this with writing code manually for node and the browser. In this case, though it's all javascript, the programmer must explicitly divide the code for the server and the client. Or contrast with Meteor. Here there is a bit more code sharing, but the programmer still needs to think about client vs server (by checking `Meteor.is_client` and `Meteor.is_server` where appropriate).<p>In Opa (as I understand it--I haven't used it), the programmer can be explicit about where code execution should occur, but the compiler can also infer where it should occur, determine the best place to put the ""data boundary"", and warn the programmer if code is executed in an unsafe context.<p>For ""traditional"" next-gen web apps, it's a tough call that this is enough of a win to warrant learning a new language. Further, because this style of server-client programming is pretty immature, programmers may want to have tight control over where code is run.<p>However, I think this is very important work for the future of distributed computing. In particular, consider if we are ever to move from the web's dominant server-client architecture to a more fluid peer-to-peer model, with code moving from client to client where appropriate (i.e. mobile agents). For example, say my phone needs to grab some data from my laptop, but rather than have the laptop send all the raw data to my phone and have my phone process it, the system figures out that it would be more efficient for my phone to send code to my laptop, have the laptop process the data locally, then send the processed data back to my phone.<p>To be able to make inferences like in that example, I think we will need to use approaches like Opa.",1334773180

While bands on average may sell less now, how many active bands are there now than there were in, say, 1998? While sales numbers dropped, has the pool of musicians grown?</i><p>Well, it's great as a consumer since there's an endless flow of new stuff, though some critics have wondered whether there's a tendency towards the ephemeral. But people don't get into music or film or any of the other creative arts because of economics; they get into it because they have some degree of talent and a great deal of passion. The economic aspect is a secondary necessity if you want to do it full time. But a lot of people will do it for very little, hence the stereotype of the Starving Artist. It's rewarding on other levels besides the financial.<p><i>why doesn't the same idea of cheaper means extend to music production? We're not talking film scores here, so what's wrong with a bedroom mix?</i><p>It depends on who's doing the mixing. This is a particular skillset I happen to have, but it's not one that was developed easily or overnight. So the idea of cheaper means most certainly does extend to music production (and indeed film scores and so on), but you still need skill to exploit the means. If I give you a Ferrari for $5, it doesn't automatically make you a good driver, does it? Likewise, you can get instruments for fairly cheap - I've got a bass guitar that cost me only $150 that I like very much. Unfortunately I'm a pretty terrible bass player, so if I was making a recording that required some great bass skills, I'd have to pay someone who had them. The low price of my guitar doesn't make it any easier to play than an instrument that costs 10x as much.<p><i>suboptimal payment processor and web host</i><p>Couldn't agree more.<p><i>(haven't seen FB since 2009-2010), what's wrong with a simple link to the Bandcamp page? After streaming a few things, are FB users just not clicking through?</i><p>I don't use FB much anymore either, but my understanding is that yes, they don't click through. Avid Facebook users want their content within Facebook's standardized UI and relatively well-curated system. Like AOL, Facebook is the online equivalent of the mall - somewhat bland, but fairly clean, safe, and above all well-organized. Myspace was just as technically impressive as Facebook back in the day, but because it included a host of customization options it wound up looking like a shopping district that had gone to seed and was covered in bad graffiti and flyposters. You could tell it was doomed when some people were making a business out of selling sparkly animated gifs as page backgrounds. Myspace was so freely customizable that browsing and navigation ended up becoming a chore for visitors; you'd go to someone's page, loud music would start, and you'd be frantically looking for the transport/volume controls - like multimedia Geocities. With Facebook you never get lost as a visitor, and if the site limits a page owner's visual expression somewhat, the same is true for everyone else so you're not at a real disadvantage.",1334772649

We're specifically working on ways to keep both content (blog posts, photos, status updates, etc) and datum (health info, workouts, communication data, etc) in a form where you a) have full control of the raw data and b) can make select data available to external apps which do things like presentation and analysis.<p>Our goal is to create an open-source platform to address some of these questions around data ownership, access and portability. Imagine the day when you decide that you want to move your blog from Tumblebook to Posterpress and you can do that by simply creating a new account on Posterpress and granting it access to your existing data. Or you've been using JogKeeper but then you find this great new service called SprintTracker that you want to try out - and all you need to do is connect and it will have your years worth of running data.<p>And we think that something like this will also make it much simpler for SaaS developers to compete not by customer lock-in but rather by providing superior products and continually working to make the customer happy.<p>We're taking it slowly right now to build this platform which we will open-source under a permissive license (as soon as it's a little more mature) by first building a few consumer-oriented services on top of it.

There are a few problems I see: You have tied yourself to S3's API, you must maintain this ""other"" S3 by making sure it behaves like the real S3 and your test and development code never actually hits the real API you're using...until staging or production.<p>There are a few better strategies I can see here:<p>1. For test, use something like VCR[1] to record real HTTP interactions with the real S3 API during first test runs, serialize them to disk, and then replay them later.<p>2. Go the more OO route and create an internal business object with a defined interface that handles persistance of your objects.  You could have a S3Persister for production and staging, but then you can create a LocalDiskPersister or even MemoryPersister for tests.  Hell, you can even keep your own S3 and create OurS3Persister as well.  The main point here is that your application code is coded to one API/interface - the ""persister"" - and you can easily swap in different persisters for different reasons.  All the individual persisters can then have their own tests that guarantee they adhere to to Persister interface and do their own individual things correctly.<p>3. Mock out the calls to your S3 library. It's the job of the library to provide an API interface for you as the application developer to S3, so you can mock out those API calls and trust the library works and is doing the right thing.  Since you're mocking things out, you should still have integration tests with the real S3 to verify everything is working, but for quick unit tests mocking works great.<p>The blog post mentioned they had GB of data, so YMMV on these ideas, but these are strategies I and others have used in the past when dealing with APIs like S3 and they work great.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/myronmarston/vcr</a>",1334772342

That is you had to configure each one individually. As in you could do static provisioning with a single tool across multiple boxes, but on the order of minutes between changes. If you had to create a VLAN with ten boxes, across 5 different racks, you would be spending quite a bit of time doing that, since you would need to find spare VLANs that are unused across the fabric, configure all the switches in between, etc.<p>Now with OpenFlow, all the switches are controlled by the central controller. And flow configuration is dynamic - ie you don't need to fiddle with individual configs, when the flows start, the controller is queried, and if there's an appropriate flow setup on the controller, it will be implemented, with local free VLANs, etc.<p>Basically the entire fabric becomes as dynamic & smart as the controller, instead of each switch being smart and static.",1334772123

Beacon is a perfect example of the sort of uses you can expect them to put your data to in future. All the data from like buttons, your social graph etc, is invaluable to them, and invaluable to advertisers and retailers.<p>The logical conclusion of that is they have absolutely no incentive to give you your data back, in fact they view that as <i>their</i> data, earned by offering you the service of sharing stuff with your friends, without having to set up your own website. That data is their crown jewels, so I am amazed that anyone would expect them to give it up, or be surprised at their reluctance - this is the very essence of Facebook, and they've done very well out of it.<p>That's not to say that you should never use Facebook, but just that if you do use a free service like Facebook, you should expect to give up some of your privacy and control over your data in return.

Historically, governments have granted monopoly's for various activity's, that did not mean someone needed increase prices just that they had the ability to do so should they chose.  Obviously after being granted the power most chose to exercise it and become weathly, but not all.<p>More recently manufacturing has enabled company's to create capabilities though investments that are not easy to duplicate.<p>Intel is the only company on the planet capable of manufacturing 22nm chips at scale.  Other companies can do 28nm and given time other companies will catch up.  But, their Monopoly on 22nm chips has nothing to do with patents and is dependent on the incredible multi billion dollar investments required to manufacture at such scales.  14nm  Fab's are expected cost more than 5 billion dollars per facility, and vary few institutions can afford such investments. <a href=""http://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/carl/intel-plan-fab-42-14nm-process-costing-5-billion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/carl/intel-plan-fab-42...</a><p>PS: In 5 years 22nm manufacturing will be yet another commodity process, but by then Intel will have moved on.

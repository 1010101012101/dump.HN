3871763,comment,3871692,3871710,3,0,jboggan,,,"On the other hand, the current MacBook Pro line is quite mature which translates to stability and lack of grievous hardware or firmware issues.  I'm still wary of buying a first generation Mac product after my experience purchasing a newly-unveiled Macbook (white body) in June 2006.  Between the dirty-looking discoloration of the plastic and the random auto-shutdown firmware bug that bricked my new laptop in the middle of the firmware update to remedy aforementioned bug I was very unhappy with my early experience.  It turned out to be a great computer after the bugs were ironed out, but I'd still rather avoid repeating the experience.<p>Is there any innovation expected in the MacBook Pro line that will be that much of a leapfrog over the current incarnations?  I'm wanting to buy a new development laptop in the next two months as well and I can't see anything other than a better form factor coming out of the next generation.",1335016740

Slicing and dicing the problem into a bunch of tiny sub-problems that can be implemented in short sprints is based on the assumption that:<p><pre><code>  1. None (or few) of the problems are very big.\n\n  2. All of the problems can be solved without much brain strain.\n\n  3. A fairly straightforward well-known architecture can be used.\n</code></pre>\nThose assumptions are clearly optimized for projects like business applications, Web front-ends, enterprise services, etc.  Situations where nothing depends on somebody getting their brain really deep inside a problem and then marinating on and being frustrated by it until eventually a bolt of inspiration knocks them over while they're washing their hair, causing them to hit their head on the washcloth rack on the way down, so that the idea tragically disappears down the drain along with the mingling blood and. .  .<p>ANYWAY.

3871739,comment,3871629,3871629,2,0,dasil003,,,"> <i>We've made it much more complicated than it needs to be. It's a lot like physics or chess (both set-theoretic constructs where simple rules can give rise to high complexity, just like code): sure, it's hard, but that's not the same as complicated.</i><p>I'm on board with the movements sucking part, but the ""more complicated"" argument is a strawman.  Chess and physics are completely different from software engineering.  Chess is different because the goal is strictly defined.  Physics is different because it's attempting to describe a set of timeless, immutable and readily observable truths about the physical universe.<p>The problem with software engineering is that experimentation is very difficult.  You can come up with all kinds of theories, but they are impossible to test in any kind of objective or reproducible fashion.  Plus, even if you come up with something that seems universally true, it's not universally applicable.  For instance, we know that NASA's dev process produces fewer bugs than other processes, but at a cost that's several orders of magnitude higher than typical business software development.  In practice you care about concrete ROI and tradeoffs, so you might be interested in knowing whether unit testing or very strict static typing (eg. Haskell) is more reliable at preventing bugs.  But even if you had unlimited time and resources to analyze all possibilities, I think you'd find it's heavily dependent on the type of software you're writing, and the types and applications of software are not stable or categorizable.<p>In short, software is not more complex, it's just less constrained.  Software engineering is more like mathematics than chess, and more like economics than physics.",1335016155

3871736,comment,3871463,3871618,10,0,matwood,,,"Stack ranking comes out of a couple ideas.  One is that it's important to always be bringing on new people with a fresh perspective.  If no one is leaving the company it's hard to do that effectively, although normal attrition can usually take care of this.  Two, it's management admitting that they have hired the wrong people at some point and have dead weight.  Of course management never wants to say they screwed up, but if every hire was a perfect hire then there were be little reason to try and remove people.<p>The problem is that stack ranking on an individual level puts the employee focus on themselves instead of the team and the company.  All employees should be focused on doing what's best for the company as a whole and not what's best for themselves.  Stack ranking sets up the exact opposite situation.<p>If there are poor employees on the team then speak with them, put them on corrective action, etc...  If you already have a team of great performers, ranking them will only work to align their goals differently from the company and that can lead to all sorts of problems.",1335016067

It also helps compact the text somewhat (that of course isn't as much of an issue on a web page, but readability is still important).<p>Since the page in question have relatively short paragraphs splitting them up two columns is quite nice in my eyes. Imagine if there were no columns, that'd mean that the paragraphs was about twice as wide as tall - not that pleasant to read and it wouldn't look as nice. A lot of pages have columns (for menus etc.) on the left and/or right so they have a natural limit on the width for the main text (which is good), this site doesn't and is why the columns are preferable (IMO). If the window is very narrow the site falls back to one column, neat.<p>Renders fine for me in Windows on Chrome and Firefox but if there are issues for others that's of course bad and can be quite frustrating.",1335016026

Is it still the tool of choice, or are the changes towards Mac App Store making it less friendly towards development? Is the extra money worth the value for a serious developer? I'm leaning towards a MBP with 15"" matte screen with SSD, but I've heard aftermarket SSDs can be better quality than what Apple provides, but I hear they were Kingston drives in the 2011 MBPs, and Kingston's not terrible, is it? I know Crucial and OCZ make decent ones, too, and Tom's hardware said previously that Intel were the best.<p>I'm ok using Linux too, but I'd rather spend more time developing and less time messing with driver issues and a crappier user experience like I tend to in Linux. Although, I recently put Lubuntu on a x100e and love it as a fast and modern lightweight OS, though the package manager isn't the easiest to use, but it is much less buggy than the Unity one with the screenshots and icons.<p>Windows imo is usually not well supported enough for development tools and languages, unless you're using it for .Net/MS development.

Getting a 10% year-end bonus instead of 20% is not exactly ""getting screwed"".<p>The only large (200+) private-sector company where I've worked is Google, where their stack-ranking/Perf system had some serious problems.<p>The first was a 5% cut-line. If you were in the bottom 5% of the Perf stack, you ended up on a PIP. Who usually ends up here? Some were objective underperformers, who'd been coasting for years, in some cases running at less than 1 CL per month. Most, on the other hand, were junior people on underperforming teams-- and of course, those junior people had the least to do with that team's underperformance, but they were poorly established so they got the shaft. That's how most layoffs actually work: junior people who landed on the least effective teams. It's not atypical, but it's dysfunctional.<p>By the way, PIPs have nothing to do with ""improving performance"". They exist to make it easy to fire people without severance. I actually think PIPs are imbecilic, because I'd rather cut a 3-month severance check and separate cleanly than keep a fired employee in the office for 1 month, but that's another rant. PIPs make the finance department happy (look at what we saved on severance payments!) but piss all over morale and make the manager's life hell, to say nothing about what they do for the PIP'd employee.<p>At Google, a PIP is effectively permanent. Even if you pass the PIP, you become damaged goods and can't transfer. It sticks around on your permanent record until you leave.<p>Which brings discussion to the second problem with Google's system. It sticks around forever.<p>When these types of systems get rotten is when they start getting in the way of peoples' transfers. It means that the people who really should be moving to other projects can't get on to them because no one wants to take a chance on that guy who was an ""objective underperformer"" in Q4 2005.<p>So, to come around to your point, I agree that if the rankings are <i>only</i> used to adjust pay, there's not much harm done. Unfortunately, it's rare that data collected is only used for the stated purpose.

3871674,comment,3871463,3871623,18,0,michaelochurch,,,"Well, I don't think hierarchy is <i>prima facie</i> evil. Conceptual hierarchy is how people think. The problem with human organizations (and ""managers"" and the bad rap they get) is that hierarchies are easy to corrupt by aiming at the top, and that they usually promote the wrong people-- social climbers instead of leaders.<p>Managers get a bad rap, but good managers (possibly 10-20%) are worth their weight in gold. Bad managers are disastrous. No managers is rarely an option. ""Flat"" organizations tend to devolve into young-wolf conflicts and evolve their own unofficial hierarchies. In fact, young wolves are more dangerous than managers; because young wolves' positions of influence are unofficial and therefore unsafe, those around them are direct competitors and they have more incentive to attack. Managers rarely sabotage their own reports, because they have the safety of being a level or two higher. Young wolves frequently do this to people who are technically same-level but haven't been around as long or had as much of an opportunity to establish themselves, but whom they perceive as long-term threats. If nothing else, you need good managers in place to prevent young-wolf conflicts.<p>The problem with traditional management, though, is that people promotions are pull-based (i.e. people get promoted by conning the top guys) rather than push-driven from below. The result is that people get promoted based on social climbing rather than real leadership, and managerial incompetence sets in very quickly.<p>I'd get rid of ""performance"" reviews. The word is loaded, and most workplace conflicts have nothing to do with performance. I've worked in elite companies, so this observation may be unusual, but I've seen maybe 20 people get fired in my career, and only one was for performance. The others were personality conflicts or other reasons. Dressing these issues up as ""performance"" issues just makes everyone angry.<p>Instead of reviewing ""performance"", which is code for ""dressing up how I like you as something more objective"", there should be a review along two axes: Skill and Impact, which are much more objective. I came up with a half-decent (IMO) scale for assessing software engineering skill here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> . The difference between 1.5 and 1.6 may be hard to assess, but that between a 1.5 and 1.8 is pretty much objectively visible.<p>Here's the kicker: these numbers are <i>public</i>. It shouldn't be ""sensitive"". Management ought to have the balls to say, ""we think this person has Skill 1.7 and Impact 1.8 and here's why."" What is kept private are reviews more than 12 months old, so that peoples' trends aren't visible for everyone to see. The other thing that deserves to be private (because it is somewhat sensitive) is assessment of a person's potential, but that's not what formal reviews are for. That should be handled informally, in any case.<p>Ok, now as for how the reviews occur... as I said, the problem with traditional management is that selection occurs on a ""pull"" rather than ""push"" basis. So instead of people having ""managers"", they choose sponsors who are typically more senior (although at the very top levels where ""more senior"" is hard to find, peers will do). Sponsors keep track of their reports' growth and advocate for them during the review process. The difference is that a sponsor relationship can be terminated at any time, by either side, without requiring anyone to exit the company, and that an employee can (and should) have 2-3 sponsors.<p>This system allows people to ""vote with their feet"". If someone's not a good sponsor, people move away from him.<p>What happens if someone has no sponsor? If you have no sponsor, you go before upper management yourself during review time. You advocate for yourself. If you can effectively communicate what you have done and what you will do, then you may advance. If you can't, you'll stagnate. (The purpose of the sponsor is to be an intermediate advocate with a better understanding of what the company and its management value, but there's no reason a person can't be allowed to advocate for himself.) Of course, if someone <i>can't</i> get a sponsor for a period of months, that's a sign that this person might need to leave.",1335013619

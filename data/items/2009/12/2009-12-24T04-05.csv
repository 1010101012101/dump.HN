What matters is if you are going to have the authority that goes with the responsibility that your are being asked to take on. If the expectation is that you will keep  a patched together system on the air it matters a lot whether you are expected to replace it and manage the transition to a new infrastructure with grace and aplomb; or if you're being asked to be the janitor in a lunatic asylum where all the devs have root on the production machines and you'll only find out about changes when the system breaks...<p>The first is a professional challenge, the latter is a path to madness.",1261629282

1013394,comment,1013155,1013320,0,0,gvb,,,"Executive summary: Both are very good.  Mercurial tends to be playing ""catch up"" to git in the more elaborate (but very useful) functionality.  Git on Windows tends to be rougher but it is catching up, maybe caught up.  If you cannot decide, flip a coin and Just Do It[tm], it will be a win either way.<p>When I last used Mercurial heavily (around a year ago), its branching was weak so the user model tended to be clone to create a new repo as a branch rather than branching within a repo.  Logically, this is the same, but practically it is less convenient... it tends to create multiple directory pollution and then you forget what is in which directory (especially when you have CRS disease).  I understand Mercurial branching is catching up or caught up with git.<p>Mercurial is pure Python (sorta), which makes it more portable (sorta) but slower (sorta).  Git is written in C, which makes it faster (almost always), but assumes a ""reasonable"" POSIXish OS environment, making it hard to port to Windows (solved now).<p>TortoiseHg is great on Windows.  I have played a little with TortoiseGit - it appears to be as good as TortoiseHg on Windows, but that is a recent development.<p>Git has some killer features, starting with its near magical merging.  As Linus points out, branching is easy - it is the merging that is difficult.  Hg is on par with merging, so that isn't a big discriminator.<p>A unique feature of git is the ""index"" staging mechanism.  This is <i>very</i> handy to pick out certain changes (with the ""interactive"" mode, even down to the line-in-a-file level) and check just those changes into your repository without having to either update everything as a lump or jump hoops to separate wanted and unwanted changes.<p>Another really nice feature is git's ""interactive"" mode which allows major patch rework/rearrangement - you can split, merge (squash), and reorder patches.  This allows you to be anal-retentive on checking in your changes <i>frequently</i> and then rationalizing the forest of changes before pushing it upstream.  (From what I've read, while it looks like you are ""changing"" history, in the bowels of the git metadata, all the state and sequence information is preserved.)<p>Git's rebase is very nice and very useful if used with discretion.  Again, it looks like Hg has a rebase plugin now.<p>Personally, I prefer git because it is the repository for the open source projects I'm involved in and because my perception is that it is more popular and growing faster.  If your development is in the Python world, you probably will prefer Hg for the same reasons. ;-)<p>The really good news is that you can move from SVN to Hg or git easily and you can move between Hg and git bidirectionally with only the conversion time as a penalty without losing any information.  This means that, even if you pick the ""wrong"" DVCS, you can ""recover"" easily.",1261629028

Furthermore, it seems that there is an inverse relationship between how ""advanced"" an organism is in the phylogenic tree and its ability to regenerate--especially to regenerate nervous tissues.<p>One of the major cutoffs seems to be between mammals and other vertebrates. Frogs and amphibians can regrow their nerves if they are cut or damaged [1] and fish can completely regrow their cochlear hair cells, regaining hearing in a mere matter of weeks following deafening from exposure to very loud sounds [2].<p>The ""reason"" for the loss of regeneration in mammals could have something to do with the fact that mammals are more able to undergo plastic changes to their existing neurons (learning new skills, for example) at the putative cost of being less able to regenerate new cells. Ultimately, being able to learn and exhibit complex behaviors may be much more evolutionarily advantageous than being able to regenerate damaged nerves.<p>1. There is actually a clever experiment you can do using this knowledge. You transect the frog optic nerve and rotate the orb of the eye upside-down. Then you ask the question: will it reconnect as before, with each axon in the nerve fiber reconnecting to its now rotated mate and the frog consequently now seeing the world upside-down -or- will each axon reconnect to the closest axon (which would have originally been the incorrect one resulting in the frog still seeing the world the right way up? The answer is that the frog acts as if its vision is inverted, providing evidence for chemical signals being used to guide nerve regrowth. As an aside to this aside, note that people and most mammals can adapt to prism glasses (glasses that invert their vision) in a matter of hours. Amphibians, however, will never learn to use prism glasses no matter how long you let them practice.<p>2. There is work underway to identify which genes are responsible for allowing fish to regenerate their hearing with the ultimate hope of being able to transiently ""turn on"" the human gene homologues.",1261628459

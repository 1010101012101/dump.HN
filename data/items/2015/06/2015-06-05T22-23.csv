Due to the nature of my career I have never had to stop learning new concepts and skill and the pace of this learning has been pretty constant over the last 25 years.<p>What I can say is that up until my late 20s this learning did not seem to come at the expense of past learning or memories. Since then I have noticed that while I can still learn new things at around the same pace as in the past, that new learning seems to kick out the old.<p>Since my ability to learn has not changed (I have had to do courses and other external tests that confirm this personal observation), then the most parsimonious explanation is that new learning is coming at the expense of old learning which is just another way of saying my brain is full :)<p>Of course it is possible that my memory storage capacity is just getting smaller with age, but if this was the case I would expect it to impact on my ability to learn new things now. My perception is my brain can hold around 30 years worth of learning and as you get old that capacity gets stretched to the point that gaps start to appear. While better than the alternative, getting old is not good :(",1433545077

9668711,comment,9668302,9668662,0,0,mdcox,,,"I totally agree (except for the new-grad conspiracy.) I use Go whenever I need to do something small that requires a simple server or API interaction.  Especially if it requires alot of concurrency.  It&#x27;s still a joy to use when I need to get something churned out quickly. The biggest thing it gave me though, was something new but accessible that wasn&#x27;t Ruby, Python or JS.<p>It made me think about pointers, and gave me insight to just how complicated strings and growable arrays are under the hood  instead of just being givens like in Ruby.  It simplified concurrency and parallelization enough that I was able to dive in and learn the concepts which I was then able to use to dig deeper with other languages that don&#x27;t have the nice channels/select built in.<p>I&#x27;ve come to realize that, in my learning at least, there are thresholds of information that people get stuck at, but once they cross you get a flood of improvement.  Go allowed me to stop thinking only within the code context, but also in the machine context.  Now a large amount of my side projects are in C or Rust, and even my day job writing higher level languages has benefited greatly from the new ability to understand the moving parts.  It&#x27;s not going to give you a compsci education, but it&#x27;ll give you that intermediate step you need to wade into that territory.",1433545040

One day I get a call from a broker for his client. I immediately let him know that I will give him 6% commission for the deal.  And of course he was very motivated then  to convince his client to take the property because if he found him another property it not only is work for him  (that was listed by another broker) he would only get 2.5 or 3%. And another owner (if there were any) might give him a hard time about paying commission.<p>By the way this type of thing isn&#x27;t learned in Wharton (where I went btw.).

The language is not designed to be exploratory and is really hard to write off-the-cuff even when you know it cold. It inherits from .NET in ways that make it actively difficult to type on a REPL (as that&#x27;s all a shell <i>is</i>). I like .NET, but the BCL is not the right tool for the job and none of the tooling built around PowerShell can compensate for just not being easily written out when I&#x27;m exploring a problem by hand. I know PowerShell probably better than most people who use it every day--I&#x27;m not an expert but I&#x27;ve studied it at length and used it on the regular for nontrivial tasks--and I can&#x27;t <i>think</i> in it on the fly. It&#x27;s a worse solution to a solved problem, for my money, and I&#x27;m fairly convinced it was <i>designed</i> to be an RPC layer for GUI apps rather than a way for a skilled and knowledgeable user to interface one&#x27;s brain with the metal with as little trouble as possible. And that&#x27;s fine, but that&#x27;s worse with regards to the things that I care about.<p>As for substitutability: this should be obvious. I can&#x27;t substitute it because it isn&#x27;t interoperable with literally everything else in the stack. It is Microsoft for Microsoft&#x27;s sake and incompatible with the rest of the non-Microsoft universe in ways that, it must be noted, Apple <i>did not do</i>; while they have proprietary tools in their environments I can still use it with the bog-standard tools that exist on every other Unix machine I ever touch.",1433543896

I have even had people tell me that they will pay me more if I can get them a better deal. I tell them that they don&#x27;t have to do that. That I charge a fixed fee. [1] (And the fixed fee varies btw.)  The truth is I get them a good deal because (as I mentioned in my other comment) this is a game for me that is fun and that is the reason that I do this. The money that I make is secondary (one reason is it&#x27;s not my primary source of income).<p>In one case I already had a buyer and a seller agree to a deal. The buyer (my client) agreed to the price that I had negotiated and was very very happy. However when talking to the seller I sensed weakness. So I exploited that and got them a better deal than they had already agreed to. Just for the fun of it and because I could. Just to hear the pleasure in my client&#x27;s voice. Was worth a great deal to me. Didn&#x27;t make 1 penny more.<p>So my point is although I think in general (and a book that I can&#x27;t remember the name of talked about this concept with regards to realtors) you are right there are almost certainly realtors who act the same way that I do in other words they do act in the client&#x27;s best interest because it is a game for them like it is for me. I guess the key is finding that type of realtor.<p>[1] Some people who do what I do charge a fee based on &quot;how much they save someone over their budget&quot;.

Not really for me and people I know. You can still make calorie stuffing enjoyable. Even if I&#x27;m alone I can whip up a 10 minute meal that tastes damn nice compared to what Soylent is supposed to taste like. E.g. heat a wok with a bit of oil, dump in a package of pre sliced wok vegetables and a handful of cashew nuts. While that is going soak some noodles. After a couple of minutes add soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger syrup and the noodles, and you are done. With some practice you can make this in 5 minutes. I don&#x27;t understand why somebody would rather save 3 minutes (roughly 1/500 of a day) and drink Soylent. Can&#x27;t you sleep 3 minutes less instead?<p>I&#x27;ve always thought of food like sex. It keeps you healthy, but that&#x27;s not why we do it. Optimizing food (or sex) to minimize the time spent while ignoring the enjoyment completely misses the point for me, so that&#x27;s why I find it interesting and incomprehensible that Soylent is so successful.",1433543166

Here is the theory.<p>If I own something, and you act to deprive me of my rights, then you are a thief and I am allowed to take certain kinds of action to assert my rights.  But if I take action and you dispute that I have those rights, then you are allowed to take action of your own up to and including invoking the legal process.  What kinds of action are allowed is a matter of local law.  For instance threatening bodily harm is not allowed, but taking control of key systems is.<p>In this case, the act of selling 51% of the company that you run means that you have agreed that the buyer can make decisions under specified conditions, even though you created it and may still be running it.  That agreement is why you were paid a (hopefully large) sum of money.<p>By contrast if you sell 49% of the company, you have agreed to many things, but not that.<p>There are many cases where sales might come with complex conditions about when someone has veto power over certain decisions.  That is why a legal review would have been needed in this case to verify that they were OK to proceed.

JIT might even be the best place to work on if you want to make your polished JS engine faster.<p>As far as security goes, goto Lars&#x27; reply.<p>> Integer overﬂow/underﬂow.<p>We now do exactly what was suggested in the paper. Rust enables overflow checking in debug, and we run our CI in debug anyway (release mode build integration is half baked now and I need to work on that)<p>A concrete example would be a loop that just goes on incrementing something. `for _ in 0..n {ctr++}`. This would be zipped to ctr+=n in release mode (optimizations and no bounds checking), but in debug mode there would be bounds checking making it harder to optimize. Additionally in the real world analogue of this toy example, there would be other slowness in debug, and we wouldn&#x27;t hit the overflow condition.<p>Here&#x27;s a case where a Rust API has issues, but only when bounds checks are off: <a href=""https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rc-is-unsafe-mostly-on-32-bit-targets-due-to-overflow/2120"" rel=""nofollow"">https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rc-is-unsafe-mostly-on-32-...</a><p>> Unsafe code correctness<p>So, Rust being Rust the situation is vastly better than C++ or similar. But we still have tons of unsafe bindings and also unsafe being used for perf. Last rust upgrade we had an unsafe transmute of a refcell that broke stuff and caused a confusing segfault in some code far away.<p>Proving correctness is hard, though. C++ is riddled with undefined behavior, and `unsafe` shares a lot of that UB, <i>plus</i> more UB due to assumptions that rustc makes. When you write `unsafe`, writing code as if you&#x27;re in the wonderful world of C++ won&#x27;t work. There are assumptions like &quot;&T will never be mutated&quot; which rustc will make, which should hold even in unsafe code, and if you do something to break that, you cause UB.<p>On top of that Rust hasn&#x27;t been properly formalized yet. So this is something that&#x27;s still far off for us. However, a limited form of correctness checking sounds doable-- but I don&#x27;t have much knowledge of formal checking to be sure of this.<p>Of course, a limited form of unsafe correctness as proposed in the paper",1433543101

9668544,comment,9666812,9667561,0,0,larrys,,,"Oh wow I could write a book in response to that type of question.<p>&quot;if you were the seller in that transaction, is the opportunity cost of waiting a bigger worry than getting the best price?&quot;<p>If I understand what you are asking about the downside risk of not taking an offer on the table? That is always a consideration in any transaction where you are selling whether it be real estate or another asset. And it depends on a multitude of factors.<p>Well first let me tell you that in any situation like this you are in a sense playing the person that is working for you many times (the broker). They have to be convinced by you not told by you. They have to believe what you are telling them in order to do the job for you. And they are playing you as well. You are an actor playing a role. It is a game. This is the game that I play (I don&#x27;t play any other game by the way and I have never played a single video game either but I like this game..)<p>So you have to decide what your position is and them somehow convince them of that so that they act in your best interest. This means being neither to honest or to dishonest.<p>Each situation is different and it is really hard to generalize. In one case I was negotiating a lease and I told the broker &quot;I will take $x per sf however if you can get me $x * 1.1 per sf you have really done a good job!&quot; (arbitrary figures btw). All the while I knew he would be able to get me the 1.1x and maybe more. (And he did..) I had already figured that out in advance of saying that. So I was playing him so he would feel like &quot;Daddy is happy&quot;. (We can call that the &quot;please Daddy&quot; routine). In other cases I might have said &quot;I need $x * 1.2 at the minimum, see what you can do for me&quot;.<p>In another case I find out that a broker had gotten me a good deal by making my offer on  a property &quot;as is&quot;. I never told him that of course. But that is how he got me such a good deal. Most people would have scolded the realtor and gotten pissed off. I didn&#x27;t. In fact I was willing to even waive that mistake on his part (if you want to call it that). When I found out, I wrote him an email and made a joke and said &quot;wow funny I didn&#x27;t know I was buying that &quot;as is&quot;!!! He writes back and says &quot;that is what I needed to get him to accept your lowball offer!&quot; (was about 32% off asking price..). Then he tells me he can take the repairs out of his commission (I didn&#x27;t even have to ask). Of course I could easily back out of the deal if I wanted. But I was actually willing to even pay for the repairs that I hadn&#x27;t agreed to. Not because I got such a good deal but because I want him to take risk for me and not feel like I am some little old lady that will take him out to the woodshed if he fucks up. In other words I want him to feel as if in the end he can take chances if he needs to. This works because that way I get an out and he takes the risks. If he had asked me upfront &quot;I will need to make the offer &#x27;as is&#x27;&quot; I&#x27;d have to agree to that and then I couldn&#x27;t back out as easily!.<p>Here is a real life situation re: quick sale vs. wait.<p>I had a commercial rental property. It was vacant (for about 5 months let&#x27;s say). One day there is a flood in the complex and another owner calls and wants to know if I can &quot;help him out&quot; (was a Physician). Almost like he thought I would let him use it for free? Anyway I tell him that his insurance company will pay for everything and I will deal with the insurance company. The insurance company tells me that the Dr&#x27;s unit should be repaired in 4 or 5 months so what will it cost to rent it for the 4 or 5 months?  I say &quot;can&#x27;t do that I need at least a year&#x27;s rent for the 4 or 5 months&quot; (and why). We go back and forth and in the end I get the insurance company to agree to pay me for a year rent (full ask) for 4 or 5 months. That&#x27;s full ask rent. But in the end I didn&#x27;t even rent to them. I was worried about tying up the property for those 4 or 5 months because a realtor was telling me he had other interest in the property from people who would take long leases. So I had a choice to make door number 1 or door number two. How do you know the right thing to do? You don&#x27;t. You use all of the info that you have and your experience and you make a decision. Sure bet, 1 year rent for 5 months occupancy or door number two longer lease. MAYBE MAYBE NOT. Of course having 7 months to find a new tenant seems like a good idea also, right? I decided to go for door number two. And I did find a tenant and they now have a 2 year lease with options up to 8 years and also an option to buy the unit. And they have renovated the unit at their expense. [1]<p>Does this mean I am right? Well in this case I was right. I took a chance when the safer bet might have been to take the 1 year lease where occupancy was only for 5 months. This type of thing happens frequently it&#x27;s never like the case studies and so on.<p>[1] And in the true spirit another thing happened on this deal. I find out that I am not only paying my realtor a commission but also paying 1/2 of that to the realtor that brought the deal to him. Did I freak out? No, who cares so I paid an extra 3%. The guy who got the 3% convinced his client to go for the full ask rent so he deserves to make 3% and not 6% on this deal. (Rent % is sliding scale on years so these are not exact numbers just making it easy for the purpose of a comment..) And I cut the check right away for the commission so he got it the same week.",1433542648

Not when we were young, but when it was thought we were old enough to appreciate it. Talk about a trigger warning. It&#x27;s literally a graphic portrayal of one of the most terrible things people have done, but we watched it because it&#x27;s important to be challenged and grow. I worry that&#x27;s no longer the case. I really really hope I&#x27;m just being a typical &quot;old person&quot; and that I&#x27;m wrong.<p>The other area where I fundamentally disagree with the concept of microagression and trigger warnings is that there is a popular concept that people have the right to feel a certain way. They don&#x27;t. Some people suffer from &quot;Lepidopterophobia&quot;, fear of butterflies. Their feelings are 100% real and in fact, should you be around someone suffering from Lepidopterophobia try and be considerate. However as a society we should make no attempt to remove discussion of butterflies from public places or classrooms. People suffering from Lepidopterophobia have no inherent right to keep the rest of us from enjoying butterflies. Under the ADA it might make sense to provide them with reasonable accommodations if a psychiatrist has determined they are suffering from Lepidopterophobia but that&#x27;s about it.<p>I&#x27;d implore people to try and keep some of these ideas separate in their head. There are people suffering from PTSD and I&#x27;m sure there are situations that trigger their PTSD (4th of July explosions, dimly lit jogging pathways, men) and cause them to feel some terrible mental anguish. Society is under no obligation to remove those triggers from their life.<p>I keep saying that society is obliged to do this and not obliged to do that. I should clarify what I base this reasoning off of. When society decides to keep people safe by outlawing their murder they are saying that a certain behavior is basically never ok because it&#x27;s intrinsically harmful. Second hand smoke is intrinsically harmful. Peanuts are not, though for many people they are quite harmful.<p>When somebody avoids a certain topic that makes people feel bad there&#x27;s no end to that slippery slope. If we decide that one person&#x27;s internal state is sufficient reason to censor people then there is literally no such thing as free speech anymore. That&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m not willing to pay for one person&#x27;s comfort.",1433542144

Finally decided if I&#x27;m going to keep doing this as a career I&#x27;d better figure out how to use the new tools.<p>Have a new Cent7 install on a laptop at home.<p>I spent over an hour trying to get the wifi to simply connect to the network.  Much of this was me trying to learn how to use the networkmanager syntax which is neigh-on-impossible to decipher. The help is useless, and apparently the syntax made a huge change from 0.9 to 1.0, and not knowing <i>either</i> means that 90% of the hits I found on Google were utterly and completely wrong and used deprecated flags.<p>I finally broke down and tried to use nmtui to solve my nmcli woes, but it only made things worse.<p>The installer was nice enough to create an ifcfg-<myssid>, but when I try to ifup that interface, the system complains there is no DEVICE for it. So I added a DEVICE= line corresponding to my wireless adapter (which nmcli sees), but then the system complains that my wireless device (WHICH NMCLI SEES!) <i>does not exist</i>.<p>I believe I have traced the problem to a bug report I found on RedHat&#x27;s bug tracker --  I needed NetworkManager-Wireless installed in order for it to use my wireless adapter. Why lspci sees my adapter, the OS names it, the firmware is installed and up to date, and nmcli even <i>sees</i> the adapter as a wifi adapter, but then can&#x27;t use it, is beyond me.  nmcli wireless scans constantly failed (which is what led me to the bug report).. the bug report says it&#x27;s fixed and provides better guidance that you need NetworkManager-Wireless installed as of <some version> but that&#x27;s probably wrong, since I have the latest Cent7.1 (unless the bug report is REALLY recent).<p>Regardless, after adding the EPEL repo and installing the wireless-utils package which provides the iwlist, I was able to scan for wireless networks.<p>NetworkManager still was unable to scan, so I did a network restart hoping I could solve the issue without rebooting the whole box.  Sadly, I lost my <i>wired</i> connection to the system at that point, so I&#x27;ll have to wait until I get home to play with it some more.<p>Oh, and by the way -- even though my wired i/f is set to &quot;ONBOOT=true&quot;, it did not, in fact, come up on boot because the cable was disconnected.  After I connected the cable it took me 5+ mins to realize I had to <i>restart</i> the network service to get the connection to function, which is not the way it works pre-NetworkManager.<p>Suffice it to say, the software is massively, massively, massively, massively sub-par, and far less user-friendly than the good &#x27;ol &quot;editing text files&quot; way.  I suspect I am soon to have many more similar headaches as I delve into the world of systemd head first (another thing I&#x27;ve been avoiding).<p>Fortunately, we get to do really exciting things now that NetworkManager has taken over.  I can CD to things, and set properties and methods, and all kinds of shit that makes me feel like I&#x27;m using Fujitsu&#x27;s deplorable ALOM:<p>nmcli> goto ipv4<p>nmcli ipv4> describe<p>Available properties: method, dns, dns-search, addresses, routes, ignore-auto-routes, ignore-auto-dns, dhcp-client-id, dhcp-send-hostname, dhcp-hostname, never-default, may-fail<p>Property name? method<p>nmcli ipv4> set method auto<p>nmcli> back<p>see how fun and intuitive it is?",1433542033

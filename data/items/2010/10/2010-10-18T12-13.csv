Person B doesn't seem important at all at this moment, and seems like the relationship is partly based on friendship. Was this a friend you let into your business just because you think you need a cofounder? Person C seems of utmost importance in comparison to Person B, but still seems like she's not required at the moment. I made the same mistake once when I was younger, but luckily everything got thrashed and I started again by myself involving other people only when it was really necessary.<p>tl;dr: Only add cofounders when you're sure your really need them, and only then assess the risk and their involvement as a measure for equity.",1287406799

1803265,comment,1802961,1802961,0,0,ohyes,,,"'I of course started rambling about how nice it is for concurrent applications, that you can make a map statement run in multiple threads by simply changing “map” to “pmap”.'[sic apparent typos]<p>While this is sort of true, that is not true concurrency, it is parallelism. It seems that a lot of production Clojure code will end up relying on Java code at a low level. (That was at least my experience in getting things performant).<p>When you do this, it seems to me that you lose some of the safe parallelism guarantees. Immutable data structures with 'pmap' are great, as long as you didn't use a mutable Java array somewhere... (This is reasonable, you have enough rope to hang yourself). The takeaway is not 'instant concurrency', it simply isn't true. The takeaway 'great built in support for certain types of concurrency' would be better.<p>I think the 'fourth' point, Lisp is great at syntax abstraction, has always been true, and is a great point to make in favor of any lisp. If you know what you are doing, it is possible to write some extremely pretty, declarative code. (But again, there's no accounting for taste, and you have enough rope to hang yourself).<p>Lisp: enough rope to hang yourself, or write awesome code. Or (more likely) do both.",1287406751

1803263,comment,1802826,1803176,0,0,gjm11,,,"It's completely the wrong question, anyway, for two reasons.<p>1. If some flights have security procedures and some don't, obviously all malefactors will be attacking the ones that don't. So they'll be more dangerous than if no flights had security procedures.<p>2. No one is really suggesting having no security procedures at all, so far as I know. The question is how much security overhead we're prepared to put up with, and how much benefit in safety we're actually getting.<p>I might be reluctant to get on flight A. But if the great majority of flights had simpler quicker security procedures only -- say, 1/4 of the way from flight A to flight B -- then I bet I'd be about as safe on them as I am now with all flights being like flight B.<p>Back of envelope calculation. Suppose I value my life at $10M, and my time at $50/hour. Then I should be prepared to put up with an hour's timewasting if it saves a 1/200,000 chance of death. The actual rate of violent death for aeroplane passengers over the last half-century or so has never been higher than about 1/5,000,000 per flight (in the 1940s and 1960s; it's been much lower since then even counting 2001-09-11; even if you include non-passengers, who of course made up most of the 9-11 deaths, the figure is <i>still</i> lower for the 2000s than for the 1940s and 1960s), meaning that I should be willing to put up with about 2 minutes of security overhead per flight. In practice, reducing the amount of security checking would probably increase the danger somewhat, so the correct figure is probably more than 2 minutes. I doubt it's more than 15.",1287406744

(Positive reinforcement and all that...)<p>Due to all the single word domains being long-gone I looked at two word combinations that were still available and--exactly how is lost to the mists of time--ended up with: rancidbacon.com<p>I decided that it would serve my purposes in the short term but figured eventually I'd have to get a more ""professional"" domain for supporting my freelance contracting career.<p>One thing lead to another, I got some contracting gigs from various places and then got involved in Google Maps hacking which lead to the first amusing domain reference.<p>I got invited to the O'Reilly Where 2.0 conference and got referenced in telephone press conference for the event:<p>""He runs the rancidbacon web site, where all of this was first documented,""
 <<a href=""http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/39/transcript.html&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/39/transcript.html&#...</a>;<p>On meeting fellow map hackers on the trip to the conference the first question I got asked after introducing myself was ""Hey, what's the story behind your domain name?"".<p>As a result of that hacking I got more contract development work (and an email from Google but that's a story for another time) and I started to think ""Hmmm, maybe I won't have to move to a 'more professional' domain name after all...""<p>In the end I kept the name because in the circles I moved in, it had good ""brand recognition"" and I figured the name itself acted as a filter for people who could work with my more laid back style (although I must admit I hadn't considered the cultural issue before now...).<p>The second amusing story happened a few years later when I ended up being interviewed on a nationwide publicly funded radio show because I was the user of a local startup. Before I went on air the producer said ""Hey, look we'd prefer if you didn't mention your domain name on air because some of our listeners might not appreciate it.""<p>Then as soon as I got on air the host introduced me as being from ""rancidbacon"" and once she was wrapping up the interview finished with ""So, what does rancidbacon mean?"". In response, I got to spend a minute of nationwide radio telling the story behind the domain. And a recording of the host saying ""You're the Rancid Bacon guy!"" on air. :) (Although she also said she hoped the name wouldn't come back to haunt me if I ever turned vegan.)<p>Plus, it gives random people on the internet something to do if time machines ever get invented: ""If they ever invent a time machine, I'm going to go back to 1995 and say that sentence to somebody: 'In this case, the enabler is ...

Most algorithms are conceptually simple (once you understand them), but to make them efficient on the sort of scale Google does is sometimes hard.<p>That said, I don't think tagging for them would be very simple like you say. For a start they're dealing with multiple languages, probably many languages without any human annotated training corpora. Even for the languages with training data, web pages are difficult to tag & parse because they often contain very 'slack' grammar and domain specific/slang words. The standard English training corpus is the Penn Treebank (Wall Street Journal text), can you imagine trying to read and understand youtube comments if all you'd ever read was the WSJ? Even tagging search queries would be difficult because they're not even sentence fragments you could use viterbi with, they're often just words strung together without any grammar construct at all so you can't rely on the tag order you know from your corpus to help you tag a query.<p>So I'm very impressed that they're doing any tagging at all, on the scale they're doing it at, and with presumably decent enough results for it to be useful.",1287405966

1803217,comment,1802961,1802961,0,0,jrockway,,,"Clojure is fine, but just to play devil's advocate:<p><i>First of all, the repl is a killer. This is not something that is unique to clojure, but that doesnt make it less good. Beeing able to try out new api’s and fumble forward is great.</i><p>You can do this with Java and every other language.  There's even a C++ REPL floating around out there.  The real difference between Clojure (and CL, and Haskell) is that there is a REPL culture -- library designers use a REPL, so using one to play with their library feels natural.  Trying using a C++ or Java REPL and you'll find that... it's not so nice.<p><i>Second, there is no compile time. It is not that the compile time is short, it doesnt [sic] exist.</i><p>Not correct.  Fast compile time is always nice, and it's great that you don't notice.  But this statement is simply not technically correct.<p><i>Third, functions without state and side effects are alot [sic] easier to test then [sic] java code. Yes you can still create hard to test code, but it is harder.</i><p>But of course, nothing in Java forces you to use state and side effects.  It's a culture problem, again; but if you use Java libraries from within Clojure, you are going to run into those same culture problems.<p><i>Fourth, you can abstract away more code.</i><p>This is true.  Java is missing something like Perl's ""roles"" that allow you to have code in interfaces.   Imagine an ""Equal"" interface that defines equals and not equals.  In Perl, you can provide a default implementation for not equals in terms of equals in Equals.  In Java, well, I hope you like cut-n-paste or messy delegation.  (I have never seen a Java programmer do this, but here's the pattern.  Create a NotEquals class that has one parameter, a class that does the Equals interface.  Implement not equals by delegating to equals in the object that was passed in.  Now you have a class that can do equals and not equals; so create an instance and delegate YourClass.not_equals to NotEquals.not_equals.  Now you can get not_equals without cut-n-paste.  This is too hard for most people to figure out, it seems.)<p>With a higher-level syntax, you can add Roles later, or automate the delegation, so you can pick which design to use based on which one makes the most sense, instead of which one means you have less boilerplate to cut-n-paste.  And that's the joy of high-level languages; you can write good code without wearing out your fingers.",1287405852

I try write some more detailed post about the process but here are few pointers:<p>* We've been talking about this kind of project portfolio / dashboard app for our company quite a while.<p>* I worked on the concept and the first sketches to my notebook like week before while attending some rather boring keynote presentation. Took photos with my iPhone and send it to the team.<p>* We had couple of 30min planning sessions on Tue and Fri where we scoped app and what features it should have.<p>* On Friday afternoon I sketched couple of iterations of the views to paper, so everyone would know what to expect. Also I had the style of the design pretty imagined in my head (I wanted it dark and fancy, and definitely there's inspiration from Cultured Code). Like previously linked, if you like to know I work, I gave a lecture on the subject last week: <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/karrisaarinen/just-design-it-an-approach-to-web-app-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/karrisaarinen/just-design-it-an-ap...</a>)<p>* On Saturday I started about 8 hours late(since I didn't want to wake up too early :-) and I had Photoshop comps of all the main views ready after 7 hours(including couple of iterations each). Key to this was to reuse elements and use layer styles as much as possible<p>* Before and right after that we started implementing the UI. We choose JQuery, 960.gs, Haml, SASS and Pictos icon-font the frontend. I tried to do as much I could with css so I could reuse it, and SASS was really helpful because you could define and include complex styles elements with a oneliner.<p>* The app backend was mostly ready Saturday evening as we planned, so when others left on 11pm, I stayed for other 3 hours and implemented the dashboard and some other views.<p>* We used most the Sunday to polishing the views and the app, and I designed and implement the frontpage on the afternoon.<p>* On like 10-11pm while other guys where fiddling with the deployment I made a iOS icon and some other small tweaks.<p>* Sunday 11pm the first deployment went through, we had some problems with Pictos, Firefox and emails but those were solved pretty quickly.<p>* Then We opened the champange bottle <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8355/deployed.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8355/deployed.jpg</a> and it's was done which was really good feeling.

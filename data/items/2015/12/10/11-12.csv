Regulations usually take the form of, &quot;X is now illegal. If you do X, you will be punished with Y.&quot; It&#x27;s pretty uninteresting if you ask me. People then avoid doing X because they don&#x27;t want to be punished by Y.<p>Say a new regulation is passed that says dumping waste in the local river is illegal. Governments don&#x27;t then station officials watching every corner of the river <i>preventing</i> waste from being dumped. People can still dump if they want. But if they&#x27;re caught, they now face a potentially severe penalty.<p>There is very little difference from how regulations fundamentally operate than how other laws function. &quot;Don&#x27;t do X. If you do, we&#x27;ll do Y to you.&quot; Pretty simple. The same kind of thing is prescribed by libertarians too. The only real difference is that libertarians would like to do it without coercion. (Since most libertarians view the State as the biggest perpetrator of coercion, they understandably want to reduce or eliminate it.) None of this implies that regulations like &quot;don&#x27;t dump waste in the river&quot; can&#x27;t exist if the State were reduced or eliminated.<p>> My criticisms would apply equally to those as well.<p>I gave you an example in my initial comment that demonstrates how your criticism is far more broadly applicable than just libertarianism.",1449748270

PHP/MySQL (obviously), Symfony, composer, npm, grunt, bower, ant, vagrant, docker. And well, language dependencies not needed by the website itself, just for the buildtools: python, nodejs, ruby, java plus virtualbox for vagrant!<p>All of this for a setup that can be (with proper documentation) replicated by hand and from scratch in <10 minutes (Debian, not RPM-based crap). The fuck are you smoking, people? Took me even WITH documentation about all those build tools 30min to get running where a simple git clone should be all that&#x27;s needed.

Let&#x27;s look at 2 examples, the LGBT community and Feminism.<p>LGBT celebrates its differences. It welcomes everyone. It is open minded and tolerant.<p>Feminism bullies, ridicules, excludes, creates us/them divides and is continually hypocritical.<p>You could not have 2 more different different approaches.  You don&#x27;t need to be a bully. You don&#x27;t need to threaten or ridicule or divide.<p>A few (repeated examples) to highlight my point.  Matt Taylor bullied by large numbers of feminists for wearing a shirt designed by a woman, showing women wearing bikinis.  Do women wear bikinis? Yes. Yet, he was mercilessly attacked by at least 10,000 radicals.<p>Domestic violence. It&#x27;s repeatedly reported as a man thing (note: someone close to me was stabbed by his wife while she was high on drugs - but it wasn&#x27;t domestic violence.. As the media says, that&#x27;s only a man thing).  Also note the absence of mental abuse that goes almost ignored.<p>Code.org who didn&#x27;t bother to put a link to encourage boys, but explicitly put one to encourage girls on their main page. This was no accident - they have a quota to meet, apparently at any cost. Mind you, this could equally be attributed to political correctness.<p>I greatly respect how the LGBT community has embraced most people to support their cause without alienating anyone or demanding ridiculous quotas. I am totally gay friendly. Yet, I strongly oppose feminism. I believe in equality, but not equality for one gender or skin colour or sexual orientation.<p>I respect movements that embrace differences rather than reject them.

The principal reasons they left were that the Australian market doesn&#x27;t have the ability to price a tech IPO of their size and to increase attractiveness to foreign investors.[1][2]<p>Atlassian&#x27;s approach to taxation is an exemplar of one of their core company values:  &quot;Be the change you seek&quot;.  They voluntarily paid millions of dollars to their employees to reimburse them for the tax that <i>their employees</i> were obliged to pay <i>on their employee share options</i> under Australian law.<p>Until very recently, Australian law required that employees who receive share options pay tax on the value of the shares at the time the share options are issued (before the options are even exercised by the employee).  The application of the law to startups was widely criticised (including by Scott Farquhar) for obvious reasons.<p>Here&#x27;s Scott Farquhar&#x27;s description of how they chose to deal with that:<p>&quot;Atlassian believes that share options are so important to attracting and retaining talent that it has covered the cost of the tax for its employees, said Farquhar.

And to lose money, to offer better prices, to get bigger market share is not something even remotely immoral.<p>Now, about compilers: Intel have never pretended that Intel compiler is supposed to work just as good with Intel as with other compiler manufacturers. It says so even in the marketing benchmark picture provided with the post. It was individual developer&#x27;s decision: whether he wanted to get equal performance on different platforms, or whether he preferred to sacrifice performance on AMD in order to get more on Intel. Microsoft, Borland, gcc, LLVM and other compilers exist; if a developer choses Intel compiler instead, it&#x27;s his decision to make his software to run slower on AMD. How is offering such an option immoral?<p>However, author completely glosses over the fact that AMD reverse-engineered Intel&#x27;s product and released it&#x27;s clone. To me, this actually seems like something not only immoral, but quite possibly, illegal, and definitely something worse than Intel&#x27;s deeds.

Typically, you are &quot;tax resident&quot; if you spend more than 180 days per year in a country. (Note: that doesn&#x27;t mean that if you split your time equally between three countries you avoid being tax resident at all. If only avoiding tax was that easy...)<p>The company employing you _might_ be willing to help with the necessary headaches of abiding by the employment law of the country you are in. But they would more than likely prefer that you are self-employed/freelance/autonomous in the country you are in. Abiding by the employment law and tax law in your country of resident becomes your problem.<p>How exactly that works for your social benefits depends on the country in which you are tax resident. For example, here in Spain, a freelancer (&quot;autónomo&quot;) is not automatically entitled to state unemployment benefits (&quot;paro&quot;) if the work ends. But you are entitled to maternity leave and retirement pension. You&#x27;d need to talk to an accountant in your country to understand exactly how exactly being a freelancer affects your social welfare rights and responsibilities.<p>There certainly are some tax advantages to being a freelancer: eg. being a freelancer in Spain entitles you to claim a VAT refund on any business-related expense. That new computer you want to buy? Expect that in a year or so the tax department will refund you roughly 17% of the total purchase price (21/121 of the retail price).",1449745720

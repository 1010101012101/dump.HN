More so than I had assumed reading a lot of the reporting.<p><a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/microsoft-apple-and-google-where-does-the-money-come-from/4469"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/microsoft-apple-and-google-wh...</a><p><i>>AAPL is one bad iPhone away from getting beaten by Samsung.</i><p>Look at how much of Apple&#x27;s revenue is just iOS. Crazy. I&#x27;m not sure that Samsung is the threat, as they are just a hardware vendor like Apple, but without the profitable app and digital goods store (I&#x27;m assuming that App Store revenue is falling under iPhone/iPad in chart but could be wrong). I also see Apple more willing to change the business it is in if it needs to than some of its competitors. Apple got a lot of flack for the Maps &quot;debacle,&quot; but it was a bold and decisive move. Apple couldn&#x27;t come to terms with Google so they just built their own global mapping service. With so many eggs in one basket though, the revenue is certainly Apple&#x27;s to lose or keep, depending on how it executes.<p>The Google chart is just amazing. Everybody knows why Android is free, but this just hits it home. They&#x27;re an advertising company plain and simple. Anybody, anywhere,  that can build better storefronts (search, email, native apps, etc) is a threat.",1377269955

If the group is large enough, its movement will closely mirror the market, so for a large enough group of equities (chosen randomly) about half will have correlation below 1, and half above.<p>It merely means that Microsoft is reasonably closely tied to the market&#x27;s movement, though slightly below.<p>You compared it against its sector, technology. The tech sector has a higher average beta than the utilites sector. That&#x27;s just the nature of the sector.<p>Where it gets interesting is something like FB at 3.29. That&#x27;s really high.

It&#x27;s not about hopping languages based on the latest bandwagon, it&#x27;s about people wanting to share their experiences with their new tools.<p>What&#x27;s more, just because many of us have got a little exited about Go / node.js / whatever, it doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;re turning our back entirely on older technologies (case in point: I&#x27;ve recently made the switch to Go; both for web development and standalone console apps. However I still use shell scripts if I want to bang out some quick sysadmin routines. And I still use Perl CGI if I just need a very quick page thrown together for internal / personal use).<p>I think it&#x27;s great to embrace new technologies, but not at the expense of abandoning older technologies when they&#x27;re a better fit. And I think most people on here are intelligent enough to realise that. So the diversity of languages you see published on HN are the equivalent of the variety of different IDE&#x27;s or even OS&#x27;s around - they&#x27;re not always there to replace each other as they often set out to solve different goals; and nobody is advocating that members of this community should learn and hop to each new language like a <i>Frogger</i> sprite leaps from log to log.

In reality, Microsoft is in a very safe position, only facing competition in markets they never had a strong hold on to begin with.  In the markets Microsoft is really dominant in they are in almost no danger.  Let&#x27;s put it this way:  top business-user reasons for virtualization on GNU/Linux are <i>running Windows Server to run Exchange</i> and <i>running Windows to run stock market software</i>.  Try taking Office away from the big business customers who bring major income to Microsoft.<p>The comparison to railroads is apt.  Railroads are still immensely important, even if people no longer romanticize them.  Innovations in railroad technology are still very important.  The financial difficulties railroads faced in the middle of the 20th century had more to do with the government promoting automobiles than with the superiority of cars and trucks.  If Microsoft is the technology world&#x27;s&#x27; equivalent of a railroad they are in a pretty good position -- they might not be the company everyone is talking about but they will be the company that everyone is dependent on.",1377269785

The author of this blog post is either outright lying about it doing drive-by-installers and malware or is clueless about what the terminology actually means.<p>The last time this was posted on HN, I did a quick writeup on my understanding of it (reposted here):<p>&quot;For the curious, this is an optional program at SourceForge being offered to developers as a way to monetize their work. The developer needs to specifically request it. SourceForge gets a cut, so does the developer. The installer is their first stab at this process and is using the bundling technology from Ask.com. As offer-based installers go, this one is about as good as it gets. It makes a single offer and has an Accept and Decline button with the user selecting whichever one they want (not a pre-checked box accepting the offer above a Next/Continue button). If accepted, the installer installs the offered software and it gets a standard entry in Windows&#x27; Add/Remove Programs that works as expected. If declined, the installer continues. The installer then downloads the originally-requested software.<p>The two issues with the current installer are that (1) it is served in place of the requested file with no indication that a substitution is made as the user downloads and (2) it requests admin rights before it starts downloading the software, which can be a security issue. Roberto (who posted the article) has stated that they are working on #1 in terms of the text shown on SourceForge as you select to download and download. As for #2, there may be some ways to rework the installer so this is not an issue. I&#x27;ll mention it to him when I speak to him.<p>SourceForge has one other revenue-share program with developers where you place the SourceForge-branded download buttons on your own website that link to your downloads on SourceForge and you get a small cut of the ad revenue made from the download page.<p>If I recall correctly, SourceForge has been losing money for a few years now. Dice Holdings picked up SourceForge and Slashdot while Geek.com kept ThinkGeek.com, so they are now separate entities. These new experiments are attempts to get SourceForge to be self-sustaining/profitable. Ad revenue alone likely won&#x27;t cut it.<p>Unfortunately, Google Code, Github and others don&#x27;t offer the full breadth of services that SourceForge does for open source projects. Google Code, Github, and others have all ditched binary downloads, so SourceForge is one of the only providers to make binary downloads available to Windows and Mac user at no charge. This is why SourceForge is popular for real apps (FileZilla, Pidgin, PortableApps.com, etc) and Github is popular for components (node.js, jquery, rails, etc). The code zips available at other providers are of no use to end users.<p>As full disclosure, I run PortableApps.com, one of SourceForge&#x27;s largest projects pushing quite a few TBs of downloads through their mirror network. We make use of the SF-branded download buttons revenue share program but do not make use of nor have any plans to use the &quot;enhanced&quot; installers. Everything I&#x27;ve discussed here is already publicly available, I just thought it would be handy to have in one place.&quot;<p>After that post, it was pointed out to me that Github has added in the ability to host binaries, but I would wager they wouldn&#x27;t take kindly to the kind of bandwidth that the major SF projects like PortableApps.com push through.  I&#x27;ve also been in touch with Roberto who made the mentioned post on SourceForge about some suggestions and options including doing an open source installer that the end-user/sysadmin can verify before installing instead of it being a downloader installer with the offer built in but not the app you want.",1377269393

The same logic applies; hesitation results in death. Blind confidence is a necessary trait to make such quick decisions, to not hesitate, and to not second guess yourself.

6263873,comment,6262574,6262574,33,0,SeanLuke,,,"I want to hijack this discussion to bring up a personal gripe I have about this all being called &quot;leadership&quot;.  It is a very PHB term.<p>With the exception of a few outlying examples, no job being discussed in this article is a leader.  A leader has <i>followers</i>, and he can convince them to follow him through his sheer force of will and inspirational ability.  Examples of leaders: Barack Obama, Mahatma Gandhi, Charles Manson, Jaime Escalante, Joseph Smith, Napoleon, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Mao Zedong.<p>The people and job titles being discussed here are not leaders.  They are managers.  The difference is that people don&#x27;t do what a manager says because he has inspired them to do so.  People do what he says because they are paid to do so.  That is, managers don&#x27;t have followers. They have underlings.<p>Managers are of course needed.  To work in groups effectively, a roughly fixed-arity hierarchy has many advantages, and in a hierarchy someone has to be a non-leaf node.  The goal of a manager is to manage his underlings in such a way as to meet or optimize certain organizational goals.  In general this is a very different set of skills than those found in the best leaders.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that certain leadership skills aren&#x27;t helpful for management: obviously it&#x27;s helpful if a manager can apply some powers of persuasion to his immediate underlings.  But leadership skills are not necessary to management: there are plenty of reasonable managers with few or no apparent persuasive skills whatsoever (I&#x27;ll be kind and not name names).<p>Persuasion is also not restricted to management: it&#x27;s helpful in practically any job involving human relationships.  This includes teachers, salespeople, hostage negotiators, lawyers, and magicians.<p>But few other career paths imagine themselves as &quot;leaders&quot;.  Teachers don&#x27;t go to leadership seminars or buy ridiculous low-rigor books on leadership.  This seems to be a cult special to the management community.  Why do so many managers imagine themselves to be something they are not?  I think it&#x27;s for two reasons.  First, they have power, and leaders have power, and so they have mistaken one for the other.  Second, and more importantly, I think management is an awful and thankless life choice.  Managers don&#x27;t make anything or really contribute anything tangible to society.  The Dilbert Principle is very valid here.  And so managers try to imagine that their jobs (&quot;leadership!&quot;) are more important than they really are, simply out of ego boosting.<p>I think that leadership is so valuable a skill, and so rare and powerful a force, that we should actively fight to prevent the management community from co-opting the term to describe the daily task of collating TPS reports.",1377268971

Is a discussion that can be a little misleading, so be wary and don&#x27;t blindly trust some random guy on a forum.<p>In the video they relate this randomness to the fact that qubits live in a superposition of states, in contrast to bits, which can be either 1 or 0, but not both. This means that when you measure a qubit, you would still obtain 1 OR 0, but you will obtain each with certain probability. So, how is this different to just picking a random bit and then measuring it? You could fabricate a way of picking those classical bit that yield the same distribution than the qubit.<p>We find a difference in one of the very first experiments that highlighted the quantum nature of the microscopic world; the double slit experiment: you have two screens, one with 2 small holes and the other is placed behind that. Then you send a bunch of classical particles through the punctured screen and you receive the counts on the screen behind it. Then you have a distribution of places where those particles hit. Then you do the same with quantum particles this time. You obtain a different pattern (this is important, is different to the classical pattern). This pattern is called &quot;diffraction&quot; pattern and means there was a wave like interaction between the particles. So now you try to do the same experiment with quantum particles, but sending them one by one, so no classical-like interaction could exist. Amazingly, you find the same diffraction pattern. This means one particle can &quot;interact&quot; with itself. The way physicists explain this is by allowing quantum states to exists on this superposition states which induces intrinsic randomness due to the fact that when measured, each particle could only have travelled through one of the slits, or each qubit (after measurement) can only be 1 OR 0, but not both.<p>This difference between classical and quantum description of nature goes deeper, and makes mechanisms as entanglement and teleportation possible. &quot;Bell inequalities&quot; are a great example of of some other, related ways in which both differ.",1377268876

You can buy boats that already have moorings, otherwise you have to get on a 5-year waiting list. Actually buying the mooring on its own doesn&#x27;t seem easy. Usually its either buy-the-boat-and-mooring or get on the waiting list.<p>But even with a mooring, you still pay rent for it.<p>Here&#x27;s some example numbers:\nSaw a lovely boat moored in residential moorings near Kings Place (really central london). Price was £90,000, which is a lot but when you compare it to flats in the same area it becomes attractive.<p>But ... the monthly mooring charge would still be around £600 a month, which is like paying rent anyway. Actual boat-on-its-own was valued around £50,000 which means you&#x27;re paying an extra £40,000 for the mooring and then have to keep paying £600 a month to keep the mooring. A bit like paying a mortgage, but without any capital gain. If you give up the mooring, you&#x27;re boat is instantly worth 40k less. Also bear in mind that its hard to get mortgages to buy boats.<p>I know a chap who&#x27;s got a boat without mooring and its a lot of fun but yes he does have to keep moving it.<p>edit: for fun, foxtons search of houseboats for sale in London\n<a href=""http://www.foxtons.co.uk/search?search_type=SS&openhouse=&oh_date_from=&oh_date_to=&stoppress=&sp_max_days=&submit_type=search&search_form=map&prop_type=boats&bedrooms=&bedrooms_max=&price_from=&price_to=&location_ids=290&new_homes_id=&sold=1&dev_op=&result_view=&per_page=10&order_by=price_asc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foxtons.co.uk/search?search_type=SS&openhouse=&oh...</a><p>tldr: boats and stuff.",1377266991

This is one of our major problems. I use the anti - Darwinian metaphor. The survival of the unfittest.<p>If you remember if you were in college the fraternity president was always there for you. When you had nothing to do or when you were a little depressed. Feeling down. You go to the club and the fraternity president would always be there. You wondered when he had time to study which he probably didn’t do very much of in school. He was there to sympathize with you if your girlfriend didn’t show up or didn’t call you back and you obviously sort of liked the guy because the fraternity president was usually a likeable guy.<p>When the elections came up you would always vote for him. He had a couple qualities - the fraternity president. Politically, he was a survivor and he never made many waves. He did not promote controversy. Therefore when he went out into corporate America he was able to move up the ladder fairly quickly. Remember he survived, he didn’t make waves, and he wasn’t a threat. He kept moving up and up.<p>Eventually he becomes the assistant to the CEO. The CEO had the same qualities. He’s a survivor. He’d never employ anyone underneath him who might be a threat. The boards like these guys… this type of CEO. The boards generally don’t own any stock (another problem with our system). The boards don’t really care to hold CEOs accountable. Remember it’s a symbiotic relationship. These guys pay the boards very well – they give the boards perks. The boards don’t care to hold them accountable because that might endanger the perks they love so much.<p>When the CEO retires the assistant becomes the CEO. And remember what I told you. He’s a survivor. He would never have anyone underneath him as his assistant that’s brighter than he is because that might constitute a threat. So therefore, with many exceptions, we have CEOs becoming dumber and dumber and dumber. We can all see where this is going. It would almost be funny if it wasn’t such a threat to our ability to compete and to our economy in general.&quot;",1377266880

9313988,comment,9313056,9313165,0,0,eliben,,,"yapf starts making tons of sense after you&#x27;ve used similar tools in other languages. The chief two examples are &quot;go fmt&quot; and clang-format. The former goes without saying - formatting is enforced in Go.<p>The latter is widely used to format C, C++ (and even JS and Java) code. Many projects these days require all code to be clang-format&#x27;ed and even enforce it in commit hooks and such.<p>After working on such projects for a while, you get so used to the convenience of an auto-formatting tool, that you want it in <i>all</i> languages you code in. It&#x27;s extremely useful to be able to just type a bunch of code quickly into the editor, copy-pasting, renaming, and know that the tool will nicely format it for you. Another advantage is that the whole code in a projects starts being and looking very consistent, which is important. Holy wars about brace placement and indentation just disappear.<p>So yapf is essentially that, for Python.",1428022069

9313983,comment,9313182,9313958,0,0,pcwalton,,,"One nice—and, I think, underappreciated—thing about Servo layout is that the parallelism forces you to organize your algorithms cleanly. Unlike every other engine, render objects in Servo are not responsible for laying out their children recursively; the higher-level parallel traversal driver does that. That means that you must write your layout code in such a way that the right information is available at the time the traversal invokes your layout method. You are also limited in what you can access: your render object can&#x27;t access your parent (because that would be racy), nor can it access the DOM (because we can run layout off the main thread). This requires a fair bit of up-front thought, but once that&#x27;s finished it&#x27;s easy to read the resulting code, because the layout code is grouped into specific functions (&quot;assign-inline-sizes&quot;, &quot;assign-block-sizes&quot;, and so forth) that do just one thing. This goes a long way toward making layout easier to understand, especially when it comes to complex situations like tables.",1428021890

All it&#x27;s going to take is to really get it working on 90% of websites and then I think it&#x27;ll be a clear contender for replacing Gecko in a lot of places.

I knew was completely in the clear - I hadn&#x27;t ever heard of this person or seen their creation before. After dismissing some typo-riddled communication I though was bluffing I found myself named in a lawsuit. Turns out that knowing I was right was a whole world away from proving it in court. I was told it would cost me tens of thousands to defend myself. And the best possible outcome was for me to win my fees back. In the end I paid the other person to go away. The entire process was expensive, time consuming and incredibly stressful. I lost days of sleep worrying about what could happen.<p>My case could have been resolved so much more easily without lawyers. I was actually interesting in monetizing and this person needed eyeballs on their product. I would have gladly sent them traffic if they agreed to an affiliate set up. The problem was that once lawyers start getting involved then the bills start adding up quickly. From then on it was classic sunk cost fallacy. Backing off means paying thousands of dollars for the privilege of being sued. No one wins but the lawyers.<p>Sure, this company is going to be stopping some people from stealing images.

I remember growing up with a couple friends who had Amigas in the late 80s, early 90s. My parents ended up buying a PC for home because of work stuff sometime in 90-91 and it didn&#x27;t hold a candle to the Amigas my friends had.<p>I had to add a Sound Blaster to even get audio (digital sounds were all computed by the CPU so 4ch sound and Amiga quality video almost brought it to its knees) and it really wasn&#x27;t until I upgraded to an SB Pro and a decent graphics card (this was before 3dfx) that I could say audio and visuals were <i>capable</i> of what an Amiga could do out of the box. But then it took forever for the software ecosystem to catch up. There were popular games coming out at that time that were still <i>EGA</i> and quite a few with CGA and Mono graphics.<p>Even then, most of my friends had modded and hacked on the A500s to get them faster processors, more memory etc and they were easily as capable as my PC.<p>I don&#x27;t think it was really until the mid90s where PCs started to comfortably pull ahead in both hardware and software. I remember getting a GUS MAX and maxing out the memory on it, and finally knowing for sure that I had audio that was clearly superior to anything the Amiga could pull off and it really wasn&#x27;t until Doom that you could say that a PC could finally do something an Amiga couldn&#x27;t. By then we were in 1993/1994, 486s were finally becoming consumer level chips, and high-end systems were running 486DX2s or DX4s and clock multipliers were finally putting the final nail in the Amiga&#x27;s coffin.<p>But I was on my 3rd or 4th computer by then and my friend were still on their 5-6 year old A500s (though heavily modded by this point). One of my friends toyed around with getting an A4000, but stories of incompatibilities and other issues scared them away and eventually they just ended up with a PC like everybody else. I think the final nail was when Apple switched from Motorola to PowerPC and it became apparent to everybody that the 680x0 line was a technological dead-end and with it the Amiga.<p>But 5-6 years was an <i>eternity</i> in hardware in those days. If you use Moore&#x27;s law (18 months) as a generational guide, the Amiga was 3 or 4 generations ahead of the rest of the PC market in terms of hardware and software capability. There&#x27;s really nothing like that today that&#x27;s comparable.",1428021456

A shotgun is a point in the general direction and shoot kind of thing. It also has a lot more stopping power than a handgun.<p>Also, with a shotgun, you can use larger gauge bird shot or something like #4 buck shot and it is less likely to penetrate walls and hurt someone you didn&#x27;t intend.<p>A 12 gauge pump shotgun is also an intimidating looking and sounding weapon. Much more so than something like a 9mm handgun. Finally, the laws regarding shotguns for many area of the US are likely to be much less restrictive than on handguns.<p>I understand your comment about the unwieldiness of shotguns, but in my particular case, my shotgun has double pistol grips and no stock. I would be much less concerned about loosing control of it than I would a pistol. I have a top mounted light that triggers when the front pistol grip is grasped. It is (almost) as short as the law allows... the entire weapon is just over 2 feet long (28 inches to be exact). I hope I never have to use it in defense or worse yet, shoot to kill someone. For this reason I have 5 shells in the chamber. The first two are birdshot... deadly at close range, less likely to be so at a further range. Then I have two rounds of #4 buck, then a slug. I have 5 more rounds of #4 buck in holders at the top. I&#x27;ve considered having the first two rounds rubber like the police use.",1428020025

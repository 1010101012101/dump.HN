It turned out that the average subscription lasted 2 to 3 months, and <i>nobody</i> kept a subscription longer than 5 months.

Such habitats could hold millions of people.<p>McKendree[2] later speculated on what might be achievable with mature carbon-based nanotechnology, expanding the possible size to 460kms diameter and 4600kms long -- almost as much surface area than Russia -- and in any basic climate configuration desired.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Frontier:_Human_Colonies_in_Space"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Frontier:_Human_Coloni...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKendree_cylinder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKendree_cylinder</a>",1349012001

http://www.businessinsider.com/justfab-raises-76-million-to-create-the-hm-fashion-brand-of-the-web-2012-7<p>It kept me wonder why a company with very questionable (I will try to avoid using the word ""fraudulent"") business model was able to raise big money. Didn't the VCs have to do the due diligence?<p>I didn't have any direct experience with JustFab. The victim was my girlfriend. Back in January or so, one of her friends emailed her a link to JustFab, then she bought a pair of shoes from www.justfab.com and never visit the website again. Only 8 months later, in early September she was appalled to find out that her credit card has been charged a $39.95 fee for the last eight months. Yes, $39.95 for 8 months, without geting anything from JustFab.<p>I then did a bit research on the internet. It turned out my girlfriend wasn't the only victim. Apparently JustFab works like this: once you buy something from their website, you become their ""VIP member"". Then you will have to log into their website between the 1st-5th of each month and click Skip This Month. If no action is taken (either skip this month, or cancel your account), they just charge you a $39.95 fee every month.<p>According to the Business insider article, JustFab ""will generate about $100 million this year"" in sales, I wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn't read their entire 2,500 words Terms of Service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing.<p>p.s. After JustFab CSR refused to refund, I decide to post this story again, hoping it will get upvoted to the frontpage of HN so that more people get to know what is really going on behind JustFab<p>pps. Anyone could just simply google ""justfab scam"" to see how many others have been victimized. It's outrageous such large scale scam got unnoticed.",1349010717

I.e. this was a typical abusive political Federal prosecution; Enron in general gave the usual suspects an excuse to wreck horrific damage, including most especially SarBox which was the final nail in the coffin of the VC funded hi-tech startup business model.<p>As for Satyam, at least in US auditors proceed from the assumption that the company it not lying to them and they do some spot checks to verify (e.g. ""You say you have 150 widgets of this type in that warehouse; let's go look at them."" And ""You say you have 29 crores in this account at that bank; call the bank and authorize them to tell us about the account."").  If the company is sufficiently fraudulent, as I recall reading Satyam was, auditor malfeasance is <i>not</i> assumed, you check to see if the auditor's verification procedures were reasonable and if they ignored anything they shouldn't have, but otherwise you can't assume they too were corrupt.<p>Auditing is expensive from both sides, the auditor and the company being audited, where a number of people are tasked with supplying the auditor the information they need and demand (e.g. those verification checks).  If a company is running a sufficiently sophisticated scam, e.g. their official books are very carefully constructed fiction, I don't see how their pushing out regular records would help.  I.e. the way they pull off their scam is to continuously make everything look good, as opposed to trying to put together a false set of books just before the audit, which would likely result in enough errors auditors would have a good chance of catching them.",1349010590

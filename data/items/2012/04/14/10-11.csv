Why would ACL definitions have to live in code (as opposed to, say, a simple Web interface)?<p>I'd think something as simple as a graphical UI to define database schemata with read/create/modify permissions for owner/world on each field would be enough to cover 82% of use cases effectively. Beyond that (e.g. complex group management), I can't think of a secure client-side solution off the top of my head, but I suppose that would be what the Node.js plugin could be used for.<p>Edit: Actually, for a lot of use cases group management could be handled by the client as well. For example, if a group is defined by a table, then the creator/owner is de facto the first member and administrator. If any administrative actions require an admin auth key and adding new members or admins is an administrative action, then there really isn't any way to hack the system.

The internet doesn't have walls or distances. There is no separation between the work office and the dance club. A Google search and our boss knows who are our friends, what are our political opinions, and all things we can keep private in the physical world.

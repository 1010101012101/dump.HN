That seems like a pretty big distinction to me.<p>Edit: And if Bitcoins are like cash, why should I bother using them? I already have cash (that I don't use very often) available to me readily. And since I get paid in dollars, what advantage do I have to use a separate currency solely for rare and unimportant transactions?",1352739576

If that address is not available at link time, the code must be moved to a different address and jumps must be fixed up to compensate. Because of that, in practice, loaded libraries are often not able to be shared between processes in memory. The reason for this decision is that pic code requires an indirect jump through an offset table which adds extra processing overhead. 64bit Windows is implemented closer to Linux style .so files due to the addition of new pointer relative addressing.",1352739102

They care about collaboratively completing a task (maybe) so gear your headlines and copy towards that.<p>- It wasn't clear that the logo leads you to a demo -- I had to read it here that that was the case.<p>- When I hover over the ""enter a task"" field in the demo my cursor turns into a circle with a line through it and I can't click.

When I read code that comes from people who use this style I often find that their functions go on for ~70 LOC, use at least 3 levels of nesting, and are littered with comments to explain what is going on.<p>More often than not I was able to show them that they could break these procedures out into compose-able functions and drop the comments.  With the right data-structures they could avoid excessive loops and conditionals.  And with the right unit tests if they ever needed to change the implementation of a function they would know right away if they broke something.  Suddenly they didn't need so many comments because their functions were < 10 LOC and self-explanatory -- the name of the function gave its meaning and the higher-level code read more like an explanation of the process without all of the details of how the machine should perform it.<p>That, of course, is the best case scenario.

JavaScript much like VB serves the purpose of gluing together apps that are close to the user and doing so rapidly. There is no denying that developing an app on a HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end and a Node.js back end is fast probably one of the fastest stacks to develop in that I have seen in my career. Probably the only thing that was faster was back in the days of CGI/Perl but that is comparing apples to oranges as back in those days interactivity was minimal. It is almost as fast as building a traditional VB desktop app, which is pretty amazing given the infrastructure needed for web apps. There is definitely a place in the mainstream for JavaScript but it does not get all the credit, projects such as Node, Modernizr and Dojo have done just as much work to make JavaScript a rapid development choice as the core language guys have.",1352737237

We independently discovered this hack last weekend. Here's some information:<p>- the client is trusted; the opponent's client does not validate a played word<p>- Game Center is a nave carrier for turn-based games; no validation is done on the server side<p>- Game Center is nave by design; this is the beauty (and one of the drawbacks of GCanother major drawback is that your client only works with GC, which means you can't easily port to other platforms, and if you do port, you can't play cross-platform games because non-iOS devices can't use GC). The real beauty here is that Loren/Atebits doesn't need to run <i>any</i> server infrastructure. Apple does it for him. This is a huge benefit to games like this.<p>- We contacted Loren; he was really cool about it, and doesn't seem to care that Letterpress is cheatable in this way. I'm with him on this. It doesn't matter.<p>- There's no leaderboard, nor even a long-term score in Letterpress. This cheat doesn't matter.<p>- As far as we could figure, there's no way to fully validate both clients without 1) adding a server component, or 2) losing the ability to port Letterpress games between devices (from iPhone to iPad, for example); I'd love to hear ideas about how this could be possible if you think we're mistaken<p>- The dictionary files live in the application's `o/` directory, as a series of text files, named by the word's first two letters. e.g. ""imbecile"" would be in `o/im.txt`<p>- The app will re-read dictionary files on launch (or maybe at word play); either way, the dictionary can be changed <i>during</i> a game; it's even possible to start a game with a person and immediately play the winning 25-letter word, before the opponent even gets a game-state notification from Game Center<p>- There are 271377 words in the Letterpess dictionary.<p>- The longest words in the Letterpress dictionary 21 letters long. There are three of them: `counterdemonstrations`, `hyperaggressivenesses`, and `microminiaturizations`<p>- There are 124 two-letter words<p>We'll try to outline some of the other Game Center research in the article we publish.

I can pick a random classifier with a tunable parameter and draw its ROC curve and then pick the ""optimal"" point, but if the classifier sucks then that's no good. Why would a frequentist classifier based on a hypothesis test be good? A hypothesis test is the answer to the wrong question for the purposes of making a decision.<p>As I showed above, you can indeed get the same result from Bayesian decision making if you use a weird prior and utility function, which shows that frequentist decision making based on hypothesis tests is a subset (of measure 0) of Bayesian decision making. Again, that just means that you encoded a most likely wrong prior and utility in the choice of method without any justification.",1352736249

Amazon isn't exactly making it super convenient, but they're doing very little to prevent it. Stock, of course, they retain the ability to do so but on the other hand A) sponsor the hardware and B) provide updates and very good support.<p>I consider it a pretty fair tradeoff. They're not stopping you from churning your own butter, so to speak, but do count on you deciding it's easier to just run their stock stuff.

4692924,comment,4692376,4692376,2,0,martin-adams,,,"In my opinion, a professional web site is one that may use the following (no particular order):<p>- Good balance of page elements, such as copy over graphics, etc.<p>- Legibility of text (this is the visual spacing of which text can be read, font-size, colour, line height, line length, kerning, etc, etc).<p>- Readability of text (does it make sense when you read it?)<p>- Professionally written copy.  Forgets saying ""We are the leading company in ..."" - yeah you and everyone else.  Tell me why you're better, not that you are better, and why it's important to me, not your ""thousands of other customers"".<p>- A strong value proposition (why am I here and what do I get out of it)<p>- Strong images, such as good photography with people in it (pictures of people do wonders to user engagement).  Also have them looking at the product or where to go next as it guides the user.<p>- Page load speed - I don't want to see the non-essential elements be rendered first all waiting while those adverts and analytics are loaded before I get to do anything useful.<p>- A business identity - professional web sites are run by professional companies who don't mind talking to you over the phone, so show the phone number.<p>- Clear navigation with no confusing terminology that makes me wonder if I'm in the wrong place.<p>- No tacky animations, just non-obtrusive complimentary motions that support my visual comprehension of the action I took, rather than it just trying to look flashy.<p>- If it's a service (such as MailChimp), then don't be shy of what other big brands use your product.  It gives more credibility.<p>- Consistency. Keep navigation, fonts consistent with their purpose.<p>- Be honest. When it comes to pricing, don't hide it and make me call.  Otherwise I think you're up to some shady practice to hound me in to spending more.<p>Okay, that's all I've got time for.",1351087064

Microsoft: ""you can see more, do more and share more with Surface."" Apple: ""The Retina display on iPad makes everything look crisp and lifelike.""<p>It's weird and unnatural, and -- here I may just be being eccentric -- it gives me the feeling that the companies are trying to manipulate me, hoping that if I keep seeing ""Surface"" instead of ""the Surface"" and ""iPad"" instead of ""an iPad"" some bit of my brain will start treating those product names like personal names and feel warm and fuzzy and friendly towards the products.<p>It's weird the way that Anand goes along with this in his article when he's talking about the Microsoft device (""After living with Surface however, I understand the appeal"") but not when he happens to mention the Apple one (""I wouldnt say that it looks better or worse than the iPad, its simply different""). So much so that I almost wonder whether Microsoft made it a condition of providing a review device that the review had to avoid ever saying ""the Surface"" or ""a Surface"".<p>As a measure of how unnatural the locution Microsoft's marketing people are trying to push on us is, notice that almost everyone here on HN, commenting on Anand's review that consistently uses MS's preferred form, none the less says ""a Surface"" or ""the Surface"" when referring to a particular instance rather than to the brand. [EDITED to add: I am not suggesting that he's showing some kind of deliberate favouritism or that MS asked him not to do the article-dropping thing when referring to competitors' products.

I am building a semi-complex Multisite installation with multiple domains. So far, it's been pretty decent.<p>Your frustration with their caching ""secret sauce"" is understandable. However, you can get a rough idea of their caching back-end by poking around in the WP Engine config files and plugins bundled with your installation. They also provide a nice little overview here: <a href=""http://wpengine.com/our-infrastructure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wpengine.com/our-infrastructure/</a>.<p>If you are staging out anything more complex than a single blog, you will definitely want to have two production instances to test on. For some, this is a raw deal. I personally don't mind.<p>I am also not a huge fan of their CDN feature, which works by rewriting URLs in your page source to point files and assets to NetDNA servers. However, I am hopeful that they will improve upon it.<p>That said, I have enjoyed a platform that keeps my Wordpress installations secure with automatic upgrades.<p>Comparing WPEngine to other hosting providers like Linode or Dreamhost is really unfair. They offer completely different services, and specialize in Wordpress-optimized hosting only.<p>I also have to say that it was really nice to not be part of Amazon/Heroku's outage this week.

First the investment needed to built the necessary production capacity, but that is not production cost (production cost are a result of this via hourly rates and costs per piece). The ability to cale from a prototype stage to serial production is crucial here, and yes damn expensive and risky. One wrong step and the company doesn't even have to care about inventories.<p>Inventory kicks in once the company has scaled successfuly. And then iventories are more curial to success than production costs in terms of company survival. Market entry is won with product costs low enough to make a profit. Once in the market you live and die by cash expanses, inventories are huge part of this. Espacially since hardware becomes outdated pretty fast, high levels of exess stock can basically mean death for a young company.<p>But all that is one of the schleps coming with hardware, and bulding such an operation from scratch is a really interesting thing to do.",1351083758

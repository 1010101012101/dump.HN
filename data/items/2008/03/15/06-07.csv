Think of it like this:<p>1) A good idea<p>2) A good idea for searching the internet<p>3) A good idea for searching the internet with a certain algorithm to rank pages.<p>4) Using a distributed computing system to make this search scale.<p>5) Google.<p>As each order of possibility collapses into the next the idea becomes more and more the execution until its done. At each stage, the value increases as some possibilities are trimmed off and the idea becomes more concrete (or less as the wrong ones remain and the path is derailed).<p>The primary problem going on in the IP world right now seems to be an unhealthy focus (and over valuation) on the very early stages of the continuum. Patents should be issued at steps 3 and 4 but they are being issued at 2 instead. Thus selling stuff <i>but on the interwebs</i>, becomes patentable and the dissonance caused by this makes it difficult now for those at 3 and 4 trying to get value from the actual hard part.",1205564342

137417,comment,137358,137358,0,0,whacked_new,,,"The sentiment that ideas are worthless without execution is generally true. This can be easily explained, as ""execution"" can be broken down into two components: actions, and details. Action is obvious: no action, no product. Details, well, are ""where the devil is.""<p>A really good idea will include enough details, that it spills over into ""execution."" It's not just an idea-market. It's an idea-market where people submit via a form that looks like this, click that button, get scored this way. We will launch it by doing this, talking to those people, and focusing on this sector. We will convert this into physical and monetary value by selling this service.<p>Now, that may be an idea that is worth something.<p>While you have described certain approaches, until you have a very sharp focus that describes <i>exactly</i> how to get from point A to B (nothing to full product), which means not just ""one way to do this is..."", but ""this is how we will do it,"" then the idea really is not ""executable.""",1205563181

4529242,comment,4527868,4527868,2,0,DougWebb,,,"For Android, you need to set up the Android development kit, which is the Java language, Eclipse IDE, and some packages from Google. You can get all of this for free from Google. I found it to be a PITA to set up, but I've never liked Eclipse. You can set this up on any hardware/OS.<p>For iOS, you need to download and install xCode from Apple, which means you need a Mac. You'll also have to pay for a development license so you can sign your apps and sell them through the store. You'll be developing in ObjectiveC here, which is kind of an odd language. I also found xCode to be an odd IDE, but if you're used to Macs it might be more intuitive.<p>If you want to develop in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, you can just create a website, or you could do a single-page app design and wrap it up in Phonegap to create a native-ish app that can be sold through the stores. There is a phonegap version for each platform so you still need to set up dev environments for each, just like if you were doing native development. In fact, Phonegap's installation guide on their website is a great introduction to setting up development environments for a bunch of mobile devices, not just Android and iOS.<p>My recommendation is to stick to a regular website, perhaps using jQueryMobile if you want a mobile-specific UI, if your app does not require much offline functionality or hardware apis beyond location. Other hardware apis are being defined and are slowly becoming available to standard Javascript, but they're mostly not ready for prime time yet.<p>If you need offline functionality and/or access to the hardware, but you don't have the resources to do native development on each platform and you don't want to focus on just one, Phonegap is the best choice. Your apps will still feel like a non-native website rather than a native app, but 90% of your effort will be cross-platform so you can save yourself a lot of time.<p>If you have the resources and/or want to focus on a single device platform, go native. You'll get better integration with the platform, better performance, and a lot more capabilities.<p>PS: It <i>is</i> possible to use other dev languages. Android is Linux underneath, and you can write code in any language Linux supports, which is most of them. The drawback is that Google wrote the Android SDK libraries in Java and Java doesn't interoperate with other languages nicely, so you don't have access to the SDK in other languages. This is being addressed by Google, but slowly. I think you can probably use other languages on iOS too, but with the same caveat.",1347807370

4529222,comment,4528379,4528379,15,0,drblast,,,"Personally I've decided that life is absolutely meaningless, and I've found that to be incredibly liberating.  It's helped me to not put so much pressure on myself to achieve (achieve what?) and live more in the present.  It's a shame that people who don't find meaning in their life tend to take the opposite tack toward depression.  Or others gravitate toward followership to anyone who will tell them how to live.  If I could give advice, it would be to not do that.  Half the fun is figuring out what's meaningful for you.<p>Otherwise, there are various clichs.  People will say their family is most important and money is meaningless or some variation.  I think those truisms are worth the amount of time it takes someone to repeat them, which isn't much at all.<p>And I love that scene in Fight Club where Brad Pitt is telling Ed Norton that he won't be truly enlightened until he knows, not just thinks, that he is going to die.  I wouldn't risk your life or hurt yourself to figure this out, but if you're in your 20's and haven't had any near-death experiences, as you get older, you will DEFINITELY realize that your life is finite and it will change your perspective.  There will be a thousand things that in the back of your mind you always have thought you'd have time to do, but then you turn 30 and start to realize that you probably won't.  And that you need to start economizing and prioritizing.",1347806861

I really like his expression of this idea in his essay ""What You'll Wish You'd Known,"" the essay that drew me into reading his essays regularly, which eventually led me here to Hacker News:<p>""If they were just like us, then they had to work very hard to do what they did. And that's one reason we like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy. If these guys were able to do what they did only because of some magic Shakespeareness or Einsteinness, then it's not our fault if we can't do something as good.<p>""I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right.""<p>It seems undeniably true that any teacher of any subject will encounter some students who, as the teacher finds them, seem to ""get"" the subject right away, and other students who struggle to understand even the most basic principles of the subject. But if the teacher gives up on the struggling students, the teacher is just being lazy. Israel M. Gelfand, a mathematician who was a great mathematics teacher, once wrote, ""Students have no shortcomings, they have only peculiarities. The job of a teacher is to turn these peculiarities into advantages.""<p>The submitted article on arstechnica includes near the end a promoted reader comment that is very good:<p>""They were supposed to be learning Java, but there were always at least three students who didn't 'get it.'<p>""My solution was simple; get them as far away from the computer as possible (since programing is not dependent of computers), and have them ""program"" a group of people by giving one instruction at a time to do things like pace a room, or throw a ball. I'd teach them loops and the like by doing this for about fifteen minutes. It was fun and simple.<p>""After that, they'd be ready to Pseudocode, which meant they were ready to use Python. I'd have them write a working version of their homework in Python, THEN I would have them translate it to Java. Java was just too much as a first step (I will never understand the reasoning of teachers who introduce students to programming on anything other than Python). The problem was always that the class needed to be broken into smaller pieces that could be conquered, which in turn encouraged the once failing students. Victory is addictive.""<p>That's what an effective teacher does--change the context of instruction, and draw in students with connections to what they already know. Some students entering a programming class would be ready to move beyond the approach suggested in the comment, and those students should be allowed to plunge right in to actual programming in a high-level language, but so far no one has developed a rigorous demonstration based on careful experiment that students smart enough to be admitted to an undergraduate degree program have some kind of invariant lack of ability to learn programming if at first they don't ""get"" the basic beginning steps in a typical programming class. Try a new approach and see what happens. Don't accept an excuse for being lazy as a teacher.",1347805581

I'm going to assume this evaluates to TRUE for what follows.<p>1) Have your SO read PG's essay on this topic; you know the one.<p>2) If their response is receptive and nurturing, then talk about concrete tactics that will support the long, uninterrupted stretches of time you need to thrive [tactics to follow, below].<p>If they get defensive after reading the essay, then you will know that indulging in maker time when you <i>could</i> otherwise be spending time with them will need to happen A) in a separate, unshared space, and B) during hours and within contexts that the general population of non-makers would consider a socially acceptable time to be practicing your craft--i.e. 9-5, M-F.<p>If (ideally) your SO inquires as to how they can support your maker's schedule while you're cohabitating, then explain to them how the Pomodoro technique works, and on your breaks between Pomodoro's, give them your complete and undivided attention. This way, you're able to focus without stressing about possible interuptions, and your SO enjoys your full, undivided attention during breaks, with the nice side effect of you being in a great mood during these breaks.<p>3) Realize that your SO, and all the other relationships you have with friends and family, are at least as meaningful and valuable as anything you could be making. <i>Share</i> the joy and purpose that making brings to your life with the people who love you--and just as importantly--take pride and great pleasure in the things that matter to them, too!",1347805364

4529178,comment,4527839,4527839,1,0,drostie,,,"A rough idea of why the Fibonaccis and the golden ratio are related: in making a golden rectangle, you take an existing rectangle, attach a compass across its long end, and use that compass to construct a square. You add the square to the golden rectangle to get... another golden rectangle. If you wanted to repeat this, there is also a ""flipping"" of the rectangle by 90 degrees. Mathematically, the process takes a rectangle (a, b) (where b > a) and produces a rectangle (b, b + a). But that's just the Fibonacci recursion relation, so starting from (0, 1) or (1, 1) you'll generate all the Fibonacci rectangles as you 'goldenize' them further and further.<p>An actual proof: Since  and 1   are the solutions to the quadratic x = x + 1, they also solve x = x + x and thereby form a basis for all solutions of the Fibonacci recurrence relation: in other words, you can solve the system of equations {A + B = F ; A  + B (1  ) = F} for parameters A and B, and then the recurrence relation guarantees A  + B (1  ) = F for all remaining Fibonaccis. (For F = 0, F = 1 this gives A = -B = 1/sqrt(5).) Since |1  | < 1, this decays geometrically to 0 and the dominant term is simply F  A .<p>The article thankfully does explain that the golden ratio is the most irrational number: because a continued fraction expansion gives the best rational approximations, large numbers in the continued fraction expansion make for extra-good rational approximations, and the golden ratio has the smallest numbers possible -- they're all 1. What it doesn't quite explain is that if you're growing a spiral by spitting out dots and you turn by an angle 2   each time you spit out a new dot, those spirals often seem to ""line up"" in lines given by the denominators of the best rational approximations. So if you have a rational number like  = 22/7, you would literally see just 7 straight spokes coming out of the center; if you use  =  you will see a region where there seem to be seven spirals due to the fact that 22/7 is a disproportionately good approximation to , off not by ~ 1/14 but rather by ~1/790. Anyway this is the more concrete reason why, if you take a sunflower and count the spirals, you always seem to ""magically"" get Fibonacci numbers; they're denominators in the best rational approximations.<p>You may wish to experiment with a spreadsheet to see all of this dynamically for yourself, a-la <a href=""http://tmp.drostie.org/sunflower.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tmp.drostie.org/sunflower.png</a> .",1347805094

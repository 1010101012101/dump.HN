I believe the advantage of not having to remember email addresses is very useful to many people.<p>It seems Tim Berners Lee's worry about the effect of Facebook towards less open Internet is getting more true than ever. Are there significant actions we can do about this?<p>Large Internet email providers (Google, Yahoo, Hotmail) should come up with something similar like address auto-fill on third-party sites (with appropriate security & privacy implementation). They might even want to team up to counter Facebook's rise--after all, Facebook is now one of their largest competitors on the Net. (I am aware that Microsoft is an investor and partner of Facebook; so Hotmail might be less likely to come on board.)",1303801145

2484232,comment,2481213,2481213,23,0,abalashov,,,"On a related note, though orthogonal note, never assume anything overly logical about the customer's math.  A lot of pricing issues come down to something psychological or presentation-related, rather than objective and quantitative.<p>I long ago noticed--as many consultants know--that there is only so high that hourly rates can go for an individual or a very small company, and it's not really that high.  Beyond that, people start googling their eyes, making incredulous expressions and hyperventilating.  They have a certain metric in their head of how much a glorified typist like yourself should be making, and if you exceed that metric, they start comparing your contract rate to (1) their own salary (which is obviously fallacious, since they are not contractors) or (2) other contract rates they've been exposed to lately, like when they tried to offshore the project they are now trying to get you to rescue after it flamed out spectacularly (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect#Recency_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect#Recency_effect</a>), and (3) the billing rates of their attorneys and accountants.<p>""Obviously,"" in their mind, you can't be charging as much as attorneys and accountants.   You're in a different sociological category from people whose very profession has always been defined by high costs and high-rolling swagger in popular imagination;  you're just some kind of computer guy.  And if you're charging 8x what the folks in Bangladesh quoted for a team of 10, are you really worth it?  And $250/hr?  Good heavens, that's almost 8x the ~$34/hr I make on my $70k salary as the lead IT guy!  Who do you think you are?<p>The point is, once the impressive-sounding hourly rate has grabbed people by their egos, you aren't going to be able to re-center them and capture pricing based on value.  You've lost to the dark side of dick size contests and pissing matches, and as often as not, you're up against some relatively pedestrian actor who is determined to put you in your place, not a key fiduciary stakeholder and/or decision-maker.  There's really no way to recover from that nosedive.<p>So, in practical terms, you can't really get beyond $100-$200/hr rates in the small to medium contract IT and software development services sector without crossing a number of irrational psychological barriers.  Obviously, this doesn't apply to the enterprise segment, and doesn't apply to any company that has successfully fostered the expectation of either elite expertise or high overhead--ideally both.  If you're Accenture or IBM, you definitely don't have to worry about this, but if you're part of a well-known ninja specialist squad, you probably don't either.<p>Notwithstanding outliers, I was very surprised to discover that quoting a flat price has a good way of keeping the customer centered on the value they stand to gain and away from judging your swashbuckling billing.  There are some ostensible reasons for this: it soothes the feelings of customers burned by open-ended enterprise-style darken-the-skies-with-people hourly billing, and demonstratively puts the risk the consultant.  But it also gives them a fairly opaque number to work with instead of sizing up whether you're ""the kind of person that ought to be charging that.""  Most importantly, and most relevantly, it completely disrupts their mathematical circuitry;  it is amazing how many times I've run into customers that get in a tizzy when you quote them ""10 hours at $250/hr"" but happily sign on the dotted line when you tell them it's going to be $2500 flat and be done in two days.  Even weirder, they'll still sign even if you _tell_ them it's ""about 10 hours of implementation time.""  I don't think it's because they can't do division in their head;  I think when the conversation starts out with a fixed-price premise, that computation just gets routed to a different psycho-social/emotional bucket.  This is dissonant to the basic governing intuition of the hacker brain, but that's often how it goes.<p>So, I don't quote projects in hours anymore.  I usually provide some idea of estimated implementation time so they can do the division themselves, being ethically reluctant about a price-support scheme that is reliant solely on opacity of cost basis and/or what the implementation actually involves, but it doesn't seem to matter.  The results are undeniably and resoundingly positive.  Something about human nature... I don't know what it is.<p>All this to say:  If you're feeling shaky on quoting something ""insane"" in hourly terms, quote it as a fixed-price project.  You might be surprised by the disparity in outcomes.",1303800956

2484198,comment,2481806,2482504,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>"" ... a symptom of the unsound economic decisions being made by the authorities in China.""</i><p>I would caution you to be careful about how you define 'soundness'. If China is doing these things, then it would be unsound to apply modelling weights to those events that were similar to the weights you would apply in a free market. Whereas the appropriateness, or inappropriateness, of the actions the Chinese government has taken with respect to its economy can only be evaluated in terms of the goals of the government with respect to its economy.<p>If the goal is full unemployment as a means of satisfying citizens desire to work, spending GDP on works projects can certainly achieve that goal. It would be unsound on the other hand to sit on the capital and allow unrest to foment in the general population. Economics is simply about the allocation of resources, it doesn't really judge those decisions until you have all of the decisions, the goals, and the results.<p>For example, many argued that it was 'unsound' to for the Federal Government to create TARP at the time it was created. However, the US economy has bumped and creaked but it has kept operating which was the goal. So now a couple of years past the decision, and knowing the goal, and evaluating the result, the decisions seem if not sound at least reasonable.<p>Presumably the Chinese have studied the Soviet handling of the economy and won't make the exact same mistakes they did. One notable difference is that the Soviet economy had a tremendous difficulty making competitive products for export on the world market, that does not seem to be the case for China so far.",1303799254

It's based on friendships (Facebook after all) and Facebook credits. So I'm guessing that if suddenly all my friends were going to X on Y and I see that, I can say to myself, ""hmm, I feel like catching up with some friends, all I need to do is go to X on Y too..."".<p>Groupon, you show the link to a friend and they go, ""Yay, cheap food!"" or you can go, ""hey friend! let's get more friends and go hang here!! cheap food!!"" but I'm guessing Facebook will take out all of that ""tedious"" planning stuff, so it's very streamlined - i.e. if more than X friends are going to Y you'll be pestered via your Wall until you click ""buy"" or whatever it'll be.",1303797942

2484162,comment,2483341,2483393,3,0,cookiecaper,,,"The biggest impediment to a Netflix competitor is getting the licensing from the media companies. After that, Netflix is a very bandwidth-intensive service and it would require a significant upfront investment to establish a competitor, which is probably why not many are trying. Even if you just want to do rental only, that still takes a significant investment to provide processing centers and make the required arrangements with the Postal Service. It's definitely not a low overhead venture.<p>There are some people that seem to be posturing to compete with Netflix. Amazon has some video on demand services and an unlimited solution on some titles for Prime subscribers. YouTube has made forays into the rental business and if they were interested in providing a service analogous to Netflix they'd be able to do so, and this may be beneficial to Google if they decide they want to ramp up on Google TV.<p>Furthermore, Microsoft refuses to license its DRM, which is used to encrypt Netflix streams, for use on desktop-grade Linux systems so Netflix can't do anything with the desktop Linux market for the time being. This is a major detraction for custom HTPC builders and some others. YouTube and Amazon both use Flash to deliver their content and both are playable on desktop-grade Linux machines.",1303797829

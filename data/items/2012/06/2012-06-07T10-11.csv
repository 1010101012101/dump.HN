4078320,comment,4073309,4073309,1,0,Gigel,,,"Obviously the list was filtered to eliminate duplicates. It contains only what the hackers wanted it to contain. So, why does nobody mentions that it is HIGHLY LIKELY that the user names associated with the passwords (which are actually mainly e-mail addresses for LinkedIn) are also in the possession of the hackers.
So, if I would be the hacker - strip usernames, strip duplicate hashes, post list of unique hashes to let others do the CPU intensive cracking, retrieve cracked passwords, match with usernames (e-mail address), check same password on other accounts (first on the e-mail account, then google the e-mail address on forums or try on the services that interests me and say ""forgot password, send it again to this e-mail address - thank you telling me that this e-mail has indeed an account with you...""), monetize somehow the data.
As a user that implies - IMMEDIATELY change your password for the e-mail address used to login at LinkedIn (if it was the same password); verify if settings of this e-mail account have changed (like an additional unknown address added to allow retrieval of the password, DUH),
try to remember where you use the same address either as login or to recover credentials, try to remember where you used the same password, google you e-mail address to help you remember; change passwords; consider abandoning the e-mail address if it is not your primary one,... 
Also - did the amount of SPAM that you receive on the e-mail address used to login at LinkedIn suddenly increased, while SPAM remained constant on a similar mail account not connected to LinkedIn ? Maybe someone just sold your e-mail address, so the LinkedIn break may affect you even if the password is not in the list.
Bottom line is - LinkedIn approach appears to be: We have no proof that this particular account was hacked since password hash is not in the list - let's not overreact and let'sassume it is not hacked even if we don't have a clue what was actually hacked. I'm not to judge if it is the best approach for the business, but sure as hell I don't like this approach as a user.",1339065637

I also use Pinboard.<p>Pinboard I use for pointers to things - GitHub projects that might come in handy in the future, development/design resources, particularly interesting Wikipedia articles, and other things like interviews and magazine articles.<p>But there's some stuff that I want to keep. I used to have a `~/box` folder on my Mac where I'd keep pictures, quotes, and screenshots of web pages I really liked. I wanted to keep them locally so that I would always have a copy of them. However, there were problems with this. By just keeping pictures as files, I couldn't always easily find where the picture came from (not without coming up with a complicated naming scheme or moving away from the simplicity of just having files in a folder). I kept quotes in plain text, so attribution was difficult for them, too  I needed to be able to capture quotes quickly, so I didn't have time to also store the URL the quote came from. And screenshots of webpages aren't exactly interactive  if I wanted to look at some HTML to see how something was done on the page, too bad. I also didn't have a pretty way to look at all the things I'd wanted to keep. All I had was a Finder window.<p>I know that Pinboard's premium service can archive each bookmark I send there (I've been thinking about enabling it just so I have permanent copies of interviews), but archiving an entire page is overkill for when I just want to save one image or one choice sentence from the page. Besides, if I archive the whole page, how can I indicate which image/quote I wanted to save in the first place? Long story short, Pinboard's archiving isn't quite what I want (though, like I said, I've been thinking about switching it on for backing up interviews).<p>Gimme Bar is basically the best of all those worlds. I can save images, videos, quotes, and site designs. I can easily see where the image/quote/etc. came from. The site gives me a purdy way of looking at them. And integration with Dropbox means I always have a local copy of everything. Gimme Bar lets me have my cake, eat it, <i>and</i> have my cake stored in Dropbox (I may be stretching this metaphor).<p>Anyway, I really, <i>really</i> like Gimme Bar.",1339065201

1. DO NOT check whether or not your password was compromised via services like leakedin.org. If you've used LinkedIn, it was stolen. They only RELEASED around 6 million passwords, though LinkedIn has 161 million users. Odds are, your password is not found from the publicized list. There's very little reason to assume, that those password-hashes were the only ones out there...<p>Correction: 6.5 million <i>hashes</i>, which most definitely comprise more than 6.5 million users once commonly used passwords are accounted for. Of course, we are both making assumptions, but it is not accurate to say it is only 6.5m users (just yet).",1339064204

I can just create a separate note or notebook to collect all the related ideas in one place, and I can write down my ideas in the most organic form possible.<p>Also, some critiques on the app's features based on what's written above:<p>1. People probably don't want to use an app for organizing ideas that actually SHARES those ideas with other people.<p>2. When I have an idea that's still a little abstract, I think the idea pointing system is kind of useless because obviously I'll have to spend more time thinking about it, but I still have to write it down. I'm just saying, it doesn't always have to be put out in the open for feedback right away.<p>3. Idea validation is, from my experience, better off done via conversation with the people you trust the most. So either I'm saying that automating that process is less useful, OR you can make the app a bit more social by allowing only a user's most trusted friends to evaluate the idea. That way you don't scare away people from your app because of number 1.",1339064003

The root goal is the whole project; it can be broken down into components which are the subgoals; each of those has sub-components, all the way down to the individual lines of code.<p>The fundamental problem is that until you're actually well into the project, you can only see down a few levels; but the amount of effort that is going to be required is a function of the length of the <i>fringe</i> of the tree, which you can't see, at least not very clearly, until you get there.",1327777109

This place is overwhelmingly populated with people for whom the concept of salary negotiation is repellant. One could get a seriously skewed idea of what to expect from negotiations from comments on HN.<p>The fact is, a huge number of places <i>that you'd actually want to work at</i> are going to treat salary negotiation as the business transaction that it is. Not taking the transaction seriously is going to cost you thousands and thousands of dollars.<p>It's true: the worst places to work will be the ones who are most aggressive about negotiation. But that observation <i>totally misses Patrick's point</i>. You don't have to get screwed by a hard-nosed negotiation to lose out on thousands of dollars of comp. In fact, if you don't take negotiation seriously, you'll lose thousands of dollars without even noticing, because your social norms will blind you to what's happening. Patrick isn't just talking about how to handle stupidly tough negotiations. He's talking about <i>all</i> of them, even the nice and friendly ones.<p>The range between your negotiating floor and the employer's negotiating ceiling is the spread. Any dollar figure you accept below their ceiling is a dollar you gave them. From the way people talk about negotiation on HN, my guess is that 9 times out of 10, HN'ers take a number smack in the middle of the spread --- meaning, they've coughed up high 4 digits (and often 5) back to their employer. And they feel good about it! They write blog posts about it!<p>If you think you work on a team where you don't have to negotiate, because everyone's grown-up and knows the score and pays people what they're worth, seriously consider that you may (probably not intentionally, but still) be getting played.",1327776023

Many times, what a company ""saves"" in negotiations is immaterial relative to the hiree's compensation. In exchange, the company immediately begins a relationship with an engineer on a sour note and sends a huge signal about company loyalties and values.<p>I'd recruited an engineer to join my team, and he tells me his comp requirements (90K salary). For the position, we budgeted 96k. A stellar engineer and ideal team fit, I thought he was underpaid at that, but that's what he asked for so I prepared an offer.<p>In preparation, the CEO (who signed off on such things) sets our initial offer to 85K. I was surprised -- why would we not offer the candidate 90k salary? The conversation went something like this:<p><pre><code>  CEO: Offer him 85K.\n  Me: Why? He asked for 90K, and we've budgeted 96K.\n  CEO: I want to leave some room for negotiation.\n  Me: Room?\n  CEO: Yeah. I think we can get him to come down from 90K.\n  Me: You haven't met him yet. Why do you believe he would accept a lower offer?\n  CEO: I never take the first offer at face value.\n  Me: I've talked to him, and he earns 90K in his current position. He doesn't want to\n  take a pay cut.\n  CEO: Well, let's see how much he wants this job.\n</code></pre>\nI make the offer, and the candidate responds ""I don't want to take a pay cut, and can't accept your offer."" The back-and-forth begins, and we finally come to agreement -- at 90K.<p>And while the engineer accepted and joined our team, I could tell that the offer negotiation made him uncomfortable and left a bad taste in his mouth. He did a great job for well over a year, until he left for a new position. He explained to me that he received a better offer, and that the other company was ""more inviting"".<p>After his departure, the CEO lamented how engineers seem to have no loyalty.<p>Indeed.",1327775034

3522749,comment,3521982,3521982,1,0,sirclueless,,,"Try to think about this from an optimizer's standpoint. Here are some excellent reasons why giant memory footprints are a good thing:<p>1) Freeing memory is expensive. In order to do it properly in a running process, you need to check that each piece of memory is not in use, and that typically requires traversing large graphs. It's only something you want to do when absolutely necessary. (Hint: it's not necessary when you have 16 GB of RAM.)<p>2) RAM is really fast. Things in memory can be read in a few CPU clock cycles. On disk, you need to wait for a plate of metal moving at 50 mph to swing by.<p>3) It's totally free! It's not like unused RAM can enter power-saving mode or anything. If your RAM usage isn't at 100% you are wasting valuable space. This isn't a checkout lane where lower usage is a win for everyone. It's like an everlasting candy fountain: it all rots if you leave it, so get the whole neighborhood in for a piece.<p>So honestly, what are you complaining about? So chrome wants to cache hour-old pictures just in case you hit the back button 45 times. What's the big deal? YOU HAVE 6,600,000,000 FREAKIN' BYTES LEFT! You could probably fit Project Gutenberg in there. If and when you run out of memory, and pages take 15 seconds to load because your hard drive is swapping like crazy, then you have a problem. But you won't have that problem. And just because chrome is taking up 3 GB at the moment doesn't mean it won't be a nice citizen when the operating system starts to cry about low memory, which it won't do because YOU HAVE 6 MORE GIGABYTES.",1327774741

It's to make sure that works are registered; as soon as an organization goes out of business or loses track of what it's claiming, it forgets to register it, and it's public domain permanently.<p>Point (2) reveals a flaw, which is that organizations would spring up to do the registration (you'd pay them $100 and they would keep the registration going for 100 years).  That's why the copyright holders' real name and address is required -- so that these intermediaries need to keep track of the claimant.

Tying the fall of for example the Mayan civilization with the triggering of an ice age due to decrease in agricultural activity and associated re-forestation seems like a stretch.",1230825546

They had older units (early 2007 ish) and MS fixed it within a couple weeks - for another friend who had 2 faulty units they just gave him a new elite and apologized for his problems.",1230825524

416437,comment,415606,416377,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Interesting question. I am not a biologist, but I believe I read that cells have a sort of ""internal clock"", modulated by certain enzymes. Normally cells reproduce in a certain way, but these enzymes deplete over time, such that at a certain point the cellular structures don't reproduce in the same manner as before. Hence, ""aging"". So, sure I am all for finding treatments for Alzheimer's and so on, but aging itself, as outlined above, is just really an evolutionary necessity. Stephen King treats this sensitive topic well in his novel, 'Pet Sematary', dealing with both the human resistance to, and the biological necessity of, death, including the aging process leading into that. Personally I find great comfort in the idea that even if however many millions of years from now, all or most mammals, including humans, will be extinct, some of our genes won't be, just as for example birds have some of the genes the dinosaurs had. The individual may be here for only a short time, but the genes she carries are far more transcendent.",1230824687

416432,story,,,36,88,Anon84,"Ask HN: What will you learn this year? ",,"Every year, I pick a topic I want to learn more about. Not just by professional imperatives but mostly by sheer curiosity. 
At one point, it was C++, Japanese, Monte-Carlo, Business, Politics, Economics, etc... This year, it's investing and finance in general and the financial crisis in particular (for obvious reasons).<p>With the new year still wet behind the ears, what have you decided to learn about?",1230824427
416431,comment,416069,416187,0,0,jimbokun,,,"This is what I've been doing.  I've been taking one computer science course per semester, and picking a language to learn to do the problems in.  Well, actually, more like 4 semesters and 3 languages (Common Lisp for 2 semesters, Python and Clojure 1 each).  This is in addition to doing Java as my day job, and trying to learn it better, too.<p>This has occasionally led to more excitement than I wanted, like trying to push Python to do a processing intensive task and then switching to Java at the last minute so it would finish by the deadline.  But for the most part it has worked well and by picking more productive languages to learn has even made some tasks easier than they would have been with my day job language.<p>However, my goal for the new year is to start a blog and write more.  One of the first topics I want to write about is the programming languages I've used and what I've learned from them.",1230824407

416428,comment,416408,416423,0,0,tokenadult,,,"""It's difficult to be correct if your area of expertise is predicting the future.""<p>A very good point. I like the definition of ""expertise"" championed by K. Anders Ericsson, a researcher on expertise and how it develops. He defines expertise as RELIABLY superior performance to a degree that makes the performer a statistical outlier. In one of his studies, he discovered that there is no such thing as expertise in choosing common stocks in which to invest.",1230823712

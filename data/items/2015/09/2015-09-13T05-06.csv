10210490,comment,10209693,10209693,0,0,nether,,,"> Finally, one learns that boredom is a disease of civilization. It seems to me that what boredom mostly is is that people have to keep themselves entertained or occupied, because if they aren&#x27;t, then certain anxieties, frustrations, discontents, and so forth, start coming to the surface, and it makes them uncomfortable.  Boredom is almost nonexistent once you&#x27;ve become adapted to life in the woods. If you don&#x27;t have any work that needs to be done, you can sit for hours at a time just doing nothing, just listening to the birds or the wind or the silence, watching the shadows move as the sun travels, or simply looking at familiar objects. And you don&#x27;t get bored. You&#x27;re just at peace.<p>Ted Kaczynski",1442123742

10210474,comment,10210327,10210327,0,0,schoen,,,"Snyder says in the interview:<p>> [Hitler] was a kind of racial anarchist who thought that the only good in the world was for races to compete, and so he thought that the Germans would probably win in a racial competition, but he wasn’t sure. And as far as he was concerned, if the Germans lost, that was also alright.<p>I don&#x27;t know how accurate other historians think this view of Hitler was, but I&#x27;ve also seen it in Borges&#x27;s short story &quot;Deutsches Requiem&quot;. I just re-read it and the entire story is an exact expression of this perspective, from the point of view of a fictional concentration camp superintendent who worships violence and conflict. There are dozens of paraphrases in the story of what Snyder thinks Hitler believed.<p>For instance:<p>> Hitler thought that he was fighting for <i>a</i> nation, but he was fighting for <i>all</i> nations, even for those he attacked and abominated. [...] There are many things that must be destroyed in order to build the new order; now we know that Germany was one of them. We have given something more than our lives; we have given the life of our belovèd nation. [..] Now an implacable age looms over the world. We forged that age, we who are now its victim. What does it matter that England is the hammer and we the anvil? What matters is that violence, not servile Christian acts of timidity, now rules. [...] (trans. Andrew Hurley)<p>Original:<p>> Hitler creyó luchar por <i>un</i> país, pero luchó por todos, aun por aquellos que agredió y detestó. [...] Muchas cosas hay que destruir para edificar el nuevo orden; ahora sabemos que Alemania era una de esas cosas. Hemos dado algo más que nuestra vida, hemos dado la suerte de nuestro querido país. [...] Se cierne ahora sobre el mundo una época implacable. Nosotros la forjamos, nosotros que ya somos su víctima. ¿Qué importa que Inglaterra sea el martillo y nosotros el yunque? Lo importante es que rija la violencia, no las serviles timideces cristianas. [...]<p>(I wonder if Snyder has ever read this story.)",1442123127

10210472,comment,10208508,10209823,0,0,pron,,,"Many would disagree. Most on-line programs have various deadlines and scheduling requirements that are nothing at all like compilers. Their challenge is the allocation of computing resources among concurrent request in a way that tries to ensure timeliness. Some of them are also required to guarantee some coherence of distributed data. Their concerns include scheduling fairness, safety, liveness, timeliness and coherence -- very different from those of a compiler. They&#x27;re not a compiler &quot;running in a loop&quot;.<p>I think the best classification of programs was given by Gérard Berry[1], creator of Esterel, a very influential imperative, fully verifiable language for reactive systems[2]:<p><i>Computerized systems can be divided into three broad categories:</i><p>* <i>Transformational systems compute output values from input values, and then stop. Most numerical computation programs, payroll programs, and compilers are transformational.</i><p>* <i>Interactive systems constantly interact with their environment in such a way that the computers can be viewed as the masters of the interaction. A user calls for services, the system listens to him when it can, and it delivers the services when they are available. Operating systems, centralized or distributed databases, and the Internet are interactive.</i><p>* <i>Reactive systems, also called reflex systems, continuously react to stimuli coming from their environment by sending back other stimuli. Contrarily to interactive systems, reactive systems are purely input-driven and they must react at a pace that is dictated by the environment. Process controllers or signal processors are typical reactive systems.</i><p>In another paper (The Foundations of Esterel) he expounds:<p>* <i>In interactive systems... [t]he computer (network) is the leader of the interaction, and clients wait to be served. The main concerns are deadlock avoidance, fairness, and coherence of distributed information.<p></i> <i>In reactive systems, the pace of the interaction is determined by the environment, not the computers. Most often, clients cannot wait. The main concern are correctness (safety) and timeliness.</i><p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Berry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Berry</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://home.ku.edu.tr/~stasiran/ecoe560/Papers/EsterelPrimerBerry.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://home.ku.edu.tr/~stasiran/ecoe560/Papers/EsterelPrimer...</a>",1442123116

In my experience, its magic is having no magic - everything is straightforwardly simple, the entire interpreter core fits inside the L1 cache, every single operator is doing sequential read/writes and (essentially) blasting through memory at the highest speed.<p>I&#x27;ve used Matlab ages ago (before they used to JIT), so I can&#x27;t compare, but I did have a chance to compare K and &quot;straight&quot; Numpy, and for my uses K won by a nontrivial margin (30-40% IIRC) despite using essentially the same solution, and Numpy having comparable implementation -- I guess that&#x27;s where the cache and memory speed effects come in.<p>I did venture into using numexpr, which got Numpy a little faster than K, and I would assume Numba and PyPy (neither of which was in existence or usable at the time) might have also helped -- but plain Numpy vs. K was a clear win for K.<p>It obviously depends on the workload - but I specifically commented about Gorilla - which is a write-a-lot, read-a-little kind of workload, in which K excels and Numpy (as I remember it from 6 years ago) not so much.",1442122980
10210466,comment,10203538,10207926,0,0,xahlee,,,"which way to use let is just a personal taste.<p>When i begin in elisp, i ALWAYS stick with this form of using local var:<p><pre><code>    (let (x y z)
     (setq ...)
     (setq ...)
     (setq ...)
     ...
    )
</code></pre>
This makes it easier to read all local variable names. Especially when readers are beginners, non-professional programers, scientists, writers.<p>If we always use this simple style of let, what possible problem can it create?<p>• Does it creates algorithmic problem? 
• Does it slow down programs? 
• Does it violate some computer science principles? 
• Are there science based proof, or statistics, that shows this style does some damage, such as more difficult to maintain?<p>The only thing i can think of, is a matter of esthetics.<p>later on, sometimes i use this form<p><pre><code>    (let (x (y 3) (z 4)) body)
</code></pre>
with the condition that, if i set the variable in the let parameter, it must be constant. The value never changes in the body. And now sometimes i also use the (let* ...) form.<p>These variations are just sugar syntax. Not really important. It&#x27;s a bikeshedding problem.<p>The thing is, in emacs lisp, there&#x27;s no way to declare constants. And also, it is unnatural to code elisp or even Common Lisp without lots of setq or setf or similar.<p>In JavaScript, the issue is much worse.

Since this part is so important, compare your definition to other&#x27;s definitions. Then measure. Both yourself, and others with the same definition. Don&#x27;t measure against others that are using a different definition, you&#x27;ll be measuring different things.<p>Then, break the problem down into it&#x27;s constituent parts. One possible breakdown: domain specific software engineering knowledge, technical coding ability, raw mental processing speed, decision making strategies and execution, mental focus, engagement.<p>Then, go back, define each of those, then measure, then start to hack the ish out of them. Deliberate study and practice can make up for a substantial lack of innate ability.<p>Also, consider that your hearts just not in it or that this particular line of work doesn&#x27;t play to your natural strengths.<p>Supposing you&#x27;re decidedly committed, realize someone will always be better than you, and worse than you. Find a place in your team where you best contribute to the overall teams needs rather than measuring your performance using a single dimensional metric, and be ready to be flexible should that need to change in the future. Maybe your slow, but maybe the fast person is fast in 9 out of 10 things, and super-slow in 1 thing, which you happen to be medium at. Well, the team is better off if you take care of that 1 thing.

But, the problem with pills is they are one dimension solutions. Adderall also reduces your ability to think creatively. Prozac increases brain plasticity. Armodafinil is an understated but highly effective smart pill. Guanfacine strengthens executive functions via actions in the prefrontal cortex. Selegiline is another legitimate smart pill, that you need to be super careful administering. Protein and omega fatty acids are super important, on an everyday basis. Intermittent caloric restriction is intellectually beneficial. Basically, define, break it down, measure, repeat.

The 21inc thing sounds pretty bizarre to me as well, but there is more going on in the bitcoin world than just that.<p>I&#x27;m involved with a VPS hosting company called ChunkHost, and we&#x27;ve accepted bitcoin for many years. We&#x27;re not criminals, and we don&#x27;t tolerate criminals on our network, and nonetheless bitcoin has served us well as a means of payment. We&#x27;ve written on our blog[1] about how bitcoin payments are 20-30% of our revenue.<p>Another interesting company is purse.io -- they let you get something like a 20% discount on your Amazon purchases by paying in bitcoin. coffee.foldapp.com lets you get 20% off your Starbucks purchases by paying with bitcoin. Again, this is not a scam -- I use it and it works. Don&#x27;t you think this is a real benefit that real people could appreciate?<p>I&#x27;m curious how long you&#x27;ve been following bitcoin. I&#x27;ve been interested in it since 2009/2010, and have seen the goalposts move a great deal: every time a goal is reached, the critics change it so they can declare bitcoin a failure. First it was that &quot;you can&#x27;t buy anything for it,&quot; which was true until a pizza was sold for 10,000 bitcoins in mid-2010.<p>Then it was &quot;no store accepts it&quot; -- which was true until a few months later when you could buy things like web hosting from tiny bitcoin-only companies. Then it became &quot;no large company will ever accept it.&quot; That remained true for a while, but eventually Wordpress became the first large company to do so. Others like Newegg, Overstock, and even Microsoft followed soon after. &quot;Nobody will ever pay with it&quot; was another one, and that was shattered once those companies started posting bitcoin revenue which, despite being a tiny share of their overall revenue, showed that people were consistently spending their coins.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that grandma will be buying gas with bitcoin anytime soon (or ever) -- just that there is substance there: merchants accepting it, consumers spending it, and interesting things like purse.io that couldn&#x27;t exist without it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://chunkhost.com/blog/17%2Fbitcoin_revenue_in_2014"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chunkhost.com/blog/17%2Fbitcoin_revenue_in_2014</a>",1442121480

10210404,comment,10209993,10209993,0,0,datashovel,,,"It sounds like a broad topic.  You may want to screencast short sessions of yourself coding, and then run them back to see what&#x27;s taking longer.  Here are some more thoughts:<p>1) Research: Do you find that you don&#x27;t understand documentation of libraries, or don&#x27;t understand what makes one library better than another when you&#x27;re looking through your options (popular / common libraries)?  I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily indicative of slow cognitive skills.  I think it&#x27;s indicative of perhaps not asking the right questions when you go through the libraries to pick one in the first place.  As soon as you start trying to decide for yourself whether you prefer one library over another or start seeing strengths / weaknesses in the libraries you do / do not choose, this is a sign you are probably starting to &quot;get it&quot;.<p>2) Implementing the library:  Do you read the documentation first?  Or do you go straight to examples?  Bypassing documentation is not always a good thing.  Take the time up front to get familiar with what you&#x27;re working with so you have a good overview and understand in general how one would perform tasks with the library and how the author intended it to be used.  If documentation is sparse, look at the code.  Is it a highly popular library and you&#x27;re still having trouble understanding?  If so it&#x27;s not necessarily indicative of slow cognitive skills.  Just spend more time reading others&#x27; code.  By flexing that muscle (like with other mental exercises) it should improve with time.<p>3) Specifications.  Does the company / client provide specifications?  Or are you on your own and need to research the requirements of the project from scratch in order to assess what the project needs.  Depending on the specifics and what the company / client&#x27;s expectations are you may want to consider if cutting corners is appropriate.  For example is this a Minimum Viable Product?  If so cutting corners is probably ok as long as it meets requirements of the project.  That&#x27;s not necessarily a tip for improving but a practical point in that it&#x27;s never useful to write code for a project that will never be used, so having a clear idea of requirements for the project is critical in order to know what can or cannot be left out of the implementation.<p>4) How often do you think abstractly about the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve?  Generally speaking in order to truly harness the power of programming and improve your speed to get common tasks done quickly, you should find ways to write layers of code just beneath your specific implementation to facilitate the implementation of common components (for example, an authentication system).<p>It&#x27;s also sometimes a good idea to practice writing the entire component (if not for work then in spare time) from scratch.  This way you will have gone through all the agony yourself and understand the real pain points in implementing components for a system and will be better equipped to choose libraries that truly help you to accomplish what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish.  If you&#x27;ve done this a number of times and still wouldn&#x27;t be able to identify pain points or have ideas for how to abstract common tasks into libraries / classes of their own, then you may just not be thinking critically enough about the problems you&#x27;re trying to solve.",1442120510

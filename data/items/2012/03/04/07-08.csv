3662278,comment,3660417,3660417,4,0,mkn,,,"I think the entire discussion would be helped by the simple realization that programming is not really all that glamorous nor scientific. It seems like a lot of programmers have math envy, but programming is much more like managing an office staffed with savants than it is like discovering a proof; You tell the workers in the office what to do, using very specific instructions because they can't figure out what you mean, no matter how blindingly obvious it is to you, even though any one of them can add two numbers together in a billionth of a second.<p>Given that, we can probably look to progress in the ""science"" of management to get a feel for what progress in the ""science"" of language design is going to look like. That is to say, we probably can't expect anything at all in the way of progress. It's funny that there's a parallel between the conclusions in William Whytes' ""The Organization Man"" and ""progress"" in language design. Whyte concludes, one, that management in the abstract doesn't actually exist and, two, ""management"" taken as organizational oppressiveness and intrusion is actually a parasitic load on people trying to get work done, and ought be minimized. Look at the success of weakly-typed scripting languages like perl, js, ruby, python, and so on: the fewer strictures they impose on the data, the more work you can get done!<p>Researchers are just going to have to get over math and physics envy. The ""truths"" they discover are very unlikely to be anything like nearly as universal as physical truths. Structured programming, OOP, AOP, functional programming, or whatever else aren't ever going to fit into a proposition like ""If we adopt ____, we find that blah,"" where blah is any kind of contingent claim relating to bugs or productivity. All we'll ever get are notions that whatever paradigm worked well in one context and poorly in another. Again, this is parallel to management. You can't manage programmers like auto workers like farm workers like service workers. Outside of algorithmic analysis, computer ""science"" has as little to say about programmer efficiency as management science has to say about how many weeks of parental leave you should give your employees.",1330847323

I think you pulled it out of your arse, but would love to know.  What I found was, European r&d spending is close to what the USA spends.  Individual countries spend more as a percentage of GDP than USA.  World wide, USA does not appear to be spending anywhere close to 70% of the total on medical r&d.<p>* 2011 Nobel prize for medicine went to an international crew (2 from europe, 1 USA)<p>* 2010 Nobel prize for medicine went to a British man.<p>* 2009 2 women from the USA, and one man from UK.<p>* 2008 1 german man, 1 french woman, 1 french man.<p>Anyway, medical care isn't just about what drugs multi national companies produce (with much funding from Asia and actual research done in Asia and sales done in USA+worldwide).  It includes things like reducing obesity, stopping people smoking in bars, and providing good medical care for all people - which reduces sickness spreading.  It does take research, and development to figure these things out and implement them on a social level successfully.  Many of these things are classed as social science, and not included in R&D in many places.  They can't even get R&D funding for this stuff in some places because it is not real science apparently.<p>Tax credits for r&d also distort the real costs. The UK gives 225% r&d tax credits, and Australia gives 175% tax credits of the cost now(USA has them too, but lower).  This means you make money purely from just doing the R&D without worrying about the results.<p>btw, the USA is massively in debt, and over 22% of US companies being foreign controlled.  So even if the US companies were contributing that much R&D, shouldn't that proportion be attributed somewhat to other countries?  With all the funding into the USA also coming from other countries, shouldn't some of that be counted towards the other countries?  Shouldn't the fact that lots of the workers in R&D labs for US companies have been outsourced to other countries count towards those countries?",1330845470

3662214,comment,3661947,3661947,34,0,nhashem,,,"When I was in high school (late 90s), they had kind of a weird curriculum for teaching programming.  We had AP classes for Computer Science A/AB, which you had to be at least a sophomore to take.  There was also a class called 'Computer Programming' that anyone could take, which I did as a freshman, although the students in the class were actually pretty evenly distributed between all four grades.<p>Basically we were taught QBASIC and given assignments.  The first few weeks seemed pretty mundane as the OP describes, getting into conditionals and loops, etc, but after we learned those, my teacher told us to make something like 'Choose Your Own Adventure' text-based game.  I remember loving that assignment and even compiling it as an EXE and sending it to my other friends.  This pretty much followed through the whole year, learning some new programming concept (arrays, functions, etc) and then making some sort of game as an assignment.  We had the usual ""write a program to display all the factors of a number"" assignments too, but I just remember loving the game projects.  I didn't know anything about Big-O or AVL trees or whatever, just that I could create cool stuff on a computer.<p>In 10th grade I took Computer Science A, and about half the class hadn't taken Computer Programming already.  The material was a lot drier, obviously, and I remember a lot of those students switched out.  I witnessed the same thing my freshman year of college --  no 'Choose Your Own Adventure Games' as an assignments, just grueling midterms on polymorphism and inheritance.<p>So this post really resonated with me, because my thoughts have basically echoed this for awhile -- why isn't software engineering taught as a discipline that can let you implement and create, since that's exactly what it is?",1330845087

The phrase ""the company agreed on a price"" suggests there might have been.  But not necessarily; they might have been talking about what the price would be if they did a deal.<p>If there was a handshake deal, the company should certainly have stuck with the original VC.  Not because of any complicated rules about who introed whom to whom, but simply because you have to honor handshake deals.<p>If there was not a handshake deal, it's less clear.  The company seems to have been fairly eager to raise money.  Which implies they'd have taken a sufficiently good deal if one was offered.  Which implies it had been in the investors' power to get a handshake deal if they wanted one, and if they didn't have one, they essentially blew it by negotiating too hard. If so then I don't think the company would be obliged to stick with the original investor.\nBut I'm just speculating; it's impossible to say for sure without knowing more.",1330844950

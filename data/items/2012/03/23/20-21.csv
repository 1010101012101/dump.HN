And that's fine. Maybe getting jealous because they see it as a path to riches and have been reading about to many outliers. Or maybe wanting to change the world.<p>But the job that he does is known as a ""hospitalist"" in this country. (Essentially Internal Medicine but not office practice).<p><a href=""http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/</a><p>My wife is one,  and practices in a very modern hospital system. I've asked her many times about ""the handoff (signout)"" from the first time we were dating. Because it seemed outdated to me that when we were at dinner (and she was on call) she had to scribble down notes about sometimes 20 patients over the phone). But apparently the verbal interaction is important as well between two doctors and can't easily be summarized in writing. And I've overheard plenty of handoffs and can attest to the interactions between doctors and the nuance that can't be expressed in writing. (I even said why can't the other doctor just record something that you can listen to and a million other ideas and she shot all of them down very easily as not being practical. And she had every reason to support an idea like that if she thought it would make me money..)<p>Getting things done is difficult, and yes, they are very closed minded and it's hard to get change.<p>But drawing a comparison with ""Considering I can talk to my smartphone and tell it to send a message to my dad or remind me to water the plants when I get home"" doesn't take into account that whatever system is setup and accessed needs to be rock solid, dependable and can't fail in many degrees above your typical startup offering.<p>So this is a great ambitious idea that he has undertaken and I wish him well.  But my guess is that he will have to partner with a health system in order to get adoption of this idea and work out the kinks and prove the concept.",1332535913

Use batches too.<p>- Many times, i've seen Solr index documents faster than the database could create them (considering joins, denormalizing, etc).  Cache these somewhere so you don't have to recreate the ones that haven't changed.<p>- Set up and use the Solr caches properly.  Think about what you want to warm and when. Take advantage of the Filter Queries and their cache!  It will improve performance quite a bit.<p>- Don't store what you don't need for search.  I personally only use Solr to return IDs of the data.  I can usually pull that up easily in batch from the DB / KV store.  Beats having to reindex data that was just for show anyway...<p>- Solr (Lucene really) is memory greedy and picky about the GC type.  Make sure that you're sorted out in that respect and you'll enjoy good stability and consistent speed.<p>- Shards are useful for large datasets, but test first.  Some query features aren't available in a sharded environment (YMMV).<p>- Solr is improving quickly and v4 should include some nice cloud functionality (zookeeper ftw).",1332535779

The reason I would do this is because it is very much like the early days of PC development where you are closer to the hardware and the feedback loop is quick, it also cuts away the layers and layers of stuff that can be distracting in a less focused segment. While working through learning to develop on the Arduino I would start reading foundational theory books as the theory will start to click with what you are doing. From there once I had a good grasp of C/C++ and what is going on in the hardware, I would learn a Lisp and start reading the deeper theory books on the various algorithms and start implementing those algorithms in Lisp.

I suspect problems stem from the fact that purchasing decisions are generally made by individuals (management and senior hospital docs) other than those that use the systems (in the main junior hospital docs). The other issue is that systems are implemented to reflect the way that diseases and patients <i>should</i> behave but there are always edge cases that do not fit into these nice boxes. Striking a balance between free-form data input, which does not add much compared to conventional paper notes, and forcing patient data into categories and drop-down boxes is a a real challenge. The other thing that is often forgotten is the amount of clinician effort required for a system. If it takes too long or is too complicated accurate data will simply not be entered in the absence of draconian sanctions from above.

My best metaphor is, it feels a little like I wanted to go out and learn about Catholicism and they said, ""oh, that's easy, we'll just have you sit in on a bunch of confessions and you'll figure it out in no time.""

3747110,comment,3746692,3746881,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"> They should use all languages and pick that one that is best for the job.<p>That's certainly a correct answer, but it's correct because it's almost tautological. 'The language that I like the most is the one that's best [for what I want to do]'. The issue is that, in this question, 'favorite' is a bit vague, and the task isn't specified. (This is why I have a problem choosing 'favorites'.)<p>Despite that, in this situation, I interpret it to mean 'What [general-purpose] language has the best design?' Theoretically, a perfectly-designed language would be designed in such a way that it has an absolute advantage over <i>all</i> other languages for <i>every</i> type of task.<p>Given that definition, it follows naturally that I would choose Lisp - it's actually not my strongest language, but even a novice Lisper can see that Lisp is both as minimal as possible <i>and</i> yet as powerful as possible . Since it's a shapeshifter of sorts, it can adapt itself perfectly to any setting.<p>The drawbacks with Lisp (in my view) have nothing to do with the design of the language itself, but rather the environment. The libraries of languages like Perl and Python are much larger, by sheer fact that the community is larger. Lisp is cross-platform, but the installation (quicklisp aside) is still messier than Ruby's gem-based packaging or Python's eggs. And lastly, because most people don't learn functional programming as their first step, it's got a learning curve.<p>But none of those are problems with the <i>language</i> itself - at least not the design of the language. (I'm assuming here that we're dealing with high-level languages - it wouldn't really make sense to compare x86 assembly to Python - if you're writing assembly, you probably have a very good reason, and Python isn't even on the table).<p>So in the end, your answer to this all determines on how you interpret the question, so it's fun to see what the results are... just don't try and compare them directly - I think anybody who interpreted the question the way I did would probably choose Lisp, but it's clear from the comments that many other people interpret this a different way.<p>(Thankfully HN is good at avoiding flamewars, but I'm sure everyone here has seen enough useless 'debate' of this same topic on other forums to understand why I mention it!)",1332534627

Say I'm programming in Prolog, for instance.\nIn the beginning, I'll be like ""Wow, such expressiveness"". But inevitably I'll do something that is outside the scope of Prolog and it will be as slow as hell. That's when I think to myself: ""if I could just fix this little part... I miss C"". So when I'm back programming in C I'll think ""now my code is fast"", but then inevitably: ""if I could just find a way to do this without so much repetition"".<p>In the end, it comes down as a ""right tool for the job"" thing. One possible ideal would be do the things Prolog is good at in Prolog, the things C is good at in C (and also throw in some  Python, Erlang, Lisp, etc). Except most of the time this is infeasible.

She has significant brain damage, which has introduced a huge ""shake"" into the movements of the one arm/hand she can control.  She's not expected to get better in that regard.<p>She keeps trying to use keyboards & tablets, but due to her limited motor control, she cannot effectively type, which seriously frustrates her.  Basically, she hits the key she wants too many times, along with a ""constellation"" of the keys around the target.<p>I'm wondering if there is a programmatic solution to this that would allow her to type.<p>My conceptualization of the problem is that the program would need to buffer all of the keystrokes coming in, and ""screen"" them by assuming for a character to actually be accepted as input, it must be his a certain number of times (i.e. and adjustable threshold).  Basically, imagine that if, while brain-damaged, you want to type  ""hi"", you're going to hit the constellation of keys around the ""h"" key N times, but fewer than the number of times you successfully land on the ""h"" itself.  Repeat with ""i"".  The output looks something like ""ughhjyhyhhhhh"" and ""uiuioiiioi"".<p>I feel like you could try and measure a user's individual keystrike accuracy through a few trials of typing something like our above ""hi"", which would then adjust thresholds appropriately, allowing other programs to ignore the mistakenly pressed keys.  You could give the user a sort of customized ""landing pad"" where they need to hit their choice key somewhere between, say, 4-7 times before it actually registers, which would screen out all of the others key that get accidentally pressed in the attempt.<p>Once a character gets accepted as intentionally struck, clear buffer and continue.<p>This leads to my questions:<p>1) Is this possible?<p>2) How difficult would it be to implement on a laptop or tablet (no OS preference).<p>3) Does this seem like the best way to go about solving this problem (user cannot accurately strike keys), or am I overcomplicating it?<p>Thank you.<p>Additional disclosures: I'm a weak programmer (basic python, basic java), and have never written anything that didn't stand by itself (i.e. no OS interfaces, hooking, etc).  I'm way out of my depth -- I just want to help give her back some quality of life.  Also, she can't speak right now, so voice recognition is out.",1332533866

It's currently on 34, beating C++ (29), and in the same region as C# and Java.<p>What I am surprised at however is that C# and Java (37 and 35) are doing as well in this poll as they are. It seems that Java in particular is disliked here for it's heavy reliance on classes, classes everywhere, while C# is more approved of, but still disliked.

Medicine is the application of the already known. (Most med students are not going to be the next DeBakey.) Rather than contributing original work, most doctors seem to be well-paid (and deservingly so) blue collar workers. If someone turns down a med school acceptance, that school can instantly pull 100 names of their waitlist who will be more-or-less just as qualified.<p>Sivakumar is right in that there aren't many doctors who can also code.

Go is already batching up the writes, hence the apparent speed advantage.<p>If you strace the client, you see that the ""get"" case was replying with two send calls, one for the ""VALUE"" line, another with the value and ""END"". All the time is consumed with the client waiting to receive that second message. Depending on the client, and I tried a bunch of ways, it's either in 'poll' (pylibmc), 'futex' (Go), or 'recv' (basic python socket). That second receive is about two orders of magnitude slower than the previous recv.<p>Why does reading that second line take so much longer?<p>There's more detail here: <a href=""https://github.com/grahamking/Key-Value-Polyglot/pull/5#issuecomment-4667123"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/grahamking/Key-Value-Polyglot/pull/5#issu...</a>",1332533043

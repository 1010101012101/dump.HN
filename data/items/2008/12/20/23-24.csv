IMO the goal should be to be profitable based on your income stream.

When one of us replies then we BCC the other so they know not to reply too, but this is obviously a pain. Additionally if we reply from our personal address then the other person no longer receives future messages in the thread.<p>As well as solving these two problems, it'd be useful to bring some more of the team into the process so they at least can read the incoming support requests to get an idea of user feedback - this would quickly get out of hand with our current simple setup.<p>Any recommendations?\nCheers!",1229816659

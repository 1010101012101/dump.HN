In fact about 95% of all Haskell I write - and I write quite a bit - is for commercial stuff, ranging all the way across large-ish (not quite google-scale, yet) scale computation, distributed systems, machine learning, modeling/simulations and web development. More academic feeling stuff like parsing and DSLs are just the cherries on top (though even those were for commercial uses).<p>I'll admit Haskell has a steep learning curve, but once you're there, all this stuff Go is said to do real well feels fairly lackluster compared to what you can find in Haskell-land. What's built into Go can be achieved at the library level in Haskell. As a result, we keep seeing better and better manifestations of key ideas in the library space.<p>Examples include Cloud Haskell, many, many concurrency libraries, STM, Parallel Haskell, many constant-space data streaming libraries (pipes, conduits, enumerators, ...),  several excellent parsing libraries (parsec, attoparsec, trifecta, ...), etc.<p>As a side note, I used to do lots of python/ruby - I really can't anymore. They feel simultaneously more burdensome to code (no static type-checking), more verbose (no elegant, long pipelines of computations), less expressive (no <i>real</i> first class functions - you barely use map/reduce/fold/etc. in python) and slower (as in runtime).<p>Having said all that, I do see how Go fills a gap in the market. You need something that's easy to grok and gets just enough of it right that you can produce fast, type-safe-enough and concurrent programs with somewhat less mutable state than what you may be used to in C. A simple mental model and ease of entry are conceivably great for larger, homogeneous teams.",1343368773

Nobody buys a VPS on the first click; if someone clicks through a google ad for my company, yeah, google should get some credit, but most of the credit should go to the blog the customer saw a month ago.
That's the thing; because the adwords are the first hits and are super convenient for the customer, they pick up a lot of people that would have clicked on the organic result.</i><p>This is called attribution measurement. It is generally considered the <i>next big thing</i> in advertising technology - primarily by anyone who runs a website where buying intent isn't obvious.<p><i>I think this is also why facebook is so highly valued; people believe that facebook has enough tracking data to see that blog that my customer read last week that actually caused the customer to sign up through the adword this week.</i><p>Facebook isn't valued because of this, it is valued because of the sheer volume of people.

The nature of people's behavior on the Web and of how they interact with advertising, as well as the character of those ads themselves and their inability to command attention, has meant a marked decline in advertising's impact.</i><p>original article: http://www.technologyreview.com/news/427972/the-facebook-fallacy/<p>I'm having trouble understanding what is meant by ""efficiency of ads"" and how that lowers ad value.
I understand effectiveness, I think: users are habituated to ads and click/notice them less and less over time. Thus ads lose value. (Site operators can't charge advertisers as much)<p>But efficiency seems to be about targeting users more efficiently. How does efficiency lower ad value? It seems advertisers should be willing to pay more for more efficient ads?",1343366561

I had an ""epiphany"" idea in software. Invested quite a bit in R&D to see if it worked. It did not. A while later, had an epiphany on the epiphany and so on.<p>The final solution, which is patent pending, took me quite a few years and quite a bit of money (not including opportunity costs) to figure out. It could be I'm just not that smart and that is why it took me so long. However, I've never seen anyone implement this type of technology. No patent, startup, software that exists already. I've seen people over the last 20 years try to solve the problem I've solved, but without success.<p>Would this fall under something that should not be patented?",1343366449
4300137,comment,4296898,4299947,9,0,icambron,,,"A con by whom? Obviously, you may not enjoy living close to other people and will choose to live in lower density areas. Fair enough, and, at least in the US, we're not short on space. (I will only add that density is typically measured as people per square foot <i>of ground</i>, meaning you might simply be above and below your neighbors). But creating environments where people <i>can</i> live in higher densities can't be a bad thing.<p>And the benefits are manifold for those who do want to live in cities. Diversity of options is a big one--that food truck that serves gluten-free venison tacos can only exist somewhere with enough people that such a niche can survive, so the long tail of preferences can be accommodated. Infrastructure is in dense places is cheaper per capita; tearing up one road/pipe/sewer can benefit thousands of people instead of just whoever lives in that one cul-de-sac. Public transportation becomes more practical, enabling people to go where they want cheaper and more easily. A higher concentration of jobs and workers means there can be a better matching of needs and skills, making businesses more successful and workers happier.<p>So sure, you may wish to forgo all that to have a yard and some space. I'm sure the housing market and broadband companies will oblige. But in general, practical dense cities will be a boon to society, from which we'll all benefit.<p>Edit: clarity.",1343366426

These companies refuse to roll out fiber, but also lobby for state laws against government-funded fiber[1]. The end result is that residents are left on decrepit old copper lines.<p>Now there's a large[2] company rolling out fiber, and they have shown explicit desire to work with local governments. Depending on how the laws are written, it might be possible to achieve something close to a municipal network by contracting out to Google. And the Google fiber seems to be cheaper -- I can't find any municipal fiber services offering gigabit for less than $120.<p>(bias disclaimer: I work for Google, but am not involved at all in fiber stuff)<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/03/cable-backed-anti-muni-broadband-bill-advances-in-north-carolina/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/03/cable-backed-anti...</a><p>[2] Sonic.net deploys fiber, also priced at $70 a month, but they are a very small regional ISP. <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/06/1gbps-fiber-for-70in-america-yup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/06/1gbps-fiber-for-7...</a>",1343366300

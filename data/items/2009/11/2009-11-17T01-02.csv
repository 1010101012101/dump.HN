They could easily double or triple Apple's iPhone revenue next year -- perhaps to the point where they'd have a bigger market cap than Microsoft -- imagine how that would make Steve Jobs feel.

Now, no matter what you use, UUID, MD5, SHA1/2/256 etc. to them it won't make a difference and that may mean that you will lose users.<p>Based on that, my suggestion would be to do what you said above, make them all private and use authenticated access control.

This will defend you against all the flaws that using an unique ID would have.<p>The second step is to ensure that your secret links don't leak. You can employ robots.txt to disallow robots, use dereferer.org or anonym.to to hide away referers, but you still won't be secure, as someone can still copy and paste the link. If that is ok with you, then you can stop reading now.<p>You could of course add an EC2 machine between the user and your S3 storage that makes sure each link only works once, but this would be expensive and counter-effective. However, Amazon S3 allows you to create a request that can be made via HTTP GET and that is only valid until a specific time. (See the API documentation, chapter ""Authentication and Access Control""). This will allow you to generate a new URL every time you want to serve a file to your client. The URL will only be valid for a specific time period. The downside is, that this again is time-demanding and that all caching on the user side will be useless.<p>Good luck!",1258420496

945740,comment,945525,945717,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Mmm, a debate about debates. How meta.<p>I have a couple of problems with this. First, by broadly sweeping ""everything I don't like about arguments"" under the label ""ad hominem"", you're powerfully eroding the usefulness of the term. It has a specific use and purpose, and it's useful to understand the various fallacies in debate (<a href=""http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/</a>).<p>Also, you admit that this style of debate has a place in entertainment writing -- <i>in a thread about his letter to the editor</i>. This was not a formal debate, nor was it the appropriate forum for such; he was writing a response that would reach a large number of readers, and they were his audience.<p>Besides, aren't you committing the selfsame fallacy that you're accusing him of, according to your own rules? i.e., ""Gladwell used methods I don't like, so he's wrong.""<p>I wasn't aware that this was a Reddit meme. I stopped visiting Reddit some months ago, and my usage fell off even before then. I'm glad it is, though. If someone's going to try and bolster their criticism of someone else by using fancy Latin phrases, they really ought to get called out on it by someone that knows better.",1258420381

945732,comment,945504,945504,0,0,dasht,,,"That would seem to be a fairly deep architectural flaw.  Namely, that (roughly speaking) all users of the basecamp server experience performance and reliability roughly equal to that of those users experiencing the worst performance and reliability at any given moment.  The guys who depend on the service for $2^N value per day are in the same boat as those who depend on it as those who depend on it for $2^(N-K) value.   Each group that depends on it for $2^N value CAN NOT differentiate themselves, reliability, from their competitors who also rely on it for $2^N value.<p>That's old news, really.  It's well known that that's a problem with SaS, centralization, and applications without competition.  It's well known that it would be fixed by letting basecamp users install and run the system on servers under their own control with full software freedom over the thing (trading, probably, a little bit less reliability for each customer against faster recoveries for most and no ""global outages"" and the ability to invest in hardening the infrastructure for a competitive advantage)....  it's just interesting to see those theoretical defects confirmed in practice.",1258420026

945727,comment,945495,945495,0,0,gfodor,,,"There are two problems with the app store, but they are usually not recognized as separate problems:<p>- Apple unreasonably rejects applications.<p>- It takes 2 to 3 weeks to be told you've been rejected, and even then you only are given one reason even if there are several problems that need to be addressed.<p>My overall impression is that most of the complaints about the first point are simply due to the frustration borne of the second. It's not the rejection over the stupidest things that stings, it's the fact that you had to wait forever to be told ""you need to change your icon."" Then, after your five minute fix, it's back in the hopper for another three weeks. All the while competitors appear in the App Store, clients get pissed, and cash burns.<p>It's incredible to me that the embarassingly parallel problem of app approval wait time has not only been left unsolved, but has apparently gotten worse.<p>Imagine if the turnaround time on these things dropped from 3 weeks to a few hours. Being rejected would turn from a devestating event to a minor inconvenience, and I'd imagine that all this bad press would evaporate. Sure, you'd have some developers complain that their apps would never be approved due to impasses between them and Apple in terms of service violations, but I think these folks would be in the minority since most violations can be fixed once you're made aware of them.",1258419852

But, as I said, you never know with the Internet.<p>As much as i respect Umberto Eco, i have to say this is a very common mistake amongst people not acquainted with internet. Truth is, you never knew BEFORE the internet. What we account as the truth in books is based around the idea of truthfulness of a particular author. But in reality, and for big period of times in history, lies have been spread by books wich were thought as very respected. And as the 20th century showed us, the best way to prevent lies from spreading, is the free circulation of information.<p>Any clever kid on the street has the capacity to filter the information coming from the internet in a very efficient way. And when you know how to filter, interpret and analyze, i'll go as far as saying, internet is the best source for truth we ever had. Just pray for it to last ..",1258419603

Here's how I see it:<p><i>The night is darkest just before the dawn...or before it somehow gets even darker.</i><p>We read a lot of ""I stuck it out 1 more day and then we got rich"" stories but it's the same survivor bias that we see in all the startup stories. I would wager that for every 5 companies that ""just don't give up"", 4 of them eventually give up. But, the 4 that give up don't write self-congratulatory blog posts and give interviews about their failure. So, we only hear about the 1, never about the 4.",1327838341

That's almost always the wrong strategy to try to beat an incumbent.<p>The way you beat an incumbent leader is by changing the rules of the games so it's very hard for that company to play that new game, whether it's because they lack the competency or because the have internal conflicts of interest for doing that (think of the TV networks not really wanting to go full-web because it would eat into their much larger profits from traditional advertising).<p>Of course you don't just change the rules for the sake of changing the. This new game must also feel like the ""future"" of that market, and you need to be able to attract not only Hollywood ""non-consumption"", but also be able to transition Hollywood's ""consumers"" over time to your company (or companies - I still think that what would kill Hollywood is an entire different ecosystem for creating, distributing and watching movie, and not just a movie juggernaut like Hollywood).",1327837679

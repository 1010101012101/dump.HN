That's the right ballpark [1], but only on iPhone-sized devices. The iPad is 132 dpi [2], about 10% better than a typical CRT from a decade ago [3]. MacBook Pros recently got the first resolution increase (36%, to about 115 dpi) in about 5 years. At that rate it will be more than 20 years before we reach the limits of human visual perception on large displays.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00002G"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0...</a>

They've never played the resolution game. Remember 15"" laptops a few years ago? While Sony and other higher-end makers started cramming more pixels in each year, Apple slowly went from 1280x854 to 1440x900 and stopped there. Only in 2010 have they started to offer (and only as a BTO option!) the 1680x1050 res that you've been able to get on Vaios for years. Apple just prefers to concentrate on their antialiasing algorithms than to pump pixels.<p>I think a much more likely resolution bump would be 1.5x each dimension for 720x480. It'll be a little short of HTC and Motorola's 852x480, but if Apple doesn't cut the color resolution with a Bayer pattern, their display will still look better. And most importantly, it'll use less memory and run faster than a full 960x480.",1271713894

Certainly on x86 it's always an issue (EDIT: except on very specialized OSes, I suppose), as it is on J2ME (and I'd guess Symbian). Dedicated game consoles are pretty much the only place I can think of where your application will always run on absolutely known hardware.<p>I agree, both as a user and as a programmer, that the mess with Android 1.6 sticking around for essentially political reasons needs to improve fast. Minimal specs are nice, although they will necessarily change as the time progresses, and you will have to make a cut-off yourself. Support only Android phones released in the past two years (as an example, obviously not a useful guideline right now) and you will know what your lowest common denominator is.<p>On the other hand, even Apple's halcyon days of single-device uniformity are coming to an end. You now have two resolutions in iPhone OS to deal with, and if rumours are true, you'll have a third one in June (though that one's less of an issue since doubling should work acceptably). OSes 3.2 and 4.0 force you to consider both hardware and software keyboards. The iPhone 3G has less RAM available to an app than the 3GS and the iPad. CPU speeds are different on every release and I believe graphics performance differs too. New hardware features have been introduced that you have to check for.

That is simply not true and has not been my experience.  It is true that the VC's prefer C-Corp but they never insist on investing in companies that are C-Corp.  The best way is actually for the entrepreneurs to form an LLC to take advantage of the tax structure and flexibility, then when you are ready to take VC money, just let them form a C-Corp and acquire your LLC.  It is not complicate and don't let any lawyers/accountants tell you otherwise.",1271710807

Even in elementary physics you could argue that the word problems in many cases aren't practical, but we teach it to teach the <i>flavor</i> of the approach; the attitude of how we attack problems (or, less poetically, what exactly we mean when we say ""cause and effect"").<p>That said, the motivation is still greater when the students see some hope that what they are learning is meaningful.<p>What that motivation is depends on the level of the class.  For algebra 2, it might be ""we learn to manipulate rational functions because it gives us a tool to understand (or solve) a certain class of problems.  Someday you may own a business where you have to worry about the average cost of something that depends on things that change alot, or variables as we call them.  And you know what an average is: it's the amount of something divided by how many there are.  Well if your amounts are represented by an algebraic expression, and your total is represented by an algebraic expression, then the quantity you will be interested in will look something like this (writes a rational function on the board).  Now, what the fuck do we do with this?""",1271710806

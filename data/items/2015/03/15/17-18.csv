For software I expect other teams to use, who don&#x27;t necessarily care about the fact that it was written in Go, I prefer pflag.",1426442396

At no time since the second world war has the private sector built at the rate now required, and usually it has fallen a long way short.</i><p>Worth noting for folks who think that supply is the only problem. Similarly in my home of Vancouver the construction of towers has been constant for decades and prices have only skyrocketed in response.<p>Certainly if you stopped building completely you&#x27;d eventually have a real problem, but the evidence is clear to me that you&#x27;ll never reach the incredible supply levels that would cause prices to drop (why would builders do this anyway?).<p><i>There is also what Ebenezer Howard, the inventor of garden cities, called the “unearned increment”, which is the uplift in value when land becomes available for housing. It was the basis on which postwar new towns were built. Currently it is being squandered – when the government, for example, relaxes planning constraints on certain properties, or makes it easier to convert offices or shops into homes they drench the lucky owners of such places in cash, without asking for much in return.</i><p>Vancouver captures this.

Some of the IDEs offer &quot;goto&quot; functions that will take you directly to where a function is defined, which would be nice.<p>- Code discovery: \nbpython displays function documentation and args;  with autocomplete these are really quick.  Granted, they&#x27;re not displayed whenever my cursor hits a function so an IDE would be convenient if you use this all the time.<p>- Integrated console, debugger, and VCS: \nWith Terminator I usually have a tab for each project, split into panes for console, logs, etc, etc.  They&#x27;re not displayed in the same window as my code but flipping between Emacs and Terminator is trivial.<p>- Refactoring support: \nEmacs has python-rope mode but it&#x27;s a bit clumsy.  This is one area where an IDE is probably better.<p>With my setup I have the keystrokes for the original tools (git, pdb, etc, etc.) under my fingers.  I have to use these tools outside of the IDE anyway so this way I only have to learn one set of keystrokes.<p>My Emacs configs live in a Git repo and I can install them wherever Emacs is installed and I have a user directory.<p>I run Emacs and Terminator on my desktop and edit code directly on VMs and remote systems via ssh[1].  This keeps my desktop free from cruft and lets me develop in a setup that&#x27;s close to my production setup.   IDEs all seem to require that the code be on the same system as the IDE.  Maybe they can but the ability wasn&#x27;t obvious or well documented and I confess I didn&#x27;t spend much time looking.<p>I do mostly back-end web programming and system administration.

The factors that contribute to commercial success very much depend on the market that you&#x27;re operating in and on your company&#x27;s individual circumstances.<p>They can include product quality, marketing and PR, cost structure, reach, scale (and economies thereof), revenues, growth, cash flow, and management&#x27;s ability in a range of areas from crisis management and dealing with bad publicity, to setting the strategy and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise.<p>For startups who will need to raise more investment rounds, attractiveness to investors also becomes a factor.<p>Processing credit card payments is a mature market with a commoditised product/service and clear business model. Everyone pretty much offers the same service and, for <i>most</i> customers, price (i.e. how much commission they charge) is the most important differentiating factor[1]. It&#x27;s a very different market from, say, smartphones, where people are prepared to pay a premium for a &quot;better&quot; product (e.g. the iPhone) despite the fact that they all have the same basic functionality.<p>When it comes to competing on price, you ideally want to have a lower cost base than your competitors, so you can lower your prices (i.e. charge lower commissions), while still making a profit. One way of reducing your cost-per-transaction (or cost-per-customer) is to exploit economies of scale.<p>You achieve economies of scale by getting more customers and transaction volume. Marketing is an obvious way to achieve this. And, in a zero-sum market like credit card payments, every customer you win is a customer your competitors can&#x27;t have.<p>That&#x27;s why companies like Stripe are focused so much on growth and expanding into different geographical markets. If they can achieve scale quicker than their competitors, they&#x27;ll have a competitive advantage and they&#x27;ll be able to undercut competitors who haven&#x27;t managed to achieve the same scale (e.g. Balanced).<p>Other markets are different. In some, customers discriminate on product quality instead of price, or technical excellence (i.e. efficiency) enables a lower cost base.<p>1: Occasionally, a payments processing company will distinguish itself by establishing a lead in a particular area (e.g. ease of integration) but the competitive advantage is usually short-lived. On this thread, there&#x27;s much commentary about specific features but these don&#x27;t matter to the vast majority of customers.",1426440018

Like trade.<p><i>No serious military historian doubts that fear of their use has been a major factor in preventing conflict between great powers.</i><p>Well, between two Great Powers -- the former USSR and the USA. Does anyone really think the only thing preventing China, the USA, and Russia from engaging in all-out war is the threat of nuclear annihilation? Everyone stands more to gain from trade.<p><i>Moreover deaths of non-combatants have been steadily rising. Around a million of the 10 million deaths due to the first world war were of non‑combatants, whereas around half of the more than 50 million casualties of the second world war and over 90% of the millions who have perished in the violence that has wracked the Congo for decades belong in that category.</i><p>That&#x27;s disingenuous. Historically whole villages and towns, even cities, were routinely laid to waste.<p>Gray&#x27;s article is sufficiently hand-wavey and cherry-picky to not even bother with.<p>From Taleb&#x27;s critique:<p><i>Loss of the Island Effect: My point now is the loss of island effect, from interconnectedness. The number one danger is a biological agent that can travel on British Air and reach the entire planet. And it can be built in a high school lab, or, even, a garage.</i><p>That sounds a bit sensationalist. A biological agent that has the potential to be the <i>number one danger</i> can be built in a <i>high school lab, or, even, a garage.</i> Well, ok, sure, given a sufficiently equipped high school lab or garage -now we might as well call it a Biological Weapons Facility- but built by whom?  Surely not high school students or me.<p>Generating a sufficiently virulent biological agent isn&#x27;t trivial, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s impossible. Maybe at some point in the future I&#x27;ll be able to &#x27;3D print&#x27; a biological agent with all the right traits. Let&#x27;s hope that never happens.<p>Taleb&#x27;s statement above trivialises biological weapons, and spreads FUD.<p><i>Nuclear Potential: As I explain in Antifragile, risk management is about fragility, not naive interpretation of past data. If Fannie Mae is sitting on a barrel of dynamite I would not use past statistical data for my current analysis. Risks are in the fragility.(Sensitivity to counterfactuals is more important than past history, something Greenspan missed in his famous congressional testimony).</i><p>Pinker in &#x27;The Better Angels of Our Nature&#x27; does repeatedly point out that we can&#x27;t assume anything about the future based on the past but that there does appear to be a trajectory. Whether Pinker is wrong about that trajectory is beside the point here because Taleb is taking issue with <i>naive interpretation of past data</i>, yet Pinker wrote in the same book &quot;Social scientists should never try to predict the future; they have enough trouble predicting the past.&quot;<p><i>Pinker conflates nonscalable Mediocristan (death from encounters with simple weapons) with scalable Extremistan (death from heavy shells and nuclear weapons). The two have markedly distinct statistical properties. Yet he uses statistics of one to make inferences about the other. And the book does not realize the core difference between scalable/nonscalable (although he tried to define powerlaws). He claims that crime has dropped, which does not mean anything concerning casualties from violent conflict.</i><p>I&#x27;m half way through reading &#x27;The Better Angels of Our Nature&#x27; and that certainly isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d say about the book. Pinker admits that simple weapons and nuclear weapons are different, but that he focus on death rates in <i>war</i> over time. Pinker treats civilian <> civilian deaths separately as &#x27;murders&#x27;, so surely Taleb isn&#x27;t conflating murder and simple-weapon-war-deaths.<p><i>Another way to see the conflation, Pinker works with a times series process without dealing with the notion of temporal homogeneity. Ancestral man had no nuclear weapons, so it is downright foolish to assume the statistics of conflicts in the 14th century can apply to the 21st. A mean person with a stick is categorically different from a mean person with a nuclear weapon, so the emphasis should be on the weapon and not exclusively on the psychological makeup of the person.</i><p>Should it? Why? Saying it should doesn&#x27;t make it so, and doesn&#x27;t convince. If we place the emphasis entirely on weapons potential this is most certainly game over. Yet global nuclear (and biological weapons) capacity has <i>decreased</i> since the height of the Cold War, and we&#x27;re still here. This is one point of &#x27;The Better Angels of Our Nature&#x27; -- that despite our ability we eradicate ourselves we&#x27;ve chosen -so far- not to, and Pinker acknowledges this means nothing about predicting the future.<p>Now, I can&#x27;t speak much for that part of the world I know little about, geographically & culturally, and also mathematics isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve studied a lot, so I&#x27;ll take it as given that Tabel&#x27;s paper &#x27;On the Super-Additivity and Estimation Biases of Quantile Contributions&#x27; is correct, and that Pinker&#x27;s time series data is shaky.<p>So good, I&#x27;ve learned something from Taleb, and I think it&#x27;s important to read criticisms.<p>Tabel&#x27;s paper doesn&#x27;t contain the words <i>child</i>, <i>women</i>, <i>race</i>, <i>religion</i>, <i>rights</i>, <i>animals</i>.<p>Edit: copy paste mistake resulted in only half my comment, corrected within 1 minute of posting.",1426439960

9207177,comment,9205177,9205607,0,0,polymathist,,,"I happen to know a few hackathon organizers and have an idea of how these things work under the hood. I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to judge. The reason Penn&#x27;s hackathon is application only is that they literally can only support a certain number of participants. There&#x27;s a limit to how many people they can feed, fit in one building, control in a big crowd, etc. Some hackathons manage this limit by accepting participants first come, first serve. Penn decided to take what they consider to be the best applicants, and I don&#x27;t blame them for that. Their goal as organizers is to impress sponsors enough so that they can do it again next year. There&#x27;s no evidence that this sort of conversation happened.<p>People are right in criticizing some aspects of the hackathon culture, but be careful about generalizations. For example, HackDuke has taken steps to include beginners with a series of seminars in the off-season (and by offering a beginner prize), encourage projects that do social good (as opposed to just &quot;hacks&quot;), and they encourage people to continue working on their projects after the hackathon is over. Disclaimer: I went to Duke and participated in their hackathons (and greatly enjoyed them!).",1426439360

Tell autoprefixer what browser versions to support\n    3.

Probably not, as the author admits. Basically the title is meaningless.<p>Secondly, Kirwin (the author) is making the classic mistake of seeing all these big massive companies entering the market and thus declaring that Netflix is doomed. The problem is that for these companies, video is an afterthought compared to the main product. Netflix is completely focused on video. There have been countless cases of nimbler, smaller companies out-executing larger, broader companies. I can understand why the author makes this mistake - his background is primarily in film production and working at Paramount and Microsoft (the article says he has worked at some startups, but none that I could find on his site).<p>I find it ironic that Kirwin is calling out tech bloggers for being ""wannabe Hollywood analysts,"" when it seems to me that he is a Hollywood blogger writing as a wannabe tech analyst.",1353822988

You need to scale comparisons accordingly (eg comparing the US to Canada where the latter has a workforce under 20 million).<p>Additionally it is far easier to move in the US.  There are no immigration requirements, language barriers, major cultural differences, different education systems, certifications (sometimes states differ) or similar impediments.  Many states are ""at will"" meaning that employment is not protected to the degree it is in many other countries.  This means that mobility can happen from both employee and employer sides.<p>I don't think job hopping is due to being self centred (in the pejorative sense). The US tends to be very productive which means employment and employees are more able to move around to meet needs.  That they do so is not a bad thing.<p>I've known couples where one works a big boring established company in order to bring in the healthcare while the other works at startups.  They would both prefer to work at startups but by the time people approach 40 there is likely to be some health issues forecast if not already happening.  (Even the fittest people wear out body parts!)<p>And if anything economic policies have been discouraging mobility.  Higher house/ing prices makes people sticky and diverts income into unproductive use, but seems to be a goal.  (We'd all be better off with a lot cheaper housing costs.)  The lack of competition in communications (largely due to regulatory capture) means that remote participation is a lot less effective than it could be.  And of course health care is dysfunctional and expensive, although the care received by some of the people some of the time is world leading.",1353822852

4827439,comment,4826896,4827166,4,0,michael_miller,,,"LLVM IR provides a clean API boundary separating the compiler frontend from the backend. This has two notable advantages: it limits the complexity and ""code tangle"" of combining two extremely complex pieces of software, and it lets you swap in new frontend / backend components easily. For example, if you want to develop a new language, you don't need to worry about writing a fancy optimizer or backends for X86 / ARM / MIPS / esoteric processor X: you just target LLVM, and you get an advanced optimizer outputting many instruction sets for free. Additionally, if you're creating a new instruction set, and you write an LLVM backend, you get the benefit of supporting every language outputting LLVM.",1353822669

4827436,comment,4827163,4827163,5,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"This article makes a couple good points, but the assumption that competitiveness can only be measured in capitalization is stupid. Anyone who believes that need simply review the proportion of acquisitions by fortune 500's that are still competitive in their markets 5 years later.<p>In annoying MBA language: cost of goods for cinematic content is falling rapidly due to technological and social progress, and this is reducing the negotiation power of large integrated production and marketing companies like the big studios.<p>The cost of script-writing and conceptual development is largely constant and independent of production cost. Nearly every feature of production cost is falling rapidly, from cameras to post production technologies. Even location shooting, which you might assume independent of technological factors, is being rapidly undercut by digital backdrops (which became the norm in cinema quality television shows with shocking speed).<p>The net effect of all this change is that negotiation power is moving from large integrated studio ventures to original content producers. Small production companies are less dependent on the capital advances, production infrastructure and marketing channels the big studios can offer.<p>Netflix definitely understands this, and also understands that the current Hollywood players fail to meet significant areas of demand. You see this in their choices of what productions they've funded directly like arrested development. It's a high risk venture, but it's not just a bluff or impossible. They are hiding in the blind spot of nearly all large market players: the unwillingness to abandon or cannibalize currently profitable activities because of changing market conditions.",1353822563

Suppose both get rid of health insurance, but Facebook is willing increase salary by $1000 - $2000 on average. WoW. So which one would you go now, Mr. Author? Facebook? Yeah. Because that $2000 is used to cover premium. On the other hands, Google doesn't raise my salary and I would have to take out $4000 total to cover my whole family.<p>The fact that your employer has someone to deal with the agent, does all billing and contacts for you makes your life easier as a worker. You don't have to scratch your heads trying to find the best agent out there. All the basic health plan covers the same. Some big companies will purchase expensive package because they want to attract more talent workers.<p>The amount your boss will save by canceling health package is a lot, but they won't increase your salary by $5000 - $10k. They just won't. Maybe $1000. You still have to pay for the rest yourself.<p>Getting breakfast, lunch and even dinner all by yourself is a lot of money. Big tech companies are known to offer free meals because they want to make sure their workers can get the most out of their work time AND at the same time getting the most out of their salary. Which company would offer more than 20% of salary raise by getting rid of employee benefits?<p>Another problem is showing caring. Even in a small bakery shop, the #1 benefit is they can purchase left over food at very low price. Some nice owners even let workers to take them home (I used to work for a bakery). My boss didn't pay me health insurance because it was a small shop, but I get to save my breakfast for my parents by getting free food every night! Many Chinese takeout hire workers from other states and they live in the same apartment. That's their benefit. That kind of convenient makes both employer and employees happy.<p>I hate to say but people should stop trying to make life as  a software.

Observe that RFC 3501 does not define a new version of the IMAP protocol. It's the same version. This is a revised document, which attempts to clarify and address numerous issues and inaccuracies in the original specification (some of which I noted publicly).</i><p><i>And, to make things even more interesting, as of this date there are already several reported errata to 3501. Furthermore, RFC 3501 actually changed the IMAP protocol, adding several new requirements, but it kept the IMAP4rev1 version. In other words: the protocol has changed, but it's still the same protocol, officially. Figure that one out.</i><p>Isn't updating version numbers when you change the protocol the most basic job of any standards organization? Is this really the sort of thing that we should be failing at?<p><i>If you still insist on using an inferior server, the result will be weird and will be, well, inferior ;P, but at least it will work.</i><p>All compliant client implementations have to be designed to deal with these ""inferior servers"" because they still exist. So client implementers cannot rely on usable persistent UIDs (if they want to be standards compliant, which is apparently very important to Crispin). And I'll note that you still haven't given me an explanation for why this feature exists in the spec at all: was the IMAP team really so shortsighted that they believed that no one would ever make a real IMAP server datastore?<p><i>that doesn't make it an accurate description of the state of affairs, nor certainly does it indicate anything about the design constraints of the protocol.</i><p>OK, what is inaccurate about it? And what are these mythical design constraints? Shouldn't they be written down somewhere?<p><i>the original IMAP protocol was highly asynchronous, and simply streamed protocol state to the client whenever things were updated so that the local client would have a live-updated display.</i><p>This seems insane to me. Live updates are all well and good, but why on Earth do we need live updates WHILE THE CLIENT HAS AN OUTSTANDING REQUEST?<p>Can you name other protocols that adopt this gloriously unstructured style?

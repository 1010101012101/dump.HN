635997,comment,635569,635831,0,0,roryokane,,,"Yes, there is at least one tool that does this. There is a Ruby on Rails plugin called Client-Side Validation. It generates client-side Javascript validation based on the existing validation in the model, which the server already checks against. You can find it here: <a href=""http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/client_side_validation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/client_side_validatio...</a>. I haven't tried it myself, so I can't vouch for how well it works. There also may be other, newer libraries for doing this out there.<p>I certainly agree that elimination of this repetition would be very helpful when developing websites. If the code can be generated automatically for you, there are very few situations where you wouldn't want client-side as well as server-side validation. (Some of those few situations might include expecting the user to have a computer too slow for Javascript or being unable to expose the validation method to the user for security reasons.)",1243861192

It interferes with implementing a fast implementation.<p>""It's a slow language,"" implies that there's something special about Ruby that precludes (relatively) fast implementation.  There's nothing special about Ruby like this.  Ruby is a very nice remix of language features that existed before.  Getting a language to be fast can require many iterations.  Ruby's syntax is a high barrier to entry to implementers, so fewer eyeballs have been looking at the problem.<p>Contrast this with Smalltalk.  \n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=619398"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=619398</a><p>Smalltalk was designed to be quickly implemented by a single programmer.  Implementing a ""Bluebook VM"" was treated as a rite of passage for support engineers for at least one of the vendors.  As a result, people have implemented many, many variations on Smalltalk.  (Including an VM with built-in OODB, another that can compile down to a C++ compatible DLL indistinguishable from one written in C++, another that ran on the <i>old</i> Palms, one with optional typing, and many others.)<p>I think it's fair to say that writing a Ruby VM is probably an order of magnitude harder.",1243861015

Actually, I think Google's image search is a result of them being on top for so long, it's been the same for years with little improvement. I mean, just look at Bing's.<p>3. Better video search. I love the hover-preview feature. I can see Google implementing it next year after some other mainstream sites implement it and it's no longer a ""Bing thing.""<p>4. Slightly cleaner interface. Let me show you: <a href=""http://r.im/1rf7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://r.im/1rf7</a> <a href=""http://r.im/1rf8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://r.im/1rf8</a>\nBing has a line-height of 130% which makes it a little more readable in my opinion. Sure it has more clutter in some areas, but the search results are cleaner and that's what matters to me when I'm scanning through them.<p>I don't use maps, travel, health, etc., so I can't comment on them, but so far I'm very pleased with the results. I didn't think Microsoft could pull it off and they did.",1243857821

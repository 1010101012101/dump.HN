8669284,comment,8668680,8668992,0,0,kazinator,,,"Summary: about a decade ago or so, Ertl ran into some regressions in GCC uncovered by benchmarking his Forth implementation, logged bugs for them, and they were fixed.<p>Some of them were in obscure GCC extensions, like notably computed goto. The compiler started generating code involving branches to a common instruction that does the actual indirect jump, instead of just doing that indirect jump.<p>It&#x27;s easy to understand how a performance regression affecting such a feature can slip through, if the behavior is otherwise correct.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that the GCC sky is falling, as all the trolling in that newsgroup would have you believe.",1417136393

8669235,comment,8668651,8668954,0,0,fafner,,,"I think the kqueue interface is a lot worse than the Linux way. With kqueue everything is forced through one interface. In Linux it&#x27;s just file descriptors and epoll to deal with them. It is a nice extension of the &quot;everything is a file&quot; mechanism and it embodies the &quot;do one thing and do it right&quot;.<p>This becomes apparent when you look at fs notifications. You&#x27;ve already mentioned how inotify is superior to kqueue. I mean seriously, the kqueue fs notifications are designed in such an incredibly bad way, it almost looks like a trolling attempt. E.g., when you try to watch a directory the kernel knows which files are manipulated. But the API has no way of telling you. The documentations usually suggest to keep a file list and update it. But this is complicated and racy and will certainly result in buggy behaviour.<p>And that really shows that having one interface do everything is a bad approach. The kqueue designers had to cover every event type that could happen. And thus they added an API for something they apparently didn&#x27;t understand properly. And since it&#x27;s stuck now in their API they would have to deprecate parts of it, if they ever have the interest in fixing it.<p>The inotify API is not perfect. But it does its job pretty well and it is the best fs notification API I have seen. fanotify solves a different use case. And that&#x27;s really the flexibility that the Linux interface has. They can easily come up with new event APIs for new use cases because all they have to do is provide a file descriptor.<p>I wish the BSD folks would simply implement inotify. But it seems they are unwilling to fix their API and if they did then they&#x27;d probably design their own interface simply out of spite. Right now their crappy fs notification interface is a real pain. And since the lowest common denominator is very influential when it comes to portability libraries like glib, Qt, etc. everybody is suffering because of BSD. And they only get away with it because OSX has the same API. I haven&#x27;t looked at FSEvents. Is it a new API or simply based on kqueue?<p></rant>",1417134720

If\nthe partner likes what they see, then more\ncommunications are reasonably likely.<p>For a little more, since most VC firms do publish\ntheir phone numbers on their Web sites, can call\nand, give name, say are an entrepreneur, and ask for\n&quot;office of&quot; a VC partner are interested in.  Then\nmay get a person, often a really sweet, young woman,\nand explain a little of the work and ask how can\nsend e-mail.  Often can send e-mail to the woman.\nAlso, often, if call the VC firm after closing hours\ncan leave a message on the phone of the VC partner.<p>Should, of course, check the interests of the VC\npartner to see if those interests do cover the\nproject.  And likely should pick a VC partner\nwithout very many current investments or board\nseats.<p>For a little more, once the results of a project\nhave obtained some publicity and traction, VC\npartners may notice and call the entrepreneur.<p>The key in all this is just (1) above, that is, have\nthe project that far along.<p>But, more generally, for such contacting a VC\npartner, my view is that an entrepreneur with a\nproject about to get users/customers should try hard\nnot to accept equity funding and, instead, just\ncontinue to own 100% of the business.

The main reason is that VCs just\nwill not fund the work before there is a\nproduct/service ready to &quot;play with&quot;.  Much of the\nreason here is that VCs can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t evaluate plans\nfor such work, and likely the main reason here is\nthat they do not believe that such evaluations could\nbe at all accurate in predicting financial success.<p>So, essentially all the work in IT the VCs see is\nwhat could be done by 1-3 guys in a garage before\nequity funding, and this situation is for high RoI\njust devastating.  Moreover, about all the VCs can\ndo when evaluating such projects is to look just\nsuperficially, at only the cover and not really the\nbook, and the superficial look hurts evaluation\naccuracy and, thus, average RoI.<p>Part of the extreme tragedy of this situation is\nthat quite broadly in our applications of the fields\nof science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\n(STEM), we know quite well, thank you, how to plan\nprojects, present the plans just on paper, and\nevaluate the projects, just from the paper, with\nhigh accuracy, much higher than that of IT VC.  Or,\nwe can do such evaluations for the largest engine,\nship, or airplane ever built, the tallest building\nor dam ever built, the longest bridge, tunnel,\ncanal, or pipeline ever built, etc.  Heck, the\nancient Egyptians planned the pyramids, and we don&#x27;t\nsee a lot of evidence of a lot of partially\ncompleted, failed pyramid projects.<p>Here&#x27;s an outline of something IT VCs could do that\nhuge evidence from history clearly shows would yield\nmuch higher Roi; the outline is in steps (a)-(d):<p>(a) Problem.<p>Pick a good problem, one where the first good or a\nmuch better solution will be a <i>must have</i>, not just\na <i>nice to have</i> for many users/customers, so that\nin total, from number of users/customers and revenue\nper each, can build a business worth $1+ billion.<p>Here is an example of such a problem:  Find a safe,\neffective, cheap one pill cure for any cancer.<p>For this <i>must have</i>, there should be very little\ndoubt; if there is much doubt, then pick another\nproblem.  In particular, we do not want to struggle\nover <i>product-market fit</i>.<p>(b) Solution.<p>For the needed solution, do some STEM research.\nWe&#x27;re talking real research here, of quality that\nwould qualify as a Ph.D. dissertation in a good\nresearch university, a paper in a good journal,\nmaybe a grant from NSF, DARPA, etc.  Yes, there is\ntraining for such research, the Ph.D. degree.\nRight, mostly here we&#x27;re talking a good research\nuniversity STEM field Ph.D. prerequisite.<p>With the research, want to create some <i>proprietary\nintellectual property</i>, <i>secret sauce</i>, STEM\ntechnology difficult to duplicate or equal, that is\nthe crucial, core of the solution and the business\nand, for competitors, a severe barrier to entry.\nProtect the work as a trade secret (with\ncorresponding software securely locked up inside a\nserver farm) or patents.<p>For this solution, there should be very little doubt\nthat it is the first good or a much better solution\nto the problem.  If can&#x27;t find such a solution, then\nreturn to (a) and pick another problem.<p>It should be possible to give a quite accurate\nevaluation of the solution and, thus, the project\nfrom the research for the solution presented just on\npaper.<p>(c) Software.<p>Since we&#x27;re considering IT, with Moore&#x27;s law, etc.,\nto provide the product/service to users/customers,\nwrite the software for servers and user devices.\nGiven the solution, the software should be routine.<p>(d) Launch.<p>Now we are sure we have the first good or a much\nbetter solution for a problem where such a solution\nis a must have.<p>Get publicity, users/customers, revenue, earnings,\nand a company worth $1+ billion.<p>For (a)-(c) here, there are some great examples from\nmedicine and US national security.<p>For the second, there was the SR-71:  The problem\nwas to do surveillance of the USSR.  The intended\nsolution was an airplane that could fly at 80,000+\nfeet, at 3.0+ Mach, for 2000+ miles without\nrefueling.  Kelly Johnson of the Lockheed Skunk\nWorks showed up with an armload of papers showing\nthe plan for the solution.  The project was\napproved, and for years the SR-71s flew as designed.<p>Another example was Keyhole, basically a Hubble but\nbefore Hubble and aimed at the surface of the earth.\nAnother example was GPS.<p>Technology?  Nearly beyond belief.  Value?  World\nchanging.  Batting average?  Very high, much higher\nthan VC.<p>Gee, if the US DoD had wanted to sell the results of\nHubble or GPS, wonder if they could have gotten any\nrevenue?  Are we talking <i>must have</i> here?  How\n&#x27;bout that?<p>Of course, the work in (b) and (c) needs accurate\nevaluation, but the US is just awash in people that\ncan do that in the best research universities, via\neditors of appropriate peer-reviewed journals, via\nproblem sponsors in NSF and DARPA, etc.<p>After (a) and (b), it really is possible to know\nwith quite high accuracy VC firms should look to\nfund projects just after success with these two\nsteps.<p>That&#x27;s how to do (a)-(c) of projects.  To be sure\nthe launch in (d) works, do the work as outlined in\n(a)-(c).",1417134597

There isn&#x27;t really any reason to. They could extend the SxS system to support multiple versions of core DLLs in different namespaces but I doubt that will actually happen.<p>The reason I doubt it will happen is that the hype around containers has nothing to do with lift and shift of legacy applications, but rather what new applications and platforms are possible with more efficient isolation and portability of runtime + application.<p>I would expect their efforts to be directed towards .NET, making it easy to package and application, the Global Assembly Cache and any native libraries it needs. Sure you could run any arbitrary application and there would but support for that but it&#x27;s clear where their priorities lie.<p>PS: It&#x27;s worth mentioning that Windows already has network namepaces support. It was implemented to support the virtual network gateways for VMM&#x27;s NVGRE.

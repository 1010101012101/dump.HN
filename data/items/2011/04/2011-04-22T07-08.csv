(e.g. it usually takes a day or so for a new customer to get  set up.)<p>I'm actually working on a cheap low-performance storage service designed for backups (webdav and zfs snapshot accessible.  I'm targeting 1/10th the price of s3 before bulk discounts, but I also am also targeting a lower level of redundancy and performance.)  but I thought the primary demand would be people on other services or on their own servers wanting a backup, so it's interesting to hear if other people place a much higher priority on ease of setting up backups.",1303458992

Unless you're going to run each engine against a weighted distribution of operating systems (as relevant to your existing client base), on a weighted distribution of hardware architectures (ditto), using your application's library (weighted for real world use, like your clients do) - you're not going to see anything actually applicable. They're still going to be using the browser they use. The only applicable take away is 'module/class/function $x is performing badly in case $y on $environment/configuration $z and we should fix it'.<p>I'm assuming the use case of desktop, browser usage here, and not server usage.

5561222,comment,5559937,5561025,5,0,rayiner,,,"New York does a lot for people living on under $20k/year. That's why those people live in New York--because of the very generous public services. The NYCHA houses 400,000 people in 180,000 apartments. The Section 8 program assists another 620,000 people, and accounts for 8% of the city's rental apartments. The average family has a median income of $22k/year.<p>The city's public housing projects aren't the nicest in the world, but that's endemic to any such project. The actual facilities aren't bad. They are comparable to the apartments my (upper middle class) family in Bangladesh live in (which was to me a stark illustration of the 'top 5% of Indians live like the bottom 5% of Americans' phenomenon).",1366149589

5561219,comment,5559281,5560736,4,0,nhaehnle,,,"<i>> The members of the Eurozone taken together have the same sovereignty over monetary policy as any other country. But that's beside the point.</i><p>You are right of course, but they can't get their shit together.<p><i>> The point is that a sovereign country with a central bank can print its own money, but that doesn't mean it can borrow in its own currency.</i><p>This is getting into a bit wonky details, but the bottom line is that your concerns are misplaced. First of all, a monetarily sovereign government doesn't <i>have</i> to borrow in the first place. The only reason that they ""borrow"" is to provide a safe interest earning asset for the financial sector to play with, and so that the central bank can effectively raise the interest rate without paying interest itself - and wouldn't that cause interesting questions by the public, if suddenly raising interest rates would cost the central bank money!<p>Second, at the end of the day when the government runs a deficit, banks have a choice between keeping surplus reserves at the central bank or buying government bonds. As long as the interest rate paid on government bonds is higher than that on reserves, banks will buy government bonds.<p>So there are <i>no</i> monetary constraints.<p>What you <i>should</i> be concerned about, if anything at all, is the exchange rate to <i>other</i> currencies. Clearly, most normal countries see their exchange rate fall if they run a current account deficit for too long (the US is an interesting but explainable exception to that rule).<p>This makes imports more expensive. On the other hand, it makes your exports cheaper for foreigners, which is a boost for domestic industry. So in the end, the economy actually <i>benefits</i>.",1366149573

If you take a conductor, even though for short distances the material it has negligible resistance, it comes out to be a limiting factor for long lengths (thousands of kilometres).<p>If you look at Joule's first law, which says that the heat produced by a piece of wire is proportional to the square of the current times the electrical resistance of the wire (ie. I^2*R), you'll notice it doesn't say anything about voltage. This is why power transmission lines for long distances usually have high voltages (~100kV) or even higher ones(the transmission lines where I live are 735kV). Unfortunately, there is a limit as to how much voltage that can be put, due to other problems caused by the high voltage itself (coronal discharge, arcing, etc.).<p>This is why electricity (per kilowatt, retail) costs me one third of what it costs my friend in Los Angeles; it's not technically feasible to send our low cost electricity all the way to there while still turning a profit. Note that this completely changes if there is high temperature[1] superconductivity, but at this point, it's not exactly doable[2].<p>[1] High temperature, in this case, essentially means without liquid nitrogen and other relatively exotic cooling methods. Your living room would be considered high temperature, for example.\n[2] The current superconductor with the highest transition temperature is HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8, at 133K (-140C).",1366149341

5561161,comment,5559281,5560734,6,0,nhaehnle,,,"I am sure that it was not your intention, but please do not spread misinformation about the concept of natural rate of unemployment.<p>You are right that there will always be some unemployed as people need to find the next job after a surprising layoff. However, this is known as <i>frictional</i> unemployment, and can basically not be more than 2%. In practice, you'd expect it to be well below 1% in an otherwise well-functioning labor market, though I will admit that it depends on the exact institutions and laws surrounding labor.<p>What economists mean when they say ""natural"" unemployment is something else entirely. It refers to the (contested) idea that there is some ""natural"" rate of unemployment that the economy ""wants"" to achieve, in the sense that you will supposedly see some unintended negative side-effects if you use policy (such as classical demand policies) to push unemployment below that level. This unintended negative side-effect is typically said to be inflation.<p>There is some truth to this idea; the criticism is mostly in how one responds to it. There is truth to this idea because low unemployment increases the wage bargaining power of labor, which may result in higher inflation via the wage-price cycle.<p>However, the standard reaction to this is disappointing: Central banks purposefully generate unemployment to keep inflation low, making unemployment a macro-level problem, while the rest of policy (and public opinion) acts as if unemployment were the fault of the individual. This is clearly schizophrenic behavior.<p>The more intelligent response is to say that infinite demand for labor should be created <i>at a fixed wage</i>. This eliminates unemployment without enabling the wage-price cycle. This idea isn't exactly new, but it is not yet widely known, even though its supporters come from a surprisingly wide range of the political spectrum (the supporters disagree on the <i>how</i> of the implementation details; the main search keyword is ""Job Guarantee"", though I have also seen some superficially quite different proposals such as this one: <a href=""http://www.morganwarstler.com/post/44789487956/guaranteed-income-auction-the-unemployed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.morganwarstler.com/post/44789487956/guaranteed-in...</a>).<p>Why is it not widely known? I believe it is a combination of (a) efforts to make this idea known outside of small academic circles are relatively recent, and (b) while individuals clearly benefit, there are no truly powerful individuals or social institutions that clearly benefit, hence the advocacy is not as well-organized as e.g. Austrian propaganda.",1366149134

Then it has nothing to do with it.<p>This is becoming pure wordplay now. Sure, if you take the vague phrase ""something to do with"" and redefine it more specifically as ""provides tangible benefits to"", then you'd be right. But who gives you the authority to redefine it so? PG made the relation clear in his tweet: ""When terrible things happen to people I can't help, I ... help people I can."" In other words, he uses tragedies as a reminder to donate to the less fortunate.<p>Seems pretty simple to me.<p>As for the rest of your post, it seems that your argument rests on the belief that PG's tweet didn't cause anyone to donate. If so, your argument fails, because some people <i>did</i> donate as a result of PG's tweet (or at least claimed to).<p>But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that, instead, your argument rests on the belief that getting a few people to donate is not worth causing offense to others. In that case, I would denounce your argument is immature, selfish, and immoral. I would gladly give offense to 10 or 20 people (and tell them to get over themselves) if it caused 1 person to donate to Watsi.<p>Lastly, you haven't provided any evidence why people <i>should</i> be offended. I completely disagree that anything PG did was crass, insensitive, or tasteless. Au contraire, I think you are the one mistaken for interpreting it that way. You've misappropriated an arbitrary societal rule for reasons you likely cannot defend.",1366149091

If you redirect to null it will use up all your memory and swap space in a few minutes:<p>./main > /dev/null<p>In most other languages this same code would run for a short time and then abort after exhausting the stack.  This is the best behavior since algorithms that use unbounded memory are where you certainly must handle out of memory errors and set limits; using too much stack space is an error that should be caught quickly not postponed.  Go on the other hand uses a growable stack, so the code you gave will use up all available memory and swap before finally crashing.<p>Go uses a growable stack so that programs can use many goroutines on 32-bit machines.  This is bad for performance due to extra checks on calling function to see if the stack needs to be grown or shrunk, the overhead to actually do that, and less efficient use of cpu data cache.  It makes it complicated to call functions from any other language.  It seems like any modern language should work best on 64-bit and make trade-offs for 32-bit, not the other way.",1366149040

It's not the ""Victorian"" working conditions, which is hardly the case in a modern factory like Foxconn runs, but resources.<p>If you want 5,000 skilled workers to assemble a new product that's shipping in three weeks, in the manufacturing districts of China and Taiwan you can snap your fingers and get them by the end of the day. In the US and Europe this would take weeks, if not months. There's no on-demand talent pool like this. It doesn't exist.<p>On top of that, if you want something made, nearly anything, you can get it sourced immediately. You want magnets for your new iPad? There's a factory down the road from Foxconn that makes billions of them. You want batteries? Specialized rubber pads? A particular adhesive? A solvent? A new type of display panel? It's all being made right there, and probably just miles away. It could be on a truck to your factory within the day. No customs. No duty. No logistics other than picking up a phone.<p>Don't forget Apple's original Macintosh computers were made in a state-of-the-art plant in California, but the scale of overseas manufacturers, who were making everything from toothbrushes to televisions, made it very difficult to keep competitive. It's not necessarily the wages of the workers, or their thrifty working conditions. It's the entire ecosystem.<p>Despite all this, Mac manufacturing <i>is</i> returning to the US: (<a href=""http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/08/apple-mac-pro-made-in-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/12/08/apple-mac-pro-made-in...</a>) Details aren't clear at this point, but it seems Apple's partnering with Foxconn to open up domestic manufacturing for selected products. This will probably make the supply chain a lot more complicated, but for something like the Mac Pro, which is low volume, high margin, and on a much more relaxed update cycle, it wouldn't be impossible. Same goes for other products like the Mac Mini.<p>Let's not forget how horrible Victorian working conditions were. People in those times would find working at Foxconn to be like living in a palace. Flush toilets? Showers? Beds with mattresses? Company provided health care? A hard limit on over-time? No beatings? Foxconn's wages are well above the norm in that industry, even if thrifty by American standards.",1366148514

Since the ear hears words in sequence, the interpretation of those words also occurs in sequence.<p>3. Thus the phrase great green dragon is interpreted first as great _, then as great green _, and then finally as great green dragon, with the hole _ representing the expectation of something concrete to come, something that the minds eye can eventually see.<p>4. This expectation is satisfied only when each new word reduces the possibilities for what will fill the hole. With each new word, the hole must shrink toward a single point, and rapidly.<p>5. Therefore, the most-pleasing ordering of <i>N</i> modifiers will tend to be the one that most rapidly and evenly converges to a point.<p>6. Therefore, we can find the most-pleasing ordering by maximizing the geometric mean of the shrinkages for all steps in the sequence.<p>6. For fixed <i>N</i>, the geometric mean and the product are interchangeable for optimization purposes, so we can just maximize the product of the shinkages.<p>And thats pretty much it.<p>Now to your questions:<p>By impotent I mean without effect. Any word that you put after a word that has already reduced the hole to a near-point is going to seem worthless and spoil the whole sequence.<p>Re. begging the question, a sequence isnt effective because its effective; its effective because, <i>given our mental probability models for word sequences</i>, it rapidly and evenly converges upon a concrete interpretation.<p>To take your darkest/greatest as an example, heres the rapid-and-even-convergence scores for the two possible orderings:<p><pre><code>    $ { echo darkest greatest;\n        echo greatest darkest; } | ./modorder.py\n            170047264509 darkest greatest\n           3409987166088 greatest darkest\n</code></pre>\nSo, without any knowledge that horse will follow, we can predict that greatest darkest will be the best ordering of the modifiers.<p>(This is from a crude approximation of the model that I just whipped up.

Vancouver Police (VPD) where initially overwhelmed with tips and digital media, so VPD setup a website [3] to aggregate the data and identify suspects. ICBC (Vancouver BC's provincial entity that issues drivers licenses) offered facial recognition software [4] and their database (although I think this idea was scrapped due to privacy issues). An organization called LEVA helped investigators analyze 1,600 hours of video evidence [5]. The VPD riot website [3] puts the hours of video evidence at 5,000 [6]. VPD used <i>a team of 40 LEVA forensic video analysts and technicians from across the United States, Canada, and the U.K. was assemble for an intense two-week period to review the evidence.</i> [5]<p>So, I think these people will step up and help if the government has not already developed this capability. Wired states that ""Data for the Boston Marathon Investigation Will Be Crowdsourced"" [7]. This process is likely already underway.<p>p.s. since I mentioned the vancouver stanley cup riot, I should also mention the vigilante justice that followed [8]. Obviously these two instances are much different but I think it is worth mentioning.

What a lot of us ARE arguing is that as long as we have an aggregate demand shortfall (everyone in the economy trying to save at once), paying attention to the debt is exactly the wrong thing to do, since the government is the only actor in the economy that has the freedom to act counter-cyclically and make up for the shortfall in private sector demand. The ultimate goal is to start a virtuous cycle of spending that gets us back toward full employment (and increases GDP). Then and only then does it make sense for the government to try to reduce debt through cuts.<p>There's decent evidence (see Delong & Summers 2012: <a href=""http://delong.typepad.com/20120320-conference-draft-final-candidate-delong-summers-brookings-fiscal-policy-in-a-depressed-economy-1.32.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delong.typepad.com/20120320-conference-draft-final-ca...</a>) that trying to reduce debt through cuts in an economy like we have right now is counter-productive even on it's own terms (reducing the debt-gdb ratio) because any cuts you make further reduce aggregate demand and thus reduce the GDB side of that ratio even further.<p>It's not a democrat in the white house vs. republican in the white house thing that is causing people who were complaining about deficits under GWB to advocate against cutting short term spending now.

At my last startup, as I explain in the linked talk above, we used Lean Startup techniques to kill a number of ideas that we would otherwise have implemented. The startup still didn't make it, so you could call it a failure, but the customer development and iterative market-testing techniques gave us many more tries for the same money, so I am very happy we used them.<p>But if you want a more traditional success story, I'd suggest Boxbee:<p><a href=""https://boxbee.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://boxbee.com/</a><p>I was a mentor at a Lean Startup Machine event ~18 months ago where I met the founder. He had a very hazy idea, and over the course of the weekend refined it into something more focused. He then used the Lean Startup techniques to build a business that had revenue from the first month, and was quickly in the black. Relentlessly refining both the user experience and the back end, he found product-market fit and came up with a sustainable plan. And he did this all in his spare time, mainly with his own money.<p>A month or so ago he pitched it at Jason Calcanis's LAUNCH conference and took first place. Now he's raising money to build an infrastructure well beyond the initial MVP-grade product.<p>But you can also look at historical examples. It's important to note that none of the Lean Startup techniques are new. It's meant to be a crystallization of things that some people were doing before, but that had never really been talked about. At the local Lean Startup Circle event, we had the founders of Dropbox and Cafe Press talk about how they worked, and it was very much in the start-small-and-iterate-relentlessly style that the Lean Startup folks are promoting.",1366147619

So you can never quite say that in the absence of the debt spending, the multiplier effect wouldn't have happened.<p>Anti-keynesians (hayekians?) point this out regularly and like to say that the burden of proof is on the keynesians, which will of course be impossible for the keynesians to ever prove.  So that's where they get their handhold on arguing against keynesian theory.  (Note I'm only a hobbyist with this stuff so my explanations may be way off - this is just my own sense of it.)<p>Now, there's something to be said for sometimes accepting something that is not potentially provably false.  I think Darwinian evolution is an example of something that is not a strictly technical theory, but there's been such a body of experimentation over the years that you pretty much have to accept it as fact anyway.<p>And there's work done in modern Causality about how to tease out causality from correlation in the absence of counterfactuals.

To be fair, I should note that they did brand the Linux VMs as ""preview"" (which is just another word for beta). Even though they were already charging for the product, they didn't guarantee an up-time SLA either so we were well-aware it would be a risk using the product.<p>The biggest issue by far? Random VM Reboots<p>We thought our applications or some particular package was causing our VMs to randomly reboot. After thorough investigating, we found out that our code was perfectly fine. The folks on the Azure team were rebooting our VMs for internal upgrades. They oddly were doing this without any advance notice. This would affect our application servers, database servers, and even our development/staging instances. Another frustrating aspect was the fact that they would often do these upgrades during peak traffic hours (9 AM - 5 PM Pacific Time).<p>Without a better solution, we just wrote some code to ensure that our application supervisor would auto-start if the system were to reboot which helps mitigate the problem. Hopefully these issues no longer occur now that they offer an 99.95% SLA.<p>As for your other question, my start-up is Pepperdeck <a href=""https://pepperdeck.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pepperdeck.com/</a>",1366146631

You create MVPs to learn fast so you can iterate faster.. but since you're still trying to validate your hypothesis, it's hard to decide what is really <i>minimal</i> or <i>valuable</i>.<p>I guess MVPs is an over-used word.. I prefer prototype: <i>A first or preliminary model of something, esp. a machine, from which other forms are developed or copied.</i> Basically, you <i>use</i> prototypes to iterate really fast and test your assumptions, and <i>then</i>, you build a mvp from what you've learned.<p>I prefer prototype because it's clear on both side that it's not the real product. It's a temporary phase to test the ideas. But again.. way easier to say than to do. I'm currently in that ""prototype vs MVPs"" phase and I'm struggling on determining the best next step.

If so, then accepting jurisdiction would be redundant, since the Supreme Court is perfectly competent to adjudicate disputes under ""international law."" If not, that would arguably be a separation of powers violation: Congress signing us up to accept the superior jurisdiction of a foreign court whose judgments couldn't be reviewed by what is supposed to be the court of last resort: the Supreme Court.",1366146079

Bush's no-veto policy and ballooning of the debt.  Now that ""their guy"" is in the WhiteHouse, they no longer agree that it's irresponsible to set the deficit meter on 11 and walk away like we have been.<p>Can't we all agree that this guy was totally correct? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kuTG19Cu_Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kuTG19Cu_Q</a><p>I guess I wouldn't be so against some amount of debt if it looked like we had it under control.  It's funny that we're dissecting the results of a study on what 90% debt:GDP would do.  Well that was back in 2010, we've blown way past 90%.  We're at 107% as of 2012 and climbing.<p>It's not just about the debt's exact impact at a certain percentage.  If it were just that, we could debate it and fine tune it.  It's about our Government's complete inability to get it under control.<p>Maybe 90% Debt:GDP won't hurt too badly, but sooner or later as it rises, it will crater even our economy.",1366146068

It's also highly regulated and extremely capital intensive, making it further unattractive to compete with the incumbents. On top of that, you have to get space at airports which, if it's full, you just can't do. My understanding is that most airports in major US centers are ""full"" during peak times (morning and evening rush hours). Some major international ones (LAX, JFK) are probably full most of the time.<p>All in all, it's a tough industry. That said, you get a few new entrants every decade. Frontier ('94), Jetblue ('2001?), Virgin America (2007).<p>I'm sure one of them has tried being nicer to customers, but next time those customers went to buy a ticket they bought one on AA cause it was $10 cheaper or left 30 min later.",1366146038

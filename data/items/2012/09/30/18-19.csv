The way I see it, NFC is a way to enable short range communication with physical objects in the real world that are NFC enabled as well. I speculate that a NFC mobile device can be used as your key to open NFC enabled secure locations and objects (e.g. car keys, office keys, house keys, safe locks). Another usage I speculate is with pet's and pet tags. If a pet is lost you could scan the pet or a tag and it will tell an individual who own's the pet and the pets name.",1349031531

4593693,comment,4593205,4593432,7,0,omegant,,,"Commercial pilot with small experience with gliders here. I can not be sure, as I lack the scientific background, but I think this study is missing the important contribution of waves in the way albatrosses gain energy from the wind. \nIf you watch videos of sea birds, youll see that they try to fly close to cliffs or wave crests, that way they take advantage of the  upward currents generated.\nWhen albatrosses turn windward Ill bet something that they are aiming for the upward current created by a big wave. I dont think they can do something like this with weak winds or no sea to take advantage.\nGliders and paragliders routinely use upward currents to stay for hours in the air(altitudes 50.000, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlan_Project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlan_Project</a>). This currents can be generated by mountains or by the air heated close to the ground that climbs as a bubble (and tops as a typical summer cotton cloud or in a Super thunderstorm..).\nSmall ascending currents are even able to stop the descend of a 60Ton commercial airplane while crossing them. But are to thin (a 100 yards in diameter or less for small clouds) to be usable by fast and heavy jets.<p>Maybe they are not suitable for commercial flights but could be used for small drone fleets loaded of scientific  instruments. They would only need a small electrical motor(for those moments with out wind), solar panels and enough battery  to fly the way Albatrosses do, and of course the AI to maneuver.<p>edit: After reading some comments and the study again, I see that I missed the point. I realize that its possible for a small ""plane"" to use the wind gradient to soar.\n With commercial planes you dont look for it, but you have to avoid it!, if you are flying at your approach speed (lets say 140 kts) with 20 kts head wind and you suddenly find wind shear of 20 kts tail wind, youll find yourself with some 40 kts less of speed and fully into stall. The opposite is used (as I understand) by the albatrosses to win total energy.\nIs still not usable for larger planes as wind gradient is thin and very close to the ground.\nStrong jet streams are used every day by commercial flights to cross oceans. The routes are changed along the winds. For example USA to Europe flights will flight with the jet stream(and save more than an hour of flight time), and Europe to USA flights will avoid it. All routes are based on the weather reports and previsions.<p>I really would like to hear Elon Musk take on electric planes. He claims he has some calculations on electrical high altitude planes, that would be awesome and ground braking.",1349031396

4593679,comment,4593296,4593296,86,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"I worked in finance (as a trader). And I left. But I loved it. Most people didn't, but I did; I found the history and the <i>mission</i> captivating and I was not shy about showing that passion.<p>I left because they fired my charismatic manager and the firm's culture grew neurotic as the scandals and random terminations piled on. I saw the over-worked, sociopathic, misanthropic archetypes. But I saw the same personalities in Silicon Valley.<p>The capital markets are a critical piece of our modern world. We're still figuring out how these fascinatingly complicated machines work - they act differently in different cultures, in different sentiments, and under different geopolitical constraints. When they work...it's magical. The philosophical dimension of a weighted democracy doing better what kings and emperors through antiquity failed to do is a powerfully individualist statement. And there is <i>so much more</i> that has to be done. There are literally not enough hours in a lifetime of lifetimes to see all the implications and interactions and human potential waiting to be unlocked.<p>Do I sound like a crackhead? Probably. But I love the idea of taking what is not understood, considered ""random"" or ""exogenous"", and building something to bring it from the unknown to the known. I understand the historical struggle these resource allocation machines (how I think of them) have faced and why we need people to carry the flag, even if it means being hated and misunderstood by the public.<p>A lot of people go into finance for the wrong reasons. I feel sorry for them. A lot of them are held there by a fear, not of losing the cash flow, but of losing the prestige or business card. These people need help, not derision. But concluding the entire industry is corrupt is like looking at JustFabulous and a handful of overworked founders and concluding Silicon Valley a blight on humanity.<p>P.S. I don't expect a huge salary just for working at a bank. But if I'm coming up with original ideas, I will do the calculation of what I could earn if I went out on my own, and if the bank figure doesn't line up with that figure (it didn't) it makes sense to arbitrage. This is classic entrepreneurship and there is nothing more sinister about JPMorgan having to compete with a star player launching their own fund than there is Google having to pay out to top performers who may otherwise do well launching a start-up.",1349031142

The program took a basic description of the part to be milled and converted it into tool movement steps. this was all 2d but the parts were quite complicated as were the calculations. Tool movements is what killed it. We started with a list of lists structure but that took up too much ram so we moved to a skip list implementation. That also took too much ram so it was back to a singly linked list and an external preprocessor. So it turned from an elegant tool into a few chunks of ugly which had to be chained. That really doesn't work well on DOS. This was before EMS etc so 640k of segmented vomit it was. It was moved to a dedicated 68k SBC eventually with the ui in turbo pascal (over a serial line) which worked well and we could throw 4mb at it and write the control program in c using a cross compiler on unix (plus no segments=bliss).<p>I love 32+ bits these days :)",1349030977

But as is typical in cases like this, the content producers moved for a preliminary injunction to shut Aereo down while the case runs. The trial court refused, and so the content producers appealed.<p>Ralph Oman, who stopped working for the government before the dawn of the commercial Internet, filed an amicus in the content industry's appeals request to impose an injunction on Aereo.<p>Techdirt read Oman's amicus and reported sentences in the brief taken out of context. Techdirt's reading of Oman's amicus doesn't even make sense; the courts dealing with this case have no ability to create a ""guilty until proven innocent"" standard, nor can they require that technology produces consult Congress before launching products.<p>Oman was making an inside baseball argument to the court hearing the case. One element that recurs in all complex policy cases: how do judges resolve the (often contrary) forces of precedent, Constitutional principle, and the statutes enacted by legislatures. What Oman is arguing is not that the judge should apply some new restrictive rule on technology; rather, he's arguing that should the judge refuse an injunction on such a clear-cut case (his sentiment, not mine), that judge would in effect be creating a new policy of exempting technology companies from vicarious liability out of whole cloth, ignoring both precedent (thus his citation to a case where copy shop owners had been held liable for misuse of their property) and statute.<p>Obviously, Oman is a copyright hawk. I'm ""conservative"" as copyright goes, and even I don't think Oman is making a strong argument. This is obviously a very ""leftist"" forum, but that doesn't free you to make up entirely new and ridiculous arguments and stuff them into some random guy's mouth to create a straw man.<p>Finally, as straw men go, this is a pretty feeble one. This guy doesn't matter at all. He stopped managing copyright policy before the advent of CU-SeeMe.",1349030634

4593596,comment,4592957,4593368,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"Not really. We have a common law system in the US, which is presumed to be flexible. If you want the kind of legal system where nothing exists unless it's spelled out, then you'd be happier living under a civil law system, such as that found in , say, France, or in most Latin American countries. In a common law system, you shouldn't necessarily need to rewrite the law for every new thing that comes down the pipe; in other words, just because you have a new technical way of sharing content, you're not exempted from the moral obligation not to do so without permission (as spelled out in existing law).<p>Now most objections to the copyright regime, including my own, are with the spirit of the law. I don't think it's right that copyright protection should extend to a work for an entire lifetime after the death of the author, or for longer than the typical human lifespan. Nor do I think it should be extendable retroactively. I'd prefer to see copyright terms similar to patent ones, of 20 or 30 years. That requires making pretty low-level changes in the law, which is a difficult and tedious process involving a great deal of opposition - which sucks. On the other hand, I don't think it'as acceptable to a) infringe freely because you think it's the morally superior course - whether you agree or not, people who choose to rely on the law as it is currently written to manage their assets are entitled to do so, or b) try to circumvent the spirit of the law by reaching for ever-more obscure technicalities - 'the law doesn't explicitly prohibit laser-light transmission through water, so if I spray my DVDs before ripping them I'm not breaking the law!'<p>Of course, this makes for a more restrictive world in the legal sense, because it's not that easy to get laws changed when there are powerful economic interests aligned against one. However, subversion of the law by technical means is basically trickery, and my experience is that that either leads to harsher laws or ends in absurdities. We've seen what happens with harsher laws - because of indifference and intransigence on the part of the internet community, we've ended up with monstrosities such as the DMCA, with its wildly excessive <i>penalties</i> for sharing media, which are designed to offset the low <i>probability</i> of enforcement (employing an economic concept known as an <i>indifference curve</i>, which has a sound theoretical foundation but depends on people being rational utility maximizers...which they're not, most of the time). As for absurdity, you get things like <i>eruv</i>s, in which Jewish Rabbis get around ancient religious prohibitions on activity during the Sabbath by redefining the entire local neighborhood as a single dwelling place, which involves setting up a corporation to own a loaf of bread and paying people to walk around once a week to ensure that all bridges and other infrastructure are still standing (see <a href=""http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28452/wire-to-wire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/28452/wire-to-wire/</a> for a full explanation).<p>If we want to really remedy the copyright situation, the best way forward is not to invent ever more obscure and devious ways to transmit files, but to automate and smooth the process of granting and administering copyrights. There is no reason that a copyright holder cannot waive some rights voluntarily, which includes partial waiver: I could paint a picture and specify that it is copyrighted until today's date in 2017, at which point it enters the public domain, say, or offer any number of creative licensing terms. The problem is licensing is that it's tedious to read and administer unless you're a lawyer, which is why the Creative Commons thing has taken off so well. Now if we automate that, there's no reason that we couldn't see shortened copyright terms emerge voluntarily as market equilibria; the law would still offer long copyright terms by default, but in a world of automated licensing such maximal terms would correspond to an excessively high price, and demand would flow towards competing products with more favorable terms. If this can be demonstrated to yield more lawful economic activity than copyright maximalism, then it's more likely to be formalized in law and provide copyright licensees with more rights than they currently enjoy.",1349029816

4593561,comment,4591846,4591846,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is an excellent post. I'm now excited about learning OTP. I've seen so many code-quality problems, some of which have destroyed companies, that I'd really love to see if there's a way to solve this problem. ""No silver bullet"" seems to be the going attitude. Code sucks, it always turns to garbage, and no one reads the shit anymore (that's why we have IDEs! Wheee!) I really want to disagree with this. Readable code shouldn't be a rarity.<p>Apologies in advance for what's going to seem like self-promotion. Many of my opinions I've already plopped onto the internet in my blog so I'm going to be doing a lot of blog linking.<p>Maintenance has a nasty paradox. To do it right, you need political power. You need to be able to say, ""I am fixing this and that's that and any problems it causes for you are your problem."" The level of political clout you need to do maintenance decently is manager-level. You need help from a lot of people and if you don't have the ability to force them to prioritizing helping you in this gnarly task, they probably won't. (Feature freeze? I need a Bob-ruling before I do that.) In most companies, maintenance is not rewarded, and it's not fun, so people with manager-level clout generally avoid such work. (<a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/taxation-without-representation-why-code-maintenance-fails-and-how-to-fix-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2011/09/23/taxation-with...</a>) The politically enabled people tend to take the ""shiny new"" work (and since no one has the clout to oppose them on anything material, they often made bad decisions and produce shoddy results) and the underclasses end up maintaining the garbage after they launch, get promoted, and flee the system. So maintenance ends up being a workball that gets dropped on people who don't have the power to do it right, don't have the expertise to know how to do it, and don't have any good reason to care.<p>People underestimate complexity density and how much it can vary, and also how high it can be in source code. How long does it take to read ""a book""? Well, it's between 2 and 400 hours for me, depending on the material. 10,000 lines of code is a book. Sometimes it's boilerplate that you can scan, but more often, it's closer to the 400-hour end of that extreme.<p>IDEs don't solve this problem very well, because they tend toward ""four-wheel drive"" syndrome: they get you stuck in more inaccessible places. I think <i>read-only</i> IDEs are indispensable, but if I were running a company, I'd be tempted to disallow IDEs for new development. One of the perks of maintenance is that you get to use an IDE. If you're on new development, then as long as the code is good I don't care and you can use whatever tools you want, but if I see you writing obvious ""IDE code"" I am taking that shit away.<p>One thing that I think is at the root of the problem is a denial about what programming really should be. People say ""math is hard"", but math is actually <i>easy</i>. At least, it's an only-somewhat-hard way to do things that would otherwise be impossible. Imagine what it would be like to build a physics engine if calculus and linear algebra didn't exist. How would you generalize linear regression to N dimensions without matrix calculus? Quite often, the mathematical abstraction is the simplest (and most terse) way of representing and solving a class of problems. It's hard, because of the <i>intrinsic</i> complexity. Mathematicians are also familiar with the experience of taking a whole day to read and understand a 4-page paper. They know, from painful experience, how much complexity density can exist in 100 innocent-looking lines of code.<p>Why the FactoryFactory crowd exists is that there's a class of programmers who really don't belong in the industry because they despise or can't hack math (and another class of programmers who have the ability but have been misled into thinking that FactoryFactory bullshit is actually the right way to do things). So instead of mathematical abstractions, they use pointless business-y shit made up to turn the tables against smart people with taste. (""What? You've never used a MetaSelectorVisitorSingletonFactoryFactory? And you call yourself a programmer?"") Of course, even though the individual pieces that commodity programmers create are less difficult to understand than appropriate mathematical abstractions, the overall tangle that must be generated in order to have a chance at solving the problem becomes incomprehensible quick. But (channeling a commodity programmer) ""no one reads code"" anyway. What, you expected <i>insight</i> into the problem in that shit? We just wrote that because our bosses told us to do it.<p>At any rate, your insight into the sociological problems associated with code maintenance is right-on. The work is given to the people who are least equipped to do it. So can't companies just allocate maintenance work to the best programmers? The answer is <i>no</i>. First, if the best programmers do maintenance work in a company that doesn't value that stuff, they're seen as just screwing around doing junior-level work. Second, no one good will tolerate being ""allocated"" to maintenance. Good people will happily maintain <i>code they care about</i>, but if you tell a good programmer that she has to maintain someone else's legacy or find a new job, she'll take the latter. So you need a culture in which good engineers <i>choose</i> maintenance and <i>have the political power</i> to do it right. It's really hard to make that happen.<p>Google is better than the vast majority of companies in this regard, but they still have a culture where it's well understood that promotions usually come from launches. Maintenance is relatively well-respected (by industry standards) at Google, but new invention is still better for your career. You can get promoted on maintenance (which makes Google better than most places) but your odds still aren't as good, and there's more downside to maintenance, where the worst-case outcome is macroscopic non-accomplishment (i.e. you beat your head against a wall and have nothing to show for it). There are large bonuses (sometimes 6- or 7-figures) for people who take on important legacy rescues, which is a step in the right direction-- an acknowledgment that it costs major dough to get anyone good to maintain someone else's mess-- but those usually go to managers and tech leads who oversee the rescue efforts; the engineers are ""just doing their job"" and usually try to transfer to something with more upside as soon as they can.<p>So the second point about developing a decent maintenance culture is that you need open allocation (<a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/tech-companies-open-allocation-is-your-only-real-option/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/tech-companie...</a>). You can't ""allocate"" good engineers to maintenance. They have to <i>choose</i> it, which means you need an environment where people are encouraged to work on what's important to them and to the company. I've taken to using a 2-by-2 matrix to explain this. First category work is interesting, important stuff: core machine learning algorithms, search at Google. Allocating this work is no problem. Second category is the important but undesired work. Third category is interesting stuff that hasn't become important yet: R&D-type projects best suited for ""20% time"". Fourth category is unimportant and undesirable work. Important legacy rescues are 2nd-category work. Under open allocation, companies have to create genuine incentives (not just ""do it or I'll fire you"") for people to do 2nd-category work, and 4th-category work doesn't get done (management isn't willing to pay or promote for it, because it's not actually important). But 4th category work <i>shouldn't</i> be getting done in the first place. It pisses people off and adds minimal business value.<p>By the way, closed-allocation shops generate huge amounts of 4th-category work (often the majority of the workload of a closed-allocation shop is 4th-category). If you have a closed-allocation shop, the 2nd and 4th category work gets glommed together in ""that ball of work we (management) allocate to people we dislike"" and not done well. This is a mistake; 2nd-category work actually is important (by definition) and shouldn't get the 4th-category treatment. It needs to be done by people who have the ability and actually care.<p>Third subrant, and then I'm done (for now). I don't know what OTP is, but these insights about modularity and small-program methodology are right-on. The Unix philosophy works. The only case I've seen of a program departing from the small-program philosophy and adding value is in the database world. Databases have very stringent requirements related to performance, transactional integrity, durability, and concurrency, and all the pieces have to work together. So, they become large systems that macroscopically function as huge, featureful programs. It has also taken some of the best minds in computer science <i>decades</i> to get this stuff right. Databases are hard, yo. Do you have the best minds in CS on your business-logic codeball? Do you have decades? If no, then avoid big-program methodologies outright.<p>If you use the big-program methodology, your programs end up becoming parochial because their surface area is huge and requirements get barfed on it and the code becomes a pile of political injections, not real software. You end up with Java Shop politics (<a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-politics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/04/13/java-shop-pol...</a>). However, to be fair, this problem has little to do with Java <i>itself</i> and is more accurately described as a problem afflicting large-program philosophies <i>in general</i>.",1349029215

Glider pilot Helmut Reichmann describes the technique for how to do this in a glider in his book, ""Cross-Country Soaring"". He has also performed the maneuver a couple of times.<p>You have to be flying in an area where there is strong wind shear, which means a sharp difference in wind speed with altitude. You could detect such wind shear when climbing or descending through it, either with GPS or by watching the ground and seeing how much you drift in relation to it. Cloud movements are another option. You also need a very maneuverable and aerodynamically efficient plane, so you won't lose a lot of energy from the sharp banking maneuvers required.<p>So assume that the wind speed increases sharply with altitude, maybe around 20 knots over 100 meters of altitude. You start out flying the same direction as the wind and then sharply dive 100-200 meters down into the space where the wind is weaker. This turns part of your altitude into kinetic energy, so your ground speed increases by about 100-150 kph. But due to the change in wind speed, your airspeed velocity has changed less than it would in dead air. So your total energy has increased. You can then make a sharp (>120 degree) turn in the direction you want to go, so you face partly into the wind again. You then sharply pull up, gaining about 100 meters of altitude and losing some of your velocity. The relative wind speed has increased with altitude, so your kinetic energy loss in relation to the air from pulling up is less than it would be in dead air. Overall, you have gained velocity, moved the aircraft and maintained your altitude ""for free"".<p>This process can be repeated, and you can keep doing it (albeit with some nausea, unless you're used to these sharp maneuvers) as long as there is sufficient wind shear. It will be easier to move perpendicular to the wind direction than directly with or against the wind, but the energy (altitude, velocity) you gain from this maneuver could be used to glide in any direction.<p>I don't want to make any grand claims that this technique can be used for anything practical (i.e. passenger transport). Glider pilots don't use it in competitions, because there are lots of techniques for moving around without an engine that are a lot better and easier to exploit. (You can gain altitude in thermals, ridge lift or mountain waves - and translated to horsepowers, a thermal carrying a 500kg glider upwards by 3m/s is a very powerful engine). But the technique is very cool as an intellectual curiosity.<p><a href=""http://www.cumulus-soaring.com/books/CrossCountrySoaring/Cross-CountrySoaring.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cumulus-soaring.com/books/CrossCountrySoaring/Cro...</a><p>[Edit: Actually, it's interesting that the authors mention possible applications for this to robotic aircraft. I'm sure you could make a robotic glider that used the meteorological principles that glider pilots use to move around without engines. The ""Albatross"" technique would only be a small part of this - glider pilots have extensively studied techniques for moving around without an engine, and there are lots of them. Glider pilots manage >100kph average velocities over >500km journeys on days with good weather, and robotic aircraft could in principle do the same].",1349028411

Stalking your crush is the original purpose of Facebook according to that movie.<p>The main thing e-stalking reveals is how interested the guy is, and maybe how smooth he is (smooth guys don't do as much research, or they know how to hide it better). So if he brings up the horses, she knows he's into her and maybe a little awkward, but it doesn't tell her he's definitely a psycho- she'll probably judge his weirdness from his appearance and manner.<p>The creepiness of normal stalking depends on how attractive the target finds the stalker.

I didn't have patience to watch the video, so I just read the homepage.<p>I think you should at least mention the other ""letters"" included in the library on the front page. It goes in depth into 'p', which makes it seem like it's all there is. Maybe name some of the other letters, and link to the API docs.<p>Each individual piece seems pretty small and easy enough to implement, but the package as a whole seems more valuable, having all these little tools in one place.<p>Nice work",1349028199

Using that stack I managed to write an entire web app without ever leaving Clojure.  Everything felt like clojure and the borders between client-server-database was rather fuzzy.",1349028054

I was a seller last year and whenever I found a product to sell with a good profit margin, Amazon would eventually come along and undercut me.<p>Since they can buy in much higher volumes than I, they win.<p>I recommend that nobody ever sell their products on Amazon.  Yes, it's a great market and you will get sales.  However, all of their seller support is automated and if their automated scripts somehow think you are violating one of their rules, you get kicked off forever.<p>I was kicked off after selling for 8 months with a near 100% track record and great customer service.  Why?  Amazon couldn't tell me.<p>Their answer was: ""Due to the proprietary nature of our business, we can't disclose the reason"".  They held over $5000 of my money for 90 days.  It's lucky I had savings or I would have been in trouble.<p>The customer is also king.  I had multiple scammers order over $100 in items, file a claim and get their money back without ever sending the item back to me.  Amazon (unlike Ebay) doesn't allow you to ban a scamming user nor do they care.<p>I made them thousands of dollars in my time there and they couldn't even give me the decency of a person to talk to.  I'm disgusted by their business practices.",1349028044

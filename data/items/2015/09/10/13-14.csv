I postulate that, until the moment I posted it, &#x27;3BgZhZcGPcHswmfic79jgjsfqyMKW1Rh1rkFjagJC090V2tljd9Zy2vpYJw944HG&#x27; would never have been brute-forced, even with an extremely low work factor (in fact, it wouldn&#x27;t have been brute-forced even without bcrypt, scrypt or PBKDF2: even were it just stored as a simple SHA2-512(pw) (i.e., baafbe64d25f27d4b7b2965f9abf43cf25acd8fc6021798a90253f33b3071e9fd145eaccd555290913c8679fd4acf949f05243ac1089548abbab0e0ed77e6331), no computer on earth, nor all the computers which ever have been or ever will be, would have brute-forced it (unless there&#x27;s something we don&#x27;t know about SHA2, or about computing).<p>Lesson?  Always use high-quality random passwords.  For a 128-bit security level, with upper- and lower-case letters & digits (62 characters, which means each character yields (log 62 2) = 5.9542 bits of entropy), you want a 22-character truly random password.  &#x27;xNl5gkbgXntyxi3oNO1dML&#x27; is a perfectly fine password (save for the fact that it&#x27;s now public).<p>According to the NSA [1], 256-bit keys should be used to protect data up to TOP SECRET; that works out to 43 characters.  Hence, &#x27;TIdmzj1COc9ECwcilyQYVfLl5Dt8ti3UUlDVULrUrfx&#x27; is as secure an example password as could be.<p>(Yes, I&#x27;m assuming here that your password-generation algorithm is truly random.  If not, do not pass Go; do not collect $200…)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/</a>",1441893585

You can take a huge swath of &#x27;77 code, put some 2003 and 2008 in there, and it will all just compile.<p>Python? Good luck. Every frigging month (practically) it&#x27;s a breaking change. You have to work furiously just to keep your infrastructure working, or purposefully draw a line in the sand (2.7!).<p>I run Fortran every day (via NumPy and other packages), and some of us are investigating just switching to it for some projects (we need the math speed, and all the C++ matrix libraries involve compromises of one form or another). There&#x27;s no reason I and my peers wont be doing the same in 50 years. It works, its fast, its debugged, and it is easy to use things like Python 5000 (by then over 70% of people will have made the transition from 2.7 to the 3.x version!!!) to do all the glue work that Fortran is not optimized to do.<p>Fortran codes ain&#x27;t ever going to be a liability[1]. Python 2.7 on the other hand...<p>[1] because of being Fortran. Poor coding style was endemic in Fortran77, and that can be crippling, but to a large extent that is language agnostic. I acknowledge the required short variable names of 77 doesn&#x27;t help, but people would not comment what the variables mean, and that is the real problem (IMO). Poor structure is another problem (masses of gotos). Yes, 77 doesn&#x27;t make your life easy there, but discipline is possible. We can quibble about all this; my point is the &#x27;modern&#x27; languages are going to be old quite soon, and we will face <i>real</i> porting problems then. Move 20,000,000 lines of JS and Python?

I remember in C we ended up rewriting all two dimensional arrays (matrices) to column major arrays cause it was a pain to deal with (or maybe we were noobs)\n3) useful built in functions such as matrix multiplications, in C you end up writing a lot of functions to do what seem like very simple things\n4) Great math libraries such as BLAS/LAPACK\n5) Seems to me like it less error prone than C (spend a lot less time debugging)<p>This is just my experience with it. Somewhat to my surprise I really ended up liking Fortran, and the new code doesn&#x27;t look at all like the old code. For what we did it was also slightly faster than C.

For example while duck typing is very convenient for a developer, automatic type checking really does have a maintenance benefit.<p>Here is an example.  It is no fun tracking down months after a change that a particular combination of code paths caused a run-time exception because developer 1 was plugging objects into code written by developer 2 where developer 2 expected a specific method to be available and developer 1 didn&#x27;t do it.

Robustness gets built into rail systems by adding more tracks that sit unused most of the time so you can bypass problem sections. Otherwise, a train breaks down/derails/rails go out of alignment, etc. and not just that line fails, but the entire systems is impacted. In other words, whatever solution they start with, will be overcome by the event of a fleet of self-driving taxibots.<p>Still, I think it&#x27;s fair to view the dismantlement of NYC&#x27;s above-ground rail system as having been a mistake in many ways. It was replaced by fleets of yellow cabs, and while living conditions in buildings are better, and more light gets to the streets, the road system has become more difficult to deal with.<p>Perhaps the better solution is to force all non-taxibot traffic (except for delivery trucks) to park in peripheral garages in New Jersey or somewhere and force everybody to taxibot where they want to go?<p>hmm...on second thought, I guess this is a hard problem without a single solution?",1441891823

It may not be your intention as the author for it to be a testing tool but it is, lets look at it some more.<p>Gherkin (Given-When-The)<p>Scenario: Close taxis with higher rating win\n    Given taxi A with rating 0.8 is 1400m from the customer\n    And taxi B with 0.9 is 1500m from the customer\n    When the customer requests a taxi\n    Then taxi B should be assigned<p>Lets look at the Gherkin syntax. It follows a set format with forced English language. It gives a context (Given), some input data (When) and an expectation (Then). This syntax is an example based specification and lives in a plain text file generally with the file extension *.feature. We&#x27;ll call the above example a feature based on the file extension, we&#x27;ll also call this Gherkin format an external DSL (domain specific language).<p>Now on it&#x27;s own this feature file is useless, it&#x27;s a plain text file. Why do I need Cucumber for this it&#x27;s a plain text file? Why can&#x27;t I store it in a shared wiki where people can collaborative edit it and track changes? If it&#x27;s a plain text file to share knowledge why do I need to use forced English with the Gherkin syntax instead of a more natural form for the intended audience? Why does it need to be text if it&#x27;s demonstrating shared knowledge, maybe a comic strip may be more appropriate for the domain? Why would I need Cucumber for a team to sit down to create this collaborative knowledge?<p>We need to follow this strict syntax because it&#x27;s an external DSL which is used by an interpreter. This interpreter parses a feature file and asserts a given input is equal to the expected output specified in the feature file Gherkin DSL. Lets think about this some more, we give some context, we provide some data, we run a computation and we assert the output, this sounds very much like an automated test. If I was to write a definition of an automated test this would be it.<p>This interpreter is fairly fragile. We have a miss match between the plain text feature files in our Gherkin DSL format and our test (not sure what else to call it?) execution tightly coupled with fragile regex. The implementation also promotes heavy mutation in the test (sorry, again it&#x27;s not a test?) implementation which ultimately leads to fragile assertions (aka tests).<p>I know you say don&#x27;t use UI testing tools with Cucumber, but I&#x27;ll take your own example as it demonstrates mutation quite clearly <a href=""https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/java-webbit-websockets-selenium/src/test/java/cucumber/examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/example...</a><p>The steps are stand alone<p>@Given(&quot;^I am on the front page$&quot;) will mutate sending the browser to a page. It doesn&#x27;t give an indication if it&#x27;s successful or not. The function is marked with throws InterruptedException so I can only guess it blows up if it fails, or maybe not?<p>Then we have in TemperatureStepdefs @When(&quot;^I enter (.+) (celcius|fahrenheit)$&quot;) which finds an element by id and sends some key events. Again how does the subsequent step know this is successful, how does this step know the previous step was successful? We don&#x27;t, we assume, our test may work or we may get silent errors which cascade down.<p>Then you see people use things like public String currentPage = &quot;&quot; and update it as you progress through the workflow and assert on it. Mutation, race conditions, silent failures if you&#x27;ve used Cucumber for any amount of time you&#x27;ve been deep in these trenches.<p>I digress<p>So, if Cucumber is not about the test part why do we need the interpreter which runs a computation with given input and tests it matches the expected output. Without this part Cucumber is a set of flat text files. What do we get? flat files? Why are these better than a shared wiki, google doc, spreadsheet? They achieve the same, canonical source of knowledge.<p>But Cucumber promotes a conversation. No, used in an agile productive organization features will be written collaboratively and Cucumber may be a facilitator to reach this goal. Cucumber does not enforce this or ensures this happens, it&#x27;s promoted but in no way is this a requirement to use Cucumber.<p>If you are already an efficient team delivering software you&#x27;ll already be having this communication part. Cucumber isn&#x27;t a tool for test so what does it give us if we are already talking and delivering? We have other better test tools (cucumber is not a test tool right?) and more efficient ways of collaboratively writing, sharing and tracking knowledge.<p>Cucumber is a facilitator to help organisations to start having conversations and collaboratively share knowledge. I accept this, people who are looking at ways to improve things see this as a valid usecase, it&#x27;s a trojan horse to get a more agile workflow in through the backdoor. My issue is when Cucumber is used in this way it&#x27;s used when you are knee deep in mud, it&#x27;s a technical solution to mostly a non technical issue. Your organisation is dysfunctional, likely not delivering and a command and control structure. Your team looking at Cucumber want change but the issues lie far deeper and Cucumber will not save you. Open up a Google Doc, Wiki Page, sit down with your team and stakeholders and first talk.<p>So really, what is Cucumber?<p>As a test tool it sucks. There far better automated test tools\nAs a shared knowledge base, it&#x27;s easier to collaborate in something accessible to everyone where change is easier and can be audited. A wiki, a Google Doc, a spreadsheet, it really doesn&#x27;t matter they all achieve the same goal.<p>As a facilitator, you have a non technical problem deeply rooted in how your organisation works. Sit down, have the talks, create the shared knowledgebase, solve the core issues then and only then look at technical facilitators.",1441891642

A simply API deceiving its users into thinking they&#x27;re dealing with a simple subject. Time is anything but.<p>There are a few notions of time, each wildly different from the other, which we as humans transparently conflate but which will throw computers into wild undecipherable loops:<p>* Dates, specifically delimited by days, which are logical items of a calendar, not absolute points in time. They&#x27;re never even <i>points</i>, for that matter, but explicit intervals.\n   * Which calendar? In modern, western times you&#x27;re okay with just one, but historical, international, and especially historical international dates you will fail.<p>* Wall times or local times, e.g. what a human being might think the local time is. This is what we tend to mean when something ought to happen &quot;at 3pm&quot; but you should realize that there&#x27;s no way to treat this uniformly: it holds <i>on a particular day</i>, <i>in a particular location</i>. Even simple ideas like &quot;3pm will occur once a day&quot; may not genuinely be true.<p>* Universal times, of which there are a few variations each dealing with leap seconds differently, UTC, UT0/1/1R/2, TAI (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time</a>)<p>* Intervals of universal time, like &quot;10 seconds&quot; which are the only things which behave sanely from a physical point of view. This is why CPU time or Epoch time is nice. Adding two universal time intervals produces an interval twice as long. Adding a universal time interval to a universal time point produces a new universal time point which, subject to leap seconds, may or may not appear to be the proper number of seconds away. Adding a universal time interval to anything else is nonsense.<p>* Intervals of wall-times like &quot;half a day&quot; which can be added meaningfully to combinations of wall-time and dates in a given calendar, useful for setting up human-interpretable re-occurrences.<p>* Intervals of dates which can be added to dates within a calendar<p>Other caveats apply, mostly having to do with the need to have an accurate geopolitical rundown of time disputes (the &quot;Olson&quot; database is probably sufficient) and a reasonably exact notion of where someone is in space that they are interpreting times (go look up Indiana&#x27;s time zone and then throw away your standard US 4-tz notion).<p>Generally, the idea is that when dealing with humans you want to think of time as being arranged into approximately 24-hour chunks (possibly longer or shorter and then overlapping or with weird gaps which should be smoothed out) assigned to each &quot;day&quot; of some assumed calendar. Then you can, given that person&#x27;s exact point in space, convert points in this notion of time into a universal one using the Olson database. Converting intervals is harder and must be done by converting both ends and then subtracting in universal time, handling leap seconds if you care.<p>The only time library I&#x27;ve ever used in anger which handles all of this is Haskell&#x27;s `time` library.<p><pre><code>    https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time\n    http://two-wrongs.com/haskell-time-library-tutorial</code></pre>",1441891151

This is where the Surface makes a lot of sense since I can draw/design on the go while having access to best in class software.<p>I&#x27;m not a Windows user, but it is for this very reason that I keep thinking of buying a Surface; it&#x27;s gotten some great reviews from other artists/designers.<p>I also find it discouraging that Apple has introduced their &quot;revolutionary&quot; new Pencil at a $100 price point, but I can&#x27;t find specs anywhere, and I know I can buy the Wacom Creative Stylus 2 for less money and it has 2048 pressure level sensitivity.

3146756,comment,3145330,3146673,7,0,jerf,,,"""For most of the world, I'm pretty sure jobs are about making money to survive.""<p>That's the end. The <i>means</i> is to provide something somebody wants. This is, quite profoundly, the purpose of an economy and any economic model that neglects this is forever doomed to produce gibberish.<p>Why is the classic ""paying 5 guys to dig holes and 5 guys to fill them in"" not a great way to produce 10 jobs? After all, sometimes we want holes and sometimes we want them filled in. Answer: Because implicit in the formulation is that we <i>aren't</i> putting holes where people want them, or filling in holes people want filled in. It's a waste. On the other hand, put those 10 guys to work digging holes to run a highway through, and now we're talking.<p>Why is the Broken Window Fallacy a fallacy? Because between the beginning of the story and the end of the story, nobody has any more of what they want, except the glassmaker, who would have been just as happy to put the window pane anywhere else, and it's countered by the loss to the original window owner, which is pure loss, not an economic gain.<p>Why do third-world people dig through the trash piles? Is it because they're poor and that's just what poor people do? No, it's because it's the best way they seem to have of finding things that people want out of the trash, which they then can sell, because somebody, somewhere, wants it.<p>The economy doesn't fundamentally <i>break</i> until there no longer exists any needs that can be better filled by someone else rather than yourself, and that's actually a hard world to imagine, in which everybody is equally good at everything and there exist no relative advantages anywhere. The <i>job situation</i>, which is not the same as ""the economy"", does become dire if there is created some set of people who have <i>no</i> skills whatsoever that someone is willing to pay them for rather than do themselves (with robots, AI, etc). And if you really think about what that means, personally I think we're easily 10 years away from this really being the reason why jobs are disappearing.<p>It's not efficiency, it's bad economic policy and the 30-year business cycle doing its thing. But the next bad economic business cycle may have this as a real effect.",1319392545

I wouldn't completely write off those smaller servers and I think it serves as a very good entry point for learning Linux and server administration. If you're just starting out with Node or Rails its great.<p>I would recommend someone a Low End Box over a free Amazon Micro Instance any day, just because the CPU they limit you at is just bad. You start Apache or Nginx on those things or do a big yum install/apt-get and the terminal slows to a crawl.<p>Running a Production server off any low end box is definitely risky depending on who you're hosting with, but that goes without saying. I'd second BuyVM and Xen, I had a VPS with nordic and my cluster just died one day and was unrecoverable. They gave me a free small instance for half a year, but I opted to just switch instead.<p>My other recommendation is definitely Rackspace. Their low end service is only around 10 dollars a month, their chat support service is pretty good, and its fast and easy to scale.

If you have money left over, nutrition per dollar.<p>Set a target - if you want to spend $14 a week, avoid buying foods that do worse than 1000 calories/dollar.<p>Sugar is 4000 C/$, flour and rice are about the same.  Olive oil is 1000 C/$.  Ice cream, 700 C/$.  Oatmeal, 2000 C/$.  Whole milk, 500 C/$.  Potatoes (even instant flakes) and peanut butter are also good deals.  Eggs and beans are cheap protein.<p>Vegetables are a bit trickier.  Kale for instance is only 140 C/$.  An all-kale diet would be $100 per week!  Wheat sprouts were the best I could find at 400 C/$ (and that jumps to 700 if you can find a local supplier).  Fruit is also tricky.  Grow your own if you have space.  Raspberries have great yield, require no effort besides picking them and grow almost everywhere.  But I'll assume this is not an option.<p>Meat is stupidly expensive per calorie.  Spam is one of the better deals at 400 C/$, but I do have standards.<p>So anything cheap becomes a staple.  Work these into being a large part of every meal.

But the more you fill up on the cheap stuff the more money is left over for nice things.<p>The nice stuff you ""ration"".  For example, I limited myself to at most 8oz kale and three pieces of fruit a day, as well as 8oz of nice steak a week.<p>Of course, budget a few bucks to flavor - soy sauce has no calories to speak of but it makes rice much more palatable.<p>Probably the biggest way to save money is to never eat any food you did not make your self.  Lots of clever ways to do this.  For example, lunch at work: fill a vacuum thermos with rice and boiling water, and it will be done in 90 minutes and keep hot until you eat it.<p>Can I afford to eat out all the time?  Sure.

3146603,comment,3146074,3146360,6,0,mattmanser,,,"Were you around when the iPhone came out? Do you remember the day you first saw it? As it frustrates me people reinventing history. I remember seeing an iPhone for the first time. It was literally a total game changer, revolutionary is a fair word and I use it rarely.<p>It was <i>years</i> ahead of <i>anything</i> else on the market. The UX was incredible. Everything just worked without incredibly complicated interfaces and clicking a million different options.<p>You're not looking at the whole product hard enough. The UX is what made it so incredible. The fact it was touch based when everyone said there wasn't a market or that it was too expensive was an added bonus rather than the main feature. But that multi-touch screen enabled Apple to make a truly gorgeous UX. The way it all ties together. The little (and totally un-noticable) UX features that just make it all work so well but you don't notice them any more because they're so ubiquitous because Android copied them all.<p>Specific examples:<p>1. The web browser. I remember being incredulous at the time. Nonsense! I said. Viewing normal websites on a mobile? It'll be unusable! Phooey! Then my friend passed me his iPhone and I played with the wonderful pinch and zoom. I switched websites using the on screen keyboard that unobtrusively appeared like magic when I clicked on the address. I was astounded. And totally proved wrong. They were very nascent at the time. People used to have to make websites specifically for browsers and no-one really bothered. My old company did for their browser based application (quite revolutionary at the time) and it was an extremely limited subset of functionality. See your own link, the first one, for how useless the first attempts were. What on earth are those little icons in the top right corner?<p>And Apple just walked into a market they had no experience with and, Plop! Incredible mobile web browser straight out the gate.<p>2. The home screen. You could customise it! And move stuff around. And it's accessible without pressing back 20 times! Wow. No longer were you locked into having the media player as option 8 that you had to press 9 buttons to get to. Gah, those old phone screens still make me shudder. They pretty much exposed every setting as a gigantic list on your home screen. And there were so many options. I still feel a little surprised every time I open the iPhone's general settings.<p>3. The contacts book, no phone before the iPhone had a usable contact book. It was a list. If you were lucky you could search. But that would probably be at least a few button presses on top of the search.<p>4. Text message interface. Totally different to how other phones did it, conversation based instead of just a list (see your own link for how it used to be done).<p>5. The email tie-in. A simple UX for emails? Nice little notifications? Push? In a consumer phone? It's not a blackberry? Incredible!<p>6. The media player. An intuitive interface for playing or manipulating playing songs? And iTunes! Crap as it may be in today's eyes, it was so much better than the crud that came bundled with other phones at the time.<p>7. The microphone, volume controls and phone answering.<p>8. The 'silent' mode switch. Faffing around through about 10 actions to turn on silent mode? No more, one tactile feedback switch with the added bonus that you can run your thumb over it in your pocket to see if silent mode is on.<p>9. The synch just worked. You just plugged it in and it worked. In the 3 or 4 years that the other manufacturers had computer tie-in they'd managed to produce every conceivable piece of rubbish synching software you could imagine. The iPhone was the first phone I saw anyone actually bother to synch with their computer.<p>10. The wi-fi. It has wifi? No way. And it just works? Not 20 minutes fiddling, it just worked. And it did amazingly smart things like use the wifi for email and browsing when you were near a known network. This. Is. Amazing. The reason it had this incredible feature was because it had a mobile browser that would have caned your mobile data plan which were restrictive to say the least. Other phones didn't have wifi connections.<p>The list is much, much longer than this. There's just so many little tweaks and incredible modifications they made to how a mobile phone should operate that beggar belief that anyone would claim it's just a 'step', it was a gigantic leap.<p>Phone manufacturers were total failures when it came to the actual software for their phones. Total and utter failures. They couldn't do it! The UX was always horrific. The iPhone changed that permanently.<p>It reinvented usable mobile phones. Before that everyone just used a tiny subset of the capabilities because they were so god-damn complicated.<p>And Android took it all. Copied it. This is what Android looked like when the iPhone came out, it looked like every other phone on the market, a terrible UX, with absolutely no vision:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJHYqE0RDg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJHYqE0RDg</a><p>I've said before, credit where due to the android team for changing direction so fast and so well, but they lifted that OS from Apple, no doubt in my mind.<p>NB: I'm not an Apple fanboi, I only have an iPhone.

If you're familiar with perl, awk, or ruby, some of these conventions will be familiar to you. If you're more familiar with Java, they'll feel odd and you'll feel an uncertainty using them.",1319389576

Technical works are of most interest, but I'll take good SF.  And if you financed  your first start-up by writing bodice-rippers, that has to be of some interest.",1319389562

That seems reasonable, but if there is a huge pool of people willing to do them, wouldn't the supply level depress the wages to below what we consider minimum wage? Unless we lower minimum wage, we'd have massive unemployment. And if we did, we'd have a very poor class of people.<p>I have a more charitable view of the essay, I don't think he's claiming we should have a war on efficiency, I think he's claiming we need a new structure to our economy that works when you have a massive spread between the rich and poor.<p>And I think he has a point, if we don't try to get ahead of the curve on this one we'll just end up with our current system with higher progressive taxes using that money on social programs, make-job programs, and bureaucratic jobs that will never go away for lack of budget pressure.<p>edit: After thinking more, maybe the original author IS implying we should retard efficiency and not just create structural change that copes better. In that case, I think he's misguided.",1319389560

Sure this is a community of technology entrepreneurs who generally do not have trouble finding new and innovative ways of surviving in the modern world's job market. But how naive it is for this community to project its experience onto the masses.<p>It's also a good reminder that these minimal intelligence jobs that most are falling back on will A) be automated next, and B) should not be considered as good for our society as more challenging jobs before. They lead to an overall brain rot in society.<p>Sure if we all have more free time to pursue what we wish, that's great.

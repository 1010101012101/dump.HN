3750273,comment,3746692,3749213,1,0,regularfry,,,"I think you're underestimating how much work the type system is doing here: `option` <i>isn't</i> a function.  It's part of the return type definition.  The whole point of having a type system as strict as ML's or Haskell's is to avoid the sort of problem you had in VB6.  Automatic typecasting is a very, very different beast to type inference: in Haskell, your problematic code likely wouldn't have got past the compiler.  You're precisely wrong when you say that it's easy to break the hd function by changing the implementation to return a different type.  If you do that, your program won't build.",1332615389

The Land provided food, water, shelter, warmth, entertainment, animals, and other things.<p>The trade of Manhattan for wampum beads is a perfect example: The European thought he got a killer deal because an island was worth far more than those beads. The Native thought, 'the land will be here after he dies, as he belongs to the land'. The native got a better deal because it wasn't a trade.<p>Native Americans of all the tribes had a very strong sense of ownership.

Maybe for some reason, your DRM-protected media doesn't get pirated as quickly but takes a couple days but that doesn't mean that during those days that people actually bought your stuff! It might mean that nobody bought it so there was nobody to share it. Or it might just mean that only people who always buy legit media bought it because I guarantee ya that if the media is popular, there are people who wait for it to arrive on file sharing sites and they'll never buy it unless it doesn't hit the scene for  more than a few months.<p>So, the real thing to consider is money spend on DRM vs money lost on first sales because the rule is: If it's popular, it will be distributed illegally!",1332615226

Does it have some fancy theoretical advance? No way. It's simple and naive.<p>But it's <i>different</i> b/c i just made one up from scratch instead of copying it. It's a little quirky. That means if you played a bunch of platformers before, this one won't feel too repetitive, because the physics are different. It gives you something new to learn and get used to and figure out how to use to your advantage.<p>Example: in my game, ground tiles have high friction, air has much less, and ice tiles have even less than that. Therefore to land on ice and stop yourself you usually want to jump right after landing and put on the brakes while back in the air instead of while sliding on the ice.<p>Every game really does need to have something that's different from other games to give you some reason to play this game instead of those other games.<p>And it's not that hard to do that. Even if you're making a remake. All remakes should change <i>something</i> to be a little different from prior games.<p>Even if you're doing a sequel and do not change the art or game engine at all, you could still say ""what it has that no other game has is MORE LEVELS that you haven't played before in the original"".

I'm talking about people that are the poorest of the poor who would never see a university let alone be able to attend one. A lot of folks on here are talking about certification...certification doesn't matter, rather creating wealth matters! We're on YC Hacker News right now, I'm sure everybody has read Paul Graham's ""How To Create Wealth"" essay (<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>). A person with a college degree or higher is useless to society if they can't produce something with it. However, somebody with little or zero formal education that can create something world changing IS valuable! Just giving people access to information allows them to change their world and create wealth. Some of you may have heard of William Kamkwamba (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kamkwamba"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kamkwamba</a>) who created a windmill that could generate electricity just after seeing a picture of a windmill on the cover of a book written in a language he couldn't read. I saw an interview with him on ""The Daily Show"" where he joked that when he had the opportunity to access the Internet for the first time, he typed ""windmill"" into Google and was like ""where was this when I was trying to build that damn windmill?!"". People like him can do so much just with a picture -- imagine if he had access to science and math lectures from an amazing university like Stanford.<p>We have finally reached that point (or are at least damn close to it) where virtually every person on the planet, no matter how poor, will have access to a computer and the Internet. That is all a person needs to access these resources. I'm sure everybody has been following the Raspberry Pi, a full-fledged computer with video output for $25 - and it's only going to get cheaper. People like Thruun and Khan are dead-on. The only way to get people out of poverty is by empowering them with knowledge and education. In my opinion, the work these folks are doing are the seeds of a coming worldwide renaissance where poverty and ignorance will be eliminated.",1332614119

You cannot use C# without the BCL, so why evaluate it without the BCL? How do the following sit with you?<p>- Events, i.e. the observer pattern, are indeed supported first class by way of the `event` keyword and BCL `Delegate` type. And the whole point of properties is to be syntactic sugar to hide implementation details by surfacing state accessors with field-like mechanics. If you need a quick and easy way to reference a ""getter method"", you're breaking the abstraction and shouldn't use properties. That's the trade off.<p>- The BCL provides multiple generic, high-performance `Tuple` types.<p>- Destructing. Memory management is handled by the GC, so what would destructing even mean? The `using` keyword along with BCL type `IDisposable` provides a very usable mechanism for releasing non-memory/unmanaged/OS resources.<p>- This is mostly valid. That said, `ICloneable` can get you most of the way w.r.t. the copy ctor. As far as the numeric generic, one is required to make do with type-specificity and method overrides, since the numeric types were written without generics in mind. Or you can implement your own numeric type system. Do that once and you can write numeric generics to your heart's desire.<p>- How could this work with auto-properties?<p>- Trivial to implement a `NonNull<T> where T : class`. But because of other language constructs (`??` operator) idiomatically `null` references are not considered the end of the world. Design by contract support in the BCL `Contract` type alleviates this as well.<p>edit: expanded property method explanation.",1332612473

They brought DMCA, made reverse-engineering illegal (even if no infringement happened), pushed for SOPA and are willing to go even further.",1332612095

So you can't be sure your code does what you think it does, without compiling and testing with every compiler for every platform you intend to target.\n - C is a low-level language which has its niche. But most of the time you want quite different features, like runtime monitoring, inspection and debugging.\n - In C you can't just move your binary to a different architecture and run it there, same thing in Python: You can't just deploy your pyc or pyo files on a different machine and expect it to work, especially not if the versions differ.\n - You can't even do that for source files: Python breaks compatibility frequently, and because it is dynamically typed, you can't just check the signatures that nothing has changed and chances are you won't even see breaking changes until it crashes at runtime.\n - Python is not nearly as fast as a decent JVM.\n - Both languages lack a cross-platform UI toolkit, although yes, AWT and Swing suck, and JavaFX isn't that great either.<p>I agree though, that the whole ""framework"" stuff has grown out of proportions in Java. It is just a disease if a simple application ships with 40 MB of JAR files because the developer couldn't write any non-trivial functionality himself.<p>> IDEs are language smells<p>This smells like envy from someone whose ""favorite"" language lacks good IDE support, but yes, Java-the-language is just outdated.<p>> Java the language is considerably better than Java-the-ecosystem<p>WUT? Java-the-language is the weakest part. You don't have to use any Java library or framework at all and Hotspot is probably the only freely available VM which is fast, mature and stable.",1332612084

On the opposite end of the spectrum, in a place like Vegas or Miami, your rent will be significantly more than your mortgage payment.<p>I think a buy-to-rent ratio of about 15 (i.e. 15 years rent = purchase price) is about where buying and renting break even. If you live in a place with a lower ratio, your mortgage payment would be less than the rent on the equivalent place; if you live in a place with a higher ratio, you can get a nicer place for the same monthly amount by renting. <a href=""http://explore.trulia.com/datavis/rentvsbuy/Q2-2011/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://explore.trulia.com/datavis/rentvsbuy/Q2-2011/</a>",1332612069

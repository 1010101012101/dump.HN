Git checkout seems so natural to me in the way it functions, and I use it so often, that it would annoy the hell out of me if I had to force it or answer a y/n prompt every time I used it.<p>What you think of as intuitive is not universal.  Your reasonable defaults are unreasonable to me.  This seems to be a problem of audience.  Git can be challenging to learn, but it's not aimed at learners.  It's aimed at power users.<p>As others have pointed out, there are other front-ends to git.  You don't have to use the default porcelain.",1254787170

It's difficult not to ad hom him here, but the article drips with scare quotes, special pleading, straw men and appeals to authority, so what's one more fallacy?<p>In fact, although I imagine he wants it to be taken seriously, it reads like little more than an angry forum comment dressed in academic robes. He's obviously heated and insulted by Krugman, and given that Chicago is broadly seen as discredited by the recent crash he is also concerned for his image, and is responding in kind.<p>The real economic lessons of the past few years are not to be found here, or anywhere. They will emerge in years to come. The difficulty is we only have the ability to really push through changes and learn from them <i>now</i>, so everyone's trying to be a part of that action. At least it's clear from both Krugman and Cochrane that the incentives enjoyed by bankers are very badly designed, and that's one issue we can address.",1254787109

I understand that this broadly means funding the acquisition of a company by placing the debt on the target company's balance sheet but every explanation I have read just leaves  too many obvious holes: <i>The goal is to buy a company for $100m and sell it for $500m.</i> (why does such a gap exist and why are private equity funds the only ones jumping on it?) or <i>Instead of taking on the equity themselves, the fund will place this debt on the target company's balance sheet, not its own</i> and statements like <i>target companies often have strong cash flow that can be used to service the loan </i>(How does a company worth $100m take on $500m in debt <i>without</i> going bankrupt? If it can do this [I assume they would be paying very junk bond rates of 20% or so], that means that they could have paid that amount in dividends to the owners instead and should be worth a lot more then purchase price.)<p>It reminds me of those hack video by Guy Kiyosaki about how rich people print money: <i>I create a company and invest $10,000 in it. At $0.01 per share that is 1,000,00 share. Then I take the company to IPO and sell the shares for $1-$2 each.</i> He then explains the math on whiteboard. $10,000 /0.01 * $1 - $10,000 = $990,000.

863110,comment,862859,863015,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I think it's pretty tough to make the case that economic and educational inequality in the United States along racial lines is intrinsically a good thing, particularly given the historical context.<p>I'll address it, but before I do - look at how you framed the question and response. It's mildly disingenuous and makes it hard to have a discussion. Take this:<p>""I think it's pretty tough to make the case that economic and educational inequality in the United States along racial lines is intrinsically a good thing""<p>I don't know anyone that's making that claim. I mean that literally - I don't know anyone who says, ""Economic and educational inequality along racial lines is a good thing."" Most certainly I didn't make the claim, and I don't know of anyone that has.<p>But let's talk about relative inequality, because it's important. Take some groups of people - could be race, gender, religion, favorite color of car, anything. Some of the groups are doing better than others.<p>Is there a problem there? Well, sure, there is. You've got some people not doing as well as the rest of people. It'd be good for them to do better.<p>But is the problem that there are others that are doing well? Well, this comes down to how you think the world operates. Is most wealth created by people benefiting humanity or destroying humanity?<p>This can actually be looked into, and generally speaking, the way to get wealthy is to benefit humanity. This is kind of new thinking though - the old world thinking is that stealing from and oppressing people was what successful people were doing. This leads to innate hostility to people doing well, which is misplaced. The path to wealth these days to benefit other people, as Vietnamese entrepreneurs and Jewish scientists have done.<p>So here's what I'm saying: You should do the best you can. If someone is not doing as well as you, it would be good for them to do better. It would not be good for you to do worse. You should not feel guilty or uneasy about doing well, or about the race or religion you're part of doing well. You can feel bad that other races or religions aren't doing as well. But you should always feel good that you're doing well, and keep trying to do well, and do right as much as you can while doing well.",1254785920

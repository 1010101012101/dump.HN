2012207,comment,2012041,2012041,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Just the other day I had to make a choice between using threads and event loops for an IO bound workload (in Python). The constraints were that I already had a piece of code that implemented its own event loop and I didn't feel like re-writing it; and I needed this code to be very memory conservative. Well, I tried threads. I figured why not? They are so ridiculously easy to work with in Python. Turns out there is no problem whatsoever for my workload to run on a 1000 independent threads and the memory usage goes up by only about 20MB. The best thing about it is that I don't have to re-write my underlying library and since everything I do here is IO bound, the GIL does not bother me.<p>My big problem with event loops is that while your framework may be all asynchronous, your code will not be. Try to make a call to MySQL and you will block the entire process. On the other hand, in this case your thread will just be put in a sleep mode and another thread will take over. Yes, there is overhead, but depending what you are doing, threads can be a great tool.",1292511537

2012186,comment,2011300,2011624,0,0,mathgladiator,,,"It's basically an HTTP crontab replacement that does a bit more than crontab. Crontab is very regular where as crondom can be irregular. For instance, When there is a lot of events to handle, you want polling to be very fast (1 second resolution). However, where there are very few events, you want the polling to be very slow (every 2 minutes). crondom enables this use case by enabling the developer to determine how long to wait until the next hit.<p>You can also break up a cron job into # of clients. This enables you to process reasonable large # of clients by giving each client a URL to go with rather than doing the work at the moment. For instance, you want to pull 1000 user twitter feed every day. Well, if it takes 1 second, then you have 1000 seconds of work for the script, or 16 minutes. Most developers are forced to live within 30 seconds per request.<p>In this same scenario, what happens when it fails for user 377? what happens for 378? Handling errors is not always straight forward especially from a business case. Ideally, crondom will enable us to graph for failure cases (coming soon) and isolate which part of the cron task failed.",1292511186

2012128,comment,2011805,2011914,0,0,briangreen,,,"I prefer my students do their assignments on paper because its a lot easier to grade.  I have yet to see an online method that works as easily as paper -- I have often though about developing my own but have not had the time.  One example, you give an online test or exam, you have to click about 50 times to get through all the essay questions, and then you still have to get the grades into some other system since many of them can't import/export a standard format.  And if those essays are homework and a student turns it in late, you get to the end of the semester and the student asks why you didnt give them credit; they have to notify you they did the assignment after the due date, otherwise you wont know its completed.  The alternative is checking all your assignments online periodically to see if any new submissions are posted from previouse assignments.  I know this sounds like its not a big deal, but multiply these frustrations by 120 students, and you start to get an idea that its not as simple as you make it out to be.<p>I think one innovation that might make this easier is standardizing of test formats in XML, so they can easily be migrated between platforms.  Standardizing grade sheets might help too, so when you start using one system you are not locked in.  I have tests in one online system that I do not care for, but to migrate to Moodle I have to rewrite everything from scratch.<p>The bottom line is that whether your students use pen and paper, fancy online systems like Moodle etc, learning does not change much.  Students still need to learn, and professors still need to asses them in basically the same way.  If technology does not offer some advantage that can't be replicated with ""stone knives and bear skins"" you gain nothing and its difficult to justify moving to technology.",1292510162

The administrators making the buying decisions compare competing products according to price and feature lists. Therefore, we were encouraged to match and exceed the feature count of the competition in order to get sales. If the new features introduced a few bugs or made the user interface awkward, that was less of a problem than not getting the features out in time for the academic year buying cycle. The buyers might never use the product enough to experience the problems. Other commercial software developers have similar struggles with the balance of more features, meeting market windows, and maintaining good design and quality.

You make it sound like the parents are the target customers for these schools, but based on how the schools target their advertising they realize that their target customers are very much the kids.<p>Now admittedly I don't have teenage kids, but from what I hear I imagine it is non-trivial to tell them that they can't go to the school they have their heart set on and instead must go to a school they don't want to go to at all.  And even if the parent does win that particular battle of wills, I image that the kids motivation will have taken quite a beating.  I suppose at the end of the day most parents reason that it's better to send their kids to a bad school they are enthusiastic about rather than a good school they don't want to go to.",1292509103

2012034,comment,2011805,2011805,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Ah, education... this is one of my big bugbears, and it's a really big one, so bear with me :) The issue is multi-faceted:<p>* <i>Stifled curriculum</i>; Here in the UK the curriculum is pretty shoddy. My mother is a primary teacher and trying to innovate her teaching is extremely difficult - the curriculum simply cannot cope. It is unwieldy and disjointed, and almost without exception tech innovators do not understand how it works and how to accomodate it (n.b. this is not simply a tech problem, my dad runs a successful mobile planetarium business and, through my mother, knows how to accomodate what is needed - their competitors pop up every few months and quickly flounder because <i>school level education is unlike any other learning ever conceived</i> :)).<p>* <i>Teacher apathy</i>; not all of them, but enough. They follow the worksheets and guidelines and don't ""disrupt"" the system enough to make a serious change. You'll get a few great ones in each school (I'm sure we all have some memorable/fav teachers) but most are simply either bad or good teachers, and not innovators.<p>* <i>Teacher luddites</i>; even the very best teachers can be luddites (meant in a polite sense). Getting them to accept and use new tech is hard enough, but when the teachers often have no IT skills (this is a problem that will be fixed in a few generations, I guess) themselves there is simply no chance :)<p>* <i>Teaching unions</i>; don't give a crap about education (partly understandable), and exercise their power to interfere a little too much.<p>* <i>Bureaucracy</i>; you honestly have never experienced bureaucracy until you have ever tried to do anything in a school. This varies greatly, and can exist as stupid rules through to silly government policy (the one at the moment is that my mum has to ""evidence"" and present all the work her kids do during the year... I guess to prove they aren't just playing with lego all day???)<p>* <i>Funding</i>; there is none. Most good teachers (esp. primary teachers) will fund a lot of the non-curriculum ideas they have (such as, science clubs) as there is no money. And when there is it is spent shoddily. For example; mums school have digital whiteboards and laptops for all the teachers to hook up. In the last three years they have had three suppliers (all council approved contracts..) - all of who have fucked up in various ways and been replaced. Most of the whiteboards fail at some point (v. poor quality), the laptops are slow, clunky and a mess. They can never get anything done (Mum has a pile of CDs/DVDs with educational programs that she can't ""ta da"" install on the laptop to test....)<p><i>tl;dr: education is a mess because previous good education has tried and failed (dismally) to adopt modern ideas and adapt to modern society. There is no money, innovation or interest in educating our children.</i><p>(n.b. not all teachers are at fault. In fact; a large number will raise these exact issues if you ask them, but are completely stumped as to how to fix and disrupt it. Innovation is desperately needed - but be prepared for a long long slog :))",1292508362

7942734,comment,7941757,7942686,3,0,vacri,,,"Come on guys, give me some credit. We&#x27;re having problems with internal processes right now because our offices are split between Melbourne and San Francisco, and there&#x27;s only 2 hours in the regular working day of overlap. Being a couple of hours out is nothing compared to being almost the entire working day out.<p>The more your support has to do shift work, the harder it is to get and vet support, train them properly, and the more expensive they are to pay. The more they&#x27;re awake during normal sleeping hours, the lower the quality of support - and I say this having spent two years doing support for in-timezone sleep medicine equipment. The article also states other problems with response lag and low efficiency, which is what happens if you can&#x27;t adjust your work day (and if you do, then you&#x27;re out of sync with local services).<p>The kind of condescending &#x27;get over it&#x27; comment from grecy is <i>utterly</i> beside the point - regardless of whether you deal with it well or not, out-of-timezone sync support <i>is</i> more difficult to do, and that is something worth mentioning in a list of hurdles an Australian startup might face.",1403683140

A simple example is that IMAP expects a message to be in a single folder but Gmail allows you to use multiple labels. I&#x27;m pretty sure that this particular issue had no real impact, but there are others that do (difference in handling deleted messages sounds right?)

It seems like the internet has rewritten most of the world&#x27;s social rules, and we have to acknowledge that, on average, we seem to be moving closer to a meritocracy.  I&#x27;m keenly aware of how strange it sounds to call an insider-driven industry (VC funding) a meritocracy, but if you compare the current state of affairs to any point in history prior to 20 years ago, people care far more about what you have (users) than who are you are or what your pedigree is.",1403682613

Even so linux one day decided to swap out parts of the database&#x27;s memory, i assume since that was very rarely used and it was decided that something else would be more useful to have in memory. When the time came for queries that used that part of the database, they had a huge latency compared to what was expected.<p>Maybe i&#x27;m misremembering and maybe there was some way of preventing that from happen while still having a swap enabled on the server..",1403682482

Consider a driver who drives into a pedestrian killing him, because at an unfortunate moment, the driver was paralyzed by an unexpected stroke. The driver witnessed the entire event with full understanding of what it means to take a life. Is he morally culpable? I would say no, because he was not <i>in control</i>. You can also imagine similar scenarios involving coercion or accidents.<p>The key point is whether we are in control of our actions, or merely witnesses with the illusion of control.

This phenomenon (the overjustification effect, researched by Deci, Lepper and quite a few others) certainly exists, but certain preconditons have to be met for it to become a problem. Most importantly, the person doing the work has to be highly intrinsically motivated. If that person then gets rewareded monetarily (extrinsical motication), the intrinsic motivation gets reduced. The consequence is an increase in quantity and decreasing quality of the productive output of the person.<p>But there are <i>many</i> situations where people already start with no or only extrinsical motivation: They do it for the reputation (reputation is an extrinsical motivator), they are college students who have to learn the topic anyway (so would profit from a second extrinsical motivator besides passing the test) etc. - basically every case where the person is not motivated doing the writeup because it enjoys that exact moment.<p>tl;dr: the  overjustification effect exists, but will only affect your project marginally.

This was kind of a joke, but it's true.<p>It only applies to sites that have viral content in nature.<p>Basic formula:<p>Create (or find) some pictures, videos, etc that are extremely viral.<p>Submit them to StumbleUpon (or have a friend do it).  Try a few different sets / pieces of content until you find a formula that works.<p>Note: spamming SU with crappy content won't work.  Your stumble only takes off if it's actually given thumbs up by other users, which in turn causes it to get shown more often.",1179049545

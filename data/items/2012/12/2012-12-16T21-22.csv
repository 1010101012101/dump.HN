Instead of writing n^2 translation algorithms, you'd only need 2n: one to translate into the intermediary, and one to translate out. Such a language would have to be incredibly flexible though; my vote is for lojban ;). Done correctly, such a system could also teach the intermediary language to the speaker during translation.

Owning a house, of course, but also renting -- you have to deal with minor damage, rent, keeping the landlord informed (""I didn't notice water started leaking in during the winter"" is very bad).<p>Debt, of course -- what if you can't quit an exhausting job you detest, because you're paying down large debts?<p>Many of these things are rewarding (I love having a dog, for example, though it does make some things hard...) -- I'm not saying don't do them, just realize what you're trading.

4929630,comment,4927168,4927168,2,0,mjw,,,"I've taken courses from people in a few of these overlapping but historically-different camps recently, e.g.:<p>- Frequentist statisticians
- Bayesian statisticians
- Old-school AI researchers
- Statistical learning theorists
- Bayesian machine learners
- Engineers working on optimisation with noisy data
- Information retrieval folks
- ...<p>I'm really keen to see these guys starting to talk to each other and unify more of what they're doing around statistics (Bayesian and frequentist, parametric and non-parametric, generative and discriminative) as the common language and framework. Hopefully expanding the horizons of statistics a bit as a field in the process.<p>I imagine it'll take a while longer though, and some of the differences in terminology and talking-past-each-other can be a bit maddening in the mean time for those learning. What would be really nice would be a course offering a broad, well-rounded introduction to the various different philosophies to modelling data, their histories, interactions and overlaps, differing goals, strengths and weaknesses. It can be hard to get a sense of this when most introductory courses are taught by someone who's implicitly from one camp or another, even if (as is usually the case) they're not overly ideological about it.<p>One criticism of (some, not all!) statisticians is that they can seem to have a strange and rather limiting fear of computation which leads them to give undue preference to computationally simple models, even when the dataset isn't big enough to make compute time an issue.<p>I can see an argument for pedagogical reasons why one would rather not teach (or learn!) the details of fiddly optimisation algorithms -- but having a basic literacy in optimisation can free you up to treat the algorithm for optimising your objective as a black box to some extent. Feeling less ""guilty"" about this (whether the compute time itself, or remembering all the details of the optimisation algorithm) can be quite freeing in allowing you to think about the modelling itself in a more powerful, modular framework. This seems to be where machine learning has gotten a big advantage.<p>On the other hand machine learners can be frustrating in the way they reinvent statistical terminology and methods. Also in a gratuitous tendency to skip the modelling stage and go straight to inventing different objective functions to optimise, or even straight to the algorithms. Leading to opaque black-box methods which (due to the lack of probabilistic motivation) make it harder to reason about uncertainty in a principled way.<p>With the increasing popularity of Bayesian machine learning I think this is less of an issue though, it's bridging the gap between the two camps. One can also find a lot of more modern ML research using Statistical Learning Theory as a nice framework for principled frequentist analysis of their models.",1355693638

From the HN welcome page:<p><pre><code>    What does ""deeply interesting"" mean? It means stuff that teaches
    you about the world. A story about a robbery, for example,
    would probably not be deeply interesting. But if this robbery
    was a sign of some bigger, underlying trend, then perhaps
    it could be.

Unlike horoscopes, individual descriptions do differ rather significantly. The biggest issue in my view is not a fundamental one, but rather a flawed set of assumptions. The principle being that the test taker, possesses intimate self knowledge and presents an accurate and unchanging self portrait. In addition to the wonderful qualities humans have, there remains a number possible impairments with regards to self assessment: bias, delusion, deceitfulness, fancifulness, ignorance or simply an innocent unrefined skill in introspective ability.  Thus the issue appears to largely be with the test itself, and not so much any solid refutation of the Jungian theory on which it rests.<p>While Jung certainly had some strange and mystical ideas, which would be difficult to support in today's scientific environment, his theory of cognitive functions is uncannily prescient IMHO, and believe is most deserving of further scrutiny. He is also largely responsible for the introducing the concepts of extraversion/introversion in the early part of the last century which have remained a mainstay on both public and academic discourse. [5]<p>Thus upon reflection, the observation of Jung as a mystic, is not necessarily an indication of a weak mind. One should not overlook the fact Sir Isaac Newton, perhaps one of the greatest scientists of all time, had strong mystical[1] and occultist[2] leanings too.<p>One might argue ""well, the 1600's are quite different to the 1900's and Jung ought to have known better"". Yet if the whole idea of a personal God seems rather delusional in the 21st century, the fact that credible scientists continue to partake in it today, does not simply invalidate their scientific discoveries. For example, James Smalley's [3] won the Nobel prize for the discovery of Buckyballs while simultaneously being an ardent supporter of old earth Creationism. Another example would be notable Christian apologist and Human Genome Project pioneer, Francis Collins [4]).<p>Returning to the issue of the test itself, the primary concern is that it it relies on self-report and is not a direct measure of the <i>physical</i> cognitive diversity existing between brains.<p>On the topic of Jung and neuroscience there is some preliminary proto-research by done by UCLA researcher Dario Nardi investigating the possible evidence for Jung's cognitive functions within the brain. He gave a talk at Google in 2011

As with any non-peer reviewed work, it should be treated with due skepticism.<p>Lastly, for those interested in further reading, I have digitized a copy of Jung's seminal work, 'Psychological Types (1921)' [5] am sharing it for anyone wishing to study the source material.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newtons_religious_views"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newtons_religious_views</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newtons_occult_studies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newtons_occult_studies</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Smalley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Smalley</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins#Christianity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins#Christianity</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=extraversion%2Cintroversion&year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share="" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=extraversion%2C...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/hrf6whb66fbmaux/Psychological%20Types.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/hrf6whb66fbmaux/Psychological%20Ty...</a>",1355692253

Sadly, I either wrote up the post poorly, or the method of asking outright on forums is a bad idea.<p>Coming from a business background, I just assumed that any idea people would put out there would have been small solutions to small problems... not ""sitcom startups"", products with no market, or funny stabs at combining nouns with an airbnbnb business model.  Perhaps I was wrong. Really the only thing I was looking for were problems that could potentially be solved with minimal capital, and only 1 or 2 people.<p>Maybe looking for small problems, solutions, and actionable ideas can't be done on internet forums... It didn't seem too unthinkable for me to imagine someone like Patrick responding to my initial post with something like this:<p>""You know what? Some teachers have approached me to build a Bingo Card Creator, and are willing to pay for it.  I may be able to introduce you to them.   Personally, I have zero interest in pursuing this, but maybe you do.  Obviously, you will want to do your own market research, but you likely have at least a few sales.  The market is niche, and I am pursuing something a little bigger that interests me more, but it could be worth a look for you.  A sweet bonus is that this can probably be executed by a single person.""<p>Interestingly, Paul himself seems to have started a company that might be earning him money and could have originated in that thread.<p>I was looking for ideas like Posters for verticals. Maybe Paul didn't want to start doing posters for microbreweries, but knew that people wanted them. Is any sharing of small business ideas completely useless?<p>Yes he went on to validate the idea, knowing that spending half a year building an app or product and trying to market it prior to validation isn't very intelligent, but I thought that was implied.",1355692142

4929527,comment,4928299,4928901,1,0,maratd,,,"> Can you explain why more people causes price to go up?<p>Sure. As you know, price is the intersection of supply and demand. An increase in a population is, in economic terms, an increase in demand. This will cause the price level to increase.<p>Over time, supply will increase to match the new demand level, but to what extent and more importantly, the time frame involved, will be dependent on the good/service in question. The supply for some goods and especially most services, isn't easily increased. There is a finite number of lawyers, doctors, etc. to provide services and it take time to train more. Regulations get in the way, licensing, etc. And, of course, there are pressures on the raw materials used to manufacture goods.",1355692010

1181934,comment,1181679,1181868,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My impression is that Facebook stole a lot of the potential Twitter thunder. For communicating among your Facebook friends, Facebook status updates are at least as good as Twitter, maybe better. A lot of my friends are on Facebook, more every day; far fewer are also using Twitter.<p>IMHO Twitter is a tool for following interesting people who aren't close enough to you to be your friend in something like Facebook. But what makes someone interesting on Twitter? Being a celebrity is not it: Most celebrities aren't famous for generating Twitter-type content. They're famous for acting or sprinting or golf or good looks, none of which translates well to Twitter.<p>Being an important company is not it, either, unless you enjoy reading press releases or are a serious power user.<p>The people I follow are hackers, writers, artists, and good linkers. People who are otherwise hard to follow via mass media, but are not close enough to be personal friends. It doesn't surprise me that the audience for that is large but not gargantuan, just as it doesn't surprise me to know that the market for novels is an order of magnitude smaller than the market for sitcoms.<p>It also doesn't surprise me that the Twitter audience skews older.

I have written in a variety of languages, and my number one complaint, whether it be with eclipse, textmate, vim, emacs, whatever, is the clumsiness of going from one file to another and then back to the original.  Further, outside of actual development, when debugging, I really like to have all the different pieces open at once.  This is a nice way for this to happen and is pretty slick with the different gui movement options.  I, like other posters, would be really psyched if you could have some kind of MVC opener which would automagically open all the code files using a certain view.  That would save a lot of time shuffling, and then save a lot of time by having them all displayed simultaneously.  Anyway, I'm probably over reacting, but after years of having to go back to the mouse everytime i need to look at a new file or struggling to figure out in which square i put which file, this is definitely, in my opinion, a step in right direction.",1268254235

With that pattern, MS supplies a default implementation, but you're free to build your own.<p>Our web site uses a custom Resource Provider, allowing us to store all the translations into a database. And the key to getting the resources back out isn't just the user's language, but also the Customer's identity, so that all the text in the site is completely customizable per customer.<p>The end result is something that's probably easier to maintain than the ""Everybody Else"" that the OP references.<p>Oh, and under ""Referencing Translated Text (by using)"", I don't get the complaint. You can name your resource anything you want, so it can be just the same as ""The text itself"" if you want. But in rich, complex systems it's frequently not safe to leave it as such.

1181896,comment,1181503,1181503,0,0,dasil003,,,"I'm intrigued by Heroku (and EY Cloud), but the thing that really freaks me out is how they charge for every little extra thing.  I love the idea of a turnkey solution for Rails deployment and cloud scalability, but for me personally I don't think I would do a startup on it because the value proposition is squeezed from both sides.<p>On the low-end I can get a VPS for $10-$20 month and get a Rails app up and running for a significant number of users with just that modest outlay.  I can install SSL and any software I want and have a predictable amount of resources to play with.  Yes, there is some sysadmining overhead, but setting up Nginx w/ passenger is like an hour of work once you've been through it a couple times, and similarly a lot of the add-ons that Heroku charges a monthly fee for are just a small one-time time investment.  When I'm trying to bootstrap something really small the last thing I want is ramping up a significant recurring cash costs just to run some open source software that is really not hard enough to setup or maintain to justify recurring costs.<p>On the high-end when I'm using a lot of server resources, I'm paying a growing premium for a given amount of resources.  Now don't get me wrong, it's nice to be able to magically adjust for traffic spikes, but if I have a consistently high amount of traffic, once again I'm paying a high recurring cost for actual resources that are a fraction of the cost, <i>especially</i> if I need any add-ons which are not inherently resource-intensive—maybe I'm actually just paying for SaaS of essentially open-source components.  Actually I have this problem with EC2 and S3 in general to some extent, though much less so than with Heroku because the markup is lower and I've still got a large degree of control.<p>The benefit of Heroku is that they maintain an up-to-date and well-tuned Rails stack w/ add-ons on top of EC2.  There is definitely value there.  But in all cases there is this downside of overhead and flexibility.  The clincher for me is that ultimately Heroku may end up not supporting something I need that would be trivial open-source stuff on any UNIX VPS.  At that point I will need to migrate off of Heroku and all those supposed sysadmin costs hit me full in the face all at once rather than being amortized over the life of the project.  Maybe I'm just turning into a cranky old man (at 31!), but VPS or dedicated servers still seem like a better value considering all risk factors.

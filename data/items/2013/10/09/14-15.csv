Disk drives will report that content is safely on persistent media as soon as it reaches the track buffer and before actually being written to oxide. This makes the disk drives seem to operate faster (which is vitally important to the manufacturer so that they can show good benchmark numbers in trade magazines). And in fairness, the lie normally causes no harm, as long as there is no power loss or hard reset prior to the track buffer actually being written to oxide. But if a power loss or hard reset does occur, and if that results in content that was written after a sync reaching oxide while content written before the sync is still in a track buffer, then database corruption can occur.<p> part of me hopes there&#x27;s a very special hell for the people making disks where the OS can never be sure if the data is safe or not.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html</a>",1381330755

6521618,comment,6521308,6521308,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"Have you talked to anyone about your product? Have you gotten any feedback about it? Do you believe it stands a reasonable chance of success if you devoted your full(er) attention to it? Getting feedback and product/market fit validation is relatively inexpensive. On the other hand, dropping everything to work on an unvalidated product can be quite costly.<p>I would recommend seeking out as much feedback as possible -- not just from friends & family, but from people on the street, people in your hypothetical target market, Show/Ask HN posts, meetups, etc. Look before you leap. While you can never fully mitigate the risk of starting your own business, you can certainly get your ducks in a row before jumping completely into it.<p>Maybe the product you want to build will never get built unless you devote 50%, 60%, or even 100% of your time to it. That&#x27;s fair. But before you do that, prove the <i>concept</i>. Nothing is more heartbreaking that dropping a secure, comfortable job to leap into a project you haven&#x27;t rigorously vetted and tested. Trust me; I&#x27;ve done that before. It didn&#x27;t end well, and it set me back at least a couple of years.<p>One should never <i>have</i> to make a &quot;cold turkey&quot; move. Nothing about it should be cold. If you&#x27;re giving up a good job to pursue something else, you owe it to yourself to make sure that something else might be viable. Instead of spending your 3-5% nights-and-weekends time building small chunks of the product, use that time to test the concept and the market.",1381330743

For better and for worse, flogging would air the dirty laundry of race and punishment in America in a way that prisonswhich, by their very design, are removed from societycan never do. To highlight an injustice is in no way to condone it. Quite the opposite.<p>Without a radical defense of flogging, changes to our current defective system of justice are hard to imagine. The glacial pace of reform promises only the most minor adjustments to the massive machinery of incarceration. Bringing back the lash is one way to destroy itif not completely, then at least for the millions of Americans for whom the punishment of prison is far, far worse than the crime they have committed. Yes, flogging may seem brutal and retrograde, but only because we are in mass denial about the greater brutality of our supposedly civilized and progressive prisons. &quot;",1381330571

In the US, it&#x27;s 3 hours minimum, and that&#x27;s assuming you get in.<p>* Crappy legislation and tax. Your tax codes suck. Starting a business sucks. In the UK, fill in a single bit of paper, and pay your corporation tax when it&#x27;s due. Flat percentage of income, two rates, one for most businesses, one for huge businesses. Don&#x27;t get me started on the strength of behemoth corporate interests lobbies.<p>* Crappy businesses. The American way seems to be to hold a gun to your &quot;partners&#x27;&quot; heads, and use lawyers to enact your will. In Europe, people actually tend to trust one another.<p>* Crappy security. By this I mean not &quot;THERE SHOULD BE MORE POLICE&quot;, but rather  &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I can run a business in the US without the state meddling, and/or simply taking it away from me, and/or the state collapsing leaving mayhem both for a business and for anyone stuck out there when the brown stuff hits the whirly thing.&quot;.<p>I just don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want to either start a business in the US, or do business with the US.

When I see a lower case symbol used like a function I expect it&#x27;s an actual function. And then comes the day I want to take the address of the &quot;function&quot; and it fails. Or worse, I make a syntax error somewhere and because of the macro expansion it gives me the most perplexing error message in the world and it takes me 5 minutes and digging through 4 levels of include files to realize I forgot a colon or something.<p>Not to mention the mess if the macro is poorly implemented and does things like using a parameter several times which causes hard to catch undefined behaviours in the application.  Nothing worse than having a seemingly harmless code like &quot;foo(a++)&quot; turn into the bug of doom because you didn&#x27;t know foo was a macro.

You can compute during the retrace intervals.  So thats the $2 market.<p>One of the most successful / popular / bug free uses of the Propeller chip is as a graphics coprocessor outputting analog VGA, it does quite a good job of that.  The electronics for the prop-vga connection are some peculiar value resistors, and a VGA jack, little else.  So thats the $10 market.<p>If you want something more advanced than a prop as a graphics copro, you use a $25 rasp-pi.<p>Much above $25 and you&#x27;re looking at little embedded PCs/home theater PCs.  Look at what the mythtv guys are using for frontends, which over the last decade or so has gone from pretty exotic to boring COTS, for a couple hundred $.<p>So its a market that&#x27;s fuller than you know and has had historical issues.<p>To some extent you run into problems with &quot;maker&quot; class processors such as memory limitations.  If you want monochrome full VGA and your arduino only has 2 K of ram or whatever it is (its probably 2 ords magnitude too low whatever the exact spec is) you&#x27;re not going to be doing a simple frame buffer.

The golden mean between the extremes is to use imprisonment only on convicted criminals who are proven dangerous when out in free society, and to use noncustodial sentences (community service and the like) for convicted criminals who are not particularly dangerous. Minnesota, where I live, does this. Minnesota pioneered determinate sentencing based on severity of the crime and the offender&#x27;s criminal history[1] and Minnesota has three decades of history with declining to imprison minor drug offenders.[2] A sentencing guidelines system[3] could do a lot in many states to reduce the number of convicted criminals actually sentenced to prison, while making conditions inside the prisons more humane. (Minnesota spends more per prisoner than almost any other state, while spending LESS per taxpayer than almost any other state on its prison system. Many of the worst conditions of prison systems in other states are simply nonexistent in Minnesota.)<p>I live in a crime-free, safe neighborhood such that my children can roam freely for miles from my home without worries. My neighbors and I are confident that a truly dangerous criminal will be apprehended and kept out of society if need be. Young people who fool around with illegal drugs will be diverted to drug treatment programs, but are exceedingly unlikely to face prison time here. We apply criminal punishments to dangerous criminals, and try our best to help everyone straighten out their lives after interaction with the criminal justice system.

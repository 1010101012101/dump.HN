But for Kleiner a 15mil acquisition of a portfolio company doesn't necessarily get them jumping. <p>",1176072260

We're a competitor to ASP.NET Ajax and we're not even afraid of them!
Sure they've got like 10 000 more downloads per month than us, but their product quality sucks to such an extent we think they've with purpose built it bad just to make sure it's good enough for developers to embrace it but bad enough it'll take ten years to build Office with it!
Someone at MS once said; ""for someone to take the lead over MS today means MS must 'bend over' and let themself become the IBM version 2.0"", well that's just what they're doing in these days! And we're here to ""plug"" them!! ;)<p>PS!

There's been a single issue I was unhappy about, which was a mandatory IP change for my box due to a reconfiguration of their network (after they were bought by peer1, a fiber/bandwidth company).<p>All else has been nigh on perfect.  They do expect that you'll handle everything yourself that can be handled remotely, though I wouldn't think that was a problem in this crowd. :)<p>Edit: Er, and if you do choose to go with them, email me for a discount code if you want one.",1176071678

Does anyone know of a cheap colo in Boston/SanFran that will rent you 1U at a time?",1176070463
10528,comment,10528,9770,0,0,IamDavo,,,"Agree. I now laugh when I hear the Softies talk about how MS is competing with Google.  That game is over. Google does not need to compete with MS, but MS must compete with Google. It is also sad to see their current ad campaign with the dinosaurs...do they even see what they are doing?  I went back to Mac 4 years ago and have never looked back. I am am one app away from being completely Microsoft free!<p>If they did not have so much cash I would short the stock.<p>Davo

This food chain will make everyone happy. I dont know if it would go as planned but still whats there to try :-)<p>So there is lot of money in getting small startup companies into advertising and web 2.0 is just a beginning. If someone thinks google adsense is ultimate product, there are flaws and once can correct this and still make ad revenue.",1176070300

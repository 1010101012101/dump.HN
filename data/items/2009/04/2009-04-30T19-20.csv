One description of the singularity is that it's when the maximum intelligence of an agent (human, computer, whatever) begins to significantly increase due to increasing computing power.  If we're using that definition, then it fits with your ""saturation point"" description, since we'd be increasing the amount of information that an agent can handle.  The ""singularity"" aspect is from the perspective of an unmodified human, not the upgraded agents themselves.<p>But there are other definitions.  :)",1241121517

If people do not like it, their avenue is to elect representatives who will legislate a different more restrictive framework.

To return to finance, the last economic depression in the United States that did not result in massive government intervention was the collapse of 1920–21. It was sharp but short, and entailed the sort of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” that could lead to a real boom. The decade that followed — the roaring 1920s — was so strong that historians have forgotten the depression that started it. The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.""<p>is just terrible.  ""[T]he extension of the franchise to women ... [has] rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.""<p>Even the most generous interpretation of that sentence is very illiberal.  Well, if they don't agree with us and we're right, maybe they just shouldn't be allowed vote.  They obviously don't know what's best for themselves, those women and welfare beneficiaries.  Really?<p>And also is the 1920s really the decade we want to hold up as the last great decade in America?<p>The whole article swings violently between utopianism and nihilism.

The who's who of Lisp.

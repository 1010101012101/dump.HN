Why?<p>1) My story (mike's too) got on the front page and had some decent discussion.  I think 15-20% of uniques reading a featured story is a reasonable estimate.<p>2) The site is about news and community, so it doesn't make much sense to check infrequently.  I'd guess that the uniques/week isn't much below the uniques/month.  So it wouldn't matter that the story didn't stay up for a long time.<p>3) The leaderboard goes up to the top 50, with karma dropping by about 100 per 5 spots towards the end.  If you take the rule of thumb that 90% just read, 9% contribute a little, and 1% contribute a lot, then if the top 1% is 50 people, you get 5,000.  If it's 70 people, then you get 7,000. I recognize most of the names on the top 50, and I bet I'd recognize half of the top 51-100.  So again, 5,000-7,000.<p>pg, care to give some guidance?",1201198436

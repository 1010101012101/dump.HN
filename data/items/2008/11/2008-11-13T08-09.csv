I had to install Quicktime a while back on Windows to convert some weird-format Quicktime YUV files to something usable--it instacrashed upon trying to convert it.  After reinstalling a few times it worked, but it took over 2 hours to <i>start the conversion</i>.  This was a conversion from raw YUV to raw BMP.  Oh, and then it took about 2 days to do the conversion for a single film.  Seriously, folks.<p>I've constantly heard its much better under OS X; but at least my experience on Windows says its not merely bad, but the single worst media player I have ever used (yes, worse than Real.)",1226566774

I already explained this in the first post in this thread and also in the previous thread.<p>Look, there are lots of sub-topics to deal with in this project, and the previous thread was totally messed up and disorganized -- meaning I couldn't follow any of the sub-topics effectively.  That's why I re-posted some of the comments in separate posts in this thread ... so I can continue to discuss them in a clearer and easier to follow manner.<p>Is there something wrong with doing this that I'm not aware of?",1226565239

I see tails. Don't you ? And this tail can be long.<p>The real question is whether it is possible to build a viable business by exploiting the tail. From what I understood this depends on two things: 1° on the benefit you can make by exploiting the tail, 2° on securing it against the businesses exploiting the belly of the curve.<p>What Will Page tells us is that the tail is a starving zone. Since he works for the belly business he simply tells us that the second rule applies. Whether the first rule apply depends on the costs and benefits which may vary greatly with the business model considered.<p>Once again the Register demonstrates a lack of common sense.",1226565122

362870,comment,362758,362796,0,0,silencio,,,"I couldn't help but notice that almost your entire second to last paragraph sounds nearly identical to the current iPhones and iPod touches.<p>Anyway, the only reason why I keep coming back to the iPod rather than any other player in the market is because of its usability, not because of the hardware and generally not because of the design. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it is drop dead simple to figure out how to use, partially since it doesn't have a dozen buttons just to control playback.<p>I feel that maybe the rest of the competitors (after all, there is also iriver, cowon etc. that are willing to spend the R&D money on new designs since they are in a market (south korea) where iPods and Apple do not dominate as much) just overthink things, and underestimate the now fairly significant tie-in most people encounter if they purchased significant amounts of DRM'd media from the iTunes store. Hopefully the latter will decrease as there's growing demand for unlocked music, but the former...I have a neighbor who insisted on buying a portable CD player, and you have no idea how complicated it can get. I about wanted to give up after staring at a recent Sony one that had, like I said, a dozen buttons just for playback. She eventually caved in and got an iPod nano, which she was able to figure out without reading any manual.",1226564729

362865,comment,361738,362844,0,0,yters,,,"Shannon's information is a measure of the size of a set that an element is selected from, is that right?  So a letter conveys log2(26) bits of information.  That alone doesn't allow me to discriminate between the information content of a random string and an English sentence, since both supposedly contain the same amount of information by this bare metric.<p>If I look at the occurrence of subsets of the string, then that would be a better discriminator: the random string's subsets should follow a normal distribution while the English string's subsets will be highly skewed.<p>However, that doesn't work when I try to discriminate between an English string and a string generated by a simple algorithm, since the latter's subset distribution will also be highly skewed.  What kind of metric discriminates the English sentence from either case?<p>Am I making sense here?  I haven't had any formal training in information theory, and my brain is kind of fried right now.",1226563880

362860,comment,362691,362691,0,0,nostrademons,,,"9.) What would each cofounder rather be doing, if they could do anything at all in the world?<p>This was an issue with my last startup.  We started with 5 founders, but for 3 of them, the answer was ""my day job"", and we had to get rid of them at an early stage.  My other cofounder was very upfront with me from the beginning - he was all in with this particular startup, <i>unless</i> he got into Stanford or Harvard Business School.  Well, he got into Harvard, and that was the end of that partnership.  For me - I probably would not have abandoned my partner, but once he'd already left, I folded the startup when I had the chance to work with a YC startup, even though I didn't end up taking the cofounder position with them.<p>10.) What're your expectations regarding the amount of pressure you'll be putting on yourselves?<p>This is more than just working hours - it's also how seriously you beat yourselves up when you miss a deadline or things don't go your way.  It's really important to find someone who's compatible with you on this; a laid-back person and a neurotic one working together tends to lead to a lot of conflict.<p>Windows auto-update is kicking me off now, but I may think of more in the morning.",1226563633
362859,comment,362577,362745,0,0,vlad,,,"WAV is more appropriately the audio version of BMP: both try to store all the data they know about.<p>MP3 is the audio version of JPEG: both can be set to keep to a certain standard of quality, preserving what the algorithms detect are the most noticeable and important features of the media to a higher standard than less important features.<p>For GIF, I guess MIDI (musical notes) would be the audio version because GIF's generate very small files when there are few colors in an image, just like MIDI's are typically very small files, and can be used when the entire song is made up of only basic notes and instruments (no sound effects, post-processing, and you don't care if quite important notes sound different and generic, just like gif's can also make the colors different to fit the color space and lose detail.)  Both try to describe their media about as succinctly as possible (i.e. smallest file size), and therefore both can be misused when the user expects to retain fine details of the original piece of work when converting to those formats.<p>New formats have been invented or appropriated since these came out, and I could be wrong about everything, but I think this is still useful info.",1226563484

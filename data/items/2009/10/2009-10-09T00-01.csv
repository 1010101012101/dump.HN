Type in a url: you navigate to that url. Type in a search string: you navigate to the search (using google or whatever search provider you designate) for that string.<p>I'm not sure if this is pre-release chrome 4.0 specific or not, but when you visit different sites (wikipedia, amazon, youtube, stackoverflow, etc.) the first time you perform a search on those sites they are automagically registered in your browser as available search engines. Then, to search those sites specifically direct from the address bar you simply start typing part of the site name/url, hit tab to autocomplete the search provider (much in the way the awesome bar works in firefox), type your search terms and hit the enter key. Thus, 'wiki+tab+napsack problem+enter' takes you to the wikipedia article on the napsack problem, and 'yout+tab+keyboard cat+enter' searches youtube for ""keyboard cat"" videos, and 'ama+tab+coders at work+enter' searches amazon for ""coders at work"".

870326,story,,,3,5,tiredofrenting,"Ask HN: paying rent and bootstrapping - what alternatives are there?",,"Hi everyone,<p>I run a company with a core product that is bootstrapped and a bit more than ramen-profitable. We are a small fish in a big market. Our customers love us, but business is growing slowly since other players dominate distribution channels and we are only slowly starting to change that. I've thought about taking investment to try and grow faster, but it doesn't seem like a great move without a solid plan for converting cash into revenue. And I'm concerned that the need to return multiples on any investment would screw our existing business if we weren't able to push beyond slow organic growth. So current strategy is pouring all income back into the company and trying to grow existing and new product lines with the cash we have. In short: more bootstrapping.<p>Here's the rub: I'm running this business from a rented apartment that is large enough to host the people I have who come over at times and has certain kinds of other dedicated space necessary for the business.  I sleep in a room in the back so it doubles as an apartment. There aren't zoning problems with any of this, but paying rent every month grates. Surely there's a better way. I've started wondering if it would make sense to look for investment to buy a place and pledge the property as collateral to the investor? That would free up cash on our side, and reduce the downside risk to any investor. Sort of like dealing with a bank, only without the bank, and with an equity stake or convertible loan taking the place of what would be the interest payment.<p>Has anyone gone down this road for purchasing housing or other fixed assets? As a bootstrapped startup? I've never heard of anyone doing anything like this and don't know if that's because it's a patently stupid idea, because it isn't a common growth scenario, because the market is covered by existing mortgage products, or because angels are generally disinterested in this sort of thing. How off the wall is the idea and are there any better ones? How do I stop paying rent, or at least get a better deal for it?",1255048396

870292,comment,870221,870271,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think I was unclear. Student agile and big-corp agile can have a lot in common.<p>In really large organizations, developers can be multi-allocated to several different development teams and be working on 5 or 6 projects at the same time. In addition, slipping schedules is the norm. And you can have multiple channels of managers, making accountability problematic. So the stressors don't always apply at big companies either.<p>That's why I use the startup metaphor. In the startup world, you produce value or you die.<p>There are techniques to use, of course. You can insist on daily stand-ups and an hour or two of co-located time per day -- to the point of refusing to be on the team if it's not done. But that gets into a whole other area of courage and agile teams which is probably another thread.",1255046755

You probably just need a paper that says that whoever's leaving did own the IP put into the start-up and that they're transferring all their rights to the company. Investors like to know that you own what you're selling...",1255046668

However, one founder decides they don't want to pursue the idea (let's say grad school comes up or something) but is happy for the other founder to continue with the idea.<p>I assume it's good to sign some documents saying that the leaving founder surrenders all claims to the startup, implementation ideas etc.?  What about from a future competition standpoint too, would the surrender of rights to the ideas be enough to stop those ideas being used at a later date?<p>I'd love your thoughts.",1255046530

965007,comment,964697,964845,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I've interviewed with plenty of financial firms (large banks, asset management companies, smaller trading software firms, etc.) for engineer positions. The interviews are focused more on concurrency primitives, language features (knowing your tools), and database features (it's just too important in the financial world), with a bit of puzzles and basic computer science thrown in. It's not super hard, but it's also not a walk in the park. The questions are slightly different because of a different culture, but I can't say that it's radically different from a tech company interview, nor is it significantly easier.",1259402331

In that misconception, many common coding errors lie.<p>For example, you might think that reversing a string is equivalent to reversing its characters. It's not.<p>Similarly, you might think that indexing a string is the same as indexing a list. It's not.<p>Etc etc.",1259402213

It's only a question of time until somebody comes up with the idea to aggregate all the meaningless karma across many sites. And it's only a question of time until that super karma score is quoted on your resume together with how many ""followers"", ""friends"" or other kind of nonsensical internet money you have accumulated ... by hook or crook.<p>Gaining insight, asking questions, having a debate, making judgements, pushing an agenda, feeling good about judging others without making a case for or against anything. These things all get mixed up relentlessly in these primitive voting schemes.<p>And not even the smart people who make this website seem to realise what an intellectual mess their Frankenstein game theory is. Or maybe they do but still think it's worth it.<p>I disagree. The filtering effect of all these voting schemes is next to worthless. It creates more perverse incentives than positive ones. It's getting totally out of control. Millions of people are morphing into one man/woman cynical self marketing machines collecting fake internet money.<p>I'm waiting for the world's first karma inflation crisis :-)",1259402183

Welcome to the way things are, I'm afraid.<p>And, frankly, I don't have the expertise to <i>actually</i> engage the debate on its merits, and neither do most people who take positions on the issue, so you'll have to forgive me if I assume most people with strong opinions on the matter have those opinions because of group identity.<p>But, try this: stop and look around at your <i>real</i> peer group, people whose opinions you respect, whose moral values you share, whose political perspectives you agree with. If you find that you and they have in common many beliefs about contentious issues of a <i>factual nature</i>... you might want to stop and think about why that might be the case.",1259401916

I just graduated from school and let me tell you that the real brain drain is in our smartest students defecting to finance.<p>Why would someone with a 4.0 in a hard, rigorous subject go into engineering for a measly 60k a year starting salary + 20% raises when he can work in a finance industry where the top talent makes in the hundreds?<p>I had a lot of friends in the math department that were double business majors. I imagine that at least for quantitive finance positions, interviews such as these (if not way harder) are a must to separate the top talent from the elite talent.",1259401844
964997,comment,964829,964932,0,0,patio11,,,"I suppose that is possible, but consumer gas consumption is mostly non-elastic (i.e. does not change with the price).  We saw this during the price spikes a few years ago.  It doesn't strike me as likely that it would suddenly get elastic when moving downwards.<p>This is assuming for the sake of argument that hybrids are cheaper per mile.  The thing that makes that claim difficult to evaluate is ""Cheaper than what"".  There are several plausible candidates for a yardstick which make the claim catastrophically false.  (Gas is a fraction of the cost per mile.  People notice it because they don't remember ever not having a $350 car payment and don't consider the cost-per-mile that was rolled into that.)",1259401713
964995,comment,964829,964829,0,0,jsz0,,,"Modern gasoline compacts with small engines are very quiet at city speeds. Even on an empty street you wouldn't hear a huge difference. Tires on pavement would be an audible constant for both. On a busy street with other background noise it would be nearly impossible to distinguish the two. Certainly there's an audible difference between a hybrid and a diesel truck but you'd assume people stopped relying on audible warnings with the advent of quiet gasoline cars.<p>I think it's more likely that hybrids change the way some people drive. The peppy stop & go performance, combined with good braking performance, might make people more daring, more likely to accelerate quickly, more likely to rely on short stopping. This is exactly why insurance rates on sporty or high performance cars is higher than an under powered station wagon. Your choice of car changes the way you drive. If this is true it's likely that quiet gasoline compacts with good acceleration would also cause a higher number of accidents involving pedestrians.",1259401151

964991,comment,964665,964918,0,0,voidpointer,,,"Well put.<p>There are far more relevant points, such as the fact that the fudged data series isn't even used anywhere in the rest of the program. The code fragment is indeed pretty useless without the entire program. It seems like ESR has stopped looking at the code once he thought he had found what he was looking for. The adjusted data is never referenced in the rest of the program: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=964896"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=964896</a><p>Ideally we would have access to the entire program + data and could re-run it to see whether the graph was produced with or without the adjustments enabled. It is very well possible that the program was altered after the graph was plotted and before that version of the source became public.",1259400619
964990,comment,964665,964918,0,0,trominos,,,"He is certainly attacking ESR's character, but I think that the old mantra that we should always address an argument and not the person delivering it isn't entirely fair. The strongest reason for this, in my opinion, is that most complex systems can't be thoroughly analyzed with any objectivity, because it's impossible to consciously process all the available data; there's just too much going on. So whenever somebody argues about a complex system, there's a very implicit part of their argument that involves <i>which data they choose to present</i>. A bystander who's trying to follow (and validate or invalidate) a logical argument can't always tell if the choice of data is unbiased, and of course looking at <i>all</i> available data takes the bystander as much time as it took the arguer to formulate the argument in the first place.<p>So USUALLY what an unbiased observer will do is proceed with caution: see what the arguer's point is, see how it fits with the observer's intuition (because this is the same as appealing to the observer's subconscious, which in most cases has processed far more data relevant to some issue than has their conscious mind), and see whether the data seems overwhelming enough that its conclusion <i>couldn't</i> be the result of biased data selection on the part of the arguer. But this method often fails. Without formulating your own opinion by immersing yourself in data, you just can't be sure whether you're looking at a legitimate picture of an issue. That's why whenever I hear a convincing argument about something complex, I only provisionally believe whatever I've just been convinced of. And that's why an argument's author actually matters if the argument relates to a sufficiently complex system.<p>Now, arguments about simple (by which I really mean ""completely specified"") systems aren't victim to this weakness -- mathematical proof, for instance, can actually be really verified by an observer without the observer doing the same work that the discover did, as can many logical arguments in the hard sciences.<p>But what ESR is trying to show here is that some particular set of scientists committed scientific fraud. This is a) a value judgment and b) depends substantially on context.<p>So I think that it is not only reasonable but very much a <i>good</i> thing that ieure pointed out that ESR is a nutjob. Now I know that even if I find his post compelling, he has no intellectual honesty and the data he's showing me have been carefully selected from the unimaginably vast amounts of data in the world because they happen to support his worldview. Maybe he's still right -- but ieure's post is still very much relevant.",1259400546
964989,comment,964665,964912,0,0,camccann,,,"With all due respect, if you're going to take ESR to task for being politically biased and point out his use of right-wing catchphrases, you slightly undermine your point by using the term ""teabagger"".<p>...not to say that ESR <i>isn't</i> detached from anything resembling reality, but responding in kind isn't terribly helpful.",1259400503
964988,comment,964665,964972,0,0,spamizbad,,,"Considering the variable produced by code in question is never used, as shown by two comments in this thread, indicates to me that ESR is wrong.<p>Which is odd, because ESR is an expert programmer, so one would assume he'd check to see if this was a case of dead code.

I think that as drive sizes continue to grow, and with cloud-sourced backups, more stuff will simply be automatically translated.  And most personal photos and writings are already lost, and always have been.  More will almost certainly be saved in the future, not least because digital photos are shareable and copiable at minimal cost unlike the past.  Print photos and handwritten journals were far too expensive to copy, and were expensive to store and move, most were lost every generation.<p>Hacker News is the last place I would have expected to have to defend the obvious improvements available in digital media.",1259400259

I do expect to be surprised occasionally by the articles that make the front page.  I do expect there to be articles I hate, and continue to hate after reading them, and I do expect that there are articles for which I change my mind and learn something.<p>What I didn't expect was for people to down-mod me heavily simply for expressing an opinion that was different to theirs.  I thought people would ignore or reply.  I have always regarded down-modding as reserved for things that don't belong here, and I thought legitimate questioning does belong here.<p>Clearly I was wrong.  The conclusion is that people down-mud me purely because they disagreed, and couldn't be bothered to articulate their reasons.  That's why I'm disappointed, and feeling set upon.<p>I had hoped and expected that people would value contributions, even if the opinions expressed differed from their own.  I thought the article was a complete waste of time, said so, and honestly asked why people thought otherwise.  For that I got hammered.<p>I'm disappointed.<p>It won't stop me from reading and contributing, but it has made me stop and reconsider some things.

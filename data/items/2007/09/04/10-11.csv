Java is a programming language that gets compiled to bytecodes, and the JVM is an execution environment that runs bytecodes.  (There is some java-language-ish stuff in the bytecode spec, but for the most part you can treat them separately).<p>In my opinion, Java is a clumsy language but the JVM is awesome.  Static typing and lack of first-class functions or easy data types make Java programs verbose and annoying to change.  The JVM, on the other hand, is fast, portable, well-specified, and there are a ton of libraries that run on it.<p>To have the best of both worlds, you can use the JVM to run a more dynamic language (not Java)!  There are many projects to bring different languages to the JVM, but my favorite is Rhino, which compiles JavaScript to bytecodes.  Rhino is also what powers my favorite web framework, Helma.",1188902409

For example, on radioblogclub.com you can search for artists or songs you know and you end up with a playlist you can listen to online. After you've listened to what you were looking for, you can keep listening the playlist and discover similar stuff.<p>Web radios are great, too. A favorite of mine is www.scenemusic.net (old-school demoscene music).",1188902272

Groovy is okay, but not -that- great. I'd go with jython or jruby instead if you're thinking of using Groovy.<p>Scala is absolutely great. It's my favourite language. tipit's server side isn't Scala based only because I wasn't fully aware of Scala when we started out. Scala is functional in theory but even with a very imperative background you can write your code and slowly get used to solving problems 'the functional way', which does come off a bit cleaner (e.g. using case classes).\n",1188901999

It's important to know what the CIA is doing; after all, they have a track record of doing nasty things all over the world... The NSA spy on you, why don't spy on them?",1188901695

Four years later, we have a mid-size application (80K lines) that operates well and is attracting more clients, though I often feel we have stepped into a few 'pits of despair' while building it.  There are several 1500-line servlets which grind away on certain tasks, for example.<p>The upside is, we are now putting out our I18N'ed version of the product and it was very easy to produce a version of the app in a Unicode-based language, which will probably land us several more clients this year.<p>In short, Java can be great and there are a lot of things out there to help you build an app, but it only works as long as you keep the code clean and exercise your own discipline to keep from getting too sloppy.  Otherwise, you can wind up with code that needs a rewrite from day one.",1188900973

The headline deserves note because the proof is by a 20-yo but the post doesn't do him justice.<p>Interesting nevertheless and I hope to get to read more news about the author.",1193237963
72073,comment,71967,71967,0,0,Goladus,,,"Some things I like about C:<p>'void' means an empty parameter list, a function that returns no result, or a pointer to anything.<p>There is an array type, which you declare with brackets[10].  It's a real type on par with all the other real types in the language.  Yet, accessing the values in an array is done exclusively via pointer arithmetic.<p>int foo(); declares a function with unspecified parameters, unless it is C++ where it means no parameters.<p><p><p><p><p><pre><code>       char x[5] = ""Hello""; //Is an array of 5 chars, and has no string-terminator\n       char x[] = ""Hello""; //Is an array of 6 chars, with string terminator.\n</code></pre>\nYou can declare functions that take matrices of variable size, but only in one dimension.  int bar(char mat[][4][5]); Unless you're using variable-length arrays which were added to C in 1999, but aren't widely supported in compilers.",1193237952

72064,comment,71599,72009,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I have in fact never read any of these, and have honestly only heard of The World is Flat (by way of the entire shelf at Border's once dedicated to it).<p>I'm not saying I would never read them however. In fact, I just added How to Win Friends and Influence People to my list, after several recommendations I saw for it here as well as from a friend.<p>What I am saying is that roughly all books start at zero in my mind, and get positive points whenever they are recommended to me by people I know or respect. A listing on the NYT list is like getting -5 points. (FWIW, Oprah's Book Club is more like -10.)<p>I'm not saying everyone should choose their books like I do, but that is what works for me. I would like to say that any book that deals with current politics or current leaders is nothing more than thinly veiled marketing, and no one is missing out by not reading those. Real history has to be written after the fact, and I'm sure that when it is, I will enjoy it, but no book about a current candidate will be anything more than another campaign outlet.<p>Edit: Oh and I almost forgot... everything I just said aside, I often do resist reading a book that I know I will enjoy just to be different (like Harry Potter, which I'm avoiding for another decade). It's not a crime to avoid the herd, and I'm sure everyone does it in their own way. It's hard to think for yourself, if you do not question authority (of the masses)... to paraphrase one of my favorite quotes.",1193236905

72061,comment,72031,72031,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"This is why I hate Seeking Alpha: they can stretch a factual sentence (""Google is overpriced, given their P/E of X, because a fair P/E is Y."") into a whole article -- with fewer actual facts. I like how, for illustration, they (almost!) told us Google's past growth rate. That to defend the statement that ""Although this exponentially growing income is really unprecedented it is a huge mistake to assume it can continue.""<p>Thanks. Everyone I know who owns Google stock also thinks their growth rate will be exactly has high in the future as it was in the past. We all expect GOOG's market share to hit 47291% in a decade.<p>Did the writer just not bother to consider his assumptions? Look at a chart of Google's stock price and P/E: <a href=""http://www.byrneseyeview.com/pictures/googwithpe.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.byrneseyeview.com/pictures/googwithpe.gif</a><p>Their earnings are going up <i>faster</i> than their price. If investors think Google's growth rate is this high permanently, why has the stock's P/E dropped about 70% from peak?<p>""It is my contention not that Google is necessarily overvalued, but only that investors in the stock at these levels, if they think it is not overvalued, must realize what they are conjecturing as to the company's growth.""<p>Thanks. So it might be expensive. And it might not. And investors should keep that in mind. Yes, that's what he's saying: investors should be aware that buying Google is not necessarily as safe as just keeping their money in cash.<p>""Let us think about what the current implicit future growth rate suggests about the dominance of this company in our economy. Within ten years, Google will be earning as much or more than over half of the Dow 30 components.""<p>He doesn't defend this math, so I have no idea where he gets that idea. I have little trouble believing it, if true: Google already earns more than some Dow components ($4 billion for the last 12 months; Alcoa has around half that). But I don't see why Google must achieve this growth to be worth its current price: as long as investors continue to expect steady above-average growth, Google will have a long-term P/E higher than most.<p>""Where such capital can be deployed in the virtual world in which Google operates is not readily apparent to me.""<p>Oh, good! Google operates in a 'virtual world'! Clearly they buy their servers for Linden Dollars and Flooz.<p>Full disclosure: I agree with the author's conclusion that Google is probably overpriced. But I've thought so since it was at $150.",1193236405

 * vitamin D deficieny
 * sub-clinical hypothyroidism
 * blood sugar issues

3348444,comment,3347828,3347828,10,0,aaronf,,,"As a seller on Amazon, do not expect the same level of service and efficiency you receive as a buyer. I had a client selling on Amazon that had all kinds of surprises. On one occasion, they took down listings because the product was selling too well - it took days to resolve, and the launch's momentum was killed.<p>Here's the key to getting these issues resolved:
1) Always use phone support, not email support. Email support will almost always paste the easiest reply - it may as well be automated. Phone support gets you a a real human being on the phone who will actually listen and understand what's going on.
2) Keep escalating. If they deny your appeal, appeal again. There is absolutely no consistency in how they handle these situations. One person may say there's nothing that can be done, the next will push a button and instantly make the problem go away. And the more you annoy them, the more it's worth their while to actually look at and resolve your problem.<p>Good luck.",1323799120

If you're on a language all the cool kids are using, you'll find those cool kids have an obsession with perfection. To the point where they deprecate things instantly and break everything that worked before. See NodeJS and Python for examples.<p>If you have 10K lines of code, not so bad. So you do a rewrite every year. When you have 100K lines of code or more, their obsession with perfection will destroy your business.<p>A rewrite becomes an immense undertaking. You end up running old versions. Those old versions require dependencies which require you to run old operating systems. Eventually the entire ecosystem implodes.<p>But guess what? Code that was written in PHP3 over 10 years ago works just as well today under PHP5. You can even mix and match. Does that make the syntax of the language ugly? Sure. It even encourages bad practices. So what? You're running a business, not an art gallery.

When deleting the blogpost all comments will be deleted too and cascading deletes are just not necessary.<p>Some of the other constraints you'll have to implement in your software.

Buffers share session data of the Vim instance they're in.  This has a lot of different benefits, including automatically sharing whatever options or settings have been set (many dynamically or temporarily set), sharing of Vim registers, macros, and command history, all of which are heavily used when editing (if OS handled they would generally share a single clipboard register), Vim-controlled navigation between buffers and windows, Vim-controlled scripting between multiple buffers, Vim-controlled searches of multiple buffers, and more.<p>Because there are so many benefits of having multiple buffers/files open within the same Vim instance it makes sense to have multiple buffers viewable at once, not to have only one viewable at a time. You lose a lot of editing power if buffers are not open in same Vim instance; it doesn't make sense to open a new file separately in different Vim instance.

You are correct in that Microsoft's .NET VM performs better than Mono overall (at least in the general case), but Mono does perform better than .NET in some cases.<p>Unfortunately I don't have a list of the areas where Mono outperforms .NET handy, so I can't list them here. Perhaps one of the other Mono devs can follow up and provide details. Most likely SIMD would be on the list.<p>Whether Microsoft would be interested in taking Mono's implementation for these areas or not for their own VM is questionable. Likely not, as it would likely not be easily adaptable to their implementation anyway.<p>2. SGen is actually stable these days. It is used in Mono4Android and we are working on moving MonoTouch over to SGen as well.<p>Moonlight was also being moved to SGen (it started out using Boehm because that was the default GC when the project was started) when the Novell layoffs came along.<p>As responsible developers, we have been taking our time moving to SGen as the default GC because we don't want the move to break any existing apps if we can avoid it. As with all new things, there are still likely to be bugs here and there, but overall we feel that it is ready for use and we've been eating our own dog food.<p>3.

3348298,comment,3346743,3347826,3,0,dxbydt,,,"> wish schools taught math leading to statistics and probability instead of leading to calculus<p>This is silly. All probability distributions are cadlag, so how can you even teach probability without the notion of right continous with left limits, which means you have to resort to limits & derivatives => Calc.<p>Actually, the argument for combining Calc & Stats is very compelling, because there is too much synergy. How can you teach a continous probability distribution like say the Gaussian without teaching how to integrate under the curve for the cumulative distribution function, or obtaing the probability density function via the derivative, or obtaining the variance aka second central moment via the moment generating function, which means you now have to teach atleast some fourier transforms which again means Calculus. At both UChicago & Stanford where I learnt all of my probability, calculus was quite intertwined with the teaching of probability. I believe its the same case in most other schools as well.<p>Without calc in probability, you can do ""lame"" stuff like discrete distributions ( Binomial, Poisson etc....but even there, the key insight is to show how the CDFs of the discrete distributions, which will generally have terribly complicated formulae with giant factorial expressions, can be very nicely approximated by the continous distributions for large n, small p etc. ( aka continous correction <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_correction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_correction</a> ). So for a large number of coin flips trials, you use a Normal to approximate the CDF because otherwise the original binomial CDF is too hard to compute with your TI-84s (because you have one giant factorial divided by another giant factorial and the numerical overflows will kill the computation unless you are very careful about how you go about computing the result).<p>My favorite go-to guide remains the excellent Calc & Stat Dover book ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Statistics-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486449939/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Statistics-Dover-Books-Mathem...</a> ), which combines Calc & Stats from page 1.

In two directions.<p>One, not everything is available on Kindle, so it's worth asking for suggestions from the subset of materials that are available.<p>Two, local and immediate availability.  Kindle greatly increases convenience by allowing you to have a selection of books with you much more often than you would otherwise.

You don't ""go out"" when you get chronically injured, especially these days when we have decent medical care. What happens is that you spend the rest of your life in pain.

2963415,comment,2963168,2963168,11,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"While I hate patent trolls as much as the next small technology business owner, the trolls themselves aren't the problem.<p>Completely non-novel patents being awarded by the thousands is the real problem. If the ""trolls"" were really just enforcing interesting and valid patents on behalf of individual inventors, that's one thing. But they're instead finding the most broad patents they can and using them to extort money from companies who are successful, sometimes regardless of applicability of the patent to the companies in question.<p>The fact that software can be patented at all is questionable in my opinion -- anything sufficiently complicated to be worthy of a software patent would be copyrightable. Anything less complicated should be held to an extremely high standard of novelty before being allowed a patent -- and even then I would put the time limit on such a patent at 5 years or less.<p>Just having an ""idea"" that no one has happened to already patent yet and sitting on until someone else thinks of it and implements it doesn't ""promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"", which is the underlying mission of all IP protections in the US at least.<p>The patent database is full of so much noise that no one is mining it for ideas and creating software based on it at this point; instead everyone is coming up with similar ideas, and pretty much BY DEFINITION those patents shouldn't be valid.",1315259424

2963354,comment,2963100,2963100,5,0,acangiano,,,"Functional programming is admittedly fun, at least for those who are mathematically inclined. The problem is that it's hard, at least at this stage, to justify using a functional programming language as your <i>main</i> tool.<p>Want to develop web applications? Nothing from the functional programming camp comes even close to the polished experience of using Ruby on Rails. Yes, I know about Play and other web frameworks for Scala, Clojure, and Haskell, but - and I repeat - they aren't even remotely close to the level of support, libraries, plugins, and documentation that you can get from the Rails world.<p>Want to develop mobile apps for iOS or Android? That's typically Objective-C or Java territory. Yes, you can develop Android in Scala, but you are a pioneer then (and you are virtually on your own if you encounter any issues with the stack, as very little documentation and community support is available for it).<p>Want to develop desktop applications? Again, functional programming languages are rarely the best supported option. C#, Objective-C, C++, or even Object Pascal (Delphi) are all fine choices. Opt for Scala, Clojure, or Haskell and you'll find little documentation and support, and in the case of the first two, you'll have GUIs that look anything but native.<p>So what are these functional programming languages good for? So far I've only found them to be good at doing heavy lifting in the back-end or in GUI-less scripts. An important spot for sure, but not the most prominent one to justify adopting either as my <i>main</i> tool.<p>I love functional programming languages and I wish I could drop everything and write web apps in Clojure or Haskell. But the hustler in me wants to get stuff done and cannot justify the world of pain and waste of time I'd experience, especially when there are already tools that are simply better suited for the task at hand.<p>Should a project of mine scale to the point of needing a fast functional programming language for core functionality in the back-end, I'll be happy to employ it there.",1315257078

While the form factor and natural interface is a large part of this, it is not the only reason. The closed ecosystem of iOS is big part of the success too. iPads are computers for 'everyone else' and by that I mean that you don't have to worry about malware, viruses etc: Your grandparents and my grandparents can make almost full use of these devices without constantly needing help from the likes of us.<p>It has nothing to do with iPads being trendy. Real people see them and immediately understand them. They try them and they want one too - here is the perfect device for sitting on a sofa and browsing Facebook while watching TV. They are also perfect for keeping young children occupied in a safe environment for 20 mins while you sort out your chores. This is not the case with an internet connected PC (or Mac for that matter).<p>iPads are not going away. They are not a 'trend' (by which I mean they are not a blip on a graph). Expect them to grow exponentially and for very household to get at least one.<p>Eventually, some other company will work out that it isn't just the form and the touch interface. The accessibility to a wide demographic, the safe sandbox, the vetted apps, the music+video+app+book store are all vital.<p>Whether it is Google, Amazon or Microsoft (or another) that finally crack this remains to be seen.",1315256841

That&#x27;s what you want to do when you have many instances that all need to talk to each other. Distributed means combinatorial explosion. It&#x27;s... like secondary-school-level graph theory/probability.<p>Distributed is what you want to have for a) robustness (because redundancy means the work can be redirected to agents that are still alive) and b) adaptability (because system can restructure itself locally without the need to coordinate with the entirety of it).<p>Of course you want to apply those two recursively, e.g. hierarchies that encompass many peers at each level, etc., but that doesn&#x27;t change the point. Frankly, the whole field of distributed computing is one big proof that hierarchies are good and desirable.",1450900715

The specific use case you mention - I don&#x27;t use Hue, but I have a Roku remote installed on the watch that I use all the time. It&#x27;s two taps to get to the remote. Much faster than pulling out my phone. I also love that it looks like a real watch. Most people that see it assume that it is just a regular watch, unless I start talking to it. Maybe I just have poor taste but I really don&#x27;t like the look of the iWatch - it looks like they shrunk an iPhone and strapped it to a wrist band. Which I guess is what it&#x27;s supposed to look like but not really my taste, I guess.<p>Not trying to bash Apple here I almost always recommend Apple to friends and family even though I mostly don&#x27;t use it myself, but I do think there are much better smart watches available than the iWatch.",1450900708

While there is, of course, real discrimination against women, this simply isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>The only discrimination going on here is that men are more discriminant on price than women are with broad categories of items.  I work with retail data, and I know this is 100% true.  Items marketed towards men in the &quot;Consumables&quot; category (deodorant, razors, shampoo, etc) are priced lower than their female counterparts because decades of scientific analysis has shown that men are more likely to shop for these particular products based on price than women are.<p>In economic terms, depending on the category, men and women have different price elasticity curves.<p>An interesting twist on this is that certain Men&#x27;s products within the &quot;Consumables&quot; category are at high price points due to the data showing their respective consumer group to be far less price sensitive, especially with the 18-25 male demographic with hair care products.<p>This is all data and algorithms talking, not actual discrimination.<p>Anyone with a son can also point out exactly why boy&#x27;s underwear costs more than girl&#x27;s underwear:  boys get very excited about underwear with characters on it, so parents are less price sensitive on those products.  But according to this story, this is just another form of evil discrimination towards boys wearing underroos.<p>Source:  I help my customers set prices for their product/store combinations using data.",1450900630

He slipped and one of the bricks fell directly onto the core. Daghlian said later he knew at that moment he was dead. He threw the brick off the core, but it was too late. The resulting neutron burst killed him a few weeks later.<p>Interestingly, this same core also caused the death of a second professor, Loius Slotin. Slotin was attempting to perform the same task, determining the point of supercriticality, but using a different approach.<p>In this case a beryllium sphere(!), another neutron reflector, cut into two hemispheres were slowly lowered together, and the resulting neutron levels were measured.<p>Slotin was famously reckless, and in his insanity, he developed the apparatus such that the only thing keeping the two hemispheres from completely joining and producing an immediate reaction was a flat head screwdriver he slowly twisted. Enrico Fermi said several times &quot;He&#x27;s already dead. It&#x27;s only a matter of whether others die with him.&quot;<p>Sure enough, one day Slotin slipped, the core went briefly supercritical, and the massive dose of radiation killed him.<p>A superstition developed around the core, and although it was originally slated for wartime testing, the team left it on the shelf until after the war, when it was eventually detonated in a test at Bikini Atoll.",1450900334

Depending on the company, when you buy equipment it is an expense for the company (i.e., you don&#x27;t have to pay taxes on the money used for buying the equipment).  However, you usually can&#x27;t (depending on the country/state/province/whatever) declare the entire expense in the first year.  You often get it as the value of the item depreciates.  Some countries have bizarre rules for depreciation.  For example, in Japan, you might get stuck on a <i>20 year</i> straight line depreciation for a telephone (even if it is a mobile one).  So you get 5% of the value as an expense in the first year (tax law is complicated, so I&#x27;m just giving you the worst case example -- there are cases where you can get 100% depreciation in the first year as well).<p>Anyway, each thing you buy, you have to track the depreciation of.  You can sell the used item for a loss which means more paper work.  Or you can pile the items up until they have fully depreciated.  But, basically, it is a huge pain in the back end.  If you have an accountant on staff who is already up to their eyeballs, it is not unusual for them to grumble very loudly about having to deal with the developers&#x27; obsession for new shiny toys.<p>If you have a company who is willing to throw money at problems to make them go away (don&#x27;t try to track the equipment as an expense if you don&#x27;t have the capacity to do so), then it won&#x27;t be a problem.

Its not theoretically impossible that a person who had undertaken a debt that had become unenforceable might be inclined to pay it off for social reasons that don&#x27;t rely on the legal enforceability of the debt, so it probably shouldn&#x27;t be illegal to notify and ask.<p>Perhaps then, instead of it being illegal, the collection agency (either via phone or through paper correspondence) should be required to (up front) disclose that the debt is no longer enforceable and that the debtor is not required to pay the debt back by law.<p>> There may be a good case that this should be tightened and require explicit notice of debts that are beyond the statute of limitations and not legally enforceable in collections (which would also give the collector a positive obligation to make this determination.)

You&#x27;re relying on someone&#x27;s ignorance to collect a debt.<p>> It also seems like a beneficial negotiation tactic for the consumer. Some states have an SOL well below the ~7-year period where it falls off your credit report. So if I live in Louisiana with a 3-year SOL on consumer debt and someone tries to collect a 4-year-old debt, pay-for-delete obviously becomes a much more likely scenario. My credit goes up a lot with the removal of a delinquent account, and the collector makes money off something I could otherwise ignore without penalty.<p>Again, you&#x27;re assuming a shred and educated citizen who is attempting to use a loophole (pay-to-delete, which violates a collector&#x27;s agreement with all three credit reporting agencies).<p>No. Asking someone to pay after the SOL has passed as the debt is time barred is tantamount to fraud. I&#x27;ve already placed called to Senator Warren&#x27;s office, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",1450898847

Further, the FDCPA prohibits mischaracterizing &quot;the character, amount, <i>or legal status</i> of any debt&quot; and a variety of other false representations or implications; I can&#x27;t imagine that collection of a legally-unenforceable debt is generally attempted without prohibited false representations and/or implications as to consequences of non-payment.

That&#x27;s very different from saying that they deliberately built a backdoor into the system, and I think that some of the things they&#x27;ve done (like explicitly noting when someone else has been added to your iCloud account, and will be able to decrypt upcoming iMessage messages) goes to some length to mitigate those issues, and make clear that the existing design is more incompetence than malice.<p>That said, all Apple would have to do to fix this is to allow advanced users to see all keys listed as authorized for their account.

You have a bit more understanding of your structure, better names and concepts behind things (types = units, for instance). You&#x27;re still operating on bits, but now most of those bits have a specifically, language encoded, meaning.<p>Haskell = calculus.

OO is not inherently more or less expressive than functional languages, it depends on the feature set of the OO and functional languages. Smalltalk is very expressive, easily comparable to the more expressive functional languages. Java, as it used to be, not familiar with developments post adding generics so I&#x27;m really rusty on it, was not so expressive. So a comparison between Smalltalk and Common Lisp would put them on a similar level of abstraction.

If you touch a debt (e.g. make a partial payment) it resets the SOL, so it seems there&#x27;s precedent that a debt past its SOL is still a valid debt.<p>It also seems like a beneficial negotiation tactic for the consumer. Some states have an SOL well below the ~7-year period where it falls off your credit report. So if I live in Louisiana with a 3-year SOL on consumer debt and someone tries to collect a 4-year-old debt, pay-for-delete obviously becomes a much more likely scenario. My credit goes up a lot with the removal of a delinquent account, and the collector makes money off something I could otherwise ignore without penalty.",1450897527

The ML family and Haskell type systems occupy a pretty nice place on the spectrum of expressiveness in that there&#x27;s not much you can add to them without losing the ability to infer unique types.  As long as your types are on the same level of complexity as a Haskell or ML type, you can typically get away with minimal type annotations - a bit more than ML or Haskell would&#x27;ve required, but not a lot more.  When you introduce more complex quantifiers such as the &quot;exists&quot; in these examples, in practice you have to start thinking about &quot;what the compiler knows&quot; and how to help it know the things you want it to.<p>There are some systems such as Coq that use heuristics (and let you write your own new heuristics) to try to automatically find proofs, and interactive sessions in which you guide the system to the proof by suggesting tactics that move hypotheses toward goals or vice versa.  This is one of the major factors that, in common speech, distinguishes between &quot;typed languages&quot; and &quot;proof assistants&quot; which otherwise are basically the same kind of thing.  Even in proof assistants, though, you still need to be quite intentional about what lemmas need to be proven in order to move toward your ultimate goal, and often even in how you phrase your goals in order to improve the chances that the heuristics will find a proof.<p>These are the kinds of things i mean by &quot;helping&quot; the system in my previous comment.  They are very powerful tools if assurance of correctness is a high priority, but definitely not a free lunch.<p>If you&#x27;re ever interested in going down the rabbit hole, there&#x27;s a pretty steep learning curve (though if you&#x27;re comfortable with ML or Haskell you&#x27;re already halfway up it) but an extensive and rewarding landscape of thought at the top.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s more of an academic or self-enrichment discipline than an industrial one these days, but if you look hard enough there are a few jobs where you can make use of these tools.",1450897257

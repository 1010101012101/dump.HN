For eg. in Argument 3 about cruise control and speeds, she says:<p><i>But the section before he broke down it does look like he chugged along at a pretty low speed.</i><p>""It does look like""? This is a graph, it has data points, its not about ""looking like"" - these points represent facts. At no point in the facts is there proof of cruise control being set at 55mph.<p>She is taking a graph with real data and attempting to re-interpret it to fit the NYTimes story. This is an emotional argument, as with 'oh no, this was actually about testing supercharge stations'.",1360875598

Now that success is no longer a symptom but the actual goal the nature of videos and their promotion will change.<p>Just like email could be used to reach large numbers of people in a short time, spam attempted to destroy it.<p>Eventually this will devolve into 'video spam' where you'll be bombarded with links to videos in the hope that they will go viral. Fortunately the cost of producing any video is so large that this will dampen the flood but if there are companies that aim specifically for virality of content then that is a sure sign that we're about to see a shift.<p>Eventually viral videos will die out because too many impulses deaden the nerve and then another useful and nice to have thing will have been murdered. Virality is the mark of excellence of a successful meme, something that should work its own way because you showed it to <i>a small number of people</i> and they decided to reward your work with a reference and so on. Forcing virality by dumping a video in front of a large number of people will simulate the effects of virality by using a starting group large enough that the eventual effect will be indistinguishable from virality.<p>But it is not the same as virality. A viral campaign costs outside of the original production costs next to nothing and is proof you got it right. If you have to force virality you are actually saying that your video is not all that good.<p>So users of services like these should realize that they are essentially admitting their content is not the real thing.",1360875569

So on an enterprise-grade DBMS it's not unheard-of for hand-coded data access layer to outperform what an ORM does by multiple orders of magnitude.<p>Of course a good ORM offers you a way to substitute your own queries.  Unfortunately teams that rely heavily on ORM aren't necessarily cultivating strong database talent, so these kinds of heinous performance drags can easily end up going undiscovered and unfixed even though the tools to deal with them are readily available.",1360875433

In fact, the more dissimilar they are in other respects, the better, because the whole point of an analogy is to show how similar features behave in different contexts.<p>For example, if you put forward the proposition, ""OJ Simpson is violent because he is black,"" I might respond by pointing to other well-known black men such as Martin Luther King, who was clearly not violent and is pretty well known as a good person. This does not mean I'm equating OJ Simpson and Martin Luther King in any respect other than their race  in fact, the differences between the men are at the heart of the comparison. They are similar in the aspect being compared (race), but otherwise unlike each other in nearly every way possible.<p>If any dissimilarity invalidated an analogy in the way you seem to believe, analogy would be altogether impossible because things could only ever be compared to themselves.<p>> <i>So using it only creates an unnecessary and invalid connection between stealing and what disqus did.</i><p>No, it doesn't!

The point is that the same justification  he offered a free service, so he is entitled to monetize it in ways that affect you without telling you and you have no right to complain  would appear to apply to the painter's actions.

State A is 60/40, state B is 45/55, and state C is 50/50. All 3 have identical populations. Now states A and B are marginally won before the election, so the race is tied and the decision lies in C. That means 1/3 of the population actually gets to decide who is going to be president. And a small fraction, some 2-3% of that state's population will actually be deciding voters (the loose cannons, the ones who could go either way). So you're down to 0.67-1% of the population deciding who will be the president. And that's completely ignoring how HORRIBLY BAD a simple majority vote is. It essentially guarantees a 2-party system. C.G.P. Grey has some nice videos on YouTube explaining the basics, if you're interested.<p>You don't fix an utterly broken system by changing the inputs.

""Yet the state of the electric car is dismal, the victim of hyped expectations, technological flops, high costs and a hostile political climate.</i><p>If you read that article, Broder was clearly referring to the controversy behind the Chevy Volt, which he also compared unfavorably to a ""lawnmower"".<p>Oh wait, that was Elon Musk who said that:

However, translational science depends on basic science for many discoveries and techniques.<p>A classical example of important basic science was the discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP). The researchers who worked on it were just curious why jellyfish glowed. However, the result of their discovery led to the widespread use of GFP as a way to tag proteins of interest, making them directly observable and easily quantifiable. It has had a huge impact on the biological sciences, gets used in all sorts of research - both translational and basic. The folks who figured it all out won a Nobel.<p>Unfortunately, none of these impacts could really have been forecasted by the researchers doing the work, and it wouldn't have been in the ""elevator pitch"".

According to Alexa, Wikipedia is the sixth most visited web site in the world. But more to the point, no VC-funded or stock-market-funded company I know of is foolish enough to try to compete with Wikipedia. I think that fifteen years from now, we will see a similar situation among Q-and-A sites -- at least those where the answers are contributed by unpaid users. In other words, I predict that Quora -- as well as Stack Exchange, which has also taken VC funding -- will be eclipsed within 15 years by sites not funded by VC or other profit-motivated investment.<p>Any competition for Google Search is likely to come from companies like Apple or Microsoft that already have plenty of money to pay engineers or from investor-funded for-profit companies. That is because the ""non-profit sector"" is unlikely to be able to summon up enough skilled labor or funding to compete with Google Search.<p>In contrast, setting up a competitor to Quora or Stack Exchange is relatively easy (especially since these new entrants can learn from Experts Exchange, Stack Exchange and Quora), and going the non-profit route (or the for-profit ""lifestyle business"" route without external funding) does not alienate a large fraction of potential unpaid contributors.",1360872612

(You can see this at work in wireless spectrum allocation, as ATT and VZN get basically all new desirable spectrum.) Maybe society is indifferent to smaller competitors' plight in general, but this won't be good for innovation.<p>Another aspect, perhaps more serious, is that it would be very difficult to audit incumbent carbon producers' use of carbon credits. These aren't physical items for which you can count inventory, nor are they currency which enters and leaves the corporation via double-entry bookkeeping; they are numbers on a spreadsheet that are credited and debited based on circumstances that have yet to be defined. Corporate executives may not be perfect stewards of shareholder interest, but they've never even thought of the stakeholders for carbon credits. Europe might not have had such problems, but my feeling is that our accountants aren't as honest or diligent as theirs are, and our corporations are governed differently.<p>Also, for years before the introduction of cap'n'trade, large polluters will have the incentive to remain large polluters, so they get the most credits they possibly can.

In particular, when abortion is not available, people will seek out services from those who know nothing about actually performing an abortion or will attempt to self induce an abortion, which can be devastating in an environment where information is not available.<p>> Okay, now you're a lot more in line with the truth -- the masterminds in charge feel they have license to prevent ""negative impact on society"". Doesn't that scare you? The people in charge are no better than you or I... in fact I'd say they're mostly worse. They're mostly power hungry and good enough liars to get elected.<p>The purpose of organizing via a government in the first place is to prevent negative impact on society, so it really comes down to specifics. Providing health care access is a net gain for everybody and can be done reasonably, but policies like wars of aggression and police militarization are a huge drain on our society and others around the world. Again, it comes down to specifics.<p>> I've heard both Biden and Obama use those EXACT reasons for why we need to raise revenues/taxes.<p>They would like to use tax revenue increases to be spent on domestic social programs, but they really can't say it will be used that way, it will all come down to actually passing some kind of legislation to raise revenue and then legislation to spend it. In the current political climate in the US, that's a tall order.<p>> You're going to split hairs and worry about exactly how much of our tax dollars were spent on an Indian reality show? Who cares? Those people are abusing their trust to reduce ""negative impact on society"" and should be booted.<p>I think it matters because its not really clear if the Dept. of Agriculture's program is useful without specific information and details about it.<p>> I didn't say Solyndra was the only loss. Once again, though, you're splitting hairs on how many million it was when the real answer should have been: No, we don't use BORROWED money to fund corporations for industries that are pet projects.<p>Solyndra was supposed to be making an improved form of photo volatic solar panels for use in residential construction. While Solyndra was a bust, government spending to advance practical applications of alternative energy technology is definitely a good idea, as we will require better technology of that kind in the future as fossil fuel extraction gets more expensive. To that end, I wouldn't call this a pet project.<p>Also, the money was a loan that was to be repaid. The bankruptcy restructuring going on now means that the loan originator (the Dept. of Energy) will lose out on some amount of that loan, but the DoE felt is was worth the risk.<p>As for using tax money (borrowed or not) to spend on corporations through loan or subsidy programs, whether or not it is a waste really depends on the specifics of what that spending seeks to accomplish and what actual results occur. Funding alternative energy research has a strong value, even if it means that sometimes the programs will lose out. Also, the DoE's loan program is not a major source of financial pressure on gov't revenues: military spending and the increasing cost of medicare/medicaid due to lack of health care reform are the two biggest pressures right now.<p>> If you doubt that billions have been wasted, you haven't been paying attention. You must not have noticed TARP, large portions of which went to save the money and jobs of wealthy bankers. yay.<p>While I don't agree with the TARP program, billions were not wasted, as the vast majority of TARP funds have been completely repaid[1]:<p>As of December 31, 2012, the Treasury had received over $405 billion in total cash back on TARP investments, equaling nearly 97 percent of the $418 billion disbursed under the program.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program</a>",1360872124

As for the rest, this is very unlikely.  Think about this for a second. They'd already started a project called ChromeOS, and they then decide to have a meeting with this guy about the idea of a web browsing laptop (or whatever)?<p>That doesn't make sense.<p>I have my own recollections of when/how the ChromeOS project started (since they asked for legal and open source advice ), and it pretty much matches other folks in that thread.  I never heard from this guy, and I had heard from now-executives (they were just regular folks back then :P) about the idea/plan.<p>So, while theoretically possible still, it's pretty unlikely. 
I expect this is simply a case where a guy thinks what he did got used elsewhere, and it wasn't.<p>There were a lot of independently developed projects that did kinda-the-same thing back in 2006-2007.",1360872087

But when Google OS was a project -- and Google financed the Nelson patent application -- who was he describing his work to? Did any of those people, or even people they passed ideas to, later help make the decision to prioritize/fund Chrome OS? If so, that's more than ""absolutely no connection"".<p>Did Brin/Page/Schmidt take interest in and see presentations about Nelson's 'Google OS'? And then later on 'Chrome OS'? That would also be more than ""absolutely no connection"".<p>Even if the 'Google OS' project was a mess and the main lesson that percolated down from it was, ""don't do it this way"", it could have been an important precedent... even if Nelson's name is forgotten.

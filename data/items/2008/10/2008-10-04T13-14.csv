323471,comment,322542,323166,0,0,13ren,,,"Having considered it overnight, I now think that the PR aspect was a red herring. The key issue was that Phil Katz provided an improvement that people wanted - and Thom didn't.<p>Although Thom claimed in the video that a licensee of his provided a version that was even quicker and smaller that Phil Katz's, I'm willing to assume that that (very valuable) improvement wasn't free (or shareware).<p>Phil Katz provided: fast, small, free. People wanted: fast, small, free. Phil wins.<p>Users are very appreciative if you meet their needs... and they'll be equally appreciative of someone else who meets their needs better. They are not as loyal as a dog (dogs being loyal... and awesome). Users are only loyal if you keep on giving them what they want (or trap them). It's just a pragmatic, business-like appreciation - not love. The technology love, of creating something new, or achieving something difficult, is a different kind of thing altogether, which has little to do with users. And which I think is a genuine love.",1223126525

Great line.  I might even go so far as to say that serving a small business niche with apps is more about price, marketing and distribution than the usability and complex features of your product.  Simple and minimum functionality seem to work as long as the product has a minimum of functionality.",1223125887

3002996,comment,3000863,3000863,5,0,sreque,,,"C# is a good production language. It lets twiddle you your bits almost as well as C when you need to, provides a decent OO model, and has been piling on more functional and dynamic features as the years go by. However, as someone who has had to port a .Net C# app from windows to Linux, I can witness with sincerity that C# is NOT very portable.<p>First of all, a lot of the C# APIs are written with windows in mind. An example is system mutexes. These just don't exist on Linux, and the mono implementation to emulate them is very buggy. Another example is the process counter API. Although much of this same information is available on Linux via the Proc table, Mono provides no equivalent API because it would be a lot of work to make one that works on all the Unix variants. There are many such examples of C#'s windows-centric API not being ported well in Mono.<p>A bigger problem with Mono is that it just wasn't stable for us. The more standard library features we used, the more it would core dump on Linux even though it would never crash on windows. We ended up re-implementing a lot of functionality available in the standard library ourselves before the program stabilized on mono, which further incriminates the Mono stack. As a final note, we tried multiple versions of Mono, including 2.4, 2.6, and 2.10, and none of them worked well for us.<p>If you want to write a fairly performant cross-platform app,  the JVM is still a much better place to play in right now than .Net, even though I like C# the language a lot more than I do Java. You can also go the route of combining your favorite scripting language with C for the CPU-intensive parts.",1316141285

3002987,comment,3002389,3002678,3,0,oblique63,,,"Agreed.  I'm currently working on a startup that's focusing pretty heavily on that (<a href=""http://www.tabrat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tabrat.com/</a>), and let me tell you, even if somebody were to get it 'exactly right', it would still be quite the uphill battle to get it adopted. That's assuming it's a legitimate re-imagining that deviates from the current system of course, and not some C++ style superset.  Nothing wrong with teaching an old dog new tricks (in fact it's what we're planning to do in the meantime), but it wouldn't really be anything new, because that is exactly how music notation evolved to be how it is today (excluding tablature for fretted instruments, which should be considered a good, albeit limited, innovation in it's own right).<p>The people that use notation the most, and take it the most seriously, are usually the ones that have invested a ton of time learning to sight read and knowing how to properly express their ideas in it; hence they are almost certainly going to be hesitant about switching to a new format.  We musicians tend to be a conservative bunch; after our first few years playing/experimenting, we pretty much solidify what we like and hardly ever deviate from it afterwards.<p>I (a guitarist) for example, only really play 2 brands of strings, I have already made vast generalizations in my head about what amp/guitar/pedal brands I like and don't like (as opposed to judging on a product-by-product basis like I would for most other things), and I don't see that changing soon.  Likewise, once you develop your notation style, it would probably be hard to really think of trying something new when you've just come up with a cool riff and get caught up in the heat of the moment trying to build on it.<p>Although I can't wait to see the day the next evolution in songwriting starts getting widely adopted, I can't say that what we have now is really that bad. Traditional staff sheet music does makes it easy to 'visualize' what a piece sounds like, and that's a feat that even well notated tablature can sometimes struggle to convey.<p>As for my startup? We just want musicians to be able to precisely jot down something like this on a moment's whim (fx and all):\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU52hGo3nNc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU52hGo3nNc</a>",1316140922

I think the real deal with that video is that it is just completely made up entertainment for the viewers, not an actual documentary of something that happened. That, or there is something not shown in it.<p>It seems rather unlikely to me that a few cues placed would make someone's behavior that predictable. What about the lifetime of other cues they have to draw from, or even just simple random whims that can influence the outcome?",1316140818

For example, there must be a cameraman in the car on the trip, and he deliberately films the supposed subliminal cues. Are we expected to believe that the people in the car did not notice this? And there are other carefully positioned cameramen on the route the car takes. Etc. I think it likely that the video is a setup -- or at least a very poorly designed experiment.<p>I realize that this article is really about Whole Foods and their marketing strategy. Still, the article spends three paragraphs talking about Brown's ""trick"", implying that it is solid evidence of an surprising and significant phenomenon.<p>And now the question: What you do think? Also, does anyone have more concrete evidence on trustworthiness of the Brown video?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQjr1YL0zg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyQjr1YL0zg</a>",1316140806

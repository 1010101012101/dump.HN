I think his complaint is less about control over his spending, but about the intrusiveness and confusion the constant up-selling causes.<p>He&#x27;s not afraid of Nana spending a boatload on IAPs (though that has happened...), he&#x27;s frustrated that these games are bombarding Nana with bright flashing buttons that have nothing to do with the core gameplay which he has already bought (either upfront or via IAPs), and making it harder for her to play the game.<p>This is basically the native app equivalent of complaining about intrusive omnipresent banner ads, overlays, and interstitials. They&#x27;re grossly damaging to the user experience.

Maybe it just further consolidates income and wealth on the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum.<p>> They&#x27;re in the opposite position, statistically, where the losses to purchasing power from savings is outweighed by the gains from the reduction of debt.<p>Poor people likely do not have meaningful savings so it&#x27;s their very fixed incomes that is losing purchasing power, and their debts are often short term instruments that will compound the problem.<p>Speaking of inflation and savings and the poor, there is an episode of the late 1970&#x27;s tv show &quot;Good Times&quot; where the family encounters a windfall, and one of the kids asks the dad what they should do with it, and the dad replied, and I&#x27;m paraphrasing, &quot;We better spend it right away [perhaps on durable goods], becuase tomorrow it won&#x27;t be worth anything.&quot;  Having lived all of my life with relatively low inflation rates, as I child, I just assumed, as a comedy, it was just highlighting the foolish short-sighted decision making of the poor.  Later in life I now appreciate what a powerfully poignant economic anecdote that scene represents.<p>Does anyone happen to know which one that was?  Now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, I can&#x27;t think of any modern TV shows that come close to depicting the lifestyles of poor people as &quot;Good Times&quot; did.",1387345776

That doesn&#x27;t make this behavior adaptive. Humans didn&#x27;t evolve under an environment of plenty, so their behavior in such an environment does not necessarily maximize survival value.

But the society in general doesn&#x27;t trust such low-end products. Asians are very skeptical. Yes, loads of peoples still buy them. But no one would choose this over a high end device just because of the price. If they happen to beat the IPad sales, it&#x27;s not because people find this more attractive than the ipad, it&#x27;s just that those people can&#x27;t afford to buy an ipad but would still like a piece of the game.<p>So it&#x27;s not exactly a competitor of main stream tablets, its more of a niche product. And in US they are trying to be &quot;disposable&quot;. Aiming for more niche markets like schools. It&#x27;s a pretty good strategy. In fact they are more likely to get more sales in US because as you can see, a lot of people here are considering buying it. In India, most people would see the price and would stop reading.

Thanks.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Germany&#x27;s &#x27;Mitfahrgelegenheit&#x27; service [1] is highly successful, and includes many of the same features that Ridejoy built. I&#x27;ve used it a few times to travel between cities (large and small) in Germany... it&#x27;s primary advantage is price-- approximately 50% of the price of a rail ticket (cheaper for the passenger) and takes the edge off the $8/gallon gasoline prices for the driver. While price may be a motivating factor, there are numerous  systemic differences that come to mind when comparing ridesharing in the US and in Germany, such as the shorter distance between all major cities (though perhaps similar to NE USA), as well as Germany&#x27;s love for the cars and the autobahn.<p>One other note: on one of the drives, I learned that the system nearly broke down due to &quot;professional&quot; drivers renting large vans and overselling tickets for each ride to ensure that the vans were full. Then, when enough passengers had arrived, the van left, leaving the remaining passengers hosed. Since you only pay at the end of the ride, passengers started overbooking themselves, hosing other drivers. In the end this was rectified by putting the cost of the trip into escrow from the time of booking to the end of the trip.<p>1. <a href=\"http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de/</a>",1387343753

Maybe specialists. Doctors. Mechanics. People who have their hands full but still need to access informational resources. But for general use, they&#x27;re just too distancing. And intimidating, frankly.<p>(Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- they look cool and I&#x27;d love to try it out. And there might be a business, here. But it reminds me of the Segway: Touted as the revolutionizer of cities, but in the end something with limited utility once the hype-wave settled.)",1387342892

I&#x27;d like to know what happens if I take the entire contents of my 1920x1080 desktop and project it say...4 feet away.  Does it look like crap or not?  For some reason in all of their promo material I can&#x27;t see a normal looking desktop projected.<p>They&#x27;re going to have to show much less marketing hype and much more practical use.

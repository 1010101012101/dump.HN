40942,comment,40615,40850,0,0,DougR,,,"As entrepreneurs, we value our sweat and take a founder-like common stake for our participation. In a way, you can view working with us as adding another founder to your team, although you drive the day-to-day operations, and we help where and when needed.  The exact common stake we take varies by opportunity. The $850K is invested at standard valuations in exchange for preferred stock. Again, if you don't need or want our help and are only looking for money, we are not the right fit.",1186678645

Our grades are not very objective.  But maybe that's because we only have oral examination and we do not have to do much arithmetic.",1186678423

40938,comment,40847,40895,0,0,vegashacker,,,"Just that college, for me, was the opposite of this vocational training ground.  It was this beautiful, theoretical, pure learning environment that discouraged placing limits on what you could do with your life.<p>Now, sure, some people enter the cube farm (and stay there) right after college, but I don't think it was college that made those people do that.  I think it was everything else (e.g., family, the desire to have material things, the need to be ""normal"", etc).",1186678325

40936,comment,40615,40797,0,0,DougR,,,"Sure.  How we add sweat is very subjective and is much easier to answer in context of a particular business.  It tends to be very clear on all sides by the end of our first meeting.  That being said, here is a high level answer and a couple of examples... <p>We are entrepreneurs, and as such just do what is needed. If we don't believe we can add value to a business, we don't get involved.  We insist that the founders control the various aspects of the business, but we also look for opportunities that need our support on a day-to-day basis in the beginning. Once the business has some level of traction, we step back and make ourselves available when and where you need us (including help on large strategic deals or even to sell the business).  If you don't need or want our help and are only looking for money, we are not the right fit.<p>The key elements in execution are - the right thing to do, the right time to do it and the right way to do it.  We participate with the founders to help make these decisions on both the technology and business sides. We help where needed on strategy, marketing, bus dev, and tech architecture and provide the infrastructure needed on the administrative side (legal, finance, pr, etc.).  <p>Couple of real life examples. In one of our businesses, certain technical scalability issues were identified and the question was how to solve them and when to solve them. We got involved and were a valuable resource for the founders as we understood the business objectives, development resources and the underlying technology. If need be, we can tune queries and look at code, but most of the time acting a good sounding board is all that's required.   <p>In another case, there was a key question on the initial go-to-market approach for the business. Here, we brought people from other related organizations to the table to help in our decision.  We worked with them and the founders to make an informed choice.  So far, the results have been very positive...

40934,comment,40888,40907,0,0,sabat,,,"Agreed. One of the reasons it works here in SF CA is because of the type of people we attract -- and have been attracting for 150+ years. Do-it-yourselfers, iconoclasts, vagabonds, that type of person. Twain, London, those guys. Seriously. It takes an adventurer to want to build a startup, and for whatever reason, CA attracts those types.<p>Obviously that's not the only reason, but I think it's a factor.",1186677811

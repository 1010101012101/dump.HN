E coli, the humble gut bacterium, seems to have four copies of hydrogenase.  Two come from the broad class of &quot;formate hydrogen lyase&quot;; the other two are &quot;uptake hydrogenases&quot;.  Almost certainly they come from horizontal gene transfer, because other gammaproteobacteria may or may not have some or all of these hydrogenases; and you will find uptake hydrogenases scattered through bacteria (and archaeal) phyla.<p>the hydrogenase that I work with is part of a mobile element; it&#x27;s found in our organism in a gene island, but also straight up in the genome of another organism that was isolated 5000 kilometers away, in a totally different ecotype.  both of these guys are found in the ocean, but none of the other members in the broad family that it comes from are oceanic:  they come from terrestrial volcanic mats.<p>So obviously species-wise discrete or fuzzy taxa do not work for me; but even protein phylogenetics can be muddied by things like random gene fusions and convergent evolution.  I&#x27;m not sure that some of the trees that I generate are actually taxonomic, but may be the result of selective pressure against a highly conserved scaffold.<p>Of course, they&#x27;re still useful, even if they&#x27;re bullshit...

Straight couples can reproduce with their spouse - gays cannot.

6072528,comment,6068360,6070440,1,0,kragen,,,"Well, you could do it this way:<p><pre><code>    (defn cross2 [xs ys]
     (cond (or (and (sequential? xs) (empty? xs)) (empty? ys)) &#x27;()
           (not (sequential? xs)) (cons (list xs (first ys)) (cross2 xs (rest ys)))
           true (concat (cross2 (first xs) ys) (cross2 (rest xs) ys))))
</code></pre>
which is pretty much exactly homologous, allowing for the detail that you can&#x27;t ask if an atom is empty? in Clojure, cond (Arc-like) takes alternating conditions and consequents rather than condition-consequent pairs, and the spellings of the list operations no longer refer to IBM 709 machine instructions.  Also, it works on any kind of sequences, not just lists, with of course a punishing performance overhead on sequences whose `rest` operation is slow.<p>But I would argue that this interface is poorly designed, since you can say (cross2 &#x27;(a b c) &#x27;(1 2 3)) or (cross2 &#x27;a &#x27;(1 2 3)) but not (cross2 &#x27;(a b c) &#x27;1), and worse, (cross2 &#x27;(a (b c) d) &#x27;(1 2 3)) implicitly flattens the (b c) into individual items, which is probably a latent bug rather than desired behavior.  So I would argue for writing it in this form instead:<p><pre><code>    (defn sc [x ys]  ; scalar cross
          (if (empty? ys) &#x27;() 
              (cons (list x (first ys)) (sc x (rest ys)))))

    (defn cross [xs ys]
          (if (or (empty? xs) (empty? ys)) &#x27;()
              (concat (sc (first xs) ys) (cross (rest xs) ys))))
</code></pre>
which avoids those irregularities and makes the code easier to understand by removing misleading false symmetries.<p>Except really, if this isn&#x27;t a homework problem, I think you should write it like this in any of these three Lisps:<p><pre><code>    (defn cross [xs ys]
          (map (fn [x] (map (fn [y] (list x y)) ys)) xs))</code></pre>",1374263641

I&#x27;d be very interested to hear people&#x27;s experiences with it. It&#x27;s what we do, except we run the global event processor on a JS timer so that it works like a game loop picking items off a queue. Our DOM event handlers (the things you call addEventListener with) are all trivial stubs that simply create JSON descriptions of events as they happen and append them to that queue. We tried many different approaches before we hit on this, and it works surprisingly well in the two hardest areas: managing complexity and keeping the UI snappy.<p>You can also create perceived concurrency this way: you do a little work on an item in the queue and then, if it&#x27;s not done, put it back at the back of the line. That&#x27;s how we do the &quot;time-sensitive operations&quot; you mention.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what to call this design.

Most of the time they do not know they are doing this.<p>There is a bedrock falsehood that somehow wrapping the word &quot;science&quot; around something prevents it from this problem. It does not. Science history has taught us that for the most part, the <i>social</i> part of science works just like the social part of any other industry: there are cool people, there are weirdos, there&#x27;s folks who have amazing ideas, there are fads, there are things the group feels strongly about, and so on. In other words, scientists, like all of us, operate in clans and herds. (Their herds just have much better names!)<p>Pay attention: I am not trying to trash the entire field of science. Far from it. Science is the light we have in the darkness. It&#x27;s mankind&#x27;s only hope. But what I&#x27;m trying to show is that reading articles like &quot;the science of why we don&#x27;t believe in science&quot; is bullshit. In it, the writer will just put his own misconceptions, or popular opinion, in the place of what is right and show the various ways people do not agree with him and how they are broken. The subtext is clear: we, the cognoscenti, know the truth. It&#x27;s those poor other rubes that aren&#x27;t getting it.<p>I&#x27;ve long said I do not know what the climate is going to do. Looking at some of the models&#x27; performance and the lack of any other planet-sized biological systems to study, I have my doubts that others do either, but that&#x27;s just my own bias. What I <i>can</i> say is that the discussion around climate science is full of horse shit so deep that you&#x27;d need an excavator working 24/7 for a year to dig your way out. It has become politicized, and scientists have crossed the line between telling us what <i>is</i> and telling us <i>what we should do</i>.<p>This politicization of science is not good for politics or for science, because Average Joe Sixpack is going to start lumping in all information he receives under the rubric &quot;science&quot; as being suspect. He doesn&#x27;t have the time nor inclination to sort out the different types of proofs we have for Newtonian physics versus evolutionary psychology. To him, it&#x27;s all just &quot;science&quot;. And when one of these sciences promotes something that later on turns out to be highly-opinionated BS, it hurts the entire field. It&#x27;s bad enough when journalists do this with poor science stories, but when scientists themselves start playing the game of &quot;who&#x27;s right and who&#x27;s wrong&quot; in the world, it destroys the very thing they&#x27;re supposed to be promoting. Very bad.<p>So when I read articles about how one political party has differently-organized brains than the other one, or about various forms of cognitive bias influencing politics, or how denialism and being a crank has a scientific basis, I wince. This is not helpful. Please stop. You are not the scientific, reasonable-minded judge of rationality you think you are. None of us are. If you absolutely must say something, make the general point and move on. Otherwise you are creating the very problem that you say you are just trying to point out.",1374262151

Marriage legalities, and the underlying model of the relationship in marriage on which they are based, aren&#x27;t the product of some long-static &quot;traditional&quot; model that had been undisturbed for an extended period of time before the same-sex marriage debate.<p>> There&#x27;s nothing that stops homosexuals from fulfilling their emotional, romantic, and other needs.<p>Actually, not having access to the legal rights involved in marriage does prevent that.<p>>  But when you involved tax deductions because children are such an expensive commitment, it gets hairy.<p>The tax deductions on that premise require you to have children that you are responsible, they aren&#x27;t an automatic consequence of marriage. So I don&#x27;t see how they are relevant. The situation in which marriage has tax benefits is if, as part of a couple&#x27;s arrangement of mutual support, one focuses more on work outside of the house (which is taxable) supported by the other taking on a heavier load of the domestic duties, since married couples pay lower taxes than two individuals when there is a significant disparity of income.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure how your statement above has anything to do with marriage. It seems to have something to do with not wanting people to get tax deductions or credits that come with raising children without actually raising children, which is sensible but completely irrelevant.<p>> I do support civil unions<p>Given your statement above about the &quot;legality of marriage&quot; and that &quot;civil unions&quot; as opposed to &quot;domestic partnership&quot; is usually the term given for providing the legalities of marriage under a different name, why?<p>> (but not gay adoption)<p>Why? Is it that you prefer children to have less chance of having permanent families and spend more time in foster homes? Or just because you dislike homosexuals?<p>> and I am tolerant of gays (I discuss these issues with friends who are gay)<p>And I&#x27;m sure they appreciate your magnanimity in deigning to discuss with them the reasons why you think they should receive unequal treatment under the law.<p>> but to change the very definition of marriage goes too far - and ends up confusing everyone.<p>&quot;The very definition of marriage&quot; has been pretty much continuously changing throughout all of history. Its not all that confusing, and, to the extent it is, your desire to avoid dealing with the confusion of changing social institutions isn&#x27;t a reason other people ought to suffer discrimination.",1374261444

The law was designed to be flexible and evolve with society&#x27;s needs and desires.<p>Allowing gay marriage is a <i>minor</i> adjustment of what we in the US currently understand marriage to be - not a &quot;changing of the very definition&quot;. If we were talking about polygamy that would be a much stronger case.<p>Society encourages and allows marriages for a variety of reasons - involving tradition, encouraging general stability, families, etc. It also has a certain understanding of marriage - a partnership between two people. Homosexual marriage vis a vis heterosexual marriage is the same in all these respects in practical terms.<p>To be clear, there are difference in say how gay couples reproduce (in general)...but there are differences in how heterosexual marriages reproduce too. The supposed fundamental &quot;differences&quot; in gay couples are already tolerated (or entirely unproblematic) in the hetero population so banning gay marriages as a means to discourage them is not a valid argument. It&#x27;s an artificial distinction.<p>Let&#x27;s be honest - opposition to gay marriage is based on religion, ignorance, or personal aesthetics. Hey, that&#x27;s fine - we&#x27;re all entitled to our beliefs ...but let&#x27;s be explicit and honest about it instead of kidding ourselves and each other.<p>If you really do want to stick to this farce, then at least be consistent and start demanding people must pass fertility and mental health exams before they can be married - to prove that they can produce children and raise them in a healthy environment.",1374261088

With this model, each paid user covers the cost of their usage (and not the usage of the 10s of free users their money has to cover with a freemium service) and it means we&#x27;re still incentivised to continue to update and improve the service, so people renew their subscription at the end of the year.",1374260661

All he did was to download a large number of publicly funded scientific papers that he should have had access to anyway. MIT did not just report him. They made sure that the secret service was there in a couple of minutes and then they insisted on prosecuting him.

They’re slow, they’re brittle, they require careful environment setup and teardown, and they’re much more difficult to write and maintain than unit tests.&quot;<p>Slow is okay. It&#x27;s better to be realistic than fast. You can also throw computing power (which is cheap) at slow. You can&#x27;t throw computing power at unrealistic.<p>Brittle means either you have bugs which your test helpfully uncovered for you (e.g. race conditions) or you wrote a buggy test.<p>&quot;Moreover, testing through the UI for every scenario in your code is just unnecessary&quot;<p>It&#x27;s almost always better to loosely couple your tests.

Agile is about finding flaws and managing in a way that&#x27;s beneficial for the product being developed. A corollary is that it should lead to a better process, thus leaving everyone happy.<p>This is what I find out happens all the time:<p>- in retrospective, everyone can easily pick the problems within a sprint\n- very short sprints burn alot of time in meetings\n- product owners always try to introduce features at the middle of the sprint, make sure they don&#x27;t do this\n- it is of foremost importance to a) define a fixed number of features/items at the beginning of each sprint, and b) commit to ONLY that, unless critical bugs appear. Another corollary is that to shield developers, there should be a single point of contact between product owners and devs. better yet, ensure that devs dont get to discuss things with product owners during the sprint dev time\n- definition of &#x27;done&#x27; is also extremely important. make sure that everyone is on the same page, you can even define a checklist and apply it to your issue tracker. Example: done means code pushed and reviewed by another person, tests for the feature, and any other item that should be necessary for you\n- estimations are crap unless the process is running smoothly. If you&#x27;re doing agile correctly, either the process is smooth or you are always fixing problems in the process.<p>If the devs are talented, any dev can implement a feature in a reasonable amount of time. What I think agile brings to the table is a set of methodologies for a team to consistently implement features that are the most valuable to the product owner.",1440082028

I remember this being a particularly important distinction in learning American Sign Language (ASL) because the vocabulary is roughly English-ish it is very easy to transliterate and try to say in ASL an English sentence &quot;as is&quot; without meaningful changes, but just with dealing with the differences between, say, English and Spanish, to speak ASL properly you need to actually translate to more idiomatic forms and abstractions. This is extremely important to ASL not just from a &quot;speak better ASL&quot; standpoint but also because it comes out of a foundational, cultural imperative: ASL was not seen as &quot;a real language&quot; until it proven to some linguists that it validly needed translation, was not just a transliteration of English but in fact a language with its own idioms and grammar requiring translation. This disagreement is so fundamental to ASL also because there was so much pressure from people to &quot;speak real English&quot; rather than develop their own language. There is a transliteration-focused &quot;alternative&quot; to ASL that includes all of the useless English grammar and stutter words like &quot;the&quot; that ASL handles grammatically different, and ASL had to prove its existence against it and also to prove that it was better and also to prove that ASL speakers could still read/write English to work with the rest of the English-speaking country when their native language was grammatically different enough to require translation... It&#x27;s an interesting cultural battle to read about.<p>All of which is a long winded example to get back to the idea that the translation/transliteration difference is very similar to the compilation/transpilation difference and while I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve yet seen a cultural battle for supremacy between the terms, I do think there is a usefulness in keeping the distinction. I also see the conversion between idioms/abstractions as being the key difference between compilation and transpilation. Machine language has much different idioms/abstractions from a high-level language; CoffeeScript and TypeScript try to stay very similar in idiom/abstraction to EcmaScript.",1440081993

10092126,comment,10091583,10091798,0,0,skrebbel,,,"A thousand times this. The retrospective blows all the other elements of $YOUR_FAVOURITE_PROCESS out of the water.<p>3 things about it: if you do sprints, and they have busy beginnings and endings, then there&#x27;s no harm in planning the retrospective halfway the sprint instead of at the end. Improvements can be made at any time. Also, if your sprints are weeks, consider making the retrospective bi-weekly, that&#x27;s usually enough.<p>Second, <i>don&#x27;t</i> skip the retrospective. It&#x27;s never urgent, but it&#x27;s <i>very</i> important. Every team is different and every situation is different, and no agile book can cover all cases. The retrospective makes you own your process, makes the entire team feel like their opinion matters. It improves both effectiveness and morale. Give it time - especially in the beginning it might last 2 hours easily. It&#x27;s worth that.<p>Finally, do the retrospective right. You want <i>actionable</i> results out of it. If it&#x27;s just a complaining session, you&#x27;re missing out on its value.<p>What I usually do is this: I make a poster with 3 columns, <i>:-)</i>, <i>:-/</i> and <i>!</i>. Every team member has to make at least 2 green and 2 red sticky notes, on which great stuff and improvement points are written, respectively. More is OK, less is not. This forces them to really think about what could be better even if on first thought they think things are going pretty OK.<p>Make every team member put the sticky note on the board in the left two columns and explain what it&#x27;s about and why it matters. Have people group sticky notes that are about roughly the same thing. Finally, and this is the part people tend to forget, distill a bunch of <i>action points</i> for the third column that will help tackle the problems in the 2nd column. Make these actionable, assignable. You might want to make them tasks in your scrum process, just like programming tasks. Without action points, a retrospective is mostly a waste of time.<p>If a discussion about one action point is long or very technical (discussions about how to use source control come to mind), ask the people who <i>care</i> about it to discuss it amongst each other present the solution a day later. This works great for distributed teams too (&quot;Problem: the git is becoming a mess. Solution: $NAME makes a Slack channel and presents the outcome tomorrow&quot;). Everybody who doesn&#x27;t involve himself in that discussion is expected to agree automatically.<p>You can&#x27;t improve the process super much in a short amount of time. If you make too many action points, half of them will not get done - people need to make software, too! So if there&#x27;s, say, >4 real decent problems in column 2, ask the team to score problems and pick the ones with the highest score. One good way is to give everyone 3 votes that they can arbitrarily spread across the problem stickies (multiple votes per sticky allowed). Pick the 4 problems with the most points.<p>Consider using real stickies and not computer stuff, even if your team is partly remote. Tangible things that you move across a board somehow makes things seem more real, like they matter more.<p>Good luck!",1440081713

This is usually a result of having process for the sake of process and including things in your process that don&#x27;t actually benefit anyone.<p>IMO, it&#x27;s generally easier to start with minimal process and include things as needed to solve specific problems. What this requires is that you&#x27;re able to identify problems as early as possible.<p>The last thing you want to do is come up with a 6 month plan and realize in the 5th month that things have veered far off course. This is why teams break things up into sprints. I&#x27;d suggest taking your 6 month plan, and as best as you can split all of the tasks into sprints up front. Focus on your end goal, but break it up into manageable pieces. Don&#x27;t stick to these sprints either. Typically you&#x27;d re-evaluate this plan after every sprint, but there&#x27;s flexibility for you to do what works.<p>Then there&#x27;s transparency and communication among team members. This is why a lot of teams do standups, but don&#x27;t think that means that your team needs to do standups. For some teams that are already good at communicating and keeping each other informed, a simple chat room may be all you need. This is more common with teams that have worked together in the past and are already comfortable with each other. If your team tends to keep to themselves then look into standup meetings. There&#x27;s plenty of articles on how to run them, what&#x27;s important is that everyone is brief to make them quick, and you push deeper discussions into a chat after the meeting so those not involved in those discussions can get back to work.",1440081360

Functions are modules that have singular discrete testable functionality and composites are similar to classes but yeild an object tethered to state/options but mainly glued together from modules that expose a single workflow function.<p>There&#x27;s also control/workflow type composition, and node-style object pipes tend to work very well in many of those scenarios... get batch of items from db into an object stream through workflow steps, queues, etc.<p>It&#x27;s definitely an interesting abstraction of a few ideas together, I&#x27;m not sure what it does in terms of improving a larger workflow.

And this is what kills the system. We already have a system where the income of each person is topped up to a certain level of &quot;livable level&quot;, on top of housing costs; this means that quite a number of people have not much incentive to optimize their housing cost as it is anyway paid by the government, and that in turn means that housing is quite expensive (comparison to NY is not entirely wrong). Property investors are happy, of course, because taxpayers foot the bill.<p>Overall, the problem is that what is called &quot;atypical job&quot; is nowadays typical, and the system cannot adapt. The only way seems to do it via an insolvency of the government.",1440080168

Therefore, the most important piece of your process is something that lets you modify it as you go.&quot;<p>Honestly, if you aren&#x27;t doing this, you aren&#x27;t doing &quot;Agile&quot;, in the sense of the Agile Manifesto. If you are getting beat over the head by your scrum master with the &quot;official Scrum process&quot;, you&#x27;re not actually doing Agile. Scrum is an interesting toolbox to pull tools from; if you view it as a proscription, you&#x27;re not doing Agile. Likewise for the other techniques offered by other people.<p>When people complain about fake Agile, I believe this is the big error that is being made.<p>I&#x27;ve done projects where we did 1 week iterations. I&#x27;ve done projects with story points and without. Right now I&#x27;m on a project where we&#x27;re doing one iteration a month. And if you&#x27;re about to jump up and try to explain to me why that&#x27;s not &quot;doing it right&quot;... well, that&#x27;s exactly what I mean. It turns out that for <i>this project</i> it&#x27;s working great. We didn&#x27;t start at that rate... we evolved into it when it became clear that 2 weeks wasn&#x27;t useful for us.<p>See, my previous projects haven&#x27;t had much use for the &quot;sprint demo&quot; but it&#x27;s a critical part of this one, and we were noticing that neither the project team <i>nor</i> the customers were all that excited about the demos every 2 weeks, and we were running the risk of exhausting our customer&#x27;s patience. This project isn&#x27;t &quot;customer facing&quot; per se, and the tasks I get in this project aren&#x27;t the sort where we need to do lots of UI explorations, where we need the demos very frequently to make sure we&#x27;re going down the right track. Generally we get handend relatively well-defined tasks and our demos are more for convincing people progress is being made, getting feedback about priorities, and ensuring that the customers are happy and aware of what is going on. (The customers in this case are other developers in the organization.)<p>I offer that as an example of the sort of justification a team <i>properly</i> doing Agile ought to be able to provide for their choices. &quot;Our Scrum book says&quot; is not a reason to do something, or at least, it shouldn&#x27;t be past the first 3 months.",1440080059

The monotonous consulting-services work I&#x27;ve been doing for the last 5+ years hasn&#x27;t lent itself to exploring new technologies, so I don&#x27;t have the breadth for an architect job. I&#x27;ve tried the solo-business route, and while my app is loved and has sold copies, it&#x27;s only breaking even and won&#x27;t sustain me now.<p>Almost all of the jobs I am interested in (remote or product-based) want newer technology. SQL Server&#x27;s been a big part of my entire career, but it feels like that is losing relevance with the ORMs/EFs of the world. I&#x27;ve only worked with MVC on personal projects, but even if I brushed up on it, I&#x27;m guessing managers would feel I am an expensive hire without any advantage a junior dev who worked with MVC their whole career.<p>Do I try to build a MVC portfolio, since that seems to be the popular MS technology? Or work on a JS portfolio (my web style today is already JS calling JSON services) and try to rebuild myself on the front end?<p>Do I take a big pay cut and try to rebuild my skills with a company open to a senior dev without the exact experience?<p>Do I try to gamble and find myself a newer technology to reinvent myself into, hoping it sticks around?<p>Or am I just at the natural point in my career where I&#x27;m supposed to be working for another services company?<p>Anyone refactor themselves into something new at a similar point in their career?

Having even an incidentally undersized cluster for ES is dangerous.<p>I worked with ES for a while with a pretty reasonably sized cluster and what I considered to be a pretty reasonably sized data set. I frequently ran into cases where ES nodes, and the cluster in general, handled resource overflows in an utterly brain-damaged way.<p>Doing bulk loading? Don&#x27;t let your request be larger than 200MB -- Jetty will crash and hand off corrupt and incomplete data to the loader, which will happily load it. You&#x27;ll never notice unless you look at the logs.<p>Trying to fit a little less than half as much data as you have space on disk? Better hope none of your nodes ever have a connectivity problem -- automatic shard replication will attempt to replicate a shard to a machine that doesn&#x27;t have enough space to hold it, will fail to recognize that shard replication was incomplete, and half your requests will go to an incomplete and corrupted shard. You won&#x27;t notice it unless you&#x27;re staring at the logs when it happens. If you don&#x27;t catch it in time, the corrupted shard itself could be replicated. The only fix is to wipe the entire cluster and reload.<p>Trying to save space by using java&#x27;s default memory pre-allocation sizes? Better hope you don&#x27;t have very much data. When ES gets bigger than your -Xmx setting, it won&#x27;t die -- it&#x27;ll just slowly begin to corrupt all your shards, and happily serve corrupt information from corrupt shards.<p>Basically, if using ES, make sure you have <i>many many</i> times the resources as you do data, and be <i>very conservative</i> about using those resources, because running out of any single resource means ditching the cluster and reloading all data from scratch.<p>(These experiences occurred in ~2011 and in ~2013. It&#x27;s possible that some of these problems have been fixed. However, at the time, Shay Banon&#x27;s position on most bugs of this type is that running out of resources is the user&#x27;s problem and ES has no responsibility to mitigate the damage -- a general policy of wontfix on anything to do with failure states involving running out of resources.)",1440079467

(emphasis there, because such a large percentage of that huge increase in prison population has been black)<p>None of that happens in a vacuum. If you lock up a parent for drugs, and his son is raised in a broken household, in a broken neighborhood overflowing with the effects of failed war on drugs policies, what&#x27;s the likely outcome to that situation? You don&#x27;t have to take my word for it, read any interview with any black person that has ever made it out of that situation. Read about what their lives were like, what the culture was like, what their households were like.<p>That&#x27;s why this article&#x27;s premise is so obviously far off.

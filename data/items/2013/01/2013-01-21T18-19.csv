I suppose this doesn't sound like too much but in the UK you have no reason to have a tax identification number unless you're self-employed and already trading.  In the UK you don't have a VAT id unless you're making 77k.  Outside Germany showing your home address on the web is considered a bit crazy.  Consider now that if you're trying to get Paymill to authorise you are probably are not trading yet.

The difference is that Haskell has a place for you to document (in the type system) whether functions have certain types of effects (and if you cooperate just a little, the compiler will make sure this documentation is correct).  The cost is the (conceptual) overhead of actually doing this - which is small when you know what you're building but can require some re-plumbing of a chunk of your code when things change.<p>This difference isn't <i>inherently</i> a win for Haskell - that OCaml <i>doesn't</i> bear the cost of significant restructuring because you find you need to do some IO based on results internal to a function several layers down is a big win in the short term.  Whether it's a win in the long term, and how much the short matters versus the long, would seem to depend very much on the particular problems you're solving.<p>Having come to Haskell from C by way of OCaml, my personal preference is to get as much out of the type system as one can - but one should always be aware of the trade-offs.",1358793574

5092902,comment,5086002,5086816,1,0,tripzilch,,,"First of, this isn't about deeply nested structures, the flat example demonstrates the problem perfectly fine :)<p>> But in any normal design you never put the message length into the same parser, you use it to read the message, and the parser is fed the message when you have received that many bytes.<p>Won't work, this is a fundamental problem in computing science.<p>Splitting the parser into a pre-parser and a post-parser isn't going to help solve the fundamental problem, because the combination of two parsers is still a parser.<p>One of the problems is, you cannot distinguish <blob> bytes from <length> bytes. If the data stream gets out of sync with the parser state (hiccup, dropped packet), you have a very non-trivial problem on your hands. A context-free grammer however, is free of context (ohh!) and can therefore resync in time proportional to how deep it's nested.<p>Speaking of nesting, that's another bit where I expect CSGs to become incredibly hairy: Of course you can use a hybrid approach: length-prefixed messages for the ""outer stream"", and a context-free XML/JSON/Lisp style format (delimiters on both sides[0]) for recursive structures. But why would you do that? If you wanted to save bytes by avoiding the delimiters on the very outer structures, there's a <i>lot more</i> of them to be saved if you apply the same ""optimization"" to any inner recursive structures. If you don't know what I'm talking about, think about how a tree-like recursive datastructure is represented in the memory of a C program. Yes pointers. Alternatively you could length-prefix them like before, C programs don't do that because you need to scan through everything and it's less efficient. Regardless, both approaches are context-sensitive and good luck on distinguishing malformed data from correct ones.<p>Now, this whole ""formal languages and automatons"" is a very complex subject matter[1], so while it may seem that the whole argument hinges on dropping a packet and desyncing the parser[2], I got the feeling from that talk that there are other (similarly fundamental) problems, but this particular one I understood and can make a compelling argument for :)<p>[0] afaik you might actually get away with a delimiter on just one side, but that makes it harder to parse because you need strict precedence rules to resolve ambiguities (e.g. 2+3<i>4+1</i>8<i>2+1+1+7</i>4<i>3</i>2<i>1+0)<p>[1] it was considered one of the hardest courses during my CS college years (the other one being on ""formal proofs of program correctness""), for various reasons I retook this course 4 times (underestimating its difficulty at first being one of those reasons), but when I finally did pass, I did so with a score of 9 out of 10, I'm kinda proud of that :P But the </i>real* benefit of studying 4 times for the same difficult course is that you never really forget it (some parallels there with that post about ""spaced repetition learning"" last week).<p>[2] another thing they recommended that makes a lot of sense, but again is a parsing complexity (security) vs bandwidth efficiency trade-off: to make the delimiters (say, parentheses) to be out-of-band characters. so they're not allowed in binary blobs. this saves you from all sorts of escaping exploits (think XSS), makes resyncing more efficient and parsing a lot easier. of course it's really hard to step out of the ""we really need all 8 bits in a byte""-paradigm, or how else can you design data formats with out-of-band characters? I don't know, and the talk I watched didn't give a solution either, just that it would be a good idea (to which I agree).",1358793438

Its description of public schools in the south sets the scene for today's legacy:<p>""The poverty of the South and the blindness of its planter-dominated leadership to the need for an educated labor force made the region the educational backwater of the country. School expenditures per pupil in Georgia in 1940, for example, were 42 percent of the national average; they were even lower in Alabama, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Those were figures for both black and white students; blacks of course fared worse than whites. Thus, in 1940, Alabama spent 3.2 times as much per pupil on whites as on blacks; Georgia 3.3 times as much; South Carolina 3.8 times as much; Mississippi a staggering 7.2 times as much. In the most heavily black counties of the Black Belt (so-called because of the exceptionally rich dark soil), per-pupil expenditures for black children were less than one-thirteenth of what was spent on whites. A pamphlet documenting such inequalities issued by the National Conference of Fundamental Problems in the Education of Negroes in 1934 observed wryly that 'if we assume the democratic principle of equal educational opportunity for all children, it would appear that it takes seven times as much to teach a white child as a Negro. As Booker T. Washington used to say, it is too great a compliment to the Negro to assume that he can learn seven times as easily as his white neighbor.'""<p>As that book points out, and as Roland Fryer points out in his more recent publication, today spending disparities are nowhere near that large (although they still favor ""white"" students in most jurisdictions), and now cultural factors and specific school practices are most at issue in the current divide. But the divide is narrowing, and has narrowed quite a bit in my lifetime, and there are identifiable improvements in United States schools that could make it narrow further.<p>On the language background of Americans, see<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/opinion/sunday/are-we-really-monolingual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/opinion/sunday/are-we-real...</a><p>for a recent report, based on the United States Census data, and an earlier Gallup Poll result<p><a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/1825/about-one-four-americans-can-hold-conversation-second-language.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/1825/about-one-four-americans-can...</a><p>with different methodology. I had three grandparents, all born in the United States, who spoke a language other than English at home. The United States has long relied on immigrant families keeping their heritage languages (as in the case of my grandparents' families) to have people in the population who speak a language other than English. I have been a contract English-Chinese interpreter for the United States government and other clients. By test, I reached a high level of proficiency in a second language. But I would see highly proficient English in use among mixed groups of young people from other countries throughout the time I lived in Taiwan, and there is no comparable phenomenon of anywhere near as many Americans who grow up in English-speaking homes learning a second language of any kind. Singapore, by contrast, has four official languages from four different language families, has a population that spoke NONE of those official languages at home as recently as a generation ago, and yet has achieved good educational results in English (the sole medium of primary and secondary schooling) during my lifetime. Singapore is a very diverse country that has been more successful in getting good schooling results for that diverse population than the United States has. Similarly, repeating my previous comment here, my wife used a second language (Mandarin) to receive all of her schooling, and then learned a non-cognate foreign language (English) beginning in secondary schooling, and so is genuinely trilingual, a rare condition among Americans in her generation.",1358792707

5092796,comment,5091915,5091915,4,0,antics,,,"Chomsky's argument here is basically the same argument he used to reinvent linguistics in the 50's and 60's, so understanding what's <i>really</i> being said here depends on a bit of context. Since neither previous discussions nor this article has quite nailed it, the discussion is indeed worth having (sorry, ColinWright).<p>The crux of the debate is this. When Chomsky was a grad student at UPenn most linguists thought that language was learned by a complicated mimicry -- that we learn language by imitating behavior, similar to how birds learn to call. The ""hard problems"" of linguistics were completely solved and linguistics had become a primarily classificatory science, with linguists simply cataloging words into parts of speech. This line of thought was interchangeably known as behavioralism or empiricism.<p>One of Chomsky's transformative insights was that most sentences that are reasonably long are completely unique in human history, and will also never again be uttered by another person, ever. (For example, try Googling that exact sentence.) One consequence of this is that people realized that the mimicry argument could not really account for the robust well-formed structure of sentences <i>and</i> give us an infinite set of them. What we need to generate an infinite set of well-structured sentences is a <i>grammar</i>. Thus the universal grammar was born, and while Chomsky did not convince all the prominent linguists of the time, he did convince all their grad students, and the field of linguistics has seldom looked back.<p>Where this begins to intersect with AI is where Chomsky is usually criticized for not having been quite revolutionary enough. His outline of linguistics basically split the field into semantics (which studies the <i>meaning</i> of language) and syntax (which studies the <i>structure</i> of language). He argued that everything about language that must be interpreted (like meaning) must go on the semantics side of the line, and everything else should go on the other side of the line. He does not believe syntax to be interpretive at all, and tends to react violently when anyone tries to push empiricism into the syntax dialogue. Even a lot of his students don't buy that syntax is completely not-interpretive, and so someone like Lakoff would claim that if he was revolutionary, he was not quite revolutionary enough.<p>Here's what this means for AI. Chomsky sees the statistical approach to learning as a type of empiricism. You take a corpus, learn some stuff statistically, and then perform well on a task. To someone like Chomsky this probably looks like Skinner's old model, but instead of words like ""mimicry"", we use words like ""statistical inference."" Remember that empiricism and syntax should be strictly separate, and it becomes easy to see why something like this would make him cranky.<p>Of course, computer scientists like Norvig and linguists like Lakoff disagree. Their collective argument is that some aspects of syntax are indeed interpretive, and that (in the case of Norvig) they can be learned statistically (using, e.g., PCFGs). For example consider the sentence ""John called Mary a Republican and then SHE insulted HIM"". This really only makes sense if you presume that the participants think that ""Republican"" is an insult, but how do you know that? The answer seems to be through some sort of past experience, which Norvig would say can be and should be modeled statistically. And that in short is the debate and why it exists.<p>The other complaints with what Chomsky said here are that it's scientifically incorrect. Chomsky claimed, for example, that statistical models are basically not real science, and not used in the history of science, which is obviously wrong. Norvig pointed out, for example, that in physics sometimes our only choice is to infer something statistically, as in the case of the gravitational constant or the Higgs boson. But given Chomsky's history, it's fair to assume he meant this in the context of behavioral science, in which case his point is mostly true (modulo the ""old"" model of linguistics, which he hates). But of course it's important to remember that his model of linguistics was also without precedent in the history of science, so that alone is not really justification for his position.",1358792427

Visiting them would be to revisit some of the worst horrors of the 20th century as seen in Nazi death camps or Stalinist gulags. The only reasons why these horrors haven't driven the west to action are that information about these camps are very difficult to get out and also there is very little we could do about the problem without causing millions of deaths (of South Koreans too) in the process.",1358792365

5092711,story,,,324,180,pg,"What we discovered about InstallMonetizer",,"Last week there was some controversy online about a company we
funded called InstallMonetizer.  IM makes software that companies
can put in their Windows installers that offers other software to
the user as part of the install process.<p>It's unclear exactly how much of a right we as investors have to
tell the companies we fund what to do.  But on the other hand we
don't like the idea that someone we funded might be doing something
illicit, so we felt like we should at least investigate the claims
and if there was a problem, try to convince IM to fix it.<p>Here's a list of things people said about IM or similar products,
and what we discovered about each:<p>1. They make ""drive-by installers.""  A drive-by installer installs
software without the user's knowledge.  This accusation is false.
Other companies in this business do such things, but IM doesn't.
Every IM install screen has a decline as well as an accept button,
and if the user declines, no software is installed.<p>2. The apps that get installed are ""crapware.""  This one seems a
matter of opinion.  A lot of the world's most popular apps and sites
seem like junk to us.  But the users are choosing to install these
things.<p>3. IM ""monitors and uploads users ongoing usage activity of the
bundled crapware.""  This fact is disclosed in the IM EULA (which
admittedly probably no one reads), but more importantly isn't used
for any money-making purpose.  The usage info is (a) collected only
for the first 30 minutes and (b) is only used to prove to the
advertiser that the install is by a human and not a bot.<p>4. ""This surprisingly includes not only IP but the globally unique
MAC addresses.""  This information also isn't used for marketing
purposes, only if advertisers request it to clear up discrepancies
in dowload figures.  We asked IM to switch to uploading hashes of
the IP and MAC address instead, and they are going to start doing
that.<p>5. Comments on HN mentioned that a lot of companies in this business
wrap OSS in violation of the license terms.  When we asked IM, they
scanned their publishers and found that 6% of them were doing this.
Those publishers have been banned from using IM, and all future
publishers will be thoroughly screened for ownership of their
software.<p>6. Comments on HN also pointed out that some apps installed by this
type of installer are excessively hard to uninstall-- e.g.  because
when you try to uninstall them, they re-install themselves.  This
again is something that while common practice in this industry, IM
won't do.  They ban advertisers who do such things.",1358791390

Companies making money across borders can pay their corporate taxes elsewhere, wherever is more convenient, sometimes in the US, sometimes in Ireland, etc. This is not specific to Google or Facebook.

While Koreans are militarily <i>ahem</i> enthusiastic, it's not that Korea is the crazy man of Asia, prone to belligerence and expansionism.

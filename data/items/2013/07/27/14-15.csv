It will help you learn about different things such as minifying, concatenation and caching.<p>At least in the Case Study homepage, there is a lot of commented out markup in the source, and an entire section where it looks like it was done in an HTML generator - because you are not using the Cascade at all, and every link re declares the same font-family over and over.<p>Something else you should consider is looking into this course:  <a href=""http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/</a><p>It will help you understand what is going on when debugging webpages.<p>I know it&#x27;s hard to be doing stuff that likely few people your age can relate to.

Natural selection happens immediately, valuable life preserving mutations are suppose occur (typically) over thousands of years.<p>To illustrate Arctic terns are dying because they are not able to adapt to climate change.\nArctic terns eat herrings a cold water fish, as the water gets warmer, these fish seek colder waters, possible\nby going deeper in the waters. According to biologist other birds in the Arctic can dive deeper to grab the cold water fish Arctic terns cannot, so they and their chicks starve to death.

6113057,comment,6112467,6112467,9,0,killahpriest,,,"tl;dr Programming has been ignored because hardware has a much more visible payoff. The impact of computers and the innovation in hardware will &quot;be but a ripple on the surface of our culture, compared with the much more profound influence they will have in their capacity of intellectual challenge without precedent in the cultural history of mankind.&quot; That is, the intellectual impact of programming is more significant than the impact made innovation on the hardware side. At least thats what I think what Dijkstra is saying.<p>Some gems:<p>Test driven development, 1972.<p><i></i><i>Today a usual technique is to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness. But one should not first make the program and then prove its correctness, because then the requirement of providing the proof would only increase the poor programmers burden. On the contrary: the programmer should let correctness proof and program grow hand in hand.</i><i></i><p>For loops have brain damaged us.<p><i></i><i>Another lesson we should have learned from the recent past is that the development of richer or more powerful programming languages was a mistake in the sense that these baroque monstrosities, these conglomerations of idiosyncrasies, are really unmanageable, both mechanically and mentally. I see a great future for very systematic and very modest programming languages. When I say modest, I mean that, for instance, not only ALGOL 60s for clause, but even FORTRANs DO loop may find themselves thrown out as being too baroque. I have run a a little programming experiment with really experienced volunteers, but something quite unintended and quite unexpected turned up. None of my volunteers found the obvious and most elegant solution. Upon closer analysis this turned out to have a common source: their notion of repetition was so tightly connected to the idea of an associated controlled variable to be stepped up, that they were mentally blocked from seeing the obvious. Their solutions were less efficient, needlessly hard to understand, and it took them a very long time to find them.</i><i></i>",1374936637

It&#x27;s one thing to take on card issuers but you can&#x27;t just write a letter like Dr Anderson&#x27;s to the High Court and expect them to say, &quot;well that&#x27;s OK then&quot;. That&#x27;s called contempt of court and it&#x27;s a crime everywhere in the world.<p>Dr Anderson has reportedly been injuncted on other occasions[0] but those don&#x27;t seem to relate to chip and PIN.<p>I think that the intrusion into academic freedom is lamentable but without any link to the case documents it&#x27;s hard to say exactly on what basis the interim decision was made. In any event as it&#x27;s only an interim injunction it may well be overturned at full trial.<p>My two cents is that the case for disclosure here, while instinctively convincing, is not as urgent as it has been with the vulnerabilities revealed in financial systems. In those cases, for example, banks were refusing to repay money stolen from individuals on the basis that the banks&#x27; systems were secure so it must have been the customers at fault. Dr Anderson and others were extremely convincing in showing that this was not necessarily the case. (I don&#x27;t know if that has filtered through to the financial world at large - are people still being told there are no security holes?)<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t feel that bad about people having their Bentleys stolen but probably we can wait for trial here (assuming it&#x27;s not just a strategy by the car manufacturers to bankrupt or intimidate the academics involved).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/24/citibank_gags_crypto_researchers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/02/24/citibank_gags_crypto...</a>",1374936419

Part of the reason I haven&#x27;t gotten into haskell is because as you said, it &quot;isn&#x27;t quite there yet&quot;. Common Lisp has the added quality that an error trows you into the debugger, and that it makes errors much less punishing. If there is one lesson I&#x27;ve learned from gaming is that hard games don&#x27;t repel the players if errors are easy to recover from and you aren&#x27;t psychologically punished for them. Haskell isn&#x27;t exactly a shining example of that, despite it&#x27;s other great qualities. You want to make the teaching material challenging, not punishing(a great example of this is the game super meat boy).<p>Not to mention the traditional argument for lisp as a teaching language: the extremely simple syntax. For somebody who hasn&#x27;t seen code before, lisp would look <i>just</i> as weird as any other language, so the unfamiliarity argument doesn&#x27;t hold much water. Prefix notation isn&#x27;t at all difficult to learn, (+ 1 2) would be just as weird as dividing using / or multiplying with *, and using % for modulo division.

No one chooses one company over another because that company makes more profit.

People want devices that just works, especially if those devices are built to make their lives easier, not harder.

Android would&#x27;ve had the same success if it was as closed as iOS.<p>In the general scheme of things, I agree with you. Android is not completely open and definitely not a free software, but it is better for consumers than iOS (and I&#x27;m an iOS user).

The tone accompanying an article such as this inevitably vilifies those who consume such material, as though this is a clear moral issue. This implies all of us have pedophilic urges, with only those who lack the moral fortitude to resist going on to seek out child porn. But this is not accurate -- I don&#x27;t have the least desire to view such images, but instead feel a visceral disgust. Most others, I imagine, have the same reaction.<p>People who <i>want</i> to view sexually explicit images of children are sick, not immoral. They suffer from a deviant urge from which the rest of us are free. The issue, then, should not be how to punish them, but how to cure them of this urge. (Whether such a cure is possible is another matter altogether -- our sexual desires exert regrettable power over our behaviours.) In conjunction, we must do everything we can to halt the dissemination of such material, just as Microsoft is doing here. By shifting our reaction from wanting to punish consumers of child porn to wanting to rehabilitate them, we will encourage more to come forward for treatment, ultimately reducing the amount of such material that is consumed, and thus the number of children harmed in its creation.",1374933673

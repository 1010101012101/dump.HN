Nick didn&#x27;t remove electronics from his carry-on which is what initially got him singled out (&quot;behind the glass partition&quot;). This happens all the time, completely mundane. Then during that screening they found his pockets were stuffed with paper with indistinguishable Arabic writing and English words like bomb, kidnap, etc.<p>So now Nick has failed to follow all the basic instructions (empty pockets, electronics out) and he&#x27;s got a pocket full of What The Fuck.<p>If Nick pays any attention in the security line that day and follows simple instructions none of this happens.<p>As usual, his rights were not violated until the police showed up. Only at that moment do I concede anything wrong happened.<p>If you think about it, either TSA is a glorified toiletry inspector, or they are trying to use their brains to deduce who should be screened more thoroughly. If we ask them to use their brains, and given as a society we don&#x27;t want our Elon Musks of the world as TSA agents, you tell these agents to look for certain flags and then tell them they must call for help. That&#x27;s exactly what Jane Doe TSA agent did.

Turning a piece of paper (ie: a paycheque) into cash costs money and so does turning cash into a piece of paper (ie: a money order to pay rent or a utility bill). The banking system isn&#x27;t free. It is much more profitable for the bank to prey on the poor who have no capital to offer up and who have no time to research their different banking options than it is for a bank to offer affordable services to low-income customers. Cash costs money to mint and print as well but that&#x27;s hidden in seigniorage, taxes and inflation.<p>There are payroll cards (in lieu of cheques) for employees without bank accounts but, since the card issuer&#x27;s true customer is the employer, they often hit employees with high fees for everything which end up costing more than a bank account would.",1422229622

Why is this style of working so unpopular between employers?</i><p>I have seen companies on both sides, where remote work is successful and where it fails, and where it is successful, it is built into the business model, starting from the hiring process, to select individuals who are technically competent, and who also have demonstrated the ability to work independently. This severely limits the number of people that qualify, and limits the company&#x27;s ability to grow aggressively. Some companies do not have the option of slow-and-steady growth, due to investor involvement. Most others are going to prefer reasonably aggressive growth (more money), and that means foregoing remote work in favor of hiring workers who are more easily replaceable. If a company can hire from the pool of workers who are technically competent, but who need a little oversight to stay productive, and that process works to produce the output needed, then that is much easier to achieve than having a long and expensive hiring process where the company delays growth while waiting for the perfect new hire.<p><i>>There are less distractions when you work from home.</i><p>For a lot of people, this is not true. Where it is true, it&#x27;s still difficult to justify a remote work policy. Distractions can come from a significant other, kids, pets, roommates, a TV, or internet access. If you are single with no kids or pets and live alone, it&#x27;s true you at least have control over most of your distractions. In situations where the quantity of distractions is fewer, there are still distractions that the employer has no way of detecting and managing. Suppose your coworker chooses to watch TV while he works, which leads him to write code with more bugs. He still hits the number of commits (or whatever metric), but his reduced productivity is difficult to detect and correct. What if you are unusually disciplined, and your estimate of other people&#x27;s discipline is wrong by a significant margin? In that case, everyone working from home could be a huge hit to productivity. The employer can&#x27;t have a policy of, &quot;All single employees without kids, pets, or roommates, and who are also very disciplined, may work from home.&quot; As someone who does work from home 2-3 days per week, and who also has a spouse, a kid, 2 dogs, TV, and internet, I find that there are a lot of days when I&#x27;m working from home that I would have gotten significantly more done at our office.<p><i>>Some bosses _need_ to see you in the office otherwise they feel uneasy and lose sense of control over a team. This is both funny and sad..</i><p>This is probably not the man keeping you down, or a twisted need for control, or whatever. This probably has much more to do with the chosen business model, and the fact that most employees are not going to be a good fit for remote work. While you may be the ideal case, that is definitely not the norm. The company has to set policies based on all employees, and unfortunately that means the weakest link wins.",1422228078

It would likely just be a landing page with an overview of services, and a contact form or phone number, I&#x27;ve received some validation on my concept in the form of an HR manager saying to come back in Q2 and they&#x27;ll have the budget to talk about signing an agreement.  So if anything, it&#x27;d be a very temporary site until successfully closing my first client.<p>I&#x27;m not selling a consumable product, nor is it SaaS, just an outsourced business process and I can swallow $50 much more easily than the costs for a designer to put together the type of site I&#x27;d be looking for.<p>Any feedback would be immensely appreciated!",1422227629

Gox failed, so it&#x27;s a real concern. No one should keep their coins in any wallet except their own, and they need to make sure they have the technical understanding of how to properly manage their wallet.  If your personal wallet isn&#x27;t encrypted and backed up, it&#x27;s not managed properly.<p>If you want to store coins on someone&#x27;s exchange or webwallet, never store more than 25% of what you&#x27;re comfortable with losing.  (It turns out that &quot;what you&#x27;re comfortable with losing&quot; is way, way more than the reality of waking up one day and realizing you&#x27;ve lost it all.)<p>This is an interesting move, but I&#x27;m worried that these new exchanges will increase the attack surface of Bitcoin&#x27;s reputation.  If the new ones fail, it will shake the public&#x27;s confidence in Bitcoin yet again.  Not that that matters, since Bitcoin seems to go along fine whether or not people are confident in it.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether it would even be possible to insure against losing all cold storage reserves, but nobody should trust large sums to any webwallet (including Coinbase&#x27;s current website, BTC-e, Bitstamp, etc) until protection against that worst-case scenario is in place.<p>EDIT:  From the paywalled article:<p><i>The exchange could bring needed legitimacy to the currency, which isn’t backed by a central government and is traded over virtual exchanges, primarily overseas. Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money won’t disappear.</i><p>Until details about this insurance are released, do not trust large sums to Coinbase or anyone else.  And unless the insurance protects against every coin disappearing tomorrow, never trust them at all. Trusting them is equivalent to gambling your savings for no benefit.",1422227199

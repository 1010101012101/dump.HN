4227496,comment,4226569,4226569,1,0,Athens79,,,"1) Developers will probably not make any money on games for it. Its a problem for Android too. Many good iOS games will never be ported over to Android because of this. And some developers have left Android after products didn't make any money. Its a culture problem, plus pirates made it a terrible market to make money\n2) Open system easy to hack, its going to rub FPS multi-player games useless. Its already killing the PC gaming of that type. \n3) Licenses and patents, and honestly I can't see those specs being sold at that $99 price tag period. \n4) Lack of marketing ability to attract the players to make the market large enough to attract developers\n5) The few open source titles that are decent games are so late 1990's quality in graphics. Though graphics are very highly over rated, game play is much more important and there just isn't that many with great game play.\n6) Intense pressure from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo will knock it down in lawsuits if it ever did gain traction. Or just out right buy the company to kill it. \n7) As mobile phones continue to push the envelope in performance, the few good games it might be able to offer will evolve around those more powerful phones and will probably leave that thing in the dust with ability to play games a year or 2 down the road. Mobile gaming ability and phone power is increasing exponentially, unlike the slow pace of desktops which had that kind of growth a decade ago. \n8) When they do start having to make good money to solve these problems, to cover costs of the machine, litigation's, patients, paying developers to make games worthy enough to attract paying customers, the very people it cater to that nitch Linux Open blah blah group will turn away from it.<p>This is why desktop gaming has always been the domain of Windows PC's, and for mobile its the domain of iOS and for portable its still a nice race between Sony and Nintendo, both of which is hurting over iOS gaming.",1341975269

As in, here, there is a fairly constant 100 players per sq km. Rather I see hubs forming (maybe with some power law distribution) -- maybe a large city, market, planetary system, ring of hell, a battlefield that would disproportion ally hold a large number of entities vs other ares.<p>There then instead of node ownership based on the space grid, you'd want to somehow have node ownership based on clustering/density.<p>So maybe constantly iterate a K-means clustering algorithm, where servers are cluster centers and every player/client in the cluster belongs to that server.<p>That would be my back of the envelope approach.

4227477,comment,4225651,4227227,2,0,dmlorenzetti,,,"I agree that knowledge of computer science doesn't transfer directly to climate science.  However, there's a lot about computer science that may help understand how climate models yield probabilistic outcomes (Monte Carlo, anyone?).<p>On the subject, be a little careful equating probabilistic models and statistical models.  At least in my experience, ""statistical models"" generally describes statistical fits to past data.  Think of a polynomial whose parameters are chosen by least-squares fit to previous observations.  These fits can be used to interpolate or extrapolate (to the future, or to different combinations of inputs).  However, they don't encode any domain knowledge, and they can be extremely brittle when pushed outside the regimes from which they were derived.<p>Most climate models, on the other hand, are deterministic, physics-based models.  Some of the sub-models may have statistical fits in them, but the modeling is largely driven by some conceptual framework of how the physics drive the dynamic system (e.g., expressing conservation of mass and energy, and how spatial differences drive transport).<p>Those deterministic climate models can be driven probabilistically-- meaning the uncertain inputs and parameters can be sampled from distributions of likely values.  Aggregating all the results gives a probabilistic prediction.  A lot of climate reports take this one step further, and aggregate results across multiple models.  Most computer scientists will immediately ""get"" this part, even if they don't understand all the physics represented in the individual packages.",1341974696

Of course, in some cases if you only consider price this is debatable, but in many more cases, humans really do win.<p>Why? Because there is a lot of flight data and there is a material cost to performing a search. If you want a 6-Continent RTW trip, a flight search engine can't run 1,000,000 queries just to find you the cheapest route. The data providers impose pretty tight limits. When you hit those limits in aggregate, you risk very high costs.<p>Apart from that, and most importantly, humans have a wealth of knowledge that simply isn't catalogued. That's because it's too broad, too often changing, too obscure, or the airlines don't want OTAs to use that info; e.g. award flight availability across all airlines.<p>Our challenge now is to expand into many of these non-price factors and offer value even for short trips where we can't beat airline advertised prices. But as you can imagine, in its current state, Flightfox really comes into its own for complicated flights, even if just slightly complex.<p>The posted contest really beats anything on the web by a large amount. 6 continents for $1730 is pretty remarkable, or at least we think. It's not us who found it, it's our experts, who are the fabric of Flightfox.<p>Hope that helps.",1341972979

Maybe I'm a but more of a heavy user than normal but I have 500k files in dropbox going a little over 70gb and recently indexing even a few hundred more small files is painfully slow and the hard drive is constantly thrashing (so slow that I've had to turn dropbox off while working as the computer is almost unusable).<p>It seems indexing speed has become slower and slower the more files I already have in my dropboc. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm on windows 7 with a standard 7200 rpm HDD (only 18 months old too). The pc runs nice and fast when dropbox is closed.",1341972622

You can at least screen for the mutations, but predicting how the drugs will act in the human body (especially in combination) is much tougher.<p>However, with many forms of cancer, there are very few options, so higher risk method of treatment are much more tolerable.",1341972608

You are not using the right unicode. Try another unicode.",1341972504

I don't want to be dramatic, but take current events into account (Julian Assange, the NDAA, Guantanamo). There is plenty of abuse.<p>The question is not whether people used Mega Upload for piracy, its whether or not their service complied with the law (DMCA). For example: if I mail narcotics, is the Post Office breaking the law? If I Drop Box a pirated movie to a friend, is Drop Box breaking the law? Plenty of people email files around, do you think Google checks for/blocks any pirated attachments? Youtube? Come on, what song can't you find on youtube uploaded by some random person who added the lyrics. I'd be willing to bet that much more ""pirated content"" is streamed through youtube than ever was through MU.<p>What would you think if China extradited Sergey because people are uploading Chinese artists' music to youtube?<p>The fact that so many used it for pirated content is only a testament to how easy and scalable his file sharing/transferring service was and their effort to protect their user's privacy.\nPrivacy means a lot to quite a bit of people, me included.",1341972485

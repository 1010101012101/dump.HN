Nevertheless I hope this clears it up for you:<p>---<p>Advertising is meant to gain your attention. This is not a secret conspiracy, it is quite literally the entire business. That being said, there is vast differential in the amount of energy expended in ignoring content vs the amount needed to make a willful decision of how to value and purchase said content.<p>Subscriptions are actually even harder to decide on because they are a much higher cost that requires a commitment with a single outlet and trust that their quality will continue to be to your liking vs a single article.<p>Patreon is not an alternative funding model - it is still direct payment/funds transfer. It&#x27;s just optional. It&#x27;s also not viable for any scalable business. Not everything can or should be a small little site.<p>Advertising is packaged with content because the publisher owns the right to that content and how it&#x27;s distributed. This is the same in every other medium ever invented. Same with any other product you buy. You get it as it comes. If you&#x27;re not compensating that advertiser for that content directly, then they have every right to include advertising to offset the cost of creating and distributing that content to you which you requested. Would you rather they deny your request?<p>Everything is a security risk. You should stay in a nuclear bunker and off the internet to truly minimize surface area. However that&#x27;s not realistic. Ad networks definitely have an implementation problem with not enough standards on malware testing, and yes they&#x27;re a good choice because of their scale. However guns are also efficient at killing and cars are efficient at escaping, should we also get rid of both because they&#x27;re used by criminals?<p>Any database containing data and thus value becomes a target. Should we also stop creating any kind of database because it might become a potential target? So medical records, court proceedings, tax records, insurance claims and every other database should immediately be destroyed because someone might want to access it? Again the real problem here is the fact that criminals will be criminals, not the tools they use or targets they go after. There should absolutely be more safeguards with ad networks along with liability as I&#x27;ve stated in previous posts (and I&#x27;m doing my best to make that happen) but arguing that we should get rid of the advertising model because of some security issues does not make sense.",1450727875

10773058,comment,10770332,10772832,0,0,ralmidani,,,"A little bit of background: I learned Django first. Then I learned Rails via Code School, and flirted with building my app with Rails instead of Django. I saw the asset pipeline specifically as a Rails advantage over Django (I write Emblem, indented Sass, and CoffeeScript whenever I can avoid HTML/Handlebars, CSS, and JS). Also, building JSON APIs with Rails has better out-of-the-box support than it does in Django.<p>I always felt Rails&#x27; model layer is clunky compared to Django&#x27;s. What is the definitive representation of my model? The validations in SomeModel < ActiveRecord::Base or what&#x27;s automatically generated in schema.rb when I run migrations via Rake? In Django everything, including migrations (in simple cases), is derived from the classes in models.py. But I thought it would be worth it to persevere, due to the above-mentioned advantages.<p>Then I realized I could (and should) compile assets via Ember-CLI, and Django Rest Framework is just a pip install away. So the two main advantages of Rails disappeared, and switching back to Django became, for me, a no-brainer.<p>Edit: I also prefer Django&#x27;s less magical approach.

The compiler does not need to consider undefined behavior <i>at all</i>.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have an explicit case for &quot;undefined, choose a behavior&quot;; it can simply act as though undefined behavior does not exist, and have the behavior in that case depend on whatever the code written to handle defined behavior happens to do in the undefined case.<p>[EDIT: This example is unspecified behavior, not undefined behavior.  The example does still illustrate what I meant by behavior that arises out of the compiler implementation without explicit notice by the compiler.]<p>For instance, if you write f(g(), h()), C doesn&#x27;t specify whether g or h gets called first.  The compiler doesn&#x27;t explicitly parse that whole expression and internally note &quot;oh, you have unspecified behavior here, I&#x27;ll silently choose an interpretation and not tell you about it&quot;.  The compiler just parses the expression and breaks it down into sequential operations, implicitly choosing an interpretation based on its parsing, evaluation, and optimization.  The compiler might evaluate g() first because it parses left-to-right, or h() first because it parses right-to-left, or h() first because h() was an inline function and it expands those first...<p>A compiler explicitly designed to flag undefined behaviors would need to have additional logic to notice undefined behaviors; you couldn&#x27;t just take an existing compiler and find all the places where it <i>explicitly</i> notices undefined behavior and chooses a way to handle it.<p>Existing compilers have started to add warnings for cases where they explicitly <i>exploit</i> undefined behavior for optimization, such as assuming a lack of signed overflow, or assuming that you never dereference a NULL pointer.  But retrofitting a compiler to flag cases where it currently just doesn&#x27;t even consider the undefined behavior would require far more work.",1450727775

Even being older, empaths are the perfect codependent counter type for narcissists and other wise sociopaths and psychopaths. They have affective empathy (empty shallow charming ability to pretend to have emptathy) but crave raw empathy which is what aspie girls have an abundance of (google intense world theory, applies to both male and females for autism). This coupled with (I edited in my original comment in more detail) a females aspies or any autistic females tendency to be just incredibly naive about peoples emotions and their intentions, is a disaster waiting to happen.<p>Going to school in a male dominated environment with an unusual number of anti social personalities (introverts --> engineering...) I was the perfect target so sociopathic men and there were alot of them around me. It&#x27;s not surprising in RETROSPECT that a year ago I got out of a long term relationship with a verifiable sociopath for all the reasons I just said.<p>After educating myself about all of this I wish I had read some of these aspie books for young females when I was younger and I could have protected myself from a lot of toxic situations.<p>Now, I volunteer in aspie programs teaching young girls how to code. Alot of aspie women can&#x27;t keep good jobs because they are &quot;rude and bossy&quot; or not charming enough or &quot;creepy and quiet&quot;. Luckily for me my skill set is in high need and objectively evaluated for the most part (can&#x27;t argue with me if I produce your code on time) so I thought it would be incredibly empowering to build girls with this confidence and self esteem, and potentially the ability to arm themselves with solid careers/technical skillsets that overpower an HR departments ability for a 26 yr old girl wearing designer clothes and paid to be charming to evaluate a nerdy antisocial girl on her &quot;overall performance&quot; if actually she is an objectively solid and valued individual contributer and has code to show it.<p>If she is young I would recommend fostering her hobbies as much as possible and encouraging &quot;structured playtime&quot; for whatever her interests are. With channeling and encouragement (for all the people who post successful autistic women as a reason to doubt they have it at all) aspies including aspie girls can become MASTERS at the things they are obsessed with.<p>Turns out, successful people are typically successfully because they love what they do, they have infectious passion and they are GOOD at it, and can spend hours uninterupted developing their product or building their empire, so actually aspie women are the perfect character trait combination then for successful people, if they can have emotional support through their difficulties with social interactions while being encouraged to do what other people call &quot;active but odd obsessions&quot; because that could be the talent that makes or inspires her career one day, or maybe even her company that she starts.",1450727540

Many people here will speak eloquently about how wonderful proof assistants are, and how lamentable it is that modern mathematicians don&#x27;t use them, but then it usually transpires that they themselves are <i>not</i> mathematicians, and really don&#x27;t have a clue about just how free form mathematics is when practised at the highest levels.<p>I&#x27;m sure computer assisted and computer annotated proofs will advance marvellously over the coming decades, but it seems incomprehensible to me that modern research mathematics could be done within that framework.<p>It would be interesting to be proved wrong, but it seems that the skills required to use the current level of proof assistants would be much like asking modern web programmers to use front panel toggle switches.  Toy programs would be onerous, but possible.  Anything with any real content would require specialists in the assistant language.  Suddenly you&#x27;re asking mathematicians to be programmers as well, albeit in a specialised language.<p>From what I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s still like programming in assembler.  Or worse.  I&#x27;ve seen and have had some training in proof-assistant languages, and at their current status it just seems hopeless for real work.<p>I look forward to seeing how it will develop over the coming decades, although I doubt I will still be a working programmer, or mathematician, by the time it becomes possible to express mathematics at the highest level in proof assistant languages.<p>Despite disagreeing with it, here is the text:<p><pre><code>  ================================================================\n\n  Imagine if I asked you to learn a programing language and a culture of practices\n  where:\n\n  - All the variables were a single letter, pathologically so, and that programmers\n    enjoyed using foreign alphabets, glyph variation and fonts to disambiguate their\n    code from meaningless gibberish.\n\n  - None of the functions were documented independently, and instead the API\n    documentation consisted of circular references to other pieces of similar\n    code, often with the same names overloaded into multiple meanings, often\n    impossible to Google.\n\n  - None of the sample code could be run on a typical computer, in fact, most\n    of it was pseudo-code lacking a clear definition of input and output, or\n    even the environment and domain in which it is typically expected to be run.\n\n  - Expressive code in this language was impossible to write in a typical text\n    editor or word processor, and transcribing code from paper back into something\n    useful was an error-prone process.\n\n  - Papers describing novel ideas in the field were incomprehensible by default,\n    so that the world&#x27;s most established experts on the subject would need years\n    to decide whether a particularly cutting-edge program is meaningful or in\n    fact insane gibberish.\n\n  - These experts not only see nothing wrong with this picture, but in fact,\n    revel in symbolic obscurity and ego-driven naming, dismissing sincere\n    attempts at fixing these deep seated problems as meaningless taste arguments\n    or pointless pop culture entertainment.\n\n  If you were an experienced programmer. you would rightly call me insane.\n\n  If you were a mathematician, it would be a day ending in y.\n\n  ================================================================</code></pre>",1450727420

And the credit-reporting agencies don&#x27;t think that way.<p>The thing about credit event streams is that they&#x27;re very low-detail: basically they amount to, for each credit instrument you have, a series of {pay-period, code} pairs with nine possible codes, R1-R9. Your score is entirely calculated† by taking (a seven-year sliding window of) those event-codes and applying weights to them. R1, the most-positively-weighted event, just means &quot;paid on time this month.&quot;<p>The thing you want to do to build good credit quickly, is to generate <i>as many R1 events as you can</i>. You <i>can</i> carry some of your debt on a card to &quot;stretch&quot; one large charge into multiple R1 events... but a more efficient strategy (that doesn&#x27;t involve paying any interest) is to simply have several cards, use them all for at least one trifling thing each month, and then pay them <i>all</i> off each month. Three cards you paid off $5 charges on is three R1s, and counts for <i>just as much</i> as one $500 charge you paid in three instalments (also three R1s.)<p>If you want to dig in and see exactly how much information a CRA will give you, here&#x27;s a Ruby implementation of the Experian Connect API: <a href=""https://github.com/ehutzelman/experian"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ehutzelman/experian</a><p>---<p>† Well, okay, there&#x27;s also two other things:<p>1. a positively-weighted factor for how much unused credit each instrument holds each month. Which usually translates to &quot;you get punished for carrying an 80%+ balance on a credit card.&quot; The key with this one is that—all else being equal—it&#x27;s better to have cards with higher credit limits, because then you&#x27;re not using as much of each instrument&#x27;s capacity, and that reflects better on you.<p>2. a negatively-weighted factor for any &quot;hard inquiries&quot; that the credit-reporting agency had to respond to within some time window. Each time you apply for a credit instrument and the loaning institution asks the reporting agency to calculate your credit score <i>for the purpose of determining credit eligibility</i>, that&#x27;s a &quot;hard inquiry&quot; event. (You can think of these as their own credit event on a &quot;meta&quot; instrument held by the reporting agency itself.) Unlike normal credit instruments, there are no industry standards on how to set the weights or time-window for the effects of &quot;hard inquiries&quot;, but the windows are <i>usually</i> short (~6 months), AFAIK. All else being equal, don&#x27;t quickly, repeatedly apply for credit: each successive loaning institution will see a lower score. (And note the &quot;for the purpose of determining credit eligibility&quot; bit. There&#x27;s another kind of event, a &quot;soft inquiry&quot;, that happens when you—or some third-party on your behalf—just asks the reporting agency for your credit score in order to know it, or background-check you, or whatever else. I&#x27;m pretty sure none of the big three CRAs in the US give any weight to a &quot;soft inquiry&quot; event.)",1450727403

You&#x27;re looking for a very gross upper bound. In that case, I could say that proof that human behavior is unchangeable would also convince me.<p>But I&#x27;d go one step further -- if low IQ was shown to be the main cause of poverty, I would change my views, too. Not on the necessity of a solution (I mean, we&#x27;re also genetically incapable of flying, but that didn&#x27;t stop us from building airplanes) but on the kind solution we need.<p>> I asked you what evidence could change your views. Had you stated concrete measurements then I&#x27;d have had to change my theory. Since my theory predicted reality perfectly I don&#x27;t need to change it.<p>Ah, so let me question your powers of deduction. When I said &quot;anything that would show that no human action would change the poor&#x27;s fortunes&quot; you <i>assumed</i> I was stating a tautology because you chose to interpret my words that way; that is not the only interpretation, though (and in this case, it was the wrong one). If, you had chosen to assume that I wouldn&#x27;t be so stupid as to offer a tautology (which I am not), you would have realized I meant something else altogether: that proving an impossibility result is very hard, and either requires lots and lots of different kinds of evidence, or a completely irrelevant upper bound -- as in your speed of light example (and I admit that I chose that example precisely because I knew you would come up with the speed of light) -- that is known to be false in both the Atlantic-crossing argument as well as in the question on the elasticity of human behavior.<p>You could have assumed (correctly, if you had paid attention to what I&#x27;m saying), that questions like &quot;but what would you say in a world with spherical cows&quot; are of no interest to me, because the answers are obvious. If you construct an imaginary world where your conclusion is the only reasonable one, any reasonable person would reach that same conclusion. The only purpose of such questions is to test if the other side is indeed as stupid as you imagine them to be. As I am not, I see no reason in playing that game (again -- just assume that I would say the same as you) and writing the obvious answer -- it&#x27;s boring. I believe that problems arise when cows aren&#x27;t spherical, so questions about obvious-world are both obvious, and are nothing more than taunts.<p>What really happened wasn&#x27;t that my behavior matched your theory -- it most certainly didn&#x27;t -- but that you&#x27;ve chosen to imagine that it does by trying hard to not understand what I was saying. I can also surmise as to the mechanism, which I have detailed before: when someone disagrees with you on such matters you assume that they are not as smart as you, and then create an image of that reality in your mind by misinterpreting their words to match the interpretation that would be the intention of your imagined idiot.<p><i>My</i> theory was that you always choose to interpret the other side&#x27;s words in a way that would twist them to match the presumed claims of an idiot, and as a result you never actually give counter-arguments but pose teases (which you call &quot;core questions&quot;) that do nothing to move the discussion forward (I even know how you&#x27;d respond to this). My theory was yet again proven correct, and I think that much more convincingly than yours.<p>And, BTW, if by &quot;faith-based&quot; you mean based on values, then yours are, too. The difference between us is that you fail to see that.<p>In fact, that might explain a lot. If you believe that your conclusions are based on pure reasoning and nothing else, then if anyone does not reach the same conclusions, their reasoning  must be faulty (or they assign different probabilities than yours, but that is still perfectly in your comfort zone). You have no choice but to assume that the other side is stupid, because if they are not, then that means that your own conclusions arise from values, too.<p>While I can&#x27;t convince you right now that that belief is wrong[1], I would suggest -- as an eye-opening exercise -- to comb your reasoning for hidden assumptions that could reasonably be false. If you can&#x27;t find any, then either you are the greatest philosopher who ever lived or have a blindness to your own thought-process.<p>[1]: There are two problems here: 1. Is it possible to reach ethical conclusions from probabilities and reasoning alone? and 2. Is that what you&#x27;re actually doing? I&#x27;m not sure I know the answer to 1, although I believe it to be false (I can answer the claims made by ethical naturalists, and believe that they don&#x27;t really tackle this exact question), but so far I am very convinced that the answer to 2 is no.",1450727154

Very smart people have spent decades looking at alternatives and yet here we are.<p>> That&#x27;s quite a simplification -- without the podcast they wouldn&#x27;t sell books, swag, tickets, or receive donations.<p>Ok, let&#x27;s reframe it then. It&#x27;s a business that sells books, swag and tickets. And the podcast is a marketing cost center. Same outcome, they&#x27;re a company that sells stuff for money. And sometimes people donate.<p>> Websites that serve ads are not free.<p>They are. The monetary sense is what we&#x27;re talking about here. Not sure of this other &quot;cost&quot; your describing.<p>> Ad supported websites are not open, as every part of the ad network except for the literal content served to the client is closed and a trade secret.<p>What? By open I mean that websites are equally available to anyone regardless of logged in users or anonymous. This isn&#x27;t a closed platform like Facebook where you have to be logged in to use it, thus revealing your identity.<p>> Ad supported websites are not democratic because advertisers will not want to have their brand associated with &#x27;unsavory&#x27; topics or opinions which means that the overall content on the web is curated by small group ad networks that effectively &#x27;bless&#x27; content on the web by providing them ad revenue.<p>That&#x27;s not how it works. There&#x27;s a tremendous amount of advertising material to fit virtually any vertical or environment. Sites are democratic because it&#x27;s the audience that gives them value. Give the readers what they want and you get more readers and thus a more valuable audience to monetize. The site doesnt get to just make up whatever content it wants, it only works if there is a readership for it.<p><pre><code>  > The accessibility of ad sponsored content is just an accidental byproduct of paying customers visiting the site. If ad networks had the tools to discriminate between people who had high disposable income then the web would no longer be accessible to the poor as it would make business sense to simply not serve them the page.\n</code></pre>\nAgain, this is not how it works. &quot;poor&quot; people are not indigent (and those people are most likely not online that much). They still buy plenty and there are products for every price point. Most ads are sold on an impression/awareness basis so there&#x27;s always value in showing the message to more people. And ad networks already have access to data like household income. Most ad campaigns use both the context of the site as well as various data points of the user to target ads - this is why you see Rolex ads on the WSJ but not on your local news site. Either way ads monetize all users which in turn let&#x27;s the publisher keep the site open to everyone, as in it&#x27;s accessible to everyone regardless of who you are or where you&#x27;re from. That&#x27;s a good thing (whether it&#x27;s a byproduct or not).",1450726547

A balance is not necessary to gain credit history[0], though a very minimal balance is better than nothing[3].  What matters is utilization rate, which is the ratio of how much credit is used versus how much is available.  There is some misunderstanding about &quot;paying it off each month&quot; due to the fact that the CC companies report how much was used during a month not the balance at the end of the month.  (ex: with a limit of $1000, $900 was charged then paid off.  The $900 is reported, even though it&#x27;s paid off by the end of the month).<p><i>You would be far better off to get 2-3 cards, ring up some debt on each of them, and then make the monthly minimum payment, on-time, for 6-12 months.</i><p>This is some pretty poor financial advice.  Paying minimum balances is almost always a bad idea from a financial perspective.  The same effect could be had by obtaining one card, using about 5-20% of the available balance each month, then paying it off each month.

So back in 2011 I deleted the facebook account and got a dumb phone. As facebook was just taking off when I finished high school, I had never really lived my adult life without it. Just trying to give you some background to frame the rest of my response, I never started using facebook again. Nothing against the company, I know many people with use cases where having an account is valuable, and I have often thought of going back. Just hasn&#x27;t been worth it to me yet.<p>Introducing some challenge is a good way to figure out what is really important to you. If you are willing to charge through obstacles to have something, then it probably does actually off value to your life (barring addiction, etc). Then later, take the obstacles out of the way of the good, and stop doing the bad.<p>Learning there actually are a bunch of people living without smartphones (or leaving them in their pockets) was interesting to see. I didn&#x27;t really notice there were as many people connecting with each other when I was looking at my screen. Breaking completely from smartphone use for an extended period was necessary for me to start experiencing the value of looking around instead of taking every moment of free time to find some &quot;interesting&quot; new piece of information. However, having the dumb phone was really annoying when it came to texting (T9!), managing contacts, saving messages, viewing voicemail, and obviously no apps. There is a reason basically anyone who has the means wants a smartphone. From my experience, the only benefit of a dumb phone is more time to do what is important to you.<p>I live in the bay area and work in tech, so it is definitely possible. Now I have a smartphone again, but like other posters, I barely have any apps compared to standard user, and turn almost all notifications off. At the time, I got a &quot;feature&quot; phone for $20 and a $6 per month no contract plan. It is a very cheap experiment to run if you want to try!

If I do some sort of negative thing to you before you do/don&#x27;t commit an act I don&#x27;t/do want you to make, then I&#x27;m forcing you; &quot;ex: I&#x27;ll stop hurting you when you do this!&quot; If I do some sort of negative thing to you after you do/don&#x27;t commit an act I don&#x27;t/do want you to make, then I&#x27;m punishing you; &quot;ex: You did this and now I&#x27;ll hurt you!&quot; There&#x27;s a difference between those two things, but I agree the line dividing them is very fine.<p>I hope I got those do/don&#x27;t and don&#x27;t/do parts right and it&#x27;s understandable.<p>So, for the kid refusing to pray in school.

I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with that but I can understand the thinking.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t agree with it is because if I rob a bank and get caught, I go to jail. I&#x27;ve been punished. I know that if I rob another bank I&#x27;ll likely go to jail again, therefore with that logic I&#x27;m somehow being forced to not rob another bank if I choose to not do so.

I&#x27;m one of the authors of reference [38], Streamflow (<a href=""http://www.scott-a-s.com/projects/#streamflow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scott-a-s.com/projects/#streamflow</a>). Unlike the other allocators, our code has not been kept updated over the years. So it&#x27;s very reasonable our allocator is not compared against in the experiments. In any event, the allocator for TBBmalloc shares a lot of design similarity. (It&#x27;s based on McRT-malloc, which was presented as a paper during the same session as our allocator at ISMM 2006.)<p>The author of this paper does not use lock-free techniques, which our allocator used - I&#x27;m curious if using lock-free algorithms would have changed the author&#x27;s design, or improved the performance. I do think that despite the similarities that Streamflow has to TBBmalloc, Streamflow is not susceptible to the same kind of memory blowup. The problem, as described in the recent paper:<p>&quot;TBBmalloc can have an unbounded footprint. One case\nwas documented by [40]. In this case, one thread allocates\na large number of objects, and a second thread then frees\nthem, placing them into the first threads foreign block. If the\nfirst thread then does not call free(), then the memory will\nnever be removed from the foreign block to be reused. There\nappears to be no easy fix to this problem in TBBmalloc,\nsince the thread-local locking policy assumes, deep in its\ndesign, that every thread calls free() periodically.&quot;<p>Streamflow avoids this problem by putting the remote-free block check on the malloc path. That is, when allocating memory, you always check if other threads remotely freed memory for you. Basically, if you&#x27;re continually allocating memory, you&#x27;re also continually checking to see if you should clean your memory that other threads freed for you. You can see this in action: <a href=""https://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/streamflow.c#L1211"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scotts/streamflow/blob/master/streamflow....</a><p>All of the above is just to add some background - I look forward to really digging into this paper over the holidays.<p>(In case anyone actually follows my comments, they may know I currently do research and development for IBM Streams. That has zero relationship to this memory allocator I worked on early in grad school; it&#x27;s just an odd coincidence of project names.)",1450725563

10772815,comment,10768089,10768089,0,0,ideonexus,,,"I found this article very frustrating. Everything the author is complaining about comes down to one issue: the ratio of Teachers to Students. And yet, she does not mention this once.<p>> A major evaluation of Tennessee’s publicly funded preschool system, published in September, found that although children who had attended preschool initially exhibited more “school readiness” skills when they entered kindergarten than did their non-preschool-attending peers, by the time they were in first grade their attitudes toward school were deteriorating... overreliance on direct instruction and repetitive, poorly structured pedagogy were likely culprits; children who’d been subjected to the same insipid tasks year after year after year were understandably losing their enthusiasm for learning.<p>The problem here isn&#x27;t that preschoolers were more &quot;school ready,&quot; the problem is that the school system isn&#x27;t prepared to handle &quot;school ready&quot; students. School ready kindergartners have just come from a preschool like that of my sons, where state regulations require a 1:10 teacher to student ratio [1], and they are now in a 1:20 or worse ratio public school [2]. When a teacher is going over material some students have already mastered, those students zone out.<p>> Unfortunately, much of the conversation in today’s preschool classrooms is one-directional and simplistic, as teachers steer students through a highly structured schedule, herding them from one activity to another and signaling approval with a quick “good job!”<p>The author claims that providing a conversational class room is &quot;relatively cheap to provide.&quot; But this isn&#x27;t something a teacher can just change their teaching strategy and accomplish. This kind of interaction requires focusing attention on a student at the expense of the other students--so it takes more teachers. It is laughably naive to claim a teacher can have personalized dialogue with 20 kindergartners at once.<p>> Pedagogy and curricula have changed too, most recently in response to the Common Core State Standards Initiative’s kindergarten guidelines... One study, titled “Is Kindergarten the New First Grade?,” compared kindergarten teachers’ attitudes nationwide in 1998 and 2010 and found that the percentage of teachers expecting children to know how to read by the end of the year had risen from 30 to 80 percent.<p>And yet, the Common Core only requires children know a number of sight-words, basic phonetics, and the concepts of reading (words are separated by spaces, we read left-to-right, etc.) [3]. The standards, which everyone loves to criticize but no one seems to know what they actually say, are quite easy to meet. One of my preschoolers has easily mastered the Kindergartner recommendations with nothing but teaching him that the alphabet, words, reading, and books are fun--but it takes personalized time to encourage that attitude.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/hcsd/documents/ChildCare/STARS/Kits/3to4centerteachertochildratiochart.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/hcsd/documents/ChildCare/STAR...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbquestRT?rep=Kq1411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/mbquestRT?rep=Kq1411</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RF/K/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RF/K/</a>",1450725350

I spent so much of my youth wondering what was so innately wrong with me that my peers would take every opportunity to mock my speech, my hobbies, my mannerisms, my preferences in food, clothes, etc. I became severely depressed during high school and nearly killed myself. I felt incredibly broken, confused, and separated from my peers in every way.<p>My parents weren&#x27;t the type to believe in stuff like ADHD or Autism spectrum stuff, so the fact that I was getting great grades/test scores/had a few close nerd friends seemed to indicate I was just bookish and shy.

10772758,comment,10768532,10768532,0,0,usmeteora,,,"More in response to the comments so far than the article itself. In general, I think these comments too much reflect or defend against the idea that &quot;autistic women have it worse than autistic men&quot; and people are debating this when really the message is &quot;The scientific community does not have an official lsit of symptoms for autistic women versus autistic men&quot; This is important because noone knows what causes autism so diagnosis based on symptoms is the only way, and we are figuring out right now just how different these symptoms are, and how uneducated the medical community is at even thinking to get a girl diagnosed for autism.<p>40 years ago the medical community, even the guy who coined autism himself, didn&#x27;t even beleive it was possible for women to have autism at all (even the most extreme obvious cases) we are in close to that same position for high functioning women with Asbergers. Just take the fact that the average age of diagnosis for women is about ten years later in life than males, mostly because the symptoms accumulated over the past 40 years were only accumulated based on men. So women, just to get diagnosed (forget crying a life of &quot;oh we have it so much harder as being autistic) just to get a diagnosis you have to stumble into a series of misdiagnosis and oddities and lack of documentation about how these symptoms (again we don&#x27;t know the source) present themselves in women. BY then, women are just as much as men, if not more by a delayed diagnosis frustrated by everything theve been through and all the things that are &quot;wrong&quot; with them that their families can&#x27;t figure out.<p>The struggles autistic men and women face are not to be argued whether its worse for one gender or the other, but based on the whole point above, that they are DIFFERENT, and we are less educated about one set of symptoms than the other. It&#x27;s not about giving one gender a &quot;I&#x27;ve got it harder than you&quot; sympathy card.<p>1. In 2013 Asbergers was classified as being on the Autism scale.<p>2. Alot of high functioning Asbergers are technically autistic now that were medically/officially not autistic 5 years ago, but these people are no different than they were 5 years ago, its that the medical community rearranged a big group of typically high functioning people and put them on the autism scale. I happen to be one of these, and was diagnosed (as Maya was in this article) with OCD at 8, and anxiety, and basically an accumulation of common symptoms of autism until I went to an Engineering school where so many people were on the scale a Professor made us all take the test and that is when I found out about all of this.<p>3. Speaking of that, You can be tested for this and registered on a scale. As we do not know what causes autism, we can only diagnosis based on symptoms, like a lot of things, so the conjecture about &quot;not knowing for sure&quot; on this thread is valid, but so is it for alot of other diseases and cancers that we don&#x27;t know the cause of, so that does not invalidate the seriousness of the impact the non sourced symptoms have on the lives of people.<p>4. Being an Aspie and a book nerd (my mom first took me to get me tested to see what was &quot;wrong&quot; with me when I spent the entire summer of my 8th year and read all 138 Mandy (kids mystery novel) books in 7 weeks and didn&#x27;t care to do anything else).<p>I have since being diagnosed, read 17 books on females with Asbgergers and about 15-20 books about Autism in general, and I think the comments about females with Autism on this Atlantic comment thread and the HN thread so far are way off. That being said...<p>5. I DO NOT like this article because it is almost entirely anecdotal and focuses on Maya&#x27;s extreme cases while for me, and alot of other female aspies I know (sources of female aspies below) it went more like all the things that make you cute and &quot;quiet&quot; growing up, you do not grow out of.<p>I would pausit (and youll see some horribly negative and ignorant comments on the actual commentary of the article&#x27;s page on the Atlantic) that alot of the anger coming from the responses is trying to put girls on this special &quot;i have it worse than you&quot; stage but its not about that. It&#x27;s that we have it hard in DIFFERENT Ways.<p>Girls are EXPECTED to be socially smooth, incredibly bubbly and cute and outgoing. Girls to have careers that are more socially oriented. We are expected to be flirtacious. We are expected to be stylish. Any deviation from this norm results in a horror movie of emotional bullying especially from NT girls starting in middle school, who feel threatened by you and think you are some kind of monster, and the bullying does continue, just in more nuanced pretensed ways as women &quot;mature&quot; and learn how to be &quot;fake&quot; nice, whereas typically we are considered to be continually naive and childish, and too innocent because we are bad at interpreting other peoples emotions, and more importantly, their motivations, which actually makes female aspies more vulnerable to being taken advantage of in any situation, but particularly sexual ones, and this aspect is only exxagerated by the fact that overall physically and emotionally aspie women tend to mature more slowly, and most don&#x27;t start their periods until 19-20ish.<p>I would say from there it&#x27;s not that our genetic inheritance or whatever the cause is, that our physical lot of autism is &quot;worse&quot; its that our personalities, career choices and lack of friends when women are expected to have friends where its generally accepted that alot of guys are introverts, is that we are just put in situations where we stand out like a sore thumb more and more, whether it be being the only girl of 5 in my Engineering Department and automatically standing out, in the male dominated career or the fact that when a guy tries to hit on me at a bar I may look normal but the nuances of these more subtle interactions I fail miserably at.<p>I&#x27;ve lost a couple guys interested in me because I literally could not flirt and do this properly.<p>It means for me I have NO idea how to flirt, how to make any eye contact or in an effort to make any eeye contact giving an acidental death glare.<p>To say it&#x27;s degrading for your self esteem is an understatement...<p>Being socially awkward,<p>5.5 So as far as the people on here making comments and posting articles about how the more they see high functioning women/successful CEOs being autistic the less they believe it, BELIEVE IT! Because on the high functioning scale, we are masterminds and extremely laser focused and dedicated, but also sympathize with them how hard it is emotionally as well because it goes against the grain of everything people expect from women. Not to mention, women whove managed to surpass all these social abnormalities and become successful have learned more than ANYONE just how much success is based on political favour and shmoozing people, not because they are good at it or even succumbbed to it, because they KNOW how hard it has been not having those characteristics come naturally have had to put in the effort in one way or another to overcome inadequacies other people cannot even comprehend, and have probably faced alot of judgment as they have stumbled their way along. Certainly for me this is the case.<p>6. reddit.com/r/aspergirls is a more realistic perspective of what high functioning &quot;autism&quot; specifically Asbergers is likem since it is a community of women who have asbergers or are atlast trying to learn more about it by sharing about their symptoms etc.",1450724740

I&#x27;d point to Gulp and Rails&#x27; latest as a sign that there&#x27;s more work to do here. Even strictly in the Django world, there are a zillion asset-pipeline-like-apps; django-compressor and django-pipeline, the two most used, are quite different in their approach and philosophy.<p>I&#x27;m excited by this proliferation of tools for generating static web content &quot;offline&quot; and expect to see far more in the future. Lektor looks like another interesting piece to the puzzle, particularly in its focus on end-users rather than programmers. (Anyone remember Movable Type? That&#x27;s probably the first user-centric static site generator to gain widespread use?)",1450724466

It wouldn&#x27;t really cost them that much to maintain a database of subscription based services and do a text match to highlight them. Heck it can even be a category. You can of course do this manually, but they could automate it just as easily.",1450724439

It continues to be a source of frustration.<p>Looking back on my comment I was more harsh than I intended and a lot of that is because I am so frustrated with the current standard working environment.

8697311,comment,8695795,8695795,0,0,larssorenson,,,"I&#x27;m rather frustrated with this huge push to create a &quot;new&quot; CS degree, which is basically saying &quot;Let&#x27;s abandon half of CS and focus on just programming.&quot; Computer Science is, obviously enough, the science of Computers and computation. Coincidentally, programming happens to be a tool for computer scientists to interact with computers and demonstrate computational theory. While I understand and appreciate the necessity for good programmers/developers, people seem to miss the point of what a Computer Scientist actually is. It includes a whole lot of theory and knowledge of how computers function and operate, from the fundamental logic up to the application layer. Programming is learned as a Computer Scientist not necessarily for the purpose of a career, but rather as a means of implementing and testing theories and ideas. Much the same as Mathematics where theories are abundant, many of which are necessary to become a mathematician. You don&#x27;t see anyone trying to create a Math degree that skips a lot of theory and just teaches you Applied Mathematics for a career. While the analogy breaks down when you move into industry, the concept is the same. If you are pursuing a Computer Science degree, you must become a Computer Scientist. If you want a more objective approach, see the definition of Computer Science as put forth by wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science</a> . You&#x27;ll notice that Software Engineering is but a subset of the field of Applied Computer Science, which is itself a subset of Computer Science.
Before I continue ranting I&#x27;ll just summarize: You cannot forgo or  severely reduce the extensive amount of theory behind Computer Science and churn out Computer Scientists. It does not match up. If your goal is instead to produce more software engineers / programmers / developers who are not real Computer Scientists, then you should re-name your degree and your program. You might find CIT/CNIT/IT more appropriate. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology</a>",1417654586

8697265,comment,8696975,8697191,0,0,austinz,,,"Macros (the general Lisp concept) are really interesting. I&#x27;m still trying to grok them myself, so if I made any mistakes please downvote and correct away.<p>A normal Lisp function call might look like this:<p>(myfunc <i>arg1</i> <i>arg2</i> <i>arg3</i>)<p>where <i>arg1</i>, etc can be literals, variables, expressions. Like in most programming languages, each of the arguments is evaluated and then the function is called with the evaluated values of those arguments. When it&#x27;s done, a value is returned.<p>A macro is a lot like a function call:<p>(mymacro <i>arg1</i> <i>arg2</i> <i>arg3</i>)<p>However, it works differently. First of all, the arguments are passed straight into the macro - if <i>arg1</i> is something like (+ 1 2), the macro will see (+ 1 2), not 3 (as the function would).<p>Secondly, the macro is intended to return a list, which can be a function call or another macro call. (The macro could also return a final value.) The list can then be evaluated to either expand another macro, or to call a function to produce a final value. So you can think of a macro as a special sort of function that, rather than taking in <i>values</i> to produce another <i>value</i>, takes in <i>literal code</i> to produce <i>transformed code</i> (which then can be evaluated to produce a final value).<p>Now, one of the uses of macros that people cite is, for example, implementing your own control flow structures. Why are the two related? Lisps have something which are known as <i>special forms</i>, which look like function calls but don&#x27;t have their arguments evaluated before being passed in (like how macros work). The reason that matters can be described by a simple example: let&#x27;s say you wanted to implement a very simple version of &#x27;and&#x27; as a function (Clojure syntax):<p>(defn my-and [left-expr right-expr] (if (not left-expr) false (if (not right-expr) false) true))<p>However, the problem is that left-expr and right-expr will both be evaluated before my-and can even begin executing, along with the attendant side effects, etc. The problem is that functions can&#x27;t choose whether or not their arguments should or shouldn&#x27;t be evaluated - they just get the values of their arguments after they&#x27;ve been evaluated[1]. It&#x27;s not really possible to implement the traditional short-circuiting &#x27;and&#x27; using functions, or many control flow structures where you do not want to evaluate every possible branch unconditionally.<p>However, macros receive the literal code comprising their arguments, and they can choose to evaluate one, none, some, or all of their arguments depending on their internal logic. This makes them better suited for implementing behavior that resembles those of the Lisp special forms.<p>[1] This is the difference between call-by-name and call-by-value semantics. Most languages are call-by-value, as described above, but (e.g.) Scala has &#x27;=>&#x27; and Swift has &#x27;@autoclosure&#x27; to allow for some sort of call-by-name support.",1417653905

When it comes to content sought by the user, it&#x27;s hard to say that the user is giving the <i>service provider</i> real estate and attention.

It is driven by donations.<p>HN also appears legitimately free to me. As far as I know YCombinator does not mine or sell your data or collect data other that what is required for the forum to be a forum. YCombinator makes its money by other means.

First, their argument is essentially &#x27;What you expect this to be free? You are entitled!&#x27; Second, I&#x27;m not sure that replacing the term will work, unless it also communicates charity.<p>The point here is that the exchange does not constitute charity. Google thinks the trade is a very good deal. Presumably internet surfers do too.

8697252,comment,8689231,8689231,0,0,rplst8,,,"There are a couple of things that I would like to point out about digital sampling.<p>Early on in digital audio, anti-aliasing filters were awful.  The ADCs weren&#x27;t very good either, but the AA filters were bad.  Using a higher sampling frequency was one method to help this problem by providing more padding in the frequency domain so that a more gradual AA filter could be used.<p>Later, this was completely OBE with the advent of oversampling.  Most ADCs in use now are oversampling delta-sigma converters operating a very high sampling rates that perform decimation on the output to provide a 16 or 24 bit waveform at the normal 44.1kHz or 48kHz sampling rate.  Delta-sigma converters, and high sampling frequencies are actually the basis for Sony&#x27;s direct stream digital (AKA Super Audio CD).<p>Today, you can be reasonably assured that an ADC will provide a very clean, low noise, noise output in the vast majority of cases.  For music playback, this never mattered anyway.  Whether or not the transport of digital audio is at 44.1 kHz or 1 MHz, the quality to the human ear will be the same as long as it was sampled correctly and accurately.<p>That said - sampling at 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, or even oversampling, may not capture all that sound has to offer our ears.  One thing that can happen with music for instance is beating.  Beating occurs when two notes are sounded at slightly different frequencies (say 20,000 Hz and 20,100 Hz) there will be an audible beat at their difference.  Where this can come into play is in close mic recordings.  If I record guitar A) with an overtone at 30,000 Hz and guitar B) with an overtone at 30,100 Hz, these two would have an audible 100 Hz beat.  However, if we filtered and sampled at 48,000 Hz or over-sampled then filtered, we would lose both overtones and the ability to hear that beating.<p>How important is that beating?  Good question - but with live music it&#x27;s not a problem and with close mic recordings it is.  For recording, there are reasons to use higher sampling rates for at least the mixdown process.  I still think it&#x27;s silly to have 192 kHz audio for listening to recordings at home.<p>Bit depth on the other hand is something I think we could use more of - especially with classical recordings.  Audio quantized to 16 bits only provides about 96 dB of SNR.  I would much prefer having 20 or 24 bit audio to fully encompass the actual range of human hearing that is closer to 120 dB.<p>The other thing that cannot go without mentioning, MP3s, AAC, and other lossy audio formats are pretty good - but they DO NOT compare to lossless audio.  Having Google, Apple, and Amazon all step up to 44.1 kHz 16-bit audio sourced from equal or greater source material would be huge improvement over MP3s and AAC.",1417653610

It&#x27;s worse than trying to work in the same room as my kids playing.<p>I can disagree reasonably, but what good does that actually do me? Do I talk to my manager about it? He agrees but has no control over the layout. The upper-level management? They don&#x27;t agree and don&#x27;t care. Find a new job that&#x27;s not open-plan?

If you do bring in $1 MM or more, you theoretically will have enough to live out the rest of your life in a 4/5-star hotel on a beach somewhere. You could travel for a while, or just hang out, or you could try to turn that cash into something much larger. Personally, I&#x27;ve done all three, with different levels of personal satisfaction from each.<p>Depending on your age (are you closer to your 20s than to your 60s?), most financial planners will advise putting roughly 50% into higher risk investments (startups, riskier stocks, Forex baskets), and 50% into more conventional assets (real estate, investment funds, etc), with higher allocations to lower risk as you grow older.<p>I would definitely try to invest a large part of your wealth into assets that pay regular, well defined returns. The most conventional of these are real estate and dividend producing stocks. In real estate, there&#x27;s small apartment complexes, rental houses, small office buildings, and other commercial properties. Generally, you can purchase these types of assets with a 10% down payment and will see a return of 7-9% over the long term. Generally, you should be able to secure a 30 year mortgage on a property with interest of roughly 3-4%. There are other types of conventional investments that also perform regularly, such as purchasing under-performing small businesses like small tool-and-die shops, or other small manufacturing concerns.<p>Much of it depends on your taste for risk. For instance, energy and commodity stocks, which can usually pay out good dividends are in freefall at the moment (due to the low price of oil). However that freefall won&#x27;t last -- a well-timed purchase or sale could mean a 20% gain in a relatively short span. Additionally, Forex baskets are showing extremely great growth at the moment, with the right split between currencies. If you start monitoring these markets, you&#x27;ll start to get a feel for when the peaks/valleys occur, and can invest accordingly. Generally, it is wise to spread out your higher risk investments into smaller baskets that can be easily changed/converted into other assets. Also, be wary of any investment managers who claim they can beat the market. They likely can&#x27;t, and if they did before, it was due to a combination of luck, timing, and being in the right place at the right time. I have yet to meet someone who can reliably outwit the market.<p>If you have a taste for riskier investments, and since you have an engineering background (and are a short plane flight away from most of South East Asia), you might consider joining a small investment fund (or VC firm) that focuses on technology in SEA. There continues to be huge growth all over SEA (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, etc). Many startups require very small investments ($50,000-$100,000), and you could theoretically invest in 5 or 10 at the same time, with the intention of later selling one at 15-20x and the others either returning less than the investment or roughly breaking even. Attend one of the regional tech conferences as an investor, and find some teams/products that you have confidence in and invest!<p>If you have an idea for a product or service in any business sector, I would highly suggest starting your own company and &quot;giving it a go.&quot; In my experience, these types of ventures tend to have far better returns than any other, so long as you are judicious with your spending, and keep your company small and lean enough until it is able to narrow down on the right product/market segment fit. Once you have found the right product, then you scale like mad.<p>Remember: there&#x27;s no reward without risk.",1417652017

It is simple and straightforward. If the framework wants to allow you to swap in different implementation classes, then it will define a singleton or static class with a clear API that then dispatches to the specific implementation class based on your global settings. Or, if you want to override the default implementation on the spot, you can just invoke the implementation class you want directly.<p>So in django, I just do:<p><pre><code>  from django.core.cache import cache
  cache.get(&#x27;my_key&#x27;)
</code></pre>
Voila! That&#x27;s all the code I need, and it works great. I can easily swap in memcached or a file cache or a local memory cache or whatever. It is straightforward and easy to debug. If I am wondering why the wrong implementation service is being used, I can usually step through with a debugger right at the point it is being called and figure out what is going on. If you I am writing tests, I either use different settings or monkey patch the static class in my setup and tear down functions.<p>In most java frameworks, your classes are supposed to either accept the service via a constructor, or have it injected into your class via Guice or Spring. This adds a whole new level of complication and verbosity, and means things break far away from when you are using them. I know people swear by dependency injection, but I really don&#x27;t get it, I have never found it to be a better pattern than the django pattern.",1417651671

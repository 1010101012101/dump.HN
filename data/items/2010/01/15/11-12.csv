I read it as explanation of the motivation pg has for his essays. And I like the goal of seeking  the ""most general useful truth"".<p>Now, I'm not pursuing this goal because I think most  philosophical questions should be restated as scientific questions. The problem of knowledge, epistemology, becomes mostly cognitive science. The problem of conduct, ethics, should be researched using simulated evolution models of game theory. And so on and so forth.",1263556213

They have better infrastructure than most third world country with cheap labor I can think of. I don't know much about eastern Europe and what it bring to the table besides cheap labor. But from my experience I can tell you India (or any south-east asian country) is not an alternative to the manufacturing goods produced in China.<p>There is some kind of international trade pact (no reference handy at the moment) that forces most western nations to divide imports of manufactured goods from third world countries. If this was not the case - I have little doubt that most western countries would have relied on China, even more than it already does. Perhaps exclusively.",1263555981

That's how most affiliate-spam accounts grow - they follow as many people as possible, wait a period of time, and then automatically unfollow everyone that doesn't follow them back.  The cycle repeats indefinitely.<p>Many of these Twitter automation tools are primarily interfaces for scammers.  If the tool was built with that in mind, then it carries a hefty price tag.  If the tool's creators were well-meaning but naive, then the scammers get a free ride.  I'd guess that Twitter saw the amount of 'internet marketing' done out of SocialToo and decided to reduce its utility a bit.",1263555547

And if someone unfollows you, it shows that they're not that interested in you.<p>I totally agree with reciprocating unfollows; I'll happily follow most (non-bot, non-spam) twitter people, because that's what makes Twitter interesting. But if they then unfollow me, clearly they're not interested in forming a communicative relationship.<p>Personally, I find it a little worrying that Twitter are dictating the use of their API: not in terms of number of requests (which they should be dictating), but what 'good practice' behaviour should be (which, perhaps, they shouldn't).<p>EDIT: I don't mean to sound so prescriptive; what I mean is that many people use it for conversations and communication; I understand some use it as 'RSS', and therefore - to these people - it doesn't matter if follows are reciprocated. But for those that want to use it to build relationships, auto-unfollowing makes sense.",1263554399

Which is why I'm the one who got to do the statistics for evaluating A/B testing, eliminated multiple performance problems others had come to accept, and gets tapped to tackle complex ""how do we figure this out"" problems from time to time.<p>And yes, I've had the fun of seeing co-workers who theoretically had the same job as me argue that math wasn't useful for programming, while I was sitting there with a list of examples of how I'd recently used my math background.  (But then I got promoted into a different job title and in those discussions those programmers were able to respond that of course I needed more math for reporting, but they didn't need it as web developers.  Never mind that I was the guy who got asked to help when the database had trouble scaling at peak traffic of several million pages/hour...)<p>Really this seems to me to be a variant of the blub paradox.  If you haven't learned to reflexively see the benefits of thinking in some new way, you won't recognize how thinking that way could help with the problems you are solving day in and day out.  Conversely if you have gained those mental skills, you recognize their utility in situations that other people wouldn't dream they are applicable for.",1263554342

1054680,comment,1054526,1054639,0,0,pavs,,,"Can you explain why only Apple, when overwhelmingly majority of american consumer goods are manufactured/assembled in China?<p>Just to take Apple's example (they also rely on other asian countries for certain parts, ie. Korea & Taiwan comes to my mind right now), if they were to not rely on China to assemble/manufacture their products Apple products would have been even more expensive.<p>Also your iphone being defective has nothing to do with the fact that they were manufactured in China. While China made goods tends to be of low quality. High end computer gadgets like apple/dell goes through a certain high standard of manufacturing than your typical Chinese stuff. Companies tends to have a more hands-on approach to maintaining a certain standard and quality, which is generally missing in other chinese made products.<p>The problem is not that apple / google / MSFT invests and does business in China. The problem is that our government have legitimized Chinese style of government (a unique variant of communism), regardless how much they criticize on the side. Our government does not confront Chinese government directly. Its already too late to do anything now - we are too connected with their economy. If they go down - we go down, if we go down - they go down too.<p>The government can't do anything or the companies can't do anything without shooting their own leg. The only way we could pressure Chinese government is to start some kind of mass movement where we refuse to buy products manufactured in China (or similar government with questionable human-right records).<p>Its easier said than done, but the change has to come from us.",1263553684

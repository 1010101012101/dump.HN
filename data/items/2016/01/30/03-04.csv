But governments are going to care deeply about a formalized smuggling organization that beats market prices by evading import duties and VAT.<p>If this gets any traction, expect all inbound luggage to be searched for anything wrapped in shipmates packaging; and for it to be seized and the individual carrying it to be fined.

At the moment Israel&#x27;s own forces are very immoral in how they treat the members of the NSA/GCHQ.  What I mean is that Israeli intelligence drugs these people, in a way that I consider highly illegal and highly immoral.  The NSA and GCHQ doesn&#x27;t do the same, they haven&#x27;t infiltrated Israeli intelligence the same way.<p>You can read Israel&#x27;s general approach in the most famous book on this subject.<p>Now, let&#x27;s talk about something very important.  Around here I&#x27;m the only one to express these principles so you can likely link this to my usual account.<p>--> What is the moral imperative for the existence of spy agencies?  Why should they exist?<p>They should exist for the simple reason that someone can literally be a bitcoin troll and literally pay a Russian general for a nuclear weapon in untraceable currency, and literally, as a trolololo action, set it off in New York.  This isn&#x27;t an exaggeration.  It&#x27;s within the realm of both bored online Internet troll&#x27;s capability, and also inclination and interests.<p>So we have a reason for these agencies to exist.<p>Now, let&#x27;s make an analogy.  In the Fiscal year 2015, how much do you think California, where Cal Tech and Silicon Valley is located, spent defending itself against spies from the state of Massachusetts, where MIT and Harvard are located, where Mark Zuckerberg went to school?  How much did the two states spend on espionage and counterespionage?<p>The very obvious answer is $0.  That is exactly the way it should be.  It would be sooooo totallly stupid for California to start hacking Massachusetts.  This is the kind of stuff the European Union was doing internally, waging internal war, until it was unified in the second half of the twentieth century.<p>It is totally obvious to any 9 year old with an open mind that that this is a better state of affairs.  Literally anyone who says otherwise is obviously pointing to a naked emperor and saying how cool his new clothes are.  Only people over 30 who have deeply indoctrinated stupid bigotted beliefs would ever say that it&#x27;s good for European countries to spend their budgets waging war on each other, or spying on each other.<p>It&#x27;s totally obvious to me that international espionage is exactly the same.<p>It&#x27;s obvious to me that the amount of budget that the NSA/GCHQ should be spending on spying on Israel is exactly the same as what the CIA&#x27;s budget should be for &quot;spying on&quot; the NSA: (these are both american departments, just different agencies) obviously $0.  They shouldn&#x27;t be spending a penny on spying on other agencies.  Agencies literally have better reasons for existing, which are real.<p>In summary I couldn&#x27;t disagree with you more that this is a great use for the NSA/GCHQ.<p>It&#x27;s a terrible, atrocious use.<p>The world&#x27;s spy agencies need to act in total unison to keep honest citizens honest, without in any way impacting their freedoms unless and until they use those freedoms to blow up New York (or Tel Aviv) with a suitcase-sized tactical nuclear missile.<p>The only people the civilized world needs to wage war on are trolls, and if they stop existing, this money shoudl be spent on exploring space, fusion, telomeres, deep distributed learning, cancer therapy, quantum computing, and the list goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on.<p>No: the world&#x27;s agencies shouldn&#x27;t be spending a dime committing war on each other.  By the way a lot of HN&#x27;s readers can be part of the solution.<p>if you&#x27;re a reader, simply commit to a world government.  it&#x27;s the modern equivalent of a microkernel.  it doesn&#x27;t really matter what that government is - obviously it&#x27;s not going to let its states make war on each other. Just ask yourself &quot;Would a just world government microkernel do this?&quot; and if not, then resist, disobey, don&#x27;t do what you&#x27;re told.  Good luck.<p>This has been a very dense post and I&#x27;m happy to field follow-up questions on philosophy or application.  I can talk in some length about the status quo and my objections to it, my experience extends to several countries&#x27; programs.",1454123439

With a little bit of work, signature algorithms as expressed in standards like CMS could be abstract across the encoded representations.<p>But They Didn&#x27;t Do That.<p>Flash forward almost 30 years into the future, and we&#x27;re literally dealing with the same problems:<p><a href=""https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/94/cose.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/94/cose.html</a><p>&quot;The resulting formats will not be cryptographically convertible from or to JOSE formats.&quot;<p>WHAT REALLY?

Check the last page of the paper:<p><a href=""http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41892.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41892.html</a><p>CWT (and vicariously JWT) try to slap JSON/JOSE syntax/standards onto a bunch of existing concepts, but fail to actually fix the fundamental problems, like provable security. Yes, provable security: Macaroons are predicated on proofs. JWTs are predicated on broken promises and ad hoc design.<p>All that said, the authors of the JOSE/COSE standards couldn&#x27;t have tried harder to repeat <i>every single one of</i> the mistakes of the past. These standards are nonsense. Unless you&#x27;re switching from CMS they offer no practical benefits, and can potentially introduce new vulnerabilities due to their ludicrous complexity.<p>Unless you can name the exact CBOR-encoded standard you want to use and why you should use it, and the alternative you&#x27;re considering is practically anything but CMS, AVOID AVOID. Stick with anything that&#x27;s more standard. Slapping JSON on things doesn&#x27;t help, but just introduces new problems in a space where older standards are at least better understood.<p>There are problems in this space: ASN.1 is old, overcomplicated, hard to use, and the source of many vulnerabilities in the way it&#x27;s described. So we have a serialization format with bad semantics used in security critical contexts. Should we replace it? Yes? Is JOSE/COSE the solution?<p>JSON has many odd/ambiguous semantics, a shitty type system,  and there is no direct mapping between ASN.1&#x27;s type system and JSON/JOSE&#x27;s, because it is intentionally restricted by design.<p>JOSE/COSE&#x27;s solution is to improve a security critical format by getting rid of types.<p>Wait what? Improving security by <i>getting rid of types</i>? Yes that&#x27;s exactly what JOSE/COSE are doing, and it&#x27;s the wrong direction IMO.<p>I would much prefer some sort of modern typed serialization format which has packed and unpacked representations.

You can then provide commercial invoices, cover any duty and taxes, have insurance to cover the goods from loss or damage during transport, and (bonus!) comply with the importation laws of the destination country.<p>I bet that would work out to be less than $25/item and you wouldn&#x27;t have to count on mules to do your legwork for you.<p>It might even work out well as a UPS/Fedex competitor, saving shipping costs by batching shipments together and allowing you to expand into other countries. Though I&#x27;d be very surprised if this isn&#x27;t already a solved shipping/logistics problem.

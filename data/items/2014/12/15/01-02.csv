And note that you&#x27;re &quot;burning&quot; 400MW of energy in the heat exchanger (transferring it to the helium) at some point you have to re-cool that helium back to liquid) if you outgas the helium you are a net loss because helium has a limited supply. Doing it with hydrogen doesn&#x27;t get nearly the thermal mass. So it is a really really cool engine, but it remains to be seen how practical it can be.<p>The second thing, consider the experience from the SR-71. To stay light and still be able to withstand the frictional heating of the air at mach 5 requires some pretty exotic materials. And matching thermal properties for materials at mach 5 vs sub mach. Covering the whole thing in thermal tiles adds weight which comes out of the payload.<p>To me, adding on the possibility that it could be some sort of Mach 5 super airliner, suggests that the practicalities of it as an SSTO platform are perhaps not nearly so compelling as once thought. Fortunately they were not talking about the multi-gigawatt ground lasers to boil hydrogen. That idea, while nominally physically possible, is impractical to imagine the rest of the world being &quot;ok&quot; with.",1418608793

Doing so is nearly always a terrible idea.<p>The article is being a little unclear when it says &quot;cannot use&quot;. You can use literally any variable name in R if you really want to. If the name you want is already a reserved word (e.g. &quot;for&quot;, &quot;else&quot;, &quot;function&quot;), or if it is not a syntactically valid token (e.g. &#x27;@!&quot;:%$>&quot;@;&#x27;), then you just have to enclose it in backquotes. So the following is valid R:<p><pre><code>    `for` <- 1:5\n    `function` <- 5:1\n    `TRUE` <- `for` / `function`\n    `@!&quot;:%$>&quot;@;` <- `TRUE`^2\n    print(`@!&quot;:%$>&quot;@;`)</code></pre>",1418608793

They&#x27;re pretty outdated and should not be brought back now, in 21st century.<p>> Have you ever had to write software that considers the real-world possibility of a bit flipping in memory?<p>I did, as well as designing hardware with such a possibility in mind. Before things like HOL and ACL2 became available it was a total hell to do so. Now it&#x27;s a piece of cake.<p>> So you have software engineers graduating from CS programs<p>And how recursion is responsible for idiotic HR policies? One should never hire graduate engineers for anything distantly mission-critical. Never.<p>> And so he used it, oblivious to the potential consequences.<p>This sort of people will screw up anyway, no matter what kind of tools they&#x27;re allowed to use. Recursion is far below pretty much everything else on a list of things that an ignorant epileptoid can screw up, starting with off-by-one and pointer arithmetics.<p>And, leaving the embedded software aside, stack overflow is by far the least common issue out there, dwarfed by things like null pointer dereferencing and the said off-by-one.<p>> And so my issue with recursion is one of theory vs. practice.<p>Practice is irrelevant. It will never give you a full coverage of all the things you can potentially  screw up, not even with hundreds of years of experience. Theory, on contrary, is perfectly capable of doing so.<p>> Frankly, I can&#x27;t remember any programming technique that has killed more people.<p>Magic constants. Perverted approach to parallelism (shared memory instead of message passing). Google for &quot;Therac-25&quot; for example.<p>> why would anyone willingly allow a programmer to use such a dangerous approach to solving a problem?<p>Where the other means of ensuring correctness are not available, the right coding standards are more or less ok (the said JPL coding guidelines for example).<p>> Those of use who came up through machine/assembly language and low level stuff like Forth learn this because, well, you have to.<p>Can you imagine someone without this kind of background allowed to meddle with a mission-critical embedded software? I&#x27;m not aware of such cases, and I spent quite a few years in predominantly embedded environment.<p>> if, and only if, there is no other way to accomplish the same task.<p>Bingo. In the total languages there is no other way to accomplish, well, anything. And only the total languages are safe enough for the mission-critical software and hardware. Turing-completeness is evil - this is what you should have been attacking, not the innocent recursion.<p>> Introducing recursion into a mission critical piece of software means introducing something that must forever be in the back of your mind as a potential source of catastrophic failure.<p>Human mind is a broken tool and should not be allowed to judge a quality of a software. Formal logic is much better in ensuring that the software behaves exactly as prescribed.",1418605717

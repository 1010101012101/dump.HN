Jamaica doesn't deserve its Press Freedom Index ranking to be better than Canada's because of gay rights. This is wrong. First of all, Canada is hardly a truly free country. I read that 40% of the cost of living is taken up in taxes. What strange definition of freedom is that? Canada also has hate speech laws which will no doubt be used in time to silence serious political dissent. I would predict the first test to be serious anti-feminist messages.<p>In the US, libertarians are branded as conservatives. I like how you paired conservatism with repression.

Every time I've thought about the idea of open borders since, the analogy of driving in traffic comes to mind. To wit, the idea of open borders seems as orthogonal to basic human nature as allowing someone to change lanes into the space in front of you. Even when it is possible that the other driver has to exit the expressway for some very real reason (mechanical troubles, physical illness), it seems difficult to overcome the reflex of NOPE. Of course the scale is different. Letting someone into traffic doesn't cost you very much, in the grand scheme of things. Outside of that one movie plot where you are one minute late and miss some opportunity that changes your life.<p>The US has been headed very much in the opposite direction for the last decade.

The frontends are in Go for concurrency, and ferry messages back and forth from the channels to the backend.<p>Let me tell you, that problem is <i>hard</i>. Go coped pretty well, but the final thing is a mess of global states, and it's pretty elegant for what the problem is. I was hoping to avoid having many moving parts, but it ended up needing a <i>lot</i> of shared state between all processes.<p>Some problems are just hard, and, no matter how well-designed the language is, they'll still be hard. Something I miss from the language after implementing that is the ability to, say, monitor one goroutine from another to see if it returns (so the former can return as well). I know it's possible with channels, but when one goroutine is blocked on network Recv(), there's not much of a chance to listen to channels.<p>Anyway, yes, parallelism in Go is great, but not everything is magically all rainbows and unicorns (that's Django). Some problems will be messy and dirty, and even more so when you use channels.",1367181504

5622651,comment,5622051,5622490,8,0,adventured,,,"Executive compensation seems so out of whack because it has kept up with inflation, while real wages haven't even come close. Why? Allow me to explain.<p>The S&P 500 now gets half of its profits and sales from the rest of the world. The boom in countries like Brazil, China, India etc has vastly expanded the rest of the world's share of the global economy relative to the US. CEO's are compensated for this performance, but labor is paid based on local / domestic factors, not the profit generated in foreign markets.<p>The CEO wage numbers in the US demonstrate how horribly the US economy has fallen behind when it comes to labor keeping up with global growth. You can easily test this by scaling the corporate sales backwards, eg to the 1960s, and adjusting CEO compensation for inflation.<p>Everybody likes to talk about worker to CEO pay ratios, but what they never want to talk about is the destruction at the root of the problem: the Fed destroying the US Dollar. CEO pay has kept up, worker pay has not, and the why is easy to understand: the US economy is being flushed down the toilet.<p>By tapping into global growth, multi-nationals have been able to keep up with the horrific dollar devaluation that has occurred since the 1960s. CEOs are compensated on that basis. Meanwhile labor directly suffers the full intensity of the dollar's destruction. It is thus that the American standard of living has plunged over 50 years. Minimum wage has fallen from $45k to $50k per year ($1.25/hour in 1964, inflation adjusted), down to $14k or so today.<p>Americans used to be able to more than get by on one income, while a spouse stayed home to raise a family of four. The savings rate was radically higher also.<p>Fundamentally it's the same reason why wealth can survive inflation, but wages cannot. One can easily be shifted to defensive assets, the other drowns.<p>Even running just 3% real inflation per year is massively destructive to the standard of living over the course of a single decade. You have to generate 34% wage increases just to tread water.",1367181422

I feel especially inadequate when some people talk about getting 2 - 3 calls or emails a day and I feel lucky to get 3 in a <i>month</i> if I don't have my resume posted on Dice.  That said, my own experiences with recruiters have also generally been negative.  Over 95%[1] of unsolicited emails I get are inappropriate for my skills and experience, sometimes wildly so.

5622573,comment,5621763,5622527,0,0,gnosis,,,"Intent, or (to use the legal term) <i>mens rea</i>, has everything to do with hate crimes.<p>To quote David Neiwert yet again:<p><pre><code>  Lawrence points to the distinction between bias crimes and their\n  underlying parallel crimes, which in effect create two tiers of\n  evidence for any kind of hate-crime prosecution to succeed. At both\n  tiers, the criminal's mens rea is an essential component. In the first\n  tier of a crime -- say, an assault -- the intent to commit the crime\n  still must be established; at the second tier, both the first-level\n  intent and the second-tier bias motivation must be proven. For a\n  bias-crime prosecution to succeed, it must establish both tiers of\n  mens rea.\n  \n  Thus someone who merely partakes of hate speech, with no intent to\n  intimidate, is guiltless of a hate crime, because the first tier of\n  motivation is absent, and thus no free-speech rights have been\n  infringed upon. But because menacing and intimidation, all of which in\n  fact take the form of words alone, are punishable crimes in every\n  state, anyone using hate speech to terrorize his neighbors has\n  partaken of a bias crime.\n  \n  Consider, for instance, the example of cross burning. A white\n  supremacist who burns a cross at a private rally is undoubtedly\n  voicing a kind of racial hate, but there has been no attempt to\n  intimidate or menace anyone, and no crime has been committed.\n  Likewise, someone who, say, dumped garbage on a black neighbor's lawn\n  would only be guilty of harassment or intimidation, not a bias crime\n  (unless, of course, evidence existed he had done so because of the\n  neighbor's race). But someone who burns a cross on his neighbor's lawn\n  has clearly committed a hate crime, because he has both the intent to\n  intimidate and racial bias as his motivation.\n  \n  In this sense, hate-crime laws avoid running afoul of the First\n  Amendment in the same fashion as any other of the myriad\n  sentence-enhancement laws, including anti-terrorism statutes, because\n  they all reflect the differences in mens rea among acts that are\n  already established crimes. More to the point, there are limits to\n  free-speech rights; threats and intimidation are already illegal, as\n  are incitement to riot, incitement to murder, and other kinds of\n  speech.\n  \n  And indeed the Supreme Court recently has moved in this direction in\n  upholding the constitutionality of hate-crime laws. The recent\n  cross-burning case, Virginia v. Black, produced a March 2003 ruling\n  (authored by Sandra Day O'Connor) that followed this logic closely.\n  The state of Virginia, the Court said, was well within its rights to\n  outlaw cross-burnings meant to intimidate:\n  \n     The protections the First Amendment affords speech and expressive\n     conduct are not absolute. This Court has long recognized that the\n     government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent\n     with the Constitution.  For example, the First Amendment permits a\n     State to ban ""true threats,""  which encompass those statements\n     where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an\n     intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular\n     individual or group of individuals.  The speaker need not actually\n     intend to carry out the threat. Rather, a prohibition on true\n     threats protects individuals from the fear of violence and the\n     disruption that fear engenders, as well as from the possibility\n     that the threatened violence will occur.  Intimidation in the\n     constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true\n     threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of\n     persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily\n     harm or death.</code></pre>",1367180160

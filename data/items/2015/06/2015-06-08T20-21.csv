I think it&#x27;s correct to say that we are not fully decentralized, which we were close to initially, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s entirely constructive to say we are moving in a direction that leads to a centralized internet, and what that implies (a single authority, even if for a single service).  I think we are moving towards, or have arrived at, what we see in many markets.  Large dominant players that the majority use, but with a large market of smaller players that provide for the niche needs.  Take the automotive industry, for example.<p>I think we are largely arguing over semantics, which is something I don&#x27;t want to do, but at the same time it&#x27;s hard to be sure I&#x27;m not just reducing your arguments to the point there&#x27;s no difference and ignoring important points at the same time.<p>> But none of that changes that centralization is happening.<p>I think it&#x27;s cyclical, and there will be periods where we move along the spectrum back and forth, but I doubt we&#x27;ll get as close to the decentralized end as we started at, but for many reasons.  I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get all that close to the decentralized end either though.<p>> Multiple distinct companies != peer-to-peer internet.<p>My argument has not been &quot;we are decentralized&quot;, it&#x27;s been &quot;we are not centralized&quot;.  To that effect, peer-to-peer is irrelevant to my argument, and I&#x27;ve tried to make that clear.<p>> Everybody running their own mailserver: could be a good thing, presuming they can be made easy to set up and easy to maintain (I don&#x27;t see any technical reason why not). Ditto webhosting, why should facebook host all your content (or google, or Yahoo).<p>Because it&#x27;s very, very inefficient.

In Objective-C you had synthesized properties to generate all the boilerplate code, but in Swift you don&#x27;t, so to copy certain Objective-C patterns you have to manually write your own private instance variable plus a computed property to control access and side effects. Stuff which is trivially hidden behind a macro. Come on, even Java allows use of annotations to generate code at compile time on Android.<p>Of course you can argue then that maybe Swift code should not use Objective-C patterns, but hey, I&#x27;m still porting and learning. And maybe Swift 2 by the end of the year will have this feature, just like the usage of the where keyword inside conditionals was added recently in 1.2.<p>I also dislike that there are no forward declarations, so instead of being able to put all your class public API in a single block you have to mingle it with setter/getters&#x27; implementations.

India doesn&#x27;t have a goal to be a global power, and its economy is much more closely integrated with the West, so it&#x27;s a very kind strategic ally in the changing global economic situation. Its growth and its rise is an area of balance for the West in a world where trade and economy are shifting away from the old world and into the Asia Pacific.<p>India, with regard to geostrategy, is uniquely placed for growth. Of course it has a large population, which is a huge help, but it also likely to benefit from the trillions of dollars of investment being made by China&#x27;s investment in Eurasian oil pipelines and trade routes (and Russia&#x27;s attempt to galvinize a Eurasian Union).<p>That is to say India will benefit both by West and by East investment.<p>Now, in support of this Modi (which is in large part the &#x27;West&#x27;s man&#x27;) has agreed to Westernize a very great deal and to grow India in very specific and strategic ways.<p>An example of this is China&#x27;s investment and experimentation with &quot;Smart Cities&quot; - cities that are designed so that every piece of socioeconomic data can be recorded and adjusted. The idea with a smart city is that this level of insight allows huge boons in the study of, governing of, and changes to the municipality.<p>With the West&#x27;s encouragement and investment (through multilateral investment groups) India has not only performed huge amounts of financial reorganization but also promises to build 100 smart cities of its own.<p>And interesting twist on this is that the smart cities invented by the West have an investment clause: the West wants to &#x27;own&#x27; the city - to have equity in it - so that the cities are privately owned and that when people pay to live in the cities and as the cities produce surplus this money goes back into the pockets of private investors.<p>This is a kind of scary prospect for those who have traditional Western grounding as it makes these cities seem more like giant corporations (or maybe &#x27;fiefs&#x27;?) than democracies.<p>But this probably isn&#x27;t what the poster above is talking about?<p>Could you speak more about what trends you see in India?",1433795206

If you have access to an academic library, you will find plenty of others too.<p>The books mentioned above do not teach you how to program, but how to become a better programmer. They cover all layers of programming, from software design down to the writing of individual functions. Especially &quot;The Art of Unix Programming&quot; was brilliant, as it gives real-life case studies for every topic.<p>And lastly, download the sources for some good open-source programs and study them (ideally with the aim of contributing).

I don&#x27;t however think that humans are any better in this regard. Humans also tend to recommend near the center of a distribution of tastes, and when they stray from that, it&#x27;s out of a deliberate move to find something new/different. Algorithms can do the same (and many do), but many of those suffer from other problems - such as poor interfaces or limited catalogs as mentioned.<p>Just because no one has done it really well <i>yet</i>, that doesn&#x27;t mean we should all go back to human-curated playlists in my opinion.<p>Edit to add: Perhaps part of my reluctance to rely on DJ&#x27;s and human-curated playlists is a lack of trust. When a person recommends something to the masses, my gut instinct is to question motives (who is being promoted and why). When an algorithm recommends something to me as part of an unlimited service, I tend to feel like it&#x27;s been tailored to me for no reason other than to maximize my enjoyment (though admittedly, the truth is that algorithms may be built with just as much - if not more - questionable bias as any human).",1433793733

That&#x27;s why stuff like Spotify playlists (curated music) got hundreds of thousands of subscribers. And DJs haven&#x27;t died, they just took it outside radio, and into arenas, because modern radio has both annoying ads and marketing-oriented programming, something that this announcement is not meant to share.<p>If done right it could be big, and things can come and go in circles. Heck, there are millions of hipster kids out there buying vinyl, which wasn&#x27;t even in fashion when they were born.",1433793677

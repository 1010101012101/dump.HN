939581,comment,939437,939437,0,0,jsz0,,,"I don't see much logic behind capital punishment. Wouldn't someone who is irrational enough to take another humans life in a pre-meditated way not value their own much? Maybe after the fact they regret it and fear death but it's already too late. The risk of executing any innocent person is so incompatible with basic human rights that whatever joy the victims family gets out of a revenge killing simply isn't worth it. I'm also a bit terrified by the radical Christian fundamentalists that can somehow rationalize taking another humans life in this context. It's far too close to the mindset of a suicide bomber who can twist religion into being compatible with their own hatred and anger.",1258098736
939580,story,,,92,78,jquery,"Ask HN: how do you avoid burnout and getting taken advantage of?",,"I'm 3 years out of college. The first year my product made the CEO a million dollars while I made less than $50k in salary and 0.01% equity. Ugh. I moved to another company which paid double that, and worked like a dog (80 hours weeks) for nearly two years, and was one of the most productive engineers.  One of my products helped bring in over 6 million in VC investment money. After two years I asked for a raise, and didn't receive one, being told ""we can't give raises during layoffs.""<p>When I told them I was quitting, they offered me a giant (>25%) raise, but I couldn't stomach the thought of staying after accepting another offer, so I moved to another startup. I took my first project from $50 to $700+ daily revenue in 2 months by working 100 hours weeks. Yet because I take a modest salary, and have significant but non-founder equity (1-2%) to be vested over 4 years, I feel like I'm just making other people rich. I'm starting to become depressed. My sex life with my girlfriend has become non-existent. I dream about the rewards of hard work--I want to travel, to live the good life--but then I look at my life and see my twenties beginning to slip away, with a high likelihood of nothing but memories of hard work and my morning coffee to replace them. My company would have to be acquired for $10 million, at the very least, to make a very modest improvement to my lifestyle, and over $50 million to make any significant difference.<p>Am I being too impatient, or am I simply having my twenties milked by charismatic CEOs who know how to exploit eager young workers, and how can I even tell the difference? What is the best thing I can do, right now, to take control of my professional life? Is it okay to ask for more salary just two months into a position? I feel exhausted and exploited.",1258098614

The Digest is a weekly email update of the top tech and entrepreneurship events happening in the Valley and around the Bay area. Check out the latest digest (and our painfully simple website) at http://thestartupdigest.com. We have been brainstorming ideas to create more simple tools that would help startups succeed. Our latest one is for a ""Competitive Digest"" to offer alongside the events digest. I've included an outline of the Competitive Digest below. We would love to hear what you think!<p>Problem – Companies need to keep track of their competitors but don’t have the time to do it effectively. It is important to do so because investors/customers will expect you to know what your competitors are offering and it will help you with both generating feature ideas and competitive benchmarking.<p>Our Product - The Competitive Digest will provide you with a weekly update on what your competitors have been up to, how you stack up against them in key metrics, and how you might acquire insight on what they will do next.<p>How it Works - The Digest is separated into three sections: Headlines, You vs. Them, and Competitive Content. View an example here: http://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=92be899ef5a892c60b4a6cd97&id=9abcf51997&e=<p>The Headlines section features the most important things your competitors did last week (from articles, press releases, etc.)<p>The You vs. Them section provides you with competitive metrics to compare your website traffic, customer engagement, and media coverage.<p>The Competitive Content section provides you with links to both yours and your competitors’ tweets and company blogs. It also links you to any job postings they have and shows you any LinkedIn connections you have to their current and past employees.<p>We now have some questions for you about this problem, the product, and the offering in general. Thanks for all your input and feedback in advance. If we generate a good response we will be sure to reward you with a first demo trial of the product at a steep discount :-)<p>Is tracking your competitors a problem for your company? If so, who is this specifically a problem for?<p>Would you be willing to spend money to solve this problem?<p>How much time (if any) does this person spend per week keeping track of your competitors?<p>What do you think overall about the product offering, and what features should the Competitive Digest have from Day 1?<p>What is the hardest part of tracking your competitors, and if you could change anything about that process what would it be?<p>Do you have a budget for this problem, and who would be the person in your company in charge of this?<p>If this product cost $100 a month would you buy and use it?<p>If this product does not seem interesting to you, do you know anyone who would want something like this?<p>Thanks again,\nChris & Brendan",1258097687

Something like encrypted RSS linking private content for your 'friends' and public content for the rest of the people.<p>I think the popularity of social networking over the current definition of personal webpage is driven by three things, ease of use, the ability to define public/private content and cost.<p>There are plenty of niches in such a model, pure self owned/hosted (Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal etc with plugins), advertising supported we make it easy for you (Tripod, Geocities), free(Blogger, Livejournal), subscription (pay to ditch ads), and even old guys interconnecting with the new (a fancy Facebook Connect).<p>Benefits that I look forward to are my ability to control my interface and not have it change on <i>someone elses</i> whim, complete ownership of my personally generated content and an end to the serial monogamy of having to move to the new-new thing when the old-new thing inevitably dies.",1258097111

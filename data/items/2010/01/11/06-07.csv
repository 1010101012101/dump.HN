1044552,comment,1043893,1044429,0,0,tmsh,,,"But the argument hints that they are missing the big picture by, as you claim, 'mismanaged spending and [a] high taxation rate'. My point is that it's better to miss the big picture while helping people, than to miss the big picture while criticizing people.<p>Greenspun visits Berkeley for maybe 3 or 4 days and he's now quite sure that people there have it wrong? He mentions Prop 13 in passing, as something that everyone in the East Bay keeps on talking about. Some might argue it's a much bigger issue than he realizes. Far from over-taxation being a problem, it would be that California has not taxed based on real property values for decades. I.e., Greenspun has side-stepped a large problem in the bigger picture by being hyper-critical.<p>Perhaps I'm overreacting, but I was just getting a little tired of Greenspun's hints that there is a problem with being naive about 'doing good' -- as you mention (quite well said, that is sort of how I read Greenspun's attitude). My point was to hint that there is also a problem in taking one's 'cynical reflex' too seriously.<p>After all, these actions, at a certain level, are really kind of similar movements. Hyper-taxation and hyper-criticism both attempt to optimize at the wrong time, too impatiently. However, in the former case, at least someone gets helped (though arguably by being critical Greenspun is helping eventually). At any rate, I don't think what he says is completely incorrect. There's just a flip side to it. E.g., in any sufficiently large Lisp program, a lot of time is spent in FFI.",1263193183
1044551,comment,1043883,1043883,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"It's kind of ridiculous that Chomsky is #1.  You can't deny it was influential.  Chomsky singlehandedly split the linguistics field into two camps, and it's taken the better half of the century to put his ideas to rest.<p>He basically argued that all languages are governed by the same set of rules, that such rules were innate, and that languages could thus be parsed into trees.  The problem arises that a lot of primitive languages don't even seem to support the notion of recursion, let alone something that parses to a syntax tree.  And the statistical NLP folks have a major bone to pick with such ideas, because real language apparently isn't so clean.<p>What seems more plausible is that more advanced societies developed rules of logic that they then imposed on their communication, hence the property that well-written English ought to be pars-able to a syntax tree.  But even then you have ambiguities in how the tree is structured.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity</a><p>The flip side is that Chomsky's framework hasn't been useless to science.  You can do some interesting things if you can parse a piece of text's syntax tree with halfway decent accuracy.  One example would be idiom-finding.  If a word seems misplaced, or used out of its usual context (e.g. ""kicked the bucket""), then it is likely an idiom.  One could simply do an analysis using the frequencies of the words as they appear next to each other, but applying a filter on only those phrases that are likely to be idioms improves your results by quite a bit.",1263193175

1044549,comment,1044280,1044450,0,0,jawngee,,,"How do you get anything done?  You seem so hung up on the tools versus creating stuff with tools.  I guess it makes sense because you're the maintainer of a web framework ... for perl ... a language saddled with a checkered history of generating some pretty unmaintainable shit.  And my guess is that you will respond saying ""you can write maintainable code in perl!""  And, of course, one would counter that you can do the same with PHP.  Which boils this whole discussion down to being about the developers and the quality of developers, and less about the quality of the languages.<p>So why are there so many crappy PHP developers?  Because anyone can make it do something approximating what they are envisioning it doing, no matter the skill level.  That seems pretty powerful to me.  And, in the end, it's really about the results instead of how one necessarily got to those results.  You can't make money if you don't deliver a product.  And if history is any indication, only a tiny fraction of the masses care about quality.  The dominance of Wal-mart and MySpace are proof of this.  My guess about your guess is those millions of lost man-hours have been made up with the millions of hours beating competing products to market due to the rapid nature of PHP development.  I mean if we are throwing around unverifiable assumptions, let's do it, let's get crazy with it.<p>""A determined soul will do more with a rusty monkey wrench than a loafer will accomplish with all the tools in a machine shop."" - Robert Hughes",1263193089

Say you want an online store. An online store requires a shopping cart. You ask google how to do this, and google tells you: <i>How to build a shopping cart with PHP</i>. For whatever reason, php was chosen by the internet gods to be the beneficiary of a positive feedback loop: beginners use php, find it easy to use, write tutorials. Tutorials attract google, which means the community is likely to be less of the programmer type (programmers would already know how to do these things in python) and more of hobbyists/internet entreprenuers with little technical skill. Because this community is comprised of less technical people, they are more understanding of the shortcomings of n00bs. They turn away less ""stupid"" questions, write more tutorials and abstract more of the academic attributes of programming that ""make it work"". By virtue of attracting so many people, inevitably, there will be some truly capable practitioners that will go on to have success. Derek Sivers of CD Baby fame is one I can think of.<p>The point i'm really trying to drive home is that the accessibility of a language isn't just about being easy to learn, but about having a welcoming community and environment that helps new users.",1263192549

Heck, even today, think about someone trying to run a blog - anyone reasonably experienced with a computer can buy hosting and install WordPress with almost no work... try that with anything written in Python?<p>PHP has a very low barrier to entry, and IMHO a lot of the hate directed at it is frankly jealousy. We are jealous, as professionals, that it is deadly simple to replicate some of our hard work, and that the people doing it are amateurs. This is the same reason people heap hate on VB.<p>I'm inclined to compare PHP to MySpace - yes, MySpace pages aren't pretty, in fact a lot are downright atrocious. You can make some specious claims about how MySpace-inspired ""web design"" has made the internet a worse place, somehow, but it would be a pretty thin argument.

At first you use it to describe someone who worries about peak oil / the finite nature of oil (presuming you understood the original context of the discussion), and later you use it to describe an environmental conservationist - one who is concerned that the costs of resources are underpriced because of the effect on the environment - to which you've helpfully provided examples of strictly environmental externalities.<p>Markets aren't perfect problem-solving devices - no one has said that they are, however, the regulatory ""cure"" is often worse than the disease.  Regulations are certainly not the ideal way to deal with concerns a given resource are finite.  Further, prices are signals in markets that themselves call for market innovation/adaptation - vocal calls for conservation are redundant.<p>(As a side note: it is also noteworthy however that the drop in sulphur dioxide emissions happened far before the creation of regulated markets suggesting that the fall in SO2 might have occurred irrespective of the regulation - further, from purely an economic efficiency standpoint, pigouvian taxes tend to be more efficient than the added structure of artificial pollution markets.

1044501,comment,1043476,1044091,0,0,btilly,,,"Here is a good example.<p>Let me observe that both men and women don't just want to find someone of the opposite sex, they would like to be with someone who is as good as possible.  When you are with a person who is as good as is possible for you to land, that person will be someone you have difficulty getting to be interested in you like you're interested in them.<p>So, for instance, a man who dares say something moderately insulting to a woman early on establishes that he thinks that he could do better.  If he does not offend her too badly and turns around and gives her some hope, that gives her the message that he's someone she has a chance at but has to work for.  If she believes that message, she'll think of him as a good potential catch.<p>Going the other way, a woman who doesn't feel compelled to return a man's calls promptly, puts off sex, and who insists from the start on time for herself is demonstrating that she believes she is a reach for him.  If he believes her, then he is more likely to work to establish the relationship, including making the commitment to take care of her and help raise their children.  (Which is what marriage is.)  No man likes those games, but most of us respond to them.<p>These parallel pieces of advice are both effective and offensive.  You'll find the advice for men as part of the standard repertoire in virtually any guide for pickup artists.  It is standard because experience shows that it helps get women in bed.  Conversely the advice for women is straight from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rules-TM-Time-Tested-Secrets-Capturing/dp/0446518131/ref=pd_sim_b_3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Rules-TM-Time-Tested-Secrets-Capturing...</a>.  That is sort of a female counterpart to the pickup artists guide and is about how to land a man who will commit.  The polarization of the reviews is evidence of both offensiveness and the gratitude of women who found the advice effective.  (Read the reviews and you can verify the reasons for the votes.)<p>So there is a concrete example for you.  Landing someone of the opposite sex and getting them to do what we want them to do is of interest to the vast majority of us.  (Yes, some people are gay or asexual, but the vast majority are straight heterosexuals.)  Yet advice that is effective for that is quite offensive.<p>And, of course, when we're offended by advice about the sexes, we usually call it sexist.",1263191238

If I am never forced to pay for this, it's an uncaptured externality, meaning that effectively, I'm paying too little to emit Q.<p>There's no arbitrage opportunity, the only way to stop me from emitting Q is to find a way to capture the externality.  In the United States, this would probably occur either via a lawsuit that attempted to make things right, or I'd simply be stopped via regulation that prohibited the emission of Q at unsafe levels.<p>The general criticism against fossil fuels is that they have a similar, but harder to quantify issue.  Scientists generally agree that changing the atmosphere changes weather and hydrology in somewhat hard to predict ways.  This means that whenever you add carbon, you're really increasing the risk of expensive problems.  As a simple example, if you raise the ocean level by even a foot or three, there are huge amounts of infrastructure that are suddenly underwater, or that need expensive protection.<p>Or perhaps the additional carbon causes weather patterns to change in manner that leaves the Dongjiang basin dry.  Then a large area is useless for agriculture and industry, and the existing infrastructure is devalued.<p>But I can burn oil all day, and I don't actually pay for those damages.  They're uncaptured externalities.  My use of oil is cheaper than it really should be, because it doesn't reflect all the costs.<p>As such, there's nothing to arbitrage.<p>* How do you suppose these conservationists aim to correct these ""externalities""?*<p>Generally speaking, the goal is to come up with some sort of estimate on what costs are being incurred to others, and then apply that charge.<p>An example of a situation where this worked very well was with SO2 in the United States.  Sulphur Dioxide emissions were causing acid rain, which caused a number of harms to others.  As such, the government set a limit as to the total amount of SO2 that could be emitted, and created a market where companies could bid for the right to emit that SO2.<p>This encouraged companies to innovate, and find ways to reduce SO2 emissions.  It worked incredibly well, costing companies <i>far</i> less than anticipated, and essentially solved the SO2 emission problem in the US, reducing it to levels that don't cause meaningful damages.<p><i>That merely goes back to proving the point that the markets themselves create the incentives for resources allocation - ie innovate and adapt and for this reason it has been historically foolish to bet that we will run out of a given resource.</i><p>You're seeing what you want to see.  Markets are not perfect problem-solving devices.  The price of oil reflects only the costs to get it from the ground, and the demand to burn it right now.  It does not include the portion of the harm that may be accumulate from billions of people burning oil every day for decades.<p>----<p>edit: and you see how bad people are with understanding the financial impacts of long-range things all the time.  An easy example is to look at how poorly insulated many houses are, even in cold climates.  The homeowners could spend $1,000 on insulation and save $600/yr for the next 15 years, but they don't do so, because the true price isn't sufficiently transparent.",1263189962

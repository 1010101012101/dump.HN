We tried different options and in the end wrote our own comet solution using JBoss Netty. Working with JBoss Netty was really great, but we hit perfomance limits on lots of open connections (100.000+).<p>At that time node.js was released and I did some experiments with it and found it it had great perfomance and very low memory footprint. I also had an university course on the V8 VM (by the actual Google team :)) so I was pretty interested in V8 and node.js at that time. I experimented more with this and eventually we rewrote our comet solution to node.js<p>Fast forward today we are still running node.js and processing many millions notifications each day. I would recommend digging into node if you are interested in building a scaleable notification system.

I don't think that any security expert would claim that. It's sufficient if the relevant parts of the system and the communication protocols between your components provide a secure foundation. Writing <i>all</i> of your code in a verbose language would be total overkill and a huge waste of effort. So, in the end a combination of both systems might be the solution. The issue here is that this news post is about ""the language of the future"". It's definitely far from <i>the</i> language of the future. If at all, it might be a small component of the language(s) of the future (and even for that it should better improve on readability).

What is strange to me is that we are living in  2010 and yet here we are writing queries for a backend layer that should simply be a lot more easy and fast to do. Imagine for websites, you have to create a database with tables and fields and so on, then you have to write extra code in some perhaps to you foreign language where you select what data you wish to present based on some parameter.<p>Why oh god why!? I don't want to write queries, and it's not because I think it's hard or anything like that, the reason is more about time and funfactor. Writing queries to me is the most boring part of any project and often a very time consuming process, imagine spending this time designing or improving your app in other ways. So what could we have instead?<p>Well imagine a perfect world where all you would have todo is create some table/fields or documents depending if it's a relational or no sql db. Then you would simply through some amazingly easy and efficient interface select what data you want to present and it would automagically generate whatever code/query or a process that is necessary, then you would just invoke that process to obtain that data.<p>Nooo no no I am NOT talking about query builders, those are horrible! They take even longer time to work with than just writing plain simple query code, I am talking about a revolution in the way we deal with this layer - ""queries"" I call it a ""layer"" because to me it's like a layer of a development process that is necessary but should not be as time consuming or boring as it currently is. Sorry to all you query writing lovers out there!<p>There should be some tool or way to generate a function/stored procedure/x that outputs your data as arrays/objects/json/xml/whatever based on some simple dragging or dropping or marking that you would do with a super neat efficient interface. The tool would then do all the work for you, and whatever query/procedure/function that it generates would already be amazingly optimized, now you would just invoke it and bam there is your result set ready in some array or object for you to use as you want. Que rico, verdad?<p>Maybe I am living in the 90s still, maybe this already exists, and I have been living under a rock, perhaps I am asking for too much, who knows I am just letting the world know and I am sure there is a lot of people that can agree with me. Especially people more oriented at design or frontend stuff...<p>Gaah the frustration,

Hence we'll always have some trading action take place around the true price, in which speculators attempt to beat the market psychology. What we're doing is accelerating the speculation, shortening the timeframes for everything; this doesn't just increase liquidity, but also increases the average spread of prices over a given time period.

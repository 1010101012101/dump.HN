319457,comment,318595,318956,0,0,mnemonik,,,"Perhaps they were gambling that enough dems would vote for it (because of the scare tactics of reading out the dows stock starting to crash right before the vote) so that it would pass, and later when the bailout became the political failure it was destined to become they could point to dems as responsible. American voters have a very short memory, and few check facts. I'm sure that the fact that this is so closely connected to Bush could be forgotten with an excellent mudslinging campaign. Then the Repubs would be able to take seats in the next congressional round of elections.",1222768425

If the income from the sale nets more than the government spend to fix it, that profit is distributed to the original shareholders.<p>This happened i Sweden in the early 90's. Some banks were in trouble, and the government said that they'd help them, but by nationalization. One of the major banks were then suddently conveniently able to get some capital, and survived on it's own.",1222768311

Maybe it's just that we do a lot of international business and our products are on sale because of the USD deflation, I dunno.<p>But, I'm having a hard time seeing the storm from where I'm sitting.  I know it's coming, and I'm tucking away a little cash and being cautious about spending, but so far, we're doing better than ever.<p>Anybody actually feeling the pinch yet, or is it all just a ""something bad is coming"" feeling?",1222766508
319446,comment,319256,319256,0,0,newsit,,,"The problem with the nested sets is that changing the tree can be slow. You need to update all the nodes with right/left pairs after the insertion/deletion point.
There are two more methods which can be of interest and don't suffer from this problem:
""Materialized path model"" (which uses strings to encode the whole path to a node) and the ""nested intervals tree encoding"" (which could be the ideal solution if someone manages to implement it. I couldn't find a decent implementation):

I was actually pretty impressed by how things have changed and I think I'll be logging on more often.<p>As for the recent redesign, they had to do something to get everyone's profile organized, readable, and consistent again (while still giving people the ability to customize things and add apps) and they actually did a really fine job. It may be a little confusing and disorienting at first when you're expecting everything to be on a single page, but once you realize your profile is now made up of several different distinct pages (wall, info, etc.) it makes perfect sense and works smoothly.",1222766176

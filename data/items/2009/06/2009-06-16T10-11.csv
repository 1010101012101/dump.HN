659921,comment,659428,659851,0,0,Keyframe,,,"I can confirm that. Bangkok/Thailand can be both very cheap and extremely expensive, depends on what you eat, how you live. If you adjust your taste to thai food, you can get by pretty cheap, but even if you eat moderately fast food western food here and there like 112 pizza, food court in MBK (has great greek lamb!) toll can get up high pretty fast.<p>Living in BKK is another story, you can buy a decent house in a decent neighborhood for about 4 mil baht, which is cheap in my book. I have, due to the nature of my work, lived in nearby Salaya and commuted to shooting location and BKK with designated driver, prices of living there (only a 30 minute drive from BKK) are significantly lower than in BKK.",1245149814

I remember when Google introduced Gears someone on reddit or HN pointed to this extension. I was curious about it and tried it in my computer at work.<p>First of all, this thing works and it gets the job done. But it feels too hard to actually use it everyday for a non-geeky person. The point of Opera offering is not only the platform itself but also the list of Unite services they already provide (photo-sharing and fridge cover most of my needs).<p>I'm pretty sure one could use POW to ultimately bring Unite to Firefox.",1245149721

Think about a web-chat app that does asynchronous true push chat. No Comet and heavy JS.<p>It would work like this : you would connect to the web chat. Your browser would give the server an URL on its internal server where the server can post updates. Just like a webhook.

With userfly.com, we tried to make everything dead simple, and much cheaper than clicktale. We also focus on capturing quality user sessions (lots of page views, lots of actions fired per page, bounced users don't count against your quota).<p>However, at the end of the day, watching individual user sessions, one after another, doesn't really scale; you need a way to aggregate the data to identify trends that may suggest pain points for the end user, and we haven't really cracked that nut (and neither have our competitors).",1245149296
659910,comment,657098,658109,0,0,SecurityMatters,,," This is not ideological.  It is practical.  Adobe Flash exposes your system to a variety of vulnerabilities and is unlikely to get much better.  Adobe considers making the user vulnerable a feature and they brag about it to people they sell their commercial products to.  They also offer an unreasonable license to the player that sensible people refuse to accept.  So, if Ogg Theora allows embedded videos at comparable quality for the same bitrate, and websites like YouTube adopt it, then it is a big win for the user.  Sensible people can now play videos and we can recommend disabling Adobe Flash and so everyone is a winner.",1245149252

(As an example, a can of Coke costs 12 THB in a 7/11).<p>130k will buy you a lot of luxury in Thailand. You can get a very good condo for 30k per month. You can each out for every meal of every day for about 1.5k per diem, so 45k for food. That still leaves 55k for spending on going out, buying clothes, utilities, gadgets, etc. etc. That is more than ""comfortable"".<p>Even 70k per month is more than enough for a very comfortable lifestyle.

In Jakarta you can have a car and driver for less than the cost of a car in the US.<p>Personally, I think everyone should live in a different country for at least one (1) year. You'll gain a lot of perspective on your own country in the process. Just like learning another language teaches you more about your native tongue, so living in another country teach you about your own culture. Combine the two (new language, new country) for a serious eye opening.<p>For example, the Thai language has no words for ""yes"" or ""no"". There are no yes/no questions in Thai.<p>Only after being removed from pervasive US media do you recognize how much hollywood movie content is US centric and self-referential.<p>Honestly, if you love living in the US, go live somewhere else in the world for one year. You'll either love the US more, or you'll decide that you enjoy living somewhere else more than you anticipated. Either way, you'll have gained invaluable life experience.",1245147818

Using treated grey water, a bog was started at one end with rows and rows of sawgrass. The water that made it to the end was crystal clear.<p>After the experiments were done and went off to college, to pursue CS of all things. The district sold the land to developers who built yet another unneeded warehouse/stripmall in South Florida.<p>Later on the state and Fed went on to a billion dollar buying spree of tracts of land through the middle of the state.

659882,comment,658629,658757,0,0,seertaak,,,"> i also think if more bands embraced torrents, it would help them get their music heard.<p>That's a theory that hasn't been borne out by the evidence, and doesn't even stand to reason if you think about it. Let's label the 10,000 or so bands in existince in the UK alone, and let's assume each of them released an album every two years, in torrent form. The average listener would need to listen to 5,000 releases every year to stay up to date, or more than 14 or so new albums every day!<p>Of course that's not practical. So what's the solution? How do you whittle the number down to something manageable. Well, you could listen to just a subsample, but then you could be missing then next Fleet Foxes! Or the next Mozart.<p>No, the solution is for someone who really, really, thinks that band 7,819 is the new Fleet Foxes, as opposed to band 6,412, to <i>put his money where his mouth is</i> and advertise and publicise the band. And that's exactly what major record labels do. And that's why they are no more obsolete than publishing companies are. In effect, we pay labels some fraction of the album price to save us from having to dredge through myspace to find something listenable.<p>Unfortunately, for that to work people need to pay for their music. And for that to occur, government needs to crack down on filesharing. IMHO",1245146684

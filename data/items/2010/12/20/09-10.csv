2023836,comment,2023089,2023737,0,0,pavs,,,"It is true that everyone has their unique way of doing things, so I don't think there is a single ""right"" way of reading a book but a way that works for you.<p>But I want talk a little about the motivation behind reading books. I don't read books to be a genius or trying to solve a world problem or for the next big idea. I read purely out of intellectual curiosity and the pleasure of the reading experience. I also read mostly non-fiction books which I think requires a bit more mental involvement and slow reading than fictional books. I also don't speed read or skip parts.<p>>Do I remember the core lessons from each book? No.<p>>And that's a big problem. Usually with a book I try to figure out a few different take-aways and then implement them into my life. But unless I implement them immediately and convert them into habits, I will probably lose the lessons. A challenge I face as a reader, and perhaps why I have accumulated a small following as a writer, is figuring out how to convert ideas from a book into actionable habits.<p>I don't think there are enough original ideas out their that you will find in every single book you read that _you can apply in your life_. Specially in self-help books. If you have read 5-6 decent self-help (on time management, productivity) books chances are you have covered 95% of the important stuff out there. So instead of reading more self-help books to find something new or original (there are none, trust me) you are probably better off concentrating on the core lessons. Any more self-help books you will read will only reinforce the core ideas you already know about. You can also read them to get a different perspective of the known ideas too. I used to subscribe to every single popular self-help blog and have read most popular self-help books (before and after 2009). I also used to make rigorous notes. Over time I have fine tuned my notes and they have all comes down to three points.<p>Step 0: Say Calm.<p>Step 1: Decide what you want to do.<p>Step 2: Do it.<p>Of course this won't help everyone. But I know that those three point _really_ means. What it means to stay calm or why I should do it. What it means to emphasis on the _decision_ of what I want to do. And what it means to do something ""I have decided"" I will do. I don't have to remember the core messages of those books to apply the lessons I have learned.<p>But this is just one example on one type of books. I could use the same example to my other favorite topics ""Theoretical Physics"" and Neuropsychology"". After reading a decent amount of theoretical physics books on cosmology even the latest book by Stephen Hawking felt like ""meh"". When you read 10th book on cosmology that tells you the same thing by 10 different authors in 10 different ways, at that point you are not reading to ""learn something new"", you are looking for a different perspective on the same thing you already know. You might not consciously ""remember"" all the 10 different ways to explain the same thing, but subconsciously you have 10 different ways of thinking about the same problem.<p>I think going out of your way to actively 'remember' what you read and trying to learn something from each book you read and apply them to your life is a wasted energy and effort (IMHO). Chances are most of them are not applicable to your life.<p>Just enjoy reading a book.",1292836891

Social news sites distribute the filtering load across many different people, but collapse it in time - any given person spends about 2 seconds deciding whether to up- or down-vote a story.  The publishing industry collapses the filtering load across very few people (a handful of editors decide whether a book will be accepted or rejected for publication), but spreads it out over time (your editor will then work with you over a protracted period to make sure the work expresses your views as clearly and as fully as possible).<p>They seem to result in very different outcomes.

If you think it would be a really big deal to change names (in the worst case) then it might also be worth it.<p>What you should do in any case is check for existing trademarks.

We tend to think of browsing the internet as frivilous when compared to reading classic literature -- but is it really? With books, the individual ideas don't get filtered by up and down votes or what have you. You only get ideas from one person -- you don't get immediate dissenting views. People on the internet know attention is a scarce resource and make an effort to condense their ideas as much as possible. Long form has advantages, certainly; but perhaps a big reason we are so drawn to the internet is that it is actually the better use of time.",1292835716
2023802,comment,2022430,2022430,0,0,Andys,,,"I've recently done a project with puppet that turned out horribly.  I'll share what I discovered:<p>* Puppet's error messages are next to useless.  Sometimes it can only tell you which file had an error, and not which line number. Sometimes you'll be left wondering where in the many files that make up a complex project there was an error.<p>* The only way to actually test the correctness of your puppet scripts is to deploy on real servers.  Your staging environment has to be identical to production if you don't want any nasty surprises.<p>* Despite being written in ruby, the design doesn't follow ruby's philosophies or best practices.  The config language is not dynamic or ruby-ish.  Compared to ruby, you get code blowout when you can't use DRY and have to unroll loops to fit inside the bounds of what the config language can do.<p>* Simple things are hard. You have to write your own modules or use 3rd party modules for what I consider simple things, such as editing an existing system config file to add two lines in the middle if they don't already exist.<p>* There's a steep learning curve because a large project is like spaghetti code where you aren't quite sure which file to find what you're looking for.  It is very easy to create dependency loops, and hard to find them, and even harder to resolve them.  I ended up generating the dependency graph to a PNG file and eyeballing it, several times per day.<p>I got the impression that puppet is ideal for getting a ""PHP+MYSQL"" server up and running that requires almost no deviation from the operating system defaults.  If your setup is a more complex one I'd stay well away.",1292835694

I&#x27;ve also personally talked with some of the engineers who have shipped RISC-V cores in their products.<p>The issue though is that nobody HAS to tell us they used RISC-V (that&#x27;s part of the beauty of it). For small micro-controller type cores, the decision is made by some engineer to go with RISC-V instead of rolling his own ISA ($ and time are too tight to go external for a simple micro-controller), but that doesn&#x27;t mean he has the power to publicly announce to the world what tools and IP his company uses in its products.<p>Anyways, we&#x27;re trying to get more people to open up so we can help make a stronger case for RISC-V by using more success stories from industry.",1436986783

You need to account for it in both, with the population using the average value of time for that population.<p>The end result is that it is likely worth it for some people whose time is worth more than for others.<p>The only problem is the worth of time.  Is a CEO making $200/hr missing their kid&#x27;s baseball game really losing more than the $10/hr admin staff missing their kid&#x27;s baseball game?<p>>This is like the antibiotics trade-off. We don&#x27;t want the population to overuse antibiotics to avoid building resistance in the population. But if I&#x27;m sick, and there&#x27;s only a 10% chance that the antibiotic is useful (and 90% chance that my illness is viral and therefore the antibiotic is useless but otherwise harmless), then it&#x27;s still in my individual interest to take it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is all that related.  For antibiotics, the problem is that someone else taking an antibiotic has a cost to you (in bacteria becoming more resistant).  Thus, you taking it gets you a gain of 1000 at a cost of 1 but someone else taking it gets you a gain of 0 at a cost of 1.  This is an example of everyone using a strategy that helps them at the cost of others, which is a strategy that does not scale well when trying to maximize the gain of the whole group.  In the security example, if it is beneficial for the average person to use the &#x27;increased security&#x27; strategy, then the strategy is a net benefit when scaled (if done so evenly across the population, which may be a faulty assumption).<p>In short, security scales the benefit (or cost) evenly.  k gain for 1 person, kn gain for n people.  k Cost for 1 person, kn cost for n people.  Antibiotics does not.  (k - j) gain/cost for 1 person, n(k - nj) gain/cost for n people.<p>Edit:<p>To specify, the n(k - nj) is based on a person getting k benefit at j costs from using an antibiotic, while everyone else gets only j cost.  So one use of an antibiotic is 1 person get k benefit while n people get j cost, or (k - nj).  This is then multiplied by those n people each taking an antibiotic.",1436986604

The necessary conditions will vary by developer.  Some people thrive with regular teammate feedback.  Others like to pull a lonely all-nighter.

Some perform work-related rituals, like the morning coffee ceremony.<p>There is no single thing you can do, other than getting to know your co-workers.

That article seemed to be mainly against wholesale rewrites which I agree in a most cases.  He is now paying the price for taking this rule to the extreme. I think sometimes rewrites are unavoidable as tech on which the old code is based dies and the current code needs to continue to be extended. In Joel&#x27;s company case they slowly ended up having to write an entire compiler and language to keep their old code running.<p>Relevant passage:<p>&quot;First, there are architectural problems. The code is not factored correctly. The networking code is popping up its own dialog boxes from the middle of nowhere; this should have been handled in the UI code. These problems can be solved, one at a time, by carefully moving code, refactoring, changing interfaces. They can be done by one programmer working carefully and checking in his changes all at once, so that nobody else is disrupted. Even fairly major architectural changes can be done without throwing away the code. On the Juno project we spent several months rearchitecting at one point: just moving things around, cleaning them up, creating base classes that made sense, and creating sharp interfaces between the modules. But we did it carefully, with our existing code base, and we didn&#x27;t introduce new bugs or throw away working code.&quot;",1436985405

All the people I collaborate with online now, I know them by those exact names. Coworkers, remote collaborators, friends on instagram, famous software engineers (whose work I might want to consume), even my own brothers... I know them by a set of these identities. This is how I know people.<p>To illustrate this point: if my own brother wrote me a message and posted it simultaneously on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, I would think &quot;yeah, that&#x27;s my brother.&quot; Moreover, and more importantly, if he left those posts up publicly, over time the strength of my conviction that he actually wrote the messages (and it wasn&#x27;t a short-term compromise) would grow.<p>This works even for people you&#x27;ve maybe never met in real life. If hacker news user &quot;jashkenas&quot; announces on HN that he has a new version of CoffeeScript, I expect that&#x27;s him. If he pairs it with a tweet, then I really expect it&#x27;s him. The fact that this method works for possible strangers and loved ones is very powerful. Remember, this isn&#x27;t just about secure messaging. If someone doesn&#x27;t have any such identities, then there&#x27;s always still the fallback: exchange an identifier in person.<p>The alternatives are so nasty -- in person meeting, coordinating enterprisey apps, and so on -- we&#x27;ll never get anywhere with this kind of thing. The solution I think you are suggesting requires a lot of human effort to figure out if you have the person you want. This is one of the danger points of PKI. And one of the inconvenience points.<p>&quot;Leaving people to manage their own private keys is worse for security than having them managed by others.&quot; Part of me wonders if you&#x27;re just trolling. I don&#x27;t understand this, and I&#x27;ve read your paragraph a few times. There is the confusion argument - that people don&#x27;t understand how to manage them, which is a problem we&#x27;re tackling.  Our argument is that it&#x27;s possible to build something usable (finally!) where people do in fact own their own keys.<p>But you go on to say &quot;software glitches&quot; and &quot;updates&quot; are dangerous for individuals who have device keys, and then suggest they&#x27;d be ok if their enterprises / social networks managed their private keys for them. In this case, you&#x27;re talking about expanding the threats considerably, while still leaving client apps that need to be updated and do the work.",1436985197

9893119,comment,9891537,9892331,0,0,munchhausen,,,"> For an information worker there are huge health downsides to being inside at home all day, even with a full family around.<p>This statement strikes me as odd. I can&#x27;t really figure out what health downsides do you have in mind. Can you elaborate?<p>I would argue the opposite. Being an information worker in an office environment is deleterious to one&#x27;s health. Humans are not designed to sit around in poorly ventilated rooms for a larger part of the day(light), where the only recourse from the unpleasantness of the situation is a fridge stocked with free sweetstuffs and soda. I&#x27;ve been there, eaten the Snickers, and am much happier now that I&#x27;m working from home, where I am able to take a short walk around the neighborhood, do a couple of yoga asanas or other exercise or even take a short nap almost anytime I want. There&#x27;s also the fact that I can eat healthy food as per my liking, and not just one that is available in the cafeteria or nearby restaurants.<p>I am aware of the research and the reality of how important it is to not be alone all the time, but you really don&#x27;t need the daily office-going grind to protect yourself from those particular dangers. In fact, at the end of my workday, I am eager to go out and socialize, whereas in my office-worker days, all I could think of was going home, cracking open a cold beer to decompress, and hoping that I don&#x27;t have to talk to anyone for the rest of the day (not likely with family around).",1436984954

The below is a friendly disagreement from someone passingly interested in this field.<p>> First, people should have multiple keys/identities by default<p>I feel like you can do this already, no? Just create different Keybase accounts for each identity. I don&#x27;t understand how having a single keypair prevents you from managing your contact groups however you like. They seem like orthogonal problems to me.<p>> Second, matching a name with social media is the wrong way to lookup others. It only works if people put enough personally identifiable information (PII) on their social media accounts<p>Key verification is <i>the</i> problem in crypto. Like it or not, many people already put tons of PII online. It&#x27;s a perfectly valid way to verify lots and lots of people. Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t work for everybody, but it&#x27;s clear that keychains don&#x27;t work. This is a different strategy to solve the verification problem, and I think it&#x27;s got legs.<p>> Third, leaving people to manage their own private keys is worse for security than having them managed by others.<p>I understand your point here, but I disagree. Given all the server hacking going on these days, I&#x27;d much rather not have a single point of failure. Or several large points of failure, in the case of your distributed system. The odds of someone hacking keybase.io or keyexchange.google.com seem much higher than the odds of someone attacking <i>my</i> phone or <i>my</i> desktop.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake that keybase allows uploading and storing private keys.<p>> I think the winning solution will be: a distributed<p>Your idea doesn&#x27;t seem to solve the verification problem. Keybase&#x27;s strength is that in order to subsume someone&#x27;s identify, you have to hack several of their accounts. That&#x27;s much more difficult than hacking a single keyserver. How do you verify that the key I get when I search your crypto-DNS system for irq-1 actually belongs to you?",1436984805

Here&#x27;s the simplest practical advice I can offer: if you have any options vested and have not exercised, buy them immediately so that you become a voting shareholder. It will cost some $$ that you may never see back (tho hopefully very little, since angel-stage), but it will buy you some leverage. Even if it&#x27;s a fraction of a percent, as a shareholder you can vote on the transaction and even though the founders / angels will have a majority and be able to push the deal through regardless, dissenting shareholders are always a major concern for buyer/seller in M&A, and so you can have some impact on the deal.<p>Most deals like this will be set-up to have key employees and founders work for buyer at least 18-24 months, and while I understand you don&#x27;t want to do this the bottom line is in deals like this, developers like you, and your willingness to work on product integration, ARE the value so if you&#x27;re unwilling to do that then there may be no deal, but more likely you just won&#x27;t be able to realize very much of the deal&#x27;s value since the buyer will set it up to make sure only people who stick around are compensated. Not much you can really do about that.<p>In fact, if you want to be machiavellian about it all, one play would be to make your founders and buyer believe that you REALLY wanted to work at buyer so that buyer got comfortable with putting more of the consideration upfront and not-tied to vesting - this would be somewhat dishonest IMO but people do it (I&#x27;ve seen it happen for $200M+ deals...). Contra, if you expose that you don&#x27;t really want to work with buyer, they will certainly tie any consideration to vesting/earnout.<p>Best advice is be honest about what you want and ask for it (really the only people who can answer the rest of your questions are the founders and buyer - these are exactly the questions that get hammered out in deal terms), but also be empathetic and hear out why others might have different priorities - ultimately a deal like this is one team being absorbed by another team, all made out of people with divergent interests, so you just have to make compromises.",1436984639

His issues are 99% due to psychological issues from his combat service, not a tech-industry imposed Jim Crow Era (the <i>Driving Miss Daisy</i> comment in the article).<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever comment on a CIB on display, it seems about as appropriate as the proverbial ignorant question, &quot;Did you kill anybody?&quot;<p>A good half of my friends who returned from combat had significant difficulty fitting into normal American life, and experienced psychological and relationship issues.  I wish veterans groups would focus their rhetoric on that specific problem.  Pay for servicemembers has increased far beyond parity with civilian jobs for the vast majority of occupational specialties, the Post-9/11 GI Bill truly solves the post-service employment training issue, and the stigma of being a veteran is essentially nonexistent.  The hard problem that needs to be focused on is the significant therapy and rehabilitation need for the minority of veterans who actually were in combat.<p>What gets me is that he&#x27;s whining about his raw deal as a veteran (pysch issues aside, is nonexistent), but he fails to accept responsibility for his life choices of 1) graduating (for free) with what I presume is a creative writing degree and failing to take internships, 2) failing to live in an affordable city (what&#x27;s wrong with living in Oakland or Union City and driving over the Bay Bridge?), and 3) lamenting his lack of money as he wastes it at the bar (presumably in SoMa, and expensive).<p>The reason for the above is not because he&#x27;s intentionally avoiding reality, it&#x27;s because veterans often self-segregate in veterans groups.  He lives in the TL because that&#x27;s where his veterans organization operates (originally for Vietnam War vets with a more dire situation than his).  Hopefully now that his Vice article has gotten him some more exposure, he&#x27;ll have more interaction with non-vets and gain some perspective.",1436984470

How long will it take you to move your stuff to the new office location?<p>> Is there typically any short-term payout for acquired employees or will everything be in salary and slow-vesting options?<p>Yes there is typically a short term payout for key employees. both of the acquisitions I was involved in resulted in a large bonus up front but the majority of the total value is usually vested over time. In both instances, if I left before a year was out, I would have to payback the initial bonus.<p>> what&#x27;s the likelihood I&#x27;d be allowed to remain in charge of my product vs having to execute on someone else&#x27;s vision?<p>You will have technical ownership but you will have to execute someone else&#x27;s vision.

If you are considered an employee, then it&#x27;s appropriate to negotiate your individual transition to the new company. That being said, don&#x27;t underestimate your value to the acquirer. Product acquisitions are usually contingent on key employees agreeing to transfer to the new company. Therefore, don&#x27;t accept their initial offer. You have leverage. The first acquisition I was involved in, the owner of the company agreed to transfer some of his proceeds of the sale to bonuses to employees so he could reach the tipping point with the number of employees that agreed to go to the new company.

At Pusher we use a fork of SockJS for HTTP fallback but we actually use em-websocket [1] (ruby) for our WebSocket API. Given the opportunity we&#x27;d probably move away from SockJS to something much simpler because we only want the HTTP fallback part and it only handles < 8% of our connections.<p>If you _only_ want WebSocket connections with no HTTP fallback then Faye WebSocket [2] may be an option. But any production application is going to require fallback for older browsers and pesky proxies/firewalls.<p>Faye [3] is solid (obviously used Faye WebSocket), has implementations in Node and Ruby, but is a PubSub solution. I&#x27;d kinda argue that any real-time app needs at least PubSub functionality anyway.<p>The ws Node module [4] is apparently &quot;The fastest RFC-6455 WebSocket implementation for Node.js&quot; and receives contributions from 3rd-Eden who is also behind Primus [5].

Unfortunately not all windows commands accept SIDs, and you&#x27;ll need to know the localized name for the &#x27;everyone&#x27; group to call them. Windows&#x27;s troubled languagepack journey and backwards compatibility shackles do mean that design decisions on basic file-handling commands that were reasonable in 1995 look pretty dumb now.<p>PowerShell <i>is</i> making this better, but of course when you &#x27;shell out&#x27; from PSH to a legacy command you&#x27;re stuck with its crappy commandline parsing which is designed to be backwards compatible with batch files written 20 years ago. The powershell way to do this (assuming &#x27;set-owner&#x27; isn&#x27;t built in to PSH) is probably to end-run round takeown.exe and work with the shell win32 APIs directly (or google for a cmdlet someone else has written that does that for you).",1436983244

I really like this approach because it feels more RESTful, has less overhead, and even allows the browser to do a `createServer`. It is currently pretty tightly coupled into a project of mine (next bullet), I&#x27;ll try pulling it out into its own library if there is demand, but here is the source:<p>- - Client library, <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/gun.js#L1138"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/gun.js#L1138</a> and onwards.<p>- - Server library, <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/wsp.js#L8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/wsp.js#L8</a> and onwards.<p>- - Really nifty HTTP normalizer, <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/http.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/http.js</a> .<p>- - Really nifty WebSocket normalizer, same format, <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/ws.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/ws.js</a> .<p>- - Really nifty JSONP normalizer, same format, <a href=""https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/jsonp.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/lib/jsonp.js</a> .<p>- If you do use the P2P Socket.IO feature, the next thing you&#x27;ll need is a P2P database that can run in the browser! And that is what my main open source project, <a href=""http://gunDB.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gunDB.io/</a> is about.

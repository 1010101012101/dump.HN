The larger email providers can charge these newsletters, and the newsletters are assured of guaranteed delivery.<p>That said, I am sure I am not the first one to come up with this, anyone doing this already?",1217673448

It's difficult to unsubscribe or takes more than 3/4 steps<p>2.) Unsubscribe requests are not honored<p>3.) I have run out of filters to directly move that email to trash (was a problem in Yahoo. not in gmail)",1217673107

Just ""defmacro"" and get back to solving your real problem.",1217672392

So there's really no reason to not use CL, unless of course you don't like CL.",1217672255

Quiet environments, often excellent views (most libraries seem to be in the best parts of town) and some even have areas you can lie down (meant more for people to read than nap, but many people do it) or big grassy areas surrounding them.",1217671344

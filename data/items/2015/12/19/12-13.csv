If you just worked your way up the promotion ladder you would have done super well financially (better than the SP500 by 4-5x).<p>The problem with any comparison is hindsight. Many other large cap tech stocks do not behave that way. Certainly you could have joined Microsoft at a certain time and &quot;given up&quot; at the &quot;wrong time&quot;. Your cash comp might have been quite good (or not).<p>The thing to ask yourself (and I definitely am not judging or implying one way or another) is where does your code go and what does it do? A lot of that IBM code, well... And of course many startups don&#x27;t make it as well.<p>If all you want is money with low risk the choice is clear. If all you want is a chance at a huge payoff with high risk then the choice is clear.<p>If you&#x27;re happy with the end result of your code then in a Fountainhead sort of way that&#x27;s what matters. Then whichever risk path you take for your compensation is secondary. And your views on this might change at different life stages.<p>Finally the ability and skills to navigate and succeed in either a startup or a big company are different. Depending on when you choose and how you grow and evolve you may or may not be at the right place at the right time.<p>That&#x27;s my shortest comment to a very long topic :)",1450529866

It&#x27;s a rather intense job, and I ensure that I&#x27;m aware of the &quot;status&quot; of each of the 6 employees. If they&#x27;re feeling unwell or worn out, I&#x27;ll tell them to do the simpler jobs.\nIt&#x27;s much like a typical retail job with handling of stock and money.. but there&#x27;s a very important difference: we have strict procedures to follow for mail, money and identity services. I&#x27;ve told the staff that the procedures set out by Australia Post are paramount and that their &quot;habits&quot; when dealing with customers must ensure everything is verified and triple-checked.<p>Unfortunately, some of the staff have developed lazy habits. They easily notice any issues when it&#x27;s quiet, they&#x27;re feeling good and performing a typical transaction. However if it&#x27;s busy, they&#x27;re distracted or handling an unusual transaction, they are prone to making mistakes.<p>How do I help them develop better habits? If they are willing to change but having trouble, what do I do? If they are unwilling to change, what do I do?<p>I really don&#x27;t want to micromanage, but they&#x27;re simply making too many mistakes and we may be liable for them.\nI&#x27;ve told them at times to go slower yet their comfort with their habits makes them go quickly even if I tell them to take their time and double check.\nIf I make a checklist for them to go through in the longer transactions, they just check every box without truly thinking about it.<p>Any advice would be appreciated.",1450528950

Haskell is a great language for expressing computations, the thing CS is about. It&#x27;s not meant to flip bits and observe processor states and page faults, if that is your idea of fun. That&#x27;s more computer engineering stuff.<p>But Haskell is absolutely capable of drawing pretty circles on the screen in just a couple of lines of code![1]<p>[1]: <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss-1.9.4.1/docs/Graphics-Gloss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss-1.9.4.1/docs/Graph...</a>",1450527515

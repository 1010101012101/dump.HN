5157103,comment,5152298,5155924,1,0,steveklabnik,,,"> we also live in a society and, as hackers, in a sub-culture where we generally prize reason and debate over emotion.<p>This is an ideal, but it's not true at all. Look at all the 'dramas' posted all over HN, does that seem like reason to you, or emotion?<p>Hackers are people too, as much as they try to deny it.<p>> who else is going to do it?<p>Either them themselves, or someone else. I think maybe this comes from a slight misunderstanding of what the saying means. Let's say that Bob makes a joke about rape around Alice, a survivor. Alice says ""yo, that is not cool, and you're making light of a trauma I experienced in the past."" Bob says ""Why?"" Alice says, ""I don't want to explain it to you, I'm really upset right now."" The saying is trying to explain that it's not _Alice_'s responsibility to make Bob see exactly where he went wrong; he can either look at the numerous resources online to explain why, think about it and puzzle it out himself, or maybe, ask Eve or someone else about it. But forcing Alice to confront something in her moment of pain is just not right.<p>>  I think the hacker community prizes rationalism and if you want to persuade them of anything you should use rational and not emotional arguments.<p>This is _exactly_ why there's so much sexism here. The rhetoric around this is extremely frustrating, especially with your charge of 'abandons rationalism.'",1359835108

A very small percentage of the 2 million papers published each year is available online for free.<p>I'd love to see data on this, so I can see <i>why</i> my experience is atypical: are conventions different in some fields than others?  Do I just have good luck?  Am I misremembering or just wrong (which is possible)?  The original article states, ""Much of the work produced in academia is never seen by anyone outside that cloistered world, because everyone who’s not affiliated with a university is cut off from access"" and I'd really like to know exactly which articles Manjoo has looked for and been unable to find w/out a university license.  Institutional access needs to be a lot more comprehensive than what almost any individual needs access to, so I don't think that their subscription costs really are compelling evidence against my experience.<p>I'm kind of surprised that no one's pointed out an easy and really effective step MIT could take unilaterally: make all of the journals the MIT Press publishes open access (MIT is also a publisher).  Some of them are among the best journals in their fields (e.g. the <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i> is one of the 4 most prestigious journals in econ and the <i>Review of Economics and Statistics</i> is very very good).",1359834799

Of those, I may respond to 2-4.  Any more would simply be too large a drain on my time; email already occupies several hours of my day, and the payoff just isn't there to justify increasing that, since it would come at the expense of other things I feel are higher priority, like spending time with the people I care about.<p>I've actually been thinking about performing an experiment: you can pay me $X to send me an email.  If $X > $Y, I'll guarantee a response (and a thoughtful one, at that), and I'll respond to the current highest paid email first, in case of inundation.

Singapore was settled earliest by ethnic groups similar to those in current Malaysia, with a big influx of wretchedly poor agricultural laborers for plantation labor during the British colonial period. It was not expected in the pre-independence period (which extended into my lifetime) that Singapore would ever be prosperous. (You can watch a videotape of the movie Saint Jack, which was filmed in Singapore, for a reminder of the poverty in Singapore as recently as in the early 1970s.)<p>But the early leadership of independent Singapore strongly emphasized effective generally available primary education (without at first even making school attendance compulsory) and studied the best international examples of sound textbooks and effective teaching practice.<p><a href=""http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>School pupils in Singapore from my generation (born in the late 1950s) grew up in a country that was extremely poor (it's hard to remember that about Singapore, but until the 1970s Singapore was definitely part of the Third World). People from Singapore are so ethnically diverse that Singapore has four official languages from four different language families. All the school pupils were educated in a foreign language (the language of schooling in Singapore has long been English, but the home languages of most Singaporeans are south Chinese languages like my wife's native Hokkien or Austronesian languages like Malay or Indian languages like Tamil). Official surveys by the Singapore government<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore#Languages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore#Langu...</a><p>show that as recently as 1990, Singapore had no majority language among the various languages that people speak in their homes, and the plurality language category was category including more than one language, none of which are even one of the offical languages of Singapore. Yet young people growing in that generation, going to school in a language they generally didn't speak at home, received very thorough instruction in mathematics and science and other subjects.<p>Today Singapore is prosperous, and one set of projections suggests it is on track to be the richest country in the world on a per-capita basis by 2050.<p><a href=""http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/15/singapore-worlds-richest-country-by-2050/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/15/singapore...</a>",1359833847

You just say what you want to compute:<p><pre><code>    > (def my-fields {:y (stats :y count)\n                      :x (stats :x count)\n                      :both (stats #(+ (or (:x %) 0) (or (:y %) 0)) count sum mean)})\n</code></pre>\nand the sets that are of interest:<p><pre><code>    > (def my-sets (-> (sets {:has-y #(contains? % :y})\n                       (complement :has-y))) ;; could also take intersections, unions\n</code></pre>\nAnd then run it with some data:<p><pre><code>    > (calculate my-sets my-fields [{:x 1 :y 2} {:x 10} {:x 4 :y 3} {:x 5}])\n    {:not-has-y\n     {:y {:count 0}, :x {:count 2}, :both {:mean 7.5, :sum 15, :count 2}},\n     :has-y\n     {:y {:count 2}, :x {:count 2}, :both {:mean 5.0, :sum 10, :count 2}},\n     :all\n     {:y {:count 2}, :x {:count 4}, :both {:mean 6.25, :sum 25, :count 4}}}\n</code></pre>\nThe functions :x, :y, and #(+ (or (:x %) 0) (or (:y %) 0)) defined in\nthe fields map are called once per input element no matter how many\nsets the element contributes to. The function #(contains? % y) is also\ncalled once per input element, no matter how many unions,\nintersections, complements, etc. the set :has-y contributes to.<p>A variety of measure functions, and structured means of combining\nthem, are supplied; it's also easy to define additional measures.<p>babbage also supplies a method for running computations structured as\ndependency graphs; this can make gathering the initial data for\nsummarizing simpler to express. To give an example that's probably\nfamiliar from another context:<p><pre><code>    > (defgraphfn sum [xs]\n        (apply + xs))\n    > (defgraphfn sum-squared [xs]\n        (sum (map #(* % %) xs)))\n    > (defgraphfn count-input :count [xs]\n        (count xs))\n    > (defgraphfn mean [count sum]\n        (double (/ sum count)))\n    > (defgraphfn mean2 [count sum-squared]\n        (double (/ sum-squared count)))\n    > (defgraphfn variance [mean mean2]\n        (- mean2 (* mean mean)))\n    > (run-graph {:xs [1 2 3 4]} sum variance sum-squared count-input mean mean2)\n    {:sum 10\n     :count 4\n     :sum-squared 30\n     :mean 2.5\n     :variance 1.25\n     :mean2 7.5\n     :xs [1 2 3 4]}\n</code></pre>\nOptions are provided for parallel, sequential, and lazy computation of\nthe elements of the result map, and for resolving the dependency graph\nin advance of running the computation for a given input, either at\nruntime or at compile time.",1359833558

What you do during a match is start to run very fast then stop immediately, then run in the other direction.  That's what you're going to be training to do now."".<p>These are two different conceptions of training.  To me the first one doesn't make much sense but YMMV.<p>Then the other issue is that, as has been pointed out, nobody is coding like that anymore: editors do close matching parenthesis, brackets, etc. and you enter ""fi"" and then hit <TAB> and the skeleton of a ""for (int i = 0; i < ...; i++) {"" appears, you start to type the first three letters of any method, function, variable and use some expand functionality to get the auto-completion, etc.<p>The way I did taught myself to touch-type is simple: read about the very basics of touch-typing (or ask any secretary to teach you: it basically takes two minutes -- that's what I did), buy an ""otaku"" keyboard or set of keycaps (a keyboard on which the keys are ""blank""), put your index fingers respectively on 'f' and 'j' and start... working!<p>To me doing what you're actually going to do, just like Agassi's trainer would advice, is the best way to learn.<p>Not some ""technique"" or ""method"" that people still don't know if it makes any sense or not.<p>Think outside the box.",1359833302

Root installed packages (like the ones from ports) would already be attended through the root installed RubyGem.<p>Aside from OpenBSD which has their security procedures for installed software it doesn't seem like any ports distro really <i>need</i> to have copies of gems in their package tree if the RubyGems package is set up correctly. They could delegate that function to RubyGems, it'd be transparent to the user.<p>Some package managers go down a more drastic route and simply tell the user to install the dependency through the correct package manager (Homebrew does that with Node, top of my mind). Users can still do it locally with rbenv/rvm/chruby if they want, it doesn't change much.<p>The bigger I'd think is that they don't want to rely on external package managers for the stability of their system. Which is a very valid reason, if RubyGems is out you can't install certain ports. Or worse, the gems aren't safe.

Notice that each filter function must take exactly one argument, which matches the return type of the previous filter-function in the pipeline.<p><pre><code>  composing-func = (previous-result, filter) -> {\n    apply(filter, previous-result)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow looking at our available functions, we can use currying and partial function application to pre-fill-in some arguments needed so that their input and output types line up:<p><pre><code>  list-of-filter-functions = [\n    flatmap(keys),\n    map(tostring),\n    unique(compare-strings),\n    sort(compare-strings),\n    concat("","")\n  ]\n</code></pre>\nAnd actually, we're now done. All of our filter functions have been partially applied as a sort of initialization for a complicated pipeline.<p>I'm guessing that currying and partial function application are useful in building parsers (like haskell & scala's parser combinators) but I don't know.",1359832033

Which means ""is even anyone else in the house"" or other such factors do not enter into it. Which in turn means this isn't teaching politeness, this is like teaching a dog; no disrespect to dogs intended, but I mean that they usually just learn what to do, not why (which is fine in the case of a dog, unacceptable for a kid).<p>Maybe it just seems like being dramatic to you because I'm actually paying attention to the finer details here, and you don't. I complain about this specific case, and you defend it because there's sometimes a reason to tell a kid to not yell etc... which is funny, but not quite the rebuttal you imagine it to be.<p><i>Telling a kid to quiet down while playing a PC game is simply to teach them to respect the presence of others around them.</i><p>I completely agree; what in anything I wrote makes you think I don't? And what about the topic makes you think what is being done here?<p>Though I would add that I wouldn't want to be the person who doesn't sometimes also get joy out of the loud expression of joy from others. Depends on what you're doing etc.,.. so respect also means letting the kids holler sometimes. Respect doesn't just go one way, and if you haven't made children to become happy humans, what have you made them for?<p>But don't get sidetracked, remember: The parent in question does NOT tell their kids ""I want you to be more quiet, so I made this script"", they outright lie (and proudly report that it's working, too), and even seek to automate it just to put a hard cap on the loudness levels of their kids.<p>And that's okay because it's effective, gets the desired result, case closed...? Well pah, I disagree, just like I also frown upon telling kids they should be nice so Santa gives them presents; not because I am against being nice, but because I'm against the layer of indirection and dishonesty.<p>This is the second time I responded to a strawman, and I find that telling in and of itself. I have nothing against something the parent in question isn't even doing, I have something against what they actually are doing. Is that so hard to understand? You don't turn kids into ""good adults"" by not taking them seriously and telling them the computer is annoyed by loud noise... What. The. Fuck.

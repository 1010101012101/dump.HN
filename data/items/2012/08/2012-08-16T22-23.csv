In economics if you can commoditize the complements to your product, then you can sell your own product at premium rate.<p>People call console themselves by talking about app experience etc, and even though app experience is important, i believe experience is not why apps are sold at shitty 99cents. Apple's strategy was to commoditize apps and guess what they succeeded.<p>My conclusion is that there is little or no hope for paid app or any breakthrough success for the majority of app developers. It was not meant to be, because that will affect  the appeal of the iphone which  will in turn lead to a drop in demand which will in turn force down the price of iphone and ipads.

4394105,comment,4390885,4393822,1,0,Jach,,,"I suppose I should have said leaking <i>at all</i> has some quantity of courage attached to it, since you're messing with a government entity that pretty much by definition is more powerful than the individual and whose members are just as self-preserving as any other humans. A lot of people sure regard Deep Throat as courageous. Do you just consider him a criminal? It takes more courage to not even try being anonymous about it, though I think the leaker is categorically more courageous than the publisher, so I wouldn't say Assange is more courageous than Manning.<p>My point about Manning is that he could form an idea about what would happen to him if he got caught doing what he considered the right thing. Similarly, Assange could form an idea of what harassment and possibly jail time he'd have to go through by controlling the first distribution channel. Typically people consider taking such known risks courageous, with foolishness often tagging along.<p>> Different strokes for different folks............<p>Well yes, I could argue that participating in the US military at all within the last decade is a display of complete cowardice--character cowardice, moral cowardice, and intellectual cowardice. I could argue that courage is just foolishness, that they're not separate things but the same thing, and that medals award stupidity. There are many ways to disagree on the nature of courage, what's your point with toting out your family? Just to display one of the ways? Fair enough.",1345157880

My building has a huge stolen package problem, due to the front door facing a main road, and the UPS driver for our area being an idiot.  My last building had a driver who never left anything if you weren't home.  While that's better than theft, it's still annoying to take two buses and walk ten minutes to pick up a package by hand.  And then walk ten more minutes and take two more buses to carry the thing home.  The whole process usually took upwards of two hours.<p>My only concern is getting the drivers to actually use these things correctly.  I've found multiple packages addressed to me left outside the front door, despite explicit instructions not to do that both given by the shipper and posted on the door.  Each of these packages were apparently signed for... just not by anyone who lives here.  So yeah, getting the driver to follow instructions isn't going to be easy.",1345157485

At worst, of having intercourse without a condom, against someone's momentary preference. With women who otherwise already willingly went to bed with him and became sexual partners with him. Neither woman wants charges against him. The documented reason why they approached the police originally was just to learn if he could be compelled to have an STD test performed. That's it. Also the original prosecutor who looked at it decided there wasn't anything to pursue, and not enough evidence to convict on anything. If you look at all the details of the case, and I mean ALL the details and <i>context</i>, I think there is only one of a few things that probably happened: either (1) it was a frame-up that the women were in on, or (2) it was not a frame-up by the women, not intentionally, they were honest, but some particular party in the Swedish government or law enforcement decided to ""make hay"" out of this as much as they could to hurt or impede Assange. Either of those scenarios seem to be the most consistent with everything known and observed to date.<p>Also I'm sure there have been millions if not billions of incidents of sex across the world, to date, if not happening again every day, where one or both participants preferred, either beforehand, or during, or afterward, that a condom was used, even though it wasn't, and in 99.99% of those cases nobody considers it ""rape"". At most, a non-ideal incident, a risky event, or something to get angry about with one's partner, in private. But I'm sure it's a very common occurrence, both between singles and married couples, and in the vast majority of cases it doesn't turn into claims of rape or major international diplomatic incidents. It's just one of those life oopsies. I bet a lot of children were brought into this world because of this kind of oopsie, however non-ideal. Regardless, it's a fact that they went to bed with him willingly. It's a fact that neither appeared distraught or made any complaints about it to friends afterward. It's a fact that there were no signs of violence or physical harm. Also it's a fact that a large percentage of women fantasize about dominant men, sexually. Is it possible that in this case Assange was too aggressive and insensitive? Absolutely! And who's business should that be? At most, Assange and these two other individuals. Period. End of story. And ultimately, those are the only people who really know, for sure, what <i>really</i> happened, and how it happened.

4394053,comment,4391721,4392607,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"Lenovo Thinkpads have (optionally) Authentec sensors.  The way it works is that the fingerprints are stored in the sensor itself.  Also stored is a password (or equivalent).  Swiping the appropriate finger then makes the password available.  Consequently you can either provide the password or the fingerprint.  It really is just a shortcut to providing the password.  (Note that all other sensor manufacturers are effectively just a cheap scanner - the image processing and ""authentication"" are all done in the host software.)<p>On the most recent Thinkpads you can swipe your finger to power on the device, get past the password protected BIOS, unlock ATA password locked drives, boot and login to Windows.  (Or you can enter your password 3 times.)<p>The sensor requires a swipe unlike large form sensors where you effectively leave your fingerprint behind. This is definitely an improvement.<p>Fingerprint data can also be loaded for use outside of the boot process, such as an ""Enterprise"" where you want to manage multiple systems and allow centrally managed logins.  Authentec also makes client software that keeps your passwords (think ones stored by the browser) in a vault with access controlled by fingerprint or master password.<p>In this whole scenario fingerprints can be revoked by deleting them from the sensor or management software.  However you only have ten prints before you run out.  You can be observed unknowingly so passwords can also be compromised just like with latent fingerprints.  It is up to someone to decide if the security tradeoffs of the Authentec scanner are acceptable.  For the record I do use it on my laptop.<p>But I'm actually a Linux user so I can only it for BIOS power on and ATA drive unlock, but not Linux authentication.  Authentec do not document their protocols or provide evidence of their security.  Small subsets have been reverse engineered (see libfprint).",1345157006

Apps do not connect at a human level the same way a person selling you a cup of coffee does. Even for mega corporations like Starbucks, at the end of the day, you interact with a Barista or someone at the cash register. We being creatures of habit, tend to go back to the same Starbucks (mostly), and in the process bolster this connection.
That doesn't happen with an app. You might go back to the app every day, but there is no tangible connection with the craftsman. So what exactly can be done? For starters, one can associate the developer's name and face with the app. I think this is particularly important for Free apps. If you've ever used Adblock on Safari, at the end of the setup, there's a note that ""humanizes"" the app as being the creation of a person. You get to see the name and a photo.<p>One of my favourite mobile apps, Instapaper, has the developer leaving tiny personal messages during app updates. I know his name, the fact that he recently had a baby and at some basic level it helps me connect to the person.<p>Does this make any sense?",1345156989

I was very satisfied with the quality of the photos, but the experience wasn't as nice as this article, and it cost about five times more than their competition.  At a 5x price premium for 4x6 (and 5x5 Instagram prints are double the 4x6 price), I'm not sure there could possibly be enough ease of use to turn me into a regular customer.<p>And I didn't see all this fantastic ease of use - the uploader got stuck and did not display the result a few times, and the browse has no good clear-to-me way to view large images before selecting and uploading them, so if you have 2 shots of the same thing you have to tab out to an external photo viewer to pick the better one.  I ended up doing all my picture selection in picasa then hunting for filenames in picplum.<p>I liked the quality but I just wasn't impressed enough to justify using it regularly.  Apparently they have some good ideas like you can set it up where you e-mail pictures in and they batch them up and mail them out to your family, but  that just seems to me like a way to rack up another cell phone sized bill each month.",1345154777

Instead of a rigid ship date, Joel's method can give you a probability of shipping on a given date with the current information.

4393895,comment,4392189,4392189,1,0,bfe,,,"As best as I understand it, no other sterilization techniques we have are nearly as effective as launching an object into space for several months or more. So, unless it's directed to portions of a spacecraft that are meaninfully protected from radiation, vacuum, and heat throughout the craft's voyage, pre-launch sterilization doesn't seem to have much purpose.<p>No sterilization technique is 100% perfect, and whatever contamination might happen is strongly determined by the one mission with the least effective sterilization, which is probably about equal as determined by the interplanetary environment, with variations for duration of flight and strength of solar radiation spikes (and assuming no significant variation over time in cosmic rays). To the extent pre-launch sterilization makes any difference, the earliest landers on other planets probably had the least effective sterilization techniques. For example, the Viking landers were sterilized by exposure to heat at 111 degrees Celsius, but the known upper limit of survival and proliferation temperature for thermophilic archaeans has since increased several times, with the most recent value I'm aware of at 122 degrees Celsius. The Soviet Union landed several probes on Mars and had a program of sterilizing them, but I'm not aware of the details. There was at least one science fiction story where astronauts on Mars discovered microbes that turned out to have evolved from microbes from one of the Soviet landers.<p>We also know that interplanetary space is not a sterile barrier over long time scales, and that there has been exchange of rocky material between Earth and Mars throughout the history of the Solar System, of which ALH84001 is a recent example. It's conceivable that radiation-hardened microbes such as deinococcus radiodurans could survive the radiation exposure of the trip, while the interiors of such rocks could protect them from the thermal spikes and mechanical shocks of excavation and landing.<p>Even what precautions our anti-contamination policies have included might have been counterproductive, such as sending the Galileo probe into the atmosphere of Jupiter to prevent the chance of it striking one of the Galilean moons in the future. Even if Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are all teeming with life in sub-surface oceans, it seems like having a 50-ish mile shield of ice between the ocean and a crash-landed probe sitting in the vacuum and hard radiation environment of space is pretty good insurance. But the choice was dictated by humanity's assumption of lots of liquid water as a paramount determinant of the possibility of life. That might be chauvinistic based on our biosphere sample size of one. If you relax your assumptions for the conditions necessary for life to arise and evolve to just a relatively stable space with chemical complexity and energy, the atmospheres of the gas giants become candidates. If you integrate the possibility of life first arising over a volume of space as well as duration of time for the candidate environment, Jupiter becomes overwhelmingly the most likely candidate environment in the solar system for life to have arisen. And unlike the thick ice envelopes of the moons, exposure of the Galileo probe to any portion of the atmosphere of Jupiter is potentially exposure to the entirety of the planet.<p>It makes sense to take reasonable precautions, but we can't expect to be able to ensure 100% lack of contamination from any spacecraft. And while there are good analytical reasons to believe there is no threat from back contamination to the Earth's biosphere from possible extraterrestrial microbes from a robotic or crewed sample return mission, there's no substitute for experimental evidence, in the form of living things from Earth living and growing on Mars without being hermetically sealed from the Martian environment. It would be fantastic to land at least a robotic greenhouse on Mars, like Chris McKay and then Elon Musk were promoting several years ago, and be able to watch plants and flowers from Earth growing on Mars.<p>Ultimately, it's not any more unlikely for Earth life to spread to Mars as it was for life on Earth to spread out of the oceans and onto land.",1345154540

Not only is it gratuitous trite salaciousness for its own sake, I wouldn't be surprised if it's actually damaging to LGBT causes -- the more people see ""____-sexual"" being used to refer to matters of choice, not innate aspects of the psyche, the easier they will find it to dismiss, y'know, <i>actual</i> sexualities as the same.

Often the path is already being set at the Kindergarten age with inept teachers who are unable to properly educate foreign speaking pupils. From then on it's a direct path to the Realschule and later a string of two or three failed attempts at getting a professional education (as a semi-skilled cook, hair stylist, whatever)<p>My brother was sent to the Realschule because of a primary teacher who habitually hit the pupils he hated - he was a sadistic tyrant.<p>Roughly a decade later, My brother graduated in law and is now on path of becoming a very successful (and rich) international arbitration specialist.<p>Now obviously, not everyone will be able to turn the tide.<p>Another reality you seem to ignore is the fact that even intelligent people can be rowdy assholes.<p>My Gymnasium (high school) class was filled with them.

3884307,comment,3883682,3884065,4,0,AerieC,,,"Maybe ""the real world"" isn't the right term, but high school certainly is an isolated, controlled, and artificial environment compared to the rest of the outside world. The kids are locked down and have little to no freedom and little to no control over their environment. Also, some things that are socially acceptable in high school are NOT socially acceptable in an adult workplace.<p>In that sense, high school is not ""the real world"", because high school students don't have the same freedom or the same tools to deal with obnoxious people as they otherwise would in the adult world. In ""the real world"", you have legal recourse if someone in your workplace is harassing you. You can get a restraining order. You can talk to your H.R. department. You can sue your workplace and/or the person if you've taken the above steps and nothing has been done. You can quit your job and get a new one. In high school you have none of those luxuries. Unless the harassment is extreme, there is very little likelihood of getting a restraining order against another student. Furthermore, getting a restraining order is not something a high schooler can do on their own (they would need help from their parents). You can talk to the administration at the school, but they don't have the same power, nor the same incentive to avoid lawsuits (although this is changing) as a company's H.R. department. Also, many school administrators are still of the mindset that ""kids will be kids"" when it comes to bullying/harassment, and are unwilling to do anything about the issue. Finally, a high schooler cannot simply quit high school like an adult can quit his or her job. Again, it involves their parents's help.<p>That is the difference between high school and ""the real world"". In the real world, harassment is a serious legal issue; in high school, it's just ""kids will be kids"". In the real world, you have at least a modicum of control over your environment; in high school, kids have no control. In the real world, actions have consequences; in high school, apparently, they do not.",1335280824

Likewise, holding all-hands meetings where most people have better things to do and only 25% of the room cares about what is being discussed at any given moment is rarely a good investment of time.<p>On the other hand, having live interactions with colleagues and real face time is <i>vastly</i> more productive in some contexts than having everyone call into a Skype conference/available on IM/screen-sharing. Communication is simply much more efficient face-to-face than over any remote channel. If you have more than two or three people who need to work closely together, then body language really matters, and the ability to do simple things like scribble a diagram on a bit of paper or have a couple of guys step out for a minute to work through some details without holding up the rest of the group is indispensable.<p>(I have similar views on flexible hours, BTW. If you allow complete flexibility, to the point where you can no longer rely on the ""early"" guys overlapping with the ""late"" guys for more than a token amount of time, communication because a significant burden.)<p>This doesn't mean everyone needs to be in the office full-time, of course, and I'm all in favour of allowing telecommuting and flexible hours when there's no reason not to.

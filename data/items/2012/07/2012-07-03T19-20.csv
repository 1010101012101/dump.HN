The surface version of the logo, especially, bothers me; it feels off-balance due to the size of the geometric block and its placement.<p>Personal issues with the design aside, I also don't think the overall idea is any good. Microsoft as a whole doesn't need to be futuristic or hip or apple-ish. For its corporate customers especially, I think this would be counter-productive. Instead, they should take Microsoft Research and really DO SOMETHING with it. Such as attaching an accelerator of sorts, where small groups of entrepreneurs/innovators can take something MS Research has developed and see if they can make a marketable product out of it.<p>Surface really feels like the case in point here - they're how many years behind in finally releasing something to the consumer market? I remember reading that the cool desk in the The Island (2005, two years prior to the iPhone) was a MS research surface prototype or something; and yet it took them another four years to get a product out, and they priced it at 10k and sold it to phone retailers. Phone retailers! What the actual fuck?! Today, all of that seems to have fallen by the wayside in favor of tablets. It feels like MS is following the TSA model - wait until something big happens, then do something about it, instead of the other way around.<p>Anyway, if MS Research got a new logo that could be attached to semi-independent MS-funded experimental projects aimed at getting something to market, I could see a futuristic/high-tech branding being a useful thing to have. For MS in general, I don't.",1341345586

I was at a company (rather large internet company) that did not get rid of under performers. When I arrived what had collected was mostly senior engineers that in all frankness should not be let near a source control system much less be allowed to commit changes. There was so little engineering talent but thousands of engineers. And this is an impossible problem to fix without wholesale firing entire orgs since competent engineers don't want to work in a team of people with equal or higher level than them who don't know the difference between a compiler and an interpreter.<p>While there we did do stack ranking. Its just another game to play inside a company, just like all the other games that go on. It was easy to play that system as opposed to doing something like aligning with other teams retarded ideas. We did real awesome stuff and made sure we got recognized for that. I think the hard part for many people is the recognition that 80% of people (including maybe you) don't deserve a big bonus and promotion.<p>There will always be politics and politics will always drive these decisions, even in small companies. I don't have an effective way of objectively measuring a software engineer. The most important thing you can do is to pick a great manager (or startup CEO) and align yourself with him. While they will do different things to help you in big companies vs little companies, a good manager will hire good people and ensure that his team is working on big, company impacting problems. Startup CEOs will be doing the same thing.<p>Now a couple of notes to make sure your stack rank goes awesome:<p>1. If senior leadership does not see your team as directly impacting profit move to a new team.
2. Make sure that now that you are working on something with great business value make sure everyone knows about it.
3. Send out reports to everyone who is interested every week telling them what your team accomplished that week (especially for you budding managers out there).
4. Compile all the congratulatory emails from executives as well as other teams (Directors and managers). Your manager will use these at the stack rank meeting since all the other terrible managers who you no longer work for will not be this prepared.
5. Remember to deliver. When you deliver real value you will be recognized.<p>I know this is hard but I used this strategy very successfully. I can not emphasize enough that you must be working on big, impacting features. Adding a widget to a form, or making some little feature is a butts in seats problem. If you are just a butt in a seat expect to be treated like one.",1341344651

4195790,comment,4194372,4194372,16,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is pretty spot on. The process of reviews is one of the most corrosive elements of working at Microsoft. However, there's more to the story. MS fumbled a huge opportunity in the way they reacted to the financial crisis and recession. They put the vast majority of promotions and bonuses on hold. Keep in mind that this is a company that has tens of billions of dollars in cash on hand. More so, this is a company with an ""up or out"" philosophy baked into it (and that's a big reason for the review system). Due to fear and lack of leadership the company saved spending who knows how many millions of dollars and in the process drove away a lot of their best talent and lost out on hiring a lot of new talent as well. The way they went about layoffs didn't help either, with lots of little layoffs instead of one big purge and done (so that the remaining folks didn't have to question their job security every day). Instead of projecting strength they projected weakness, and they paid dearly for it.<p>But beyond all that it's the increasing culture of bureaucracy that's eaten away at MS. All the reorgs treating developers as nothing more than assembly line workers. All the incompetent middle managers and PMs that are 10x harder to get rid of than incompetent devs. All the silly out of order budget and management priorities. There's only so many times that an individual can pour their heart into a job and see nothing of substance come of it before they decide to move on to greener pastures.<p>The worst part of the whole thing is that few people realize the significant amount of lag between when a company starts falling down before it hits bottom. Losing a ton of talented devs probably won't stop you from shipping the current version of whatever is in the pipeline, or even the next version. It'll just mean a lot of projects that would have been conceived won't be, and it'll be harder to execute on a lot of projects that should have been a slam dunk. More so, being able to work with more talented devs is a big perk for other devs, which will tend to accelerate the exodus at all levels. And typically people will make up their mind to leave months or even years before they actually do. By the time it's actually supremely obvious that all the good talent has left it's far too late to do anything about it.",1341344129

Market share depends highly on geography, and it's much harder for a global company to ignore any of the major browsers.<p>Desktop map: <a href=""http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201206-201206-map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-201206-201206-...</a><p>Mobile map: <a href=""http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_browser-ww-monthly-201206-201206-map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_browser-ww-monthly-201206-...</a>",1341343740

In fact, when there is a lot of fat to trim, any policy that identifies non-contributors and enables them to move on is going to be beneficial to the company<p>4. Implementing a stack ranking policy for a long time I think would have negative consequences for morale. The goal is to fire people who are doing negative work and causing problems.

4195671,comment,4195115,4195529,15,0,dkokelley,,,"The artificial demand you mention is essentially speculation. The scalpers are betting that the actual price attendees are willing to pay is higher than the initial selling price, which leads them to buy the ticket. This system still requires players who ultimately purchase the tickets for the utility of seeing the show. If $100 tickets ultimately get sold for $2,000 to actual attendees, the original seller significantly underpriced their tickets. There was a full market of people willing to buy the tickets for $2,000 for the show. Scalpers didn't mess with this market or confuse demand. They made the market efficient. The fans who valued the show the most got the enjoyment utility of attending. This system primarily hurts the fans who couldn't afford the more expensive tickets. On the other hand, without a secondary market, the fans who valued the show the most are harmed.<p>The only way that scalpers can create artificial demand is if there are no attendees willing to pay the price scalpers want to charge. In that scenario, scalpers sell to other scalpers at higher and higher prices, and the last person (scalper) to buy loses. If the last scalper buys the ticket for $4,000 and there is no party willing to buy the ticket for at least that AND see the show, the scalper is left with two options - go to the show (which by definition for the scalper provides less utility than the ticket price warrants), or sell the ticket at a loss (or possibly for $0, if there are no buyers).<p>I think there is a good analogy to other forms of speculation, particularly in commodities. Speculators ""drive up"" the price of oil by buying and selling it for more and more, but as long as consumers are willing to pay for that oil, the price is justified, and the original sellers forfeited their potential profit.<p>Granted, oil and housing speculation can lead to bad things for the economy as a whole. Here I think the analogy fails, since tickets are inherently a temporary market with an expiration date. Without an expiration date you can have bubbles, and bubbles can burst.",1341342556

149928,comment,147710,149903,0,0,bumbledraven,,,"You are suggesting that there may be some aspect of humans which (a) can be observed by another un-augmented human over a low-bandwidth TTY and (b) can <i>never</i> -- at any point in the future -- be simulated by a computer, no matter how complicated the algorithm or how powerful the computer.<p>While I admit that this is <i>possible</i>, it strikes me as implausible for the following reason: the capabilities of computers are increasing as time goes by, while those of humans are not (the Flynn effect notwithstanding).<p>I could understand if you were to say that we won't have the technology to make computers that pass the Turing Test in the next <i>x</i> years, for a sufficiently large <i>x</i>. But you are suggesting that it is plausible that we will <i>never</i> do it, in the same sense that a physical object will never move faster than the speed of light. In the absence of a well-accepted theory supported by evidence (as we have for the limit of the speed of light), this strikes me as a very strong claim that is difficult to defend given the existence of technological evolution in the world.",1206856001

149921,comment,149708,149852,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Not quite true.  The banks which lent directly to hedge funds -- prime brokers -- were not depository institutions and, until last week, they couldn't borrow from the Fed.  These were institutions like Bear Stearns or Morgan Stanley.  Besides, even depository institutions are reluctant to borrow at the Fed's discount window.  Pretty much all bank borrowing is either through short term loans at LIBOR or overnight loans via the Fed funds system.  (Note that the Fed funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow from each other using the Fed's system, it is NOT the rate at which banks borrow from the Fed.  That's the discount rate.)<p>Regardless, it still makes plenty of economic sense for a bank to lend to a hedge fund, whether or not the Fed is involved.  This type of lending is typically short term and rolled over as loans expire.  If a bank lends to another bank, it only receives LIBOR, but if it lends to a hedge fund, it can charge slightly higher, say LIBOR + 40bps.  Given that the bank itself can borrow at LIBOR, this is a decent way to make money.  It's really no different than short-term lending to any other kind of corporation.<p>I won't deny that credit has greatly expanded lately.  I just don't think the expansion of credit to hedge funds has much to do with the Fed.",1206855572

149915,comment,148503,149691,0,0,dkokelley,,,"The demand is static for argument's sake.<p>The reason I believe it is valid to assume a static demand for demonstrative purposes is because I believe that the supply has shifted much more significantly than the demand has over the past 10 years or so, to the point that the change in demand is negligible.<p>This is just from first-hand observation. I don't have any evidence or reports to show this. It's only my hypothesis. If there are any reports showing a different supply/demand relationship please let me know.",1206854912

""What if consciousness is not an algorithm"" is just a special case of ""What if not everything about humans is computable"". That's the real point. Any grandiose claim about this seems to me laughably unsubstantiated. Yet there it is, giggling underneath the solemnity of the Singularians.<p>Edit: don't know about the rat project.

149903,comment,147710,149885,0,0,gruseom,,,"I'm not saying there <i>simply does not exist</i> such an algorithm; I don't have an opinion on that one way or the other. I'm questioning your claim that ""it would be <i>very hard</i> to argue that the singularity won't arrive eventually"" because ""eventually there <i>will be</i> machines that are capable of passing the Turing test"" (emphasis added). You don't know that. Nobody does. Some people like the idea, some people don't; it's wishful thinking on both sides.<p>My point was to offer one possible scenario under which computers might <i>not</i> pass the Turing test: namely, if there turns out to be some essential aspect of humans (capable of being observed through a low-bandwidth TTY, if you insist) that can't be captured algorithmically. Consciousness <i>might</i> be one such feature. (It's a reasonable one to suggest for two reasons: it's central to human existence and no one has a clue what it is.)<p>""We'll just simulate it, then"" is, in my view, a dodge. If there isn't an algorithm for X, why should there necessarily be one that approximates X arbitrarily closely?<p>Partisans of the ""singularity"" are fond of insisting that it's all a matter of processing power, but that's only true  <i>if there's an algorithm for everything</i>. That blithe assumption seems to me an article of faith. It reminds me of G.K. Chesterton's line, ""Give us one free miracle and we'll explain everything.""",1206853504

For example, I have yet to see any evidence that they depreciate any faster than a major household appliance.<p>I also disagree that there is, necessarily, such a thing a ""initial depreciation."" The big hits up front are sales taxes and agreeing to a price higher than the value. The former is an issue for used cars, too, as is the latter, though, perhaps, to a lesser extent, considering high-margin add-ons new car dealers try to sell.<p>The spread between price and value may be even more with a used car. Specifically, with a new car, one has at least something of a lower bound for value. With a used car, the value could well be 0, though, with well published price information, one tends to have an upper bound for price.<p>The other important aspect seems to be risk. With a new car, while it is under warranty, one has paid to avoid the risk of a sudden, expensive, mechanical failure. What I like to remind my friends is that, though this may well be the case, one is never compensated for time or inconvenience if there is a failure.<p>With a used car, although the operating costs over the short term may be unpredictable, over the long term, it evens out. More importantly, if one chooses a reliable manufacturer, the overall risk of breakdown can be adjusted very close to zero with adequate preventative measures.<p>All that said, I, too, am against the Clunkers program for basic economic reasons: it encourages the wanton destruction of wealth.",1251331175

788336,comment,788016,788242,0,0,beninato,,,"Hi Jack,<p>Great question. It's pretty complicated, but I think naming a valuation can only lead to problems. Bottom line: it's not your job as an entrepreneur to value your company. It's up to the investor to ""make the offer"" in most cases. Angels and VCs are professional negotiators. Most entrepreneurs are not. They see thousands of companies every year and can very quickly assess the value of your company. I have seen situations where an entrepreneur shoots himself in the foot by stating a valuation that is lower than the VC had in mind, as you suggest above. But the reality is that the ""market"" will value your startup. If 3 VCs want to fund it, it's probably worth more than you thought. If 0 VCs want to fund it, it's probably worth less than you thought :( I think it's best to let the investors compete and the interest level drive the valuation of the company. If asked for a valuation by a potential investor, my suggestion to entrepreneurs is to say ""We'd like to raise $X. We're realistic about valuations these days, so you don't need to worry that we want $20 pre. But we're going to let the market decide the valuation."" Most investors respect that response from what I have experienced over the years.",1251330216

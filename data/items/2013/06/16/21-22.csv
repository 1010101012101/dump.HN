Right now I am noticing basically two groups of people (not correlated to age): one group which enjoys the effects, 3D, epicness... and the other which is disillusioned with today&#x27;s movies (ie yay another movie where I watch CGI dudes shoot around and then get a 3D fly-over the battle-field every 5 seconds).<p>I think there is something to be said for the funneling of movie budgets into a few MASSIVELY costing movies (ie per the Spielberg interview that was posted on HN last week). I, myself, enjoy a good &quot;Dark Knight&quot;, but also something like the King&#x27;s Speech or The Tree of Life. The question is whether both can keep being made for their respective budgets, and both in film vs other media.",1371419986

Whether I was making $50k/year or $100k/year, I wasn&#x27;t saving anything more besides the shit I was contributing to my 401k.  My savings actually grew smaller over the years, until I made a conscious effort to save money.  An effort so simple, I kick myself for not realizing it sooner.<p>Several simple ways I found to save money living in NYC (not SF, but close enough).  Note these figures are on a per-year basis.<p><pre><code>  - Scrap web hosting, move to AWS and S3 (~120 saved)\n  - Get rid of cable, stick with cheap Internet (~1000 saved, Internet ~40/mo)\n  - One night less at the bar each week (~2500 saved, that&#x27;s just for a $40 tab)\n  - Skip buying coffee every day (~500 saved)\n  - Get a cheaper phone package (~120 saved)\n</code></pre>\nIn the end, I think a good rule of thumb is to keep your daily expenses under $20.  You want to dress well?  Wait for Banana Republic to have a 40% off everything sale, and buy clothes then.  Buy clothes you&#x27;re actually going to wear more than once (this is easy for guys, women have it harder).<p>I don&#x27;t know your lifestyle or actually care what you spend money on, but complaining you can&#x27;t save money is a bullshit excuse.

5890159,comment,5889357,5889357,3,0,Tomdarkness,,,"&quot;Or are you dual-booting it on your hand-built gaming rig?&quot;<p>Actually I am. Despite the fact you can get hardware (motherboards, RAM, drives, etc.) from many different manufacturers the &quot;core&quot; hardware pretty much follows a set of strict standards. Ever since Apple moved to Intel CPU based hardware they also made OS X compatible with those same standards (AHCI, ACPI, etc.). Sure, you might have the odd issue with certain configurations but in general modern Intel based desktop PCs are fairly straightforward to run OS X on.<p>The same applies for the Linux Kernel, except it supports far more standards and architectures then OS X.<p>But anyway I suppose my point is that the OS will pretty much run in most cases. However, your non-standard additional hardware (wireless adapters, your funky magic PCIe card, etc.) that requires drivers is not really because Linux, Windows or OS X does not support that hardware but rather the manufacturer of said devices choice not to support that OS. Don&#x27;t complain that Linux or whatever does not support your hardware but rather complain that the manufacturer chose not to support Linux or use some kind of common standard.<p>Sure, common hardware or hardware that follows a standard might have a driver written by Microsoft or the linux kernel devs but most of the time the driver is written by those who created the hardware. For example it would be silly to blame Microsoft saying Windows does not support a Nvidia graphics card if Nvidia never released Windows drivers for that card. Likewise it would be silly to blame Apple if I bought some TV tuner, or similar PCI(e) card, and found it did not work in my Mac Pro.",1371419298

Further, let&#x27;s imagine that Linux supported my current setup perfectly.<p>My setup won&#x27;t be my setup forever.  Maybe some new hardware comes out and I want to experiment with it.  Will it work with Linux?  Will the person making that hardware have Linux in mind when they&#x27;re building it?  If my current hardware breaks, will it be easy for me to find suitable replacement quickly?  As in same-day quickly?<p>Is memorizing the list of &quot;professional-grade&quot; hardware that works with Linux -- or perhaps just the list of exceptions if that&#x27;s the smaller list -- worth my time as a professional?<p>For you, the answer to all these questions might be &quot;yes&quot; or even &quot;yes, given how much I care about using Linux for other reasons.&quot;  That&#x27;s great.<p>However, the mere fact that one has to consider these questions increases the cost of adoption.  It shouldn&#x27;t therefore be a surprise that fewer people use the platform as a result or that people point out this frustrates them.  Maybe they even use tricky phrases like &quot;hardware support&quot; which can mean many things to many people to describe their frustration.<p>If you want to think about it algorithmically, maybe try this picture.  You have two points A and B on a map with varied terrain and a path-finding algorithm.  You have N seconds to get from A to B, including the amount of time it takes to find a path.<p>You won&#x27;t be able to take fastest path if it takes longer than N seconds to find that path -- by that point you&#x27;ll be out of time.  Instead, the nave solution would be to take the first path P where the time searching for P plus the time to traverse P is <= N, assuming you can find one.  Maybe you modify this meta-algorithm slightly so that once you find a P, if the time spent so far plus the time to traverse P is M < N you spend another N - M seconds looking for a second, possibly-shorter path.<p>Those &quot;N - M&quot; seconds are really important in consumer psychology.  If you&#x27;ve found multiple options and weighed them you&#x27;ll feel much more comfortable in your decision.  That comfort translates into confidence in the underlying platform.<p>On Linux the &quot;time searching for P&quot; is much larger than OS X, but the original article is pretending as if it&#x27;s only the existence of a fast-enough path that matters.  It&#x27;s not, especially if the time to find the right path dwarfs the amount of time you have to spend on the problem or it results in you being able to weigh as many options as you would on another platform.<p>For me, personally, as someone who values his own attention very, very highly, my threshold for &quot;time spent searching for P&quot; is incredibly low.",1371418769

Basically Angular does dirty checking to keep track of changes while Ember knows of your changes because you are using get() and set()(1).<p>In my opinion this sucks. I love being able to use plain old javascript objects in Angular. Not having to extend every object with ember.observable is a big win for me. When O.o lands Angular will be just as fast (if not faster) as Ember but without the need to instantiate new Ember objects, and always use get() and set() on them.<p>Of course Ember could change its API in the future, but Angular won&#x27;t need an API change because its already using plain old javascript objects.<p>1: <a href=""http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Observable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Observable.html</a>",1371417265

Many families are also in the suburbs (South Bay or East Bay) as the weather tends to be better and you can have houses with gardens for the kids to play around (also the school system is less messed up there).\nWhich does not mean that there are not kids-full neighborhoods in the city.",1371416488

I&#x27;d say work on finding a way to articulate your value proposition well enough so that you can convert customers at a high enough rate compared to what your competitors are making.<p>Don&#x27;t try to service these customers at first and just hand whomever makes it through over to another party (taking a few percent in reseller fees.)<p>It seems like you have a small nugget of a value proposition hidden in your site, which seems to be people who are looking for truly high-performance bare metal servers to rent on demand.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that for that specific niche a few people/companies can make decent money by having the best combination of SEO/SEM and well converting marketing copy.<p>If you want to get this company off the ground you&#x27;ll have to become one of those few people and consistently beat the few other players bound to be trying to dominate this market.<p>Testing all this costs almost nothing apart from a few dollars here and there to help test your new design/copy a bit faster.<p>That is what you&#x27;d need to make a successful business out of this. If that doesn&#x27;t sound like fun to you you&#x27;re probably interested in something else right now and perhaps you should focus your activities around being able to work on the things that interest you...",1371416486

6649195,comment,6642893,6646608,2,0,nostrademons,,,"Iframes have a couple advantages over XHR:<p>1. You can do progressive rendering with an iframe.  With an XHR you don&#x27;t get the &#x27;loaded&#x27; callback until the entire response has arrived, and so you can&#x27;t start working with and manipulating the data until it&#x27;s all there.  With an iframe you can put successive chunks in <script> tags and they will start executing as soon as the closing tag for the script is found.  Or if you want to transport the data as HTML, you can put a 0-length animation on each element that forms a response chunk, and listen for the animationend event to get notified as soon as it&#x27;s ready in the DOM.<p>2. You can measure and manipulate elements while they&#x27;re still in the iframe.  For example, if you&#x27;re animating the rest of your layout, you can measure the size of the elements that you just loaded inside a hidden iframe, adjust transitions on the main page to make space for them, and then pop the elements from the iframe into their proper places in the final layout.  With an XHR, the only way to measure the element is to place it into the DOM and force a layout, which is much slower, particularly on mobile devices.<p>3. Iframes form a layout boundary, so when the browser lays out elements in them it stops the layout process at the iframe.  This eliminates the need to do a CPU-intensive layout of the whole page when you pop in your XHR content.",1383247060

Make it trivially easy for them to find the information they want, quickly. Use a clean structure, clear sections and sub-sections, and consistent formatting.  Two pages absolute maximum.<p>* Tailor your CV to the specific job that you&#x27;re applying for.  For example, if you&#x27;re applying for a web development job then put your web development experience at the top.<p>* Pay attention to detail. Be consistent in your use of punctuation and capitalisation. Ensure that there are no spelling errors.<p>* Use LaTeX (there are some great CV templates available) and send your CV in PDF.  Microsoft Word documents invariably look messy when you open them in Word. It&#x27;s much better to send the &quot;final&quot; output.<p>* Emphasise specific skill areas (e.g. software development, system administration, domain-specific knowledge) and list my skills in each area. This makes it easy for the reader to immediately identify what I can do, they don&#x27;t have to read through descriptions of my previous jobs.<p>* Be concise and straight to the point. Don&#x27;t use personal pronouns.  Keep descriptions compact.<p>* In the cover letter list three specific ways in which you can contribute specifically to the company to the company you are applying to. Show, exactly, how your profile matches key points in the job description. Don&#x27;t talk about how great you are or what you want from them.<p>The goal of the cover letter/email is to get people to read your CV. The goal of the CV is to get an interview. The goal of the interview is to check you&#x27;re a good fit for the job and get the job if you are. Therefore, your CV should encourage the reader to want to interview you. Don&#x27;t bore them with exhaustive descriptions of what you have done. Less is more. Instead, focus on the highlights and entice them to invite you to interview to find out more.<p>Finally, if you do get rejected, always politely ask why.  You won&#x27;t always get an answer, but the answers you do get are often enlightening, often not what you expect, and will help you immensely with future applications.",1383247048

There isn&#x27;t really a good track-changes implementation either - not something you could use to discuss whether changes are good.<p>- You can do some styling, but again it comes across as not really practical for continual extensive use.  Word doesn&#x27;t do a brilliant job of keeping themes/styles consistent throughout the document, but google docs doesn&#x27;t even try.

You&#x27;d think with their unrivalled big-data text analysis capabilities gdocs would have best-of-the-best spelling/grammar checkers, but they&#x27;re just basic.  The editor view enforces a paged layout, even if you&#x27;re not writing pages (and when you are, it&#x27;s not necessarily good for productivity to have it so in your face the whole time).  It&#x27;s html-based, but html export is rudimentary, and css support essentially absent.<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t think Gdocs has limited takeup due to poor document interop, I think it has poor takeup because it&#x27;s just not a very good rich text editor.

A recruiter or manager is going to get hundreds of the damn things, they&#x27;re only going to look at your CV for 10-15 seconds. You&#x27;ve got to make it easy for them to pick out the right things as fast as possible. People aren&#x27;t going to fight through something that&#x27;s hard to read or that uses a lot of marketing.<p>The way I think of it is that your resume is for concisely listing your accomplishments in a structured format. One page. Only. Chances are no-one&#x27;s gonna read more than that.<p>Top of the page - centred, bold: Your name.<p>Address, mobile, email - one line, centred, not bold - may need to put it in a smaller font size, don&#x27;t go beneath 10. (Make sure you&#x27;ve got a professional voicemail message.)<p>Underneath that, what you&#x27;ve done. Stick things in reverse chronological order. Give each role the title of the job, the date it started with, a prose paragraph of responsibilities, bullet-pointed accomplishments. Keep your bullet points on one line. Treat your education like a job. If it&#x27;s the most recent thing you&#x27;ve done, list your university stuff first.<p>Company I&#x27;d do it like this:
Oct 2007 - Present, Job Role, Company Name.<p>Uni I&#x27;d do it like this:
BSC Computer Science, University of Whatever, Oct 2007 - Present<p>Underline and bold the roles so that people can see just from casting their eye over it what you&#x27;ve done. Only underline and bold the roles like this - gives people something consistent. If you&#x27;ve got unpaid work, list it the same as any other role.<p>For the responsibilities paragraph, for example for uni, you&#x27;d be saying what you studied, that sort of thing.<p>(If you&#x27;ve been working for a couple of years, then your university should just be a line at the base of the CV. Remember to track your metrics as move on out into the working world by the way - if you can hang a number off of something that&#x27;s often good. If you worked in a bar how many customers did you do a night? Numbers make things more concrete.)<p>For achievement bullet-points you want what you achieved (numbers again - preferably) and how you did it. Concisely. Don&#x27;t worry if your accomplishments or achievements are small - list them anyway. You&#x27;re not being compared to people who are working for five years. Don&#x27;t be afraid to say something like you&#x27;ve worked in a bar, some work is better than no work at all. If you&#x27;ve been given more responsibilities, mention them! No matter how small. It shows good character.<p>Try to stay away from just listing responsibilities here - just don&#x27;t, please don&#x27;t, put them as bullet-points - that makes you look like you&#x27;ve just done what you had to. If you&#x27;ve done a job poorly, you won&#x27;t have achievements to list and that&#x27;s what it looks like - like you&#x27;re trying to pass off responsibilities as achievements because you&#x27;ve not done anything.<p>Don&#x27;t include your interests. The odds of connecting with a recruiter are low, or it&#x27;s something that everyone&#x27;s done and thus doesn&#x27;t yield an advantage. Space is limited, just don&#x27;t do it.<p>#<p>I wouldn&#x27;t worry too much about just losing one or two of your first applications, by the way.

6649065,comment,6647809,6647809,2,0,goggles99,,,"There is a big fallacy with the reasoning behind this article. I grew up in impoverished areas (both the inner city, and in rural areas) with the typical high minority population. I have observed a LOT of poor people and their spending habits. Here are my thoughts.<p>(I am not disputing the claim of the author&#x27;s story and that experience, I am merely pointing out that his example is not the case most of the time.)<p>It is true that a very small minority of people dress and talk nicely because they realize that they will be treated better by the middle and upper class. Now in this group, some spend lavish amounts of money (like in the article), and some shop at thrift stores and/or buy knock off designer purses, belts, ETC. This fact alone blurs the argument that the author is presenting. It is very possible (and proven so) to live in poverty in America and dress well by choosing alternative resources.<p>The other (and more devastating) counter argument that applies to other poor people is merely by observation of what the status symbols that many in these groups purchase.<p>Let me use the example that was laid out in the article. The typical poor black women/man in a white world scenario. Well then why do the majority of poor black men and women who make expensive status symbol purchases look ghetto and drive &quot;ghetto&quot; cars? I don&#x27;t mean beat up and worn out clothes and cars, I mean the style of clothing/jewelry and pimped out cars. These same people aren&#x27;t talking &quot;nicely&quot; either. Their heavy use of Ebonics/Redneck/Slang and constant expletives while wearing their gold chains, starter athletic jerseys and Le-Brons (expensive basketball shoes) ETC. Tell a different story. They are seeking status among their piers, not the middle/upper class that they envy. They are not doing it to help them work their way up economically. It is in fact keeping them down. How are they better off overall now? They could have saved that money and invested it on going to school or moving to an area of better geographic opportunity. Now instead they just look like more expensively dressed thugs.<p>My personal belief is that most poor people live for today. They don&#x27;t have long term goals and plans. They were never taught good habits like saving up money and conveying to the non-minority class that they don&#x27;t have a ghetto mentality or live in the rap/hip hop culture (during job interviews ETC).<p>They have no hope, because they have no vision or dreams. All that they typically  observe is their small world and the twisted fantasy of  television/movies/commercials. Sure, it feels great to go into a department store and feel wealthy for a day, wear expensive things and feel better about yourself, but most poor people buying designer status symbols - this is what it is really all about. Living a fantasy with no real benefit to their actual social, economic, or productive member of society status.",1383246257

But it&#x27;s probably better to assume there&#x27;s a good faith basis in the submission of this article, since we&#x27;ve no reason to believe otherwise. You&#x27;re very right that Berlin in recent years has been aggressively pushing itself as the next Valley (and I guess to some extent it is succeeding -- you&#x27;re seeing a few big players emerge from there, Soundcloud being one that everyone knows about).<p>The reason why it&#x27;ll never be the next full-on Valley though, in my opinion (as another poster has already mentioned) is the racism there. As a brown guy who&#x27;s been to a lot of places, let me tell you that there is racism basically everywhere but in America (and Canada). It is of a particularly sharp type in Berlin (and the rest of East Germany). It really puts a burden on you mentally when you have to make everyday life decisions (should I take the train at this time? alone? at $X place?) in efforts of just escaping harassment. For as much as I rail on America for the eroding civil liberties and all, I can not imagine leaving this place for any other.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fwd.us/our_supporters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fwd.us/our_supporters</a>",1383246171

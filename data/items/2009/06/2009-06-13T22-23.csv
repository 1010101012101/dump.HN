656594,comment,656369,656590,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"Thanks. Your #1 and #2 seem to be very common.<p>It looks like we're at a point now where many dynamic languages are attempting to transition to a more advanced VM. This includes Perl, Python, Ruby, and some implementations of JavaScript. I assume they all want to take advantage of the latest VM techniques, and they're all making major changes anyway, so again I just wonder why they don't seriously consider collaborating now.",1244933816

When the language was developed, no suitable common VM existed<p>3. The language developers thought they could do it better for their specific case, i.e. the point of the implementation is to showcase new VM strategies<p>Remember that a language and an interpreter are separate things, and usually an author who wants to try an idea for one has to find some suitable stand-in for the other in order to get started.",1244933459
656589,comment,656369,656546,0,0,CUViper,,,"One perl nicety is that the VM will optimize to only compile the expression once.  Python's re.sub() has to compile the expression every time, since it's just a string argument rather than a language construct.  You can manually cache the result of re.compile() -- it's just not as sugary that way.",1244933232

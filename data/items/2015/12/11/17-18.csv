Buying a business is not an easy task.<p>Before anything else, I would sit down with all the employees (together and separately) and hear from them what are the problems in the business and what they think should be the priority.<p>This will have 2 affects.<p>1. They will respect you for giving them a voice.\n2. You will get smarter by the minute on what the business needs.<p>After that, before anything else I would just set up systems in place, processes and systems are super important when you run a time and materials business.<p>Understanding the cost and getting the cost of goods and labor down would be my first priority.

However, that is only because I think the entire scheme is novel for any business, again what other industry see employees/contractors fined/arrested for doing their job? Ultimately the fact that Uber provides and pays for lawyers to represent Uber drivers will pop its head up in the courts, and it would not surprise me if this fact becomes a new element/factor the courts weight in determining the employee/contractor issue.

The Amiga sold better in Europe than comparable consoles like the SNES, Genesis, etc.  I compare it to consoles because that really is what the Amiga offered to most folks - console quality games in the guise of a computer. Disks (lots of disks) versus cartridges. And some hand-wavy productivity stuff, like the C64 did (it&#x27;s OK mom, this is a computer and will make Jonny better at school!), that a few folks used.<p>2) Antiquated video toaster tinkerers and hardware geeks. These folks like to play with hardware, especially antiquated hardware, and see how far they can push it for the novelty of it all.<p>3) Old Amiga OSes vs Amiga OS 4+. I think Amiga 4 is really for the folks who want to turn the brand into something usable and modern, but in all honesty, I think Amiga - if it were to ever rise from the ashes - would need a complete reboot much like OS X was compared to OS 9 and earlier. OS X was a total rework, and allowed some backwards compatibility for a little while but ultimately divorced itself from the old days. This is the only way it could ever succeed. Amiga (and, ultimately, Commodore) will always be thought of fondly by past customers, but to get a new market Amiga/Commodore would need to reboot. That&#x27;s my opinion, anyway. And focus on innovation. The brands are currently zombie brands, owned by various firms that simply license the logos to any Tom, Dick and Harry that want to slap it on a Chinese mobile phone, toaster, teapot, whatever. Those days would have to stop.<p>I personally started in bucket #2 above. I own a never used/never sold Amiga 1200. And as soon as I got it, I cracked it open and installed an accelerator board (they are easily purchased from Amigakit in England) that pushed its RAM from 2MB up to a whopping 9MB. I also installed a 4GB compact flash hard drive (the original never-used hard drive was a dead brick, naturally). As a result, I can load virtually anything I want onto the machine and use it relatively quickly (see bucket 1). Currently I&#x27;m on Level 3 of Eye of the Beholder. :) Yes, I deal with PAL vs NTSC issues at times, among other things, but overall it&#x27;s a pretty nifty setup. Next year I plan to get it on my Wi-Fi - because.<p>So, from a hobbyist standpoint, it&#x27;s quite  a lot of fun. And it&#x27;s vastly more enjoyable than an emulator. But it&#x27;s not for everyone. And my pipe dream about a renewed Amiga/Commodore brand is really, frankly, never going to happen. If a company could create a vision like I described, they wouldn&#x27;t anchor it to a dead zombie brand (that I love).",1449856461

In reality, the gig economy is a feature of late capitalism&#x27;s final race to the bottom wherein information technology has enabled businesses to access previously untapped small private capital (cars or whatever else) to be utilized by the owners as an adjunct/prerequisite to selling their labor.<p>Thus, the small private capital is requisitioned at large scale for the purposes of the large capital business owner, allowing them to avoid paying the cost of actually onboarding and maintaining the small capital purchases. The labor bought by the business owner is expendable and limitless, thanks to information technology; the entire venture is only possible by trading a pittance of labor costs and getting both steady labor and the use of small capital items in return.<p>The gig economy allows the rich to take value from the small amounts of capital that are readily and equally distributed among the working class in the form of their cars or whatever else. Paying for the labor and getting both labor and capital is brilliant, but people don&#x27;t realize that they&#x27;re consenting to an economic situation that looks a lot like robbery.",1449856325

Instead, I condemn very specific emotional states resulting in very specific kinds of behavior -- ones which are specifically recognized as being uncivil and inherently intellectually dishonest. (And if you think otherwise, please provide quotes and justification. As I&#x27;ve noted elsewhere, you have this habit of assuming falsehoods about me and writing them in this thread, and never acknowledging them when called out.)<p>My understanding of your objection is this: Either you are embarrassed because you do these things, or you feel that I have concocted the above construction to purposely tar certain (unspecified) groups in a dishonest way. Please note that in your comments, you apparently jumped to conclusions about my political views. Can you provide quotes (relevant) which say what they are? (You&#x27;ll be able to do this somewhat with sibling quotes, but this doesn&#x27;t logically help you in terms of demonstrating you did not jump to such conclusions.) My objections are to particular psychological states and succumbing to the resulting cognitive distortions. You then proceeded to provide a demonstration of precisely these phenomena! Thank you!<p><i>I haven&#x27;t thought my posts were toxic because they get good replies and they don&#x27;t get downvote-hidden.</i><p>Strange, but some of your longest posts were very clearly downvote-greyed, particularly the most salient one referenced in this thread. This seems counter-factual.<p>Another falsehood of yours: You stated that I discount emotion. This is another clear example of your jumping to conclusions. Emotion cannot act as an &quot;oracle&quot; but nowhere do I state that it is worthless.<p>Let&#x27;s break this down simply. I spoke out against (unspecified) misguided words and actions in the name of &quot;activism&quot; which are motivated by anger and outrage. I say that the same psychological mechanisms that are involved in out-grouping and hate are involved. You then produced a very long post trying to justify (unspecified) words and actions through the magnitude of crimes of oppressors, and apparently did this in a way many interpreted as a personal attack against me. (Then edited, apparently)<p>I would ask this -- what psychological state are you in, where you can have such a strong reaction to a opinion about <i>unspecified</i> words and actions? What psychological state are you in, where you keep on jumping to conclusions, writing falsehoods, then fail to acknowledge them?<p>Is it correct to say that you are attempting to defend and justify some prior words and actions of yours which were guided by outrage? Are you defending intellectual dishonesty, stereotyping, and emotional bullying done in the name of a cause? I sincerely hope you are, because in doing so, you have done much for my own cause. (Which is politically neutral and specifically against a particular group-psychological phenomenon.)",1449855913

I started to wonder what would happen if you made the ultimate cross between Entertainment and Philanthropy.  Wrap it up as a video game you can give to a teenager in the first world, to try to teach them some empathy.  I tried to describe what it&#x27;s like to play this game, as if one teenager was explaining it to another teenager.<p>...<p>&quot;Save A Kid&quot;<p>It costs $100 to buy the game, and it&#x27;s $15 per month to play.<p>When you pick a character, you get to pick a Country of origin, and then an age and a sex. Then you get to start customizing, by looking for a character that has a given race or religion, if you care about that. For newbies, I&#x27;d definitely recommend picking a character that speaks a language you can speak fluently. And if you&#x27;re an Expert, you can play a character that has different Disadvantages. It doesn&#x27;t give you any bonus attributes, but you get bragging rights for playing one of them well. There&#x27;s like, Orphan and Kid-With-AIDS, and then there are harder ones like &quot;Scarred by War&quot; where the kids have missing limbs, etc. Anyway, newbies should probably avoid those at first.<p>So, anyway, it&#x27;s kind of like The Sims, or a Tamagotchi, or Farm Town, or something.<p>You log on every day, and depending on the character you picked, you either get an email, or maybe a voice mail or a video mail. The character tells you about how much it appreciates the new computer (<a href=""http://latptop.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latptop.org</a>) and the food (<a href=""https://www.fmsc.org/home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fmsc.org/home</a>). The first couple levels, it&#x27;s all about gaining Health Points. You can totally nerf your character by spending some of your monthly allotment of extra gold points on buffing the kid&#x27;s parents (<a href=""http://www.kiva.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kiva.org/</a>), if he has them. The parents start generating more gold points on their own, which makes it a lot easier to play. Some people even buy buffs online (<a href=""http://www.heifer.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heifer.org/</a>), which I think is cheating, but for a newbie, it&#x27;s an easy way to keep your kid alive.<p>Anyway, you and your friends can make a clan, and all play characters in the same village. I&#x27;ve even heard that some really crazy rich players can buy buffs for the whole village, like a potable water and electricity system (fora.tv/2008/07/03/Dean_Kamen_on_Potable_Water_and_Sustainable_Electricity).<p>There are Events in the game, where like the country the kid is in goes into War. That sucks, because sometimes you lose your character, and the game is perma-death, which is lame. They do a really good job making the game realistic, because sometimes you even see in the news that the real country is in war. Most of the time, they just make stuff up though, because most of the wars never show up on TV, but your character won&#x27;t shut up about them.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s a sandbox game, which some people don&#x27;t like. But the AI is incredible. Your character will like ask you how they can keep their food from spoiling, and if you look it up online (<a href=""https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/mohammed-bah-abba"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ashoka.org/fellow/mohammed-bah-abba</a>), and explain to them how to do it, they can save some of their food. Or like, how they can build a windmill from scrap metal (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kamkwamba"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kamkwamba</a>).<p>Anyway, you play the same character as long as you want to, but most people get bored after the kid has a job and their own family, and they start over at level one. Restarting costs another $100 though.<p>The game developers say if too many people play the game, they might even run out of characters to play. I don&#x27;t buy it.

10718419,comment,10715161,10717667,0,0,n0us,,,"Well, the &quot;virus is alive&quot; thing is more of a toy example, a real example (which actually happened) that pertains to biology might be that of cigarettes causing lung cancer. There were extensive studies done to prove the statistical link between smoking and lung cancer but in the end we do not find a one to one correlation. Some smokers will go their entire lives and not get cancer, other people will never smoke and get lung cancer (although that number is very small). It can be obviously established that smoking is statistically linked to getting cancer, but the burden for claiming that smoking &quot;causes&quot; lung cancer is somewhat higher. Since scientists at the time could not account for why some smokers develop lung cancer and others do not it becomes question of epistemology, the branch of Philosophy that deals with knowledge. How can we really know that lung cancer &quot;causes&quot; cancer or if it is simply a side effect of something intermediate caused by smoking or closely associated with it. The other alternative is that smoking is like playing roulette. In that case it also seems inappropriate to say that smoking &quot;causes&quot; cancer and instead it causes one to have an increased risk. (I don&#x27;t know if more research has been done on why some people develop cancer and others don&#x27;t.) Causation is an extremely thorny subject but in this case (iirc) it was one of the first times that a phenomenon was accepted as being a cause when there was not a one to one direct correlation with its effect.<p>As for the tree in the woods, again this is a toy example. It&#x27;s a vastly simplified example that philosophers use to discuss epistemology because it provides a simple basis on which to argue about something. In math and engineering they use the spherical cow in a friction-less world. Obviously no one cares about a spherical cow but it&#x27;s useful as an isolation tool so that you can really work on just the problem at hand.<p>I don&#x27;t know a lot about string theory but if it cannot be tested and is still considered science this is indeed very troublesome for many theories of science. Perhaps this ties into the realism / anti-realism debate where philosophers debate whether there are actually strings or they are just convenient mathematical constructs with wide explanatory power. I personally am somewhat of a nihilist on this point and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate to bend the concept of reality to apply to things like strings and that this is basically just an incoherent exercise to begin with.<p>A non-string example of this debate that I know a little bit more about (but not much) is the debate over observability. I can observe the wall in front of me unaided with my own eyes and sense of touch.<p>We can also &quot;observe&quot; radioactive decay in a gas chamber by examining the condensation trails of particles traveling through the gas, but are we really observing them? This seems to be more indirect than the first example, so can we really know that there are particles traveling through the gas? If indirect evidence is not acceptable in science, what is the cutoff point that it becomes unacceptable. I could hear from a friend of a friend of a friend that they saw bigfoot and while everyone might trust everyone else this most certainly is not a scientific observation. This latter example is extreme but it demonstrates the importance that scientists understand the scientific method and the philosophy behind it.<p>If string theory can only be proven indirectly, at what level of indirection does it become inappropriate to say that the observations are evidence for the theory. It sounds as if we only have very indirect evidence for string theory which is probably why it is so controversial.",1449855205

It&#x27;s frankly not true that the Bible condones slavery. When certain portions of the Bible describe slavery, it was more of a form of indentured servitude than the abomination we tend to think of.<p>I know that you can justify just about anything with the bible. Figuring out a justification for a given conclusion is not a reliable path to truth.<p>> For various reasons, people would put themselves into lifelong work contracts.<p>Which isn&#x27;t moral either, and which doesn&#x27;t change that the bible also condones slavery.<p>> The Mosaic Law has very progressive laws (at the time) for how masters were to treat their servants.<p>Yeah, god was very progressive for the time he lives outside of ... or whatever it is that you believe. Seriously, I have heard it all, and I have heard other people justify the opposite using the same book and just as broken logic.<p>> In fact, the Mosaic Law specifically condemns forced slavery, under the penalty of death (c).\n> \n> The Bible does encourage the forgiveness of debts (d), and in this context, masters releasing their indentured servants from their contracts was considered a part of this. The entire book of Philemon was basically about this.<p>See above.<p>> Anyway, the American abolitionist movement absolutely had Christian underpinnings, as did the British equivalent (read up on Wilberforce).<p>As did the supporters of slavery.<p>> At a minimum, there are many modern and historical black ministers, like Theodore S. Wright and Dr. King, that would disagree with the idea that Bible says slavery is OK. That sort of thing clearly violates both the golden rule and the idea of imago dei.<p>Yeah, just as supporters of slavery would agree very much, because <other reason from the bible>.<p>> Finally, black-market slavery is still a concern, especially sexual slavery. I don&#x27;t see much in the press about this sort of thing, but I haven&#x27;t been to a church in the last ten years that didn&#x27;t make fighting it a special focus in its ministry (e).<p>Yeah, and it&#x27;s great when churches to good deeds. But that neither justifies any supernatural claims nor does it depend on holding beliefs without evidence. The same people could just forget about the god stuff and continue doing good deeds, and often better deeds, as evidenced by lots of non-religious charities.<p>> 2. Causing harm with the intention of doing good.\n> \n> I absolutely think Christians do this. When this happens, they need to listen and be humble enough to ask for forgiveness and change their ways. The greatest two commandments are to love God completely and to love others as we love ourselves (f). If we&#x27;re not willing to stop harming and start helping people, we&#x27;re breaking the second most important commandment directly and the first most important commandment through disobedience.<p>You avoided the question.<p>> You probably see people (in shallow understanding of scripture, IMO) justify themselves with Bible verses when people are hurt. This is not Biblical. In fact, the harshest things Jesus said were to religious hyprocrites (g). Jesus has been, and still is, extremely counter-cultural. And religion, in the Bible, is all about charity and doing the right thing (h).<p>Yes, I still know that you can justify just about anything using the bible. It&#x27;s great if you justify good things using the bible. It&#x27;s just risky to use the bible as a source of justification, given how many bad things people have justified using it without realizing how bad it was, so chances are it could happen to you as well.<p>> Anyway, I see many, many more Christians deciding to sacrifice their time, money, and energy to help people than I see harm. It&#x27;s hard to put to fine a point on the hypothetical premise, though.<p>Yes, they decide to. But do they actually help, or do they just decide to help, and then end up causing harm?<p>And if they do actually help (and I agree, many certainly do), that&#x27;s great, of course, but, see above, doesn&#x27;t need the bible or belief without evidence.<p>> 3. ...if your religion keeps you from having real social contacts, I would urge you to change that, it&#x27;s probably not good for you in the long run.\n> \n> Yes. I agree. The Bible is fundamentally about relationships, so a Christian faith with no relationships is incomplete at best.\n> \n> I actually have much better friendships and my relationships with my family are also better now that I take the teaching in the Bible seriously. With salvation and assurance of a meaningful future, I don&#x27;t have to worry about myself (i) (j), so I can focus on others&#x27; needs, whether they&#x27;re physical, emotional, spiritual, or relational.<p>Except this assurance is actually worthless, so it&#x27;s risky if you stop worrying about yourself because of that worthless promise.<p>Nevertheless, great to hear you have great relationships with real people, those do actually provide a certain assurance of a meaningful future.<p>> I have never seen someone with worse relationships because of their obedience in the Bible. I have seen people oppressed, mocked, and attacked for their faith and insistence on doing what is right. That&#x27;s what I was talking about. Sorry if that was not clear.<p>Well, you are aware that there are churches that isolate their members from outside society, right? And that they justify that using the bible (or whatever, possibly related, holy book they are using)? And not only small ones either.<p>> 4. ...unlike real people, god does not actually exist, and you cannot expect anything tangible from god if you need help.... Other people will largely honor your loyalty with their support for you, god won&#x27;t.\n> \n> It shouldn&#x27;t shock you that the Bible teaches the opposite.<p>Well, no, books teach lots of things. Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s true, though.<p>> And it probably won&#x27;t impress you that I&#x27;ve found the opposite to be true. God has never let me down, but people let me down all the time. I don&#x27;t hold that against them, though, since they&#x27;re my brothers and sisters and they&#x27;re not doing anything I haven&#x27;t done before in some way. But God is always there. Often not in the way I want or expect, but God isn&#x27;t a wingman or a genie that He&#x27;s obligated to follow my mission and fulfill my wishes.<p>You do notice that you start with the conclusion that god exists and then go and find excuses for anything that with any other entity besides god you would count as evidence against their existence, right?<p>> I will say that you are very assured that God doesn&#x27;t exist, and logically you shouldn&#x27;t be. There is no way to prove that the God of the Bible does not exist. There is no scientific experiment you could whip up to use matter to prove the immaterial isn&#x27;t there. I&#x27;ve wrestled with atheism or perhaps deism before, and I&#x27;ve found that it takes a lot of... well, faith... to assume a negative.<p>You are misunderstanding my position. &quot;<x> does not exist&quot; is just a colloquial formulation people use for what epistomologically correctly would be expressed as &quot;I don&#x27;t believe <x> exists because I have not seen any convincing evidence for its existence&quot;. When people say &quot;santa clause doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;, they usually don&#x27;t mean that they have proved that santa clause doesn&#x27;t exist either, after all. I don&#x27;t affirm the negative, I simply withhold belief on your claim due to lack of evidence, just as with myriads of other baseless existence claims you could make and people have made, and withholding belief does not require faith.<p>Also, either &quot;the immaterial&quot; has some sort of predictable effects that we can observe, in which case that claim can be tested scientifically (not the immaterial cause, but the effect and the supposed rules according to which it happens), or it doesn&#x27;t, in which case the existent immaterial is indistinguishable from the non-existent immaterial, and in particular you cannot make any claims about its supposed effects on us.<p>In any case, you don&#x27;t get to shift your burden of proof onto me. You made the claim that some particular god exists, so you are responsible for providing the evidence, it&#x27;s not my job to disprove any claim you throw at me and to believe it until I have done so.<p>If you want to understand the standpoint of a skeptical/scientific atheist and what you can expect people like myself to reply to your arguments, I guess I would recommend this playlist to you as well:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkwq0YkXJA&list=PL8U_Qmq9oNY4I2RAT94zWGS3yo7Ma3QKI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOkwq0YkXJA&list=PL8U_Qmq9oN...</a><p>In particular the videos about specific topics.

I don&#x27;t mean my post above to be interpreted as &quot;who cares about the poors,&quot; which it probably could be.<p>Wages are certainly going to be an issue. As a consumer who lives in a below-average COL area, I won&#x27;t pay more for (to use a somewhat contrived example) a software product simply because its developers happen to live in SF or NYC, just the same as I&#x27;m not going to make the argument that someone in Belarus should be forced to charge me less for development services (though they usually will of their own accord). I think that plus the fact that real estate is very limited in NYC and especially SF means there is definitely an uneven pressure on rents v. wages, even for high skilled, in-demand professionals like software developers. Based on COL alone I&#x27;d need an 84.56% raise (according to BankRate) to maintain my standard of living in San Francisco, which isn&#x27;t even taking into account the higher Federal tax bracket or the 4x higher state income taxes. The math just isn&#x27;t there, and I imagine it&#x27;s much the same if slightly less extreme for other metros like NYC, DC, and Chicago.<p>Isn&#x27;t this just part of the fact that it&#x27;s more expensive to live in a city?

Alternative: make all income qualifying for those programs, and tax all income to fund them.<p>(2) Between <i>long-term</i> capital gains and most other income (including both short-term capital gains, labor, and other taxable income sources). Because the former are earned over a period of greater than one year, in a system with progressive marginal taxation on annual income, taxing them the same as the latter with no mechanism for accounting for the period over which they were earned -- especially when they are returns earned by sale of holding that aren&#x27;t regularly repeatable, rather than sales of small subsets of a large pool of assets structured so that long-term gains can be extracted every year -- results in overtaxation when compared to regularly repeatable income streams like labor income. Alternative: tax all income equally, but allow taxpayers unlimited freedom to recognize (and pay taxes on) income in advance of realization, and limited -- but some -- freedom to defer recognition and taxation of some portion of windfall income for a period of years <i>after</i> realization. (This stops long-term capital gains from being a dodge to get low taxes on repeatable income from large holdings, while not unfairly taxing non-repeatable long-term gains, and also more fairly treating irregular labor income.)",1449854467

One thing is for sure, the moment you play along with a scheme like that when the chickens come home to roost you won&#x27;t be able to deny you were involved and thus likely culpable. Some things are not worth any amount of compensation. Going to jail for some company or ending up holding the bag because everybody else pretends they have no idea why you did what you did would really suck.<p>Just imagine. Some German engineer was pressured into doing this. I guess it only counts when your decisions materially affect your own situation, in all other situations principles are free. Engineers should stick to their oath, and should use their fraternity to block stupid decisions such as these, even if that leads to individual hardship.<p>After all, what&#x27;s next? Bridges that collapse? Buildings that you can&#x27;t trust? Aicraft manufacturers? You have to draw the line somewhere and it is generally recognized that the engineering profession <i>needs</i> to be trusted by the rest of society if society is to continue to function. You can make mistakes as an engineer but you simply can not be caught even accessory to fraud, that&#x27;s risking the reputation of the profession as a whole.",1449854416

We don&#x27;t do that often (you can count on your hands the last year the number of times we actually updated MySQL), and with Second Generation you get to choose a maintenance window which we didn&#x27;t have for First Gen.<p>What&#x27;s different is that if we needed to make a change that required only querying MySQL, such as listing your databases in the UI, we would still need to bounce your instance for that functionality to come up with First Gen. With Second Gen we don&#x27;t need to, so we can add many new features without restarting MySQL. I don&#x27;t want to speak out of turn lest the lawyercats that come up with SLA numbers and such find me, but I am personally confident that once we exit beta, most customers should generally experience better than the 99.95% uptime we have SLA for First Gen.",1449853383

But I think GNU/Linux indicates Linux kernel, GNU libc, compiled with gcc -- which is actually kind of useful information. It doesn&#x27;t say anything about the Graphical UI (if any). Similarly I think Android/Linux is useful, because it indicates something about what kind of (binary) software you can expect will work - and what will not.<p>I also happen to think distinctions such as Debian/kFreeBSD (a Debian distribution based around the FreeBSD kernel, as opposed to (just) the regular FreeBSD user-land) are informative.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what one should/would call a Linux distribution with an alternative (non-GNU) libc that relied on a non-GNU compiler chain...

In fact, I am not dismissing them at all as examples of their genre. But they are not philosophy. Philosophy requires a certain form of questioning and doubt which those writings lack. Regardless of what genre they belong to, they also lack originality, which is something Tesla and Faraday had in abundance. If they uncover anything, it is the very interesting political foundations of a group of people, some of whom possess a lot of power in today&#x27;s society.<p>Also, I do not doubt for one second their ability to improve some people&#x27;s lives.

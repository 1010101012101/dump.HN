I had read ""Getting Real"" and several blog posts discussing the mythical merits of an MBA.<p>Second, I found that as I looked through my employment and education history all the MBA's that I knew were complete jerks. The incompetency was rampant and the focus was always on the next ladder of their career.<p>I went ahead and did it anyway - it has always been a goal of mine. I thought I could break the mold. I even went and continued to accumulate other certifications.<p>I have a great job, but I want to know how to position myself in the future. How do I avoid the trappings of the asshole MBA? How do I write a resume that is not dependent on the MBA/PMP/CSM/PMI-ACP title? Can you think of any examples?",1339279199

Only the lower lever is or is not ""binary compatible"", basically only how the code is loaded and how functions are called.<p>All the other stuff (libraries, apps) just take advantage of that, and whether higher level libraries exist or not has no bearing on whether a system is binary compatible with another.<p>Not only that, but a system can have all the libraries that another has, but still NOT be binary compatible with it.<p>For example, a simple OS X QT app can be ported to Windows with just a recompile, but the two environments are not binary compatible.<p>Availability of the same APIs and binary compatibillity are two things are what hackers (as in ""Hacker News"") call ""orthogonal"".",1339279045

Initially, I was skeptical, but I'm starting to think it makes the most sense.<p>Given the prospect of a severe revenue dip once Sortfolio is detached from the 37 signals brand, the asking price (450,000) is <i>very</i> high. Moreover, as far as I can tell, they didn't respond to bidder questions on flippa. To me, it seems like the bidders and the auction were ancillary to their actual intent. Like other posters, I think their actual intent was to gain publicity for the 37Signals brand (not Sortfolio).<p>I expect they will follow through on their original pronouncement by shutting down Sortfolio soon; however, I don't think they ever had any intention to sell it. I think they are smart enough to know that someone with 450,000 in cash is also probably smart enough to know that it was a bad deal. By providing a spectacle by way of flippa, the narrative is now more impressive, they reaped a lot of positive press, and they reinforced their commitment to their core products.",1339278651

4089416,comment,4088940,4088940,1,0,waffle_ss,,,"I think OpenID + owning your own domain is a good solution to this problem.  You simply put some special HTML in the header of <a href=""http://<yourdomain&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://<yourdomain&#62</a>; to create a ""delegate"" that points to an authenticator of your choice.  If this authenticator goes down or is compromised, then you edit that HTML stub to point somewhere else.  I prefer using my domain name as a single point of failure over my email address, because I think it's harder to lose control of my domain name (actually if I lose my domain then I've lost my email too, as that controls my MX record).<p>The problems are that not every site supports OpenID, and that owning/maintaining one's own domain isn't as easy as getting an email address (tough for grandmas to do).  The former issue would solve itself if OpenID would become more used (kind of a paradox), while the latter is slowly gaining traction, I think (now with sites like GoDaddy it's not too hard for lay people to buy a domain and write HTML with a WYSIWYG editor).

4089342,comment,4087631,4088905,3,0,ma2rten,,,"Machine Translation is an application of Machine Learning which is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which is a subfield of Computer Science. However, what often separates AI from the rest of CS, is that AI often tries to solve NP complete problems, which are not possible to solve exactly. In AI it's enough to solve the problem in 99.9999% of the cases (and sometimes even only in 80% of the cases).<p>In other CS problems it is often a good approach to come up with an algorithm and then think of an example why your algorithm or approach will not work. You can keep doing this until you come up with an algorithm for which you can not come up with a counter example.<p>In AI this approach does not work, because there simply is no exact solution. What you do instead is find the simplest solution which works for your problem (for some measure of best which can be measured by a machine), you find the biggest source of errors, improve your solution and keep iterating.<p>So after this general introduction, my points:<p>1. Yes, there are semantic ambiguities that can only be resolved with real understanding, but the real question should be how common they are.<p>2. The idea of statistical machine translation is not find specific rules or heuristics, but to find mathematical models that make a trade-off between computational complexity, the effects they can model and the amount of data needed to get good results (this is known as the bias/variance trade-off in machine learning and statistics). Also you want models that generalize to different languages and different domains.<p>3. It will probability surprise you that are algorithms that can understand semantics of language already to some degree [1][2]. So you should not see it like you understand the text or you don't but it's more like a scale. However these methods are not applied in the context of machine translation yet, simply because it's pointless before you get the syntax part right.<p>[1] for some wicket interpretation of understanding<p>[2] e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis</a>",1339277110

I suspect that someone is going to pipe up and say we need more than ""just anecdotal evidence"" or something similar. On the face of it, this would seem like a reasonable reply.<p>Except, I remember when PG said something bizarre about writing being a more important skill than speaking based on his anecdotal experiences of listening to good presenters (!) and everybody here loved it. Certainly nobody asked for data and the most upvoted comments weren't critical of the article.<p>Pretty much the same thing happened when patio11 wrote a <i>huge</i> document with ""advice"" for young engineers which as far as I could make out, were based on little more than his experiences making a few bucks selling software on the internet. He too had bizarre advice; for instance, don't go to graduate school. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know if this is good or bad advice. But, even if you buy into the premise of many HNers that anything other than a billion-dollar ""exit"" is a failure, going to grad school certainly worked out well for Sergei and Larry. Again, I don't remember any comments asking for data supporting patio11's assertions. Everybody just lapped it up.<p>Now I'm not trying to diss either PG or patio11. These guys have been ""successful"" and perhaps what they have to say could be useful to others here. That said, I've been watching threads on gender issues on HN for about two years now, and I definitely believe that these articles are held to different standards than all the other articles here.<p>I also see highly upvoted ragingly misogynistic articles. I remember one by a east-european developer literally saying that he would never hire women because they could potentially get pregnant (you can't make this shit up!). I'm sad to say nobody asked for data in that instance either and instead circlejerked about how women are not cut out for the startup lifestyle.<p>Sorry about the long rant, but I'll conclude by saying that it was these startling examples of misogyny and sexism over here that make me reluctant to comment any more. I actually want to delete my account but it turns out you need to e-mail PG for this and even then your comments won't be deleted.

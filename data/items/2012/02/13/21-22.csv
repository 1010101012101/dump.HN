I would scrap it and...<p>* I think you need to add an example project or two about what you can do with the Arduino (like maybe this one - <a href=""http://j4mie.org/blog/how-to-make-a-physical-gmail-notifier/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j4mie.org/blog/how-to-make-a-physical-gmail-notifier/</a>).

3587503,comment,3583328,3586825,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I was referring to the sendfile system call there. We've seen reports that on some versions of Linux kernel, it doesn't work, for some value of ""doesn't work"" that we haven't yet properly determined. We've also seen web pages that suggest Flask's send_file and send_from_directory would ultimately rely on that system call in some circumstances, though again I haven't checked through the code in detail yet so I don't know how accurate those reports are.<p>In any case, we haven't tried using the X-Sendfile functionality yet, and I'm making no comment about how well that works.<p>We do know, without any doubt at this point, that serving our video files using Flask's send_from_directory (using the default file wrapping behaviour, not X-Sendfile) is not working reliably for us with many different clients, where serving the same file statically straight from a web server like Apache works fine. We're still trying to identify exactly what it is that doesn't work, but in light of our discussion here today and what I've learned since then, I'm now hoping that we can just punt the whole set-up over to the known-working Apache implementation by using X-Sendfile and avoid the problem in the first place.<p>(Edit: Thanks again for the suggestions, BTW. I had a fairly long list of ideas to follow up in relation to this problem, including investigating X-Sendfile, but your mention of that here prompted me to look into it first and will probably have saved me quite a bit of time if it does work for us.)",1329170335

With the exception of personalized items (basically just my computer these days), I don't care much if somebody takes something I own given that I could get something equivalent easily.<p>As long as the technology was symmetric (that is, everybody had equal access to it), I think it would just make allocation of most items more efficient. Why should I own a hammer that I use once a year if I can just grab it from somebody who isn't using it at the moment? And then they could grab one from somebody else when the time came.<p>The issue with personalization actually has a parallel in the IP--there is copyright and then there is privacy; the two are different and it is eminently reasonable to support one but not the other.<p>Now, there would be some issues with your hypothetical world (e.g. who would produce stuff in the first place?) but I do not think they would be insurmountable.

3587484,comment,3587399,3587399,1,0,hluska,,,"First off, a thousand apologies - I went to your site before I read your reply. Consequently, you'll have a visitor from Regina, Saskatchewan polluting your results....<p>I'm going to start by talking about some things you are doing extremely well:<p>1. Great work coming here and asking for feedback. That takes a whole lot of courage!<p>2. I love how deeply you are dissecting your own work - you've got a great attitude!<p>And now for some general questions:<p>1. Are you sure there is actually demand for this? I know that this is the ugliest question to ask (and the ugliest answer to ponder), but I suggest that you start here.<p>2. Are you sure that the people who you think will be most interested (males between 18 - 30) are actually interested enough in this to convert? Have you ever thought of targeting some retired people (especially engineers)? As an example, I know an engineer who just retired who would sign up for this in a second (if he lived in South Florida)<p>And finally for some criticism:<p>1. I really like your website, but I have some problems with the text. While the writing itself is great, I question whether 12px helvetica was the correct choice. I also wonder whether your conversion rate wouldn't improve if you increased the line spacing and decreased the total amount of text on the homepage. With the web, the more words you have the lower the chance that anyone will actually read all of them!<p>2. I question the information flow - if I were in your shoes, I'd likely design the information flow around a 'what is Arduino - what can I do with it? - why should I learn about it?' pattern. Might be worth doing a split test to see if that sort of flow has a higher conversion rate.<p>3. Here's a picky little thing that I only noticed because I'm a little obsessive compulsive about such things. Consider this scenario:<p>- I live in South Florida (I wish) and arrive on your website.<p>- I get down to the bottom and decide, ""This sounds cool.""<p>- I decide I want to sign up for the newbie package, so I click ""Signup Now"" (below the newbie package).<p>- I arrive on the Eventbrite page and discover that 'newbie package' has a quantity of zero.<p>Now I'm in some trouble. I can't remember whether I wanted the newbie package, the auditor package or the loaner package. Do I hit back? Will that mess everything up? Hmmm...I wonder what is happening on Hacker News....<p>All in all, great work throwing this event and if I lived closer, I'd definitely take it. I hope some of this helps!!",1329169911
3587483,comment,3585997,3586945,1,0,kijin,,,"Of course it's not purely about legality. Administrative burden was cited as the main reason. Also, the new policy is not only against child porn, but also ""all subreddits that focus on sexualization of children"", including pictures of teenagers in swimsuits. That's an unabashedly moral stance to take.<p>But I still don't think this means that reddit from now on will readily bow to public accusations of creepiness. This time, illegality, administrative burden, creepiness, and moral principles all happened to coincide. I don't think the same set of circumstances will easily obtain with respect to /r/trees or /r/atheism, which @alecco worries about. Illegality alone would not justify blanket censorship of ""grey area"" stuff. Creepiness alone, or moral qualms alone, would not justify censorship, either.<p>From the announcement: <i>We will tirelessly defend the right to freely share information on reddit in any way we can, even if it is offensive or discusses something that may be illegal.</i><p>When somebody else says things like that, we are often sceptical about that, and for good reasons. But I think reddit admins have earned enough trust among its regulars over the years to merit a more charitable reading. I doubt that they would ban entire subreddits for a small number of nefarious links if the subreddits themselves had other legitimate purposes. Maybe they'll tell the mods to take better care of their communities, but delete them unilaterally? Unlikely. That's the point I was originally trying to make; sorry for the diversion.",1329169900

3587432,comment,3585943,3586591,5,0,dkersten,,,"I love hard games, but there's a very fine line between hard and frustrating and pulling it off is difficult. For one, if I'm playing well and don't make many mistakes (how many depends on how far in I am - if I'm almost at the end, zero mistakes may be tolerable or even a good thing), then I expect to advance. For example, if I play really well and then lose because of an unforeseeable event, that's not ""hard"" - that's just frustrating. It's also closely tied in with fairness. If a game is only hard because the AI cheats (perfect aim, always knows where you are, always outnumbers you, infinite resources, whatever) then that is probably not going to be fun. It can be, depending on the game (eg infinite amounts of enemies are a fun challenge in one game but frustratingly unfair in another), but again, this is difficult to pull off. Repetitive stuff is rarely fun, no matter how hard or easy it is.<p>What makes hard games fun is the sense of accomplishment when you finally outwit or outplay the game. A constant sense of impending failure is a good thing. Failure is also not a bad thing, as long as you can learn from it and do ever so slightly better next time. Constant failure is not a good thing as it quickly leads to frustration. Anything out of your control is also a bad thing and leads to frustration (example: if I died because I made a mistake, that's fine. If I died because I didn't do exactly what the designer wanted and there's no other way to do it, that's probably not fine, unless it was obvious what I should do). Some games also expect you to die a lot, but dying isn't particularly painful, so its not all that frustrating (ie in VVVVV).<p>Finally, gamers often (maybe even ""usually"") make terrible designers, so unless you have proven yourself, designing a fiendishly hard game is going to be a pretty big gamble.",1329168852

Pls, destroy my ego.",,"Hello HN.<p><pre><code>   def tldr(): \n      (return 'A shallow attempt at casual humor to\n      engage(bait) HN readers into reading my dissection for \n      a promotional landing page. The subject is an Arduino\n      Hands-on Workshop It's not converting very well and \n      want experts to rip my approach to shreds.')\n</code></pre>\nI'm usually at the providing end of this exchange, but I am a student myself. I don't know everything(anything). So I humbly place my vanity on the shelf and expose my tender underbits for public rhoshambo-ing. If you promise to go easy on me, I'll try to make this beneficial/educational/entertaining.<p>I'm organizing my first group workshop. It's about learning to program and use the Arduino. The motivation here is to grow the technical community in South Florida. I organize an event in South Florida called Hack and Tell. (Imagine a grown-up version of show-and-tell for technophiles.) I can attract a pretty reasonable crowd but it's tough to find people to present interesting (or any) topics for the community. My hypothesis is that people feel the proverbial bar for presenting a project is higher than they are able to jump. So I want to give the local community something interesting to show off and motivate them with projects to present. I intend to dissect my marketing/promotional efforts in public in hopes the HN community would critique my approach?<p>With this workshop, I'm focusing my efforts on the 18-30 Male market with sparse discretionary funds (low budget). So I priced my event to keep my margins as thin as I could while still keeping this a viable proposition to invest my time into. To be clear, what makes this a viable proposition is breaking even on my tangible costs and netting enough cash to not completely bottom out my savings account while I take attention away from paying work. This is in return for connecting and enriching a portion of my community and generating some clout among my peers.<p>Before approaching this project, I did a little talking around to get an idea of how well this event might fly. I thought for sure I had at LEAST 5 strong tickets sold (without breathing) and while these people were very likely of converting in the first place, even a few who were more ""luke warm"" felt interested and might put down reasonable money for such an event. (Of course, seasoned vets know that words != actions. So I still take this with a grain of salt.) But I think this is pretty reasonable validation and move forward.<p>I'm compiling information from various sources who do an excellent job organizing this knowledge while putting my own rose-colored filter on communicating the content. Along with access to local experts and creating a really creative experience, this is the bulk of the value proposition that I'm attempting to sell. So I've created a promotional site to anchor my marketing activities and funneling all traffic through. (http://hackthisarduino.com. Thanks to bunsen for throwing the design together.) The website is the point I direct all my marketing efforts toward since it's a property I control and can monitor click-through for.<p>My approach with this is a semi-long form sales pitch. Keeping details succinct and straightforward while still ""speaking"" to my target market was the objective here. I've tried to minimize the amount of distractions (other links and content which doesn't support the value proposition) while focusing the visitor toward clicking the ""Sign up"" link to the right. I've purposely omitted any prices to help judge the actual interest in the workshop and isolate that interest from the cost-benefit analysis they'll do when faced with the price. This has the added benefit of controlling my pricing on one page and being able to do A/B testing to different price pages if I ever wanted to get that anal and had the extra time (probably won't be worth the effort). So far, conversions from the homepage to the pricing page are around 26% of about 250 visitors. I'm pretty happy with this but it could be better.<p>From here, I manage my registration/payment via Eventbrite. (http://hackthisarduino.eventbrite.com) Not sure how much the processor is influencing the funnel as most of the registration process is hidden from my analytics. My only option here is Google Analytics and they capture surprisingly little (helpful) information. If anyone has insight on properly using Google Analytics with Eventbrite, I'm all ears. I'll probably make my own registration page with Stripe on my next try. Needlesstosay, it's been pretty pitiful from here. (Two full packages sold.) I expect a few more, but have a personal goal of at least 10 people. (I have an awesome space to fill with about 40 in my wildest fantasy). My main challenge is getting this last leg of the funnel to convert. I'm essentially at the ""???"" step before the ""PROFIT!!!!"" and feel like I'm hitting the right points. It's making me second guess my validation, but I'd like to bring this to you (HN) for a second opinion.<p>As far as promotional efforts, I am highly involved in the local community and have taken several steps toward promoting to my market. Local programming meetups with verbal mentions, some tech talks with a nice plug at the end (My deck: http://nobulb.com/project/appliance_whispering/), inclusion in newletters (StatupDigest, RefreshMiami, event calendars, etc), friends, family and professional colleagues, social networks (G+, Twitter, FB, Meetup), email mailing lists, a few discussion lists and forums, etc. I've attempted to provide incentive for referral traffic ($20 for anyone who refers a sale...unfortunately, this is manual and may be creating too much friction for people to take advantage of). And early bird pricing which reduced tickets down to my cost (which was when my only sales happened) which was announced via the majority of these channels.<p>I know this was a lot to chew on, but I would LOVE any feedback or thoughts you have on my approach. Happy to discuss any aspect of this.<p>Thanks HN!",1329168249

I've dabbled with Ruby and the beautiful Python.<p>I abandoned dynamically typed languages for serious projects (those expected to work for > 5 years) because of the poor refactoring support and the dominance of style over substance in the community.  I work in the Enterprise, and there software maintenance quickly dominates the cost of projects making the big two static languages a better choice.<p>I still, of course, turn to dynamic language when they're the best solution to the problem.  For example for situations where speed of development dominates returns (think opportunity cost) or where a language is deeply embedded in a specific community (Python and NLP).",1329168136

The protection of artists must fall along some continuum: either no protection whatsoever, the strongest protection imaginable, or somewhere in between. So where do we draw the line?<p>In the last few days since I wrote my response to you, I've read up <i>a lot</i> on the history of copyright, and why we have it in the first place. And the line drawn by the framers of our Constitution and our early courts was this: Speech and ideas cannot be property. Giving people control over them endangers free speech and harms the public. But failing to do so disincentivizes authors. Thus, the goal was to <i>give the minimum possible protection that would encourage the progress of art and science</i>.<p>All the evidence suggests that the amount of protection that exists today far exceeds that minimum level. How can we justify that?<p><pre><code>  > They're not guaranteed success in the current marketplace, either.\n</code></pre>\nExactly, and that's great. That's how it should be. Copyright law wasn't created to <i>force</i> people to buy artists' work. It was created to prevent people from <i>profiting</i> off of someone else's work. It was created to promote progress in art and science. But today, it's clearly not. I've gotta run, but I'll leave you with this example:<p>Every 20 years, when the copyright on Mickey Mouse is about to expire, Disney spends a ton of cash to convince Congress to retroactively extend the length of copyright terms. They always succeed, but the consequences are grave. Something like 99% of copyrighted material is no longer commercially viable more than 10 years after its creation. But since copyright terms are continually extended, all of these works remain under the control of their creators, and are never released to the public. Entire decades worth of movies from Hollywood in the 1920s an 1930s have been left to decay, because their owners have no incentive to promote them, but the public isn't allowed to access them. Our entire history is evaporating before our eyes so Disney can keep making money off of Mickey Mouse. So to recap:<p>1. A great many historical works of art are being lost.\n2. New artists are not allowed to re-imagine old stories and art from a century ago, because it's still under copyright. (Ironic, because Disney created its art by re-imagining old fairy tales.)\n3. Content companies like Disney have no incentive to make new art, because they retain control of their old art.<p>So where's the progress? How does this system make art <i>better</i>?",1329167480

For arguments' sake, let's say we made a heap\n   (for one Erlang process) with 30M free.<p>b) Now the process moves on to a new phase: creating\n   large but short-lived binaries. Let's say 1M\n   each. Those binaries don't live on the heap, only\n   a reference to them does. So they only consume 8\n   (?)  octets on the heap.<p>c) If the references are the only thing using the\n   heap, then you can make 4M of them before filling\n   the process heap. But since they're 1M each,\n   they'll eat 4T of the binary heap. i.e. you'll\n   run out of memory.<p>As you found out, setting 'fullsweep_after' to 0\ndoesn't help, since a GC is never triggered. But\nexplicitly calling erlang:garbage_collect() does.<p>You can investigate a bit more using\ntracing. erlang:trace/3 can generate a message\nwhenever the target process is GCed (the\ngarbage_collection entry in flaglist). If my guess\nis right, then you should see that your processes\nholding all the binaries are never (or rarely)\nGCed. Tracing the GC is cheap, you won't notice any\nperformance difference if you only do it on a few\nprocesses.<p>The process_info BIF can also tell you quite a bit,\ne.g. the process heap size.<p>Disclaimer #1: my knowledge about the details above may\nbe wrong or out of date. But the mechanism is known.\nI've seen it in embedded systems and handled it in similar\nways to your approach.<p>Disclaimer #2: obviously I'm taking a guess. It's possible\nyou've run into something else entirely. That's why I\nsuggested some things to look at to confirm or reject my\nsuspicion.",1329167232

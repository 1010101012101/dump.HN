They were less apparent to people who didn't want to sit down and ask these sorts of questions.</i><p>This brings to mind my favorite communism story. 15 or so years ago my local newspaper ran a story about a young lady who was moving away to go work for the American Communist Party, because she had taken a trip to Cuba and seen Communism in action; it was clear to her that this was the ideal form of government for the people. That same day, the news was full of stories of people risking their lives to leave Cuba in homemade boats. It always amazed me how this girl could completely miss this.",1288324613

He takes his experiences and assumes that they can apply to everybody else that goes through similar situations with the same results.<p>I had my first child while I was still working + studying, and yes I agree that if I was doing my startup then I would have probably gone through major shock.<p>Having already had my first child, with the birth of my second and doing my startup, I knew what to kinda expect for the first few months + delivery. One of the first things I did, and realized, was that in order to have a good balance between the two, I had to get rid of the data plan on my phone. Otherwise, I wouldn't be 'in the moment' with my kids when I needed to be.<p>The result has been phenomenal. When I only have a few hours to get everything done that I need to do, I get a lot done. Still could achieve more, but am much more productive for myself with two kids than I was working for someone else with one kid.<p>I have also realized that it is better to do this while they are young enough to not remember these years too much. While I spend as much time with them as I can, the reality is that I will have to spend a lot of time working. But the trade-off is that if I do this now, in the first 5 - 10 years of their lives, then we can all enjoy more time and life in a different way when I am in my 30s and they are 8+.<p>Please do NOT interpret that as me neglecting them. I am lucky enough to be in a situation where there is a lot of support (in-laws live on the same property and we have a nanny - I live in Jamaica so the cost of living is much lower than the US, so it doesn't drain my bank account too much) for my wife and she is VERY supportive. She is being mom full-time, which significantly helps.<p>That being said, I make sure to bathe them a few evenings for the week and usually end up putting my eldest to bed 3/7 nights for the week (if not more, depending on what's happening with the family). Bedtime includes about 1 - 2 hours of dedicated them time - including stories, etc.<p>I have also agreed, with my wife, that I will take the night shift on our 7 week old. That usually means that I am up until anywhere between 5 - 7am with her, feeding her and putting her back to sleep in intervals. So I try to do as much work as I can while she sleeps during the nights.<p>As a result of that, I wake up about midday everyday and get straight to work. Usually work until 6pm, where I transition into evening routine. I don't know how long this will be sustainable for, but my wife is very flexible and supportive.<p>Some people might say I am crazy for doing a startup now (with 2 young kids), while many of my friends are working at bigshot jobs in the corporate world, but I think this is the more prudent route for the security and stability of my family in the long term.",1288324574

It will be easy, it will be a waste of time, and you probably won't learn much if you've already learned how to solve complex problems in abstract and invisible ways (programming).<p>That said, run the course and finish high school with a high GPA. Get the best technical degree from a college you can (of course money is an issue here, scholarships?) with some internships and a high-paced position at a growing start up and you'll be way on your way to success.<p>THOSE things said, take your spare energy and time to learn things that school or college won't teach you. For me, this was game programming, web design, n-teir architectures, SQL, databases, and web applications. None of this I learned in school, and I have a CS degree and graduated at the top of my class. Most well paying jobs with good opportunities require CS degress, but the Java-shop mentality they provide simply aren't enough to be successful.<p>Use your education as accreditation to get the attention you need from employers, and use your untapped potential and extra energy to gain the experience you need to stand out on a resume be an above-and-beyond contributor (I did this with experimental iPhone game development, web app development, check out www.scotthconner.com to see the projects I think fall under this category).<p>Finishing high-school is a must. Learning how to learn quickly and get shit done with little fuss is vital. Having a list of reasons you didn't finish school will count against you in every case.",1288324047

I'm using a throw-away account, but I'm a long time HN reader and all the advice that I've read here has helped me become a better developer. Now I'm here to ask for your help. I know there should have been existing threads like this, but my Google-fu is failing me lately so here I am.<p>I am a junior developer, more than 2 years out of college and had some experience working for a startup as my first job. I was severely underpaid, and felt that the company was going nowhere fast, so I decided to look for greener pastures. I have been getting interviews, and so far all of them have been positive. Not that I landed offers on all of them. They liked my attitude, but was disappointed with my experience.<p>I have a few offers on my hand though I have a tough time deciding which to take. The top two choices being:<p>1.) A startup with a product that looks interesting, small team, poised to grow in a few months, full of bright guys, seems fast paced. The problem is the salary is below market rate  (not as abysmal as my first job though), shares that won't make me rich (maybe enough to buy me a Macbook if they get lucky), almost non-existent benefits. I accepted this offer by the way.<p>2.) Then came company number 2. More of a consulting job. No core product. A quite large company servicing big-name clients. Smart team (maybe not as awesome as company number 1). Seems to be quite agile with regards to work. They offered me a market rate salary, with benefits that would make anybody drool. The problem is that you fly from project to project, without actually having something to call your own, which makes stuff less interesting.<p>I know that I should go for whichever company that offers the best experience. Frankly, being junior, I stand to learn a lot whichever company I choose. Technologies used are fairly equal and modern, with company 1 being a tad bit cooler, and company 2 being a couple of notches more enterprise. I'm leaning towards company number 1, since I'm more of a startup guy (I'm on HN after all). The rest of my family and friends think that I'm crazy for not going for company number 2. There's also the issue of retracting a job offer that I already accepted.<p>What are your opinions regarding this? I mean, I could go for company 1, but the practical side of my subconscious keeps nagging me for 2.",1288323951

In this case it is USD depreciation because of inflation expectations and virtually negative interest rate.<p>The USD has lost 20% in the last 12-18 months against many currencies.  I'm getting screwed because the actions of a country I have no say in are systematically devaluing their currency, which happens to be the 'standard' pricing unit of the internet.  There's not much I can do about either.  So two forces beyond my control are conspiring to make me earn less for the same amount of work.  That's getting screwed in my book.<p>The value of the products/services is exactly the same.  It's the pricing units that are changing, and changing fast.  People inside the USA don't notice this because they earn and consume in USD, until they start looking at a trip somewhere else.  Importing companies haven't really started to adjust prices yet, but the day is coming soon when imported items really start to jump in price.<p>Is there an alternative to trying to control inflation? Well, QE doesn't control inflation, it creates it.  If you're going to accept that a central bank should have pricing power over money, then you have to accept the tools they use to create inflation and disinflation.<p>My stance is that stable monetary periods are periods of growth and prosperity.  All paper currencies eventually reach their net worth - which is zero.  The USD is one of the longest lasting currencies in the history of the world, but nearly 100 years ago it was given over to a central bank, and nearly 40 years ago it was turned into a purely paper currency.  In that time period it has lost nearly 95% of it's value.  While that stimulates certain types of economic activity, my personal belief is that the bad has probably outweighed the good.",1288322420

It is lamenting the fact that people who eat ramen frequently aren't buying fruits and vegetables instead. I've basically lived on ramen for the better part of a year and the truth is that if I could eat healthier I would without a moments hesitation. But a ramen packet costs 15¢ each. So I can be reasonably full for around 30¢ a day. What kind of fruit can I buy for 30¢? A single apple? One banana? The author of this article needs to get off his high horse and try to live off the diet he's saying is such a bad choice.",1288321750

I recently realized that most of the classes I'm taking (all honors) are kinda pathetic. Because the classes I take are easy and not relevant, I don't put forth any effort. My school specializes in athletics, and I want to start a business or go to college now, and start learning more. What I've seen is that in high school academia, is that it's really ~70% of the time spent pleasing other people or rapid memorization that I won't use in my life after high school. I'm really passionate about what I want to do, and I'm ready to go through with my decision. So is it worth it to take classes at my community college and get a GED to go to another college, or should I change my mentality and try in my classes and graduate early?",1288321461

The problem is the lack of certainty over the outcome of litigation. Clearly iZettle have at least an arguable case that there is a risk of consumer confusion but obviously it requires a court's determination to provide certainty.<p>The problem is that the larger entity is more likely to have the resources to engage in litigation which in itself means smaller entities are less likely to fight back.<p>Trade mark litigation is often costly due to the need for survey evidence to show confusion amongst consumers. One benefit of going via OHIM (rather than the courts) is that costs are limited in this regard and you can get an early determination from OHIM as to whether there is a likelihood of confusion between the marks.<p>For example, if you applied for the 'Settle' mark at OHIM, and iZettle challenged, you would have limited costs exposure to the other side if you lost (although on the flipside, limited recovery if you won). Somewhat besides the point in the current case but I thought it an interesting point to include in my comment.<p>At least the existing trade marks incorporating 'Droplet' are in much more dissimilar areas so you are less likely to face issues with the incumbents.<p><a href=""http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ohim?ohimnum=E10714392"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ohim?ohimnum=E10714392</a>

Where Binney says that NSA has capability to intercept electronic communications and he suspects it is doing so without privacy guards. He however does not say anything about existence of personal dossiers on every US citizen. He also makes some estimates of new (not yet existing) NSA data storage capacity, and  deduces this amount of storage may only be needed if NSA plans to capture and store all traffic without filtering. However, this system does not actually exist as of yet, and his estimates are based on ""some reports"" and are hard to verify. While of course extreme suspicion may be prudent in every case where a lot of taxpayer dollars is spent on building new surveillance infrastructure by an agency that has had proven its disregard for privacy, it alone does not prove current existence of the program as described above.<p>The second link describes the program which was explicitly made to exclude US citizens, but after 9/11 they used also data on US citizens provided by telecoms, such as AT&T - namely billing data (i.e. who talked to whom). I see no mention on them having access to location data or internet traffic, or them doing it for <i>every</i> US citizen.

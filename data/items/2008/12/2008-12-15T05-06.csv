Much of this publicly funded research is done by universities under grants from the NSF and such, and they are allowed turn around and sell the resulting patents to the agribusiness conglomerates.  Not exactly a free-market miracle.<p>Wal-mart often demands public subsidies from small towns in order to put their store there, leveraging their massive outside scope and bargaining power with suppliers to be able to make their case to the municipalities.",1229320712

That's how stimulus works: The government must <i>spend money</i> on <i>things</i>, fast and furious, so that the manufacturers of the things will experience enough demand that they will keep their own factories open.<p>Otherwise you get the classic deflationary spiral of (e.g.) the 1930s.<p>For more explanation than I could possibly provide (dammit, I really <i>should</i> have taken an econ class...) here's Bruce Bartlett at <i>Forbes</i>:<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/12/04/depression-deflation-velocity-oped-cx_bb_1205bartlett.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/12/04/depression-deflati...</a><p>""Banks, businesses and households are all hoarding cash, not spending except for essentials. This is bringing on the deflation that is crippling the economy.<p>""The problem today is that velocity is falling faster than the Fed can pump up the money supply by buying financial assets, and very low market interest rates mean there has been little net increase in liquidity as a result of the actions the Fed has taken thus far.<p>""What Keynes figured out is that when conditions such as these exist, the federal government must step in to raise spending in the economy and thereby increase velocity. This means running a budget deficit, but that is only part of the solution. As noted earlier, spending just to buy financial assets does very little good.<p>""We also know from the experience with tax rebates in 1974, 2001 and 2008 that this doesn't do any good, either. People mostly save the money or pay down debts. Thus, rebates just become another form of exchanging assets that add little to spending (and hence velocity).<p>""Keynes argued that the only thing that will really work is if the federal government uses its resources to purchase goods and services. It must buy 'stuff' -- concrete, computers, paper, glass, steel -- anything as long as it is tangible. In other words, the government must spend the way households do, by buying things.""<p>---<p>One easy way for the government to spend like a household is to hand money to desperate households and have them spend it. The fact that this also helps newly unemployed people from growing hungry is just a nice side effect.",1229320092

You might become a good user of them but if you have any interest whatsoever in one day building cool infrastructure and solving really hard problems (as opposed to building throwing sheep apps), you may do very well studying these courses.<p>Which problems you will ultimately solve as an engineer you cannot know. Better to have a knowledge of at least 3-4 tools. What you may think of ""web development"" may really turn out to be a compiler problem.<p>Also see one of Steveys rants where he advocates learning compilers .. I dont necessarily agree with all his points but its still pretty decent.<p>edit : Also its much easier to learn RoR or Django whatever on your own than in the univ.

If you teach them explicitly, that is. Besides, those subjects are more within the domain of <i>software engineering</i>, which certainly merits distinction from CS, a point this article does well in alluding to.<p>I'd much prefer that additional programming paradigms were taught to undergrads; something different than the vanilla procedural/OO duo that is the unfortunate captor of so many a CS department. I'd argue that parallelism and functional programming are topics far more vital to an aspiring computer scientist than things like web frameworks and SQL.<p>To add to the shopping list, I think a nice proofs class would be worthwhile for CS undergrads. I also think a yearly seminar, project class would be helpful; a class where students can actually MAKE something of their own design.",1229317743

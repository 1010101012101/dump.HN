But Congress made that law public, because it&#x27;s a fundamental principle of democracy that laws should be public all the time, and every American should be able to find out what their government thinks the law means.<p>The FISA court is arguably the most bizarre court in the United States. This is the only court I know of that is structured to hear essentially one side  it comes from the government. A group of judges operating in complete secret and issuing binding rulings based solely on the government&#x27;s arguments have made possible the sweeping surveillance authorities the public only found out about [recently.] What&#x27;s noteworthy is there has been nobody there to argue the other side, and that is what we want to change. This court has to be reformed to include an adversarial process where arguments for greater privacy protections can be offered alongside the government&#x27;s arguments for greater surveillance powers. It should have a selection process that produces a more diverse group of judges, and a process to ensure that its important rulings are made public so that American people can understand exactly what government agencies think the laws allow them to do. It was a lack of protections like these that allowed secret law to persist for so many years.</i>",1376647162

6223035,comment,6222348,6222653,0,0,mbesto,,,"This isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve read a sweeping generalization from yourself based on &quot;personal experience&quot;. I have no doubt you have a lot of personal experiences and don&#x27;t disagree with your viewpoint (in fact my personal experience dictates the same) however, it is still a generalization. You&#x27;re talking about a cohort that you (and I for that matter) have no formal analysis to back up.<p>I&#x27;m American and I&#x27;ve immigrated to the UK. I know hundreds of Americans who have done the same. I don&#x27;t know a single one of them who &quot;has nothing to lose&quot;. So I could also conclude the exact opposite conjecture.<p>The reason I mention all of this is not because I think you or I are right or wrong, but because I think is disingenuous to provide arguments (from either side) without any formal analysis.<p>Anyway, let&#x27;s get back on topic. So if it 33% of immigrants are co-founding big businesses in the US that are helping the US economy, then surely we should be letting in more right? X * Z% = Y, increase  Z% and we get more Y, right? There&#x27;s a couple things at work here:<p>- The fact that 33% <i>are</i> actually making it into the US and creating businesses perhaps speaks the nature of the people who &quot;stop at nothing&quot; to live their dreams. The US immigration system is painful, but perhaps it&#x27;s this painful barrier that filters out all of the immigrants who don&#x27;t create jobs for the US and does identify the people that do.<p>- What is the ideal % for founders? Is it 90%? Is it 50%? If it becomes 90% then why shouldn&#x27;t it become 100%? Perhaps we could create an analogy to a silly american football argument and say &quot;85% of all NFL Pro-bowl players are African-Americans. Let&#x27;s get more African-Americans playing football!&quot;<p>- I have yet to see a reasonable argument for a system that correctly attributes the probability of creating a successful business by an immigrant to the US. For one, it is not a specific country. The article clearly dictates this.<p>- I believe the massive proponents for immigration reform stems mainly from high-net worth individuals that are complaining because they want to bring highly talented people from abroad to the US so that they can personally benefit from it. Equally, potential immigrants are complaining because they don&#x27;t have an opportunity to move to the US. If this is such a big problem, why not find a country that supports both? Surely there is an island in the Caribbean that could cater to this?<p>- I think you are right in that the mentality of the successful business creator is someone with &quot;nothing to lose&quot;. This is how America became so prosperous and heck it was built by immigrants 200 odd years ago. But surely there are people in the US with &quot;nothing to lose&quot;? I think it would be beneficial to understand more about the character traits of these massively successful business founders, rather than simply the country they come from. Otherwise, we&#x27;re using the same exact basis the the opposition is using - that this cohort&#x27;s characteristic is simply that it was born in a country outside of the US.",1376646401

6223004,comment,6220049,6222921,2,0,cbsmith,,,"> False comparison. The real test is against high performance memory techniques (like memory pools, which are relatively easy and common in practice if you care at all about cache efficiency) not &quot;typical use of the C heap.&quot; When you actually compare GC vs high performance manual memory management, manual memory management is significantly faster.<p>That&#x27;s not a false comparison. They represent about equal development effort (well, the GC version is likely still less effort).<p>Sure, if you spend a ton of time optimizing your memory usage for your specific needs you will do better than a general purpose algorithm (though it is remarkable how often those solutions often implement their own forms of automatic memory management tuned for their needs). If it turns out that you couldn&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;d be awfully hard to collect a paycheck (and in fact most programmers could not collect that paycheck).<p>Of course, even that effort would not measure up as compared to an omniscient GC algorithm (and the paycheck for building that would be even bigger ;-). What is the point?<p>GC&#x27;s do well. When you really need to tune memory usage, you get in there and do the work, and you and do that in GC&#x27;d runtimes too. A good memory manager will, for common workloads, start you off in a better place and make the work of tuning easier. Certainly there are cases where it won&#x27;t be so helpful, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they are &quot;bad&quot; at memory cache efficiency.",1376645637

6222941,comment,6220049,6222423,2,0,lmm,,,">For example COM has a 32-bit integer called HRESULT that all methods return. The high bit says something is an error. A few bits in the high 16 bits indicate where an error is from. The low 16-bits are private to whatever space is specified in the aforementioned bits. So if you take an error like 0x80070002 you can say it&#x27;s an error, from the Win32 subsystem, and the error code is 0002 or file not found in this specific instance. Another component can set the high bits differently and end up with their own 16-bit error codes. I find when I write COM code the errors are much more meaningful than in a high-level language because it&#x27;s all very explicit, you&#x27;re constantly thinking about it at every function call, whereas in exception-based systems it&#x27;s all just very haphazard and hand-wavy.<p>If you want to have an exception that just contains an error code you can do that (e.g. java&#x27;s SQLException works that way). Personally I find it much more useful to be able to give errors textual name, and declare a hierarchy relationship between errors.<p>> Actually this &quot;early return&quot; pattern is quite bad in plain C, because if you have N allocations for example, each &quot;return&quot; statement needs to free between 0 and N buffers before leaving the function. That gets very maddening. One way to avoid this is to have only one &quot;return&quot; statement at the end of your function and free any loose buffers if-and-only-if they are non-null. This involves either constantly re-checking some error status, or using a goto to jump to the end of your function when something fails. IMO the 2nd is much cleaner. (Let that wrap around your high-level-language brain... but also know that any large C only code base is doing the same thing if they are sane; grep the Linux kernel for &quot;goto&quot; and you might start to get a picture... and while you&#x27;re bashing C error handling and probably thinking ill for me for pulling out &quot;goto&quot;, please keep in mind your &quot;exception&quot; concept is really just a goto that crosses stack frames...) In the end this pretty well simulates what you&#x27;d do in destructors in a C++ code base following the RAII pattern.<p>Sure - exceptions exist to replace something you would otherwise have to use goto to do, that&#x27;s pretty much the entire point. But they&#x27;re better than goto for the exact same reason that a while loop is better than implementing a loop with goto.<p>> In my experience it, on the contrary the exception concept just makes sure you have no idea that stuff can fail, and every small failure in a &quot;shockingly&quot; unexpected place blows up your entire program and terminates the process. Or you have Java&#x27;s goofy &quot;checked exceptions&quot; concept and so lazy programmers will introduce do-nothing catch blocks to shut up the compiler.<p>You have the exact same problem in C. Either programmers have no idea that library functions can fail and never check return codes, or you have something like gcc&#x27;s warn_unused_result and lazy programmers introduce do-nothing error-code checks.",1376644095

6222938,comment,6221790,6222556,3,0,e12e,,,"Personally I use bash when I need to, well, script shell commands. Anything that is reasonably described as series of shell commands, filter/pipes.<p>There are a lot of best-practices that one need to adapt though, and there&#x27;s definitively a learning-curve. Generally scripts should work under things like dash, and not be bash-specific. That means delegating some work to sed/grep/awk (or being really &quot;clever&quot;).<p>I&#x27;ve found that using functions, and passing arguments rather than setting (global) variables help a lot -- and if you get to the point that you <i>really</i> want do debug, you&#x27;re better off rewriting in something like python.<p>I&#x27;ve never liked perl -- it&#x27;s always seemed like a bit of a pointless exercise in moving side-ways rather than &quot;up&quot;. I&#x27;ve never had to move away from shell scripts out of performance needs, only out of maintenance needs -- and for <i>me</i> perl buys me nothing in that direction.<p>Now, things like fabric[f] can make sense -- but the benefit of (ba)sh is that it&#x27;s guaranteed to be there (on a <i>nix platform) -- and it is great for bootstrapping.<p>I&#x27;m </i>not* a fan of how some projects use (ba)sh, though. The ones that list instructions like these (and there have been a few lately):<p><pre><code>  curl http(s)://great-tool.com/install | sudo bash
</code></pre>
They often a) don&#x27;t use https and b) require sudo/root blindly (rather than at least wrapping what needs sudo in something like:<p><pre><code>      prompt -p &quot;Need superuser permission for apt-yum-install libfoo [y/n]: &quot; ans
      if [ &quot;${ans}&quot; == &quot;y&quot; ]; then
          sudo apt-yum-install libfoo
      else
         echo &quot;Aborted.&quot;
         exit 1
      fi
</code></pre>
Which generally works rather painlessly -- and could be further &quot;automated&quot; by allowing a --yes-go-ahead, or checking if the script is running as root.<p>[f]: <a href=""http://fabfile.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fabfile.org</a>",1376644050

As technology progresses, difficult and complicated tasks of yesterday become abstracted away and become more accessible to lesser trained people. C followed by Java allows MOST programmers to not bother with understanding assembly, same with web frameworks, and i can see how it would be possible to implement a markup language that generates custom kernels. I can also see how within the next few years, we will certainly have easy to use machine learning libraries (there are already many good ones today) that bring the power of ML systems to programmers not trained in statistics and linear algebra.<p>That makes me wonder what kind of technical skills have long lifetimes, valuable in the real world (as opposed to merely being technically interesting), and are difficult enough to acquire that one doesn&#x27;t have to worry about competition against a low-paid worker army....",1376644029

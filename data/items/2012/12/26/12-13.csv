4969095,comment,4967533,4968969,1,0,Jesse_Ray,,,"You misunderstood my argument. I did not assert the existence or nonexistence of libertarian free will or compatibilist free will. Such assertions were beside the point. I was only pointing out that the argument to which I responded contained a logical error. It assumes that ""people do not have libertarian free will"" entails ""people are causally impotent"", but the former does not entail the latter.<p>As an aside, your omission of ""libertarian"" from the quote of me suggests that you might be conflating two kinds of free will. Because you talk about free will without specifying the kind, the meaning of your reply is ambiguous. Hence, I have trouble agreeing or disagreeing with it. For what it is worth, I do not deny that compatibilist free will can have various degrees of freedom, where the degree is a function of the complexity and arrangement of the things it emerges from. For example, I do not deny that humans, dogs, and cats can be said to have compatibilist free will, nor that the human wills have more degrees of freedom than dog wills and cat wills.",1356526679

You want to know why that idiot is calling technical shots while you're downwind of the complexity that he imposes? Because he played the game, and you didn't.<p>Now, the good news is that most software companies are running at about 5% efficiency. Most of the code they have exists to serve dipshit requirements that aren't necessary and make no sense. It's junk complexity that no one would miss if it were gone. Why is this relevant? Because if you're putting 8 hours per day into order-following grunt work, you're an idiot. Do that, and of course you'll have no time to work on interesting stuff. The way you get a better job is to spend at least half your day learning the skills that you'll need to get where you want to go.<p>Treat it as an optimization problem. You want not to get fired. That's one constraint, but not a tight one because a lot of people keep their jobs for years while doing very little. Your objective: you want a better job in a year. Are you going to get a better job within the same company, doing more interesting work? Or are you going to leave for an external promotion as soon as it's viable? No one is going to know if you put side-project accomplishments on your resume, so you should.<p>Most people only ""look for work"" when they're in shitty situations. The rest of the time, they either (a) coast, or (b) put their all into their assigned work because they ""really believe in the company"". Both of these extremes are ridiculous. Always keep an eye open for something better, and start your search process when things are going well, not when they've gone to shit, politics have turned against you-- note, 95% of firings are about politics, not ""performance""; that's an attempt to use middle-class guilt to prevent a fired employee from seeking legal recourse-- and you've lost your confidence.<p>You need to be selfish, because no one will look out for your advancement. Treat well the people who treat you well. Find ways to read machine learning books at work. (Don't open a book at your desk; that's political suicide. Get an e-reader or PDF.) One thing: don't write any code that you care about owning using company resources or ""working time"". If you want to turn a side project into something salable, get up at 5:00 or dedicate your weekends. It's not worth the risk.<p>So yes, the disgusting truth is that 90% of the work you'll be assigned will actually hurt your career. This is why, in most jobs, you should be putting just enough into your assigned work to get by, and using the surplus for your own advancement.<p>By the way, most of the work going on in the corporate ""big guys"" is junk as well. Yes, there are people at Google and Amazon who get to work on cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, but most people at those companies don't, you'll almost certainly not get such work in your first year, and the politics you have to navigate to get onto those projects will disgust you and, if you succeed, make you a worse person.<p>One solution would be only to work at open-allocation companies like Valve, but in 2012 there aren't that many of those yet. There will be more in the future, as they outshine the closed-allocation dinosaurs and starve them of talent, but that will probably take 10-20 years.<p>For the mean time, you have to learn to fight. One of the problems with most career advice sites is that they give AFC advice instead of teaching Game. The people who get to work on the good projects are those who figure out how to control the division of labor. They found a way to make people trust them ""prematurely"" and gained enough influence over the division of labor to have a niche. It's not a trivial thing to do. You'll have to go far out of your comfort zone, learn some social skills you might have been weak in, and it will take years. Right now, though, I don't see any other option.",1356525122

I've never seen any good job without it's share of maintenance, refactoring, testing, process, and meetings with drones.<p>I've also build software that generates other software, invented new frameworks, and devised algorithms that dramatically improved the way we make and build and move the stuff that's probably in your cubicle right now.

Remember, release fast, release often is today's mantra and this simply cannot be done with Apple.\nI mean, you'll lose a whole month of Apple bureaucracy before having the least hintch that your app fails because of some bug in your live setup. Small details which you can't sand off when you have those LONG release cycles.\nBecause of this I've always seen Android apps evolve much more faster and provide meaningful feedback from day one after the first beta release.\nWith Apple you can't have a beta release, nothing can go wrong, everything has to be perfect the first time.\nFor example, right now we have in both stores the same app with version 1.1.1 for iOS and 4.3.2 for Android. The IOS one is using the first version of our backend API while the Android one has forced the API to change four times because of business needs which have made the app evolve.\nSo basically, we release an MVP for IOS which is there, idle. And we have an Android app which is evolving fast, is providing cohort data, feedback, business models and new ideas are being developed only for it.

You can fire someone with two weeks notice in Spain, paying 33 days of severance for every year paid (used to be 45). AND take home salaries are usually lower.<p>What is done in practice, to compare worker compensations across countries, is to factor that into the salary equations, it means that workers are a lot more expensive than what the take home salaries might imply, but consider:<p>Employee A at an US startup has a take home salary of US$ 75.000 will cost US$ 100.000 or so to the employer per year.<p>Employee B at a Spanish startup has a take home salary of US$ 56.000 (43.000 euros), and it will cost US$ 100.000 or so to the employer per year :) , factoring in severance, healthcare, social security and other benefits.<p>As jordinl and others stated, most European countries have a three-month trial period for employees as well (edit: and it can be renewed, making the hypothetical 6-months-in non-performer as easy to fire as in the US).<p>So, an European employee is usually NOT more expensive than an U.S. employee, it requires different considerations (and setting aside money for severance & stuff). It probably is a lot more bureaucratic, but that's it (on the other hand, there are a lot less lawsuits). If the reason for moving into Europe was cheaper salaries, bad luck, but if the reason was an unexplored market, it should work out.<p>Edit: I do agree that there are some strong laws against beginning your startup in a garage, but the physical location shouldn't be a problem.<p>About starting a new company: you can buy a pre-made company for 150 euros in Madrid, and probably the rest of Europe, with most of the paperwork solved for you. There are plenty of programs for helping new startups get off the ground (depends on the country, some are more progressive like Finland)",1356523959

4968977,comment,4967344,4967344,2,0,edtechdev,,,"This is a naive view, with inaccuracies in at least one of the ""facts"" it claims to be wrong.  It's what I would call a level 2 grad student view.  Level 1 - you believe every research article you read and everything your advisors tell you, and you glom onto one area or viewpoint in particular without considering alternatives.  Level 2 - you reject everything that isn't in line with your viewpoint.  I've seen professors stuck at level 1 and 2.  Level 3 - you start to see what's 'right' and 'wrong' (and more useful or less useful) about everything you learn.<p>Consider this ""fact"" from the article, which has no citation whatsoever:<p>""Increased K-12 spending and lower pupil/teacher ratios boost public school student outcomes.""<p>Which the author claims is ""wrong.""<p>Actually the evidence suggests that it is right, although the effect of class size alone may be small.  And it is not just a matter of how much an effect reducing class size has on learning, but also in what circumstances and to what extent.  And even with these ""facts"", it doesn't mean that big classes are inherently always ""bad"" and useless - MOOCs are still quite useful even though 90% of students don't finish them.  And large class lectures actually could be made more effective if given after (not before) a lab or other interactive learning activity.  But a wealth of research has showed how one on one tutoring is generally the most effective method of teaching (which also directly contradicts the author's assertion that reducing class size has no effect).<p><a href=""http://www.districtadministration.com/article/does-class-size-really-matter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.districtadministration.com/article/does-class-siz...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.ppta.org.nz/index.php/-issues-in-education/class-size?start=4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppta.org.nz/index.php/-issues-in-education/class-...</a>",1356523646

How about a certain amount of 'connections' or calls? Does it matter how long the conncection lasts? All you log is 'user bought 100 connections' and it took 2 months to use them. Perhaps there is a way to log in the conncections inside the app, locally and not in a central database.

8563134,comment,8561080,8561080,0,0,Animats,,,"This is the price of competition.  It takes a lot of extra labor, over doing the stuff, to keep a competitive market going.  There are a large number of items where the advertising and marketing cost exceeds the cost of production, from soft drinks to movies to pharmaceuticals. This is an overhead of capitalism, and it&#x27;s a big one.<p>The financial system has especially bloated overhead. The US used to have a financial system with three big, independent sectors - commercial banks, savings and loan companies, and stock brokers and markets. The Glass-Stegall Act kept them separate. Trouble in one sector didn&#x27;t crash another sector, because the sectors couldn&#x27;t invest in each other. That ended in the 1990s. Trouble soon followed.<p>The whole hedge fund / &quot;private equity&quot; industry is a net lose.  &quot;Private equity&quot; is really leveraged buyouts using equity-to-debt conversions to reduce taxes.  It&#x27;s an artifact of tax policy, not a real industry. In many cases, the money ultimately comes from low-cost borrowing by banks from the Federal Reserve.<p>With different tax and regulatory policies, the finance industry would be about as big as it was in the Eisenhower era, far smaller than it is now. This isn&#x27;t a secret, but it&#x27;s not something discussed in public much.<p>On the medical care side, the US spends about as much in public funds on medical care as the European nations with state-paid medical care do.  But that&#x27;s less than half of US medical spending.  Find out what a &quot;prescription-benefit management company&quot; does, and how big they are.",1415210340

8562982,comment,8562351,8562351,0,0,saurabh20n,,,"The announcement itself is pretty sparse on the proposed approach, but given the research interests of Swarat Chaudhuri [1] and Moshe Vardi [2], I would guess they will attempt to combine recent advancements in program synthesis, program verification, and code mining.<p>Program synthesis: There has been a lot of interest in the formal methods community to automatically generate programs (for small instances) with the target specification coming from input-output examples (e.g., Excel Flash Fill [3]), program templates or holes (called Sketches [4]), reactive models of adversarial environments, formal invariants etc. Also the solution techniques used vary considerably: from game theoretic solving, SAT solvers, model checkers, to version-space algebras and others. The community has not yet fixated on a specification language, or a solving technology. The industrial nature of the tools being leveraged (e.g., model checkers and SAT solvers from the hardware community) gives hope for promising developments. A Berkeley course [5] covers a good spectrum of the current developments.<p>If I were to guess, maybe the Rice researchers are approaching the code completion/correction problem as mining for fragments of large codebases that are incomplete/incorrect and applying program synthesis to fill those fragments. Of course that would mean that they would also need to mine the specification requirements for those fragments. All of this is easier said than done, and it would be an ambitious project. Swarat has also done some really cool work on &quot;probabilistic reasoning for programs&quot; and &quot;verification of probabilistic programs&quot;, so that might be part of it too. (Of course, I may be completely off-base!

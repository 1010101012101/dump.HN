I remember watching a TV program on the subject here in Switzerland; they had the head of the Swiss psychology assocation on, with him basically stating that it's a feel-good construct for PHBs wanting to sound important (this was in the context of whether you should apply for a job with a hand-written letter, or a typed letter; it was the early 90s...) :)",1238313227

537206,comment,536181,536618,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,"I'm not sure what you mean actually. Divorce can be just as easily initiated by the woman as the man. The social stigma and familial pressure is there, of course, but it exists against divorced men as well (although the degree may be less).<p>Plus, if you think there is a lack of visible disagreements in arranged marriages (both happy and unhappy), you should come and stay next to out some of our neighbours. I'm not basing happiness on ""lack of visible disagreement"". We know our neigbours quite well and it's easy to see who is happy and who isn't.<p>Let me clarify: all I am saying is marriage works if both parties are committed to it. That factor is bigger than ""getting what you want"" out of it.",1238311992

537204,comment,536798,536798,0,0,sho,,,"Like everything, it would depend on the circumstances. You can't directly compare emotional and sexual behaviour with business trust. So I would draw a pretty ""hard"" line, in the language of the article.<p>The sex part is almost irrelevant. What would matter is how they did it, just like anything else. If they were a complete asshole about it, I'd ""note"" that, just like I'd ""note"" any other obvious asshole-ish behaviour, which is obviously bad. If they were discrete, good natured, trying to meet their needs while keeping everyone happy - isn't that a good thing?<p>Hell, I'd be inclined to look negatively on someone who <i>didn't</i> cheat if they obviously wanted/needed to. Stuck in a passionless marriage and unwilling to do something about it out of fear/devotion to ""tradition""/don't want to upset parents, etc? That would lead me to question their ability to act and take risks. If they wanted to but thought they couldn't get away with it, I'd look down on that as being insufficiently devious. Etc.<p>Look, marriage is not perfect or even unambiguously good. It's an artificial institution which, in many cases, is imposed on people by society. We could discuss this all day but bottom line, it's a complex and ""tainted"" subject and almost completely different from other types of trust and honesty. You might as well ask if you ""trust less"" someone who cheats on video games.<p>On the other hand, this article rings of self-righteousness. In my opinion, those who make a big deal about the moral deviations of others usually have plenty to hide themselves. So reading that article certainly makes me trust Mr Casnocha less, sure, now that I'm wondering why he feels the need to loudly proclaim his virtue. Regardless, I could certainly do without his sermonising, and lack of understanding of the human condition, if I ever had to do business with him.",1238311895

But I have to collaborate with people who live far away from me, which is why I created this web version of pen and paper for myself.<p>The idea is that several people open the same mockup and move stuff around on the screen while they're on the phone, talking about the mockup, similar to what you would do with plain old paper when sitting next to each other.",1238311039

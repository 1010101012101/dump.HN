11067672,comment,11063575,11067535,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>At what age do kids take this test?</i><p>There are two age bands for SAT test-takers. The great majority of test-takers are of senior high school age, mostly eleventh graders or twelfth graders in their last two years of secondary school (so typically sixteen or seventeen years old as they take the test). They take the test at that age for one part of an application to college or university, as the article points out.<p>A younger age band for SAT test-takers are younger children taking the SAT for Talent Search[1] testing. All four of my children have participated in Talent Search testing (inherently, all with the previous version of the SAT, or even the version before that), all testing for the first time in sixth grade (just before their twelfth birthdays). Taking the SAT, or the competing brand of college entrance test the ACT, at such a young age is to identify young people who are ready for more challenging levels of study than usually served up by United States middle schools (lower secondary schools). My children have taken various online courses or supplementary locally arranged group courses at late elementary or middle school age, and have taken quite advanced courses at senior high age. My oldest son, now a hacker for a startup, got into the world of supplementary mathematics courses, discussed in another article submitted to Hacker News recently,[2] and found that experience very helpful for his career development.<p>I agree with the statement that the SAT is<p><i>bizarrely simple compared to the college entry exams at my country</i><p>and that would be true compared to the university entrance examinations used in a lot of countries that Hacker News readers come from. On the other hand, the SAT or ACT are only one element, and not the most important element, of college admission in the United States, and it&#x27;s easy in general in the United States to enter higher education after secondary education--the majority of high school graduates do.<p>My children all score well on the SAT (and the ACT) when they take it at young ages for Talent Search. The key to the standardized tests used for college entrance in the United States is reading ability. Kids don&#x27;t read for fun in their youth like they did in my generation. I am amazed (and my children are amazed) at how little reading contemporary children do. My stock advice on getting ready for standardized tests is &quot;read, read, read, and read.&quot; My two older sons call the ACT, particularly, the &quot;American Reading Test.&quot; Anyone who can read well can ace that test.<p>A few years ago, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language. So what I tell my children about test prep, and this advice has served them very well, is read whatever you find fun to read, and keep on trying out new kinds of reading matter. Read widely. Read the cereal box while eating breakfast. Read a newspaper or magazine. Read books on any subject imaginable. Put down the video game and read. Get away from the computer (in our family, this sounds like &quot;Do as I say and not as I do&quot;) and read. Read, read, read, and read. Then there is nothing to worry about in any United States college entrance test.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cty.jhu.edu/talent/testing/about/sat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cty.jhu.edu/talent/testing/about/sat.html</a><p><a href=""https://tip.duke.edu/node/44"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tip.duke.edu/node/44</a><p><a href=""http://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/program/numats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/program/numats</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/03/the-math-revolution/426855/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/03/the-math...</a>",1455043804

Of course, I died instantly.  And in Diablo I, being killed by monsters (as opposed to being killed directly by another player) made you drop all of your equipment.  Internet Jerk, being high enough level to handle the mobs, then popped in, killed everything, and stole my gear.<p>I was devastated at the time, but now I can look back on it and laugh.

Assessment of higher education (processes, and outputs) in the Web.<p>> <i>Hospital activity is multi-dimensional and this is reflected in its web presence. So the best way to build the ranking is combining a group of indicators that measures these different aspects. Almind & Ingwersen proposed the first Web indicator, Web Impact Factor (WIF), based on link analysis that combines the number of external inlinks and the number of pages of the website, a ratio of 1:1 between visibility and size. This ratio is used for the ranking but adding two new indicators to the size component: Number of documents, measured from the number of rich files in a web domain, and number of publications being collected by Google Scholar database. As it has been already commented, the four indicators were obtained from the quantitative results provided by the main search engines as follows:<p>Size (S). Number of pages recovered from four engines: Google, Yahoo, Live Search and Exalead. For each engine, results are log-normalised to 1 for the highest value. Then for each domain, maximum and minimum results are excluded and every institution is assigned a rank according to the combined sum.\nVisibility (V). The total number of unique external links received (inlinks) by a site can be only confidently obtained from Yahoo Search, Live Search and Exalead. For each engine, results are log-normalised to 1 for the highest value and then combined to generate the rank.\nRich Files (R). After evaluation of their relevance to academic and publication activities and considering the volume of the different file formats, the following were selected: Adobe Acrobat (.pdf), Microsoft Excel (.xls), Microsoft Word (.doc) and Microsoft Powerpoint (.ppt). These data were extracted using Google and merging the results for each filetype after log-normalising in the same way as described before.\nScholar (Sc). Google Scholar provides the number of papers and citations for each academic domain. These results from the Scholar database represent papers, reports and other academic items.</i><p>so they compared hospitals by googling them?",1455042053

Second,\n    runtime invariant assertions were key in identifying the\n    underlying cause. A test like Jepsen can tell you that the\n    cluster can exhibit split-brain behavior, but can’t tell\n    you anything about why. The error messages from those\n    leader and log order assertions were key hints in tracking\n    down the bug.

If you get too far ahead, your gains are redistributed to those who you have left behind. By that definition, a pure Socialist system will ensure that nobody can ever get ahead of anybody else.<p>> I think you&#x27;re hitting on a bigger problem with American culture, which is the &quot;hard working&quot; bias. Is the employee who comes in at 7am and leaves at 7pm really a better person?<p>Ask this a different way: is the athlete who comes to the gym at 7am and leaves at 7pm really a better athlete? The answer is, of course, yes. Sports are 100% meritocracies. You either perform, or you do not. The color of your skin, the disabilities you have, the socioeconomic status you grew up with; none of those things factor in. You can either perform better than the opposition, or you cannot. Full stop.<p>There are very few people that would dispute that, yet for everything outside of sports there&#x27;s a subsection of the population that has convinced themselves that hard work somehow doesn&#x27;t equal success. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s harder for people to relate to entrepreneurial success than it is to relate to success in a sport because the metrics for sports are very well defined.<p>So if that&#x27;s the case, to answer your question directly, we need to define the metric for success. In business, that&#x27;s called profit. The hard working employee is a &quot;better person&quot; (your words) if their work results in greater profit for the company than the person coming in the bare minimum amount of time. If not, then yes, they&#x27;re wasting their time just like the Athlete would be if their hard work didn&#x27;t result in better performance in their sport.",1455041636

Really want to increase your chances of speaking to a manager or owner, and having their attention, sit down, order lunch, once your order comes out only then ask your server if the manager is available and has time to speak for a minute. Be polite, even if the food or whatever you ordered sucked. Even if the manager doesn&#x27;t have the authority, the fact you ordered and ate lunch there will increase your chances of getting a return call from the owner. If you have already eaten lunch or have other calls, at minimum order a drink and maybe a small appetizer or food to go for later. You may also go to their restaurants a few times before asking to speak. Grab a drink or whatever, take in the atmosphere during peak hours to get a feel for how they operate, who their clientele is, etc.. This will allow you to better tailor your pitch.",1455041563

Why would anyone take a risk on anything or try to exceed expectations?<p>You hate some odd quote, yet I hate this constantly perpetuated myth regarding socialism.<p>Firstly, the most &quot;driven&quot; people aren&#x27;t the wealthiest (though, it can occasionally be a side effect). The research scientist who forgoes money in some fortune 500 firm (or a more lucrative field of study) to instead focus on some obscure species of fauna? Probably way more driven than some sociopath focused on the bottom line.<p>Second, socialism isn&#x27;t about handouts. It&#x27;s about moving the ownership of production from the hands of one central figure to the hands of those actually managing the production. Usually, this would mean shifting ownership to the employee collective, not state ownership (a la communism).<p>It sounds like you might be making the mistake of equating &quot;social democracy&quot; (universal healthcare, social security, etc) with &quot;socialism&quot;. Even if that&#x27;s the case, I don&#x27;t see the issue with helping my fellow man with basic health and well-being. It&#x27;s pretty much the entire reason societies and nations were formed. We&#x27;re advanced enough to offer it at this point.<p>Lastly, automation is happening. At remarkable speeds. As we automate more, there&#x27;s less labor to do. Period. In 50, 100, maybe 150 years; there&#x27;s not going to be an option. There&#x27;s a very good chance there will only be work left for the innovators and dreamers (the &quot;Star Trek&quot; model, ascribed to by techno-utopianists), some day.

Seed and early stage has always been astronomically high risk, and so that&#x27;s more likely to be priced in. I think we&#x27;ll see a small pull-back there but nothing too serious, and it might be totally offset by the opening of equity crowdfunding (which I have mixed feelings about but it&#x27;s a thing).<p>I think this is the end of the &quot;unicorn.&quot; The thing that&#x27;s going to dry up is peoples&#x27; appetites for companies that are post-A and still don&#x27;t have a good revenue picture or have their feet under them at all. By the end of an A runway there should be some sign of liftoff before people are going to be willing to shell out more. There&#x27;s also going to be a lot less tolerance for drunken money spending unless revenue growth is really good.<p>Investors are going to start looking at bang/buck ratio instead of just bang. It&#x27;s easy to make a lot of noise and look big when you have $100m+ in the bank. I think the worst of the unicorns are companies that are mostly built to market themselves to <i>investors</i> more than customers and to chase cheap investor money. Those are dead.<p>I personally think the unicorn bust might actually be <i>good</i> for bootstrapped or less lavishly funded companies. It&#x27;s hard and very demoralizing to have to compete with SV insider companies running on seemingly endless fountains of VC cash. Those companies can just run you over with sheer brute force and lose money doing it and not care.",1455040962

First, I would agree that Django&#x27;s documentation could be more beginner friendly. But you know providing excellent cutting edge tool and providing excellent documentation is a very difficult task and  it does require some more love.<p>Django as a framework is very different form traditional CMSes like wordpress, Drupal etc. It is mostly meant to write scalable web services with great speed and has batteries included for example a good ORM, migration assistant, good admin etc.<p>If CMS is your usecase, you should have tried Django CMS(it is built on top of Django and support great features. (<a href=""http://www.django-cms.org/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.django-cms.org/en/</a>)<p>I think you need to understand that every framework or library in the world requires you to read the documentation. There is not shortcut.<p>However, Django CMS also comes up with a very nice installer(<a href=""http://docs.django-cms.org/en/develop/introduction/install.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.django-cms.org/en/develop/introduction/install.h...</a>). It automates almost everything. Whenever you change your model, you generate migrations and run it.\n  python manage.py makemigrations\n  python manage.py migrate<p>I think coming from other framework/language, just be a little patient and give it another try. If you still feel any issues, feel free to jump in the IRC (#django, #django-cms) and ask your questions. The community is nice and kind enough and you will probably never hit a roadblock.",1455040885

Word on the street is that Danger 2.0 (android) was acquired by google a few years ago. Everyone I know who works at google (except the lame people) hate it. Maybe you can figure out how to poach all those people.<p>Getting anything interesting onto an existing carrier's phones is a nightmare. Not only will you need to make a better phone OS, you will have to start your own MVNO. Helio has made an attempt - their ""ocean"" device might be worth looking at.<p>",1176799385
13584,comment,13548,13578,0,0,Tichy,,,"I tend to think about it like the Cambriam Explosion: it seems to me that at times a new technology comes along that is so much better than anything before it that for a while it's adaptors have a kind of free ride, untill a winner evolves. My personal favourite example are computer games: it seems most kinds of games were already being written as soon as home computers were available. Eventually a few genres emerged that crushed all the other ones. ""Doom"" was another such leap that triggered an armada of First-Person-Shooters.<p>So now for a while everything ""social"" will survive for a while, untill the big players have manifested themselves.<p>Anyway, I didn't want to make a point for iTunes, just ""prove"" that social networks are not the only kind of applications successful today.

Second, it takes way too much of my time to even think about them, never mind curate them. And finally, and most important for you, it permanently changes the way I write. Instead of writing for everyone, I find myself writing in anticipation of the commenters.""</i><p>\n<a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/06/why_i_dont_have.html"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/06/why_i_dont_have.html</a>\n",1176797766

13580,comment,13563,13563,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"> The irony is, the biggest disruptive innovation that ever came from the Internet could in fact be open source software, and the old industry it destroys will probably be <i>venture capital</i>.<p>The interplay between open source and trade secret is very interesting, as is the fact that possibly the majority of top-flight software development is open source and not going to make anyone rich.<p>People spend many years learning in order to contribute to amazing, complex software; yet they are shown up financially by kids with web 2.0 sites that run ads.\n",1176796908

In the second case, interruptions are terrible.

9096089,comment,9094553,9095834,0,0,kcudrevelc,,,"Hey, great questions!<p>Query Performance:  Right now, we&#x27;ve got test machines deployed with 8 500GB disks for packets + 1 indexing disk (all 15KRPM spinning disks).  They keep at 90% full, or roughly 460GB/disk, about 1K files/disk.  Querying over the entire corpus (~4TB of packets) for something innocuous like &#x27;port 65432&#x27; takes 25 seconds to return ~50K packets (that&#x27;s after dropping all disk caches).  The same query run again takes 1.5 sec, with disk caches in place.  Of course, the number of packets returned is a huge factor in this... each packet requires a seek in the packets file.  Searching for something that doesn&#x27;t exist (host 0.0.0.1) takes roughly 5 seconds.  Note that time-based queries, like &quot;port 4444 and after 3h ago and before 1h ago&quot; do choose to only query certain files, taking advantage of the fact that we name files by microsecond timestamp and we flush files every minute.<p>A big part of query performance is actually over-provisioning disks.  We see disk throughput of roughly 160-180MB/s.  If we write 160MB/s, our read throughput is awful.  If we write 100MB/s, it&#x27;s pretty good.  Who would have thought:  disks have limited bandwidth, and it&#x27;s shared between reads and writes. :)<p>We actually don&#x27;t use LevelDB... we use the SSTables that underly LevelDB.  Since we know we&#x27;re write-once, we use <a href=""https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/master/include/leveldb/table_builder.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/leveldb/blob/master/include/leveld...</a> directly for writes (and its Go equivalent for reads).  I&#x27;m familiar with the file format (they&#x27;re used extensively inside Google), so it was a simple solution.  That said, it&#x27;s been very successful... we tend to have indexes in the 10s of MBs for 2-4GB files.  Of course, index size/compressibility is directly correlated with network traffic:  more varied IPs/ports would be harder to compress.  The built-in compression of LevelDB tables is also a boon here... we get prefix compression on keys, plus snappy compression on packet seek locations, for free.<p>We currently do no compression of packets.  Doing so would definitely increase our CPU usage per packet, and I&#x27;m really scared of what it would do to reads.  Consider that reading packets in compressed storage would require decompressing each block a packet is in.  On the other hand, if someone wanted to store packets REALLY long term, they could easily compress the entire blockfile+index before uploading to more permanent storage.  I expect this would be better than having to do it inline.  Even if we did build it in, we&#x27;d probably do it tiered (initial write uncompressed, then compress later on as possible).<p>AF_PACKET is no better than PF_RING+DNA, but I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any worse.  They both have very specific trade-offs.  The big draw for me for AF_PACKET is that it&#x27;s already there... any stock Linux machine will already have it built in and working.  Thus steno should &quot;just work&quot;, while a PF_RING solution has a slightly higher barrier to entry.  I think PF_RING+DNA should give similar performance to steno... but libzero currently probably gives better performance because packets can be shared across processes.  This is a really interesting problem that I&#x27;m wondering if we could also solve with AF_PACKET... but that&#x27;s a story for another day.  Short story:  I wanted this to work on stock linux as much as possible.",1424717338

The potential combinations of nucleotides multiply exponentially when you have degenerate nucleotides in your search query.<p>It wasn&#x27;t the reference I was concerned with, it was the sequence I was searching for. :)",1424717103

I still wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that it is basically a rules engine.<p>The Rete algorithm (which is the underlying algorithm of most rule engines) trades off memory use for an O(1) execution time (where n==1 and n is the number of rules in the system). You really only gain any benefit once the number of rules grows significantly, and by then memory usage is significant enough that I wouldn&#x27;t want it running in my browser. If I had a the need for a rule engine in the browser, I would invest most my effort on offloading rule processing to the server instead.",1424717092

A bit sad that it&#x27;s in the context of Munoz being &quot;a mexican immigrant&quot; rather that merely being &quot;an awesome human&quot; but I guess that&#x27;s the angle here<p>2) There is a big rift between the UAV community and the general public regarding terminology. No one - not a single person as far as I can tell - in the community calls them &quot;drones&quot; because it is an ugly word and it&#x27;s associated with machines that fly to pakistan and murder people. Everyone - every single person - outside the UAV community does call them drones.

A UI expert pops by your office, asks a few questions, the conversation shifts over to work, you end up showing a few screens, talking about it.  You can do this in an office without worrying about disrupting the people around you (my experience is that devs tend to be far more sensitive about this).<p>So ironically, I actually think that open offices reduce the amount of communication between certain types of workers, because people who value quiet are shy about making noise (because they know how much it derails their own work).

The respiratory tract and the rest of the body may also retain far more of the products of cannabis smoke than when smoking a similar quantity of tobacco. Given the similarities in their constituents, there is concern that regularly smoking cannabis could have similar health risks as regular tobacco smoking, says the BLF.<p>> Also, people often mix cannabis with tobacco.

It is far too easy to get a license in this country: My test consisted of me, at sixteen years old, going around a suburban block with very little traffic at about 35 miles an hour, followed by a brief parallel parking test (a test I consider far less relevant than, say, being able to merge on a busy freeway at high speed). To qualify for this test, I only had to purchase an online driving course and fill out forms claiming that my parents had been me with me while I drove - none of which required time with a trained instructor.<p>Contrast this with China - one of the countries that you listed as an example of having bad drivers - where to obtain a license you need to pay the equivalent of a few thousand USD for a rigorous driving course in an isolated area (you can&#x27;t even drive on the road before you have your license; learner&#x27;s licenses do not permit you to drive on public roads). After this, you are still under some limitations until a year after you&#x27;ve obtained the license.<p>In addition to this, the more aggressive driving culture of China involves many more vehicles jostling for smaller spaces than would be the case in America. The skill and spatial awareness of the vehicle necessary to cope with this sort of environment is far greater than that needed to deal with even the most demanding driving environments of America.<p>We are definitely more laid-back and polite in driving than China (and I would prefer that any day) but more skillful? I highly doubt that.",1424716236
9095948,comment,9092504,9092504,0,0,acconrad,,,"The answer is (effectively) none.<p>In other words, for a typical $15mm exit, as an employee (meaning no preferred stock, and thus subject to a 50% tax rate on exit), you need to own ~13.33% of the company (pre-dilution, and thus, pre-Series A employee) to net $1mm and make you a millionaire. Of course, most companies go through plenty of dilution. If typical dilution is half, you therefore would realistically need to own more than 25% of a company to net $1mm on a $15mm exit.<p>No employee receives 25% equity of a company - <i>single founders</i> are lucky to have 25% when they exit. First hires / founding team are lucky to get between 2-5%. Assuming 3.33% (which is still high), dilution and taxes, you&#x27;re now looking at a $120+mm exit to become a millionaire as employee #1.<p>What is the likelihood a company exits for $120+mm? For YC companies, 10% have exited (54 out of 548 according to YC List). Of that, only 3 have ever exited over $120mm, which represents ~0.5% of all YC companies. Many are still active and valued over $100mm, such as AirBnb and Instacart, but again, since they haven&#x27;t exited in your 4 year time slot assigned to the problem, we can&#x27;t say what they will be worth, or if they will even exit or IPO in the next 4 years.<p>So if you manage to land a first employee spot at a coveted YC startup, you have less than a 1% chance of becoming a millionaire in four years from that company. So your typical startup after series A is virtually impossible by the odds. Therefore you either need to (1) start a company or (2) earn a high enough salary (or mixed income sources) to save aggressively that you can be a millionaire in that time.",1424716231

From open to closed, they are: collaboration space, personal space and private space.<p>Collaboration Space<p>Collaboration space is where ideas are hatched. Situated along main thoroughfares and between departments, collaborative spaces are bright, open, comfortable and inviting. They have no walls. They are flexible and reconfigurable. They are ever changing, always rearranged. Bean bags, pillows and comfortable chairs. Collaboration space is where you feel the energy of your company: laughter, big conversations, excited voices talking over one another. Invest in and showcase these areas. Real, not plastic, plants keep sound from carrying and they make air :)<p>Private Space<p>Private space is where deadlines get met. Enclosed and soundproof, private spaces are libraries. There is no talking. Private space minimizes distractions. Dim light, white noise. There are bean bags, couches and chairs, but ergonomics demand proper workstations too. Separated sit/stand desks with docking stations behind (bead) curtains with 30” LCDs.<p>Personal Space<p>Personal space is where people call home. In between collaboration and private space in its degree of openness, personal space should be personalized by each individual to suit his or her needs. Shared office or open desks, half or whole cube. Personal space should come with a menu and a budget. Themes and plant-life should be encouraged. For some people, this is where you spend most of your time. For others… given adequate collaborative and private space, a notebook and mobile device, some people don’t need personal space at all.<p>Above all, the goal of the Agile Environment is to create immersion in data through the physical environment: printouts, posters, books, whiteboard, etc.",1424715546

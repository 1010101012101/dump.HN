Sites that require you to wait for an email, click a validation link etc... have a higher barrier to entry.  Sometimes email is slow, sometimes it ends up in spam, etc...<p>Just let the users in at first to poke around before forcing them to validate their email.  After a day or two (or maybe to access certain features) remind them they need to confirm that email they got if they haven't already.  Yes, some people may try your product and you won't have their real email address, the the ROI on spamming these people later is probably not worth the initial friction.",1347569920

It only takes one bad mechanic to poison the well with customers.<p>YourMechanic hasn't reduced the time it takes to perform basic repairs.  The only practical difference is where the repair takes place and that you can schedule it over the web instead of over the phone.  Existing mechanics already offer at-home repairs (albeit, at significantly higher rates than in-shop repairs) so YourMechanic's ""innovation"" is really just offering existing concierge mechanic services for a lower price.<p>Here's the thing: any mechanic worth his oil doesn't have the free time to drive to customers to perform repairs.  He may have employees drive out to customers to pick up cars on his behalf, but he will remain back at the shop.

I don't think we'll ever get away from servers because there are definite advantages available by having computation centralized - you can have more powerful hardware available, you don't need to worry about outdated versions of code running, etc.<p>More broadly, though - there's nothing specific to a language that allows or disallows communication with a database. That's really the realm of a library or a driver to interact with the database (an external service) through some established protocol.

You could just look at the commit logs, but let me be more explicit.<p>* December 23, 2008: Merge announced<p>* March 15, 2009: Rails 2.3 released<p>* June 25, 2009: Rails XSS protection plugin for Rails 2.3 is released<p>* July 20, 2009: Rails 2.3.3 is released<p>* July 29, 2009: The first version of bundler (0.3.0) is released<p>* February 3, 2010: Bundler 0.9.0, the first ""modern"" version of Bundler, is released with support for Rails 2.3.5<p>* February 4, 2010: The first Rails 3.0 beta is released<p>* May 22, 2010: Rails 2.3.6 is released<p>* June 8, 2010: The first beta of Bunder 1.0 is released<p>* July 26, 2010: The first Rails 3.0 RC is released<p>* August 29, 2010: Bundler 1.0 is released<p>* August 29, 2010: The first Rails 3.0 final is released<p>As you can see, activity in Rails hardly ground to a halt during the time period we were working on Rails 3. We didn't even ship Rails 2.3 until three months after the merge, and continued active development for some time thereafter. And during this time, we backported two major new Rails 3 features, Bundler and Rails XSS, to Rails 2.3, actively releasing new versions of Rails 2.3 to take advantage of these backports.<p>Further, Rails 3 itself was a MAJOR feature release. Saying that Rails was ""put on hold"" for 2-3 (?!) years to merge in the Merb team is like claiming that Obama is going on an international apology tour. See below for a summarized list of important features.<p>I won't even talk about the improvements in Rails 3.1 or 3.2, which were possible because of the firmer footing we put the entire project as part of Rails 3 development. And this analysis doesn't even cover the major ways that the project structure changed during that time (full embrace of GitHub, significant increase in long-term contributors, acceleration of the guides project and other improvements to documentation).<p>---<p>Rails 2.3 was a major Rails release, with the following features:<p>* Completion of the Rack integration work begun earlier in the Rails 2.3 series<p>* Full integration of the Engines feature that was first softly integrated in Rails 2.2<p>* Localized views<p>* Support for public HTTP caching<p>* Ruby 1.9 support<p>* Nested Attributes (in both ActiveRecord and ActionView)<p>* Nested Transactions, even in MySQL<p>* A whole slew of other significant ActiveRecord improvements (<a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html#active-record"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html#active-...</a>)<p>* Unified rendering (render :foo, render ""foo"", etc.)<p>* HTTP Digest Auth<p>* Various performance improvements<p>* Rails application templates<p>* A whole lot else, see <a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html</a><p>---<p>Rails 3.0.0 was a major Rails release. Here are a few of the important features, but summarizing them all would be difficult:<p>* Incorporated direct support for Bundler, and drove the initial Bundler feature-set.<p>* Many architectural improvements, which drove improved, more stable third-party libraries in the Rails 3.x era  (<a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html#rails-architectural-changes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html#rails-a...</a>)<p>* A much bigger emphasis on eating our dog food: Rails 3 internals use exposed public APIs that any third-party extension can use. In fact, ActiveRecord itself is built as an extension!<p>* TMail, used by Rails 2.3, was unmaintained and extremely buggy (it often crashed when reading mail). The `mail` gem, written from Rails 3, is a ground-up rewrite.<p>* The ActiveRecord query interface is a night-and-day difference from the Rails 2.3 query interface. Users of ActiveRecord can now mix and match query parts (where clauses, group, order, limit) without having to worry about how to describe everything in terms of a single hash. This is probably the biggest change to the way developers use a major Rails component since the embrace of REST in Rails 1.2.<p>* ActionMailer finally got the update it needed. By Rails 2.3, ActionMailer had become a red-headed stepchild, sharing many features of the mainline render system on an ad-hoc basis. That meant inconsistencies galore. In Rails 3.0, ActionMailer got updated to share code and interface with ActionController, locking the two together to avoid another redheaded stepchild problem.<p>* Large improvements to Internationalization.<p>* ActiveModel makes it possible to use parts of ActiveRecord without using its SQL persistence layer. Apps have used this to spruce up plain Ruby objects, and libraries like Mongoid have used this to make alternate persistence libraries feel like the ActiveRecord people know and love.<p>* The router was completely rewritten, adding commonly requested features like the ability to match on any element of the request (commonly used for subdomain matching) and optional segments.<p>* The new ActiveRecord, ActionMailer and Router APIs maintained backwards compatibility with the older APIs until Rails 3.1 or 3.2, making upgrading plausible for more people.<p>---<p>Rails 2.3.3 was a minor update, with the following features:<p>* `touch` in ActiveRecord, to update a record's timestamp manually or automatically when associated records change<p>* Improved support for legacy schemas in ActiveRecord<p>* A general-purpose JSON encoding API and support for the `json` and `yajl` backends<p>* Other features: <a href=""http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/7/20/rails-2-3-3-touching-faster-json-bug-fixes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/7/20/rails-2-3-3-touching...</a><p>Rails 2.3.6 through 2.3.9 (The Bridge to 3.0) was a significant update, with the following features:<p>* Direct support for the Rails XSS plugin<p>* Support for permanent and signed cookies<p>* Support for table-name-prefixes for all ActiveRecord classes in a module<p>* Lots of 3.0 ActiveSupport backports and improvements<p>* Improved support for Ruby 1.9<p>* See more at <a href=""http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/22/ruby-on-rails-2-3-6-released/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/22/ruby-on-rails-2-3-6-...</a>",1347569452

4518511,comment,4517798,4518314,3,0,nirvana,,,"One additional point you didn't mention:  The US Dollar was, for a long time, the worlds reserve currency.  It still is in many ways.<p>This means that for nearly 100 years the USA has been able to print dollars and have much of the effects of this monetary inflation absorbed by foriegn countries that needed to hold dollar reserves.<p>Or put another way, there is a massive amount of inflation that has been exported.  It will remain overseas so long as the dollar remains the worlds reserve currency.<p>But as that changes, and the dollar loses credibility due to this ""Quantitative Easing"" (which is nothing more than a euphemism for monetary inflation) at some point the rate of people switching from dollar reserves to other reserves- gold, yuan, whatever-- will reach a tipping point and as the dollar declines ever faster people will panic to get out of the dollar.<p>This is like an axe over our heads.  We've got hyperinflation built in, because once that turning point happens, the panic will trounce the dollar, and that will imediately force the government to crank up the printing presses even faster- trying to outrun these ramifications, and we'll wake up one morning in Zimbabwe.<p>And I'm not kidding about it happening ""one morning"", when this happens it often happens very fast.  The Ruble lost half its value between breakfast and lunch when it happened. In argentina it was a matter of weeks.<p>Neither of those currencies were world currencies.<p>No way to know when it will happen, or exactly how-- we've been helped by europes problems.  Since they've been going down faster they have made the dollar look good in comparison.<p>We've also been helped by China's dependance on exports- as europe went down and we slowed down, that's hurt china, making them not look as relatively strong compared to us.<p>Finally we've also been helped with outright manipulation of the market.  One of the key indicators is the price of gold (which is really the price of dollars measured in gold.)  The FOMC is an entity within the fed whose job is to ""stablize prices"" which is also known as market manipulation, and it takes big chunks of that QE money and uses it to short gold.  Notice how gold was on its way to $2,000 when they killed that momentum and brought it back to $1,500?   That helps shore up the percieved value of the dollar.<p>If this sounds like conspiracy theory, google GATA and read the details-- the FOMC minutes come out eventually and their interventions in the gold market are documented.<p>I can't say what a fair value for gold is, but it is well north of $2,000.  (Say if you compared the monetary inflation in dollars since the last time there was gold peg to the gold price then.... )<p>But so long as people are made to believe that a currency is stable, they will keep using it and the currency remains stable.<p>When people realize the currency is worthless paper being pumped out at insane levels, then it will be treated as such and quickly attain that market price.",1347569321

I had major multinational corporation copying my designs, marketing materials, and more.  I even had customers asking me if I had gone into a joint venture or licensing agreement with some of these competitors because of how blatant the copying had been.  One or two patents would have stopped a lot of this on its tracks.  Of course, part of the ""business is war"" aspect of things is whether or not you have enough of a financial war-chest to engage in litigation.<p>One of the reasons I did not go and file for a couple of patents was my natural drive, as an engineer, to just want to build it.  Second was my stupid idealism at the time.  I truly believed that if I just built a better product I'd always be ahead of the pack, even if they attempted to copy my work.  I would later learn hard lessons when facing the consequences of these dumb, stupid decisions.<p>Keep in mind that I have huge problems with the patent system.  I have read through hundreds of patents.  Most of them are pure unrefined manure.  Bullshit patents.  And, yes, I felt that some aspects of the patents I was going to file for where bullshit.<p>I came out of school with this dumb-ass idealistic idea that makes a distinction between true invention and implementation.  Engineers solve problems and implement solutions every day.  These are not patentable inventions.  True inventions are, non-obvious, blah, blah, blah.  What a shock was it to discover that the patent office willingly hands off patents for implementation, not invention.  Hell, they don't even do that, they are handing you patents for ideas, you know, the shit you are not supposed to be able to patent!<p>If you read through hundreds of patents and are intimately familiar with both the subject matter as well as the industry to which these patents are relevant it doesn't take long to realize that people are getting patents for napkin ideas as opposed to true realized invention.<p>And, don't get me started on software patents.  I bet that if you were creative enough you could get a patent on the ""do"" loop, even today.<p>Boldly armed with all of this baggage and idealistic bullshit I trotted forward and built my product without filing for a single patent.  It didn't take long to learn the lesson that was waiting for me around the corner.<p>Patents, like them or not, have become weapons of the war business can be.  I can count with one hand the people I would trust without solid legal paperwork (be it patents or other instruments).  I have been shafted by people who singed NDA's and then went out and used what they learned from me to go raise funding and become a competitor.<p>Again, its' ""D"" vs ""R&D"".  They must have sounded like geniuses in front of the investors with all the product and market knowledge they stole from me.  Thankfully, in that case, they ended-up failing miserably (not before causing me some financial pain) because of the fact that they had no knowledge or insights of their own. You can only go so far without a real connection to what you are doing.<p>I see this Apple vs. Samsung thing both ways.  As I said before, I don't know who's right or wrong and don't have the time to figure it out.  We'll see what happens.",1347568266

I can also leave my IRC client running in the background without it constantly needing to reconnect when I switch back to it.<p>Intents in Android, especially in combination with the global Share mechanism, allow any app to receive arbitrary data from any other app, meaning apps don't need to know about specific apps or services in order to integrate with them.  Clicking on a URL allows you to choose which browser (or set a default) to open the link in, allowing you to use alternate browsers (or alternate email clients, SMS apps, dialers, etc); tapping Share in the browser allows you to send the current URL to any application that can receive a URL, making apps like Instapaper, Pinboard, and 3rd party Twitter clients have the same capabilities as first party applications.<p>Sideloading apps means I'm not limited to installing programs from the Android Market/Play Store, and can do things like buy apps directly from the Humble Indie Bundle and install them on my own.<p>Proper background service support, and allowing apps to affect things outside their sandbox, lets me run programs like Locale [1] that can monitor the phone's status, location, etc, and modify the phone's settings automatically based on a set of conditions that I've pre-arranged.

Since today's 2-year rate is the current 3-month rate compounded with the forward 3-month rates out to 2 years, that has the effect of pushing the yield curve down to near zero out to 2 years.<p>Step 3, (2011) 'Operation Twist', announce that you're buying long-term bonds and selling short-term bonds. That pushes low low rates even further out the yield curve.<p>Step 4 (today) buy mortgages via MBS, directly pushing down mortgage rates relative to Treasurys. Means lower rates for borrowers who can qualify for mortgages/refis. Also lowers credit spreads by taking away an option for people who want to get high rates by taking on credit risk such as mortgages/corporates, pushing lower rates up the credit spectrum.<p>bottom line... low low rates. Europe, China, Japan not doing too well these days, Fed trying desperately to avoid similar fate for US. Generally good for stock markets/startups, if investors can't make high returns in deposits/bonds they're more likely to try to find them in stocks/startups.",1347567924

4518396,comment,4517798,4518039,8,0,cjlars,,,"Finance geek here. The whole point of this is to raise inflation. Not by a lot, but by a little. The market is currently forcasting ~2.5% inflation looking forward and this won't likely push that expectation above 3-3.5%.<p>The reason for this is because the fed's 'dual mandate' to keep inflation low and unemployment low. The big theory behind this is the so-called Phillips Curve, which states that there's an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. The reasoning here is threefold:<p>1. It's believed that inflation 'lights a fire' under capital (i.e. it's expensive to hold cash), which spurs people to invest, which in turn creates jobs.<p>2. Wages are sticky -- after losing a job, people tend to be reluctant to take a big pay cut when accepting new job and so tend to wait for something better to come along. Paradoxically, people are more willing to take a REAL pay cut when the NOMINAL pay cut is smaller, as would happen in an inflationary environment (note: there's no change in actual spending power).<p>3. Higher inflation acts as a transfer to borrowers from lenders. Any debt currently issued before a change in inflation will have been valued in light of lower epected rates of return. A change in inflation expectations effectively decreases the debt burden on any debt held before the change. This improves firm's balance sheets by decreasing the value of debt on their balance sheets, making them more able to invest.<p>As an individual, there's not much to guard against here. We should expect this to have a slightly positive impact on jobs and asset prices. We should also expect inflation to run a little higher, but there's little risk of any sort of run-away, or ""hyper,"" inflation because of this -- the fed can stop inflation as easily as it can start it by<p>[Edit: Corrected Taylor Rule to Phillips Curve]",1347567884

Especially, mathematics is much too important to be left to the United States public school system in its current condition. I was rereading The Teaching Gap: Best Ideas from the World's Teachers for Improving Education in the Classroom (1999) last month. It reminded me of facts I had already learned from other sources, including living overseas for two three-year stays in east Asia.<p>""Readers who are parents will know that there are differences among American teachers; they might even have fought to move their child from one teacher's class into another teacher's class. Our point is that these differences, which appear so large within our culture, are dwarfed by the gap in general methods of teaching that exist across cultures. We are not talking about gaps in teachers' competence but about a gap in teaching methods."" p. x<p>""When we watched a lesson from another country, we suddenly saw something different. Now we were struck by the similarity among the U.S. lessons and by how different they were from the other country's lesson. When we watched a Japanese lesson, for example, we noticed that the teacher presents a problem to the students without first demonstrating how to solve the problem. We realized that U.S. teachers almost never do this, and now we saw that a feature we hardly noticed before is perhaps one of the most important features of U.S. lessons--that the teacher almost always demonstrates a procedure for solving problems before assigning them to students. This is the value of cross-cultural comparisons. They allow us to detect the underlying commonalities that define particular systems of teaching, commonalities that otherwise hide in the background."" p. 77<p>Plenty of authors, including some who should be better known and mentioned more often by HN participants, have had plenty of thoughtful things to say about ways in which United States mathematical education could improve.<p>In February 2012, Annie Keeghan wrote a blog post, ""Afraid of Your Child's Math Textbook?

The deals fell through and they went to court.<p>The truth is everyone has been and is suing Apple, all the time. <a href=""http://c4sif.org/2012/04/web-of-tech-patent-lawsuits-infographic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c4sif.org/2012/04/web-of-tech-patent-lawsuits-infogra...</a> This graphic is now 9 month old. Truth is Apple is the most sued company in tech! I just don't get this 'down with Apple' mentality. It's completely irrational.<p>When Apple entered the phone telecom industry, it turned telecoms on their head. Apple started to take control from these awful companies (see my article on t-mobile: <a href=""http://news.nucleusdevelopment.com/2012/09/11/t-mobile-inflated-my-bill-by-242-and-thought-i-wouldnt-notice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nucleusdevelopment.com/2012/09/11/t-mobile-infla...</a>) and give it to consumers. Remember verizon didn't want any part of the iPhone because 'it gave the consumer too much control'?<p>Google and Samsung have been helping the telecoms regain control, allowing crapware and bloatware to go right back on the phones. That is one of the very things that Apple fought so hard to keep off their phones, and one of the main reasons Verizon didn't initially want Apple as a vendor. Not to mention, The spyware that gets installed with out our knowledge, ie: Carrier IQ. Controlling the software OS on the phones (ei: why it takes so long to get a new version of Android on your existing phone).",1347567551

4518325,comment,4517426,4517426,1,0,JangoSteve,,,"Good writeup. There were a couple things you probably could have done better (which you probably know).<p>* Nevada LLC - Half the time I've seen people do it, it's not worth the effort to form a company outside your actual state of operation. Especially not for an LLC, which is already not well suited for companies which plan to take outside investment at any point.<p>* LegalZoom - This is also usually not worth it. You mentioned in your post that LegalZoom is a major part of your expenses so far. Did you take a few minutes to actually look at your state's website for creating an LLC? Here in Michigan, it's literally a one-page form that takes less than 2 minutes to fill out, with a $25 filing fee. And yet, I meet people all the time here who used LegalZoom to form their LLC.<p>* Filing an LLC simply for personal protection - A lot of people don't realize that simply filing an LLC does <i>not</i> protect your personal assets. Someone can still try to sue you personally and it's up to the court to decide if your LLC is valid and protects you personally. Filing is easy. But you have to actually operate on a day-to-day basis like a real company for it to hold up in court should the time come. This means doing things like doing <i>all</i> transactions through a separate company bank account, presenting yourself as a representative of your company when you meet potential partners or customers (e.g. making sure your LLC is on your business card), using the LLC for all legal docs, dealing with applicable business insurances, etc. IANAL, so be sure to look up the actual rules of the game for your state.<p>* Kickstarter title - I didn't think it was that good. It doesn't even mention ""iPhone"" in the title, so I would have had no clue what you're talking about without visiting the page and reading up.<p>I don't want to sound like this is all negative though.

Say you had 40% margins and were trying to service that debt with your 400k of gross profit.<p>You would not be in business long.<p>The fiscal reality of the US government is the same save for one key fact: they can print money. As a result, they can carry on this sorry fiscal situation for an amazingly long time, but not forever.<p>Japan has been in this situation more than a decade. They remain powerful.<p>This state of affairs will affect you as a company in these ways:<p>1. Your taxes must go up. This isn't a political thing so much as bottom line math thing. The more they take in revenue from you, the less they have to borrow or print and the longer this whole system keeps going. They can tax the rich at 100% and still not have nearly enough money to service their current debt, let alone the constantly increasing spend.<p>2. Market certainty will go down. No one wants increased taxes - politicians or citizens. This pressure from both sides creates things like the coming 'fiscal cliff' where either we reach a budget cutting agreement or draconian cuts go into effect. The market hates not knowing and people spend less in these cases. It looks like there will be a pattern of these occurring in the foreseeable future, which means less people spending less money with your business.<p>3. Dollars will be worth less. To hold the true value you receive for your service steady, you will have to increase the number of dollars you ask for from customers. Unfortunately, these customers will have less dollars in their pocket because wage inflation tends to trail price inflation. Be aware that as long as the US can borrow money and keep interest rates on bonds low as a result, inflation reported by the feds will remain low. It also pays to be the tallest midget. US dollars remain the world standard, so when there is a panic in Europe or Asia, people rush to buy our bonds, which bolsters our dollar and purchasing power relative to other nations. This ends when the market no longer believes we can pay. This could be tomorrow, next year, in 10 years or never if we really get our act together.<p>4. The dollars you've earned might not be worth much when you go to spend them. Say there's nothing to worry about for the next 10 years, but then it gets so bad that the market says 'enough, we're not buying these bonds anymore USA.' The USA at that point can print the money and pay the bonds with it or default. Either way, the dollars you earned through sweat and tears aren't worth much and the business that made them isn't attractive to customers at the ""new normal"" price points. At this nearly worst case point, you are poor, hit from both sides of the inflation game. This is one reason any thread of this nature has at least one mention of 'Gold!', as it holds its value no matter what the government does - assuming you can both hold onto it and trade it for fair value when you need it.",1347567103

75166,story,,,6,0,shayan,"How To Launch A Platform in 2007",http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/11/no-conflict-no-.html,"Mr. Fred Wilson brings up an interesting point that product promotion is also changing nowadays.  Blogsphere is very powerful and many companies, (even big ones like Google) are promoting their new products (even those as revolutionary as OpenSocial) through these streams over the more traditional big media event shows.
Bloggers tend to target a niche market for themselves and they have readers with the same interests.  Therefore, by reviewing they are in fact breaking up your product into pieces and each emphasizing on what they find most interesting (taking their niche into consideration).  Therefore, the readers learn about the new product and the features that would be most interesting to them, in a language that they can understand the best.  
It is as if a company is hiring a huge team of PR and is getting them to do customized/personalized promotion of the product for many different groups of people.
And keep in mind that this is happening at very low costs and is possible to be done by any company at any size and budget.",1193946472

Smart people are on both sides of these issues, and people who generalize usually do so just to have a political fight to score votes, not to try to understand.<p>I have yet to get into an honest political discussion where at the end of the day both sides were actually pretty close. The problem is that the media wants to present everything as a fight, so people spend a lot of time sort of repeating lists of slogans back and forth. To me, that sounded like what you were doing. As the national elections get closer, I imagine people are going to get more and more emotional. I like to compare our nation as one big dysfunctional family where the welfare check only comes once every four years.",1193946266

75161,comment,75045,75092,0,0,gigamon,,,"OK, got it.<p>I am going to assume that you want some kind of legal protection in terms of liability.  In other words, you don't want to do this as a general partnership, but as a corporation or sort so that as you move forward, there is no way that anyone can go after your personal property.  In that case, I would suggest forming a LLC, as I have discussed in another post.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=72291"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=72291</a><p>Then, you just need to take a piece of paper and write down that going forward, you each own 50% of the LLC which encompasses all existing and future intellectual properties.  By the way, I am really against giving away 50% since you have obviously put in a lot of effort in already but if that's what you want, you have the right to do so.<p>Then you price the LLC at some nominal value (say $500) and each of you write a check for $250 to buy 50% of the LLC.  Then on the same piece of paper, you write down that the shares that each of you own (say 2,500 shares for $250) are subjected to a re-purchase agreement (which is the same as vesting but vesting applies only to options).<p>The idea is that you have the right to re-purchase the shares from your new partner at the original price at anytime.  But part of the shares will be released from this re-purchase agreement either based on milestones or on time of service (four years, e.g.).<p>The reason that I don't suggest that you go to the lawyer right away is that you need to have this discussion with your new partner one-on-one and with plain English.  And it is amazing how much you learn about the person going through this process.  Going the lawyer will just put the two of you in an adverbial position from day one which is no way to build a team.<p>Once you work out everything in English, you can always bring in a lawyer (or not).<p>If you are still with me so far, then I can discuss the other issues.

I just am not the person to sit around wringing my hands over how bad the political system is -- and I'm a political junkie :)<p>I've consulted with large government agencies and I've seen the alliances that form between various players, congress, and various agencies. My opinion is that any cohesive group of people with a lot of time on their hands is going to try to take political power from other people. The caricature people use is Cheney and the military, but it happens all over the place. I remember back in the 80s environmental groups would go around to state legislatures, getting them to write very complex laws. Then they would hit all of the local governments, offering to consult with them so they would be in compliance with the laws they helped write! So the big old wheel just keeps turning around and around.<p>I will agree that the structure of the system is broken. Complex systems have a tendency to spin out of control. But in general the whole thing kind of hangs together anyway. We're not out in the streets with M-16s shooting at each other. Instead we can sit in our cushy chairs enjoying all of the benefits of freedom while we craft pithy arguments to toss at one another.<p>I remember when the economy was in the toilet during the late 70s. Carter used to get on TV and say not only did the country suck, it was pretty much all our fault. Here's hoping that form of leadership doesn't return.",1193944953

It shows a profound cultural difference between you and us (europeans) (again, I'm not implying that one is better than the other; just pointing out facts). You trust your fellow citizens to ""wake-up"" when enough is enough (""[...] whether those restrictions are temporary or permanent."", ""[...] voters will punish politicians who downplay the threat of terrorism."")
Most european countries woke up too late at some point of their history; that's why we tend to be more worried about the whole situation (and not because we're anti-american).",1193944685

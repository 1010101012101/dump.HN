324769,comment,324688,324748,0,0,felixmar,,,"Mono is not far behind. .NET 3.5 still uses the 2.0 runtime. Many features like LINQ are supported. Web frameworks like ASP.NET MVC can run on Mono. Mono has Gtk for UI development on Linux. Creating a modern replacement for Gtk like WPF on Windows would have to involve the whole Gnome community. Other newer .NET libraries are mainly for large business use. And Mono also has it's own features like DTrace support on Solaris and OSX which Microsoft can't match on Windows.",1223290345

324763,comment,324744,324744,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Good points...<p>10. Don't use too many colours. Three is about right.<p>11. Don't use too many bulletpoints. People just gloss over them in the end... There is a tendency to use them to cram as much information into a slide as possible. This never works, people just don't absorb it. A statement and a picture that you talk to works many times better.<p>12. Make the title of each slide (together) read like a story. A lot of people will just flip through a deck, reading the headline and glancing at the picture. People that print out PPTs almost always do this first. It also helps you structure your slides a lot better.<p>13. Get PowerPoint 2007+ if you can. I'm not obsessed with Office upgrades as a rule, but this is one product in the Office suite that is <i>much</i> better in later versions.",1223289438
324762,comment,324578,324578,0,0,ryan-allen,,,"My first was PHP, I was able to get useful things off the ground, mostly by trial and error, from what was initially very simple examples.<p>PHP's strength is it's so damn easy to write useful, simple scripts. And it's so fast to provide feedback, and it works with an existing metaphor many people understand (upload file to FTP, hit it in your web browser, bob's your uncle).<p>I found it very, very difficult to learn OO as the stdlib at the time was full of nothing but functions. I think you learn a hell of a lot from working with well designed APIs, and let us be brutally honest, PHP's stdlib is about as well designed as a shit-moulded santa claus.<p>I tried learning Java well enough to get some kind of commercial project off the ground but was befuddled, book after book why it took so damn much code to do _anything_. Though I did learn a lot about OO from reading these books, I never got an opportunity to get stuck into any Java to learn how to do things, at the time I perceived as the 'right way'.<p>But unlike PHP to get anything off the ground in Java, you had to install Tomcat, write about 20 lines of something and set up a web container and god knows what else. Compare this to plonking <?= $_GET['test'] ?> in a text file, call it 'blah.php' and hit it. Instant feedback.<p>Since then I've been working with Ruby for about 3 years, and I've finally got my head around how to write decent code, and it's mostly been because of exposure and experience with nice APIs, and being able to work with the higher level patterns that you are just simply not exposed to with rudimentary PHP.<p>Sure, today you have CakePHP, the Zend Framework but they only popped up in the last couple of years, and mostly in response to Rails' influence.<p>In between Rails and PHP I had toted with Perl and Python and enjoyed them thoroughly. I would suggest writing as much damn code as you can in a bunch of popular, and different languages, and you'll be fine :) I'm still yet to play with LISP and OCaml, though I'm keen to have a crack at Lua...",1223289360

324747,comment,323407,324509,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Yes, definitely. I'm gradually scaling up to bigger and bigger projects with it. (I'm about to release a small open source disk snapshot backup utility that I've been writing with it for the last week or so)<p>As for dealing with mixed source: your <i>or whatever</i> is the key, to some extent.<p>Interop with Java itself (classes, class instances, static methods) is trivial, you can also easily subclass Java classes, typically to implement interfaces. The syntax for java calls is pretty straightforward, e.g:<p><pre><code>   (. System/out (println ""foo""))\n</code></pre>\nThere are a few variations on the above that are also permitted; of course, you've got a CL-style macro system at your disposal should the need for more syntactic sugar arise. I tend to just wrap frequently used Java calls in a function.<p>Because of the excellent Java integration, other JVM languages are at least as easy to work with as they are from Java. I've recently been playing with integrating Rhino with Clojure, which on the most basic level involves implementing Clojure's IFn interface for Rhino functions and Rhino's Callable interface for Clojure functions so you don't need to use the Java syntax. Syntactic integration of the data structures, etc. would of course also be nice, so it's not 100% trivial.<p>I can't really talk much about other JVM languages as I haven't used any others. I suspect Groovy is easy to work with as it's so close to Java itself.<p>One big side of the Clojure language that I haven't worked with at all is the concurrency support, which seems extremely solid.",1223287484

This guy does not know the meaning of ""logic"" and unbiased trials for comparison.<p>In a nutshell: He actually entered 'dance club' in google and was ANNOYED by the lack of RELEVANCE AND DETAIL. \nNo no, rather than take .45 seconds to actually THINK about refining his search query to ""popular dance clubs in miami"" \nhe proposes that THE SEARCH ENGINE should sift though all of his billions of ""social utilities"" to figure out he was planning a trip to miami and so OBVIOUSLY he was looking for ""dance clubs in miami. But wait, there's more. His Google-killing idea further specifies that the results should list clubs that 'his friends' have recommended and like. So forget about putting ""popular"" in the search term, and forget that any NORMAL PERSON would just use yelp, no no  no no<p>the answer is to blame Google for its blatant disregard for peoples search stupidity and FIX EVERYTHING about your query, because you know...its brain is bigger than yours. duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<p>Good god that was bad. \nJust for kicks, uh yeah, its called the semantic web, people are working on it, and uh no, you did not invent it.<p>WOW",1223287446

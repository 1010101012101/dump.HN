Agner Fog says even Sandy Bridge doesn&#x27;t pipeline FP (or integer) divisions, which take from 10 to 14 cycles (less than two add/mul pairs). If the goal is to minimise latency for a small number of values, a lower order rational approximation might be preferable to a higher order polynomial; however, when we want throughput, add/mul pipeline better.",1435427977

9790927,comment,9789819,9790200,0,0,pdkl95,,,"14% of adult Americans (about 30M people) are functionally illiterate[1]. They are bad at reading things in snailmail, many just don&#x27;t see the value in it. We have records, stories, and even myths that seek to warn people about the disreputable men who take advantage of their mark&#x27;s ignorance.<p>Does society try to keep these people illiterate? Does we give up, accuse the millions of illiterate people of not caring, and find ways to hide important things from them? Do we simply let them stay ignorant while making sure we hide any books when they are around, because books when they are around &quot;because they don&#x27;t care&quot;? While I&#x27;m sure there have been been people who have done these things, we - as a modern society - generally find the idea of being illiterate to be a serious problem; serious enough that we spend significant amounts of money on education programs and other attempts to <i>fix</i> the problem of illiteracy.<p>Technology has created a new literacy. I&#x27;m not talking about <i>programming</i> or suggesting that people need to know HTML or anything. However, if you want to function in modern society, you need to understand some of the evolving language that society uses. This new literacy includes things like understanding that strings of the form &quot;xxx@yyy.zzz&quot; are probably an email address, and when you read something that starts &quot;<a href=""http://&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://&quot;</a> or ends in &quot;.com&quot; or &quot;.net&quot; is probably referring to a website. The fact that the educational system has yet to catch up to the changes in technology is not a reason to force decisions on people, nor is it a reason to accuse them of not caring; instead, we should be interpreting the problems people have with security as a sign that a <i>lot</i> more education is needed, and we need to find ways to help people learn so they can protect themselves.<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of people <i>in the tech community</i> that are confusing &quot;frustration at not understanding obtuse technology&quot; with &quot;not caring about security&quot;. Many people <i>do</i> care, but lack the slightest idea about how to even approach important technical decisions. Certificates, keys, signing, and the like are not what matters, and are minutia tha should be left to those with proper technical knowledge. What <i>matters</i> in security is where the trust is being placed, and that is something a lot of people <i>are</i> skilled at.<p>Obviously, change isn&#x27;t going to happen overnight. My suggestion is that we need a way to let people at least start down that path of managing trust. A good first step would be simply exposing the process so people can learn that a trust decision is even necessary.<p>[1] functionally illiterate is defined as those adults with a reading level below the basic requirements necessary to &quot;perform simple and everyday literacy activities&quot;.

(I feel like it should go without saying, but it&#x27;s painful to have to use symbols instead of spaces on mobile, and even a bit jarring at a real keyboard, and it makes password input prone to typos.)<p>What I got in response was some handwaving about the problem that amounted to a &quot;REQUEST DENIED&quot;.  (In truth, I did find that a bit frustrating.  The free email service I also use that&#x27;s notorious for offering no support finds spaces in passwords to be perfectly acceptable, but the one I have a subscription for won&#x27;t let me?  The one whose benefits are frequently touted as including, &quot;Believe us, it&#x27;s totally worth it.  Look how you can talk to a real human being.&quot;  If the choices are not being able to talk to a human being but not needing to, and being able to talk to one who doesn&#x27;t accept that there&#x27;s a problem, much less provide a solution for it, then the former pretty clearly wins out.)  But the frustration from that ends up amounting to a minor one wrt the digression that the developer who was responding went on to write:<p>> Probably later this year we plan to require client specific passwords for all external software. When we do that, we won&#x27;t allow people to use their login password for IMAP/POP/SMTP/etc clients, you&#x27;ll have to use a generated one. At that point, the only login place for your password will be the web browser<p>Okay, so here&#x27;s how my security setup works now:<p>Create a very secure password, and then... just use it.  Every time.  I.e., do not ask Thunderbird to save it, and do not set up a client to receive messages on mobile.<p>In the proposed new scheme, users will be forced to choose between memorizing whatever unmemorable thing the generator spews out for a non-web client, or enter it one time and set up their clients to save it.  Which is no choice at all; the latter is effectively the only one available (see &quot;unmemorable&quot;).  What this all means is that your pursuit of trying to make account access more secure actually ends up demanding that it be very un-<p>The end result is that at some point &quot;later this year&quot;, I&#x27;m going to have to take the same approach as noinsight and run my own mailserver[1], point my domain away from FastMail, and hope that my request for a refund will be granted due to the conditions changing during the middle of my subscription.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9790053"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9790053</a>",1435427423

Job done. Your change to a new argument, &quot;anti-gay prejudice&quot;, doesn&#x27;t undo the fact that not only in CA post-Prop-22, but all over the world for millenia, marriage has been defined normatively as conjugal.<p>Second, I know the exceptions, they do not prove the rule. Nor does the rule equal &quot;anti-gay prejudice&quot;. The word matrimony comes from the Latin word for mother. Revising history won&#x27;t erase the normative, biological basis of the conjugal marriage definition.<p>Anti-gay prejudice is a novel claim. 30 years ago many gays resisted or objected to early attempts to redefine marriage, as at least wrong-headed _embourgeoisement_, and often as much worse: an attempt to control and ban sexual expression. See Mark Simpson, e.g. Andrew Sullivan just wrote about this from his point of view.<p>It&#x27;s a cheap trick to scream &quot;prejudice&quot; and &quot;bigotry&quot; when the argument is over essential differences.

All an adversary needs in order to generate <i>all</i> of your passwords is your master password. Let&#x27;s walk through the steps of how an adversary can brute force your master password.<p>First, they will need access to a hash of <i>one</i> of the passwords you have generated. Say you use this application for every site you visit, and you have somewhere between 20-30 accounts. If only one of these companies suffers from a password leak, then the adversary will have enough information necessary to brute force your master password and generate your password for all other sites. This means that the sketchy site you created an account on to buy a phone case can result in an adversary gaining your well-protected bank password.<p>Once they have a password hash, they can brute force your master password in the regular way. All other inputs to password generation function are easily obtainable through minimal social engineering or guessing (your name, the site name, number of re-generations). I will note here that they did use scrypt, which makes brute-forcing more difficult (but not impossible). So, if you use a weak master password, not only is your password for the vulnerable site brute forceable, but all other sites you use in the present and the future will be compromised.<p>This scheme is not more secure than existing password management schemes (provided the password manager uses a good hashing algorithm for the master password like PBKDF2). It is strictly less secure because the security of all your passwords relies on the minimum security of all sites you use. It is also less secure because after a leak, an adversary can generate <i>future</i> passwords.<p>This tool should be used with caution and with these facts in mind.",1435426895

The reason is pretty simple - women are fucked with more than men. For whatever reason, when a male CO gigs an inmate, the inmate knows that it&#x27;s The Man keeping him down and not the man. In contrast, when a female CO gigs an inmate, the inmate tries harder to get out of it because he perceives weakness. As a result, more female COs crack.<p>This actually happens with <i>all</i> staff, not just guards. Nurses, instructors, whatever - all of them get routinely compromised. It&#x27;s a very, very difficult problem to hire people for relatively low wages, stick them with people who have nothing better to do, and expect everyone to remain professional.<p>The optimal male CO is an unthinking robot. &quot;Sorry, you violated Rule 131.

If the registrar is the only valid issuer of certificates, this loophole is closed since there is nothing for the CA to verify - the registrar already knows who the customer is and can offer certificate signing without an insecure DNS based domain validation.<p>For end-users with a hijacked DNS, the registrar-issued SSL certificate would still protect the transmission, because the DNS-spoofing adversary would not be able to present a valid certificate signed by the registrar. In fact, in today&#x27;s CA environment, if the DNS hijacker is playing ball with a rogue CA, they could also spoof the SSL. With my suggestion, they couldn&#x27;t, unless the rogue CA is actually the registrar, because the browser would see that the SSL certificate was not signed by the appropriate registrar.<p>You could create a DNS-style CA setup like this:<p>* Browsers would ship with ONE root CA, the public key of the &quot;.&quot; root zone operator<p>* Each TLD (&quot;com&quot;, &quot;org&quot; etc) has a CA signed by the root zone operator, valid only for signing TLD registrar CAs. The root zone CA could publish a signed list of TLD certificates daily/weekly/monthly (they shouldn&#x27;t change too often and the number of entries would be relatively low). Anyone could compare notes and see if these change. There aren&#x27;t any hidden intermediary CAs. Browsers could sync this list daily/weekly/monthly, the deltas should be minimal. ISPs could even provide mirror services, because the whole list is signed by the root zone operator anyways.<p>* Each registrar under a TLD has a CA certificate signed by the TLD operator, valid for only signing secondary domains under the given TLD. (i.e. customer domains). Just like the RootZone->TLD signed list of CAs, the TLD CA operator could publish a signed list of registrar certificates daily/weekly/monthly (again, they shouldn&#x27;t change too often and the number of entries would be relatively low). Again, anyone can compare notes and see if things change. No hidden intermediary registrars. Browsers could yet again sync this daily/weekly/monthly and ISPs can mirror the list since it&#x27;s signed.<p>* Registrants of customer domain (&quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;example.org&quot; etc) can request a domain-specific CA at their registrar, and only at their registrar. This domain-specific CA is valid only for signing leaf domains, i.e. &quot;www.example.com&quot;, &quot;mail.example.com&quot;. With the domain-specific CA in hand, the customer can create their own leaf domain certificates &quot;at home&quot;. The registrar should offer non-EV domain-CA certificates for free (there is no work to be done to validate domain ownership as the customer already has an account there), or charge a fee for EV certificates.<p>* There needs to be a way to determine who is the valid registrar for a given domain. This could be for example a TLS-based machine-readable WHOIS service address operated by each TLD. The TLS-based WHOIS service would negotiate TLS with the same TLD-CA-certificate as specified in the root list. Thus, a browser can connect to the TLD&#x27;s WHOIS service and validate that a given domain is under a given registrar, and that the leaf SSL certificate is signed by the domain CA certificate, which is signed by the registrar CA certificate, which is in the signed-by-the-TLD list of registrars, which is in the signed-by-the-root-zone list of TLDs. This stuff could also be cached at the ISP level because everything is chain signed.<p>Maybe this is how DNSSEC works (I haven&#x27;t looked into the details), but I think this would be a pretty neat way to limit the damage done by rogue CAs.",1435425139

Their time is also <i>expensive</i>.<p>My temporary solution is to combine endpoint encryption (eg GPG), MyKolab for address/storage, air gaps, and a guard. The MyKolab account gets me Swiss storage with associated legal protection & lack of clever Google-style snooping. I assume the servers are compromised along with messages. To deal with <i>those</i> threats, people send me either GPG messages or otherwise encrypted files. For protection, I can download them to a disposable, hardened PC; send them through a guard or data diode for reading; use a separate computer for writing and signing with a data diode. This is Markus Ottela&#x27;s architecture for Tinfoil Chat. His diodes with separate PC&#x27;s are simpler than my guards with KVM-connected PC&#x27;s. So I recommend it his way these days.<p>You can swap out MyKolab for any other service for delivery or storage.

The excess heat has to go somewhere, and so unless you have a cold sink, you have to add energy.  And if you&#x27;re going to colonize rather than just explore then you have to add energy all the time forever.  If the power fails, you die, she dies, everybody dies.<p>> why wouldn&#x27;t standard heat-dumping work well in a CO2 atmosphere<p>That depends on what you mean by &quot;standard heat dumping&quot;.  In space, you can radiate heat into the cosmic background radiation, which is the ultimate cold sink.  It&#x27;s about 3K, which is almost always colder than you want to be [1], so in space you get cooling for free.<p>If you&#x27;re inside a dense atmosphere, radiative cooling doesn&#x27;t work.  (There&#x27;s a reason they&#x27;re called &quot;greenhouse gasses&quot;).  You have to dump the heat into the environment, which is <i>hotter</i> than the temperature you want to maintain, so you&#x27;re fighting the second law, so you have to add energy.  At the altitudes we&#x27;re talking about here, you&#x27;re maintaining a gradient of 30-40C.  That&#x27;s <i>huge</i>.  It&#x27;s not impossible (the artificial ski slope in Dubai maintains a similar gradient) but it takes a tremendous amount of energy.  Where are you going to get it?<p>---<p>[1] There are some cases where you need active cooling in space, for example, if you&#x27;re running an infrared sensor on a telescope.  Those have to be actively cooled, usually with a supply of liquid helium that is launched with the spacecraft.  But see:<p><a href=""http://jwst.nasa.gov/sunshield.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jwst.nasa.gov/sunshield.html</a><p>for an example of what has to be done to keep an infrared telescope cool for a long mission.",1435424419

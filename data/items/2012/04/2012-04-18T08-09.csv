3857072,comment,3852341,3855895,4,0,skore,,,"I think this is the important point and one that seems to be lost on a lot of traders: Yes, what you are talking about is <i>logical</i>, but we as a society have the right to say: No, this is not beneficial to everybody.<p>The way many traders argue, they seem to have little shame saying that they want the system to give them a hand when they have made a bad decision.<p>> <i>If unexpected news comes out today that a company is the target of an adverse event like a DOJ lawsuit many market participants will want to react as fast as possible to the news.</i><p>No, I think the first thing you want to do is kick yourself in the butt for investing in a company that went down like this. If you invest in an oil company and it has a huge spill, the stock will go down and you will lose money. Don't like that? Don't invest in oil companies with a lousy safety record. Or invest yourself in making sure that the company that you gave your precious liquidity doesn't mess it up.<p>I would further claim that there are very few truly ""unexpected"" news. Traders are just a little too much in love with not <i>really</i> caring about what they invest in. At least not as much as they are in love with the money they make or the image that they are the ""market makers"" who provide the liquidity that we all need.<p>A DOJ lawsuit happens for a reason. Oil spills happen for a reason. If you have made a bet, you are the one who has to provide reasons for your bet. I cannot believe there are that many people who argue they should be able to rip off as many people as possible once their bet has gone sour. That the one thing they really need is to be able to rip others off as fast as possible. And that all this is somehow reasonable and useful.<p>I understand nobody really <i>likes</i> being the loser, but that's how capitalism works - filtering out the bad apples by having them go down in flames. Well, that's what it's supposed to be like, anyways.<p>> <i>Arms races are fair, but they waste resources.</i><p>Amen.",1334738996

Is AA prejudiced?

Not every investment has to be in exchange for equity.<p>Here, check this out: <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1804944614/the-sutro-mission-bicycle-designed-for-city-riding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1804944614/the-sutro-mis...</a><p>Look at the number of backers at the $6 reward level, at that level all you get is a postcard, the equivalent of a pat on the back or a firm handshake. Yet 29 people pledged that amount or chose that reward level. Also, look at the total backers vs. the sum of all the backers at each reward level, you get a difference of 30 people (170 vs. 140). 30 people who either kicked in a mere dollar or two or who chose not to receive a reward. That's at least $200 in funding with almost no return to the backers, a full 2% of the overall funding goal. And the 2 higher levels of rewards are similar, a $20 poster, a $30 t-shirt. There's another thousand dollars, 10% of their goal level, just with that.<p>Why?<p>The answer is that economics turns out to be a lot more complex than we've been led to believe. The ideal of the efficient and ruthless economic model human being, Utilitus Maximus, is a myth. Economics meshes with culture and society and they play off of and interact with each other. Here we have about a hundred folks who are willing to collectively chip in $1200 for a project that they believe in. Is this charity? Not in any conventional sense, there are no sick or hungry children here, just bicycles. But people are willing to support projects which bring about slight changes to the world, even if it's just introducing a new product, which advance their ideals or enthusiasms. And that's a very substantial indirect benefit even if there is no direct benefit. Ultimately transforming the world around you into the world you want to live in can be the best and most effective use of your money.<p>More than anything I think that's the flame which fuels the growing popularity of kickstarter.<p>The benefit for project owners, who are not always startups, is validation of the marketability of their concept, a pool of early adopters, up front cash of course, but also a more intimate connection between makers and enthusiasts. A while ago the singer Jonathan Coulton did an experiment where he forced himself to come up with a new song every week, which he debuted on his blog. Afterward he collected the best songs together and released an album. Similarly, a few years ago Markus Persson, aka ""Notch"", created an early prototype of an innovative PC game and he decided to put it out there into the hands of folks all over the internet and charge a relatively small fee for preorders of the full game when it would become available. As he iteratively developed the game, Minecraft, in full public view eventually it hit a point of critical mass and gained a huge amount of interest, and with it a large volume of pre-orders. He made so much revenue via pre-orders that he was able to found a game studio, hire several other developers, and even begin development of other games, before Minecraft even officially launched. To me that sort of heavily customer focused bootstrapping process seems very much of a kind with kickstarter. It's very much an extension of the new modes of business that are possible today due to the internet, due to social media, due to the ease of doing business without any middlemen other than the bank and UPS.<p>Granted, even on a simplistic level kickstarter still makes economic sense (makers take a profit, backers receive products of significant utility), but the higher order effects are interesting too.<p>There are alternatives out there, most of them are fairly similar. Soon there will be alternatives that support equity based investments. To my mind the biggest alternative is just to do it yourself. For some projects it doesn't make sense, but for a lot of projects it can be easy to incrementally bootstrap your way up the revenue/product development chain.",1334737074

Music degree --> Electrical Audio --> thepoint.com --> groupon? And having been somewhat of a Camper/Low fan for a decade and a half I had no idea about Lowery's background.  My feeble mind has been blown.<p>For years I've observed that the situation with music is very much like the hollowing out of the middle class.  The big guys like Metallica, Rolling Stones, Radiohead, they already have their money.  The countless small bands that play local shows, tour regionally every once in a while, put out a couple records - they're going to keep doing what they're doing as a hobby.  No problems there.  It's the mid-level bands (and the small bands that aspire to something greater) that are getting screwed.<p>And I think you're dead-on with your diagnosis.<p>There are isolated examples of labels taking the challenge.  Warp Records started Bleep.com years ago.  I have no idea how they handle their finances or share revenue with artists but they seem to be at least moderately successful. My impression is that Lowery is speaking from 20+ years of experience in the rock/indie rock world - how do things look for those making electronic music in all its shapes and sizes?  My sense is that the kids are more into Girl Talk than Death Cab for Cutie these days... that is to say that guitar rock seems to be in a waning phase.<p>For a long time I've wondered if there's an opportunity here for a different kind of record label, or really a new kind of music company.  Figure out a way to pay the artists fairly, with enough capital to be able to both invest in artists long-term and also take chances, with enough marketing muscle behind it to have a chance at breaking bands into the mid-level, and with enough tech savvy to (directly) co-opt and profit from drains like filesharing and piracy. Basically upend things enough so that (in Lowery's words) you could have a small operation could truly compete with the multinationals.

With the large teams they were finding there was just ""too much stuff"" happening at a single point and it became impossible to manage. Moving to a kanban style, and moving the various end-of-sprint rituals and spreading them out into their own cadences helped enormously - but I would imagine that it would be very context dependent.<p>The other thing I find useful about the kanban style is when the cadences of some work doesn't match up well with the sprint cadence. For example the more generative UX work (user interviews, etc.) doesn't always naturally fit into that 1/2 week cycle. Sprint-ahead/-behind is an abomination in my eyes - so having separate cadences helps a lot there.<p><i>Going from something like RUP to full-bore program-level Kanban in a complex business environment is just too far</i><p>Heh. With RUP you can probably find enough things in method composer to evolve it into something kanban-ish ;-)<p>Personally I'm not a fan of the big-bang rollout of new processes.

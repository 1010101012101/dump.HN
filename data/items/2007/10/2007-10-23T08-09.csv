71531,comment,71249,71367,0,0,ced,,,"I find it a bit jarring. Can you imagine a celebrity doing a TV spot starting with:<p>""If I'm going to be doing chemically enhanced social interaction, my substance of choice is kratom.""<p>And then cite benefits and studies. YCers might put their website on the front page, but I don't see it happening much in the comments.",1193129175

With a web based thing, I can go check it out, see how it works, and offer some advice.  With your business, since I'm not really interested in purchasing this stuff, I can't really tell you much at all.  Even with web based sites, I would be irritated if they were posted too often, so with yours, more than once is probably more than I'm interested in seeing. ",1193126850

They become part of the evaluation process although real work was to be done by security professionals at evaluation lab and NSA&#x27;s pentesters.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of one from one of father&#x27;s of INFOSEC that handed NSA&#x27;s ass to them in 2 years of pentesting:<p><a href=""http://www.iwia.org/2005/Schell2005.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iwia.org/2005/Schell2005.PDF</a><p>The original was based on custom hardware and firmware because Schell etc had good foresight. :) It was put on Intel because DOD and commercial sector wanted commodity products.

I general tone was &quot;My god, our planet is on fire and you want to spend time and resources going somewhere else?&quot; Which I understand, after all we&#x27;re spoon fed that message every day, but if you think critically about it you realize that the species as a whole will have to figure out how to live on Mars or its doomed anyway.<p>I get the emotional angst, many people will remember that point where they realized &quot;Hey my parents aren&#x27;t going to be here forever, if I don&#x27;t get job and stuff I&#x27;m dooooooomed.&quot; It&#x27;s a scary thing because it involves doing something you may have never done before or may have tried to do and failed a couple of times. But once you internalize the fact that your parents are mortal and of finite resources and you <i>can&#x27;t</i> change that, you put that fear aside and start figuring out life &quot;for real.&quot;<p>The same thing is true with this planet. Our ability to monitor it and study it has reached a point where we realize the environment we currently live in is going to change, and change harshly. While we&#x27;re currently the proximate cause of that change we know there are many things that can cause that change and have in the past. Perhaps not in the living memory of our species but we&#x27;ve certainly seen the humans frozen in glaciers right? So at the end of the day, <i>it doesn&#x27;t matter why</i> the climate changes, we must evolve our thinking so that we can live on an airless moon, or a chilly planet far from oceans and abundant greenery.<p>And getting serious about it means picking a problem to solve and solving it. If we can create a self sustaining colony on Mars for example I have no trouble believing we can create cities on earth that survive what ever changes come in the climate. And if we have self sustaining cities on Mars and Earth then if one gets blasted by an asteroid (known to happen) the other one can help out instead of everyone just dying.<p>Its the difference between moving forward into the future knowing what you have to over come, and hiding in the past hoping to somehow prevent the future you fear.",1446223706

Systems like Webpack and Browserify can perform these important functions.  The magic is the plugin ecosystems that assemble around your modules to form your software project&#x27;s build, test, and runtime systems.<p>The magic is that your JavaScript modules can be isomorphic and bundled to be delivered to and run identically on the web browser just the same as it can run on a Node.JS container.  The magic is that IDE&#x27;s now can grok these module specs and construct a type library - essentially treating the loosey goosey JavaScript language like it had static types.  Employing JSDoc comments across your entire codebase is how you give hints to the IDE about parameter types, what can be nullable or optional, etc.  You can essentially rig up a statically typed language out of modules and JSDoc comments in modern IDE&#x27;s like IntelliJ/WebStorm.<p>JavaScript ES3/ES5 is a crappy toy language, ES6/ES2015 is somewhat less crappy, but still backwards crappatible.

My method which starts with that protocol, applies a technique for protecting C code, uses 2-3 of AES candidates, has a different initial counter value, and a port-knocking scheme.

That means you must identify which part of the packet headers or data are used to do it plus how its done plus attack how its done. This is already a ridiculously hard problem evidenced by the fact that nobody&#x27;s ever bypassed it when I used it: always went straight for endpoints or social engineering attempts. Using a deniable strategy like SILENTKNOCK can make it provably impossible for them to even know it&#x27;s in use.<p>Next are the ciphers. They don&#x27;t know which one is in use. The non-security-critical values fed into it are randomized in such a way that they might have to try more possibilities than are in the universe just to <i>start</i> the attack. A weakness in any one algorithm won&#x27;t help them. Unlike most SW people, I also address covert channels: no leaks to help them. What are odds your attack will work on my users?<p>Next is the protocol engine. This is where they have a solid chance of screwing me up because mainstream loves dangerous languages, OS&#x27;s, and ISA&#x27;s. However, there are dozens of ways to obfuscate/immunize C code against most likely attacks and safe system languages I can reimplement it in while checking assembler. Further, if I make it static & a FSM, I can use tools like Astree for C or SPARK Ada to prove it free of errors. Without the binary and w/ limited online attacks, these guys would have to be geniuses to find an attack on it. After they beat the port-knocking scheme that was designed similarly...<p>The use of provably strong mechanisms in layers is in NSA&#x27;s own evaluation criteria as the kind of thing that stops nation-states. And stopped NSA&#x27;s own red teams in the past during A1/EAL6/EAL7 evaluations. They depend on it for most critical stuff. Applying sound principles plus things easy for defender but exponentially harder for attacker makes a fence so high even nation-states have trouble jumping over it. They&#x27;re forced to do one of several things: use very best attacks that might be lost during a detection; get physical, increasing odds of detection; ignore you to attack someone else for reasons of cost-effectiveness and keeping their best stuff stealthy. They usually do the latter that I see, even NSA per Snowden leaks.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m sure you and others on your side will continue handing them your source, protocols, exact configurations, and so on to enable them to smash it. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll use the reference implementation without any changes so one attack affects you along with hundreds of thousands to millions.<p>However, anyone that wants enemies to work for their system should take my approach as it <i>provably</i> increases their difficulty so much that almost all of them will leave you alone or try other attack vectors. This strategy should be applied from ISA to OS to client & server software. And if you have holistic security, you&#x27;ll prevent or eventually detect most of their other attacks, too. Worst case, one or two of the elite groups get in while you&#x27;re still safe from the others (esp most damaging). <i>Still</i> better than the &quot;give it all to all of them&quot; approach to security you&#x27;re endorsing.",1446223291

So you only really <i>need</i> a transaction for the document itself.  Other documents could be inserted/updated at the same time without creating a conflict.  That&#x27;s the theory, at least.

Even after we’ve made the Earth too hot and polluted for humans, it still won’t be as bad as Mars. At least there’s plenty of water here, and the atmosphere won’t make your head explode.”<p>Kid has a good head on her shoulders. She sounds like an engineer.<p>I grew up dreaming about humanity exploring space. I majored in aerospace engineering in college. It was incredibly educational--it taught me we&#x27;re not going to Mars. Not in my lifetime, probably not in the lifetime of any of my descendants who still remember my name. It would be fantastically expensive and there would be no point. There are no resources out there that would justify the kind of economic investment necessary. Committing that money here on Earth would be transformative far beyond what it could be if spent on Mars.<p>Moreover, the technology has plateaued, leaving us with wildly unfavorable physical realities. You know how progress in CPUs has stalled? How the last several generations of Intel processors hasn&#x27;t really gotten faster, and all the focus is on making them cheaper and more power efficient? That happened to aerospace technology around 1970. Now we spend billions of dollars to eke out 0.5% gains in efficiency.",1446222591

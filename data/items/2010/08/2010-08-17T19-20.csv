The hardware of the cell was ready and waiting. So Venter and his team rewrote an old program and gave it a spin. Nice.<p>This is more likely a lack of understanding on my part, but I'm not sure where epigenetics comes into it? The majority of the cell components - i.e. all the organelles, chemicals, etc - were already present and arranged in the 'surrogate' cell. So all the 'epigenetic' stuff was already in place. But please correct me if I'm wrong.<p>Not so sure about the random splicing part, either.

Quantum interactions happen in all matter that we observe, so they happen in the brain. There is not that much more to it.

Our poor people can go to a building where they have free books for anyone, and more magic boxes with which they can look up any piece of information they want, for free.  Our poor people can walk into a supermarket and buy fresh fruit year round.  (If they have kids, the government will even give them coupons)  Our poor people have another magic box that receives 24-hour moving pictures of news, movies, entertainment, and educational programming.  Many of our poor people have a metal box that you pour gasoline in and it moves by itself much faster than a horse can gallop.  When our poor get sick, they can go to the emergency room and get doctors for free (the rich people's insurance and the rich tax-payers foot the bill).<p>In a third-world country poor people wonder if they are going to have food today.

For the interpreter to substantially reduce the size of the DNA needed to encode a program to build an intelligent system, that interpreter needs to be optimized to reduce the complexity of such programs. However, as far as we can tell, ribosomes and protein folding work exactly the same way in nearly all living cells, from snottites to kelp.  It isn't plausible to suggest that each Salmonella cell contains hundreds of megabytes of information that's optimized for producing intelligent systems.  Even if Salmonella contains hundreds of megabytes of information, it would amount to a proof of creationism if that information were optimized to simplify the expression of brain designs.  So the size of the interpreter is irrelevant.<p>2. DNA is not just interpreted; it's compiled into cells. The DNA of a cell contains a complete program for making every peptide that is necessary to the cell from individual amino acids, and those peptides together construct all the other chemicals from a small number of simple molecules found in the environment.  So the source code for the ""interpreter"", down to the hardware level, is actually already present in the DNA.",1282072668

Before an Irreducible Complexity crackpot uses that argument: this complexity is of course not irreducible. It just takes millions of years and the reproduction of the exact mutations and variations in circumstances to reproduce it exactly. A shorter time period, different mutations and circumstances could lead to something akin to this amount of complexity.",1282071741

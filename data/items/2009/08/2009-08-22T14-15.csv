There's a trivial rewrite using gotos that means you mostly get the same logic, but you need goto.<p>I think I've used that twice in 10 years, but when you need it, you need it. At the cost of uglying up one function you can clean up tens or hundreds of invocation points, each of which involves duplicate (and hard-to-factor-out without-this-trick) logic. (This <i>is</i> the trick to factoring it out.) I'll pay that gladly.",1250953116

A friend and I are going to be working on our own startup coming this fall, in this case potential funding MAY be needed before the Winter Y Combinator session starts.<p>2. Neither of us can really relocate to California at this time. It has potential in the future, but not for this coming winter.<p>If PG doesn't have any insight into something like this, does anyone else have information pertaining to something like this?<p>Thanks a lot.<p>EDIT: Since everyone seems to think that we are looking for funding right now, I will clear things up by saying that no, we are not looking for any funding at this point in time.",1250953098

- Why is this issue polarizing?
- What are exactly the laws under the community?<p>I am sorry my playful attempt to manipulate an otherwise meaningless indicator offended so many people. I would have never guessed it would. I am utterly surprised at the reactions.",1250952999

No need to burn somebody who has been contributing lots of good stuff for one silly thing.<p>After all, there are plenty of people that do dumber things than that (stop their car on the highway to take a picture of their odometer ticking over...). This was very mild in comparison. Annoying, sure. Apologize, never do it again. But to kill an account for that ?<p>There are quite a few known spammers here, they get away with it almost every day and they do on the whole a lot more damage, their accounts don't get killed either, it seems a little arbitrary.",1250952760

The only way I really find fun in sport is doing it.<p>Yay :) That's it. I could play pong all day or soccer or ride a bike or swim, it really doesn't matter. But to look at the performance of my 'national team' or so doesn't translate into a % of the same feeling of actually <i>doing</i> something.<p>If you want you can live your whole life second-hand today.",1250952516

It was aimed on the fun side.<p>At first I needed a couple down-votes. Then I felt the urge to post on a discussion (about a civil rights and the responsibilities of the press issue) and got a whole lot of karma points because of that. It was then I decided on Plan-B, which was to actively ask for down-votes.<p>As for the disruption, had the posts worked as expected, they would quickly sink to the bottom of the list. Can I be blamed someone up-voted them into the middle of the discussions? Specially when I asked the contrary in the very message?",1250952424

It's a fucking number on a fucking web site. The number doesn't fucking matter, the number on the web site doesn't fucking matter, the web site doesn't fucking matter. This is not a social experiment. It's asshattery.<p>The guidelines are basic: If you're not stupid, you don't get banned. I'd never heard of you before, but I looked at your comments. For a guy who's been here two years, you don't have a clue what this community likes and doesn't like, apparently.<p>My advice: Get a new account, one with a completely different name, and start over again. Your karma doesn't matter. From your previous posting habits, it didn't look like you were much of a karma whore anyway.",1250952100

I doubt I did more than 10 and I did so on new stories I felt would not get to the first page, aiming to reduce the disruption.<p>And the question originally posted was not visible to anyone except those who chose to see dead stories (I can't see from this account and I bet nobody here can). It was killed without so much as an answer.<p>And, BTW, this is a discussion that needs to happen. What can and can't be done and how to react to misdeeds.

Building a specific crawler for each website doesn't make sense.<p>The custom bits you need are then ones that fill the form and then extract the results. For scraping results ruby's Scrubyt is best as you can write templates for each type of page.",1201345058

That is not the case and I dont want to use an alarm clock that allowed people to wake me up to messages when they want to. Uggh, that would stink, I want to sleep until the time on my alarm clock goes off!<p>What's different here is the sound of your alarm clock. INstead of just hearing only a buzzer you hear some sorta of buzzer and then audio messages left from those you allow. THis is only heard after the alarm time you set passes... same principle as a normal alarm clock.<p>If this is clear to you cool ... though I dont understand your statement, ""Kramer would be sleep deprived""",1201344314

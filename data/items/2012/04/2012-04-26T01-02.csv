  companies from any suits where a company's actions are
  based on cyber threat information identified, obtained, or
  shared under this bill, regardless of whether that action
  otherwise violated Federal criminal law or results in
  damage or loss of life.  This broad liability protection
  not only removes a strong incentive to improving
  cybersecurity, it also potentially undermines our Nation's

The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible. And the altruistic virtues have really prevented the carrying out of this aim. Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good; and at last we have had the spectacle of men who have really studied the problem and know the life  educated men who live in the East End  coming forward and imploring the community to restrain its altruistic impulses of charity, benevolence, and the like. They do so on the ground that such charity degrades and demoralises. They are perfectly right. Charity creates a multitude of sins.<p>There is also this to be said. It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property.

I even drafted a web app to track my viewings and watchlist, and the rating idea I've liked the most is a stupidly simple boolean rating. You could call it almost anything: ""Like/Dislike,"" ""Good/Bad,"" ""Enjoyed/Didn't Enjoy,"" or even something a bit different like ""I'm glad I watched it/I wish I hadn't watched it.""",1335402288

We're exploring blending in a few other signals along the way, but we wanted to see how far we could get by discretising the pairwise comparisons in this way.<p>Once we've collapsed all pairs down to a Vector Victor, we treat matching Vector Victors as a thumbs up and non-matching as a thumbs down, take the square root of both then take the lower bound of the Wilson interval as our ranking function.<p>More questions?

It doesn't matter who or what you donate to - the act of donating right now is the indicator of whether you will donate in your lifetime.<p>If you have committed to donating your estate to charity by putting it into your will, good for you! But if you haven't already <i>committed</i> to this by putting it into your will, then you (at this point in time) reinforce the research - which is people always promise/intend to donate, but they have excuses to delay donating till some point in the distant future which result in them never donating in the end (so in this case, I'll donate my estate when I die).",1335402213

Most people don't sit down and think about what they want most and construct a plan to achieve that, so it shouldn't be surprising that they end up doing such drastically sub-optimal things as donating a lot of money to a museum when someone asks them to. It seems like a good thing to do, so they do it. They don't consider whether it's what they actually <i>most</i> prefer.",1335402197

It's the only imaginable scheme where you can treat all government-funded ecology, meteorology, clean-energy tech, and climatology research as part of a coherent but corrupt bargain (As you must to get your billions of dollars figure. I would also add that your mere seven figure fossil fuel budget is grossly underestimated.). Frankly, I don't think you actually believe it, as it's implausible rhetoric that could come straight from the fevered fantasies of Fox News and Rush Limbaugh.<p>The other is that there's group think among scientists. The idea seems to be that academics and scientists are all too often willing to get caught up in petty vendettas, battles for turf and recognition, and back scratching, instead of focusing on the angelically pure pursuit of knowledge. The issue with that is... well, there isn't an issue. It's totally true, as anyone who's spent much time in research knows. Hence the CRU emails.<p>It's a fair criticism. But science has soldiered on despite it through the centuries, and scientific institutions, even being plagued with those flaws, have consistently produced better explanations of the world than hacks-for-hire employed by Big Tobacco, Lysenkoist Communists, or the fossil fuel industry.",1335402180

My bad.<p>It may not make it better, but I think I did it because jimmyvanhalen's argument was, to me, so... Preposterous. As I understand him, he is basically arguing that if you feel that you have money to give to charity, you should give that to whomever gave you that money. I wonder what he feels about my, admittedly ridiculously small, donations to charity. Am I, too, wrong to give? Should I lower my fees and ""give"" that money to my clients instead?",1335402086
3891870,comment,3888928,3889352,1,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"The real question is of marginal productivity-per-hour.  We <i>know</i> that work-hours have a diminishing-returns point passed somewhere around 30-50 (depending on the person and the occupation and the match between them).  I think of it this way: if you really need to work more hours to get more done, only keep doing it as long as your productivity-per-hour stays the same.  That's the point where you're making a zero-sum trade of more hours for more stuff done.<p><i>However</i>, there's also another really important aspect!  If you only ever focus on working harder, anyone who works smarter can come along and beat you while working less than you.  Beating them through sheer work-ethic will <i>easily</i> push you into negative returns-per-hour, destroying you and your business through sheer desperation.<p>For example, anyone with a source-control tool will be several times more productive in software engineering than someone who didn't use one and has to manually revert his changes.  Remember, this used to <i>actually happen</i>.<p>So when you're working hard overtime, <i>watch your back!</i>  You could be competing against someone cleverer than yourself.",1335402070

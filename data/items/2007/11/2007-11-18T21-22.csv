All science is provisional, this much is true. Math, however, is a formal symbolic system for representing things in reality. 2 + 2 = 4 not because of some inner truth in math but because when we observe nature and combine 2 things and 2 things we have what we call 4 things. We could change the symbols around all day and they would still work. So math is just a generic way of talking about that which we can observe.<p>
The interesting thing happens when our symbolic system escapes that which can be observed, or when it is incomplete, say in the case of negative numbers (then rational, the imaginary, then irrational, etc.) At this point the exercise becomes one of either bringing the system of symbols to some application that has observable impact (applied physics) or changing the symbolic tools. There's nothing Bayesain about 2+2=4 -- that's the way the symbols are supposed to work.<p>
Now whenever we get ""stuck"" we have to go back and check out symbolic systems. Just like geeks build O/S as a hobby or college experiment, I imagine physics and mathematicians build calculi, or systems of symbols and rules for working with them. Wolfram came up with a great question in NKS -- what if the universe is really discrete and not continuous? In other words, when Newton created the integral he might have taken math down a path that ends up breaking when you try to put a GUT together. I think that's a helluva question, but it's above my pay grade.<p>
There was a book George Gamov wrote: 1-2-3-Infinity about the way various counting systems and numbers play together. Go read it -- it's better than this blog article.",1195421244

Biology needs lots of it because there are too many unknowns. Physics is much closer to math than to biology, and evaluating it like one does a biological experiment, to me, is perplexing. For 2 + 2 = 4, there doesn't seem to be any need for ""bits of information."" And even though the author is probably talking about hunches and intuition, the probability that a theoretical physics can go about his field thinking in hunches seems small enough... ok, maybe this statement required 27 bits of information?<p>Maybe I am missing something.",1195420493

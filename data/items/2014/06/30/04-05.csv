If your code doesn&#x27;t match the model yet, that&#x27;s fine.<p>But <i>your code</i> has invariants in it. Things like: &quot;this variable can never be nil, that variable can&quot;. These invariants can relatively easily be encoded as static types. Not doing so is just throwing away safety and documentation for virtually no benefit.<p>Other invariants are similar. Instead of documenting them or keeping them in your head, you let your compiler worry about them. And then when you break those invariants, the compiler is your friend! He helps you go and find all the other pieces of code that relied on the broken invariant, so you can fix them.<p>You say you prefer a more flexible language: But Go is extremely inflexible. It has a very primitive set of tools to do everything, clumsily. A language like Haskell, for example, lets you have Go-like coroutines and channels. But it also lets you program with software transactional memory, or use other parallelism constructs.<p>Also, the <i>inability</i> to specify invariants of your program isn&#x27;t flexibility. The ability to specify them or opt out of specifying them, which is what strong type systems give you, is.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/E...</a>",1404104160

Maybe you&#x27;d be interested:<p>&quot;The 3-finger Claw Technique&quot;  The sweetest 3 functions, ever.<p><pre><code>  shout() { echo &quot;$0: $*&quot; >&2; }\n  barf() { shout &quot;$*&quot;; exit 111; }\n  safe() { &quot;$@&quot; || barf &quot;Cannot $*&quot;; }\n</code></pre>\nand always,\n exit 0<p>I use these daily, they&#x27;re extremely cross-platform friendly in any bourne-derived shell I&#x27;ve used in the last 4 years.<p><pre><code>  safexample.sh :\n  --\n  #!/bin/sh\n\n  shout() { echo &quot;$0: $*&quot; >&2; }\n  barf() { shout &quot;$*&quot;; exit 111; }\n  safe() { &quot;$@&quot; || barf &quot;cannot $*&quot;; }\n\n  # consider the following lines\n  safe cd /some/dir\n  safe tar xzvfp /my/big/tarball.tbz\n\n  exit 0\n  --\n</code></pre>\nIn the above example, using &#x27;safe&#x27; suddenly gives the user the following special powers:<p>1. if `/some/dir` does not exist, the script will safely exit before that un-tarring does any damage.<p>2. the actual &#x27;directory does not exist&#x27; will return to stderr for the script, (as opposed to just telling us the useless fact that the enclosing script failed).\nNow bourne shell starts behaving like a modern language!  (ala Python/Ruby tracebacks, Perl errors, etc…)<p>Additionally, if you &#x27;exit 0&#x27; at the end, you can run non-safe operations, and always be guaranteed that if the shell exits, it was &#x27;complete&#x27;.\nAn example:<p><pre><code>  # consider the following lines\n  safe cd /some/dir\n  tar xzvfp /my/big/tarball.tbz\n\n</code></pre>\nNow, safe was removed from the un-tar command, right?  So, imaging tarballs created by people using a Mac (with HFS+ and some filesystem-specific sticky bit somewhere in the filesystem which was tar&#x27;d up). Now, you un-tar it on some <i>BSD or other </i>NIX box, and tar complains as it goes- and exits non-zero.  One way to handle this, is to consider the tar &#x27;reliable&#x27;, and not use safe for it.<p>Now, if we continue to be conscious of this simple safe/notsafe distinction with these scripts, they can be called by other safe scripts- and behave just like any respectable UNIX program!<p>Now, consider this crontab entry:<p><pre><code>  1       3       *       *       *       someuser flock -k /tmp/safexample.lock /path/to/safexample.sh\n</code></pre>\nIf it fails, (for bad perms, no tarball to unpack, etc…)  cron will actually have a reasonable message to email/log on failure!<p>Thanks to the noble efforts of the Clan of the White Lotus, these 3 functions originate during the late thirteenth century.  The original author, William Baxter, explained that these three functions took 15 years to boil down to what they are- I believe that after mercilessly abusing them for several years myself…<p>Below is another example with more bits.<p><pre><code>  #!/bin/sh\n\n  shout() { echo &quot;$0: $*&quot; >&2; }\n  barf() { shout &quot;$*&quot;; exit 111; }\n  safe() { &quot;$@&quot; || barf &quot;cannot $*&quot;; }\n\n  for i in &quot;before $@ after&quot;\n  do\n   echo &quot;arg <$i>&quot;\n  done\n\n  for i in &quot;before $* after&quot;\n  do\n   echo &quot;arg <$i>&quot;\n  done\n\n  safe echo &quot;this is ok&quot;\n  safe echo &quot;this is ok, too&quot; || safe echo &quot;so is this&quot;\n  safe bad_echo &quot;this is bad&quot;\n\n  exit 0</code></pre>",1404103934

7963649,comment,7961842,7962591,2,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"> We have the same problem with LTE networks today.<p>Yes and no. Over the air bandwidth is a very very limited resource to what can be delivered by fiber and coax.<p>Which means that the only way LTE could be used to send the World Cup to you is by some sort of multicast that would simultaneously send the same content to many smartphones at once. That would be of great interest to many people.<p>But the laws of physics, as presented by Claude Shannon [1] back in 1948, and building on earlier work by people like Nyquist, say that in a &quot;noisy&quot; channel there is a finite limit to how much data can be sent. That precludes everyone being able to simultaneously receive different content over the &quot;limited spectrum&quot; allocated to LTE.<p>I say &quot;limited spectrum&quot; because the FCC has been allowing more and more of the old TV spectrum to be used for wireless. But it&#x27;s still insignificant compared to what can be easily pushed over glass fiber.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem</a>",1404101208

(though I&#x27;d quibble with s/sometimes/usually/)<p>To reply to my siblings:<p>HTTP is in practice a great transport protocol, because of the world we live in.  That&#x27;s an affront to ivory tower engineering (my favorite kind), but it&#x27;s a lot better than failure to ship (or shipping something that only works under non-existent conditions).<p>And RPC needs some kind of container protocol, and SOAP is one possibility, sure.  Keep it the hell away from ME, but it&#x27;s one option.  The sane option is to do just what all these so-called RESTful services actually do (modulo not using GET when you should POST), with pleasant-but-not-dogmatic URIs, and JSON, and so forth, and just stop calling it REST, because it&#x27;s not REST at all.  Or call it whatever you like, but get used to endless trolling from pedants like me.<p>Aside from the bad HTTP verb choice, isn&#x27;t TFA a pretty reasonable API implementation?<p>Of course, as sillysaurus noted....  TFA doesn&#x27;t call it RESTful at all... that was just the HN headline.  Oh how we&#x27;ve been trolled.",1404101015

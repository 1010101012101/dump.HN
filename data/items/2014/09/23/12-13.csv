8355057,comment,8352580,8354451,4,0,vacri,,,"Why is it okay to use violence (libertarian definition of) to protect private property rights, but not to protect public property rights? To take a concept from a libertarian elsewhere in the thread: why is the private individual &#x27;magic&#x27; and the public not?<p>This is the irony of libertarianism: &quot;Freedom for everyone, but I get to keep all my goodies!&quot;. It&#x27;s not actually freedom for everyone; it enshrines privilege with the people who already have a lot of wealth. It works <i>against</i> levelling the playing field and <i>against</i> people advancing by merit. If you&#x27;re born into wealth, you&#x27;re protected by libertarianism - you&#x27;ll get better schooling, better networking, better secret-handshake memberships. If you&#x27;re born into poverty, libertarianism handwaves and mutters something about charity (which is always amusing, because private charities have never amounted to anything like public welfare), but really doesn&#x27;t care about helping you improve yourself, giving you the tools to become wealthier. The poor don&#x27;t have private property, so libertarianism flips them the finger. If the poor get shafted by someone&#x27;s actions, the libertarian answer is &quot;take them to (the skeletal remains of) the court system&quot;, something which the poor cannot leverage at all. Factory spewing toxic smoke into your house? Take them to court... oh, you can&#x27;t afford a lawyer, or at least one that stands a chance. Pity - there are no regulations on air pollution, because that curtails &#x27;freedom&#x27; and is &#x27;big government&#x27; and so the supposed answer instead is &#x27;take them to court&#x27;.<p>I watched your second video. It&#x27;s funny that the creator gave libertarianism a great loophole: &quot;Oh, wars of conquest make it alright if the losers have all been killed&quot;. It&#x27;s basically hand-waving away the indicated moral issues about taking things by force and translated means &quot;I get to keep my stuff&quot;. It&#x27;s a bad video full of leading statements and bad assumptions, though it does have nice production values. The entire video frames libertarianism as a mechanism to keep your material goods all to yourself - unsurprising, really, since this is what really underpins the philosophy.<p>Fundamentally, libertarianism is about people who want to maintain their social privileges and wealth, and not actually about fair opportunity. It&#x27;s an incredibly selfish philosophy, but it&#x27;s wrapped in attractive-sounding rhetoric. In any case, to answer the libertarian question &quot;Why should I help anyone else <i>at all</i>?&quot;(paraphrased, but ridiculously clear on every discussion regarding tax), the answer is basically &quot;Because you&#x27;re human, and humans are social animals that rely on each other; they are not self-sufficient without extreme effort&quot;.",1411476303

In the absence of other outside factors each trade in isolation is a zero sum game, that is 1 counter party will make money on the trade while another loses (at least in the form of opportunity cost).  In this adversarial encounter it is expected and encouraged for all counter parties to strive for unfair advantages.  Some do this by using vast swaths of overworked and underpaid ivy league grads to do market research for them.  Some do this by using massive amounts of leverage others do it by being fast, some use illegally obtained proprietary information and still others do it via mobbed up boiler rooms.  Some of that unfair advantage we have deemed illegal and others we have deemed legal.  The point is, the existence of an advantage in a trade is a necessary condition for the market to operate correctly, not evidence of it being rigged.<p>You will notice that the &quot;big&quot; players in HFT are much smaller than the people they are taking advantage of, the giant hedge funds.

I&#x27;ve claimed it gets enough right enough that a lot of people will be entirely unwilling to give up those advantages and return to something that for many of us is now an inferior solution, just because there are things about Systemd we may not agree with.<p>For my part, I agree that binary logs was not necessary, though I&#x27;ve yet to encounter any issues with it, and journald certainly does provide a lot of functionality that makes it more pleasant to deal with logs than before. All of that could have been achieved while retaining text logs, though. But at the same time, it is still trivial to log to text files by telling journald to log to syslog if that matters to you.<p>Other things I <i>do</i> care about include getting rid of init scripts - that is a persistent source of problems. I&#x27;m inclined to believe not a single one of them are bug free, though that&#x27;s probably a <i>bit</i> uncharitable. Unit files helps. So does cgroup containment to rid us of the abomination that is the need to rely on pid-files and hope that works reliably (it doesn&#x27;t, since pretty much nobody are through enough when writing init scripts). Other things include better recoverability in cases where critical processes gets killed, and well thought out handling of early stage logging. And things like systemd-cgtop and systemd-cgls are nice.<p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll eventually get solutions that split more of this functionality out into more cleanly separate components, and that&#x27;ll be great, but until then I&#x27;m happy to stay with systemd.<p>As for the problems you ran into, that sucks, but any large change like this will have painful teething problems and they&#x27;re not a good basis for judging whether it&#x27;s a good long term solution - I&#x27;ve had plenty of boot failures caused by problems with init scripts as well.<p>Boot time is a long way down the list of benefits for me too - most of our servers have uptimes measured in years, and even my home laptop usually goes a month or two between reboots.",1411473973

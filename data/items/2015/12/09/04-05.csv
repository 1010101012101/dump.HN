They&#x27;ve been profitable since 2005 so they&#x27;ve been doing something right.<p>Point being, unless you want to call gamification design, their success was far more based on engineering and business. Like you said it wasn&#x27;t an original idea, but they could relativly quickly produce a clone of something and monetize.

[Not so rightwing by american standards].<p>~1000€ is what ultra leftwing party&#x27;s youth group proposes.\n~600€ is what the Green leftist party proposes<p>The right wing parties talks about creating motivation for people to get to work with  the basic income. A newspaper supporting prime minister party&#x27;s talk about either partial basic income of 550€ with it replacing most benefits or full basic income of 800€ with absolute cutting of other benefits.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see most is basic income combined with true flat tax. No tax deductions, minimal bureaucracy.\nIf we are going to pay certain minimal support to everyone to keep them from going too desperate, we could as well pay it to everyone and then start taxing from first euro earned with the flat percentage.<p>Instead of current system in which people send lots of separate applications for different benefits and then people paid by government has to work. And when you get raise you probably need to get new tax form from tax office to give your employer.<p>What well made basic income should give is instead of having long plateau after the minimum everyone is guaranteed to get one way or other, is a way for everyone to get that minimal guaranteed all the time and any marginal employment would increase income over that. And most of the cost would be got from reducing number of government employees required to handle it. \nEveryone doing the math should consider that only real cost of basic income is when someone earns less than (1/taxrate)*basic income and more than what government currently gives to poor. And it eliminates cost of MANY government jobs handling papers for benefits, and makes easier to take a job for a day or two or week or two because you cannot loose benefits for it. Or loose benefits for starting your own business.",1449637045

I&#x27;m disappointed I had to make an analogy like this to show the flawed logic that led to that silly idealised simplified math that ignores reality.  I have already shown that the effects of hiring a different CEO are unpredictable.<p>The support of having is stronger than you suggest.  The study showed a significant negative association between firm performance and pay disparity in the Korean companies as well, from a separate study where more financial information is required to be disclosed.<p>I will also say that the CEO compensation is reasonable in most companies, it is just that after about the 8th decile performance starts decreasing and risk increases.  The real problem seems to be the more extreme CEO to average employee pay ratios.<p><i>Can you think of another reason why banks with lots of mortgage officers might have performed worse during the crisis?</i><p>A larger pay gap in the executive ranks promotes greater risk-taking.<p>By the way, there was the highest CEO compensation compared to employee compensation just before the GFC hit.<p><i>...I encourage you to invest in companies with CEOs who are perceived as being terrible.</i><p>I would say that is terrible advice that has nothing to do with the conversation, as we were discussing pay ratios.",1449636923

Law & Order: SVU can be described as a procedural; South Park cannot, unless you&#x27;re using a very very loose definition of the term.<p>If you&#x27;re looking at this in terms of nested sets or categories:<p>- Scripted vs. Nonscripted<p>- Comedy vs. Drama (usually also means half-hour vs. hour)<p>- Episodic (every episode is self-contained) vs. Serialized (the show follows an overall, evolving storyline that builds each episode)<p>- Subgenre<p>So a show like L&O: SVU would be a scripted, one-hour drama in the crime procedural subgenre. (We could also describe the show as episodic, but given that all procedurals are episodic, this would be redundant.)<p>South Park is a scripted, half-hour comedy in the animation subgenre that typically follows an episodic format, with occasional serialized story arcs spanning multiple episodes (and in the case of this season, the whole season).",1449634600

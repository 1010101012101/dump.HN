While I often wish they could all just get along, the fact that two incredibly capable companies (and heck, Microsoft as well now) are fighting it out hammer and tongs in a pretty flat playing field is ridiculously awesome. Imagine if the same level of competition had existed between Apple and Microsoft between 1985 and 2000.<p>Consider that we&#x27;re getting smaller, faster, lower powered, and often cheaper devices with more features every year. We got this level of progress in PC hardware for a while (1990-2003 or so) but software progressed far more slowly. Right now, literally everything is up for grabs, and everyone is benefiting.",1385056785

So Bradley Terry is used in Psychology studies for that reason. (Eventually, you stop taking data).<p>Elo on the other hand, is mathematically equivalent to Bradley-Terry except with infinite data. Elo allows you to incrementally &quot;add data&quot; to an existing Bradley-Terry-esque model and make it more accurate.<p>BTW: Elo has been superceeded by superior models today, but all (good) ranking models are &quot;interval properties&quot; that have been derived from the Bradley Terry model from Psychology research.<p>See TrueSkill (which is based on Gaussian Curves, so they aren&#x27;t technically Bradley-Terry but instead the Thurstone scale), Glicko, and Glicko2.",1385056710

Any time someone switches platforms, they will undoubtedly be more prone to identify quirks and missing features in the new platform than everyday users.<p>If companies (be it Apple or Google) want users to switch to their platform from their competitors, it&#x27;s critical for them to maintain feature-parity and push the boundaries on their strengths.  Case in point: Apple adding notifications and copy&paste to the iPhone.  Both were gripes from non-iPhone users.  But at some point, Apple had to bite the bullet to follow suit.  Whether their implementation was a success isn&#x27;t the point, but rather keeping up with the competition in feature parity.",1385056708

Lack of resources for teachers impairs the learning environment. Teaching to tests instead of engaging students in authentic inquiry kills students’ natural curiosity and innovation. Outside stimulation that distracts from learning is an inefficient use of student time, and overcrowding puts further stress on resources for teachers.<p>Educational websites are a way to ease the pain of brick-and-mortar schools. There are thousands of free or inexpensive online teaching aids that circumvent the need for major funding. Education websites like Artifacts Teach engage students in authentic inquiry and offer sustained attention, therefore improving long-term learning and positively impacting testing. An unlimited number of students can be served from a single educational website making overcrowding a non-issue.",1385056639

Occasionally the entire team can break into talking in the open office area but this should only be done if the entire team is participating. If the entire team isn&#x27;t participating then communication should be handled in a chat (preferably) or in a conference room.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to build software in an open office where people are constantly talking then I&#x27;m sorry, good work will not get done.

Raising VC funding is not counter to many of those goals, but it&#x27;s not the only (or best) path to them in most cases.",1385056192

In deciding how much money to hold onto, people and businesses make a trade off between liquidity and the cost inflation imposes on them of holding a given quantity of money.  But if people&#x27;s expectations regarding future inflation change, that tradeoff changes in a positive feedback cycle.  If people expect more inflation then they&#x27;ll want to hold less money than otherwise and in most cases this will cause more inflation[1].  If people expect less inflation than previously they&#x27;ll now want to hold more money, causing further deflation.<p>Now, inflation expectations <i>have</i> clearly come unanchored because the GDP deflater, the measure of inflation most relevant to this particular effect, has been stuck closer to 1% than 2% since the financial crisis and the price spread between inflation protected and normal bonds means that the people who hold most of the M1 think this is likely to continue.<p>These effects are both self-limiting, the desire for liquidity isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> strong so we only saw an 11% growth in the money supply despite inflation falling by 30%.  And the inflationary spiral will quickly (but painfully) stall out if the central bank doesn&#x27;t keep printing money to match demand.<p>Which is to say that sure, there&#x27;s more cash floating around, but it&#x27;s not just washing around it&#x27;s being stored in people&#x27;s pockets.  It might be liable to cause excess inflation if the ECB ever manages to convince people that it will be able to hit its targets in the future, but it&#x27;s not particularly benefiting France at the moment.<p>[1] In the mainstream economics sense of a rise in the price level, not the odd Austrian school definition.",1385055258

Aside from being younger, IPython is made of a combination of systems without a strong conceptual glue tying them together. Mathematica is made of a combination of systems too (kernel written in C, various external libraries in C,  Lucene search engine, etc), but the components are tied together using what I guess is now called the Wolfram language, where everything, from computations to settings to notebooks themselves, is specified in Wolfram language expressions. If you view an IPython file in a text editor you see JSON, which is different than the language used to compute. If you open a Mathematica notebook in a text editor you see a nested set of Wolfram language expressions. Mathematica grew up around that idea.<p>As a further small example, compare the prompts to the two systems:<p><pre><code>  IPython\n  In [1]: 1+2\n  Out[1]: 3\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>  Mathematica\n  In[1]:= 1+2\n  Out[1]= 3\n</code></pre>\nIn IPython, the array brackets are just a sort of notation--the assignment isn&#x27;t syntactially correct Python. But in Mathematica, you can view that prompt as assigning the value of an In list at index 1 the expression &quot;1+2&quot;.<p>That sort of consistency holds through the entire system in a way that IPython can&#x27;t match.",1385055073

What do you mean by &quot;you have money in your personal bank account?&quot; Are you saying that some of the money put in by a VC ends up in your personal bank account? If it does, it&#x27;s through a salary you withdraw from the company. VCs, or any investor, will want X seats in your board, which will also give them a say about your salary. So if you got $1M in funding, no sane board will allow you to take a $700K salary.\nYour win from the investment is that now your company has money to move faster, by hiring more talented people, buy equipment that is important to the business, pay vendors, etc. In short, to scale. You, the founder, keep a % of the company throughout this time, but you&#x27;d only see it translate to real money in the case of an acquisition/IPO/sell off. Your motivation, then, is to increase the value of the company so that % you have in the company will translate to more money in the cases I mentioned.\nAfter this long answer, I feel like I still haven&#x27;t actually answered your question because you&#x27;re probably asking about something more subtle :-)",1385054536

6775788,comment,6774631,6775619,4,0,kadabra9,,,"I know this is cliche, but I think the single most effective way to improve is to play a lot, then review your games with a player that is stronger than you and have them point out better moves you could have made, explain your thought process, etc. If you don&#x27;t have a stronger player available to look at your games (I can look at a few :) ), then just replay them yourself, look for moves where the game turned towards one player and things you could have done better. Or, plug them into a computer program and see what moves the computer suggests, and then ask yourself why the computer is suggesting them.<p>For books, I started out by reading a few books by Yasser Seirawan. Two titles I particularly found helpful are &quot;Winning Chess Strategies&quot; and &quot;Winning Chess Tactics&quot;. Seirawan is a good writer and both titles do a really good job explaining their concepts to players new to the game. Jeremy Silman wrote a book called &quot;The Amateur&#x27;s Mind&quot; which I thought was pretty good, that compares thought processes between amateurs, intermediate, and expert level players across similar positions.<p>One other idea is to simply get a book that is a collection of annotated master/grandmaster games, set up a board, make some coffee, and replay through them. Review the authors notes. Replay them again. Get a sense for the openings being used and the different strategies. Two good collections are &quot;The Mammoth Book of Greatest Chess Games&quot; by Burgess and &quot;The Most Instructive Chess Games Played&quot; (can&#x27;t remember author).<p>Chess.com is a great free place to play. They have free tournaments and games online, you can get a rating, track your progress, etc. If you do a paid membership, you get access to videos, tutorials etc. I just use the free membership, so I can&#x27;t comment as to how good these videos are, but at least to me they look solid.<p>Good luck.

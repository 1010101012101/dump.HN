They're too young yet to have a concept of a map (computer or otherwise), but I want them to be able to say look at Calfornia, where we live, and take the time to look at each and every state in between to say the State of Maine. With a very large map you get much more of a feel for the position of states relative to one another (or countries for that matter) and then you can also zoom in (get closer) and see what lies within.<p>Yes, it is very cool in particular to do that on an iPad. But the entire feel is lost. If one looks at the whole US at once, most of the details are lost.

SPAM is ""unsolicited bulk email"", so if you sent bulk mail to people that didn't want it, you're a spammer.  Nobody cares so much about your service as to want to read an email about it -- people just don't like getting advertising in their email, and very few people would ever consent to be emailed explicitly.

One half did immeasurably better than the other half. Those are the facts.</i><p>That fact doesn't validate Austrian-school-thinking — merely that it worked better than Soviet central-planning given the global political and economic environment at the time, which says <i>almost nothing</i>. And even if you're arguing merely in favor of increased economic liberalization, this comparison still holds no value because <i>social democracy has nothing to do with central planning</i>! The points don't even exist along a linear axis — they are apples and oranges. The debate all over the world right now is about how best to implement social democracy, and comparing those two extreme economic philosophies doesn't contribute anything at all. To pretend it does is disingenuous.<p>The worst thing about right-wing followers of Austrian school thinking is that they refuse to consider the social outcomes when ""market freedom"" is taken too far; they are bent on destroying society as it exists and recreating a weak image of it inside their economic framework. Even von Hayek himself acknowledged the need for a basic social support system. This type of thinking is highly simplified, almost always ideologically-applied, and extremely toxic to our social fabric.",1325567078

3418687,comment,3414526,3417005,0,0,jrockway,,,"Python doesn't have traits/roles, so it's hard to give a good example.  You should build classes by composing them from smaller pieces of classes.  There are two good ways to do this; delegation and role-based composition.  Delegation is where you pass the constructor of your class an instance of another class, and your ""foo"" method becomes an alias to that instance's foo method.  This allows you to do the same interfaces/roles as the object you're ""wrapping"", but still lets you customize the behavior of each method call you choose to delegate.  (The Law of Demeter protects you from other callers touching the non-delegated methods.)<p>Roles let you implement pieces of classes without being a full class yourself.  A classic example is a ""Comparable"" role, that requires the consumer to implement a ""cmp"" function, and then provides lt, gt, and eq implemented in terms of ""cmp"".  You mix this into your class that does cmp, and now it gets lt, gt, and eq for free.  You also get the security of knowing that you're calling the right method; duck typing will treat a tree's bark and a dog's bark as the same actions, while roles will let you determine whether you have an object with a wooden outer layer, or an object that can talk like a dog.<p>Python's philosophy doesn't seem to push delegation or composition, so we use inheritance in the above example to stick with Python programmer's expectations.  Just beware of invoking the wrong type of bark; duck typing is flexible, but it ain't safe.",1325567022

Now, not so much.<p>Pegobry, your point is well taken; I'm an engineer myself, and I agree -- as Web frameworks mature, and engineering/development patterns level off, design becomes the differentiating factor.  And yes, provided your numbers are correct, Tumblr currently appears to be ""winning.""  Not sure whether the latter really matters, or whether it even supports the former at all, but it's a concept with which I happen to agree.<p>Your mistake was to post the article here, primarily since you wrote it yourself.

I can see it being a big deal for email, but for organic traffic I'm not convinced.  Most domain squatters don't have anything up on the site, have a adsense landing page or something extremely outdated.  Assuming your site has even mild success, your search engine ranking will be much, much higher.  Sadly, the email issue is probably a show-stopper.<p>Also, I don't think a lot of people actually type the domain in the address bar.  They're either clicking a link or searching.<p>The real question here is, can you pull a dropbox?  Trademark the name, launch your site, get popular, then just take away the .com if the owner somehow infringes on your mark.  Is this a valid precedent or do you have to have boat-loads of cash to actually make this work?<p>In any case, it's probably just easier to choose a different name.  I just emailed someone yesterday about a .com domain name and he wanted $20k.  Seems like the dropbox method might be easier.",1263909314

He went out to the flea market and bought bags of parts and dumped them on the overhead projector and said, with some drama, ""you can build a radio out of these"".<p>He gave an illustration of an application of such technology for his neighborhood.  The street near a school had a speed limit that was often exceeded.  He wanted to find a way to bring the attention of this to the city.  Purchasing some parts from Ramsey Electronics, he built a radar gun (using licensed ham radio frequencies), attached it to a post near the street, connected the output to a macintosh, and delivered plots of the speed of cars over a period of time.  The city then put speed bumps there, making it a safer street.",1263909263

1062083,comment,1062031,1062031,0,0,SlyShy,,,"As DavidSJ noted, typing in Dvorak doesn't make programming any easier.

I've been using plain Dvorak, because I didn't learn about the alternatives in time. I don't think the switch has made much difference either way.<p>Oddly enough, the change that has caused the greatest increase in typing speed for me was starting to use my netbook keyboard. Most people will find this insane, but the smaller keyboard decreases finger travel, so as long as your fingers are small enough to continue typing with precision it ends up being a plus.<p>I think it's pretty meaningless to worry about typing speed being a productivity problem while programming. I can type at 120 wpm, but only 85 wpm while typing composed English, and about 35 wpm typing code. It's much more about brain latency. :)",1263909078

Transactions reported fraudulent should be automatically reversed, unless the bank can provide proof (satisfying the standards expected in civil courts) that the customer was at fault.<p>As an example, this was largely the case with transactions not involving PINs (signed-for purchases). Recent introduction of EMV (chip-and-pin cards) was really done to shift responsibility for such transactions back onto the customers and reduce banks' losses.<p>This is also the case with stolen cards (in the UK and Ireland, at least): losses related to such cases are covered by the bank, even for losses occurring before the card was reported stolen. This is the reason banks implement various pattern-matching techniques to try and detect such transactions as soon as possible.",1263908943

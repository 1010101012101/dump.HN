Two months ago they shut down my account because they think I'm high risk. I've had my Chase account frauded twice too (I know, I AM high risk) and Chase hasn't shut down my account.<p>IMO Paypal swung quickly from being too sloppy to being too conservative. The fraud they missed a few years ago was easy to catch - it was from sketchy sites and the products were being shipped to PO boxes nowhere close to where I live. Paypal is playing a dangerous game now by shutting down people's accounts because their strength comes from a network effect within a potential monopoly (unlike Chase); every person they ban from paypal removes the legitimacy of their service a little.<p>BTW Paypal's fraud team was only built up to a solid point in the past 3-4 years.

4483950,comment,4481436,4481436,1,0,sebg,,,"Hey Diligu friends - Great job launching something especially in the music business space.<p>Some feedback:<p>1. The head line ""we f*cking love music"" is not about me the user it's about you the company.  While it's nice to know it doesn't tell anything about the website.<p>2. Some spacing between the picture, the ""Want to ..."" and the list of songs would help give the elements some breathing room.<p>3. On the top bar on the front page you have ""Start"", ""Join Today"" and ""Sign In"".  The ""Start"" link just takes me back to the front page.  This was confusing as I thought that ""Start"" and ""Join Today"" were actually the same thing.<p>4. I like the idea though dislike the people you are going to charge.  Minor artists rarely have extra funds to through around on marketing that is not directly tied to concerts, t-shirts, stickers, etc.  Here you are asking minor artists to pay for people they want to reach without actually (at least where I could see) trying to convince me as a minor artist that a) you have enough people for me to care, b) that they are worth paying, and c) that they really are worth 10 cents per user.<p>5. Outside of the three free songs on the front page - it's not clear to me that is has anything to do with microblogging or music-discovery or that as an artist that I can buy audiences.<p>6. If it is a microblogging website, I'd love to browse users or artists without having to sign up/in with twitter and/or facebook.<p>7. Using uservoice - i'm not always a fan of this because I clicked on it and all I saw were problems that people had with your service that I hadn't even thought about.  Note - this isn't to say that you should hide the problems.<p>8. In the footer you link to API and then when I click into it you tell me that you don't have anything ready and that I should contact you to tell you what I want.  Perhaps it's better to not say anything until you actually have it?  Otherwise it really raises expectations and makes the product feel incomplete.<p>9. In the footer you also have twitter (blog).  For me these are two very different things so I was surprised that they went to the same place.  In a similar point to the API, if you don't have a blog, that's cool - just don't put it so that expectations are kept on the right things.<p>10. If you are going to sell audiences, are you going to provide some money back to users?<p>11. I tried to sign up using twitter.  What you want to do with my twitter account is pretty crazy - especially ""Update your profile.""  There is no way that I would ever sign up for a service has the ability to change my twitter profile.  Also, tweeting out for me is my boundary line.  Also somewhat shocking is following new people for me.  Perhaps I haven't been using all the new music startups, but for a website that i'm supposed to be using to discover new music, these seem like pretty harsh consequences for signing up.<p>12. So I signed up/in anyway to give feedback.  Once I sign up you then ask me to come up with a user name.  Couldn't you have used my twitter account?  This extra step doesn't add anything to your service (haven't seen what this user account will be used for or what it means) so it's just another step that would make me want to close the browser.<p>13. I selected a genre ""indie"" and then couldn't figure out how to move to the next steps.  I finally realized after clicking on a ton of stuff that I had to click on something that looks like a pasta shell.  When I hover over it the eye opens and it says follow.  This is really hard to understand and doesn't tell me what to do.<p>14. If I click on indie / electro / pop user ""Peng"" is at the top of the list for all of them.  If I click sequentially, I don't actually see the list of people change so it makes it look like these are the only people that I'll be able to follow.  perhaps make this random so at least it makes it look like there's all type of users.<p>15. I'm not entirely sure why I want to follow people or how it will make my life awesome.  Most of the text talks about Diligu not why following people will make my life awesome.<p>16. I followed user ""peng"", then I go to step two and you ask for more credentials to more services?  Here is where I stopped.  This is way too hard and way too many steps to jump through before I can even start enjoying the service.<p>17. I skipped the rest of the steps and the first thing I see when I finally get in is a huge ad telling me to give you my facebook credentials so that it can find new friends for me.  So far i've spend like 10 minutes trying to get into the website and no value has been provided to me yet.<p>I like the idea of a twitter where the followers I can follow are based exclusively on their musical tastes.  However, I think you have to rethink your onboarding process and how to add value to the user right off of the bat.<p>Good luck and keep us updated!",1346936715
4483949,comment,4483710,4483862,30,0,dangrossman,,,"Considering they have a quarter billion active users, a ""horror story"" once or twice a month is an amazingly, amazingly low dissatisfaction rate. I don't think PayPal is actually causing <i>that</i> many merchants much trouble. It just appears that way, because:<p>* At most merchant services providers, underwriting happens up front: you have to describe your business, what you're selling, expected volume, etc. on an application, and go back and forth with the bank, before you are allowed to accept credit cards. PayPal lets you start immediately, and only gets the information from you once you've started transacting some meaningful volume. So the risk problems are weeded out with other processors right at the start, where with PayPal it can come up suddenly.<p>* These people have never even thought about underwriting and risk assessment. They treat PayPal as if it's a consumer service, when PayPal has to treat it seriously -- they're essentially making a rolling loan in the amount of 6 months of your transaction volume -- because if you disappear, they're on the hook for the chargebacks for all your past payments. People do stuff no other processor would let them do -- like taking massive donations with no prior approval, selling pre-orders to software that hasn't been written yet -- and PayPal isn't OK with it either once they find out.<p>* PayPal merchants are disproportionately more often individuals than actual businesses compared to what other processors see... because it's so easy to open an account, and everyone that's used eBay already has one.<p>* Because the merchants are individuals, and have no experience with underwriting at other processors, and have previously used accounts suddenly limited or frozen, they're confused and surprised. Add to that customer service that won't really tell you much once an account's been closed, and you end up with a couple really angry people a month: cue blog post about how PayPal is evil and if only it were a bank, they couldn't do this.",1346936712

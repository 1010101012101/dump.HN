I expect that will share the same kind of perspective enriching attribute of learning logic, array or functional paradigms. While it&#x27;s certainly not the first language to support substructural types, it looks the only one with a decent chance of developing a meaningful ecosystem.<p><i>The linear logic of J.-Y. Girard suggests a new type system for functional languages, one which supports operations that ``change the world&#x27;&#x27;. Values belonging to a linear type must be used exactly once: like the world, they cannot be duplicated or destroyed. Such values require no reference counting or garbage collection, and safely admit destructive array update</i><p><a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/linear-logic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/linear-logic.htm...</a><p>An interesting bit of trivia about linear types is they are in some sense the closest thing to programming a quantum computer this side of qubits (where no cloning dictates qubit variables can only be used once in a function term).",1376020751

Up 655% in the last 10 years and 17,000% since inception.&quot;<p>Only if you sold the stock at that price.<p>OK, Amazon is clearly not Pets.com.  It has growing revenues and some profits.<p>But Amazon famously has a higher P/E than many other technology and Internet companies.  This is only justified if Amazon has a clear path to greater profits and dividends than those other companies in its future.  The article points out its not clear what this path for Amazon might look like.<p>This also makes me think of Facebook.  As we waited for Facebook to go public, many speculated that Facebook was still in the stage of rapid growth, and it didn&#x27;t matter that revenue and profits were low because eventually huge profits were guaranteed with so many users.  Facebook is a profitable company, but since it&#x27;s gone public, revenue and profits haven&#x27;t grown the way people thought, and the stock is still below its IPO price.<p>My point is lots of users, lots of customers, and lots of revenue are necessary preconditions for a company to be worth investing in.  But at some point, growing profits has to be a concern, too.<p>Maybe the best way I can phrase it:  Do you want to be Apple or Amazon?  Apple found a path to high profit margins, high growth, and a business generating lots of cash, and now they are both buying back stock and paying dividends to share holders.  With Amazon, the profits, cash, and dividends seem always in the future, yet Amazon has usually had a higher P/E than Apple.  Which do you think is the better model?",1376020727

You are not required to identify yourself to any police officer just because he asks, and if he asks without reasonable suspicion or probable cause (it depends on the state which one is the threshold), and you refuse to state your name, then he can not arrest you for that sole reason. If he attempts to do so, it is false arrest, and you have the right under the law, upheld by the supreme court, to use any necessary force to resist illegal arrest.</i><p>What constitutes whether a police officer has the right to &quot;stop and identify&quot; someone varies quite widely from state to state[1]. Before attempting to do so, it&#x27;s a good idea to know the explicit details for the current state one is residing.<p>Some states actually have claims that you <i>must</i> identify yourself when stopped if the police officer asks.

In all but Rhode Island, the consideration arises in the context of loitering or prowling.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Virginia makes it a nonjailable misdemeanor to refuse to identify oneself to a conservator of the peace when one is at the scene of a breach of the peace witnessed by that conservator.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes#Obligation_to_identify"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_and_identify_statutes#Obli...</a>",1376020581

Instead, it&#x27;ll have the ability to read electrical signals from a camera and understand the changing patterns in them, including the presence of faces. This ability to understand changing patterns would be due to &quot;simpler&quot; rules than the rules specifically designed to understand faces.<p>So yes, a general purpose learning algorithm, using the correct paradigm, would learn to think in a way as powerful as we do. And it&#x27;ll do so in a way that its programmers would never be able to predict.<p>In the same vein, I would say that Google search results is an emerging phenomena, albeit not quite as interesting as general purpose intelligence. This is because it&#x27;s intractable to predict what Google will return for certain queries, even if we know all of its rules. Keep in mind that there are degrees of emergence, it&#x27;s not black and white.

You just have to design your allocator right to allow the card marking to work.<p>In practice I think that the biggest problems are compiler related and affect both Go and Rust. Go and Rust both use conservative GC on the stack and as a result they take a lot of shortcuts. For example, LLVM (and GCC as far as I&#x27;m aware, though someone like DannyBee may correct me here) loses the distinction between integers and pointers by the time they get to the machine instruction level, which makes a lot of optimizations easier to implement but also making it impossible to generate precise stack maps. Fixing this would be a lot of hard work. It&#x27;s probably easier in the Plan 9 compilers, of course, though I suspect it&#x27;s still going to be a lot of hard work.",1376018386

Drinking in public? Drugs? Prostitution?<p>Trespassing is not breaking and entering, which is reasonable as an imprisonable offense. Shouldn&#x27;t trespassing be an infraction with a modest fine?<p>Back to that food item she took from Whole Foods. In a fabulously wealthy nation, how is it that she has come to need to shoplift food to be able to eat. Is that not a failure of the society as a whole?<p>The proposed answer in the article is to have them committed by some sort of court order and place them indefinitely in a &quot;secure nursing home&quot; facility with an ankle bracelet. That&#x27;s likely to be more costly than prison since it requires round the clock medical care, and is no better than a prison since they are locked up.<p>I propose a better solution. Decriminalize all of these things, leave this woman alone, and save the $719,436 it cost to imprison her for minor and non-offenses.<p>The article also makes the claim, &quot;If someone decides he wants to walk around naked, or cannot give his name to a police officer, the likelihood is that he will end up in jail.&quot; If police are arresting people without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion, then it is the police that are acting illegally here. You are not required to identify yourself to any police officer just because he asks, and if he asks without reasonable suspicion or probable cause (it depends on the state which one is the threshold), and you refuse to state your name, then he can not arrest you for that sole reason. If he attempts to do so, it is false arrest, and you have the right under the law, upheld by the supreme court, to use any necessary force to resist illegal arrest.<p>Regarding walking around naked, that is permitted or tolerated in some areas such as nude beaches. There are also issues where people ask why it is that it is legal for men to go topless, yet is criminal for women to go topless? Should not the law apply equally to both men and women? That is a reasonable question and there is no answer that justifies this discrimination that is not intrinsically sexist. Is that what we want? What is so wrong with even total nudity? There is an old man in Barcelona who is well known for going about completely naked, wearing only his tattoos, pierced foreskin and often a full erection.

Here is my reply:<p>Senator,<p>Thank you for your reply; I appreciate your concern for these issues. If\nyou could find the time, I would love a reply to the below that I could\nforward on to others.<p>On Wed, Aug 07, 2013 at 02:14:55PM -0400, Senator Schumer wrote:<p>> First, there should be an open discussion and debate about them in<p>> Congress. Policies this profound should not be decided unilaterally by any<p>> administration. Second, there should be clear rules established that the<p>> government has to obey. Third, there ought to be an independent arbiter,<p>> like a judge, that makes sure these rules are being obeyed.<p>><p>> Once the arbiter makes rulings on these issues, they should be released to<p>> the public for review---so long as their release would not jeopardize our<p>> national security.<p>This is certainly a step in the right direction. However:<p><pre><code>    ``It is the sense of Congress that each decision, order, or opinion issued\n    by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign\n    Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review that includes significant\n    construction or interpretation of section 501 or section 702 of the \n    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861 and 1881a)\n    should be declassified in a manner consistent with the protection of\n    national security, intelligence sources and methods, and other properly\n    classified and sensitive information.&#x27;&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nWhat oversight will ensure that the interpretation of ``a manner consistent\nwith the protection of national security [...]&#x27;&#x27; is not too broad? This law \nis entirely at the mercy of this statement; the NSA and other agencies will\nlikely try to argue quite hard that most all such information is in the \ninterest of national security and, thusly, cannot be declassified.<p>As an example, consider the case Jewel v. NSA, filed by the EFF.[1] The case\nwas for a while stalled while the NSA tried to argue the state secrets\nprivilege, which was not denied until <i>after</i> Snowden&#x27;s revelations.[2]\nWhile Judge White&#x27;s decision is certainly reassuring, such friction needs to\nbe limited to avoid a dysfunctional and terribly slow legal process.<p>That is not to say that this bill is not a step in the right direction with\nregards to exposing the FISA Court&#x27;s decisions; however, this leads to\nanother question: Why did it take this long?<p>The EFF and others have been pushing for the FISC to publish its secret\ninterpretations of FISA and the Patriot Act for quite some time.\nFurthermore, there has been extensive evidence suggesting NSA spying[3] as\noutlined in the Hepting v. AT&T and Jewel v. NSA cases; two such examples\nare [4] and [5], with the latter (Summary of Voluminous Evidence)\nparticularity damning.<p>Why did it take a whistleblower for our government to become interested in\nthis investigations to the degree that they are today? Why is it necessary\nfor a citizen to keep his government in check by his own means?<p>Regardless, thank you again for your response. I look forward to further\ndiscussion from lawmakers and, as a constituent, yourself.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/press/releases/federal-judge-allows-effs-nsa-mass-spying-case-proceed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/press/releases/federal-judge-allows-effs...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.mikegerwitz.com/2013/06/National-Uproar-A-Comprehensive-Overview-of-the-NSA-Leaks-and-Revelations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mikegerwitz.com/2013/06/National-Uproar-A-Compreh...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/file/28823"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/file/28823</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/node/72021"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/node/72021</a>",1376017785

Ive never had a paid developer account, but my impression is that people used to take the NDA a <i>lot</i> more seriously several years ago; Im not sure if its because Apple dropped the price from $500 to $99 or because I spend a lot more time around CS students, or maybe because so many more people have iPhones now, but it seems like even a lot of non-developers are finding it worth $99 a year to get prerelease iOS builds, and everyone is wildly violating the NDA.",1376017579

6183501,comment,6182374,6182374,1,0,riggins,,,"I&#x27;m not sure Amazon will ever make profits.<p>The general thesis is &#x27;they&#x27;re the low cost provider, they&#x27;re going to make a ton a profit&#x27;. This thesis is one that often leads Wall Street and investors to tears. Because there&#x27;s another factor that needs to be taken into account: is there going to be a glut of capacity.<p>Here&#x27;s the classic example. One of the managers of Buffett&#x27;s textile mills came to Buffett and told him they could invest in a new power loom that would double production for the same cost to run. Buffett&#x27;s response: that&#x27;s terrible, none of that will stick to our ribs. Buffett could see that everyone in the industry would increase capacity, there&#x27;d be a glut of product, and the industry wouldn&#x27;t capture the profits.<p>Another classic example: fiber optic. Read a research report from the late 90&#x27;s on the fiber industry if you can get your hands on one. Lot&#x27;s of comments on what a great investment Global Crossing would be because &#x27;low cost provider wins&#x27;. Of course &#x27;low cost provider&#x27; went bankrupt because there was a glut of capacity.<p>So bringing it back to Amazon, is there a glut of capacity? I&#x27;d say probably. What&#x27;s Amazon&#x27;s fundamental purpose? Matching buyers and sellers (which they do much much better than a mall). A computer basically has infinite capacity to match buyers and sellers. The warehouses are nice but when I look at the forest I question whether the profits are ever going to materialize. I see a glut of capacity and no reason why that would lessen. It&#x27;s getting easier to start an internet company, not harder.  The competition isn&#x27;t going to cede the field either. They&#x27;ll continue to put a ceiling on prices until the bitter end.",1376017491

6183489,comment,6180173,6181142,3,0,eitally,,,"Another really common scenario is that the vendor doesn&#x27;t offer an appealing pricing model based on the anticipated or intended usage of the product.  For example, lately I&#x27;ve been talking to videoconferencing system providers.  One of them has a really great feature that no one else has, but their only pricing option is per named user at roughly $800/yr.  This is completely untenable at a 45,000 person company (even if you only consider the 20,000 of those people who are knowledge workers, or even if you only consider roughly 5,000 of them who might need VC.  The problem I have is never knowing exactly who the named users should be.).  Another vendor has a similar product, and offers both named user and concurrent user pricing options.  A third vendor offers both cloud & in-room-hardware options where we can mix & match, with the advantage that hardware-based VC rooms don&#x27;t consume a user license at all, so we&#x27;d only be paying for desktop/mobile connections.  The first vendor lost a 6 figure deal just because they weren&#x27;t willing to entertain an appealing pricing model.<p>To expand on Andy&#x27;s general point, and one josh2600 made earlier, it truly pays to get to know your target&#x27;s corporate culture and bureaucracy.  One of the first questions experienced sales reps ask at the close of the second call (or whenever the first demo is) is something along the lines of &quot;what is your sales process like?&quot; or &quot;how does your department handle budgeting, and what is your fiscal calendar?&quot;<p>Oooh, before I forget, here&#x27;s another big turn-off: yes, sales reps hop between companies more than engineers, but for goodness sake PLEASE keep your CRM updated so your target doesn&#x27;t get repetitive cold calls from other reps at your company.  This doesn&#x27;t happen <i>too</i> often, but I still experience it about once a quarter and it leaves me fuming each time, especially if I already have a contractual relationship with the vendor.",1376017308

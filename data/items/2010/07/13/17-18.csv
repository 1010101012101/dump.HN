1512197,comment,1511027,1511824,0,0,lkozma,,,"I added the following correction to the article:<p>CORRECTION: as pointed out by users Adrian and Bones in the comments below and by Mark Fulton and apollo on the HN thread, I made an error in interpreting the data. The numbers given by Google for each query are not telling how frequently a query was asked, but rather, it seems, they are related to the popularity of the words and combinations of words (from the query) in a large corpus of website data. This way they are still related to how popular these words and groups of words are, however, not as queries, but as the text of websites. According to the Google Suggest help page, the suggested queries are all real queries, i.e. they have been issued in this exact form by someone, which in my opinion still makes the list below an interesting read, however my interpretation of the order as pure query frequency was wrong. I thank everyone for the feedback, and apologize for the misunderstanding. I leave the text below unedited, but consider this correction as you continue.",1279043976

I agree with everything you've said about the neighborhood - a lot of good bars, inexpensive restaurants, quick access to downtown on express buses, cheaper rents.<p>Huge downside: very difficult to get south on the freeways. There's no clear path, so you have to fight your way through city traffic.  At rush hour, this can easily add 25 aggravating minutes to your commute (and add in an extra 10-15 minutes to find parking in the inner richmond).  Really, it's a lot easier to live in the city and work south from the south-central neighborhoods (sunnyside, glen park, mission terrace, bernal).<p>Ultimately, I'd say that if you work downtown and only need to go to the valley now and then, the inner richmond is a great pick.  But if you're in a daily commute type situation going south, I'd avoid it.",1279043860

For a prototype, you might just use more expensive components if it's convenient, since the per-unit cost doesn't matter much.<p>When writing software, there's no direct analogy because usually the components we build our programs out of have hardly any per-unit cost. We don't save any money by using a crappy third-party library over a high-quality one. Using a library with lots of unnecessary features may be cheaper both for prototyping and for the final product.",1279041871

Sure that one will be slowed, but the rest of the system still runs at full speed so you're OK.  This can be an invaluable tool.<p>For instance a tool I incorporated into one system would see a parameter to a web request and would issue a command to Oracle telling it to log everything that happened on the database for that connection, and then would turn it off afterwards.  So, for instance, we could take a slow web page, add a parameter, and a minute later be studying a log generated by Oracle telling us exactly what that web request did, and where it spent its time.<p>Having the ability to selectively do this on the live production system against live data with a problematic request while it was being problematic was huge.  We were tracking down problems that only showed up in production, under production load, so no amount of profiling in development would have helped.  Using the same idea, every day we would just take one random database handle, turn logging on for half an hour, and use it as a canary to look for potential problems.  We found a lot of things that way.<p><i>Addendum (added later)</i> It is also worth noting that in many horizontally scaled systems you can trivially have a fair amount of logging, even in production, if you're willing to accept a constant factor overhead in inefficiency.  This can be utterly invaluable in tracking down latency, bottlenecks, and other larger scalability problems.  Every large system that I've seen that was well-run did this to some extent.",1279040610

I think the only real alternatives I would've been happy with would've been either Scala or some flavor of ML or Haskell, all of which definitely satisfy the speed and type-checking factors that were mentioned.<p>Let's put it this way: if any of those languages had half the library support that Python did, then it would've been a decent fight. But as it goes right now it's not even close.<p>EDIT: Sorry, the library support only applies to ML and Haskell, and I forgot about Scala. I'll have to think about this one; I'm not sure the reasoning for that was entirely well fleshed out.",1279040547

4521050,comment,4520858,4520858,3,0,dasil003,,,"The thing that makes Backbone unfriendly to noobs is its lack of prescribed structure.  Personally I love this approach because I know Javascript pretty well, but I haven't written a ton of huge JS apps yet, so I'm still experimenting with ways of architecting them.  Backbone provides a lot of essential functionality in a flexible way that forces me to think critically about how I want to structure the app.  I see that frameworks like Angular and Ember give me more out of the box, but they impose a lot of structure which I am not sure about yet. I'm sure sometimes that structure is ideal and sometimes it may be the wrong tool for the job.  Eventually after I build out more Backbone.js apps in different ways I'll be in a much better position to evaluate the more heavyweight frameworks.<p>It's not unlike how I fell in love with Rails immediately in 2005 having spent the previous 5 years working in PHP, it was obvious why Rails was the way it was.

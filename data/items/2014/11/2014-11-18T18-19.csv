Let&#x27;s run through the standard example from Wikipedia.<p>1) England can produce a unit of cloth for 100 units of labor, and a unit of wine for 120 units of labor. Portugal can produce a unit of cloth for 90 units of labor, and a unit of wine for 80 units of labor. Portugal has absolute advantage in both goods, but England has a comparative advantage in cloth. By the standard Ricardian argument, we get lots of trade and happiness.<p>2) Now let&#x27;s change the situation slightly. Replace all occurrences of &quot;units of labor&quot; with &quot;units of capital&quot;, and assume that capital can move freely between countries. We&#x27;ve lost the key component of comparative advantage, the idea that producing a good forces you to &quot;forgo&quot; producing some other good. Everyone just produces everything in Portugal, and England dies. Whoops!<p>3) Now allow England to set up protectionism, so that all wine consumed in England must be locally produced. This way it can survive. Not very nicely, but between (2) and (3) I&#x27;d choose (3) every time.<p>Am I missing something?",1416337018

The concept of GSM being &quot;just&quot; a modem peripheral is a more recent development, coming more from the laptop arena; pushing that model down into phones (especially <i>cheap</i> phones) will take work.<p>Even on top of that, the concept of not trusting your peripherals is a recent one as well.

Cost is about $1500 for servers and ocassional freelancer work.<p>Here is the issue. The application is not a very simple thing and a lot of potential clients want demo or discuss things over phone. I am getting a lot of interest from potential clients but being solo, I don&#x27;t have much time to entertain all queries. 
So in short, I am growing but very slow and not able to yet quit my fulltime job because I have high family expenses (2 kids,mortgage etc).

That way, I could scale it faster and may be hire an employee or two as well. 
I also have plans to revamp the entire app by getting rid of wordpress and building it properly now that I have validated the idea.<p>Technically, the platform being wordpress is very limiting and I have plans to revamp it but again, need a good team for that.<p>What would you do ?

That means that every classification is a map from a cluster of images to a single label.<p>This cluster of images can be quantified in terms of proportionality, in relation to other objects identified in the scene. We are beginning with the assumption we can compute the identification of individual objects when they are grouped. The next thing to train on is groups of objects as a unit structure, where we infer and learn a proportion relation.<p>Consider a macro shot of an ant with a baseball in the background and perhaps someone&#x27;s finger, and a shot of all three with only one dimension altered to the camera. In the first, all three objects appear to be the same size. In the other, object one and object two express a ratio. Then we can normalize vectors based on the 3 computed ratios (object a : object b). Distance is not solved, but relative distance is.<p>Then, if you can build a catalog of standardized measurements (common objects with a defined distance from a camera, like a face 3 feet away from a camera), then you can start training for actual distances.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about this like how I would reason about the objects in a raycaster: their definition in the machine versus what gets projected onto a 2d plane, and how moving the objects and camera affects the final projected plane. I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m glossing over a lot of details that would actually be difficult in implementation, not to mention computational complexity.<p>> So there is less information in those locations than you might think.<p>I agree, but the only way I understand machine learning at all, as a computer scientist, is &quot;gradual accumulation, definition, and relational organization of humanly defined atomic units&quot;. I don&#x27;t think there are any magic tricks, just a lot of carefully constructed computation, even if it spans over generations of computers, groups, people.",1416336103

There&#x27;s no particular reason to encrypt traffic to most web pages.  Anyone with access to the connection can tell what site you&#x27;re talking to. If it&#x27;s public static content, what is SSL protecting?  Unless there&#x27;s a login mechanism and non-public pages, SSL isn&#x27;t protecting much.<p>The downside of SSL everywhere is <i>weak</i> SSL everywhere.  Cloudflare sells security theater encryption now.  All their offerings involve Cloudflare acting as a man-in-the-middle, with everything decrypted at Cloudflare.  (Cloudflare&#x27;s CEO is fighting interception demands in court and in the press, which indicates they get such requests.  Cloudflare is honest about what they&#x27;re doing; the certificates they use say &quot;Cloudflare, Inc.&quot;, so they identify themselves as a man-in-the-middle.

There are known attacks on CDNs; anybody using multi-domain SSL certs with unrelated domains (36,000 Cloudflare sites alone) is vulnerable if any site on the cert can be broken into.  If the site&#x27;s logins go through the same mechanism, security is weaker than if only the important pages were encrypted.<p>You&#x27;re better off having a small secure site like &quot;secure.example.com&quot; for checkout and payment, preferably with an Extended Validation SSL certificate, a unique IP address, and a dedicated server.

Scott&#x27;s work on Southeast Asia leads me to suspect a highly-organized state that controlled irrigable valley lands would wage war in order not to kill, but rather to enslave/enserf. (The various kingdoms of what would later become Thailand and Burma he writes about were after the Harrapan, but seem to have been similarly situated.) TFA actually mentions &quot;So the Harappans appear to have been a very diverse lot&quot;, which may or may not be credible but is certainly consistent with the regular conscription of agricultural labor from afar. The idea is that in such a situation <i>labor</i> is the limiting resource, not land, water, or military might. The &quot;nobility&quot; always want to have more people at work in the fields than they can really control. Regular promotion of civic-minded peasants to military or bureaucratic service helps to ensure not just that their families will remain peaceable but that more families will be available to work soon.<p>Of course Scott documents this process more comprehensively for the societies he studies than would be possible for this much more ancient society.",1416335226

One of my gripes with Scala is that the type system (as used in the field) isn&#x27;t strong enough. It will implicitly auto-promote types in ways you might not want (i.e. List[Int] :+ String = List[Any]). It <i>can</i> be a strong type system, but the quality of programmers has a huge influence on your experience with Scala. If you have bad programmers who do things the Enterprise Java Way, you can quickly end up with compile-speed issues. But that&#x27;s another rant.

It&#x27;s about selecting the correct server certificate.<p>The handshake goes something like this: the client opens the connection and sends several parameters (in the clear). The server replies with its parameters (in the clear) and its certificate (in the clear, and it includes the domain name). Both sides exchange the key to be used (encrypted), switch to encrypted mode, and verify the handshake.<p>Notice that, even without SNI, the hostname is already sent by the server, in the clear, within the certificate. That poses a chicken-and-egg dilemma: the hostname is sent to the server after the handshake is finished, but the server has to present the correct certificate before the handshake is finished. The solution was to send the hostname (and only the hostname) at the start of the handshake. It&#x27;s no big deal because the certificate hostname is already visible in the next handshake step.<p>For Tor, it&#x27;s no big issue: it just manufactures a random hostname and presents it. Tor would have to do it (in the certificate) even without SNI. When using Tor, this does not compromise the domains requested by the browser, since they are sent directly to the exits within the triple-encrypted tunnel; only the chosen exits can see them.",1416334213

Not because of an altruistic quest to make the web faster.<p>That&#x27;s overly simplistic (even the idea that that&#x27;s the <i>only</i> reason they pay for search placement on Firefox, though that&#x27;s the direct exchange, is overly simplistic.) For funding Firefox and sponsoring Chrome, their goals included:<p>(1) avoiding a desktop browser monopoly by MS that could be leveraged to favor the favor certain online properties or extract rents from them (e.g., to prevent Google&#x27;s core business from being &quot;taxed&quot; by MS), and<p>(2) (for Chrome more than Firefox) Drive the shape of browsers (both directly by implementing these features in a browser that would gain substantial use, and indirectly by creating pressure on other browser vendors to do the same) toward capabilities to more fully replace desktop/native apps, and thereby commoditize native platforms so that Google&#x27;s core competence in the web space would have more reach.

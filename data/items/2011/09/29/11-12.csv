Your mission page is spot on.<p>The amount of time/headache it takes to brand a startup should not be underestimated. I think that the logos are fine to get started quickly but probably would all need to be changed in the long run, but no big deal, you've provided a decent enough starting point where it doesn't look shitty atleast and can allow someone to build their product while still having a decent looking thing on their site.<p>We spent several WEEKS of all hands on deck and lots of $$$ (Well over $10k for the domain name, banners, stationery etc) as a company rebranding from Transparent Financial Services (<a href=""http://transfs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transfs.com</a>) to FeeFighters (<a href=""http://feefighters.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://feefighters.com</a>).  \nHad we started with something better than transfs from the beginning we wouldn't have had the problem (btw, it's still a pain in the ass because google apps doesn't let you change your name, so we still only have a duct tape solution where our google apps are still @transfs and I occasionally still send an email from @transfs - embarassing!). Plus, we lost all the google juice we'd built up over that time (which was considerable - TransFS was a PageRank 5 site and FeeFighters had none).<p>At that point (post-funding), our time and pagerank were a lot more important than the money.<p>More on our rebrand that might be useful to people (you now have to pay to see the video but can download the audio and read transcript for free): \n<a href=""http://mixergy.com/sean-harper-feefighters-intervie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/sean-harper-feefighters-intervie/</a>",1317297438

It feels very much like a scam, or a system were ""success"" can be bought.<p>Second, as one commenter on the article suggests, with a handling fee, the publisher is incentivized to print more. (There's an undercurrent of complain in my field that there isn't enough quality publication space, so this is two-sided, but is the cost of more outlets a lowering in quality?) However, with a subscription model, the quality must remain high to keep subscribers. (One might also argue that ""closed"" publishers want to print as much as possible to give more authors' schools reason to subscribe, but I don't know the level of this effect.)<p>Third, on a more personal level, living as a doctoral studentmore particularly, with the budget of a doctoral studenteven nominal costs can seem overwhelming.

I've been building my computers from scratch since 1998, the last rig I built was just this past December and ingest parts alone a cost approximately $4000. If you were to buy what I built retail you can easily spend $7-$8000. However there are less expensive options out there. I think it's an indisputable fact that PCs outperform their console counterparts in just about every area. One area consoles excel in is the social experience. You do have a lot of options and PCs but the experience is not as streamlined as the Xbox 360.

A brand is a promise to the public which conveys your intent your services and your commitment to your product. Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Disney all do this very well for example.

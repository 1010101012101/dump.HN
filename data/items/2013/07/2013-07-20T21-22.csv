6076676,comment,6076186,6076186,8,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Gladwell notes how military culture differs from civilian culture in Korea.  Surely, differences of similar magnitudes exist in the US.<p>I wonder how the US military has changed culturally over the past few decades.  As an outsider, I have presumed that the purpose of degrading training programs, continual demonstrations of the power of officers (parade reviews, etc.), and required social proof of the officers&#x27; power and authority (stand and salute upon the officer entering a room) all were designed to avoid argument, hesitation, or doubt when an officer tells his soldiers in battle to charge forth toward an enemy firing upon them.  To win an infantry battle, such obedience probably is necessary.  Imagine if only a small fraction of the soldiers were willing to advance -- they would likely be much worse off than if all the soldiers advanced at once.<p>However, this nearly blind obedience surely comes at a price.  Can a junior guy tell an officer that he is unsure of a drone target&#x27;s validity?  It strikes me that a modern military operation is much more like a large scale construction project or perhaps software development than traditional trench warfare.  In these civilian endeavors, the price of hesitation to consider alternative opinions likely is low compared to the cost of being wrong.  Has the military changed?",1374356644

The key point is that when the airline company Korean Air (which had already had to change its name after an earlier pilot error disaster) went into problem-solving mode, the airline itself identified changing cockpit communication culture as a step in solving its pilot error crash problem. Whatever else you can say about an airline company owned and based in Korea, you wouldn&#x27;t expect it to have an inherent prejudice against Korean culture.<p>It was thoughtful of the blog author to quote Gladwell&#x27;s reply in full (as it appears he did). Gladwell is easy enough to misunderstand that I have had occasion to mention this on Hacker News before. Gladwell is a professional writer, and he does quite a lot of research on unfamiliar subjects that promise to include interesting story angles. In the subjects that I research for my own writing, I have more often than not discovered that Gladwell does a better than average job of finding and citing good sources. He originates few new scientific hypotheses himself, but he writes interesting and thought-provoking stories about leading scientists in disciplines facing tough problems. Any reader of a Malcolm Gladwell book (as I know, from being a reader of the book <i>Outliers</i> ) can check the sources, and decide from there what other sources to check and what other ideas to play with. Gladwell doesn&#x27;t purport to write textbooks, but I give him a lot of credit for finding interesting scholarly sources that haven&#x27;t had enough attention in the popular literature. He is equaled by very few authors as a story-teller who can tie ideas together in a thought-provoking assembly.<p>Gladwell has said in an interview by a journalist that he writes to try out ideas:<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122671211614230261.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122671211614230261.html</a><p>&quot;Q: Do you worry that you extrapolate too much from too little?<p>&quot;A: No. It&#x27;s better to err on the side of over-extrapolation. These books are playful in the sense that they regard ideas as things to experiment with. I&#x27;m happy if somebody reads my books and reaches a conclusion that is different from mine, as long as the ideas in the book cause them to think. You have to be willing to put pressure on theories, to push the envelope. That&#x27;s the fun part, the exciting part. If you are writing an intellectual adventure story, why play it safe?

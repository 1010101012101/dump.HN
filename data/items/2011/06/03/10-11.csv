I have worked for smaller companies where this was better but I would still get bored quite quickly, which did not benefit my productivity.<p>I have started doing a bit of Android development in my spare time, this is much more rewarding (not in monetary terms) although it is frustrating at the same time, because I do not have time to really pursue this.<p>I am now considering leaving the job (I am 33, the salary and benefits package is good) to try to start up my own company.

If you believed that by learning .NET you are going to have a unified platform to be able to use it for everything, that's your problem.<p>It's like believing .NET's CLR is a general-purpose VM. Well, it ain't. Yes it provides some flexibility, but you'll never have Haskell on it.

But I realised a while ago that, as Luyt has already touched on, 95% - 99.x% of the CPU time is spent in the Win32 library code, which is written in C, and which you have to call if you want to do anything significant, eg. put up a GUI. That defeats the performance benefit of writing such programs in asm: like Luyt said the slow down from writing the same thing in efficient C or C++ code would be minute. You still get the benefit of tiny executables, though.<p>One might consider the fact that nowadays it's only worth writing ""busy code"" in assembly, and most or all of a GUI app isn't busy code, but that would be being sensible. A web server might have a few pieces of busy code in it IF it's designed to connect to hundreds or thousands of users at once. It would be good to write those in assembly. :)",1307097115

Its not stopped our film industry from producing new and high quality material.<p>Counter anecdote to your anecdote.<p>EDIT: Actually theres a small phenomena going on that I've recently noticed in the Indian cinema/piracy scene which is worth letting other people know.<p>Quick background first: Bhojpuri Cinema - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhojpuri_cinema"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhojpuri_cinema</a><p>Bhojpuri is a dialect of Hindi, spoken mostly in the north easter states of India. Bhojpuri cinema was a relatively dead creature, with a small audience and it paled in financial/audience significance compared to your typical bollywood fare.<p>Now a lot of labor such as security guards, house help, cooks, are immigrants from those states, and of course they speak bhojpuri. They've had to watch hindi cinema when outside of their states though; the opportunity cost of putting up a bhojpuri movie, instead of a bollywood flop, is too high. The choices of bhojpuri speakers were basically Hindi movies or, Hindi movies.<p>Of late though, cheap color mobile phones, about Rs.1,500 to Rs.3,000 ($25 - $50), coupled with rampant piracy, are allowing that gap to be bridged.\nOften when I come in late at night, I can catch security watching a movie on a cheap phone.<p>I wish I had numbers to know how much is being consumed (how much bhojpuri vs regular hindi cinema for example), but I do know that bhojpuri cinema is going to be able to keep and build a stronger network of viewers. The viewers themselves are able to identify and patronize the art form, something which wouldn't have happened otherwise.<p>TLDR: Piracy and cheap mobile phones are letting niche hindi dialect speakers consume and watch movies which would have been drowned out against bollywood. Considering the size of the populations, its interesting to see how this plays out.",1307095840

And the fact that I would work on games wouldn't really compensate for the sacrifices because I'm not a hardcore gamer that went into computer science just to write games.",1200879708

Yet accounting screams over each added penny in recurring costs, while chanting the dual mantras ""software is free,"" and ""hey, it's only a software change.""</i><p>I've worked at a place like that before. They would pay a full team of developers for several months to roll our own custom solution to something we could have bought off the shelf for $1000. People just don't see software as expensive to develop... and unless it's open source, it is.",1200879371

101396,comment,101380,101389,0,0,palish,,,"Ah.. Gears of War is also a single player game.  Steve's game is closer to an MMO.  Once functionality needs to happen across 60 different computers in a synchronized fashion, code can get pretty complicated.  And sometimes a multiplayer setting can actually force you to write functionality that only makes sense in a multiplayer setting.<p>For example, Steve's game levels are tile-based, but I doubt he restarts the server whenever he makes a small change to a level.  That means the level needs to be editable at runtime, which means changes need to be streamed dynamically to all clients that might be watching.  The changes also need to be serialized to the database periodically, so that they aren't lost when the server <i>does</i> reset.. And you need code to make sure two players' views of that level don't get out of sync if they are both editing it at the same time.  That tileset loader code you wrote now needs to be able to support additional tiles at runtime, which means you need a collision tree that can be rebalanced quickly without hogging valuable server resources.  And what happens if a player was standing in a valid tile, but you just removed that tile?  You get the idea.<p>My employment's game is easily over a million lines of code at this point, and the client alone is about 700,000.  Not only that, but the client is completely recompiled for every change - so it takes about 10 minutes from the time you've made a change until you've tested it.  People avoid compiling the engine like a genetically-engineered flesh-eating virus, so you're coding for maybe hours before you test all your changes.  And since debugging requires changing code, each mistake costs you another 10 minutes.  The whole process is like putting together a 10,000-piece puzzle upside-down.<p>Some bits of advice for large C++ projects:<p>* You need to have split your functionality into about 20 different DLLs <i>before</i> you get to the point of being an oh-god-why-is-it-so-massive project.<p>* You must write most of your objects using the interface pattern (a pure virtual interface in the header file, and your implementation exclusively in the source file).  No private function or variable declarations should be written in the header at all.  This facilitates extremely fast compile times.  Here's an example of what I mean:  <a href=""http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/315/example.cpp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/315/example.cpp</a><p>* Sometimes you need to ignore what senior programmers think is best to get your goals accomplished.  Remember, they got you into this situation in the first place.",1200878921

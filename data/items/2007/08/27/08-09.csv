Here's a business idea for how to eliminate junk mail: one mailbox for life. Set up one central mail facility which your customers use as their mailing address. When their mail comes in throw out the obvious junk mail and email scanned copies of the rest. Incinerate every piece of junk mail which comes into your facility.",1188204283
46931,comment,46897,46928,0,0,jey,,,"rms hit on point #2, so I'll respond to point #1:<p>a) Why should an AI be similar architecturally to a human? The size of mind design space is much larger than the space of possible human minds. There's many more ways to build an intelligent system than to copy a human. Humans were incrementally designed by evolution, and are by no means the only possible design. <p>b) What's consciousness? Is it real? It seems likely that consciousness is simply an illusion of sorts; after all, isn't it more useful for you to model yourself as being ""in control"" of your actions? Look up the experiments with split-brain patients; you'll see that one hemisphere will simply dream up explanations for what the other hemisphere is doing! Your brain is a chunk of matter operating according to the rules (physical laws) of our universe. It's a pile of biochemical processes. You understand yourself as ""being in control"" as a model of your behavior, but really, you're a chunk of matter running according to the Universe's physical laws. (I'm not saying we shouldn't act as if we have ""free will""; I'm just saying it may be a meaningless abstraction.)<p>c) Even if we assume consciousness is some property needed for an intelligent system, why couldn't we implement consciousness in something other than a human? Isn't a human an existence proof that it's possible to implement an intelligent system using just matter?",1188204172
46929,comment,46897,46928,0,0,rms,,,"Regarding point 2:  why can't you replicate consciousness? Of course we can't today, but I don't understand why it is inherently impossible. <p>Just because my consciousness is different from everyone else on the earth doesn't mean future technology couldn't copy my mind to a computer fifty times over. It will be very controversial when technology progresses far enough to allow consciousness copies.",1188203367
46928,comment,46897,46909,0,0,yters,,,"I know I'm probably just bringing up an issue that has been beaten to death somewhere in a hideously long thread, but consciousness makes me think strong AI is impossible.  This is my line of thought:<p>1.  Consciousness is essential to human intelligence, because our great mental advances come from our awareness, and objective description, of our own mind and thought processes.<p>2.  A consciousness is by definition irreplicable, since two different consciousnesses are essentially different.  <p>3,  If strong AI is possible (and computational), and there is no essential difference between copies of the same code, then multiple identical copies of the same IA mind can be made.  <p>4.  If 1 and 2 hold, then 3 is false.  Therefore, strong AI is impossible.<p>If any of these assumption need elaboration, let me know.  And please, by all means, direct me to that hideously long thread instead of answering my argument in detail.  I don't like to waste people's time.  Much obliged.",1188202994

46925,comment,46007,46693,0,0,altay,,,"Here's mine.  You ever play Erotic Photo Hunt?  It's a game on those touchscreen video kiosks in bars.  Each round, you're shown two almost-identical pictures of a scantily-clad girl.  You've got a minute to find the 5 subtle differences in the two photos.  (It's embarrassingly addictive -- for both men and women alike.)  <p>Build a web-based version of that.  After every round, the player is given two options... ""play the next round"" or ""see more pictures of this girl.""  The latter is a paid link.  Weekend hack => goldmine.  ",1188201648

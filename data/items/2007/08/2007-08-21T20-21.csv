44958,comment,44876,44876,0,0,geebee,,,"I don't think that a K-12 school for hackers would work especially well.  That said, it would be nice if schools stopped practices that almost seem to deliberately extinguish hacking and startups.  Schools teach you that you need to ask permission to do things.  It isn't until you get to college that you don't have to ask permission anymore.  <p>Hackers and entrepreneurs become who they are by realizing that they don't have to ask anyone's permission.  <p>I remember learning violin when I was a kid.  If I played something that wasn't on my ""to-do"" list, my parents would call upstairs ""are you practicing, or just messing around?""  <p>I read that Andre 3000 used the three chords in ""Hey Ya"" because, well, he'd just recently picked up the guitar and those were the three chords he knew.  Didn't ask any permission, just started composing.  <p>Recently, I saw a dude in a coffee shop with a guitar, and he was technically awesome.  It was fun to stop and listen for a few minutes, but I wouldn't have been able to tell you what he was playing five minutes later.  <p>Schools don't really teach creativity, and I don't think they can.  But they might do a better job getting out of the way.  <p><p><p>

44942,comment,44580,44787,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""There is a well-worn path for beginners in PHP, with baby steps and encouragement all along the way.""<p>Down that path lies madness.  I've seen the newbie-focused tutorials for PHP, and it explains a lot of the garbage that passes for software in the PHP world.  It is entirely possible to write good software in PHP (I'm reasonably impressed by the Dokuwiki and Flyspray code, for example), but you have to learn the language at least twice to get to that point.  You learn it as a newbie, and learn horrible practices from the vast collection of misguided ""help"" in the Internet.  You produce lots of code with those horrible practices...like no DB abstraction, inappropriate or no use of objects and encapsulation, and ""gradually mix PHP into your HTML"" design.  And then you realize you've built an unmaintainable mess and start rewriting it with all of the better practices that have since been bolted on to PHP.<p>Of course, despite all of that I still recommend PHP for a large classes of application because it is pervasive, hard to make pathologically slow (whereas Ruby and Python can be made pathologically slow even by really good developers--see Plone for an example), and has a pretty large selection of libraries (some are so bad as to be counter-productive, but many are good).  But as a newbie language it's rather toxic.",1187726861

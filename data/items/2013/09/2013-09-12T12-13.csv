6373697,comment,6371932,6372441,4,0,super_mario,,,"I would say your experience is typical for 99% of the people. High school is ridiculously easy even in Europe let alone in North America. High school can be aced with common sense, some intelligence and minimal learning. And if you happen to go to school in a small local community you are doubly unlucky, because it&#x27;s much easier to be a local star student there and build unrealistic perception of yourself and pick up a lot of horrible habits that will almost grantee you don&#x27;t make it later in life. You should not ever gauge anything by high school success (high school failure is on the other hand a good predictor of university success).<p>Then you move to a hard science university and slowly start realizing that you must actually work and study 8 hours a day or more just to keep up and the subject is basically a bottomless pit, there is no end of it and you could spend thousands of lifetimes studying a single subject and still feel like you are only scratching the surface. This is also where intelligence has lesser and lesser significance (almost none). You may notice that good work habits, good organization habits (anything from note taking, listening, attention to detail, to times you study, to light in your study room), and social skills (who you associate with in school is more important then intelligence) and the ability to stay motivated and inspired by your subject etc. matter way more and are a better predictor of academic success.<p>I had similar feeling as you (I did pure math undergrad and pure math grad school). You are not slowing down mentally, you are just getting fatigued and saturated and getting into more and more esoteric and fringe areas of your subject study. You have to know that most of those visiting professors are lone experts in esoteric razor edge thin subject and they get incredibly excited when they hear there might be another person somewhere across the globe who might have remote interest in roughly the same thing as them. That&#x27;s just to give you some perspective. I&#x27;m sure when you look back at those courses you took years ago and that you thought were incredibly difficult and challenging, you find them trivially easy and boring. That means you have grown by order of magnitude.",1378990755

Huge inboxes (10,000+ emails) - I do keep most/all emails archived, but that won&#x27;t help with a mail client since even the Archive is part of the index. (My workflow is to deal with an email conversation and hit archive on the gmail web interface, this way I keep my inbox clean)<p>2. Need to use features like search, labels, etc.<p>3. Multiple gmail accounts (4 at the moment..)<p>I tried keeping 4 tabs open in Firefox with tab grouping but over a period of time the browser would really really slow down.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Mailplane but it is very buggy (keep getting errors of being logged out - especially when composing new emails). It&#x27;s also very slow in terms of marking things as read (I open an email and my notifications will still say that I have the same number of emails read)<p>With Mail I had the issue of the system really slowing down due to the huge number of emails.<p>The last version of Sparrow also has the same issue but not as bad as the mac Mail.<p>So how does everyone on HN manage their multiple gmail accounts ?

6373684,comment,6372510,6373044,2,0,jamesmcbennett,,,"Interesting case study of a company that was a leading trophy company in the US in the 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s that had a model that worked. They had a single production location that shipped nationally across the United States.<p>They thought they could do the same in Europe, immediately running into problems as they quickly found they would need a distributor in each country which would take a rather large chunk out of their margin. They still proceeded and found that everyone had different tastes, the Italian&#x27;s liked something flamboyant, the French preferred something classy, the English wanted something Iconic and the German&#x27;s wanted something Minimalist. In the US, everyone wanted the same thing. In short, the company went bankrupt in both regions due to the errors made in Europe.<p>There are language differences, cultural differences, tax and regulation differences, additional costs of multiple companies to be setup during expansion and the list keeps going on. Startups stuggle to scale in Europe for very clear reasons, it&#x27;s much harder to do so. With a small team and little resources, a company can address the entire United States, in Europe they simply can&#x27;t (of course there are a few lucky exceptions).<p>So as a European, what has Europe needed for the last two decades to be competitive? Quite obviously, it is to level the playing field and remove those barriers to zero. Until that happens, European Startups will never be able to scale to the size or with the speed of their US competitors. While I think European founders are as smart as American founders, by the points above, does that even matter?<p>Easier translation such as <a href=""http://www.reverbeo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reverbeo.com</a> (Friends of mine) will take care of the language barriers on web businesses.

While I agree that the incantations required are relatively complex, they do become second nature (e.g. I&#x27;m an on-and-off user of perhaps 2 years, and I&#x27;m comfortable with the basics).

Shortly after opteron was released and ibm came out with a 64bit jvm I moved the whole thing except for the esri portion over to a simple load balancer running apache and two mirrored dual opterons running fedora 64bit (2002).  A total half rack which handled about a million image reqs a day or so.  Each req involved decomposing, reading and stitching image mosaics together and sending out in under 10s.  Unfortunately we were back ending more than just terraserver so I don&#x27;t remember who had what specs.  With all the memory alloc/dealloc going on inside the java process we were fortunate if it didn&#x27;t require a full restart every 12 hours.<p>The funniest part of the whole thing was that I rewrote the engine from java over to a c++ stitcher and got request times under 1s on a dual p3 600.  That was bypassing the esri server, oracle database and java stuff.  At that time the umn mapserver started getting interesting as well although their image processing was glacial at the beginning.

6373578,comment,6373073,6373499,1,0,Cthulhu_,,,"> Nonetheless, I think it&#x27;s worth entertaining the hypothesis that in many ways the internet is like candy for your brain, and constant exposure might have subtle -- perhaps not yet fully recognized or appreciated -- effects on our cognition.<p>It does, actually. Read Nicholas Carr&#x27;s &#x27;The Shallows&#x27; [0], it&#x27;s a pretty decent book about the subject. It also starts off with comparing our usage of the internet with the rise of reading - you know, books and the like. History lesson; humans needed to adapt their brains to be able to read attentively for longer periods of time. The book contrasts that with the ADD nature of the internet, and yet, indicates how it&#x27;s actually going back to where we were before. Or just a change similar to when books became publicly accessible.<p>tl;dr, yes there is a change, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily good or bad; just different. And shocking / to be resisted by the older generation, just as how their parents were shocked and resisting the Beatles and similar long-haired freaks. :p<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393339750"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/...</a>",1378989061

It might even be that the back door is only exploitable for some part of the output, maybe the part where you are most likely to find a suitable prime number during some key generation process.  Intel periodically releases new products, so the NSA would have plenty of chances to update the backdoor as software changes.",1378988205

I posted about iOS7s battery life in the BETA and you started getting agitated about an iPhone 3gs upgrade (not iOS7...)<p>The phone is 4 years old. That&#x27;s quite a long lifespan for a phone and if you&#x27;re angry because the battery life has depleted, you obviously don&#x27;t have an idea about how batteries work. Of course a new update is going to have an impact on the battery. Since it requires more CPU/Memory (which the iPhone 3gs is severely lacking in) the battery takes a hit.<p>>Why do you keep talking about &quot;beta&quot;. As I&#x27;ve said in the downvoted posts already (twice): It was a NORMAL UPGRADE downloaded because iTunes kept bugging me with it. NO BETA HERE.<p>Then why are you talking about it? We are talking about the iOS7 BETA. Not iOS3.<p>>Of course it is useless as a mobile phone. It&#x27;s supposed to be a mobile phone (for travel etc.). So, if I have to keep it plugged in just to do calls, WiFi and bluetooth, then it&#x27;s called a landline phone and I have to buy a new mobile phone.<p>You said <i>my</i> phone. Not <i>yours</i>. <i>My</i> phone acts perfectly as a mobile device :)<p>>The contribution here is: DO NOT &quot;UPGRADE&quot;, UNLESS you are ok with being forced to buy a new phone BEFORE your &quot;old&quot; phone ceases to fulfill your actual/real needs! I hope this is now clear enough.<p>Don&#x27;t upgrade if you don&#x27;t want to. Nobody is forcing you to buddy. I wouldn&#x27;t expect an old computer to handle all the new games perfectly at full resolution<p>>It has to do with Apple&#x27;s apparent general battery strategy. The devaluing of devices sold as &quot;upgrade&quot; was done a few years back, and as I&#x27;ve mentioned above, it&#x27;s still done today.<p>Which is nothing to do with iOS7",1378988188

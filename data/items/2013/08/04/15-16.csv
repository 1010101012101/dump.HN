Post-quantum cryptography has to avoid ECC since the elliptic curve discrete log problem is easily solved by  quantum computers.<p>Regarding the possible solutions other than ECC: There are no hash-based encryption schemes, only hash based signatures. I believe there is little faith in any multivariate scheme to remain secure under serious scrutiny. Many such schemes have been broken. The outlook on lattice cryptography, and some coding theory based schemes is slightly more positive. Apparently ECC has received much more attention and study than either of these.",1375630807

But I also think that an informed and learned individual in this day and age will recognize that dragnet surveillance encroaches on fundamental rights of human privacy. If I were an employee at NSA and had been asked to implement some part of PRISM I would protest within the proper confines of law, and ask to be given other work which I would be ethically okay with.<p>> <i>Refusing to take part doesn&#x27;t absolve you of anything, according to your philosophy</i><p>I think in this context it&#x27;s fair to interpret a refusal to work on something you deem evil not as inaction but as an act that makes it difficult for evil to prevail. If most good men did this they either would not find persons to complete the work or only be able to find persons who cannot do it well or do it completely.<p>To further clarify, what I am really saying is one&#x27;s decisions at work which are detached from any ethical considerations is a problem, they&#x27;re <i>not</i> just engineering problems -- they affect people, in good ways or bad.

And, as it happens, the chances are that since a lot of this stuff work requires high competency, whenever you find yourself in a situation where determining the morality of your work is exceedingly difficult, there is good chance you can easily find good work elsewhere that will give you the right engineering challenges without the difficult ethical questions.",1375629246

I'd like to get your feedback on how to make it better.<p>Address is http://miraclefruitstand.net/<p>Let me make this clear: I'll be grateful if you just throw some advice my way on how to take this to the next level. Don't feel obliged to purchase anything; my desire is not to spam (but I will say I enjoy the products myself).<p>For the curious lurker, here's what I did:<p>>Contacted the warehouse rep.<p>>Arranged to be a distributor for the product (which isn't hard - basically just reviewing their policies and getting familiar with how they operate).<p>>Found out their dropshipping rates; calculated the margins for myself.<p>>Registered the domain with NearlyFreeSpeech.net - saved a bunch -  11 or 12 bucks.<p>>Built the site with wordpress and customized it in a day. Theme, plugins, etc...<p>>Plugged it in to paypal.<p>>Tested out the payment system.<p>>Set up an Adwords campaign which began this morning, using a 100 dollar promo coupon from Google + 10 dollar activation fee. Spending 3.33 a day on advertising, testing the system out using google's cash instead of my own. From that I garnered 3 clicks, 1985 impressions, for a %.15 Click through rate. (Here's a question: is that good or bad? The campaign literally started at midnight.)<p>Basically if the site fails, I'll have lost around 20 bucks. I also have the option of repping wholesale to retailers in the area, so I'm not entirely dependent on the site, thought I would like for it to be an automated source of income.<p>Haven't had any ""real"" sales yet. Processed two orders, one from family, one from a friend, and the company later informed me they'd just send it to my family for free - essentially I've earned back my 20-something dollar investment back already.<p>So - What do you think HN? How can I make this better and improve sales quickly? Anything I should be aware of from your own muse-creation experiences?<p>Thanks much!",1268444759

1188272,comment,1188012,1188175,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> set a separate password for over-the-phone stuff<p>Sorry, but I think this is the phone equivalent of insisting that you set a password using uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols, at least 20 characters long and changing every 3 days. People are just going to start using obvious things or writing them down.<p>True story: A few months ago, I took out a new credit card. During the application process, including activating phone and Internet access, I was asked for something like sixteen different pieces of personal/security information. The first time I wanted to call them a few days later to check something was now ready, I was asked for my ""pass code"". I had no idea which of those pieces of information that was, so Call Centre Guy says not to worry, he can verify me via other details. He runs through a series of questions, at least one of which makes no sense in the circumstances (in fact, that was the reason I was calling). At the end, he says he's sorry but I've failed security and he has to hang up now. All he can say is that I haven't provided the required answer to all of the questions. I tried to go on-line, and was asked to enter some memorable information. Apparently, I gave them three different things during sign-up and any one of them would do. No doubt I chose someone's birthday, etc., but of course I had no idea who and there was no kind of prompt. So I couldn't get in over the Internet either. Finally, I gave up and went back into the branch, where the staff had been helpful and efficient while I was setting things up to start with. They called through to a special number... which transferred to the same call centre and resulted in the same series of security questions, even though I was sitting in a secure area of one of their branches, with an employee who had already authenticated themselves, and who had seen my passport and driving licence two minutes earlier (which means they had access to two photos, two signatures, and my current address as a minimum). I gave exactly the same answers I had given to the previous guy, explained in exactly the same way why one question didn't make sense, and was told that was fine and how could he help?<p>When I call my other credit card company, they ask for my six-digit DoB and typically my current credit limit to verify before doing anything significant.<p>My business account needs a single password for everything, and for extra security provides a device where you push a button to generate a six-digit code that changes every few seconds.<p>Two of these have the right approach. The one that uses separate security information for everything and all kinds of different types of validation is not one of them.",1268444083

The obvious reason why Courier won't be doomed by this is ... you need an iPad, most people in this world aren't going to buy one.<p>Most won't buy a Courier either but there's plenty of room for both to be independently successful regardless of the other.",1268442085

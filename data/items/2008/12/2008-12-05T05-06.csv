It's in doing the side projects on company time <i>and then trying to unambiguously own them</i>.  Didn't you sign something to the effect of saying you wouldn't do this?<p>Back when Diffle was a part-time project for me, I did bugfixes and stuff while I was at work.  After all, I was often blocked waiting for another team member, and coding on some other project is a better way to keep skills sharp than surfing Reddit.  But I <i>threw away the code</i> and started fresh when I left my day job and turned it into a full-time startup.  Granted, part of this was for technical reasons (I found the code I'd done on nights & weekends basically sucked), but part was because the best way to unambiguously own the software was to not have written it on somebody else's dime.<p>#13: For me, the appeal of programming is in having my code get used.  Making it incomprehensible seems a good way of ensuring it won't be used in the future.  In both of my last two employers, I put a premium on readability and documentation, even staying about a month longer than I'd hoped to at my last employer so that everything was documented, all known bugs were worked out, and all unit tests passed.",1228456455

I do <i>not</i> agree that raising IQ rather than reducing pain is ""logical and sensible"" at all - and just because you think it is does not make it universally so.<p>Taking someone else's words and then telling them what they really meant can never be a valid form of discourse.

They use credit/debit cards more than cash.<p>On the other hand, I think it's important to support local businesses (when they deserve it) and the idea of a co-op of local businesses sounds like a good idea. In fact, I think there could be a startup idea in there. Something like:<p>1. A business creates a co-op group online and other local businesses can join.<p>2. Consumers can go to the group's page online and purchase a gift certificate/voucher that gives them $1.10 credit on the dollar.<p>3. Consumer prints it out (has a unique code on it) and can use it at any of the member stores<p>4. Member store would just need internet access to enter the code and debit the voucher and could transfer their money out later<p>Thoughts?",1228453370

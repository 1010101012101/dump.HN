Is it possible that the impression of deep wisdom, maturity and superior vantage point in these cases is an artifact of perceived social status?  The article is pointing out situations where effects of social status interfere with the potential responsibilities of providing arbitration.<p>As humans most of us rely on judgment of social status as one of the most fundamental ways to allocate resources and interact with one another.  It creates an inherent bias when we grant the right of arbitration to a fellow human, because the privilege alone can elevate perceived social status, and possibly interfere with the granted responsibility.<p>The independence of social status from the right to arbitrate may be a measure of justness and liberty in a social group.",1235235342

What you don't know you can't analyze and what you can't analyze might very well be the cause of your problem.<p>Good programmer (tm) can write excellent code in Java, because like any other tool it will respond to its handler. If you are just using classes to pile layer upon layer of unwanted abstractions on top of each other because you fail to grasp your problem properly then you have nobody to blame but yourself.<p>Again, in some languages this kind of behaviour is actively encouraged and in some it is discouraged, I suspect that java is one of the former.",1235234980

I'd like the chance to run these larger tests, but I could never justify that kind of money (> a server) on load testing. It's a pretty big jump.<p>If the higher-end plan ends up being popular with a certain type of business (?), perhaps you could include a few ""mega-tests"" per month for the low plan. I would mind fewer 250 tests if it meant I could perform a couple of 500 or 1000 tests.<p>Who <i>is</i> your target customer anyway?",1235233883

Gold is expensive to produce.<p>If by ""shore up devaluation"" you think that governments will destroy fiat currency, I think that is unlikely to happen. Do you have examples of that ever happening? Usually more is printed and sometimes so much that you end up with hyperinflation.<p>With the current cost of gold productions, which are unlikely to change dramatically, hyperinflation of gold is not possible. Gold provides security and the market appreciates that. Yesterday it did top $1000 (again) by the way.",1235233412

489890,comment,489827,489827,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm no expert on enterprise software, but this tallies with my casual observations.<p>Note that Java didn't <i>make</i> enterprise software into a bloated, confusing architectural spaghetti. It just found its niche there. Remember that Java was originally intended for writing embedded software for set-top boxes; then it got repurposed for writing ""write once, run anywhere"" desktop applets. It is only because the language was a nigh-complete failure in those niches that it became primarily known as a language for server-side enterprise software, which has influenced its development ever since.<p>So it might be that the enterprise development ""pattern"", memorably characterized by PG as ""maintainable spaghetti"", did this to (Java's) OOP, not the other way around. But I would suggest that it's a little of both: Java and the ""enterprise pattern"" are <i>coevolved</i>, like the chicken and its egg. At this point it's hard to sort out which came first.<p>UPDATE: I should point out that the author says more or less the same thing:<p><i>OOP didn't do this to us; we did it to ourselves. OOP just held our hats.</i><p>His title is a rhetorical question, so the fact that I think it's subtly misleading is actually a sign that it's doing its job. ;)",1235232702

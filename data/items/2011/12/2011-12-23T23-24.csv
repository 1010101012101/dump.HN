First in the economics of Supply and Demand, there's a shortage of good developers programmers, generally in the marketplace. The CIO doesn't sound like he's aware of this, obviously in such a climate, there's money to be had, if you're good? Second, Being ""older"" and ""looking in"" from the outside, there's an increasing ""penchant"" amongst the rising up generation, and I'm going mildly stereotypical here, ""I want to create, design and make"", which doesn't really gel with older traditional businesses that want to maintain codebases, that, that are key to their enterprise. Yes, they could shift with the times, and kill off decades of codebase and start again in Ruby on Rails, or similar, but at what cost? The whole iT industry goes through cycles like this every 10-20 years. Ironically, you either lose people to more innovative technology OR, later, you end paying more because it's gone to legacy and no-one around ""does that anymore"". Look at COBOL (before most of you were born). I love the IT industry, it's constantly changing which always creates opportunity, some struggle with this concept. Last, I think the CIO needs to recognize these and changes and adjust his approach, if you were him, with financial constraints, what would you suggest he do in recruiting?",1324683963

3387615,story,,,7,18,steventruong,"Tell HN: Some of you are straight up bullies",,"I might get flagged or down-voted in this thread to kingdom come but I don't care. This needs to be said.<p>Like many here, I strongly oppose SOPA and believe in freedom of choice, or rather, a free Internet. And I understand that there are many reasons why people would want to move off a service like GoDaddy for their support of SOPA that has come out in recent days. Of course there are a lot of other reasons people have for not wanting to stay with GoDaddy such as poor service, the elephant killing, etc... and this simply became the last straw for a lot of people. Whatever the reason, I get it. You want to take a stance and not do business with them, partly due to a difference in beliefs, and that's okay. For what its worth, I'm moving my business off GoDaddy as well.<p>Having said that, what I am NOT okay with is how many people have become bullies as a result of this. You may not like the fact that they are supporting SOPA (or were) but that doesn't mean you have to be an ass about it. In my personal opinion, the real objective was always to help educate others on the potential harm SOPA represents, and help spread the word about it so that others can understand and make a choice, and hopefully do the right thing in opposing it. It was never about personal attacks against GoDaddy. Maybe I'm alone in this thinking but not doing business with them was more due to mal-alignment in personal beliefs than it was to screw them over.<p>However, that's exactly seems to be the case with some people here. I am reading about how people want to get other companies to drop GoDaddy to prove a point. And what point is that? That if other people/companies have a different opinion than yours, that they're automatically the bad guy and you need to do everything you can to beat them to a pulp? I may not like SOPA and I may disagree with GoDaddy, but I can at the very least respect other people's opinion (including companies). I'm glad that a lot of people are standing up for their beliefs and moving their business away from GoDaddy, which is a perfectly fine <i>personal</i> choice. But when it all of a sudden sounds like that became the objective, to simply pile on and get everyone to drop them, and then try to recruit other large companies to do the same or risk your wrath, you lose sight of the real goal. Now you're just attacking everyone who doesn't share your belief. I like to believe we're all adults here and we can act with class rather than like playground kids about it.<p>Maybe you don't like their service. Maybe you hate them for various reasons outside of just SOPA. Maybe there are a bunch of other reasons I can't think of. Regardless, GoDaddy is entitled to their opinions even if that opinion differs from your own and being a BULLY is never acceptable behavior in my opinion to get what you want no matter how strongly you feel.<p>For the record, I'm glad they reversed their opposition (and hopefully not doing some under handed stuff privately). I'm still going to move my business away simply because I don't believe its truly what they want and they're only doing it because its hitting their business. I'm glad that the word about SOPA is getting out. In no way am I defending GoDaddy in any way, shape, or form. All I'm trying to say is, remember what you're fighting for. Don't act out a mob mentality on the wrong things so much that you lose sight of what is important.",1324683236

There, he pointed out that these apparently divergent forms of corruption are entirely compatible, and that they actually share the same root, which is the obscene reliance of elected officials on a vanishingly small number of campaign donors.<p>Depending on the day of the week, these donors can find themselves initiating bribes, or being shaken down for bribes by officials wanting to increase their takes. The stink flows both ways. And it ensnares people who, left to their own devices, would have nothing to do with 'the trade' whatsoever.<p>Accordingly, Lessig is illuminating the entire economy of corruption, correctly observing that you cannot choose to attack one branch instead of another. Instead, you have to ignore all the branches, and go straight for the root. If any good comes from SOPA, it will be in generating a backlash strong enough to go after the root directly. The nerds, for what it's worth, are the people to lead this. Why? Because we are, by nature, systems thinkers. And this is a systemic problem of the very severest degree.",1324682658

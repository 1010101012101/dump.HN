Especially when the flash properties change between generations and even in the lifetime of the flash itself. Flash generations also come by very quickly as it is already.",1419415165
8792309,comment,8791274,8792190,0,0,pedrocr,,,"The same argument is used for TCP offload to NICs and from what I&#x27;ve seen it ends up being a bad idea because host CPUs advance much faster than the ones you put in your SSD/NIC/etc. Add to that the fact that you are almost surely leaving optimizations on the table from separating the two layers and I&#x27;d very much doubt there would be much performance loss.<p>And I&#x27;d gladly take a performance hit if it meant SSDs become a safe commodity product like hard drives mostly are vs the current situation where a crappy product may very well erase all its data on an unclean shutdown. Manufacturers don&#x27;t want this of course because there&#x27;s more margin to be had with the current stuff. Maybe some low end manufacturers could start to implement low-level flash access and Linux using it for the situation to change.",1419415159

Again, this is a well reported bug that many people have noticed 6 months ago and it would take an Apple intern 20 minutes (maybe an hour if they were very inapt) to locate and fix the issue. It&#x27;s just not a priority to them. I really wish that they would switch to a 2 year OS release cycle, and work harder on stability of the core OS. They can pull Messenger, Mail, Facetime, and all the other apps out of the OS package, and add features to those all they want, but I want the core OS to be stable.",1419415133

The problem is then that some of the flash trickery is for very specific flash and requires careful calibration, things like programming time which is per-flash chip and sometimes also changes across time.<p>The ONFI standard only specifies the protocol and the wiring but not the soft parameters, these may be added in there if people wanted but the flash companies are evidently only trying to grow up into the market rather than just provide building blocks as that allows them to squeeze out more profits so I can&#x27;t see any incentive by them to expose such an interface and support the ecosystem that will spring up and take all of their extra profits and leave them to build massive foundries for peanuts per unit.",1419415036

>Your experience for example seems more like some rogue app with extensive CPU/memory usage driving the battery down. Have you checked Activity Monitor to try to spot if that was the case?<p>Yes, I did perform basic investigation. I switched from Chrome to Safari, because Chrome was eating battery like crazy. I shut down anything that I wasn&#x27;t using. Browsing the internet on Safari I was getting 3.5 hours on a charge. I even timed it! And I am not the only one, read the Apple forums complaining about this. I even reset the PRAM, as Apple recommends. It didn&#x27;t help. Now I am running a lot more apps, using Chrome, compiling stuff in the background, and still getting my usual 5.5-6.5 hours of battery life (depending on the load). So, yes, I did spent over 20 hours of my life trying to make Yosemite work, and then gave up and switched back to Mavericks. I had a CC backup, so it only took 20 minutes.<p>>Actually your memory usage should go down with Yosemite -- they have new technologies just for that. Same for battery file, it should go up.<p>Also, I didn&#x27;t not mention anything about memory usage, but you are right, the memory footprint was lower. About 1.6gb on average, vs 2.6gb with Mavericks. But I don&#x27;t care about that, I have 16gb, so I have RAM to spare. On the other hand, I can use all the battery life I can get.<p>Apple does some amazing things, and some really bad things. It&#x27;s important to give them due credit for the mazing things, and call them out on the crap that they put out as well. Yosemite is very slick looking and a very pretty operating system. But it is very buggy, and what Apple put out as a GM release is beta quality at best.",1419414760

Look for `if ((count < max) && !option_bool(OPT_NO_PING) && icmp_ping(addr))` in `src/dhcp.c`. Most of your lease acquire time is spent in `icmp_ping()` which actually just sends ARP requests for 3+ seconds then gives up. It&#x27;s actually not even very reliable when someone is using the IP already, because many devices won&#x27;t respond to ICMP.<p>There&#x27;s an option to disable it (OPT_NO_PING) which does improve lease performance with pretty much no downside (as ICMP is a flawed way to check if an address is in use anyway).<p><pre><code>  -5, --no-ping (IPv4 only)
  By default, the DHCP server will attempt to ensure
  that an address in not in use before allocating it
  to a host. It does this by sending an ICMP
  echo request (aka &quot;ping&quot;) to the address in question.
  If it gets a reply, then the address must already be
  in use, and another is tried. This flag disables
  this check. Use with caution.

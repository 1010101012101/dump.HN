True, costs may be becoming more managable, and resources becoming more abundant, but as that happens you start to run into issues with market saturation causing not just problems with supply but with demand.<p>Economists and sociologists alike have long preached to the choir that too much of one thing in a society can be bad for the big picture.  Take for example the problem with American Obeisity.  The more buffet items a restaurant displays, the more a person is likely to eat while negatively effecting their health overall.<p>Make the parallel to these startups, social content sites are now a dime a dozen, feed aggregators are everywhere (so much so that there are even aggregators that aggregate other aggregators) and consumers find themselves overwhelmed with the choices they have to make when selecting the simplest problem they need to address.  When this happens, people often opt not to do anything and would prefer a direct fix through another means than to go and experiment with what's new on the market.  This is essentially why you see very few startups aimed to address corporate interests where obviously the potential to make money lies, but instead targets a much smaller sector of the market (37Signals for example).<p>All of that said, prices and income potential for the startup in my opinion is coming very close to reaching a stalemate, while supplies continue to grow, demand is going to drop.",1205452669

Both my co-founder and I are exclusively vim users, and at a previous software dev shop I spent a few years doing contract work for there were several emacs (which I don't consider in the same vein as Eclipse and VS or whatever--though it depends on how you use it) users, a nedit user, and a couple of other users of plain old text editors.  And all of them used the same set of custom build scripts and development tools, which were all command line with matched sets for Linux and Windows.<p>Only about 40% or so used a big IDE (Eclipse or Microsoft's stuff, plus a few IntelliJ) full time.  A few more used Microsoft's stuff for the debugger when they needed it.",1205452536

I got a job that paid a miserly $30,000 / yr at first, but it was a small company and I got tons of experience. I was in way over my head at first as you can probably guess from reading everybody else's posts. But I worked and learned hard, and after that it was a piece of cake.<p>If you are like me, I only wrote a couple of thousand of lines of code in college. I'm up to somewhere around 150,000 now, and I feel proportionally more confident and capable. I just scored an internship at Google actually.<p>Then my only problem was that I got bored, so I'm spending all that money on a masters degree, which I am thoroughly enjoying.",1205452315

136380,comment,136098,136098,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've always had problems doing business internationally from US banks.  EFT is ridiculously expensive in the states...and no one even knows what a SWIFT code is at every bank I've ever used (I don't know what they are either, but I know they're supposed to make funds transfers easier and faster...but they just mean the local banker spends a half hour on the phone talking to someone in NY trying to figure out how to deal with the SWIFT code).  This is an area (banking in general, not just EFT) that I think subtly raises the friction on US companies doing business internationally that I suspect European companies don't have to deal with.  One of many straws that eventually leads to Europe being a better place for business than the US.<p>I've yet to find a bank that I really like for business, and I've been through several.

There isn't much they will teach you in school that will really make you that much ""better"".<p>The biggest difference between school and work for me was the process and the environment. Some of the big things I saw:\n* version control and development process\n* rapid bug fixes and changes\n* managing your own ego\n* testing your own code\n* working in teams, dealing with other people's code<p>These things are almost impossible to learn on your own. They are all things that can inherently only be learned in teams. Which I think is the big difference between school and your career...school is about you, your career will be about what you can produce with others. You need to find a project, anything, and get some experience working with a team (even a two person team). That's my two cents",1205451019

But then I realized that I hadn't really defined myself, my views on software and development, business, etc.  I was like someone who could run, jump, do jumping jacks, etc, who went around saying ""I want to do sports for a living"".  I had basic tools and skills, but no direction.  It sounds a little embarrassing to say, but how else was I supposed to gain direction without going through different experiences?<p>If you're not sure what you want to do or what really drives you, don't be afraid to take a decent looking (but not necessarily dream-) job offer, stay a year or so, then go to another <i>different</i> type of company. Think of it as a slow, well compensated data collection process that will lead you to a better understanding.  Sure it sounds lame when put next to the laser-focused entrepreneurial stories on HN, but so what?  Do what's best for you (and your family - important consideration).<p>PS If you do that, don't forget to code and learn something <i>completely</i> different in your spare time.  That push/pull helps you grow a lot faster and benefit both parts of your life.  Right now I'm .Net by day, Lisp by night.  How much more different can you get?",1205449874

Of course, if he were really motivated by money before anything else, he's probably smart enough, by merit of getting a BA, to figure out where to board the gravy train.<p>2. If you're doing development work, you've probably been doing testing for years anyway. Saying that you've never tested anything extends to your own code, meaning you expect someone else to clean up your mistakes. Who has time for that sort of attitude?<p>3. If you let it. If you're a tester and want to be a developer, you'll get a lot farther toward that goal by not developing a false consciousness about your path limitations. A claim I would have no problem believing is that your past experience as a tester will make you a better developer. I was a tester at a small company for a little while before getting back into development. It taught me a lot.<p>4. Go to grad school because you love the topic, want to understand it deeper. If it's really just about the money, there are quicker, cheaper ways to get it.<p>5. Agree with this, except it's more about what you did than where you were.<p>7. What the hell is this about Al-Qaeda membership? Are you for real?<p>8. Yeah, knowing/learning the business is a good call. Knowing/learning the needs of the company is a good call, too. But really, assuming an pre-established pecking order for employees based on the ""type"" of company, in a very general sense, seems a bit premature. Also, just because your at the top of the totem pole doesn't absolve you of learning about the business or their needs, because being a ""software person"" doesn't mean you know their software.<p>8.

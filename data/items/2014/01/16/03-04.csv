If I want to scale and get beyond a handful of beta-customers, I need to automate those processes.  I&#x27;ve analyzed what it would take, and it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s out of my range to boot-strap.  If I don&#x27;t automate, or even partially automate, I&#x27;m going to be stuck with a handful of customers.  With automation, I can add dozens, if not hundreds of customers.<p>Secondly, not only are some of my customers asking for a whole new incremental feature set, but I see the market ripe for the picking.  In order to develop these new features, it&#x27;ll require a new wave of development (for mobile) that I also can&#x27;t self-fund.<p>Outside money would help in both of these, allowing me to move beyond perpetually having a few customers to growing this venture into a growing business.",1389844314

Here are some of my thoughts.<p>> I said this law is right.<p>Here are your words: &quot;Collusion is [...] not bad unless it&#x27;s illegal, and what we&#x27;ve decided in the US is [...]&quot;.  Looking at this, and the rest of the comment, I can see that:<p>1. You can imagine US collusion law being in a state other than what it is (&quot;what we&#x27;ve decided in the US is [...]&quot;).<p>2. The only argument you present is that the conduct described is illegal.<p>3. You specifically acknowledge that in some sense, the fact that the conduct described is illegal <i>is a coincidence</i> (in modal logic, it is not a necessary truth); it&#x27;s how the US decided to handle the law.<p>As the existence of the law is the only argument you presented for the badness of the conduct, I conclude that you are arguing that the conduct is bad <i>because</i> the law prohibits it.<p>The alternative, that you are asserting with no justification that the conduct is bad, and also remarking, apropos of nothing, that the law prohibits it, violates Grice&#x27;s maxim of relevance.  It also violates the structure of what you said, which was a quite clear statement that if the law does not prohibit collusion, that collusion cannot be bad.<p>I will happily license you to restrict my comment to the domain of collusion; I&#x27;m willing to believe that you did not intend your audience to infer &quot;assassination is not bad unless it&#x27;s illegal&quot; from &quot;collusion is not bad unless it&#x27;s illegal&quot;.  But we are discussing collusion, and everything I said applies there.  The example I picked, antitrust law, is specifically related to it, and is even specifically the main topic of the post. So: if the US repealed all its antitrust laws, can I assume you would agree that any collusion formerly prohibited by them was now unobjectionable?  If not, would you like to revise your comment?<p>Finally:<p>> Your disagreement on semantics is just plain wrong.<p>Compare to my comment, &quot;I have to agree with the bare semantics here&quot;.<p>> If the law they broke is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; law, then the fundamental difference between what these companies did and what a union does is the &quot;secret&quot; part of a conspiracy.<p>There is no blanket &quot;conspiracy&quot; law in the US; it would violate the freedom of assembly.  For conspiracy to be criminal conduct, the object of the conspiracy needs to be illegal.  Therefore, the fundamental difference, as I pointed out before, is not that the companies acted secretly and unions act in the open.  If the companies acted in the open, that would still be illegal.  The question you&#x27;re dismissing is, why?",1389843896
7067952,comment,7064470,7067885,1,0,ilaksh,,,"OK I think I sort of understand what you are saying.<p>Such as, for example, why don&#x27;t we have an easy to use program like Dropbox that is just built in to every operating system, or freely available and in common use?  Rather than having a bunch of people rely on this commercial system just to transfer files or make them available on the internet.<p>I agree that we are reinventing things an amazing number of times.  I think we have at least 5 times as many crappy ways to accomplish basic things as we need.  And certainly more cohesion is called for.<p>On the other hand I think that people often don&#x27;t appreciate how changes to fundamental approaches are the best way to solve problems because problems are often structural or caused by the way the issues are framed.<p>I agree that there is too much reinventing the wheel and fragmentation of effort.  I don&#x27;t believe that Node.js is a good example of that.  Although 54000 modules is too many and there is quite a lot of redundancy and crap in there.

Plus building costs for new stuff is financed in unamortized $RECENT_YEAR dollars rather than amortized $DECADES_PAST dollars.<p>For land-constrained places like San Francisco, where the only way to increase supply is up, this dynamic is probably more true, since however old the tech is, it&#x27;s a lot more capital intensive than stick framing.<p>Where I <i>have</i> observed a decrease in price, it&#x27;s never been because of supply increase.

7067896,comment,7067402,7067737,10,0,bane,,,"> This makes me wonder how our own media is manipulated to influence political movements?<p>Something I&#x27;ve found very interesting is watching foreign news media and what they report on and some of the externals that surround that reporting...then reversing those observations to my own country&#x27;s media. It&#x27;s remarkable how taking that outsider&#x27;s viewpoint and turning it towards your own native media can help you to understand where they&#x27;re manipulative or not quite truthful with things.<p>In my case, my wife is from South Korea and I get constant exposure to the news (important and trivial) about her native country. There&#x27;s lots of, to me, obvious political influence in South Korean news. It took a few years, but eventually I was able to convince my wife that this was happening. Of course she had some inkling that it was happening, but the various phenomenon I was pointing out to here had completely escaped her notice.<p>One of the most common in her country is to hide embarrassing political issues with wall to wall coverage of a recent scandal that was just &quot;discovered&quot; about some top-tier entertainer: it&#x27;s usually a sex scandal, but it could be tax evasion or gambling issues. Those entertainers then &quot;retire&quot; or disappear for a couple years and inevitably stage a come back. The public&#x27;s attention span is so short that the political issue is quickly forgotten while the poor singer or actor or whatever is drug through the press for a few weeks. It&#x27;s <i>very</i> rare that a political issue will stay front and center over an inconsequential starlet&#x27;s sex video.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the very deep relationship the government there has with the major production companies and broadcast networks. It&#x27;s changing slowly, independent media is starting to spring up on cable networks and podcasts and such, but the overall homogeneity of South Korean pop culture means that most people will still just go to their favorite old media sources for most things anyways. The good news is that they aren&#x27;t really spreading lies, just choosing to suddenly report <i>at this very moment</i> about something that doesn&#x27;t matter at all when something that does matter is being ignored -- so they can still say they have a free press and all that.<p>Recent protests and firings at some of the major broadcasting companies have shown that this isn&#x27;t nearly as true though.<p>Turning back on my country&#x27;s media and I see similar tactics used. I think we&#x27;re a bit more subtle about it, it&#x27;s not quite the clockwork mechanism that I see in South Korea, but I think there&#x27;s always some agenda to what gets covered and when. I think the government influence on major media producers here is just as deep, think about the flood of pure propaganda action movies that came out during Reagan. They&#x27;re hopelessly obvious these days, but I don&#x27;t remember them being such obvious propaganda back then.<p>These days, my wife and I play this game now when some outrageous, but largely inconsequential, news start getting played up endlessly in our respective countries. The game is called &quot;what&#x27;s <i>really</i> going on?&quot; And we remind each other with this question that the game has started and we&#x27;ll spend the next hour or so digging into the internet to try and figure out what embarrassing political situation is being glossed over so we can see an actress trip on stage for the 800th time, or some singer spectacularly flame out in public.<p>I can think of no better example of this in action then this<p><a href""http://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/19insert-word-here-differences-between-time-magazine-us-an"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/19insert-word-here-differ...</a>",1389842822

I want to see that abolished. Because I&#x27;ve seen a lot of negative feedback of the argument, I want to offer an addition to it.<p>As an example, I had my eye on Kentucky Route Zero since I saw it in IGF and I fit the example user &quot;It&#x27;ll go on sale. I&#x27;ll wait&quot; But after a year it only went on sale for 50% (crazy, I know) and that happened a couple times. At that point, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to go to 66% or 75% any time soon so I picked it up. I can see a happy medium with sales where you make it clear that you won&#x27;t go on sale for a certain period of time and/or for a specific discount. You don&#x27;t necessarily have to verbalize that either. I don&#x27;t follow any KRZ news but it was clear that that price point was not going to change quickly. This way you still get the press about sales (I saw a lot of KRZ at 33% and 50%) without having to screw fans over.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a few ways of strategizing it that would require some experimentation (e.g. a bit before a steam sale, have another 10% type discount like might be seen on launch week but make it clear that it&#x27;s not going to go below that). There are also more mediums for sales with the Humble Store now you see a lot of games with shallower discounts.<p>I will say I don&#x27;t think this model works as a long term plan however. I like the idea of starting low for pre-orders and then increasing the price over time, but I don&#x27;t think it would work as expected over a two week period. With Minecraft there was the expectation of more content over a period of a year or so between increases. It may still be viable but that may be a case for early access. Make it clear there that the price will increase when it&#x27;s finished.<p>I hate seeing what appears like developers feel like they have to sell out on their baby, and I hope something like this can work.",1389841971

Many people still run very old computers because they do not have the disposable income to buy new ones.<p>My computer can run the newest version of Windows but I have a Windows XP/Win 7 dual boot setup. I keep Windows XP around because of old games from the Win9x/WinXP era which do not work (correctly) on newer Windows versions. Unfortunately, there is no WindowsBox (i.e. a DOSBox equivalent) yet. I have tried virtual machines but the experience was not positive. They are for running old office apps, and tend to fail miserably at running DirectX games.",1389841392

A clean install of XP, with nothing else included, occupies about 3GB of disk space. You&#x27;d still have 4GB of RAM free to run the system.<p>But as of Vista, the mandatory minimum RAM was escalated (from 64MB) to 1GB, and all to support a hideous UI, and not much else. The operating system sprawls across 64GB of disk space.<p>With every new version, it feels just as shitty as before. Despite umpteen quadruplings of hardware resources, shit still feels like it&#x27;s Windows 95, fucking again. Nothing gets faster. Drop $3,000 a year, just to swim against the tide, with incremental changes in the appearance of progress bars, so that ugly animations can actually flash periodically as they steal your youth from you, rather than inflicting anxiety whilst freezing intermittently.<p>Every subsequent version of Windows fails to improve, continues to suck, and in some areas it actually gets worse than it already is. But christ almighty. After 20 god damned years. Why?",1389841367

You build up a static, symbolic computation graph representing a mathematical function, and then you can call theano.tensor.grad(...) on that graph to get <i>another computation graph</i>, a symbolic representation of the gradient.  Everything is completely symbolic at this point -- you could prettyprint the  computation graph output by Theano&#x27;s `grad` function and get exactly what symbolic differentiation seems to give you.  You can then call theano.function(...) on either of those graphs to get an actual (Python) function which you can substitute concrete values into.<p>edit: in fact, Theano&#x27;s own docs on its gradient-related functions [1] call it &quot;symbolic differentiation&quot; right at the top.<p>edit2: I decided to try this on the author&#x27;s sin(x+...) example he uses as a pathological case for symbolic differentiation.

In this analogy, in a procedural language f, g, and h would be lines in your source code, which modify the overall program state to produce some final value. There are a few different ways to actually do it (including the rather tricky concept of &quot;dual numbers&quot;), but ultimately it amounts to differentiating the overall program f(g(h(x)) recursively using the chain rule. It&#x27;s [often] more efficient than direct symbolic differentiation because of this recursive evaluation - think of it as something like tail-call optimization.<p>It&#x27;s not an approximate method, nor does it care [directly] about floating point.

10825237,comment,10824382,10824382,0,0,Animats,,,"Good IPC requires tight coupling between the IPC mechanism and the scheduling mechanism.  In QNX, you call MsgSend, which sends a message and blocks.  On the receive side, a process waiting in a MsgReceive gets the message and unblocks.  The fast path for this, when there&#x27;s a thread waiting for a message, does not go through CPU dispatching or CPU switching on a multiprocessor. This is crucial to performance.<p>You do pay a penalty for copying. For short messages, it&#x27;s low. For anything that fits in cache, that you just created and will use immediately on the receive side, it&#x27;s very low.  Really big messages may add 10%-20% overhead.  This is the main problem with drivers in user space, because they don&#x27;t do anything with the data, they just move it around.<p>Incidentally, copying under QNX is preemptable by high-priority tasks. There&#x27;s a hard upper bound on the longest uninterpretable kernel operation, and it&#x27;s measured in microseconds.  That&#x27;s why you can use QNX for hard real time.<p>Contrast what happens on Linux. You have a few choices (System V IPC, pipes, sockets), but they all work like I/O operations. You send something, and you don&#x27;t block when you do.  If there&#x27;s someone waiting on the queue or pipe, their thread becomes active, which means a trip through the scheduler to get them going.\nSince the sending thread isn&#x27;t blocked, if there&#x27;s a free CPU, the receiving thread starts up on a different CPU, which means lots of cache misses.  The sending thread probably blocks shortly after the send by reading something or waiting for a message, but the OS doesn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s going to happen.  So when it does, there&#x27;s another trip through the dispatcher for work to do.<p>In a compute-bound environment, this may mean that each IPC operation sends you to the end of the line for CPU time.  Trying to use IPC operations like subroutine calls is painfully slow in such systems.<p>Write something that does short IPCs and waits for replies, and benchmark it. Then add some compute-bound tasks, enough to keep all the CPUs busy.  If the IPC task performance drops by orders of magnitude, the IPC mechanism is badly designed.<p>L4 is very impressive, but I think they went a little too far by using shared memory as the main interprocess communication mechanism. This gets copying out of the kernel, but means that one process can screw up the format of the memory region it shares with another process. The OS may be robust and secure, but attacks on the process you&#x27;re talking to by messing with pointers in the shared area may be possible.<p>The big problem with QNX is that it costs money. Linux is free, and Windows is basically given away with hardware and trialware.<p>I hope that someone writes a QNX-like microkernel in Rust. We need that.",1451713372

The `grad` function in Theano (and the equivalent in TF, not sure what it&#x27;s called) takes a computation graph (a symbolic expression of a mathematical function) as input and produces a computational graph expressing the gradient (which as you said, can then optionally be evaluated at specified points).  So maybe the author wasn&#x27;t referring to these types of frameworks when he said there have recently been an explosion of these autodiff tools?

The real discussion involving microkernels is about the future of OS development. Should it just be the same as Linux, forever, with no architectural changes? Have we literally written the last OS?<p>As a layperson, I can be persuaded microkernels are a good idea that could yield some reliability and security improvement. I can be persuaded that the performance issues are avoidable. But I&#x27;m also pretty sure that most of the problems we have with current systems are in code that would now be outside the microkernel anyway. We are going to end up with, optimistically, about the same number of lines of code. So to me it seems much more important what the development process looks like.

I love the conceptual simplicity of micro kernels, they are easy to abstract and they are easier to show they have predictable response in a wide variety of situations. I have also met some really strong advocates for them, and listened as the QNX folks went on and on about how much they were investing in making these things better than any alternative, and yet here we are. I haven&#x27;t attended a SOSP[1] symposium in a while but I do still look through their proceedings when I get a chance at the Stanford Library.

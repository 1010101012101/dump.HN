For example, we have Mac and Linux users, but could also easily accommodate Windows users as well. Other benefits include the fact that you can really lock down the VMs to be exactly as production, whereas it's unlikely that a local dev machine would be the same (Does your production machine have Firefox installed?)<p>Another benefit is that when we change the configuration of production (which is all managed with Puppet) we can just update the dev machines because they were built with Puppet as well, without worrying about screwing up someone's desktop machine.<p>Plus, you can take snapshots...\nYou can rebuild them easily...\netc<p>Lots of benefits.",1285156592

I recently went through a few rounds of interviews with several people at a large software company and i did not send thank you emails.

It is so obvious that people know it's something they have to do and just kicked out these canned scripted thank you messages. Most people's inboxes are already full and they are busy why would they want this?<p>And my personal opinion is that, honestly they should be thanking you. I mean, they need help. They put out a ""Help Wanted"". You have skills that can help them. They asked if you wouldn't mind taking 3 hours out of your work day so you could go down to meet several of their team members so they could evaluate you and help them make certain they are hiring the right person.

Then again, you're not as flexible, since your desktop gets messed up once you disconnect from 2 screens.<p>I'm pretty sure that a sensible developer's desktop + sensible developer's laptop cost about the same as one beefy dockable laptop which can handle 2 screens. Seriously beefy laptops tend to be not very portable unfortunately because of the size + weight. (I do not consider laptops above 17'' portable anymore - if it doesn't fit in a backpack, it's too large) Also working on the laptop all the time will kill your battery (or you might risk leaving it out for a long time and discharging it completely) - which breaks the flexibility idea again.<p>Plus, If I had a desktop and a laptop, I'd just use synergy to have 3 screens available ;) Laptop screens are perfect for having terminals with `tail -F some logs` quickly available ;)",1285155804

1715760,comment,1715597,1715597,0,0,rakkhi,,,"I must say I am impressed with the RIM potentially abandoning the Blackberry OS for something different, although why not just Android or WP7 is another question. I do not think anyone is under an illusion that attempting to simply copy the iOs with BBOS6 was not really an overwheliming sucess (<a href=""http://lat.ms/9TQwrZ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lat.ms/9TQwrZ</a>), as an OS it is actually probably not that bad but sticking it on an underpowered device, maybe to save battery and production costs was far from an insipired decision.<p>I was worried about this though: ""device will only be able to connect to mobile networks through a Blackberry"". If that means it just works like a Blackberry currently and connects via the organizations BES then that would be fine. If it is somehow needs to pair with a BB to connect to the internet and other networks then that will be very disappointing and contribute to the failure of the device.<p>I have actually been very bearish on RIM recently with its loss of mindshare and a lack of a really competitive product against the iOS and Android devices (smartphone and tablet). But combined with the sharp increase in revenue (<a href=""http://yhoo.it/9Od7im"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yhoo.it/9Od7im</a>) as well as Apple and Google not really addressing the enterprise challenges (in security, deployment, centralised management: <a href=""http://bit.ly/amZzud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/amZzud</a> )\nThis gives me renewed hope for RIM, I am actually going to reverse my stock holding and go long.",1285153840

Both Lucent and Nortel was showing gigantic growth with huge sales and profits figures but it was all a ponzi scheme.<p>They were selling to all these CLECs and vendor financing the CLECs. That means while Nortel is selling a lot of stuff, no money is coming in because Nortel is financing all the sales itself.When the dotcom boom crashed, the CLECs run out ot capital and couldn't pay back Nortel and Lucent. Both companies have to take huge write-offs and face huge cash crunches.<p>Compare that to Nokia. Nokia's in its last quarter generated EUR 1 billion of free cashflow. Just for comparison, Google generated $2.35 billion in free cashflow.",1285153838

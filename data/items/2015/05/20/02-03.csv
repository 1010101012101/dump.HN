It&#x27;s not the it&#x27;s a specialized language for the military, but a language created to cleanup the DoD&#x27;s software nightmare of the 70s, which is not unlike the software nightmares of today. It just happens that they had a pretty good grasp, even at that time, of what helps make good software easier to write, large software projects easier to manage and maintain, and strong ideas about how much a language should intervene if the programmer is doing things that look pretty dumb.<p>Ada has a neat OO system (not like the Javas or C++s), built-in state-of-the-art tasking (since 1983!), ranged types (one of the things I can hardly bare to live without), but also simple things like switches that aren&#x27;t useless and just a general appreciation for what a discrete type can allow you to do. It has generics, too, though I know they&#x27;ve been proven irrelevant by newer languages. Have you seen that new Java 8 date time stuff? It&#x27;s playing catch up to Ada. Ada&#x27;s numerics are, hands down, the best facilities of any mainstream language.<p>Most importantly, it&#x27;s probably already available for your Linux distribution because it&#x27;s a part of the GNU Compiler Collection, which means that it&#x27;s on the commercial OS you&#x27;ve settled for, as well.<p>An out of print book that I always recommend to those who are interested in playing with Ada is John English&#x27;s &quot;The Craft of Object-Oriented Programming&quot;.

Plus the error messaging is awesome and the isometric approach is just a huge win, the previous version of the product was in angular + rails, industry standard but slow as hell, absolutely did not perform like a native mobile app, but Meteor is just fantastic in my experience for extreme starup scenarios where we are going with Mongo anyways. Certainly if I needed to tie into legacy sql based systems I would be looking at loopback, but with lookback you are still stuck with the weight of the other available front end frameworks and the back end is easier, but you still have to do tons of boiler plate, except perhaps with react + loopback in the case of place a really modern front end on a legacy system while still having ok performance.

A second sort pass over the next most significant digits would take another 7 hours, and then the bills would be sorted into groups of about 10.  At that point you&#x27;d want to put the money into, say, a thousand or ten thousand envelopes, organized into drawers or folders or something, so that when the DJ calls the number, you open the right drawer, pick out the right envelope, and scan through the five, ten, or twenty bills in there to find the right one, if you have it.<p>You could do the passes lazily, too.  Spend the 7 (or 28) hours to do the first sorting pass into piles of 1000.  Then, when the DJ reads out the number, pick out the right pile of 1000 and spend 4 minutes sorting it into 100 piles of 10 or so, which you then stuff into 100 envelopes, possibly calling the DJ at the time.  If the DJ calls another number with the same leading two digits, you&#x27;re prepared; if not, hey, it&#x27;s 4 minutes.<p>So you&#x27;re right.<p>Sad.  He legit hacked the Press Your Luck show by figuring out hidden patterns that he could use to do the apparently impossible.

Seeing two is cloying. Seeing three makes you aware of how intolerably formulaic they are. In fairness I&#x27;ve only seen half of a few, because they bored me stupid by the time they were half way through and it had become apparent that the whole schtick was to make the audience feel special and insightful. So I may be missing something wonderful.<p>TED suffers from the same malaise as all &quot;cutting edge&quot; forums: it has no apparent effect on the world, other than transfering money from attendees to speakers and organizers. Which is great: taking money from willing dupes is as old a humanity, but as the years role by it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain that anything more interesting than the release of the latest forumlaic blockbuster is going on.<p>Refuting this claim is easy: all you have to do is show a dozen or two cases of people who came away from TED changed in a some permenant and actionable way. People who didn&#x27;t just go back to the same jobs doing the same thing in pretty much the same way. Does anyone have any data rather than anecdotes on this?

The impact on real estate costs, and how people spend their time, will be huge. 2017 is just around the corner; I doubt that we will see a significant metropolitan area adopt self-driving cars as Ray suggests. Perhaps 2018 or 2019?<p>2) Personal assistant search engines by 2018: I think there will be the rise of a personal AI that will help us do many things and act as the main interface to the connected world; ONE thing this AI will do is help us perform search engines. Ray implies that this will happen in 2018. I have no idea. It seems extremely hard. I would guess 2020 or 2021?<p>3) Switch off our fat cells by 2020: I am scared by this. The reason is simple: there are huge economic interests around health and nutrition, and any medicine that can seamlessly help people reduce their fat and become lean is so dangerous. What will the implications be for our health?<p>4) Click and print designer clothes at home by 2020: I think Ray is wrong here. The ability to print clothes that have the same quality/design/motives of normal clothes is quite hard. Perhaps it will work for simple ones.<p>5) Full-immersion virtual realities by 2023: Wow. VR seems to be exploding these days. Just today FOVE launched their Kickstarter campaign (<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fove/fove-the-worlds-first-eye-tracking-virtual-reality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fove/fove-the-worlds-fi...</a>), and it&#x27;s an example of a real innovation in the field (eye tracking). However, full immersion would essentially require the ability to connect directly with the brain. Hmm... 2023? Don&#x27;t know. Maybe not.<p>6) Vertical agriculture: why? Why should vertical agriculture take off and represent a substantial % of food produced?<p>7) 100% of our energy from solar by 2033: impossible. First, nuclear plants and hydroelectric plants serve some purposes in addition to simply generating electricity (military, energy storage, hydro management). Second, producing enough solar panels to meet demand WILL SIMPLY NOT BE POSSIBLE by 2033. I would more reasonably say 2045.<p>8) Stay young forever by 2040: well, if this is true, and if I&#x27;m still alive by 2040, I will be 63 years old, and I will never die. What a fascinating, intriguing, and scary thought.\nFor some reason, I have big doubts on the feasibility of making this happen by 2040. I do believe though that rich people will have access to some form of DNA alteration tools that will help them achieve something very remarkable - perhaps close to the &quot;staying young forever&quot; promise.<p>I wish that, by 20XX, the world would be a better, fairer place. Inequality is becoming a huge concern for me, and the power of megacorporations and the control that they have over us is also a concern.\nI really wish we would measure our progress mostly by this, and not simply by looking at technological advancements.",1432087604

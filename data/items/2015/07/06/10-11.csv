Defaulting on the debts will have consequences, of course, some good, some bad. Difficult to say if, in balance, this will be good or bad for Greece.<p>> Democracy is responsibility of the successive government for the deeds of the previous one. May that be debt or a warcrime<p>OK, bring the accused to the courtroom. And, now that you are at it, bring the rest of the players. The banks, the Troika, and all the rest that have profited from this whole saga.<p>The blame does not lie <i>solely</i> on the Greek.<p>The outcome of the judgement can very well be positive for Greece: maybe some banks have to repay some interest, maybe the IMF has to restructure some of the debt because they badly advised past Greek governments, maybe Germany has to repay that old loan they took from Greece and never repaid, maybe the Euro-area has to compensate some members for the prejudice of helping Germany become the world export leader at their expense by using a weak currency, maybe the UK has to pay some fines for allowing the financial markets (by opposing regulation) to bet against economies bringing them to the brink of bankruptcy ...<p>We can factor all those things and see who owes what to whom (impossible), or we can recognize that everybody shares a part of the blame and help one member of the European Union - which probably made huge mistakes, but can&#x27;t now stand on its own.",1436180333

9838143,comment,9836651,9837887,0,0,morganvachon,,,"> I&#x27;ve never really understood the idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day...<p>I&#x27;ve always heard that you should have the most calories and greatest diversity of food at the first meal of the day, slightly less so at the midday meal, and a very light/low calorie dinner. This is supposedly because you need that huge energy and mental boost to get your day started, and as the day goes on your caloric intake should taper off as you won&#x27;t need it as much by the time you get home from work, and a light dinner because within a few hours you&#x27;ll be sleeping and won&#x27;t need it either.<p>Now that being said, it wouldn&#x27;t work for me. I am up around 6-6:30am, I have breakfast (when I do eat it) at 7:15-7:30am, and my morning at work is decidedly not busy nor does it require critical thinking (I&#x27;m basically stuck answering the sales lines in the morning as the rest of the team doesn&#x27;t roll into work until nearly lunchtime). This is off-season, so I might get ten calls before lunch, and about half of those are non-productive. I take an early lunch, around 11:30am, so I&#x27;m available for the larger part of the afternoon. So, the time between breakfast and lunch is usually four hours. That&#x27;s not enough time to fully digest a large breakfast and be hungry again, so I usually either eat a light breakfast or none at all.<p>What I&#x27;ve found is that if I eat small meals for breakfast and lunch, with a snack available should I need it in the mid afternoon, I tend to focus better and get more done. The only downside is that by the time I get home and finish cooking dinner, I&#x27;m ravenous and I end up eating way too much for that meal. That&#x27;s the part I&#x27;m trying to focus on now and cut down to about half. This will put my overall caloric intake at less than the &quot;maintain&quot; level for my build and age, which will hopefully help me to slowly lose weight.",1436180227

The gun control issues really shouldn&#x27;t revolve around mass shootings any more than the issue around national nutrition should revolve around nut allergies. It&#x27;d be insane if the country was arguing banning peanuts after someone dies from a nut allergy. But we do the same with guns now.<p>The real discussion is the everyday issue regarding guns. And you&#x27;re probably correct with your assumptions. Here in the US, we have 4x the homicide rate as, say, the UK, where gun ownership is very low.<p>And our violent crimes is probably only about 60-70% of their rate.<p>BUT, if we look at per capita rates for that, it means here we have about 3 more people killed out of 100,000 each year, but they have about 200-300 people beaten, raped, etc each year out of 100,000.<p>Again, crime rate comparisons are a very inexact and difficult thing to do well, but my numbers for this come from a rebuttal of a pro-gun sound-byte, so I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;re a bit on the conservative side: <a href=""http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/01/12/fact-checking-ben-swann-is-the-uk-really-5-times-more-violent-than-the-us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/01/12/fact-checkin...</a><p>Personally, I&#x27;m lucky to not know anyone who has been shot dead by a criminal. (I do know someone who was shot dead by police while drunk though - but police gun ownership is not at all on the discussion table in the US). I do know two people who were beaten and left brain damaged, and one that was raped in front of her kids during a home invasion with a knife-welding assailant. Now, I&#x27;ve mostly lived in areas in the US that were the least gun friendly (NYC and CA), so maybe people in other areas would have different stats. But certainly even here in the US, violent crimes are around 100x more common than homicides, and a reduction of 30-40% there would improve a greater quantity of lives than a 4-fold reduction in homicides. (The net quality of a trade-off is extremely debatable. And a debate we should be having.)<p>Still, I&#x27;d love to see better and more trustworthy data at a greater scale than what&#x27;s currently available before I throw my weight behind one side or another. I can argue either side because both have valid points. But I find myself at a loss for which I ultimately agree with, as I simply don&#x27;t have enough information to make an educated decision. And as someone that actually actively looks for the data, if I can&#x27;t figure it out, I have a hard time listening to self-assured opinions on the matter (of which there are plenty on both sides).<p>This is a complex issue that needs sophisticated analysis, but that&#x27;s not at all the attention it gets as long as the only time it&#x27;s discussed is in the context of a knee jerk reaction to a 1 out of 7,000,000 occurrence.<p>P.S. I bring up the ways violent crime has reached the people around me not to try and sway with an appeal to anecdotes, but simply to add the human element to the generic &quot;violent crime&quot; term. We have the human element of gun violence constantly put before us in the media, but the crimes people survive (though often scarred and broken) simply don&#x27;t get the same attention. These are often serious matters and at 100x an already 4x inflated homicide rate, they are the issues I find myself more worried about than guns.",1436178158

Even London, which is by any reasonable measure the largest hub of start-up activity in Europe and has seen the most significant exits, comes nowhere close to Silicon Valley in terms of deal volume, capital availability, density of senior talent, etc. Sure, tech start-ups exist in Amsterdam and in Berlin, and in Stockholm, and in Barcelona, but these cities aren&#x27;t technology hubs, creating self-sustaining economies driven by meaningful exits and the development of world-leading domain expertise: many of the start-ups in these cities are only sustainable because VCs in Europe are primarily funded by European governments.

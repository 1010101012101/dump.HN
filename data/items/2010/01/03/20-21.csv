1029125,comment,1028328,1028350,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"Your final comments touch upon a couple of peeves of mine.  I would insist:<p>1) That hosts and presenters supply relevant materials enough in advance to allow review, when said are not already available.  Over 75% of internal meetings I've attended in the past some years have the agenda delivered via email less than 5 minutes before the meeting start.  It may serve the CYA documentation requirement, but little else.<p>2)  That attendees actually prep for the meeting.  Sometimes, with a small and/or tight team, people already know the situation and are ready to put their heads together.  Much more often, though, many enter the meeting with little or no knowledge of what it's about.  (These are the same people who spent e.g. the previous hour schmoozing at each other's cubes.)  75% of the meeting time is spent rehashing what is already known, in an inefficient verbal format.  Is it any wonder that those who are actually on top of things hate meetings?<p>Working on a good and conscientious team, I've been able to hold meetings that sometimes require only a few minutes and that break up as soon as the questions and information at hand are addressed.  (Perhaps with a few minutes extra for a bit of humor and socialization, depending on schedules.)  Outside of that context, I just stopped going to some meetings, when I could afford to.<p>Restated briefly, if you can't be bothered to document the topic, why should I go to your meeting and do it myself with a bunch of idle time and intermittent note-taking?  And/or sit quietly while others catch up.  (Or worse, I find myself repeatedly having to correct and clarify the host.)  If/when you need my help badly enough, you'll start being more efficient (and respectful).<p>Of course, this attitude does not go over so well, politically.  Which is probably a good sign to start looking for the next gig.",1262552310

1029121,comment,1028713,1029008,0,0,catfish,,,"What you make of twitter depends upon how you seek value in its application. I run over 50 accounts for businesses and the key opportunity for customers isn't in tweeting endless streams of news links, or building huge follower list, or adding a 100 friends a day.<p>The key value can be found in the @mention box on the right hand side of the interface. If people are making mentions with your name, that appears in your @mention box. Every time that happens that is an invitation for you to ""ask a question"".<p>Ask enough questions and in short order you will establish a relationship with a prospect. Ask the right questions and you will convert that prospect to customer status.<p>If you do this right, and your honest with the account, i.e. your profile, your twit background, and your tweets openly publicize your business status, you will be rewarded with 5-10 new leads a day who are actively interested in what you offer.<p>That begins by carefully selecting who you follow. Don't follow more people in a day than you can actively interact with in a single day.<p>Don't ask questions that are leading. Always ask questions that require a reply.<p>Don't press anyone who isn't engaged in the answers.<p>Always acknowledge the answers.<p>Take your time. Be patient. Offer value when asked.<p>I tell clients to imagine you have entered a coffee shop and every table is taken. Find an empty seat near someone who has a profile you think would make for an interesting conversation.<p>Be polite. Ask for permission to sit down. Do not talk about yourself. Ask questions. Learn what you can about your table mate. At some point that person is going to become actively interested in who you are. They will visit your profile, look at your tweets, click through to your site. And if you are providing value at any of the touch points they see, your going to convert many to follower status, and some to customer status.<p>And the best thing about this approach is that you never spammed anyone. The entire cycle began with them talking to you.<p>The only part of this method i left out is the step where you get them to mention back to you. I will leave that to your imagination. And if your a bright cookie, you will find a quick answer to that.<p>For those of you who find this methodology tedious, and too hard to sustain, GOOD. That's better for me. The barrier to entry is hard work. Every day.<p>And a bit of imagination.",1262552041

Right now you have to sign a contract with iTunes and your content has to cross a quality barrier to get entrance, but Apple could easily remove that.<p>But I also believe that Apple and Netflix aren't in the business of selling a service to indie filmmakers. They are more in selling a service to the end consumer. And because of this it's in there interest to not have their libraries polluted with 90 minute long low quality videos.<p>My focus is on providing a service to filmmakers first, and to simply provide a usable platform for the end users who purchase it (hence the DRM-free videos).",1262551578

This topic gets under my skin.<p>Beyond that, I would say that many of the things prescriptivists discuss are <i>not</i> grammatical mistakes. They are often disagreements about usage where reasonable people can disagree, but more importantly many of them are literally myths. That is, many of these so-called rules have never had good support in English usage or etymology or linguistics. In many cases, they are just usages that bothered someone in the 19th or 20th century who made a lot of noise.

My point wasn't that we should celebrate it, but that cranky rants aren't good ways to deal with bad writing or speech. It helps to write well. It helps to recommend good writing.

1029097,comment,1028968,1028968,0,0,albertsun,,,"The problem might just be that the market isn't properly pricing intent generation right now, and because of that companies can exploit that price gap and purchase a lot of intent generation advertising relatively cheaply.<p>Apple is a good example of this. They seem to spend a lot on intent generation advertising: TV ads, major branding campaigns on nytimes.com, prominent billboards, etc. All this works to make people want to buy Apple products.<p>However, this can only work for products where the advertiser monopolizes a product that is differentiated enough. For example, no company has an incentive to pay for intent generation for travel to Hawaii, because no company can capture all the profits from more people going to Hawaii. Someone after getting the idea to go to Hawaii will be just as likely to purchase from a competitor.<p>I think over time, as we get better at measuring the impact of intent generation, we will see more and more spend on that kind of advertising and rates will rise as companies that decide to spend on intent generating advertising do better.",1262551394

1029067,comment,1028968,1028968,0,0,swombat,,,"Very good point, but I'm not sure there is a valid solution for this, in part because intent generating sites are often only good at generating intent if they're seen as being impartial. If the blog post you're reading exposes that they'll make a profit if you buy the widget they're talking about, you're much less likely to trust that blog post.<p>So the intent generation and intent harvesting may need to remain separate. This does raise the question - how can intent generation be rewarded? Well, there are several answers to that. Intent generation is a side-effect of being someone whose opinion is paid attention to (whether for the span of a single blog post, or as a regular source of information and insight). There are many ways to derive profit from being someone people pay attention to regularly, other than direct affiliate marketing of the products you're talking about, so I'm not sure the problem is as critical as this blog post is making it out.<p>Certainly, as things are, only prolific, popular bloggers can make a living from blogging - but is it really reasonable to expect occasional or occasionally good bloggers to make a living from it?

1029052,comment,1028673,1028673,0,0,lkrubner,,,"I should say, as a warning, that I've had 3 different clients approach me with roughly this idea, since 2007. There is a lot of interest in this area. There is a lot of investment going on. I do not doubt that eventually there will be a big hit in this area, but anyone who wants to get into this area has to be aware that the competition is intense.<p>Also, attacking this idea from another angle, it should be noted that small-scale content producers are suffering badly in the current environment, and sites pitched to them  are pursuing a market where there is, potentially, very little money.<p>When I was at Bluewallllc.com we started working on iHanuman.com, which sells yoga videos. Although yoga videos represent a very small niche, the goal was to eventually reuse the technology to build other niche focused sites - an infinite range of them.<p>The ihanuman store offers some basic services to yoga teachers who have videos to sell:<p><a href=""http://www.ihanuman.com/store.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ihanuman.com/store.php</a><p>We worked on iHanuman for roughly 5 months, from April of 2007 to August of 2007. After it launched, the site was written up  in Yoga Life magazine. It attracted some traffic and developed a small but steady stream of sales. I stopped working with Bluewall in late 2007. I think they may have had one week where sales got up over $1,000. The site was never well publicized or marketed.<p>I think the project cost roughly $70,000, but it would be tough to say for sure, since the project was one of many projects that Bluewall was working on, and it would tough to say which expenses belonged to Bluewall and which expenses belonged to iHanuman. At its peak we had 5 people working on the site:<p>a designer<p>a PHP programmer (me)<p>a Flash programmer<p>an HTML/CSS specialist<p>a project manager<p>The site runs on a dedicated server from RackSpace.<p>The ultimate goal was to build a backend that would allow any yoga teacher to upload their videos and sell them. I think the revenue split, at that time, was 50/50. We got the frontend working nicely, though we never finished the backend.<p>There was some really cool technology on that project. The Flash programmer was Starrie Williamson and she did an impressive job, utilizing a lot of what was then cutting edge ActionScript 3 techniques. The Flash player could function as a widget on other websites, reading RSS feeds off of the iHanuman site (the RSS feeds were full of data from our database). In other words, it could be embedded, a lot like the YouTube player. Last I heard (early 2008), they were working on adding the ability to sell videos through the player. Very cool stuff. Anyway, if you ever need a really good Flash programmer, Starrie can be reached here:<p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/profile?goback=.con&viewProfile=&key=22608405&jsstate="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/profile?goback=.con&viewProfile=...</a><p>Some of the yoga teachers sell lectures as MP3s, and we knew we wanted to also use the same software for online music stores, so the Flash player also plays MP3s, and the PHP code handles the sale of both MP3s, FLAC files, and videos.<p>We also ported the software to the Monkeyclaus.org music store (also owned by Bluewall), and we added in the ability to import hundreds of MP3s at a time, using their embedded meta tags to fill out the info in the database. Out of all the code that I wrote for this software, almost a full year of my life (if you include the time spent on the monkeyclaus music store), this import code is the code that I am most proud of.<p>The management problems on that project were epic. The owner/designer and the project manager, who were boyfriend/girlfriend, had some strong disagreements with each other about what direction to go, and how much funding was appropriate.<p>There was, at one point, talk of pursuing a white label strategy, where Bluewall might sell the software to others. However, the code, as I left it, would not sustain a white label strategy. I wrote this code at breakneck speed. There is considerable technical debt. I was told that as soon as the site launched there would be time to clean up the code, but in fact, as soon as the site launched all development on the project ended. Also, Bluewall was very sloppy in its legal affairs - they never sought a copyright agreement with Starrie regarding her Flash player, so she still owns the copyright on it (or at least she did the last time I talked to her, which would have been the spring or summer of 2008).<p>The PHP code was written using a framework I developed during the period 2003-2007. I have since abandoned that framework and now I use Symfony for all PHP work. If I were going to do a project like that again, I'd probably build it in Symfony (or, if the JVM and Tomcat are acceptable to the project, Groovy/Grails).<p>Now, this particular project went nowhere, largely due to misjudgements on the part of those in charge. However, my point is that a lot of entrepreneurs have been looking at this space for several years now. There has been a lot of investment. The competition is intense. It might be wise to assume that there is no real profit to be made in this space, since no clear winner has emerged yet. Or you should assume that creating a winner for this space is going to be very, very hard.<p>I do believe that targeting niches is the correct way to move forward in this field. I do think that targeting indie filmmakers is an interesting and exciting niche. I have a friend who recently finished a documentary about the culture of the workers who worked at a somewhat notorious parking lot, in Charlottesville, Virginia. I'm aware that she is looking for distribution channels. But here is the problem: most indie developers will either be broke, or they will get funding, and if they have funding, they may not need this site.<p>So I would be wary.<p>All the same, if someone can go into this field and create a hit company, then they have my admiration.",1262550417

The GPL is primarily useful as a means to maintain a very specific business model that relies on selling commercial licenses. There's nothing moralistic or benevolent or ""fair"" about it -- it's simply business.<p>The only moral argument I could possibly make is that it's disingenuous if not outright hypocritical to claim that the GPL is about ""freedom"" when its used as merely a business tool that leverages the closed-source work of others to fund ongoing development.",1262549202
1029016,comment,1027811,1028396,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"> specifically the anti-atheists<p>I am not one of those. I think the Bible actually specifically teaches that this is not the case due to something called the ""common grace."" There's a Wikipedia article about it here (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_grace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_grace</a>). You can pull that out next time you meet an anti-atheist from the Christian camp (although I have never met someone like that).<p>Also the wars in the name of deities thing is bull. I am not a student of history, but in the secular school I attended growing up the history books typically taught that these wars were normally based on geopolitical aspirations. IF you believed the ""wars in the name of deities"" argument, you might be tempted to believe that Muslim extremism was the cause of recent terrorist bombings (buying into the ""they hate our freedom"" line of thought), but that too is false. Those bombing us are doing so because of specific actions that our country has taken against their people, like keeping military bases in Saudi Arabia, oppressing the people of Iran, and other things we have done.",1262549200

Although the code is under the GPL, Sun (and now possibly Oracle) has control of the brand and many of the potential revenue streams.

1029013,comment,1027785,1028974,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It is depressing. If I am about to die, I will pay whatever you want to charge. And if you collude with others, my negotiating position is toast. In addition, as a free citizen I am always able to invent a treatment that is so expensive that my fellow countrymen can't afford it. That's the nature of being a free person. Yet my fellow countrymen seem to be pretty pissed at this and are threatening to take whatever treatments I might invent and distribute them to the needy. You can call it socialism, but it's also just populist politics.<p>All this means that traditional market principles don't map exactly in the world of health care (I think they <i>mostly</i> map, just not exactly)<p>If I am not about to die, but I'm not paying my bills, then you're no longer providing me a service -- you're providing it to whoever is paying. And they're just playing numbers games trying to keep making more than they are spending.<p>There are some real, serious, foundational problems with health care. None of the current proposals by any party will even begin to fix them. What we're going to end up with, unfortunately, is a situation like every other big political problem -- the politicians will get more votes arguing about it and keeping it broken than they will actually fixing it. So it will remain broken.<p>Sorry -- not cheering you up so far, huh?<p>I could spitball some possible solutions. Make it illegal for anybody to pay my medical bills except myself, my family, and charities. Require all doctors to perform 2 years of public health service instead of some of the internships they are currently doing. Have a national standard definition of all medical procedures and require all health providers to publicly post prices for those procedures. Take the percentage of people who cannot afford treatment each year and require all health providers to provide that percentage of free service.<p>Of course none of that will ever happen.<p>I will say something political simply because it amazes me: the party who is on television right now demonizing the insurance and pharmaceutical companies is also the party that cut deals with these same industries to limit imported drugs and not have a public option. This virtually guarantees that those industries will be printing money for the foreseeable future. If I told you this five years ago you'd call me a fantastical liar. It's incredible.",1262549022

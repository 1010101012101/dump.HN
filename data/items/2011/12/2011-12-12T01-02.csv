However, IIRC, AppStore allows Frameworks. So, if a Framework is LGPL, and therefore weakly- linked, it might be just fine.<p>But, yes, it is normal that the FSF does not answer, since this is a complex issue.",1323655195

3341890,comment,3341412,3341412,18,0,cppsnob,,,"I normally wouldn't respond to a post like this but when it comes to career advice, many of you who have not been in the workforce long should hear the counterpoint.<p>The Austin businesspeople are right:  folks who want to make a lifestyle choice of going to Austin from California should get paid less to do it.  On average, they'll earn more than most people in Austin, but less than their counterparts in Silicon Valley.<p>I see no problem with this.  It's fair.  You usually only get to choose where you want to live or where you want to work.  The other one is a compromise.  That's life.  Compromises.  Why would a businessperson not take advantage of this when someone wants to live in Austin?  Maybe the OP doesn't want to live there but a lot of people do.<p>Working remotely is a compromise further:  you will get paid less, you'll get promoted less, and you will be one of the first laid off.<p>The OP can rant all she wants about ""[companies lacking] the tools to communicate remotely, [probably] can’t communicate at all"", but the all of us who have done this can tell you that remote workers are almost never as productive.  They only work for ""guy who takes the app and ports it to Android because we don't care to do it here"" type of projects.  1-3 person projects.  Large projects are hard enough to manage with the people in the office, and going remote is a nightmare.  I've even seen 10 year experts on the specific codebase try to work remotely and it be completely unproductive when they're remote.<p>There will be exceptions.  The one guy who's amazing as a remote worker.  Sales people are always an exception.  And of course, all of this turns on its head when the company is not desirable.  A crap company will pay you a lot to work remotely, then go out of business 6 months later.  Generally though, what I've spelled out here is the way it is.<p>Here's a proposal, given that she's in Austin already, the OP should demand $150K from those companies or her current employer based on this blog post.  Tell us what happens over the next 3 months, 6 months, 2 years.",1323655109

3341867,comment,3341641,3341641,57,0,secretwhistle,,,"Even though Spotify is a ""piracy killer"" (at least in Sweden, if not elsewhere), I think the labels will be more than happy to bleed it dry and leave its lifeless corpse on the side of the road as they search for the next Big Thing to strangle, bleed dry and leave behind.<p>Two reasons:<p>1. The major labels, like most of the big content producers, are extremely interested in short term gains, even if it means losses down the road. As long as something is still ""down the road,"" it won't affect this year\ns/quarter's/month's profitability.<p>Take a look at Hulu. It's a shadow of its former self. It used to be a solid site with great content, but those controlling the content have decided it's not making enough money fast enough. The fix? Remove content. Move it around. Chop it up. Stagger releases randomly. Put X season on Hulu but have Y season exist only as a selection of clips or have it go missing entirely.<p>See also: Netflix. Because the major studios are unwilling to trade DVD dollars for digital dimes, they've gone about pricing themselves out of the market. Netflix is also a ""piracy killer,"" but the studios are too concerned with getting the money up front to pay attention to how much content is being leaked out the back.<p>The studios also seem to think that people will follow them to their own sites or digital offerings, but the content they offer is generally crippled by DRM or requires the installation of proprietary software or another set of logins and passwords and people in general just do not have an interest in setting up yet another account just to watch a couple of Lost episodes.<p>2. Even though everything mentioned is a ""piracy killer,"" the simple fact is that, for many people, the service (Spotify, Netflix, etc.) becomes the end product. The services don't lead towards more sales of other physical or digital goods. This doesn't fit into the major labels'/studios' plans at all. They want to sell more of their stuff, not necessarily collect royalties from someone else's service.<p>So, if they manage to drain Spotify completely or at least force it to give up its US operations, it won't hurt them much. By that point, another service will come along and they can pile on and bleed it dry as well. The plan, I suppose, is to keep riding these little income spikes until it's 1994 again, or something.<p>They must still harbor the belief that, once the other options dry up, people will head back to the brick-and-mortar and purchase content in physical forms that carry much higher profit margins.",1323654607

To run Linux, you have to realize that the operating system is not part of the computer, care enough to install another one and spend a bit of effort getting it to work with whatever computer you have. If half the $500 laptops at Staples, for example, came with Linux, it would be much more popular.<p>There are, I think, two core reasons people cannot easily buy a laptop with Linux: Microsoft and Apple. Microsoft for its anti-competitive behavior and virtual monopoly; both companies for unrelenting marketing that presents only two options--the patently false Mac vs PC dichotomy being a perfect example.<p>I know from experience that completely technologically inexperienced people are perfectly happy with Linux as long as they're not the ones installing it. The fact that they could possibly be running KDE instead of Unity does not worry them in the slightest; in fact, particularly with Ubuntu, very little <i>does</i> worry them. My roommate, for example, has had fewer problems with Ubuntu than with Windows, and they were easier to handle.<p>In short, Linux adoption is not limited by any inherent qualities.

For one, I did not manage to be faithful to the man.  He knew that and put up with my shit for two decades anyway, in part for the sake of the children.  He never threw that in my face.  He was very decent and compassionate about the whole thing.  Plenty of men would have assaulted me for it.<p>His devotion to his career was not somehow all bad.  He was career military and we never lived in fear of him being RIFFED at a time when a RIF was ongoing.  Our marriage ended up being very traditional, a throw-back to the 50's.  I would have preferred something that gave me more freedom, but I did always appreciate that he was a good provider, he was not a drug addict or alcoholic, and he never hit me.  That may sound like a low standard, but it beats the molestation, rape and being slapped around by a drug addict that constituted parts of my childhood.<p>I have taken a class on homelessness and done volunteer work at a homeless shelter.  The kind of intractable problems I have and my children have are exactly the kind of thing that leads one to homelessness.  My spouse's military career, with excellent free medical benefits, was a big part of why we had a relatively stable middle-class lifestyle in spite of me and our oldest son having a life-threatening, very expensive medical condition which went undiagnosed for many years.<p>Feel free to talk trash about me, as I am here and choosing to air my dirty laundry.  Please refrain from jumping to ugly conclusion about my ex.  He is a decent man and he is not here to speak for himself.  It's a rather ugly tactic.<p>Also, the odds are really high that Penelope Trunk's children are not half as challenging as mine.  It's why I have a parenting site:  For some years, my advice on how to deal humanely and effectively with extremely challenging children was valued in some circles, circles that included Harvard graduates and the like who still found themselves at wit's end.  There is a lot more support for that on the web these days, but when I was actively engaged in such online communities, I was frequently the only individual in the discussion that had much in the way of meaty, substantive feedback for the most challenging situations.",1323651915

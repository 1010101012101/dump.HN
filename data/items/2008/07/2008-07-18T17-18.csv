249971,comment,249778,249933,0,0,iigs,,,"I had written up a long comment about what to do, but this more or less nails it. Here's what I had to say from a more DNS centric perspective:<p>You can do this with no downtime if you don't have any other outside circumstances forcing your hand, such as your current web hosting expiring very soon.<p>Hint: find a web based DNS test tool. Google ""DNS Report"", the dnsstuff.com one used to be really nice but they got too ambitious with a bunch of crap on their site and I think it's a pay service now, the dnscolos.com one looks like it's pretty good, I can't tell about the checkdns.net one. Also if you'll be running your own DNS services (as opposed to outsourcing them where someone else maintains the hosts) you'll want to find a DNS server package that has good documentation and good tutorials. My personal bias is toward BIND to get things going right away and then migrate to something else (PowerDNS, maybe) after you get it working because BIND is very, um, featureful, and needs updated a lot. :)<p>As you've determined, DNS servers are like web servers for static content in that you can have two different sets of them running that think they're the owners of the domain. If you give your new servers data identical to the old ones, it won't matter which set is serving your records, as the client will end up with the same data.<p>There is a notion, as you've probably read by now, of a TTL, or Time-To-Live. This is a number that goes along side your DNS response and tells the computer that your record will be staying the same for the next X seconds, so it doesn't have to ask again. Managing this in all of the records is crucial to a smooth migration.<p>You need to know the TTL of your current records. It sounds like you have a UNIXy machine at your disposal in the VPS. Log in and execute:<p>dig -t NS google.com<p>You will see a bunch of goop, but you really only care about:<p>;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com. 345600 IN NS ns4.google.com.
...<p>The 345600 is the number of seconds that the current name servers can be cached out on the internet. You won't be able to cleanly move your services faster than that if you don't control your current nameservers.<p>dig google.com @ns4.google.com<p>;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com. 300 IN A 64.233.187.99
...<p>if you care about your email you're going to need to track your MX records as well, using:<p>dig -t MX google.com @ns4.google.com<p>wherein you will see:<p>;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com. 10800 IN MX 10 smtp4.google.com.
...<p>;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
smtp1.google.com. 3600 IN A 209.85.237.25<p>Again, in all of these answers field #2 (300, 10800, 3600) are the number of seconds that each record type (A, MX, A for smtp) are cacheable by servers across the internet. You will control these on your new server.<p>You will want to set the TTL of your A (and MX) records very low on your new server. 300 seconds would be a 5 minute migration from site to site.<p>Once you have your DNS servers properly set up (dig example.com @new.srvr.ip.addr) update your information with your registrar, giving them your new name servers as the only nameservers for the account. Then the NS TTL countdown begins. In our google test case you'd have four days before you could move the site cleanly. I'm not sure if all registrars push updates hourly or not -- it used to be that they only did it once daily. I'd wait NS TTL + 24 hours to be safe, if you have the time.<p>Once everyone is visiting your new name servers, you now can migrate your non-DNS servers. All you need to do is properly update the IP addresses, which can include incrementing the zone serial numbers if you're using a BIND-alike. After updating the A (and MX) IPs you have their old TTL seconds to wait before the migration is complete and everyone should be viewing things on your new servers.<p>After your migration is complete you can (at your option) turn your TTLs back up so that the load is reduced on your DNS servers. It's not really critical to do this, but it can carry you through if your DNS servers ever have a short network connectivity outage.<p>Good luck.<p>I've glossed over a bunch of stuff (some root NS stuff, DNS is badly implemented in a lot of places, some things don't honor TTLs, and so on) but these steps should be enough to do an upgrade in the common case with no problems.",1216402310

Nothing in the world is as important to me as my work and my intellectual pursuits.</i><p>This may be unpopular on this forum, but in 10-15 years, you should expect your views to change 180 degrees. For that reason, it would be unwise for you to focus so narrowly on your ""interests"". You are young, even though you may not feel so, and are still in the process of growing. Allow yourself to do so.<p>After reading a few of your comments in addition to your post, I'm going to side with the crowd that thinks you are whining. That isn't a personal attack, but an understanding of where you are based on what you've written and where I've been in the past.<p>There are many poor college kids. In fact, I'd say 75% of them can't really afford to go to the school they go to. Yet, there they are. While not having a millionaire for a father makes life more difficult to us all, it shouldn't stop you from what you want to do.<p>Yes, getting a PT job, taking out a big loan and possibly going to a cheaper school will both be tough and a compromise from the ideal. So fucking what? 99% of life is compromise. What matters is that you continue to move in your intended direction. What you can't get today, ensure you can achieve tomorrow.<p>I don't know you, but what I read from you is fear. Fear of failing, and fear of disappointment. Your excuses are only justifications that you use to avoid admitting that you are afraid to act. This happens to everyone, and is certainly common around your age - transitioning from child to adult. Do not allow this fear to control your life, or you will never accomplish anything. You will die lonely, unloved and incomplete.<p>Your situation matters little. The obstacles in front of you are stagnant. What matters is what you choose to do. You are the part of the equation that is flexible and fluid. Don't waste that.<p>PS - Go ask that girl out. You will look back on it later and wonder what if, so save yourself the heartache by just finding out now.",1216400718

Set your TTL low now, before you the move. (Set it to about 300 seconds.) This means that many DNS servers will query your DNS box every 5 minutes, rather than waiting for a day or two.<p>You cannot know when propogation is ""officially complete"" as DNS servers around the world may not respect your TTL and serve old results for a long bit.<p>What you can do is put up a blanket webpage at the old host saying, ""Hey folks, we are moving hosts. If you want to visit the new site click here..."" and you can use the new IP address if you have your host configured properly.<p>If you don't ""have"" nameservers, you'll want to find a company like dnsmadeeasy.com that can do this for you. Many hosts will do this though. Slicehost, a VPS, has a DNS tab in their admin area. Find out if they can do this for you.<p>So the steps:<p>1) Get your new site set up. (Use step 5 liberally to test if it is working correctly without doing any switching yet.)<p>2) If your VPS does DNS, set up your records. If not, get one like DNSMadeEasy.com and set up your records. Remember to set the TTL to 300 seconds. BUT set the records to point to the IP address of your OLD host.<p>3) Go to your domain registrar like GoDaddy and change the nameserver to whatever DNS site you used in step 2. They will TELL you the names to enter, it'll be like: ns1.namehost.com, ns2.namehost.com.<p>4) Give it a couple days for the switchover.<p>5) Ok, it's the day to switch. First update your hosts file on your PC, to do a last minute test of your new site before the switch. (Add the domain and the new IP address, just google to see how this is done. This allows you to test in advance of the move.)<p>5) Now switch the A records from your old host to your new host. Tail the log file. You should see traffic in a few minutes.<p>6) Put up a webpage on the old host pointing to the new host.",1216400437

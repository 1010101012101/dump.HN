4421610,comment,4416835,4419467,1,0,urbanautomaton,,,"My preference is to have the base factories set everything that is needed for the generated record to be valid, and nothing more. If your User model validates the presence of the account, then the account association should be set - if not, it shouldn't. Otherwise, FactoryGirl.create(:user) is going to provide you with an unsaved, invalid record, which would certainly be surprising to me if I were using that factory for the first time. If all you want is a consistent set of initial attributes, then define a constant USER_ATTRIBUTES somewhere with a hash of values, and pass that to #new - using factories for this purpose is a bit sledgehammer/walnut.<p>I agree that excessive association building can get out of hand (and the latest version of FG even allows you to subscribe to factory events just so you can work out what the hell your test suite is building - a sure sign that you've lost the ability to reason about your tests if ever there was one), but completely abstaining from building associations seems to remove more or less all of the attraction of using factories as a fixture replacement in the first place.<p>All of the above applies only to integration/acceptance tests, though, where factories-as-fixture-replacements are at least arguably justifiable; my recommendation for unit tests is ""don't use factories at all.""",1345715991
4421609,comment,4421235,4421540,2,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"The caption approach often doesn't work very well in prose. The reader doesn't really want to divert their attention to a long caption, which interrupts their reading of a paragraph, if they bother they might have a hard time going back to where they left off after they've taken in the caption. This is why captions should be fairly short, especially when your reader is a reviewer who is not specifically interested in reading your paper. I actually prefer inlining my figures into the paragraph text, especially if they are short or math oriented. Reference becomes harder, but the reader's flow is better preserved.<p>Now, we can avoid that problem by moving to an illustrated comic book style (as done in Bret's example), where the figures become the story and panels are read in lieu of prose. But its very difficult to do a whole paper like this.",1345715960

4421603,comment,4420593,4420981,2,0,Goronmon,,,"The Wii is winning if the only metric is pure console sales. I know personally that even though I own one. I've played a single game on it in the last 2 years and the last 6 months it's been delegated to a Netflix machine in the bedroom. I wouldn't exactly label that ""dominance"" of the current generation.<p>Plus, all you have to do is go back a single console generation and you have the Gamecube which was absolutely dominated in pretty much any category you can think of by the Playstation 2. Even the Xbox, a console by a company no one though should develop a console, managed to beat the Gamecube in sales.<p>Go back one generation further and again the Playstation dominated the Nintendo 64.<p>I would argue that Nintendo hasn't been in a dominant position in a very long time. The sales of the Wii were a big win for Nintendo, but they aren't really delivering on the games front. The Wii was sold at a time when the casual market was ready to explode. But now it's just turned into that thing no one uses. Hell, I bought a $99 Wii for my girlfriend's parents mainly so they would be able to watch Netflix. Sure, it was another Wii sale, but that's not exactly what we usually talk about when we talk about dominance in the gaming industry.",1345715793

4421563,comment,4418904,4421479,2,0,exact-ly,,,"""centralised web"" was a poor choice of words.  And I thought about that but let it go.  You caught it.  You're paying attention.  That's good.<p>But the point is the same - the control is concentrated in middlemen (e.g. DNS, Hosting - why do I need them?[1]) - and you articulated this correctly: client-server.  Calf-cow.  Not peer-to-peer.  That's what I'm keen to get past.<p>1. That's my point about Tor's hidden services.  You need Tor's help of course but those services are free from the need for DNS and Hosting - free from the middlemen that control ""the web"" (not to mention controlling email- does anyone send email using IP numbers anymore?  the spam fighting fanatics think every revolves aroudn DNS and domain names- your mail might well get rejected because you lack a ""domain name"").  I must confess I've never actually used the hidden services.  I only read the docs and source code.<p>""Using the web doesn't mean using a web browser""<p>Not sure what you mean here.  You need to use HTTP.  So you need an http client.  Chances are you'll be fed heaps of html and other garbage.  Parsing it is a PITA.  And eventually, if you want to view tables and such, you'll be using a ""browser"".<p>Then there's the matter of state.  So you're saying HTTP but not in a RESTful way?  You just like HTTP headers, chunking and what not?  HTTP is popular but it is not exactly unique.  There are hundreds of other protocols in the RFC's, all of which would probably work just as well.  HTTP is aimed at the client-server concept.  That's fine.  But it's a limited use for a network with so much potential.  Something like a telephone conversation is not ""client-server"".<p>I'm talking about making connections that are application agnostic.  Like Ethernet.  If you're suggesting tunneling everything in HTTP I think that's unnecessary.  There are ways to deal with firewalls.  HTTP tunneling is a last resort.<p>So why HTTP?  Why does it have to be at that layer?   Why something that tied to specific applications that presume so much about what I want to do?<p>I want freedom from applications.  I can write my own apps, thanks.<p>I want freedom to create new protocols, just for me and my friends.  I want my own network, that we control.  [This is possible using stuff that's been around for many years, and I have a working prototype.  You folks are a bit too cynical to be beta testers, it's command line driven.  Maybe someday.]<p>I've tried nearly all those ""browser"" options you mentioned, believe it or not.   All except for one suck.<p>And if I had my way I'd extract the html table parser from it and have that as a standalone filter.  I'd make it a UNIX utility.<p>The whole ""browser"" concept is outdated.  People want to watch video, listen to audio, look at photos and read plain TEXT (with great fonts of course).  I don't need html to do any of those things.  And I don't need html or other HTTP junk to do search to find video, audio or images.  I need a tcp (or other) connection and a video player/audio player/image viewer/typesetter, as the task requires.<p>All that said, hypertext is neat.  But it's not world-changing.  I can still do great research without ""hyperlinks"".  Hypertext is the great benefit of HTTP.  But at this stage, it is so weighed down with cruft and used in so many silly ways, making everything dependent on a monstrous abomination of a program called a ""browser"" (Firefox is freakin HUGE),  it has become more of a burden than a benefit.  It is a limitation, not a path to the future.",1345714289

What if every website ""had to"" be readable in Braille and multiple tongues on day one, before one had the revenue to pay for that sort of thing?<p>I could NOT disagree with this more strongly. It is simply NOT acceptable to discriminate against people or exclude them, and it would NOT be acceptable to create a website that isn't readable with a screen-reader. What do you mean by ""readable in braille""? I suspect you have little notion as to what making things accessible really entails.<p>As for the larger point: this is the law. Whether you agree with it or not, every single office has to comply with this. Why should these guys get an exception just because you like what they're doing? How could the city possibly justify giving them an exemption and not every Tom Dick and Harry that asks for one after that point?",1345713789

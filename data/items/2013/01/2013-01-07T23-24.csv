Students are required to have some money aside for monthly expenses.<p>I never have heard bad stories from the family side (i.e. they end up with a bad students) as the students themselves are well filtered.

His campaign principles (and some of its messages) were then co-opted into the current-day Tea Party.<p>""Young people"" -- as much as any over-generalized demographic can agree on anything -- seem to understand the value of small government, they just want a specific kind of small government: smaller military, less international presence, more infrastructure and social welfare (both at home and abroad).<p>> <i>Dear Mr. Romney, you are pitching to the anti-Roosevelt faction of the country and it is rapidly shrinking.</i><p>Conservatism didn't suddenly appear in politics thirty years ago; it has been around, in this country, since before it was a country. In the colonial U.S., the conservatives of the time would have been called ""Tories"".<p>So while the demographics of modern conservatism might be mostly old white people, they'll either be replaced in a few years with idealistic young conservatives, or modern-day young liberals will slowly age into conservatism.<p>> <i>If the GOP pushed an ""innovation"" platform...</i><p>...then it would no longer be the GOP. The GOP is not simply a group of people who like each-other and regularly meet to decide what they should have as a platform; it is the political realization of an <i>idea</i>, the idea of conservatism. You might as well say, ""if the Democrats pushed a 'tax the poor, cut welfare, and abolish the estate tax platform'...""!<p>Conservatism exists for a good reason in society. It's there to act as society's ""rudder"", to (theoretically) keep it from evolving too rapidly and adopting too many stupid ideas. It can certainly be harmful when it gains a disproportionate amount of influence in a society, as in modern Afghanistan, but it is not inherently harmful -- and it shouldn't necessarily adopt aspects of a liberal platform.",1357602537

This, typically like European countries is not as useful as it seems as France, Italy etc. all exist both above and below the line, but there is definitely a cultural (and ethnic) difference between those living in colder and warmer climates.<p>Similarly I'd suggest the point at which grape production for wine tails off would signify the start of Northern Europe. Wine grapes are grown in England, but I wouldn't call England a big wine producing country. Similarly, the Netherlands has some wine production but I wouldn't class them as a major wine producer and as such part of Northern Europe. North of Dusseldorf or Hannover? Arguably Northern Europe. South of Dresden? Probably Central Europe.<p>I completely appreciate this is made on no scientific basis whatsoever and I'm probably completely wrong, but if you visit Spain, southern France, Italy, Greece and Western Turkey you'll see remarkable cultural and ethnic differences and similarities between them and Austria, Poland, central and southern Germany and in turn Northern Germany, the Netherlands, northern France and the UK.<p>TL;DR - Europe's a mess.

Whenever we figure out how to do something, it's no longer AI. It's statistical learning or computer vision. However, the problem of general AI turned out to be a lot harder than we thought it would be. Moravec's Paradox deserves mention here.<p>Hardware and software will interact more in the 2010s to '30s. What will people design all this awesome hardware with? Software. Taking the other direction, I do agree that the hardware world is becoming more interesting to people who might, a generation ago, have thought of themselves as ""pure software"" people. In 1985, you could ""do AI"" and never go outside of a garbage-collected language (Lisp). In 2013, it's hard to do high-performance machine learning without having some knowledge of all the neat things people can do with hardware (e.g. GPU programming). Also, the existence of continuing education options like Coursera is making people more Y-shaped than T- or I-shaped.<p>I agree with you that a lot of the ""hot"" work in the social media world (learning a bunch of damn APIs) isn't very hard, deep, or interesting.

It's no wonder that scrolling performance is choppy.</i><p>None of this is true. First, the 15"" retina mbp has a nvidia GT650M along with an intel gpu. And it's still not enough. Remember that a game running at 2880x1800 using filtering can use memory-bandwidth saving tricks like quincunx which can't be used in a desktop environment. Moreover, in the 'scaled-up' 1920x1200 mode the rMBP supports, the rMBP is essentially super-sampling a much larger pre-display buffer than 2880x1800<p>Have a read:<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6023/the-nextgen-macbook-pro-with-retina-display-review/8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6023/the-nextgen-macbook-pro-w...</a><p><i>At the default setting, either Intels HD 4000 or NVIDIAs GeForce GT 650M already have to render and display far more pixels than</i> either GPU was ever intended to.

At 2880 x 1800 most interactions are smooth but things like zooming windows or scrolling on certain web pages is clearly sub-30fps. At the higher scaled resolutions, since the GPU has to render as much as 9.2MP, even UI performance can be sluggish. Theres simply nothing that can be done at this point - Apple is pushing the limits of the hardware we have available today, far beyond what any other OEM has done. Future iterations of the Retina Display MacBook Pro will have faster hardware with embedded DRAM that will help mitigate this problem. But there are other limitations: many elements of screen drawing are still done on the CPU, and as largely serial architectures their ability to scale performance with dramatically higher resolutions is limited.</i><p><i>One could argue that the choice of terrible Intel GPUs is actually to improve battery life, not to save money; that might be true. But in that case, why not include their (rather well implemented) GPU-switching technology in all Retina macbooks? Why only the 15""?</i><p>It has a bigger battery.",1357600795

I appreciate that using outside help to build a team is not right for every stage company.<p>After looking at the dismal state of recruiting and the enormous typical placement fees that well exceed $25K on avg across the US for developer positions, we feel our pricing is comparatively low and the experience and results, superior.<p>We found that matchmaking developers and companies may seem like simple quick transactions, and many recruiters treat it that way, but the reality is it is a time intensive process to do it right.<p>(EDIT: typo)",1357600315

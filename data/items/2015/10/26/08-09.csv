Increase launch capacity and cable-laying speed.<p>It might be worth it to lay some secret, dark fiber, but beats me how you get away with doing that without the Russians finding out.<p>If true, the Russians are clearly exploring new territory here. It&#x27;s increasingly obvious that there is a low-level cyberwar well underway between the Russians, Chinese, and United States (and their proxies). I <i>think</i> the Chinese would be happy to keep the game at just under the kinetic level, but the Russians seem hell-bent on seeing how far they can push things -- probably because of how terribly things are going at home.<p>One thing is for certain: there will be a counter to this. Lots of tech available like microwave repeaters, blimps, LEO sats, and so on.

Maybe teachers were a mixed bag since you can also have old school catholic/religious institutions that would have really retrograde teachers, but again, at least in the infrastructure side money did seem to buy much better things.<p>That might also have to do with the fact that taxes in Mexico are not prioritized for education and so most public schools are really lacking in pretty much everything. Students and teachers basically put a significant part of the expense in school materials as well as things like paint for the buildings, repairing broken bathrooms, etc. It&#x27;s a really dire situation that gets worse every day.<p>Under this context then, a private institution that can raise a significant amount of money from parents, will usually manage to make a very big difference.<p>We are talking about the difference between having a public college where most bathrooms were non functional, had no toiler paper or soap (so pretty much only running water if that) vs a private college where there is a Starbucks inside campus and other such amenities (like fully functional bathrooms and plenty of them, etc).

I remember reading about how Emacs is tested by volunteers on older systems just to make sure new changes don&#x27;t break compatibility. I think such stories are really interesting because they reveal the history behind the software we use today. And in some cases it makes sense to support older hardware, considering how much of our society still runs on old, but stable, computers. Thanks for mentioning CICS - that was new to me.<p>What struck me as interesting with the old code in NEURON is that NEURON is a high performance simulator still in heavy development. There appears to me few good reasons to run a simulation for a year on a Tektronix 4010 that would take a minute on a laptop. So while I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see Emacs&#x27; old stuff still being used, I would assume that NEURON&#x27;s old code is simply abandoned and was never cleaned up.",1445846700

Some people would say the world&#x27;s best :) Gotta say, I haven&#x27;t heard a whole lot of people championing the passive voice! If you have an idea to communicate, it strikes me as strange that you would want to leave out information - which is my biggest problem with the passive voice. &quot;Is rumored to be&quot; is a shifty way a writer can avoid telling you <i>who</i> started the rumor. I find it depressing to read all the comments on this post. I hoped there would be more intellectual seriousness on HN, and I have big doubts about how mature a person can be if they haven&#x27;t gotten over the desire to write like a grown-up, instead of actually conveying a point in a simple way. I&#x27;m not a Paul Graham fanboy, but he couldn&#x27;t be more right in this case.",1445846532

See how affiliate marketing works: it&#x27;s CPA for all intents and purpose masquerading under a different name. The biggest difference might be that the vendor will contact you, rather than make some kind of bid, if he thinks you&#x27;ve the right kind of traffic.<p>If your audience is interested in a particular product, you quickly discover it through common sense and trial and error, as you can normally see the click-through rates.<p>Also, a big ticket item with a low conversion rate sometimes earns better than a smaller one with a high conversion rate.

The point here is you don&#x27;t\nwrite much networking, you write message handling exactly in the same manner\nas you would for communicating inside the application, without any networking.\n0MQ, WCF and JMS don&#x27;t even remotely resemble the operation model for network\nconnectivity in Erlang.<p>3? (Let it crash) And you needed to specifically design your application,\nincluding supervision (you do have it, right?). Erlang provides all that\nalready.<p>4. You didn&#x27;t get what supervision is about. It&#x27;s about restarting process\nwhen it crashes, crashing <i>all</i> the <i>related</i> processes and aborting when\nrestarts are too frequent.<p>> It&#x27;s easier to get staff,<p>It&#x27;s easier to get <i>some</i> staff, but it may be much harder to get <i>good</i>\nstaff. Signal-to-noise ratio is very bad among Java programmers. And it&#x27;s\nquite hard to find bad Erlang programmer once you find somebody who can write\nin Erlang (or learn it quickly).<p>It&#x27;s not that Erlang provides one specific killer feature that makes it great\nchoice. It&#x27;s that Erlang provides plenty of nice things already built in, and\nall that sums up to a platform that one would want to use every day. You don&#x27;t\nhave good binaries syntax on top of JVM. You don&#x27;t have good logging framework\nin standard JVM. You still need external libraries for sensible network\nprogramming. You have to design your application specifically to handle\nthread failures. You can&#x27;t just spawn a thread for every request running and\nbe done with the job. You don&#x27;t have a distributed soft real-time database.\nAnd the list goes on.<p>You just need to do much work before you even start programming, and then to\nmanage all that (which is no easy task), just because your platform doesn&#x27;t\nprovide any of the mentioned things and its working model is less convenient\nfor writing network services.",1415357802

I&#x27;ve never had to use one in the real world in any of the sectors I&#x27;ve worked in.<p>3. Let it crash: we do this. In fact we force <i>threads</i> to crash if they do anything bad by throwing an exception that isn&#x27;t caught. All threads are designed to be idempotent, restartable and transaction aware. This is true in JVM/CLR at least.<p>4. Supervision: New thread, new state, no shared state. Not hard. PHP does this...<p>5. Inspection: I&#x27;ve seen the Erlang toolchain and it&#x27;s pretty good but I&#x27;m not joking but inspecting and debugging the state of a system is better when there is lots of pooled knowledge (google) and lots of diverse tools. JVM wins there every time.<p>7. Messaging is not RPC: It&#x27;s not in JMS either or WCF. It abstracts the transport away. In fact we have inproc transports in some cases that use concurrent collections to throw messages around.<p>8. Dialyzer: compiler, static typing (Java is less strong here to be honest than say C#).<p>I really like the idea of Erlang but the worse is better mantra applies here. It&#x27;s easier to get staff, the knowledge when something goes pop is available, we benefit from the reuse of billions of lines of code written and tested by others if we pick a JVM. If we have to think a bit or throw some more kit at it, so be it.<p>Edit: just to add, I&#x27;m not knocking Erlang and quite like it in principle (I spent 2 months disassembling CouchDB to see if we could maintain it so it&#x27;s not a foreign language to me), but the justifications in the reply aren&#x27;t particularly unique ones nor are they major advantages.",1415356045

If they were issuing those certs, it&#x27;d be hard to tell if you were on the actual hidden service operated by the entity known to humans as Facebook -- given how ad-hoc the name &quot;facebookcorewwwi.onion&quot; is, the cert isn&#x27;t making a useful statement the same way a cert for &quot;facebook.com&quot; is.<p>And that&#x27;s not even considering the fact that Tor&#x27;s transport to hidden services implies authenticity... DigiCert is unable to usefully contribute to the claim &quot;these people own facebookcorewwwi.onion&quot; or &quot;these people own facebookrotflbbq.onion&quot; because Tor is already making that claim strongly, so the only claim they can help with is &quot;these people are/aren&#x27;t who you think of as Facebook&quot;.<p>If DigiCert were able to issue an EV cert for &quot;Facebook, Inc.

Depression, like many other illnesses, is a private matter and only the person suffering has the right to decide who to tell and how much information to share.  The fact that Dan Ha is missing does not change this.<p>Second, while the onset of depression can sometimes be triggered by one or more specific events, the truth is that many cases of depression have no discernible cause.  When someone says that &quot;depression needs no reason&quot;, they simply mean that there doesn&#x27;t need to be any specific trigger.  Of course there is something underlying the condition - whether it&#x27;s caused initially by an event, some chemical imbalance in the brain, some combination of the two, or something else that we don&#x27;t understand yet, the point is that it doesn&#x27;t have to be caused by &quot;some painful event&quot;.<p>Third, don&#x27;t assume that depression is a sudden condition.  It can creep up on you over time without you realizing it.  Or maybe you do realize it, but you do your best to handle it, to get over it on your own, to hide it from others.  You can have highs and lows (not to be confused with bipolar or manic episodes), rather times when you feel you are doing better or worse.  Maybe you go a week or a month thinking it&#x27;s gone, only to wake up one morning with depression making itself known again.  It can be months or years before anyone else notices, if they ever do.  And the ones who do?  It&#x27;s not necessarily your closest friends - it could be a casual acquaintance or a coworker who notices the change.<p>Depression can consume you.  You might think it just means feeling bad, but it can be much worse than that.  It can mean feeling dead inside, or not feeling anything at all.<p>Even when you make a choice to accept help (whether you seek it out or it&#x27;s forced on you - hopefully before you do something extremely stupid), it can take a long time to recover.  Medication often helps, even though we don&#x27;t no exactly why - yes, we know approximately how the medication changes things in your brain - affecting dopamine uptake, for example, but we don&#x27;t know why it does it.  And it&#x27;s not a matter of simply going on medication.  You have to work with your doctor to figure out the right level for you - and that level might change over time.  What worked for a time may be too much later, causing side effects that leave you feeling bad.  Adjusting the dose can mean feeling worse for a couple of weeks while you wait for your body and mind to adjust!  You sit at work feeling like you&#x27;re about to fall asleep, and when you try to go to bed you stare at the ceiling for hours.  You might be sitting or walking and feel a wave of dizziness.  You gain or lose weight, seemingly without changes to your diet or routine.  Even though you&#x27;re not as depressed, it can be hard to go out and do things with people, leaving you feeling isolated.<p>Therapy can help at times, but it also takes time.  You don&#x27;t just sit down with a doctor and establish trust right away.  It takes multiple sessions for a psychiatrist/psychologist to make a diagnosis.  And they might not be the ones who can recommend medication either, so you still have to work with another doctor at the same time.  Short term therapy ends up lasting for months, or years.<p>Finally, do you know what can be the worst thing about depression?  People who tell you that there&#x27;s no reason for you to be depressed.  People who think it&#x27;s easy to &quot;stop thinking that way!&quot;  People who think that you ought to know why it&#x27;s happening.  People who say &quot;get over it, you&#x27;ve got it good.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t believe you know what causes depression because even the people who spend their lives studying it admit that they can&#x27;t really explain it yet - they can&#x27;t put together the puzzle because they still haven&#x27;t even found all the pieces!",1415354467

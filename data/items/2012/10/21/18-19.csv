Dice ware is nice. Something such as this:<p>""lua ham purple day girl""<p>The challenge with primary authentication passwords is that users typically cannot use a password manager or generator to recall the password and thus must be able to recall something that they can easily type and end-up selecting weak passwords. There are some exceptions to this (yubikey, etc) but most normal users don't or cannot use them for various reasons, so go with a nice pass phrase like the one above.",1350845958

4680440,comment,4679539,4680356,2,0,disgruntledphd2,,,"Jung did his thesis in 1903. In 1903, regression had been invented, but was in England and may not have spread very far from there. Fisher was 13, and had not yet invented maximum likelihood and the application of statistics to experimental design that we all benefit from today. Karl Pearson was working on statistics, and had invented the chi squared three years previously. He was in the process of generalising regression analysis in 1903.<p>Multiple regression (OLS) had not yet been invented. I'm not sure how you expect Jung to have used an apparatus of statistics which really wasn't developed (till Fisher) into a coherent whole when Jung would have been in his forties, having already written a number of books.<p>Statistics in the sense of looking at populations did exist, but the whole apparatus of modern statistics was developed in the early part of the 20th century, concurrent with Jung.<p>I agree with your definition of science. Incidnetally, Hans Eysenck developed a physiological test for extraversion/ introversion in the 1950's involving the amount of stimulus required to become noticeable to a person. This has been comfirmed by further research.<p>Speaking as a (soon to be) psychology PhD (all going well...) I would argue that the ""soft"" sciences  have the exact opposite problem, in that, jealous of all the cool theories of the physicists they have attempted to jump straight to the theory building without the benefits of hundreds of years of observation.<p>I agree that models in the soft sciences are somewhat simplistic, but I actually think that they're not simplistic enough. We (as a species) need to figure out some invariants if we're ever going to do successful science on people and the systems we create.<p>Back to Jung, while he didnt use the statistics that we would today, he did spend an awful lot of time attempting to figure out why we are the way we are, without resorting to sex sex sex (like the inimitable Freud). Personally, at this point he's probably better read as a philosopher and student of human nature, but he is well worth reading in that capacity.<p>That being said, he's an awful writer so it is a bit of struggle. Well worth it though, in my opinion.",1350845766

Also- its important to note a few things: 1) the embassy storming was carried out on a whim by one group of over eager revolutionaries, it was not officially sanctioned until it was a fait accomplie, 2) saying the 1979 revolution was a direct result of the 1953 coup is bumbling self centrism at best - a lot happened in the country over that period that culminated in the revolution. Which leads to 3) Khomeini was not the stated aim of the revolution- a democracy was. Khomeini and the Islamists hijacked the revolution and killed, imprisoned, or exiled all other parties involved until that point. They have maintained control since then with history's most sophisticated religio-political machinery combining censorship and xenophobia, police state security infrastructure, and a unique brand of divine mysticism.

Anyhow - during conversation I asked how my nephew is doing, he's 4.  She said he won't sleep in his room for the last week.  I said 'oh? is that bad?'.<p>Apparently she heard someone upstairs walking around then all of sudden he started screaming hysterically.  She said it took her 10-15 min to bring him awake, into full consciousness.  He said someone was in his room - on the ceiling.  I'm like ""Uhh...hmm that's weird"".<p>She goes on to tell me he's had an imaginary friend - Maria.  He's seen him talking to her, playing with her etc...  I said ""when did this all happen?"".  She said after her mother-in-law gave her an old chair that belong to a great grandmother or something.<p>Then she goes on to tell me that her mother-in-law came over to drop off old picture for her husband.  One of them my nephew points out ""Maria!""...his imaginary friend, the lady who the chair belonged to...<p>Needless to say - she doesn't think Maria is bad - but perhaps someone else is there or got invited in.<p>After smudging the house - which she said was very odd because the house started creaking like crazy, everything has subsided - and they got rid of the chair.<p>Anyhow - I considered getting the chair to play a prank on some friends - see if anything happens to them.<p>Always hear of ghost stories but kind of cool when you bump into one so close.",1350845663

4680426,comment,4679906,4680411,4,0,tptacek,,,"This was fun to read; thanks. It's interesting how side channel attacks can be both assisted and complicated by new hardware; usually, advances in hardware tend to favor attackers slightly more than defenders, but even just by pushing operations below attacker measurement thresholds --- without even trying, that is --- hardware makes some side channels very hard to exploit.<p>If you're an HN'er reading along at home, Aciicmez' BTB timing paper (you should just be able to Google that) is very very very cool. They not only realized that you could theoretically watch the caches used by the branch predictor to build a trace from which you could recover RSA keys, but also came up with a very simple way to profile those branch predictor caches; that is, they designed a ""spy process"" like Osvik and Tromer did for memory caches that targeted the BTB instead.",1350845519

We now have some Marketing and Strategy presence here, but operations remains firmly in Austin.<p>Equally, I personally wouldn't put a heavily social-orientated company in Austin as there are many important partners you need to get chummy with to succeed who are based in SF/Bay Area.<p>It's just about weighing up what labor and partners you need, and putting your company where it needs to be.

4680411,comment,4679906,4680301,6,0,blazingice,,,"Aciicmez's BTB attack looks at the branch predictor, and is potentially valid against any implementation which branches based on sensitive data. There's a whole class of these attacks which look at instruction paths, including a new one by Zhang et. al. against ElGamal at CCS this year, but they usually target asymmetric ciphers. In particular, since AES doesn't have key-dependent branching, these attacks don't apply.<p>I do agree with you that x86-64 is extremely complicated, and that new attacks might crop up due to some future optimization.<p>As for the paper:<p>Yeah, AES-NI is sort of the final hammer against AES cache timing attacks, since it doesn't use the cache at all, but I felt that a paper on AES cache timing would be remiss without mentioning it :)<p>There are two parts to the multicore argument: the first is that it complicates things massively, and the second is that  it can be a complete mitigation if used properly.<p>First is the complication bit, and that's just saying that the attacker must understand almost everything about the multicore implementation, including multilevel cache behavior and (possibly non-deterministic?) replacement strategy. I'm willing to believe that, were this the only hurdle, a dedicated attacker could still succeed. I was looking at a single core machine, so I didn't have to deal with the complexity here.<p>For the complete mitigation, you need to rely on platform support for core pinning. If you're allowed to say ""I want to do encryption now, give me my own core for 400ms"", then, since the 4KiB T-tables fit into your core's L2, attacker threads on other cores just can't examine them during use. This complicates the VM hosting model and might be a decent DOS attack, but it does completely stop cache probing attacks.<p>Finally, as you said, my work can really only apply to AES on the x86 on the desktop. Change one of these variables (such as AES to ElGamal or RSA or Blowfish), and side channel attacks might still exist. Such is the problem with negative results :)",1350845098

The fact that my girlfriend died did something to me that at first was something that came to me as the shock.

I came within a hair's breadth of losing my infant daughter to cancer just over a year ago, and a few things come up in my thoughts:<p>- Not all medical systems are the disaster described here. We elected to move back from the US to our native Canada to undergo treatment, and our experience in ward (pre and post-op as well as on the oncology floor) was a dream (at least given the circumstances). We experienced nothing but exemplary inter-disciplinary cooperation, compassion for the patient (and family) experience, and a professionalism driven by clinical need rather than liti-mitigation. These qualities were exhibited even more strongly during the initial phases of treatment post-discovery, which unfolded along a timeline similar to the one discussed here.<p>- Academic hospitals <i>are</i> exhausting. My spouse ended up being the real hero in this story (she was still breastfeeding at the time, and only one parent was allowed to overnight in the room). My job was to make sure she and our daughter had recovered enough each day to make it through a night of vitals, endless beeping, and the occasional overnight chemo administration (don't even get me started about that).<p>- The need for patients and their families to drive the narrative of their hospital experience and be their own champion is critical. I had worked in healthcare for many years before this nightmare began (my old office was at the hospital across the street from her room) and knew the system very, very well. We divided up responsibilities so 'I looked outward, and [my spouse] looked inward', meaning that I spent my time making sure that the relevant referrals happened, that medications were administered on time and on dose, and so on. My wife looked inwards towards our daughter, making sure she was fed, entertained, and comfortable. This setup worked very well for us, and was a likely contributor to our level of care.<p>- The power of parents to be strong in the face of terrible (often inevitable) odds is truly inspiring. We were lucky enough to know with reasonable certainty fairly early on that we would one day be leaving the hospital and resuming a normal life. Many, many families we met were not so lucky. To see a parent express joy and love in the face of such long and terrible odds is a truly unique experience. I myself am a measurably better parent for having witnessed it.",1350843766

While I do understand where you're coming from I'm hesitant to say its okay to willfully replace ads on web pages. That's a point I don't have very strong opinions on but I do strongly believe that plugins like the one in question are unquestionably unethical and not okay.<p>You do own your browser but you don't own the sites you visit or their content. To me when someone argues for being able to replace ads on a website that's almost the equivalent of saying ""I am entitled to take ownership of and alter anything I lay my eyes on"". Some people counter by arguing that if it's not alright to replace ads then it's not okay to use custom CSS rules or plugins or apps designed to enhance readability. The fundamental difference between those things is that site owners want you to read their content and almost universally happily accept people using custom CSS and readability type plugins but replacing ads is different in that you are making a choice to put someone else's content on their site to the site owmer's detriment. If I were running a site that relied on ad revenue I'd almost prefer plugins that stripped out the ads altogether to one's that replace ads with one's that someone else will profit from. In the case of the former you could reasonably assume the visitor wouldn't be clicking any ads anyway but in the case of the latter that user may still click and youd get nothing.<p>Imagine there was an eyeglass company that sold glasses that would replace certain things you saw with other things that they decided on. I know this is far out but just follow me here. Now imagine owners of these glasses walk into a mall and the glasses replaced window signage and ads with ones from the eyeglass maker's preferred partners. The shop owners in the mall would be upset but the maker of the eyeglasses would claim they're just giving their customers the deals they want. And then a certain portion of the people who wear these glasses say ""I own my eyes. I may choose to replace anything I see with whatever I want"".<p>In 1996 I was 10 years old and grew up from that point on with the web. Ads were annoying for a time but the people posting and creating them learned really fast that their strategy wasn't working and from then on ads have been pretty polite. They mostly just sit in their grid positions. Sometimes they're animated and sometimes they have sound but it's off by default. I don't get why people hate online ads so much. They're easy to ignore and rarely if ever become intrusive these days. But that's a whole 'neither topic. My main point is that suppressing ads is one thing but to replace ads with others that deprive a site from the CPC revenue is unequivocally wrong. It may be legal but it's wrong.",1350843310

And it is a scathing, justified criticism, especially coming from an experienced doctor.<p>My father died of lung cancer, and we went through similar experiences with the health care system.<p>Before claiming that something is not a criticism, we have to ask whether or not we can imagine a better outcome, ask what is getting in the way of that outcome, and then make a change. This could be something small, like moving patients around less, and with less resistance. (The purely <i>informational</i> resistance in medical care is appalling, and this story shows it's real human cost. Electronic patient records is not about assuaging ""people who can't be bothered to fill out forms"".) Or it could be something huge, like revolutionizing what late-stage cancer patients, and their families, expect, and how they will be treated.<p>If you get late-stage cancer, the health insurance company should hand you $100,000 in cash, a large supply of morphine that can be easily self-administered, and a ticket to Hawaii.

But your paper also takes on Osvik and Tromer, who used ""spy processes"" to continuously probe local caches to create traces that could be analyzed for key information. I know your paper mentions branch prediction and says you don't have results for it, but what's your take on whether Aciicmez's BTB attack is going to remain viable?<p>I thought the BTB attack was the cleverest and most disquieting of the bunch, in that it suggested that we don't even know enough about the x86-64 microarchitecture to predict what side channel vulnerabilities we might have in software AES.<p>Regarding the paper itself: the most provocative claim it makes is that we're trending towards ""complete mitigation"" of cache side channel attacks. You give two reasons: AES-NI and multicore systems.<p>The AES-NI argument seems compelling but a little obvious, in the same sense as one could have argued that peripherals that offloaded AES would also blunt attacks against software AES. AES-NI blurs the line between software and hardware AES, but it's still a hardware implementation.<p>Another argumentative point that could be made here is, AES-NI mitigates cache-timing attacks against systems that use <i>AES</i>. It doesn't do much good if you can't use AES, since the most popular block ciphers that compete with AES are also implemented with table lookups.<p>I found the multicore argument a lot less compelling, since it relied in part on the notion that attackers wouldn't easily be able to predict the cache behavior of their target multicore systems. It seems to me that the most likely environment in which cache timing attacks are going to be a factor on the Internet is shared hosting environments, in which attackers with the sophistication to time AES are easily going to be able to get a bead on exactly what hardware and software they're aiming at. Most users of AES are also using off-the-shelf hardware and software.",1350842694

That means that no number may be more than 100 away from any other number once fully sorted (7 bits).  Therefore, you can simply use deltas to encode your numbers, as 7 bit deltas * one million numbers < 1 MB RAM.<p>EDIT: should've been clearer: no number may be more than 100 away from any other number <i>on average</i> once fully sorted.  Therefore, it's an average of 7 bits per number, maximum.  Duplicates are even easier, since it's only one bit to encode the duplicate (a delta of zero).<p>EDIT 2: As for the encoding to be used, I think a universal code or Golomb code would probably be sufficient.

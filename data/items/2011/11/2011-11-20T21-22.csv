Blocks of text become difficult to read (and also ugly) when lines get to a certain length. The rule of thumb is that about 60-80 characters per line is comfortable. On my display, this site has about 250 characters per line and it makes me want to hit the back button. Yes, I can use Readability, but that strips out the code formatting. Simple fix: put a containing div around your content, and set a max-width on that container.<p>See Jashkenas's work for examples of well-formatted technical writing:<p><a href=""http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/</a><p><a href=""http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs/grammar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs...</a><p>Anyway, looks like a nice resource.

Good CNC usually requires two tool-tilt axes in addition to the standard X, Y, and Z - for a total of 5 axes, and everything has to be a <i>lot</i> stronger to apply enough pressure to the tool without warping. Hopefully once everyone has a 3D printer they'll use it to print some CNC parts and kick that movement into gear...<p>With that said, a 3D printer can be repurposed into a very weak 3-axis router pretty easily. Provided you move the tool head slowly enough and are cutting something very weak, they work okay.<p>The fundamental concept (having a computer move a tool head) is the same - 3D printers are just built out of weaker/smaller (and hence cheaper) parts.",1321825538

It's no big mystery, Apple saw the situation and realized that without the unlocked option on the table, many people would simply refuse to upgrade because their carrier wouldn't let them for another couple years.<p>I'm sure someone else already covered the fact that mobile long distance is a concept exclusive to Canada and still exists in the year 2011.<p>Honestly, besides some token niceties (the 6GB/$30 plan, free tethering, and one of the lowest subsidized prices for the iPhone in the world, $159) we are completely screwed.

3259075,comment,3256748,3256748,1,0,algoshift,,,"These easy definitions always bother me.  ""The only purpose of corporations is to maximize shareholder profit.""  Really?  The only purpose?  Shareholder profit or value is a side effect of producing products or services that people want.  The purpose of a corporation is to focus on what it does and do it well.  Shareholders benefit from this activity.<p>Anyone who starts or runs a company and says ""My only purpose is to increase shareholder profit"" is probably going to fail to deliver.<p>The other one is this issue of ""corporate greed"" or this idea of outsourcing to lower cost manufacturing centers in order to make more money.  As someone who has the scars to show for it, I can tell you that ""greed"" is never a part of it.<p>Imagine, if you will.  That you are making widget A in the US or Europe.  You are doing well.  Everything is manufactured in house or locally.  Profits are good.<p>Now, imagine that a competitor decides that they can beat you at your own game and make widget A for less money if they outsource their manufacturing to, say, China.<p>Their list price is now lower than yours by a bunch.  
You don't want to loose market share, so you lower your list price.  Only to discover that now your profits can't support your US-based operations.  Just can't do it.<p>What are your choices?  You can't automate your way out of the problem because you are already as efficient as you can be.  You could leave the market altogether and move on.  Lay off everyone in that division and lick your wounds.<p>Or, as it is more often the case than not, you can follow-suit and find your own manufacturing solution in China.  Now you can lower your prices to match or improve upon your competitors's pricing and you've restored balance to the force.<p>Or so you thought.  At this point nobody is making as much money as they used to.  But, a race to the bottom ensues.  Very soon Asian manufacturers enter the fray.  Not only are they the beneficiaries of low-cost manufacturing, they also benefit from a far lower regulatory burden as well as not having to deal with progress-killing unionized labor and their ridiculous rules and costs.<p>The race to be bottom continues. Only that you and your local competitors are now at a serious disadvantage with respect to your Asian competitors.<p>What to do?  Well, again, you could leave the segment, fire everyone and move on.  Maybe you license IP and life is grand.  Or, you could take it a step further and become a brand behind a product that you barely touch.  Sure, you have to slim down the ranks but the business continues to exist in some form.<p>At no point in this slippery-slope is anyone thinking about getting rich.  In fact, the effect can be quite the opposite.  Profits become thin and the business suffers for it.  You've taught your competitors how to make your products and have very little more than a brand to use as an advantage over them.  You can't make anything any more and simply don't have the equipment, facilities, process, skill-set, network and people to even attempt to compete with anyone.<p>And life goes on.<p>To say that these corporations are ""greedy"" and that their ""only purpose"" is to provide shareholder value is, in my never-humble opinion, to be utterly ignorant of the day-to-day realities they have to face.<p>The reality of the situation is that, over the last 50 years, we have collectively opened Pandora's box.  Consumers have voted with their buying power to overwhelmingly favor product that can only be manufactured in places like China due to cost structures.  Given this, closing Pandora's box is as close to impossible as you can get.<p>MBA's and corporations cannot force consumers to behave altruistically and support locally made --higher cost-- product when they can drive over to Walmart and overdose on product at much lower price points and, yes, very good quality in most cases.<p>There's that scene the ""Outsourced"" movie that kind of encapsulates the whole phenomenon:  A caller wants to buy a bald eagle statue but complains that it is made in China.  The operator indicates that they have US-made versions and she'd be happy to sell him one.  Only that the US-made version is over $200 when the Chinese version is $20.  The caller goes with the Chinese version.<p>Attention Walmart shoppers: You reap what you sow.",1321824733

But OO is an ambiguously defined paradigm and unlike functional programming doesn't really have a definitive calculus. However, Peter Landin did show that untyped OO could be reduced to lambda calculus.<p>I think there is a difference between OO as it is practiced and interpreted by mainstream languages such as Java, C++ and how it was originally intended to work (a la Smalltalk, Self). Interestingly as someone who got started with Scheme, I found that Javascript actually helped me understand OO and FP in a more integrated way: Functions/closures as these hybrid Objects or vice versa Objects as Functions/closures. Objects were intended to just abstract away the structure of data and state (but I see lots of OO that treats objects like data structures with lots of mutable state) whereas with functions they are coupled to the representation of the data structure, which is fine if there is either a small set of data structures (lists/trees for Lisp/Scheme) or the domain you're modeling has an optimal stable data representation.<p>Also after looking at Self, I think class based OO is a more difficult starting point into OO. Inheritance is one modeling method of OO but is way over used. And cause me all sorts of frustration when I started OO.<p>So if you think you don't like OO, you have to really define for yourself what OO to you means. It means a lot of things to different people. For java programmers it means making everything into classes and interfaces, lots of types and hierarchies, no lambdas(yet?). Some assume the difference between FP and OO is mutable state or first-class-functions. But I don't believe so.<p>It is really an approach to abstraction: does the structure of the data change more than the operations on that data, then OO is better suited there.",1321824448

Having done it both ways, I now prefer to build as much of my app using libraries that I trust and code we write ourselves, rather than use plugins or builders.  It's much easier to optimize and maintain in the long run, and a lot of it is easier to write than you may think (especially if you are not trying to solve for the general case).

I think that a lot of the core skills you described are certainly developed in good law schools, but they are also developed well in lots of different academic paths.  For instance, suppose someone double majored in mathematics and english literature with exceptional grades, followed it up with a grad degree.  Should that person be forced to go through three years of law school?  If this person were allowed to pass the bar and was able to do so, should we deny him or her the right to enter the profession?  Would this person be ready with a one year course of study (maybe a master's degree)?  Even if it would be ""better"" for this person to do the full JD, is it worth the additional time and money (and deterrence)?  Are we better off as a society if this person gives up on law?  (People who hold JDs are probably better off, which of course has a lot to do with how rigorously the JD is enforced as barrier to entry).<p>There's a big difference between defending the JD as a good way to prepare for a career in law and defending the JD as the <i>only</i> way to enter the legal profession.",1321822941

Not so much... deal fatigue is a real issue but traveling is something a ton of people do daily. Aggregation is something anyone can do as well and I find it hard to believe a sustainable long term business can be built upon this model.. I mean seriously, take a moment to think about this without any bias? A business? A legit business? Aggregation of deals?.. really? really?",1321822896
